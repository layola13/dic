  "definition": "The term 'superobjects' is primarily used within the context of theoretical physics, specifically in string theory and related areas. Superobjects are extended objects that possess both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom, combining properties of particles and strings. They are generalizations of point particles and strings and can take the form of branes (p-branes), which are extended objects with p spatial dimensions.",
  "example": "In string theory, superobjects like D-branes play a crucial role in understanding non-perturbative aspects of the theory.",
