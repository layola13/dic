  "translation": "绒毡层",
  "definition": "A layer of nutritive cells lining the anther of a flower, important for the development of pollen grains. Also, in animals, it refers to a layer of tissue in the eye immediately behind or within the retina of some vertebrates that enhances light reflection.",
  "example": "The tapetum in the anther provides nutrients for the developing pollen grains. / The tapetum lucidum in a cat's eye reflects light, causing it to shine in the dark.",
  "synonyms": ["none"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "botany": [
      {
        "context": "In botany, tapetum refers to a specialized layer of nutritive cells found within the anther of flowering plants.",
        "example": "The tapetum plays a crucial role in pollen development by providing essential nutrients and precursors."
      },
      {
        "context": "The development and function of the tapetum are essential for successful sexual reproduction in plants.",
        "example": "Defects in tapetum development can lead to male sterility due to impaired pollen formation."
      },
      {
        "context": "There are two main types of tapetum: secretory (glandular) and amoeboid (invasive).",
        "example": "In the secretory tapetum, cells remain in place and secrete nutrients, whereas in the amoeboid tapetum, cells break down and their contents are absorbed by the developing pollen."

        "example": "The tapetum lucidum enhances night vision by reflecting light back through the photoreceptors."
      },
      {
        "context": "The presence of a tapetum lucidum is common in nocturnal animals.",
        "example": "Animals such as cats, dogs, deer, and many others have a tapetum lucidum that gives their eyes a characteristic 'eye shine' at night."

      {
        "context": "The tapetum lucidum is not present in humans.",
        "example": "The absence of a tapetum lucidum in humans is one reason why our night vision is poorer compared to many animals."
