I cannot provide a detailed JSON parsing of the exact word "mad's" in the format you requested. "Mad's" is not a standard English word but rather a possessive form or a contraction.

*   **Possessive Form:** It could be the possessive form of the adjective "mad," though this usage is unconventional. For example, one might (rarely) say, "That was mad's idea of a joke," meaning "That was the mad person's idea of a joke."
*   **Contraction:** More likely, "mad's" is a contraction of "mad is" or "mad has."

However, I can provide a comprehensive breakdown of the adjective "mad," which I think might be helpful:
