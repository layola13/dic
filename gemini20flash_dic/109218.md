After researching the word "leig," I couldn't find a standard English word with that spelling. It might be a misspelling, a term from a specialized field, or a word from another language. As a result, the JSON object above contains null values for most of the fields. If you have more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to provide a more accurate analysis.
