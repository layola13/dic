  "definition": "In economics, elasticities refer to the measure of how much an economic variable changes in response to a change in another variable. It is most commonly used to describe the change in quantity demanded or supplied in response to a change in price.",
  "example": "The elasticities of demand for luxury goods are generally higher than those for necessities.",
