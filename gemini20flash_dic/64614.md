  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "喷发性",
  "definition": "Eruptivity refers to the degree to which a volcano tends to erupt explosively. It is determined by the magma's gas content and viscosity. High eruptivity indicates a volcano is prone to violent eruptions, while low eruptivity suggests effusive eruptions.",
  "example": "The eruptivity of a volcano can change over time due to shifts in magma composition.",
  "synonyms": [
    "explosivity",
    "volcanic explosivity",
    "eruption intensity"
