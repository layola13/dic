Please provide the word that you would like me to analyze in the JSON format you specified. I need the `{rhs}` value to proceed. For example, if you want me to analyze the word "example," you would write:

```json
{
  "rhs": "example"
}
```

Once you provide the word, I will create a detailed JSON object including its phonetics, part of speech, translation, definition, example sentences, synonyms, antonyms, usage in different tenses, and common phrases.
