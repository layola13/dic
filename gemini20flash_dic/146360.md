  "part_of_speech": "noun, verb (gerund or present participle)",
  "translation": "过度拟合，过度修复",
  "definition": "The act of excessively optimizing or modifying something, often leading to unintended negative consequences or decreased overall performance. It is most often used within data science and machine learning when a model is trained too well on a specific dataset to the detriment of its ability to generalize and to accurately predict or classify new data points.  It can also refer to excessively repairing or modifying something, beyond what is necessary, often causing problems or damage.",
  "example": "Overfixing the model led to poor performance on the test data.",

    "overfitting",

    "overengineering"
