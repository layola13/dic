Garfish, also known simply as gar, are ray-finned fish that belong to the family Lepisosteidae. They are characterized by their long, slender bodies and elongated jaws filled with sharp teeth. These fish are often found in North and Central America, as well as some parts of Asia.

Garfish inhabit a variety of aquatic environments, including rivers, lakes, and swamps. They are known for their ability to tolerate a wide range of water conditions, including low oxygen levels. As ambush predators, they primarily feed on smaller fish and crustaceans.

While some species of garfish are consumed by humans, they are not typically considered a popular food fish. However, their unique appearance and evolutionary history have made them a subject of interest to scientists and anglers alike.
