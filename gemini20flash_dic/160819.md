  "definition": "This form is unusual and grammatically complex. It represents the possessive of 'possessedness' which is a noun describing the state of being possessed, often in an extreme way (e.g., by a spirit, idea, or emotion). The added 's indicates that something *belongs to* this state of possessedness. Due to its awkward construction and specialized meaning, this word is rarely used in common language.",
  "example": "The possessedness's grip on her mind was loosening after years of therapy. (Hypothetical - demonstrates the grammatical structure but would rarely be used). A more natural phrasing would be: The grip that possessedness had on her mind…",
  "synonyms": ["obsession's", "fixation's", "compulsion's"],

  "usage": {
    "general_notes": [
      "This word is highly uncommon and grammatically awkward. Consider rephrasing using a more natural sentence structure. For example, instead of 'the possessedness's influence,' try 'the influence of possessedness' or 'the influence that possessedness had.'",
      "The primary issue is that 'possessedness' is already a noun representing a state or quality, so possessing something *of* the possessedness is difficult to conceptualize clearly."

        "example": "The possessedness's intensity waned over time.",

       {
        "example": "The possessedness's consequences are still being felt.",
