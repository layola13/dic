  "definition": "Cubisms is the plural form of cubism, referring to specific instances, examples, or variations of the cubist art movement. Cubism was one of the most influential visual arts styles of the early twentieth century. It was created by Pablo Picasso (Spanish, 1881–1973) and Georges Braque (French, 1882–1963) in Paris between 1907 and 1914. The Cubist painters rejected the inherited concept that art should copy nature, or that they should adopt traditional techniques of perspective, modeling, and foreshortening. They wanted instead to emphasize the two-dimensionality of the canvas. So they reduced and fractured objects into geometrical forms, and then realigned these within a shallow, relieflike space. They also used multiple or contrasting vantage points.",
  "example": "The exhibition featured various cubisms, each showcasing a unique interpretation of the style.",
