I'll do my best to provide a comprehensive JSON format analysis of the word "spaky," similar to the example you provided for "what." However, it's worth noting that "spaky" doesn't appear to be a standard English word. It might be a misspelling, a slang term, or a word from a specific context or dialect. I will try to create a response based on the assumption it is related to "sparky" and is used informally.
