  "translation": "不整合",
  "definition": "A type of unconformity in which the beds above and below the erosional surface are parallel.",
  "example": "The geologist identified a disconformity in the rock layers, indicating a period of erosion between sedimentary deposits.",

  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "example": "Disconformities are often difficult to recognize because there is no angular discordance between the layers.",
        "translation": "不整合现象通常难以识别，因为各层之间没有角度不协调。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The presence of a disconformity suggests that the area was once exposed to erosion before being submerged again.",
        "translation": "不整合现象的存在表明该区域曾经暴露于侵蚀，然后再次被淹没。"

    "formation": [
      {
        "example": "Disconformities form when sedimentary layers are uplifted, eroded, and then submerged for new deposition.",
        "translation": "当沉积层隆起、侵蚀，然后淹没以进行新的沉积时，就会形成不整合现象。"
