I was unable to find enough information about the word "shuttlewise" to create a comprehensive JSON object as you requested. It may be a very new word, a technical term, or simply not widely documented. I can offer you a basic structure, but I won't be able to fill it with detailed definitions, examples, or usage scenarios:

```json
{
  "word": "shuttlewise",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": null,
  "translation": null,
  "definition": null,
  "example": null,
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {},
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [],
    "idioms": []
  }
}
```

If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to refine the search and provide a more useful result.
