I was unable to find a standard English word, "codriven," in common dictionaries or linguistic resources. It may be a compound word, a neologism, or a term specific to a particular field. As such, I will proceed with a hypothetical analysis, assuming it is related to code and driving.

Here is a potential JSON structure based on that assumption:
