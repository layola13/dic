I was unable to find an exact dictionary entry for "manapur." It is possible that this is a technical term, a proper noun, a misspelling, or a word in a language other than English.

To provide the JSON format you requested, I will use a placeholder definition with some common elements, but I will mark it as "Definition not found." Please note that without a real definition, the example sentences, synonyms, antonyms, and usage sections will be limited and potentially inaccurate.

```json

If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to provide a more accurate definition and expand on the other sections.
