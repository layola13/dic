  "definition": "A parfocal lens is a lens that maintains focus when magnification is changed. If a microscope or camera is equipped with parfocal lenses, it means that once the image is focused with one lens, you can switch to another lens and the image will remain in focus, or require only minimal refocusing.",
  "example": "Parfocal lenses are essential for efficient use of microscopes in research and clinical settings.",
