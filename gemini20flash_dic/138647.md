I will generate a JSON object containing a detailed analysis of the word "nudeness's," including its phonetics, part of speech, translation, definition, examples, synonyms, antonyms, usage, and common phrases. However, it is worth noting that "nudeness's" is quite an unusual form. "Nudeness" itself is a noun, and adding "'s" typically indicates possession or a contraction. In this case, it most likely refers to the possession of something by "nudeness." I will address this in the definition and examples.
