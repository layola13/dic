  "definition": "The screamers, also known as the Palamedeidae, are a small family of birds, which consists of three extant species in two genera, Chauna and Anhima. They are related to the Galliformes, but have evolved features superficially similar to those of waterfowl, and occur in open wetlands. The extant species all occur in South America. The relationships between the three species have been studied using morphology, vocalizations, and DNA. All studies confirm that the two species of Chauna, the southern screamer and the northern screamer, are each other's closest relatives, and that the horned screamer (Anhima cornuta) is the most basal species.",
