  "definition": "This is the possessive form of 'incorporatedness', which refers to the state or quality of being incorporated or integrated.  Since it's a double possessive, it's rarely used and grammatically awkward. It would imply something belonging to the 'incorporatedness' of something else.",
  "example": "The incorporatedness's definition is a bit complex.",

  "notes": [
    "This word is highly uncommon in its possessive form and should generally be avoided in favor of rephrasing.  The concept itself (incorporatedness) relates to the degree to which something is integrated or included within a larger whole.",
    "The possessive form 'incorporatedness's' suggests ownership or a relationship, which is abstract and difficult to define. Always consider rephrasing to express the intended meaning more clearly."
