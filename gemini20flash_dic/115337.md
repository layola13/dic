Based on my search, "mano" has a few different meanings depending on the context. In Spanish, it directly translates to "hand." However, it's also commonly used as a slang term to refer to a "brother" or "friend," similar to "bro" or "dude" in English. I've included examples of both usages in the JSON object above.
