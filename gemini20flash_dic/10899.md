  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "文石",
  "definition": "A carbonate mineral, one of the two common naturally occurring crystal forms of calcium carbonate, CaCO3 (the other being the mineral calcite). It is formed by biological and physical processes, most notably those involving marine organisms. Its crystal structure differs from that of calcite, resulting in a different crystal shape, an orthorhombic crystal system. Aragonite is less stable than calcite, and will alter to calcite over timescales of 107 to 108 years at temperatures under 300 °C.",
  "example": "Aragonite is often found in the shells of marine organisms and in cave formations.",
