  "definition": "In mathematics and logic, subcompletenesses refers to a property related to completeness, but specifically in the context of subsets or substructures. It often implies that a certain subset possesses characteristics of completeness within a larger structure, though not necessarily implying full completeness of the entire structure.",
  "example": "The subcompletenesses of this axiom system ensures certain properties within the defined subset.",

      {
        "example": "In the context of formal systems, analyzing the subcompletenesses of a subsystem helps to understand its independent properties.",
        "translation": "在形式系统的语境中，分析一个子系统的子完备性有助于理解其独立的属性。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The investigation of subcompletenesses is crucial in determining the limitations and capabilities of specific mathematical structures.",
