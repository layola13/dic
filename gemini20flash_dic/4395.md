  "phonetics": "/ˌæləmoʊˈdæləti/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "跨模态性; 超模态性",
  "definition": "The property of being independent of specific sensory modalities; information that is represented and processed in a way that is not tied to any particular sense (e.g., vision, hearing, touch). It refers to representations or processes that are abstract and can be accessed and manipulated across different sensory domains.",
  "example": "Concepts like 'number' and 'time' are thought to be represented in an alamodal format, allowing them to be understood and used regardless of whether they are presented visually, auditorily, or through other modalities.",
  "synonyms": [
    "multimodality",
    "cross-modality",
    "abstract representation"
  ],
  "antonyms": [
    "modality-specific",
    "unimodal"
  ],
  "usage": {
    "general_sentences": [
      {
        "sentence": "The research explores the alamodality of numerical cognition, investigating whether numerical concepts are tied to specific sensory experiences.",

      },
      {
        "sentence": "The theory suggests that abstract concepts are stored in an alamodal format in the brain.",
        "translation": "该理论认为，抽象概念以跨模态的形式存储在大脑中。"

      {
        "sentence": "Evidence for alamodality is often sought by examining how information learned in one modality transfers to another.",
        "translation": "跨模态性的证据通常通过检查在一种模态中学习的信息如何转移到另一种模态来寻找。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "Studies on amodal perception contribute to our understanding of alamodality in cognition.",
        "translation": "对非模态感知的研究有助于我们理解认知中的跨模态性。"

        "sentence": "Understanding how alamodality emerges in children can provide insights into the foundations of conceptual knowledge.",
