I'll do my best to provide a detailed JSON format analysis of the word "bsing," similar to the example you gave for "what." However, since "bsing" doesn't seem to be a standard English word, I'll have to rely on context clues and online resources to infer its possible meanings and usages. I will create some plausible examples based on common usage patterns.
