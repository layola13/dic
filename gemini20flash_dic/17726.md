I was unable to find an exact match for the word "beddy" in standard dictionaries. It may be a less common word, a misspelling, or a word used in a specific context that isn't widely documented. Therefore, I'm providing a general JSON format structure.

```json
{
  "word": "beddy",
  "phonetics": "unknown",
  "part_of_speech": "unknown",
  "translation": "unknown",
  "definition": "Definition not found in standard dictionaries. Please check the spelling or context.",
  "example": "Example not available due to lack of definition.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {},
  "phrases": {}
}
```
