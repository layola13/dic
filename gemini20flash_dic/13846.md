  "etymology": {
    "origin": "From the myth of the Augean stables, the stables of King Augeas that housed a huge number of cattle and had never been cleaned. Hercules was tasked with cleaning them as one of his twelve labors and accomplished the task by diverting two rivers through the stables.",
    "details": "The term 'Augean' is derived from the Greek myth of Hercules and the Augean Stables. King Augeas had an immense number of cattle, and their stables had never been cleaned, resulting in an overwhelming amount of manure. Hercules was assigned the task of cleaning these stables as one of his twelve labors. He accomplished this seemingly impossible task by diverting the courses of two rivers, causing them to flow through the stables and wash away the filth. This myth has led to 'Augean' being used to describe something extremely filthy or a task that requires immense effort to clean or rectify."
