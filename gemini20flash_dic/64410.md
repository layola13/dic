  "definition": "In linguistics, ergativity is a pattern of grammatical relations in which the subject of an intransitive verb is treated like the object of a transitive verb, and differently from the subject of a transitive verb.  Specifically, the intransitive subject and transitive object are marked in the same way (absolutive case), and the transitive subject is marked differently (ergative case).",
  "example": "Many languages, such as Basque and some Australian Aboriginal languages, exhibit ergativity.",
