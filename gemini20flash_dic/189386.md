  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "射囊",
  "definition": "A type of extrusive organelle or nematocyst found in some species of flatworms, particularly turbellarians. It is an elongated, sac-like structure that contains a tightly coiled thread or tubule which can be rapidly everted or discharged for adhesion or defense.",
  "example": "The turbellarian used its sagittocysts to attach itself to the substrate.",
