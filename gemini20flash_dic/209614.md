  "definition": "A property in mathematical logic, specifically in the context of proof systems or formal systems, where a subset of axioms or rules is sufficient to derive a particular set of theorems or formulas within the system. It suggests a form of completeness, but restricted to a specific subset or sub-theory within the larger system.",
