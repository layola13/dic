      {
        "sentence": "In chemistry, two molecules are superimposable if they are essentially the same, just oriented differently in space.",

        "translation": "虽然“identical”意味着完全相同，但“superimposable”特指完全重叠的能力。两个物体可以是相同的，因此是可重叠的，但术语“superimposable”强调的是空间关系。"

        "comparison": "Superimposable vs. Similar",

        "translation": "“Similar”对象共享特征，但不一定是相同的大小或形状。“Superimposable”对象的大小和形状完全相同，允许它们完美地重叠。"
