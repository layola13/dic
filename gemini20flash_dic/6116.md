  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "无变态发育",
  "definition": "A type of insect development in which the young are essentially smaller versions of the adults, and there is no distinct larval stage or metamorphosis. Growth occurs through molting.",
  "example": "Silverfish exhibit ametabolism, meaning the young nymphs resemble miniature adults.",
  "synonyms": [
    "direct development",
    "incomplete metamorphosis (sometimes used loosely, but more accurately refers to hemimetabolism)"
  ],
  "antonyms": [
    "metamorphosis",
    "holometabolism",
    "hemimetabolism"
  ],
  "usage": {
    "general_context": [
      {
        "sentence": "Ametabolism is a primitive form of insect development found in wingless insects.",
        "translation": "无变态发育是无翅昆虫中发现的一种原始的昆虫发育形式。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "In insects with ametabolism, the number of molts may continue throughout their adult life.",
        "translation": "在具有无变态发育的昆虫中，蜕皮的次数可能会持续到其成年生活。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "Ametabolism contrasts sharply with holometabolism, which involves a pupal stage.",
        "translation": "无变态发育与全变态发育形成鲜明对比，后者涉及蛹期。"
      }

    "technical_context": [
      {
        "sentence": "Understanding ametabolism is crucial for studying the evolutionary history of insect development.",
        "translation": "理解无变态发育对于研究昆虫发育的进化史至关重要。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "The absence of larval stages in ametabolism simplifies the developmental process.",
        "translation": "在无变态发育中，幼虫阶段的缺失简化了发育过程。"

        "sentence": "Researchers use ametabolism as a model to understand the basic principles of growth and molting in insects.",
