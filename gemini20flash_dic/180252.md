I was unable to find a complete, verified entry for the word "refragate" in standard dictionaries. It may be a less common word, a technical term from a specific field, a newly coined word, or possibly a misspelling. It is important to note that without standard dictionary information, the following analysis is speculative and based on potential word roots and patterns:
