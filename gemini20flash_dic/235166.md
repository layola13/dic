  "definition": "In the context of computer science, particularly in areas like compiler design or parsing, a 'uniselector' might refer to a mechanism or component that selects a single option or alternative from a set of possibilities. Without further context, it's difficult to provide a precise definition. The term isn't widely recognized in standard English dictionaries or technical documentation.",
