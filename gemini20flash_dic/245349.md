  "definition": "In computer graphics, especially in the context of video games or 3D modeling, 'vob' is often used informally or as a file extension associated with a 'voxel object'. A voxel object is a three-dimensional representation of an object using voxels, which are volumetric pixels. Think of them as 3D pixels.",
