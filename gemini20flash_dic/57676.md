I'll do my best to create a JSON object that thoroughly analyzes the word "drawing-roomy" in the format you've requested. However, it should be noted that "drawing-roomy" is not a standard or widely recognized English word. It's possible it could be a very niche or newly coined term. Because of this, some fields may be difficult to populate with definitive information.
