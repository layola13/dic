  "translation": "折射率 (refractiveness的复数形式)",
  "definition": "Plural form of refractiveness, which is the property of a material that determines how much light bends, or refracts, when entering it. It is a measure of the change in direction as light passes from one medium to another. Refractiveness is related to the speed of light in the material; higher refractiveness indicates a slower speed of light.",
  "example": "The refractivenesses of different types of glass vary, affecting the way they focus light.",
  "synonyms": ["refraction", "optical density", "index of refraction"],
