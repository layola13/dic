I've looked for the definition of "dodipoll", but unfortunately, this word doesn't appear to have a standard English definition. It might be a misspelling, a term from a specialized field, or a word from a less common dialect. I can, however, provide you with a JSON structure, but without the actual details for "dodipoll."
