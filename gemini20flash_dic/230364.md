I can generate a JSON object that describes the word "undelaying," but I need to clarify a few things first, as "undelaying" is not a commonly recognized English word. It seems to be the opposite of "delaying," which means not causing a delay or something that is happening without delay.

I will proceed with the following assumptions and structure:

*   **Word:** undelaying
*   **Phonetics:** Based on the likely pronunciation
*   **Part of Speech:** Adjective, Verb (present participle)
*   **Translation:** Non-delaying, Without delay
*   **Definition:** Not causing a delay; happening immediately or without postponement.
*   **Examples:** Provide example sentences to illustrate usage.
*   **Synonyms:** Immediate, Prompt, Swift.
*   **Antonyms:** Delaying, Hindering.
*   **Usage:** Show how the word might be used in different tenses and sentence structures. (This will be somewhat speculative due to the word's uncommon nature).
*   **Phrases:** Include possible phrases where "undelaying" might be used.

Here is the JSON formatted response:
