  "translation": "多头 (通常指在神经网络中使用的多头注意力机制)",
  "definition": "In the context of neural networks, particularly transformers, 'multiheads' refers to the multiple attention heads used in the multi-head attention mechanism.  Each 'head' performs a separate attention calculation, allowing the model to capture different aspects of the relationships between words in a sequence. This term is most commonly seen as part of 'multi-head attention'. It means having more than one 'attention head' performing the attention mechanism.",
  "example": "The transformer architecture uses multiheads to capture different relationships within the input sequence.",

    "multi-head attention",
    "multiple attention heads"

      {
        "example": "The model employs 8 multiheads to better understand the context.",

      },
      {
        "example": "Increasing the number of multiheads can improve the model's performance, but also increases computational cost.",

      {
        "example": "In the implementation, multiheads are computed in parallel to improve efficiency.",

      },
      {
        "example": "Each multihead learns different feature representations from the input.",

      {
        "example": "The use of multiheads allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.",
        "translation": "多头的使用允许模型同时关注输入序列的不同部分。"

      {
        "example": "Multiheads can be interpreted as capturing different types of dependencies between words.",
