Based on my search, a "dozener" is a person who practices dowsing, especially to find water. Dowsing is a technique used to locate underground water, minerals, or other hidden or lost substances by using a tool such as a forked stick or pendulum. People who practice dowsing are also known as diviners or water witches.
