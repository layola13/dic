  "definition": "Ooephoridium is a structure found in certain parasitic fungi, specifically within the Microsporidia group. It represents an early stage in the development of spores within the sporont. During sporogenesis, the ooephoridium gives rise to sporoblasts, which eventually mature into spores. The ooephoridium is essentially a developmental structure that plays a key role in the reproductive cycle of these parasites.",
  "example": "During the study of microsporidian development, the ooephoridium stage was identified as crucial for understanding spore formation.",
