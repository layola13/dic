I can certainly help with that! I noticed that the word you provided, "evomition," is not a real English word. Did you perhaps mean "evolution"? If so, I can provide a detailed breakdown in JSON format similar to the example you gave for "what."

However, since "evomition" is not a recognized word, I will create a JSON structure that indicates it was not found.

```json
{
  "word": "evomition",
  "error": "Word not found in dictionary.",
  "suggestion": "Did you mean 'evolution'?"
}
```

If you meant "evolution", here is the breakdown:
