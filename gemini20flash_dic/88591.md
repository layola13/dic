Based on my search, "hitri" does not seem to be a standard English word. Therefore, I am unable to provide detailed information, including its phonetics, part of speech, translation, definition, example sentences, synonyms, antonyms, usage in different tenses, and common phrases or idioms. The JSON above provides a template with null values to indicate the absence of information.
