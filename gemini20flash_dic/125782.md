  "translation": "紫脲酸铵",
  "definition": "Murexide is the common name for ammonium purpurate. It is the ammonium salt of purpuric acid. The compound is used as an indicator for complexometric titrations of calcium. Murexide is also used in analytical chemistry as a complexing agent. It has applications in diverse areas such as in the dyeing of textiles, and the determination of calcium content in mixtures.",
