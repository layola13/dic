I couldn’t find a direct translation or definition for the word "subah" in English. It's possible that "subah" is not an English word.

If "subah" is from another language, like Hindi or Urdu, it translates to "morning." In that context, here's a potential JSON format breakdown, keeping in mind that the part-of-speech and usage examples would differ from "what":

```json
{
  "word": "subah",
  "phonetics": "/suːbɑː/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "morning",
  "definition": "The early part of the day, from sunrise to noon.",
  "example": "I drink coffee every subah.",
  "synonyms": ["dawn", "sunrise", "morn"],
  "antonyms": ["evening", "night"],
  "usage": {
    "general_examples": [
      {
        "example": "The sun rises in the east every subah.",
        "translation": "太阳每天早上从东方升起。"
      },
      {
        "example": "I like to go for a walk in the subah.",
        "translation": "我喜欢早上散步。"
      }
    ],
    "time_expressions": [
      {
        "example": "Subah sawere",
        "translation": "Early in the morning"
      },
      {
        "example": "Har subah",
        "translation": "Every morning"
      }
    ]
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [
      {
        "phrase": "Subah bakhair",
        "translation": "Good morning (in Urdu)"
      }
    ],
    "idioms": [
      {
        "phrase": "Subah ka bhoola shaam ko ghar aaye to usse bhoola nahi kehte",
        "translation": "It’s never too late to mend one's ways (literal: if someone who got lost in the morning returns home in the evening, they are not considered lost)"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Please confirm the origin and meaning of "subah" if this is not accurate, so I can refine the JSON object.
