  "translation": "共同继承",
  "definition": "The simultaneous inheritance of two or more characteristics due to the genes for those traits being located close together on the same chromosome; also refers to a situation where multiple entities inherit from the same source.",
  "example": "In genetics, coinheritance can lead to the traits being expressed together in offspring. In object-oriented programming, coinheritance allows multiple classes to inherit properties and methods from a common parent class.",

    "linked inheritance",
    "joint inheritance",
    "multiple inheritance (in programming context)"

    "independent assortment",
    "separate inheritance"

      {
        "example": "The coinheritance of these genetic markers suggests they are located near each other on the chromosome.",
        "translation": "这些遗传标记的共同继承表明它们位于染色体上彼此靠近的位置。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Coinheritance in object-oriented design simplifies code reuse.",

      {
        "example": "Due to coinheritance, individuals with a specific disease also commonly exhibit another related trait.",

      },
      {
        "example": "The study focused on the coinheritance patterns of several linked genes.",

      {
        "example": "Coinheritance, also known as multiple inheritance, can sometimes lead to complex class hierarchies.",
