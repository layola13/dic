  "translation": "黑芥子苷",
  "definition": "A glucosinolate found in certain plants of the family Brassicaceae, such as black mustard, horseradish, and Brussels sprouts. When plant tissue containing sinigrin is crushed, this glucosinolate is enzymatically hydrolyzed by myrosinase to produce allyl isothiocyanate (mustard oil), which is responsible for the pungent taste of mustard.",
  "example": "Sinigrin is a natural compound that contributes to the flavor of mustard.",

    "general": [
      {
        "example": "The presence of sinigrin in black mustard seeds is responsible for their sharp taste.",
        "translation": "黑芥菜籽中黑芥子苷的存在是其味道辛辣的原因。"

      {
        "example": "Sinigrin can be extracted from horseradish root and used as a natural flavoring agent.",

      {
        "example": "When sinigrin comes into contact with myrosinase, it is broken down into allyl isothiocyanate, glucose, and other byproducts.",
