  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "磷光",
  "definition": "A type of photoluminescence related to fluorescence. Unlike fluorescence, a phosphorescent material does not immediately re-emit the radiation it absorbs. The slower time scales of the re-emission are associated with forbidden energy state transitions in quantum mechanics. More simply, it is light emitted by a substance without combustion or perceptible heat.",
  "example": "The phosphorescence of the decaying wood could be seen in the dark.",
  "synonyms": ["luminescence", "fluorescence", "glow"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "Phosphorescence is often observed in marine organisms.",

        "example": "The scientist studied the phosphorescence of the new material.",

        "example": "Phosphorescence occurs when a molecule returns to the ground state after being excited to a higher energy level.",
        "translation": "当分子被激发到更高的能级后返回到基态时，就会发生磷光现象。"
