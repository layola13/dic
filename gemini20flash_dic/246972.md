  "word": "wattless",
  "phonetics": "/ˈwɒtləs/",
  "part_of_speech": "adj.",
  "translation": "无功的",
  "definition": "Having zero reactive power; not consuming or producing reactive power.",
  "example": "A purely resistive circuit is considered wattless because it does not have any reactive power.",
  "synonyms": ["reactive-free", "powerless (in a reactive sense)"],
  "antonyms": ["reactive", "inductive", "capacitive"],
  "usage": {
    "general_context": [
      {
        "example": "In AC circuits, a wattless component indicates that the current and voltage are in phase, resulting in no net power consumption in the reactive component.",
        "translation": "在交流电路中，无功分量表示电流和电压是同相位的，因此在无功分量中没有净功率消耗。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Wattless current can circulate in a circuit without doing any useful work, but it can contribute to increased current flow and losses in the conductors.",
        "translation": "无功电流可以在电路中循环而不做任何有用的功，但它会导致电流增加和导体损耗。"
      }
    ],
    "technical_applications": [
      {
        "example": "The ideal resistor is a wattless component as it only dissipates real power.",
        "translation": "理想电阻是一个无功元件，因为它只消耗有功功率。"
      },
      {
        "example": "In power factor correction, the goal is to minimize the wattless component of the current to improve efficiency.",
        "translation": "在功率因数校正中，目标是最小化电流的无功分量以提高效率。"
      }
    ],
    "comparative_usage": [
      {
        "example": "A capacitor or inductor, when ideal, is considered a wattless element because it stores energy rather than dissipating it.",
        "translation": "电容器或电感器在理想状态下被认为是无功元件，因为它存储能量而不是消耗能量。"
      },
      {
        "example": "While a transformer isn't entirely wattless due to losses, it primarily deals with reactive power transfer.",
        "translation": "虽然变压器由于损耗并非完全无功，但它主要处理无功功率传输。"
