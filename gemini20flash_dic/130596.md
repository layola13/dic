  "definition": "Traits or features that do not serve a function or purpose in the survival or reproduction of an organism. They may be neutral byproducts of other characteristics or historical remnants.",
  "example": "The presence of a vestigial structure like the human appendix is considered a nonadaptation, as it no longer serves its original digestive function.",

      {
        "example": "The concept of nonadaptations is important in evolutionary biology to distinguish between traits that are beneficial, neutral, or even detrimental to an organism's fitness.",

      {
        "example": "While some features of an organism are clearly adaptations, others may be nonadaptations resulting from genetic drift or developmental constraints.",
        "translation": "虽然生物体的某些特征显然是适应性，但其他特征可能是由于遗传漂变或发育限制而导致的非适应性。"
