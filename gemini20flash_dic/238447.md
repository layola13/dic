  "translation": "暂无确切中文释义",
  "definition": "The term 'unrifer' does not appear in standard English dictionaries and seems to be either a typographical error, a neologism, or a very rarely used term. Without established usage, its precise meaning remains unclear. It is possible that it was intended to convey a negation or reversal of an attribute related to 'rifing' (arranging in a series or pattern), but this is purely speculative.",
  "example": "Due to the lack of standardized usage, a contextual example is not available. In a speculative context, one might encounter a sentence such as 'The process was deemed unrifer, lacking the expected parallel arrangement,' though this usage is hypothetical.",
