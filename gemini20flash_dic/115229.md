  "definition": "A manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point. More precisely, for each point of a manifold, there is a neighborhood of that point which is homeomorphic to a Euclidean space. In automotive engineering, a manifold is a pipe or chamber branching into several openings.",
  "example": "The study of manifolds is central to many areas of mathematics and physics.",
