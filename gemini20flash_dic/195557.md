  "translation": "半绒羽",
  "definition": "A type of feather that has a distinct rachis (shaft) with barbs that are plumaceous (fluffy) over the entire length, or at least over a large part, of the feather. Semiplumes are intermediate in structure between contour feathers and down feathers, providing both insulation and aerodynamic properties.",
  "example": "Semiplumes are important for thermal insulation in birds, particularly in colder climates.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "example": "The semiplumes of waterfowl are particularly dense, providing excellent insulation against cold water.",
        "translation": "水禽的半绒羽特别密集，能很好地隔绝冷水。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Unlike down feathers, semiplumes have a central rachis, giving them more structure.",
        "translation": "与绒羽不同，半绒羽有一个中央羽轴，使其具有更强的结构。"
      }

    "scientific": [
      {
        "example": "In avian anatomy, the distribution and structure of semiplumes are often studied to understand thermoregulation.",
        "translation": "在鸟类解剖学中，经常研究半绒羽的分布和结构，以了解体温调节。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Semiplumes contribute significantly to the overall plumage volume, aiding in buoyancy for aquatic birds.",
        "translation": "半绒羽对整体羽毛体积有显著贡献，有助于水禽的浮力。"
      }
    ],
    "comparative": [
      {
        "example": "Semiplumes are larger than down feathers but smaller and less stiff than contour feathers.",
        "translation": "半绒羽比绒羽大，但比廓羽小且不硬。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Compared to filoplumes, semiplumes have a more complex structure and a greater role in insulation.",
        "translation": "与丝状羽相比，半绒羽具有更复杂的结构，在绝缘方面发挥着更大的作用。"
