  "definition": "Pertaining to or characterized by a schistose structure, which is a type of metamorphic rock texture where platy minerals (like mica or chlorite) are aligned in a parallel or sub-parallel fashion, giving the rock a layered or foliated appearance. This structure allows the rock to be easily split into thin flakes or slabs.",
