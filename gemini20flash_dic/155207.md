  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "丙型球蛋白A (Protein G Sepharose A)",
  "definition": "Protein G Sepharose A (PGSA) is a widely used affinity chromatography resin for the purification of immunoglobulins, particularly IgG antibodies, from various sources. It is composed of recombinant Protein G, a bacterial surface protein with a high affinity for the Fc region of IgG molecules, immobilized on a Sepharose A matrix.",
  "example": "Protein G Sepharose A is used to purify antibodies from cell culture supernatants or serum samples.",
  "synonyms": ["Protein G Agarose", "IgG purification resin"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "description": "PGSA is used to selectively bind and isolate IgG antibodies from complex mixtures based on the strong interaction between Protein G and the Fc region of IgG.",
        "example": "The cell lysate was passed through a Protein G Sepharose A column to capture the IgG antibodies."
      },
      {
        "description": "PGSA can be used in immunoprecipitation experiments to isolate specific target proteins along with their interacting antibodies.",
        "example": "Protein G Sepharose A beads were used to pull down the protein complex with the specific antibody."
      }
    ],
    "specific_applications": [
      {
        "application": "Antibody purification",
        "description": "PGSA is widely used to purify monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies from cell culture supernatants, ascites fluid, or serum.",
        "example": "The antibody was purified from the hybridoma supernatant using a Protein G Sepharose A column."
      },
      {
        "application": "Immunoprecipitation",
        "description": "PGSA is used to capture antibody-antigen complexes in immunoprecipitation assays for downstream analysis.",
        "example": "The cell lysate was incubated with the antibody and then captured on Protein G Sepharose A beads for Western blotting."
      },
      {
        "application": "Affinity chromatography",
        "description": "PGSA serves as an affinity chromatography resin for the selective isolation of IgG antibodies.",
        "example": "Protein G Sepharose A chromatography is a common method for purifying antibodies from biological samples."
      }
    ],
    "technical_considerations": [
      {
        "consideration": "Binding capacity",
        "description": "The binding capacity of PGSA for IgG antibodies depends on the specific resin and the antibody subtype. It's important to choose a resin with sufficient binding capacity for the amount of antibody being purified.",
        "example": "The Protein G Sepharose A resin has a binding capacity of 20 mg of human IgG per milliliter of resin."
      },
      {
        "consideration": "Elution conditions",
        "description": "The elution of bound antibodies from PGSA typically involves the use of acidic buffers, such as glycine-HCl. The pH of the elution buffer needs to be optimized to ensure efficient antibody recovery without damaging the antibody.",
        "example": "The antibody was eluted from the Protein G Sepharose A column using glycine-HCl buffer at pH 2.7."
      },
      {
        "consideration": "Regeneration",
        "description": "PGSA can be regenerated and reused multiple times. Cleaning the resin after each use can help prevent carryover contamination.",
        "example": "After each purification, the Protein G Sepharose A column was washed with a regeneration buffer to remove any remaining contaminants."

**请注意：**

*   由于 "PGSA" 是一个专业术语（Protein G Sepharose A），其用法主要集中在生物化学和免疫学领域。因此，我主要从技术和应用的角度提供了例句和描述。
*   "PGSA" 没有常见的习语用法。
*   音标我无法确定，因为这不是一个常规的英文单词。
