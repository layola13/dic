      {
        "context": "Parageosynclinals are often compared to orthogeosynclines, which are deeper and located further from the continental shelf.",
        "example": "Unlike orthogeosynclines, parageosynclinals are typically associated with less intense tectonic activity."

      {
        "context": "The concept of parageosynclinals was developed in the mid-20th century as part of the broader geosynclinal theory.",
        "example": "Although the geosynclinal theory has been largely superseded by plate tectonics, the term parageosynclinal is still used to describe certain types of sedimentary basins."
