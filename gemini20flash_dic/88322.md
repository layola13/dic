I can certainly help you with that! However, I need to inform you that the word "hippinesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be the plural form of "hippiness," which is an informal noun referring to the state or quality of being a hippie, or someone associated with the hippie subculture of the 1960s. Given that, the information below is based on the definition of the root word "hippie" and its derived forms.
