  "definition": "Plural form of subcondensation. Subcondensation refers to a secondary or further stage of condensation, where something that has already undergone condensation is subjected to another round of condensation. This term is primarily used in scientific or technical contexts, such as physics, chemistry, or engineering, to describe processes involving multiple stages of phase transition from a gas to a liquid or solid.",
  "example": "The process involves initial condensation followed by subcondensations to achieve higher purity.",
