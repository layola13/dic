  "translation": "反硝化作用",
  "definition": "The process by which nitrates are reduced to gaseous nitrogen products, such as nitrogen gas (N2) or nitrous oxide (N2O). This process is carried out by certain bacteria in anaerobic conditions and results in the loss of nitrogen from the soil.",
  "example": "Denitrification is a key process in the nitrogen cycle, converting nitrates back into atmospheric nitrogen.",
  "synonyms": [
    "nitrate reduction",
    "nitrogen loss"
  ],
  "antonyms": [
    "nitrogen fixation",
    "nitrification"
  ],
  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "example": "Agricultural practices can influence the rate of denitrification in soil.",
        "translation": "农业实践会影响土壤中反硝化作用的速率。"

        "example": "Denitrification in wastewater treatment plants helps remove excess nitrogen from the water.",

      {
        "example": "While denitrification removes excess nitrogen, it can also produce nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas.",
        "translation": "虽然反硝化作用可以去除过量的氮，但它也会产生一氧化二氮，一种强效温室气体。"
