  "definition": "Dezincification is a type of corrosion that occurs in brass and other zinc alloys. It involves the selective removal of zinc from the alloy, leaving behind a porous, weaker structure composed primarily of the more noble metal (usually copper).",
  "example": "Dezincification can lead to the failure of brass fittings in plumbing systems.",

      {
        "example": "Dezincification is more likely to occur in brass alloys with a higher zinc content.",
