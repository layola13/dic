  "example": "Many plants exhibit protandry to promote cross-pollination.",

    "dichogamous (specifically referring to the timing of sexual organ maturity)",

    "protogynous (female parts mature first)"
  ],
  "usage": {
    "general_use": [
      {
        "example": "Protandric flowers ensure that pollen is available to other flowers before their own stigmas become receptive.",
