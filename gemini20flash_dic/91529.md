  "definition": "Relating to a type of jaw suspension in fishes where the hyomandibula (a bone in the hyoid arch) articulates with the neurocranium (braincase) and supports the jaw. This allows for greater jaw mobility and wider mouth opening.",
  "example": "Sharks typically exhibit hyostylic jaw suspension, which contributes to their efficient predatory feeding behavior.",

        "example": "Compared to amphistylic or autostylic suspensions, hyostylic jaws provide increased flexibility during prey capture.",
