  "definition": "The measure of the deviation of the frequencies of overtones from exact whole multiples of the fundamental frequency. In simpler terms, it's the degree to which the overtones of a sound (especially in instruments like pianos) are not perfect multiples of the fundamental tone.",
  "example": "The inharmonicity of a piano string affects its tuning and sound quality.",

  "antonyms": ["harmonicity"],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "Inharmonicity is an important factor in the sound of many musical instruments, particularly stringed instruments.",
        "translation": "非谐性是许多乐器声音的重要因素，尤其是弦乐器。"

        "example": "The design of a piano takes inharmonicity into account to achieve the desired tone.",
