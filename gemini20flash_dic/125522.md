  "definition": "A multiset (or bag) is a generalization of the concept of a set that, unlike a set, allows multiple instances for each of its elements. The number of instances given for each element is called the multiplicity of this element in the multiset.",
  "example": "Consider the multiset {a, a, b, b, b, c}, which is distinct from the set {a, b, c} because the multiset contains multiple instances of the elements a and b.",
