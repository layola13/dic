  "word": "superfiniteness",

  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "超穷性;超有穷性",
  "definition": "A concept in mathematics, specifically in set theory and logic, related to sets or collections that are 'larger' than finite sets but still have certain restrictive properties compared to infinite sets. It is used to describe sets that, while not finite, can be constructed or described in a way that limits their infiniteness.",
  "example": "The concept of superfiniteness is often discussed in the context of non-standard analysis and constructive mathematics.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": ["infiniteness", "unboundedness"],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "In set theory, superfiniteness is a property that lies between finiteness and infiniteness, providing a way to reason about collections that are 'not quite' infinite.",
        "translation": "在集合论中，超穷性是位于有限性和无限性之间的一个属性，提供了一种推理“不太”无限的集合的方法。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The study of superfinite sets has implications for the foundations of mathematics, particularly in areas dealing with constructive proofs and non-standard models.",
        "translation": "对超穷集的研究对数学基础有影响，尤其是在处理构造性证明和非标准模型的领域。"

      {
        "example": "When dealing with superfinite sets, classical mathematical tools may need to be adapted to account for the specific properties of these sets.",
        "translation": "在处理超穷集时，可能需要调整经典的数学工具，以适应这些集合的特定属性。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Superfiniteness can be related to the idea of 'potential infinity,' where a set is considered infinite only in a potential, rather than actual, sense.",
        "translation": "超穷性可能与“潜在的无限”的概念有关，其中一个集合仅在潜在的而不是实际的意义上被认为是无限的。"
      }

    "logical_context": [
      {
        "example": "In logic, superfiniteness might appear when considering the size of models or the complexity of proofs.",
        "translation": "在逻辑中，当考虑模型的大小或证明的复杂性时，可能会出现超穷性。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The concept helps in refining our understanding of what it means for a mathematical object to be 'constructively' defined or provable.",
        "translation": "这个概念有助于完善我们对数学对象被“构造性”定义或可证明的理解。"
