Ichthyornis, meaning "fish bird," was a genus of toothed seabird that lived during the Late Cretaceous period, around 93.5 to 83.5 million years ago. It is a significant fossil because it possesses a blend of avian and reptilian characteristics, offering invaluable insights into the evolutionary transition from dinosaurs to modern birds.

Ichthyornis was about the size of a modern pigeon, with a length of approximately 8 inches (20 cm). Its notable features included a toothed beak and relatively long wings. These birds were believed to be strong fliers, similar to modern-day terns and gulls. They inhabited coastal regions and likely fed on fish and other marine life.

Scientists continue to study Ichthyornis fossils to understand more about the evolution of birds, their flight capabilities, and their place in the ecosystem of the Late Cretaceous period.
