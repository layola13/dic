  "definition": "Kinesis refers to movement or motion. In biology, it often describes a non-directional response to a stimulus, where the rate of movement or activity depends on the intensity of the stimulus. 'Kinesis's' would typically refer to something belonging to or associated with kinesis, although it's not a commonly used form.",
  "example": "The kinesis's effects on animal behavior are significant.",

    "movement",
    "motion",
    "activity",
    "locomotion"

  "antonyms": [
    "stasis",

    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "The study of kinesis's role in animal migration is crucial for understanding ecological patterns.",

      {
        "example": "In behavioral ecology, kinesis's mechanisms are often compared with taxes to differentiate between random and directed movements.",
        "translation": "在行为生态学中，运动的机制通常与趋性进行比较，以区分随机运动和定向运动。"
      },
