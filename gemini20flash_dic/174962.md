  "definition": "Radiature is not a standard English word. It may be a technical term or a misspelling of 'radiance' or 'radiature'. Based on the possible root and context, it could refer to the measure of radiant energy emitted, reflected, transmitted, or received by a surface, per unit solid angle and per unit projected area. It is used to quantify the amount of light or electromagnetic radiation.",
