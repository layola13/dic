```json
{
  "word": "endend",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": null,
  "translation": null,
  "definition": null,
  "example": null,
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {},
  "phrases": {}
}
```

I am unable to find enough information to fully populate the JSON object for the word "endend". The fields have been set to null or empty.
