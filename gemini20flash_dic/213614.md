It's often associated with situations where firms or industries are operating beyond their efficient capacity or are achieving outputs that seem impossible under normal circumstances.",
  "example": "The concept of superoutput is used in data envelopment analysis (DEA) to evaluate the efficiency of decision-making units, where a super-efficient unit can produce superoutput.",
