  "definition": "In paleontology, an anaptychus refers to a single horny or calcareous plate believed to be an operculum (a sort of lid or cover) or a jaw element of an ammonoid (extinct group of marine cephalopod molluscs). It is found detached from the rest of the ammonoid shell in the fossil record.",
