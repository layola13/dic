  "definition": "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was a German polymath and philosopher who occupies a prominent place in the history of both mathematics and philosophy. He independently developed calculus alongside Isaac Newton, and his notation is the one in common use since then. He also made major contributions to physics and technology, and anticipated notions that surfaced much later in probability theory, topology, psychology, linguistics, and information science.",
