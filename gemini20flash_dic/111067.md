I'll do my best to provide a detailed JSON format analysis of the word "listeningless." However, it's worth noting that "listeningless" is not a standard English word. It is possible it is a newly coined term, a highly specific technical term, or simply a misspelling. I will proceed assuming it's a compound word formed from "listening" and "less," and provide a possible analysis based on that assumption.
