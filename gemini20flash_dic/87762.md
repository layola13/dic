I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a detailed breakdown of the word "hgv" in the same format as the example for "what". "HGV" is an abbreviation that stands for "Heavy Goods Vehicle," and is not a word that can be analyzed with the same linguistic depth. However, I can provide some basic information in a JSON format.
