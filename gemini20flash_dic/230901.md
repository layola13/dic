  "phonetics": "/ˌʌndərˈfɪtɪŋ/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "欠拟合",
  "definition": "In machine learning, underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data, leading to poor performance on both the training and test data.",
  "example": "Using a linear model to fit a highly non-linear dataset will result in underfitting.",
  "synonyms": [
    "low bias",
    "oversimplification"
  ],

    "overfitting",
    "high variance"
  ],
  "usage": {
    "general_examples": [
      {
        "sentence": "The model is underfitting the data because it has too few parameters.",
        "translation": "该模型欠拟合数据，因为它具有太少的参数。"

      {
        "sentence": "Underfitting can be addressed by increasing the complexity of the model.",

    "causes": [
      {
        "cause": "Insufficient training data",
        "explanation": "The model does not have enough data to learn the underlying patterns.",
        "example": "Training a complex model on a small dataset can lead to underfitting if the model cannot generalize well."

        "cause": "Model is too simple",
        "explanation": "The model lacks the capacity to capture the complexity of the data.",

        "cause": "Features are not representative",
