  "definition": "In the context of data compression, 'lossful' refers to a compression method where some data is lost in the process of making the file smaller. This is usually done to achieve a higher compression ratio, but it means the decompressed file is not exactly the same as the original.",
  "example": "MP3 is a lossful audio compression format.",
  "synonyms": ["irreversible", "destructive"],
  "antonyms": ["lossless"],
  "usage": {
    "general_examples": [
      {
        "sentence": "Lossful compression is commonly used for images and audio files to reduce file size.",
        "translation": "有损压缩常用于图像和音频文件，以减小文件大小。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "The advantage of lossful compression is the smaller file size, but the disadvantage is reduced quality.",
        "translation": "有损压缩的优点是文件较小，但缺点是质量降低。"

        "sentence": "In lossful video compression, some frames or details may be discarded to reduce the data rate.",

      {
        "sentence": "Unlike lossless compression, lossful compression cannot perfectly reconstruct the original data.",

      {
        "sentence": "Lossful methods are preferred when file size is more critical than preserving every detail.",
