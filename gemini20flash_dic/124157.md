I couldn’t find the word “mortmal” in any dictionaries or standard reference materials. It’s possible that it is a specialized term, a newly coined word, or simply a misspelling. If you have more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to provide a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, I can offer you a JSON format similar to the "what" example, but with placeholder information, assuming it's a noun. Please note that without knowing the actual meaning of "mortmal," this will be highly speculative.
