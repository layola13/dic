  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "逸度",
  "definition": "A thermodynamic property that measures the tendency of a substance to escape from a phase. It has the same units as pressure and is often described as an 'effective pressure' which replaces the actual pressure in accurate chemical calculations.",
  "example": "The fugacity of a gas is equal to the pressure only for an ideal gas.",
  "synonyms": ["activity", "escaping tendency"],
