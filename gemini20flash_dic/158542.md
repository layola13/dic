  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "多态性",
  "definition": "In object-oriented programming, polymorphism is the ability of a variable, function, or object to take on multiple forms. It allows objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way.",
  "example": "Polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes in a uniform way.",
  "synonyms": ["variability", "diversity"],
  "antonyms": ["monomorphism"],
  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "example": "Polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming, allowing for flexible and extensible code.",
        "translation": "多态性是面向对象编程中的一个关键概念，允许编写灵活和可扩展的代码。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Without polymorphism, you would need to write separate code for each type of object you want to handle.",
        "translation": "如果没有多态性，您需要为您想要处理的每种类型的对象编写单独的代码。"
      }
    ],
    "inheritance": [
      {
        "example": "Polymorphism is often achieved through inheritance, where subclasses can override methods of their parent class.",
        "translation": "多态性通常通过继承来实现，子类可以覆盖其父类的方法。"
      },
      {
        "example": "When a method is called on an object, the correct version of the method is determined at runtime based on the object's actual type.",
        "translation": "当在一个对象上调用一个方法时，该方法的正确版本在运行时根据对象的实际类型来确定。"
      }
    ],
    "interfaces": [
      {
        "example": "Interfaces can also be used to achieve polymorphism by defining a set of methods that multiple classes must implement.",
        "translation": "接口也可以通过定义多个类必须实现的一组方法来实现多态性。"
      },
      {
        "example": "This allows you to treat objects of different classes as if they were of the same type, as long as they implement the same interface.",
        "translation": "这允许您将不同类的对象视为同一类型，只要它们实现相同的接口。"
      }
    ],
    "method_overriding": [
      {
        "example": "Method overriding is a key aspect of polymorphism, allowing subclasses to provide their own implementation of a method inherited from a parent class.",
        "translation": "方法重写是多态性的一个关键方面，它允许子类提供从父类继承的方法的自己的实现。"
      },
      {
        "example": "This allows you to customize the behavior of objects based on their specific type.",
        "translation": "这允许您根据对象的特定类型自定义对象的行为。"

    ],
    "method_overloading": [
      {
        "example": "Method overloading is another form of polymorphism, where a class can have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.",
        "translation": "方法重载是多态性的另一种形式，其中一个类可以有多个同名但参数不同的方法。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The correct method to call is determined at compile time based on the arguments passed to the method.",
        "translation": "要调用的正确方法在编译时根据传递给该方法的参数来确定。"
