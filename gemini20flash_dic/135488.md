  "definition": "Non-philosophy is a philosophical approach developed by François Laruelle. It seeks to operate 'outside' or 'before' philosophy, not by negating philosophy, but by bracketing its internal decision-making processes. It aims to provide a generic, non-philosophical understanding of the real that is prior to philosophical categories and distinctions.",
  "example": "Laruelle's nonphilosophy attempts to create a science of philosophy by extracting philosophy's constants and developing them independently of philosophical decision.",
