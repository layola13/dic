  "definition": "Ekaboron is a placeholder name used by Dmitri Mendeleev for an undiscovered element with one more proton than boron (atomic number 5). Mendeleev used prefixes like 'eka-' (Sanskrit for 'one') to predict the properties of elements that would fill gaps in his periodic table. Ekaboron was predicted to be directly below boron in the periodic table. The element now known as scandium (atomic number 21) was identified as ekaboron when it was discovered in 1879.",
