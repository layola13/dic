I couldn't find a standard dictionary entry for "overchafe." It is possible that "overchafe" is a less common word, a technical term used in a specific field, a newly coined word, or perhaps a misspelling. However, I can try to provide a possible analysis based on its components: "over-" and "chafe."

Based on this, I've created a possible JSON structure for you.
