  "word": "nonflakilyness's",
  "phonetics": "N/A",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "某种事物或状态的非片状或稳定一致的性质的（所有格）",
  "definition": "This word appears to be a constructed term, likely used in a technical or specialized context. It is the possessive form of 'nonflakilyness,' which itself is derived from 'nonflaky.' 'Nonflaky' describes something that is consistent, reliable, and does not easily break apart or flake. Therefore, 'nonflakilyness' refers to the quality or state of being non-flaky, reliable, and consistent. The 's' at the end indicates possession.",
