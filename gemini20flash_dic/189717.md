  "phonetics": "/sælˈteɪʃən/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "跳跃, 跃迁, 突变",
  "definition": "Saltation refers to a sudden jump or abrupt change. It has different meanings across various fields:",
  "fields": {
    "geology": {
      "definition": "In geology, saltation describes the process where particles are transported by a fluid (usually wind or water) by bouncing along a surface. The particles are lifted for a short distance, carried by the fluid, and then fall back to the surface, dislodging other particles in the process.",
      "example": "Sand grains moving across a desert floor by bouncing in the wind is an example of saltation.",
      "related_terms": ["aeolian transport", "bedload", "suspension"]
    },
    "biology": {
      "definition": "In biology, saltation refers to a sudden and discontinuous evolutionary change. It suggests that new species or significant variations can arise in a single generation due to large-scale mutations, rather than gradual accumulation of small changes.",
      "example": "The idea that a major evolutionary change could occur in a single step, rather than through gradual adaptation, is an example of saltation.",
      "related_terms": ["mutation", "evolution", "punctuated equilibrium"]
    },
    "general_use": {
      "definition": "More generally, saltation can refer to any sudden or abrupt change or transition.",
      "example": "The company experienced a saltation in profits after the new marketing campaign.",
