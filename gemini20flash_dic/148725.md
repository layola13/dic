I couldn't find a direct entry for "overtrap" as a standard English word in the dictionaries and resources I consulted. It's possible this is a very specialized term, a newly coined word, or perhaps a typo.

However, I can offer a potential analysis based on its components: "over-" and "trap."

*   **Over-**: This prefix generally indicates excess, being above or beyond, or doing something excessively.
*   **Trap**: A device or situation designed to catch someone or something, often unexpectedly.

With that in mind, a speculative definition could be:
