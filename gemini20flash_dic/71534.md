The term "flappers" refers to young women in the 1920s who challenged traditional social norms with their modern and somewhat rebellious behavior, fashion choices, and lifestyle. Flappers were known for their bobbed hair, shorter hemlines on dresses, love of jazz music and dancing, and rejection of conventional expectations for women.
