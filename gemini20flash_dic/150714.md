  "definition": "A paraboloid is a three-dimensional shape formed by rotating a parabola around its axis of symmetry. It is a type of quadric surface, characterized by having parabolic cross-sections in two orthogonal directions.",
  "example": "The radio telescope dish was constructed in the shape of a paraboloid to focus incoming radio waves.",

      {
        "description": "In mathematics, paraboloids are studied in analytic geometry and calculus. They are described by quadratic equations.",
        "example": "The equation z = x^2 + y^2 represents an elliptic paraboloid."
      },
      {
        "description": "Paraboloids can be classified into elliptic paraboloids and hyperbolic paraboloids based on the shape of their cross-sections.",
        "example": "A hyperbolic paraboloid has the equation z = x^2 - y^2 and is characterized by having a saddle shape."
