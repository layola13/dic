I'm sorry, but I couldn't find enough reliable information about the word "gsman" to create a detailed JSON object as you requested. It may be a highly specialized term, a very new word, or possibly a typo. I can, however, offer some general information on how such a JSON object would be structured if the word were known:

```json
{
  "word": "gsman",
  "phonetics": "",
  "part_of_speech": "",
  "translation": "",
  "definition": "",
  "example": "",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [],
    "present_continuous": [],
    "present_perfect": [],
    "present_perfect_continuous": [],

    "past_continuous": [],
    "past_perfect": [],
    "past_perfect_continuous": [],
    "simple_future": [],
    "future_continuous": [],
    "future_perfect": [],
    "future_perfect_continuous": [],
    "subjunctive_mood": [],
    "passive_voice": [],
    "interrogative_sentences": [],
    "negative_sentences": []
  },
  "phrases": {

    "idioms": []

}
```

If you can provide more context about the word "gsman," such as its origin or field of use, I might be able to provide a more complete analysis.
