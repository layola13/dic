  "etymology": {
    "origin": "Middle English",
    "details": "The word 'niggard' comes from the Middle English word 'nigard,' which is likely derived from the Old Norse word 'hnøggr,' meaning stingy. The word is unrelated to any racial slur, though it is sometimes mistakenly perceived as such due to its phonetic similarity to a different word."
  },
  "note": "It is important to note that while 'niggard' itself has no etymological connection to any racial slurs, its phonetic similarity to such terms can cause offense. Therefore, it's advisable to use the word with caution, being aware of potential sensitivities and misunderstandings. In many contexts, using synonyms like 'miser' or 'cheapskate' can help avoid unintended offense."
