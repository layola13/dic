  "etymology": {
    "origin": "The term 'scot-free' originates from the Old English word 'scot,' referring to a tax or payment. 'Scot-free' literally meant 'free from tax' or 'without payment.' Over time, its meaning evolved to denote freedom from any kind of penalty or harm.",
    "historical_context": "In medieval England, 'scot' was a common term for various forms of tax or dues. To be 'scot-free' was a desirable state, indicating one had fulfilled their obligations and was thus exempt from further payments or penalties. The phrase gradually broadened to encompass any situation where someone avoids consequences."
