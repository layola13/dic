  "translation": "不整合 (地质学)",
  "definition": "Surfaces that represent missing rock strata or time in the geologic record. They are buried erosional surfaces separating two bodies of rock of different ages, indicating that sediment deposition was not continuous. Anticonformities imply uplift and erosion occurred prior to subsequent deposition.",
  "example": "The presence of anticonformities in sedimentary rock layers suggests significant geological events in the past.",
  "synonyms": ["unconformities", "erosional surfaces", "stratigraphic breaks"],
  "antonyms": ["conformities", "continuous deposition"],
  "usage": {
    "general": [

      {
        "example": "Anticonformities can be indicative of major geological events such as mountain building or sea-level changes.",
