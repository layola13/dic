Please provide the word you would like me to analyze in the JSON format you specified. I need the `{purfile}` to be replaced with the actual word. For example, if you want me to analyze the word "example," the request should look like this:

```json
请按以下单词'what"格式详细解析英文单词{example}，(注意，必须是返回JSON格式)
```

Once you provide the word, I will create a detailed JSON object containing the word's phonetics, part of speech, translation, definition, example usages in different tenses, synonyms, antonyms (if applicable), and common phrases/idioms.
