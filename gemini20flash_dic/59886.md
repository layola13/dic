  "definition": "Edams are a type of semi-hard cheese that originated in the Netherlands, specifically from the town of Edam. It is traditionally made from cow's milk and has a pale yellow interior with a red paraffin wax coating. Edam cheese is known for its mild, slightly nutty flavor that becomes more pronounced as it ages. Because of its good keeping qualities, Edam has historically been a popular cheese for export and is enjoyed worldwide. Edam is often consumed on its own, in sandwiches, or grated over dishes.  The word 'edams' is simply the plural form of 'Edam,' referring to multiple wheels or portions of the cheese.",
