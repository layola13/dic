  "definition": "In mathematics, specifically in the context of linear algebra and matrix theory, a hyperinvolution is a generalization of the concept of an involution. An involution is a linear transformation that, when applied twice, results in the original transformation (i.e., it is its own inverse). A hyperinvolution extends this idea, often involving higher powers or more complex algebraic structures.",
  "example": "The matrix A is a hyperinvolution if A^n = I for some integer n > 2, where I is the identity matrix.",
