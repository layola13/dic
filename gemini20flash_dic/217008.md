  "translation": "点击惩罚",
  "definition": "In the context of DNS (Domain Name System), a tap-penalty refers to a penalty applied to DNS resolvers (servers) that are considered 'taps' or intermediaries that passively observe DNS traffic without directly participating in the resolution process. These taps might be used for monitoring or data collection purposes.",
  "example": "The proposed DNS privacy protocol includes measures to discourage tap-penalties, ensuring resolvers are not penalized for passive observation.",

    "general_usage": [
      {
        "context": "DNS Privacy Protocols",
        "example": "Implementing DNS encryption protocols aims to reduce the risk of tap-penalties by making it harder for intermediaries to passively monitor DNS queries.",
        "translation": "实施DNS加密协议旨在降低点击惩罚的风险，因为它使中介机构更难以被动地监控DNS查询。"

      {
        "context": "Network Monitoring",
        "example": "While network monitoring is essential, imposing tap-penalties ensures that such monitoring does not negatively impact the performance of DNS resolvers.",
        "translation": "虽然网络监控至关重要，但实施点击惩罚可确保此类监控不会对DNS解析器的性能产生负面影响。"
