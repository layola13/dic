Please provide the word you want me to analyze in JSON format, replacing `{beeped}` with the actual word. For example:

```json
{
  "word": "example"
}
```

Once you provide the word, I will generate a detailed JSON object similar to the "what" example, including phonetics, part of speech, translation, definition, examples, synonyms, antonyms, usage in different tenses, and common phrases/idioms.
