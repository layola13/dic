I'll do my best to provide a comprehensive breakdown of the word "outsnoring" in JSON format, similar to the example you provided for "what". However, it's important to note that "outsnoring" is not a standard or widely recognized English word. It is likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a creative formation. Therefore, the information I can provide will be based on its likely structure and potential usage.
