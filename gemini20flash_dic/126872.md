  "notes": "This word is not standard English and is likely a non-standard derivation of 'nappy' (meaning diaper in British English) or related to the feeling of being 'nappy' (drowsy). It is best to confirm its intended meaning with the user of the word or in the context where it is used. If it is meant to relate to diapers, 'nappy's' might have been intended as possessive."
