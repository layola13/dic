  "translation": "终结器，结束器（在计算机编程中，特别是垃圾回收机制中，用来清理对象占用的资源）",
  "definition": "In computer programming, especially in garbage collection, a finalizer is a method that is automatically called by the garbage collector before an object is reclaimed. It is used to release resources held by the object that the garbage collector would not otherwise be able to release.",
  "example": "The finalizer ensures that the file handle is closed when the object is no longer needed.",
  "synonyms": ["destructor (in some languages)", "cleanup method"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general_use": [
      { "example": "Using finalizers should be avoided when possible, as they can impact garbage collection performance.", "translation": "应尽可能避免使用终结器，因为它们会影响垃圾回收的性能。" },
      { "example": "The finalizer provides a last chance to release unmanaged resources.", "translation": "终结器提供了释放非托管资源的最后机会。" }
    ],
    "garbage_collection": [
      { "example": "The garbage collector invokes the finalizer method for eligible objects.", "translation": "垃圾回收器为符合条件的对象调用终结器方法。" },
      { "example": "After an object has been finalized, it can be collected during the next garbage collection cycle.", "translation": "对象被终结后，可以在下一个垃圾回收周期中被回收。" }
    ],
    "resource_management": [
      { "example": "Finalizers are commonly used to dispose of resources like file handles and network connections.", "translation": "终结器通常用于处理诸如文件句柄和网络连接之类的资源。" },
      { "example": "Care must be taken when writing finalizers to avoid circular dependencies and resource leaks.", "translation": "在编写终结器时必须小心，以避免循环依赖和资源泄漏。" }
    ],
    "best_practices": [
      { "example": "It is generally better to implement the IDisposable interface and use a 'using' statement than relying on a finalizer.", "translation": "通常最好实现IDisposable接口并使用“using”语句，而不是依赖于终结器。" },
      { "example": "Finalizers should be lightweight and avoid complex operations.", "translation": "终结器应轻量级，并避免复杂的操作。" }
