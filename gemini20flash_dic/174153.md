I was unable to find a direct match for the word "queck" in the dictionaries and resources I consulted. It's possible that "queck" is a very rare word, a technical term, a regionalism, or even a misspelling.

I can, however, provide you with the JSON format you requested, but with placeholder data, assuming "queck" is a hypothetical word:

```json
{
  "word": "queck",
  "phonetics": "/kwɛk/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "未定义",
  "definition": "This word is not found in standard dictionaries. Assuming a hypothetical meaning.",
  "example": "I don't know what is a queck.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [
      {
        "question": "What is a queck?",
        "translation": "什么是queck？"
      }
    ],
    "present_continuous": [
      {
        "question": "What are you quecking?",
        "translation": "你在quecking什么？"
      }
    ],
    "simple_past": [
      {
        "question": "What did you queck yesterday?",
        "translation": "你昨天quecked什么？"
      }
    ],
    "simple_future": [
      {
        "question": "What will you queck tomorrow?",
        "translation": "你明天会queck什么？"
      }
    ]
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [
      {
        "phrase": "Queck out!",
        "translation": "小心！"
      }
    ],
    "idioms": [
      {
        "phrase": "quick as a queck",
        "translation": "像queck一样快"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

**Note:**

*   Since I couldn't find a real definition, the translations, examples, synonyms, antonyms, and usage examples are all hypothetical and based on common English sentence structures.
*   The phonetic transcription is a guess based on how the word *might* be pronounced.
