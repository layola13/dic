  "word": "approximants",
  "phonetics": "/əˈprɒksɪmənts/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "近音",
  "definition": "Speech sounds that are similar to vowels but function as consonants. Approximants are produced with a relatively open vocal tract, allowing air to pass through with minimal obstruction, resulting in a smooth, flowing sound.",
  "example": "The sounds /r/, /l/, /w/, and /j/ are examples of approximants in English.",
  "synonyms": ["glides", "liquids", "semi-vowels"],
  "antonyms": ["obstruents (e.g., stops, fricatives, affricates)"],
  "usage": {
    "general_examples": [
      {
        "sentence": "In phonetics, approximants are a class of consonants that are produced with a narrow constriction of the vocal tract, but not so narrow as to cause friction.",
        "translation": "在语音学中，近音是一类辅音，产生时声道有狭窄的收缩，但又不像摩擦音那样窄，不会引起摩擦。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "English has several approximants, including the /l/ in 'light,' the /r/ in 'right,' the /w/ in 'wet,' and the /j/ in 'yes.'",
        "translation": "英语有几个近音，包括“light”中的 /l/，“right”中的 /r/，“wet”中的 /w/ 和 “yes” 中的 /j/。"

      {
        "sentence": "Approximants are sometimes also referred to as semi-vowels or glides because their articulation is similar to that of vowels.",
        "translation": "近音有时也被称为半元音或滑音，因为它们的发音类似于元音。"

      {
        "sentence": "The acoustic properties of approximants lie between those of vowels and obstruents.",

      {
        "sentence": "Unlike fricatives, which produce turbulent airflow and hissing sounds, approximants involve a smoother, more laminar airflow.",
        "translation": "与产生湍流和嘶嘶声的摩擦音不同，近音涉及更平滑、更层流的气流。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "Compared to vowels, approximants are shorter in duration and less sonorous.",
