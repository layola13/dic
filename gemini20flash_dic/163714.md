Please provide the word you would like me to analyze in the JSON format you specified. I need the `{predefaults}` value to proceed. For example:

```json
{
  "word": "example_word"
}
```

Once you provide the word, I will generate a detailed JSON object with the word's phonetics, part of speech, translation, definition, example usages in different tenses, synonyms, antonyms (if applicable), common phrases, and idioms.
