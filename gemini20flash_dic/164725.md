  "definition": "In sound engineering and audio production, 'prefades' typically refers to audio signals or channels that are processed or adjusted before the main fader or volume control. This allows for specific elements of the sound to be tweaked or controlled independently before they are mixed into the overall sound output. It can also refer to a type of audio effect where the sound gradually fades in or out before the main sound event.",
  "example": "The engineer adjusted the prefades on the vocal track to ensure it sat perfectly in the mix before bringing up the main fader.",
  "synonyms": ["pre-fader sends", "pre-fader aux sends"],
  "antonyms": ["postfades"],
