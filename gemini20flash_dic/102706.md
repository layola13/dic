I was unable to find enough information about the word "jangam" to create a comprehensive JSON object like the example you provided for "what." It is possible that "jangam" is a proper noun, a technical term, a word in a language other than English, or a less common word.  I can offer you a basic JSON structure with limited information based on the data I could access.

```json
{
  "word": "jangam",
  "phonetics": "Unable to find standard phonetics.",
  "part_of_speech": "Uncertain, needs further context.",
  "translation": "Unable to provide a definitive translation without further context.",
  "definition": "Definition is unavailable without additional context.",
  "example": "Example sentence is unavailable without additional context.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {},
  "phrases": {}
}
```

To get a more complete entry, please provide context for the word "jangam." Knowing the field it's used in, its language of origin, or any other relevant information would help me to create a more accurate and detailed response.
