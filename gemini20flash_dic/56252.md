I am sorry, but I could not find the definition or usage examples for the word "dogate." It is possible that this word is not a recognized English word, is a very new or technical term not yet widely documented, or is a proper noun (like a name) that is not typically included in dictionaries.

I can, however, provide you with the JSON format as you requested, but with limited information.

```json
{
  "word": "dogate",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": null,
  "translation": null,
  "definition": "Definition not found.",
  "example": "Example not found.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {},
  "phrases": {}
}
```

If you have more information about the context in which you encountered this word, it might help me to provide a more accurate analysis. For example, is it used in a specific field, or is it part of a particular dialect or jargon?
