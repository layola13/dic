  "word": "ashamednesses",
  "phonetics": "No standard phonetic transcription available as it's a rare and non-standard word.",
  "part_of_speech": "Noun (though highly unusual and likely incorrect)",
  "translation": "No direct standard translation exists, but it would theoretically mean 'states of being ashamed' or 'instances of feeling ashamed'.",
  "definition": "This word is not recognized in standard dictionaries. If it were to follow standard English morphology, it would be the plural form of an abstract noun 'ashamedness,' referring to the state or quality of being ashamed. However, 'ashamedness' itself is very rare, and its pluralization is highly unusual and not recommended.",
  "example": "Usage of 'ashamednesses' is highly unconventional. A more appropriate phrasing would be 'instances of feeling ashamed' or rephrasing the sentence to avoid the need for such a word.",

        "note": "The word 'ashamednesses' is not standard English. It's formed by pluralizing the non-standard noun 'ashamedness,' which is derived from the adjective 'ashamed.' This kind of construction is extremely rare and generally not considered grammatically correct in modern English.",
