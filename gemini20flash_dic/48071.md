  "definition": "In programming, a declarator is the part of a declaration that specifies the name and type of a variable, function, or other entity.",
  "example": "In the C declaration 'int x;', 'x' is the declarator.",
  "synonyms": ["identifier", "name"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "context": "In C and C++, a declarator is a component of a declaration that introduces one or more identifiers. It includes the identifier being declared, and may also include type qualifiers, pointers, arrays, and function specifiers.",
        "example": "For example, in 'int *ptr;', '*ptr' is the declarator, indicating that 'ptr' is a pointer to an integer."
      },
      {
        "context": "Declarators specify how to interpret an identifier, providing essential information for the compiler to allocate memory and perform type checking.",
        "example": "The declarator 'int arr[10];' tells the compiler that 'arr' is an array of 10 integers."
      }
    ],
    "pointers": [
      {
        "context": "When declaring pointers, the '*' symbol is part of the declarator, indicating that the variable holds a memory address.",
        "example": "In 'int *p;', '*p' is the declarator, meaning 'p' is a pointer to an integer."
      },
      {
        "context": "Multiple levels of indirection can be specified using multiple '*' symbols in the declarator.",
        "example": "In 'int **pp;', '**pp' is the declarator, indicating 'pp' is a pointer to a pointer to an integer."
      }
    ],
    "arrays": [
      {
        "context": "Array declarators include square brackets '[]' to specify the size of the array.",
        "example": "The declaration 'int arr[5];' uses 'arr[5]' as the declarator, defining an array named 'arr' that can hold 5 integers."
      },
      {
        "context": "Multi-dimensional arrays use multiple sets of square brackets in the declarator.",
        "example": "In 'int matrix[3][4];', 'matrix[3][4]' is the declarator, representing a 2D array with 3 rows and 4 columns."
      }
    ],
    "functions": [
      {
        "context": "Function declarators include parentheses '()' to specify the function's parameter list.",
        "example": "In 'int func(int a, int b);', 'func(int a, int b)' is the declarator, defining a function named 'func' that takes two integer arguments."
      },
      {
        "context": "The declarator for a function pointer includes parentheses and the '*' symbol to indicate it is a pointer to a function.",
        "example": "In 'int (*func_ptr)(int);', '(*func_ptr)(int)' is the declarator, defining a pointer to a function that takes an integer argument and returns an integer."
      }
    ],
    "type_qualifiers": [
      {
        "context": "Type qualifiers such as 'const' and 'volatile' can be included in the declarator to specify additional properties of the variable.",
        "example": "In 'const int x = 10;', 'x' is the declarator, and 'const' indicates that the value of 'x' cannot be changed after initialization."
      },
      {
        "context": "The 'volatile' qualifier in the declarator indicates that the variable's value may be changed by external factors, requiring special handling by the compiler.",
        "example": "In 'volatile int sensor_data;', 'sensor_data' is the declarator, and 'volatile' indicates that the value of 'sensor_data' can change asynchronously."
