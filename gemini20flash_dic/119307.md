  "translation": "微环礁",
  "definition": "A microatoll is a colony of coral, usually a few meters in diameter, that is dead on top but still living around its edges. The living part forms a raised rim around the dead center. They are formed in shallow intertidal reef environments. The top surface of the coral is killed when exposed to air during very low tides. Because corals grow fastest upwards, the living rim is always trying to grow to sea level.",
  "example": "Microatolls provide valuable information about sea-level changes and past earthquakes.",
