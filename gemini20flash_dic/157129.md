I'll do my best to create a JSON object with details for the word "pinchfist," mirroring the structure you provided for "what." However, "pinchfist" doesn't appear to be a standard English word. It might be a made-up word, a slang term, or a term specific to a particular context.

Given that, I'll create an entry based on a potential interpretation of what the word might mean, assuming it combines the actions of "pinching" and making a "fist." I will mark the unknown elements accordingly.
