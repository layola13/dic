**Explanation of the fields, given the uncertainty:**

*   **word:** "hoyman" - The input word.
*   **phonetics:**  /ˈhɔɪmən/ - A likely phonetic transcription (pronunciation).
*   **part\_of\_speech:** "noun (assumed)" -  Since it often appears as a name, I assume it's a noun.
*   **translation:** "Potentially a surname or a made-up word; meaning unclear without context." - Acknowledges the lack of a standard definition.
*   **definition:** "Likely a surname. Without further context, a precise definition cannot be provided. Could be a neologism (newly coined word) or a specialized term." - Explains the uncertainty and possible interpretations.
*   **example:** "Mr. Hoyman is the new CEO." - A typical usage as a surname.
*   **synonyms:** \[ ] -  Empty, as there are no direct synonyms without a defined meaning.
*   **antonyms:** \[ ] - Empty, as there are no direct antonyms without a defined meaning.
*   **usage:**  Provides example sentences in various tenses, but these are very general due to the lack of a specific meaning for "hoyman."
*   **phrases:** Includes a placeholder example phrase.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Context is Key:** If "hoyman" has a specific meaning in a particular field (e.g., a company name, a technical term), the definition and usage examples would need to be adjusted accordingly.
*   **Neologism:** It's possible the word is newly invented. In that case, its meaning would depend on who created it and how they use it.
*   **Surname:** If "hoyman" is a real surname, its origin would be related to family history rather than a standard English definition.

If you can provide more context about where you encountered the word "hoyman," I may be able to refine this JSON object to be more accurate and helpful.
