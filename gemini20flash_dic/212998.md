I'll do my best to provide a detailed breakdown of "superextremest" in JSON format. This word appears to be a made-up superlative, combining "super" and "extreme" with the "-est" suffix. As such, a direct dictionary definition is unavailable, so I'll create an analysis based on its likely intended meaning.
