  "translation": "多例模式",
  "definition": "A design pattern that restricts the number of instances of a class to a specific quantity. It ensures that only a fixed number of instances exist and provides a way to access them.",
  "example": "The multiton pattern is useful when you need to manage a limited number of resources, such as database connections or printer instances.",

  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "example": "Using a multiton, you can ensure that only a predefined number of instances of a class are created, controlling resource usage.",
        "translation": "使用多例模式，你可以确保只创建预定义数量的类实例，从而控制资源使用。"

        "example": "Multiton pattern is often used in scenarios where you want to limit the number of connections to a server.",

      {
        "example": "In the implementation of a multiton, a map or dictionary typically stores the instances, and a key is used to access each instance.",

        "example": "Multiton provides flexibility compared to singleton, as it allows more than one instance while still limiting the total number.",
