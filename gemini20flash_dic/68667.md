While "farantly" is not a standard English word, I have provided an analysis based on the assumption that it is a misspelling and is intended to mean something similar to "apparently" or "probably."  The JSON above includes a possible phonetic transcription (if it were a real word), part of speech, translation, definition, example usages in various tenses, and common phrases.
