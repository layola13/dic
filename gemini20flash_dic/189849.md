I couldn’t find an exact match for the word "samatra" in the dictionaries and linguistic resources I consulted. It’s possible that it might be a proper noun, a term from a specialized field, a less common word, or even a misspelling. I will, however, provide a detailed JSON format analysis based on the structure you provided for "what," but with the understanding that some fields may remain empty or contain general information.
