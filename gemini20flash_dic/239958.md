I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a detailed breakdown and JSON format for the word "unstormiest" in the same way that you provided for "what." This is because "unstormiest" is not a standard or commonly recognized English word. It would be considered a constructed word, likely the superlative form of "unstormy" (meaning not stormy).

However, I can provide a basic structure based on your format, but keep in mind that much of the information will be based on the components of the word and general knowledge, rather than established definitions.
