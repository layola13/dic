  "word": "semiwarfares",
  "phonetics": "N/A",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "半矮秆品种",
  "definition": "Semiwarfares refers to plants, especially crops like wheat and rice, that have been bred to have shorter stems than their traditional counterparts. This characteristic makes them less prone to lodging (falling over) and allows for a greater proportion of the plant's energy to be directed towards grain production, resulting in higher yields.",
  "example": "The introduction of semiwarfares revolutionized agriculture by significantly increasing crop yields.",
  "synonyms": ["dwarf varieties", "short-statured crops"],
  "antonyms": ["tall varieties", "traditional crops"],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "context": "Agriculture",
        "example": "Semiwarfares are widely used in modern agriculture to improve crop productivity."
      },
      {
        "context": "Plant Breeding",
        "example": "Plant breeders develop semiwarfares to enhance yield and resistance to lodging."
      },
      {
        "context": "Research",
        "example": "Research on semiwarfares focuses on understanding the genetic and physiological mechanisms that control plant height."

    "technical_context": [
      {
        "field": "Genetics",
        "example": "The semi-dwarf phenotype is often associated with specific genes that regulate plant growth hormones."

        "field": "Agronomy",
        "example": "Agronomic practices for semiwarfares include optimized fertilizer application and irrigation to maximize yield."

      {
        "event": "Green Revolution",
        "example": "The Green Revolution saw the widespread adoption of semiwarfares, leading to significant increases in food production."
