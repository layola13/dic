  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "欠采样，采样不足",
  "definition": "In signal processing, missampling refers to the process where a signal is sampled at a rate that is insufficient to accurately represent it. This leads to a distorted or incomplete representation of the original signal, causing aliasing and loss of information.",
  "example": "The missampling of the audio signal resulted in noticeable distortion and loss of high-frequency content.",
  "synonyms": ["undersampling", "subsampling"],
  "antonyms": ["oversampling"],
  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "example": "Missampling can lead to inaccurate data analysis and flawed conclusions in scientific research.",
        "translation": "在科学研究中，欠采样可能导致不准确的数据分析和有缺陷的结论。"
      },
      {
        "example": "To avoid missampling, ensure that the sampling rate is at least twice the highest frequency component of the signal, according to the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem.",
        "translation": "为避免欠采样，根据奈奎斯特-香农采样定理，确保采样率至少是信号最高频率分量的两倍。"

      {
        "example": "In digital audio, missampling causes aliasing, where high-frequency sounds are incorrectly represented as lower frequencies.",
        "translation": "在数字音频中，欠采样会导致混叠，其中高频声音被错误地表示为较低频率。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Image missampling can result in jagged edges and the loss of fine details in the reconstructed image.",
        "translation": "图像欠采样可能导致重建图像中出现锯齿边缘和精细细节的丢失。"

    "data_analysis": [
      {
        "example": "Missampling in environmental monitoring can lead to an underestimation of pollution levels and a failure to detect critical events.",
        "translation": "环境监测中的欠采样可能导致对污染程度的低估，并可能无法检测到关键事件。"
      },
      {
        "example": "In market research, missampling the target demographic can skew survey results and lead to poor business decisions.",
        "translation": "在市场调查中，对目标人群的欠采样会扭曲调查结果，并导致糟糕的商业决策。"
