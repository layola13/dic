  "definition": "The aurora borealis (plural: aurorae boreales), also known as the Northern Lights, is a natural light display in the sky, predominantly seen in the high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras are produced when the magnetosphere is sufficiently disturbed by the solar wind that the trajectories of charged particles in both solar wind and magnetospheric plasma, mainly in the form of electrons and protons, precipitate them from space into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere).",
  "example": "The aurora-borealises painted the night sky with vibrant greens and purples.",
