I was unable to find a common English word spelled "demita" that has a widely recognized meaning and usage. It may be a proper noun, a technical term used in a specific field, a misspelling, or a word from a less common dialect or language. I can, however, provide you with a JSON format similar to the example you gave, but with a disclaimer.
