  "definition": "In graph theory, betweenness centrality is a measure of centrality in a graph based on shortest paths. For every pair of vertices in a connected graph, there exists at least one shortest path between the vertices. The betweenness centrality for each vertex is the number of these shortest paths that pass through the vertex.",
