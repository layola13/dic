I cannot provide a detailed JSON analysis for the word "parity's" in the same comprehensive format as the example for "what." The word "parity's" is a possessive form that combines the noun "parity" with a possessive marker, and it doesn't have the same range of grammatical uses, tenses, and idiomatic expressions that a word like "what" does. However, I can provide a basic breakdown of the word "parity" and how the possessive form is used.
