I was unable to find a precise definition, etymology, or common usages of the word "codrive" in standard dictionaries or linguistic resources. It may be a neologism, a technical term specific to a niche field, or a proprietary term. Without more context, I can only offer some educated guesses about its possible meaning and usage.
