    "sanguine_meaning": "'Sanguine' comes from the Latin 'sanguineus,' meaning 'bloody' or 'of blood.' In medieval physiology, it referred to having a complexion considered cheerful, ruddy, and confident. The term was associated with the belief that a predominance of blood as one of the four humors made a person cheerful and optimistic.",
    "evolution_of_meaning": "Over time, 'sanguine' came to mean generally optimistic or positive. Adding 'over-' to it creates 'oversanguine,' emphasizing an excessive or unrealistic level of optimism."
