  "translation": "Encheson is not a standard English word and therefore it has no official translation, however considering its roots might be related to 'Incision', it may refer to an act or place where incisions or cuts happen.",
  "definition": "This appears to be a non-standard or rare word. It is possibly a misspelling or a neologism.  Given its form, it might be related to incision or a similar concept. Therefore, the possible meaning refers to an act or place where incisions or cuts happen.  Without more context, a precise definition is impossible.",
  "example": "Without a specific context, it's difficult to create a meaningful example sentence. However, if we assume it is a typo of incision it can be applied to sentence such as, 'The surgeon made an encheson in order to perform the procedure.'",
