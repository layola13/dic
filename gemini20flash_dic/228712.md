  "word": "unbuffered",
  "phonetics": "/ʌnˈbʌfərd/",
  "part_of_speech": "adj.",
  "translation": "无缓冲的",
  "definition": "In computer science, 'unbuffered' describes a data stream or input/output operation where data is transferred directly between the source and destination without using an intermediate buffer. This means each write or read operation is handled immediately without any temporary storage.",
  "example": "Unbuffered I/O can be faster for certain applications because it avoids the overhead of copying data to and from a buffer.",
  "synonyms": ["direct", "immediate"],
  "antonyms": ["buffered"],
  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "example": "Using unbuffered input can lead to performance bottlenecks if the reading process is slow.",
        "translation": "如果读取过程缓慢，使用无缓冲输入可能会导致性能瓶颈。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The program uses unbuffered output to write data directly to the file.",
        "translation": "该程序使用无缓冲输出将数据直接写入文件。"
      }
    ],
    "technical_context": [
      {
        "example": "Unbuffered channels in Go require that a receiver is always ready to receive data when a sender sends it.",
        "translation": "Go 中的无缓冲通道要求在发送者发送数据时，接收者始终准备好接收数据。"
      },
      {
        "example": "In certain embedded systems, unbuffered data transfer is preferred due to memory constraints.",
        "translation": "在某些嵌入式系统中，由于内存限制，首选无缓冲数据传输。"
      }
    ],
    "performance_considerations": [
      {
        "example": "While unbuffered operations can be quicker, they also increase the load on the system due to frequent interrupts.",
        "translation": "虽然无缓冲操作可能更快，但由于频繁的中断，它们也会增加系统的负载。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The choice between buffered and unbuffered I/O depends on the specific requirements of the application.",
        "translation": "缓冲 I/O 和无缓冲 I/O 之间的选择取决于应用程序的特定要求。"
