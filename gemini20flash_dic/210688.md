Please provide the word you would like me to analyze in the JSON format. I need the "{subprimary}" to be replaced with the actual word you're interested in. For example:

```json
{
  "word": "example"
}
```

Once you provide the word, I will create a detailed JSON output similar to the "what" example you gave.
