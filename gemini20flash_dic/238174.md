  "translation": "不可重整化的",
  "definition": "In theoretical physics, specifically quantum field theory, an unrenormalizable theory is one where the infinities that arise in calculations cannot be removed by redefining a finite number of parameters. This typically implies that the theory is only valid as an effective field theory at energy scales below a certain cutoff.",
  "example": "String theory is proposed as a solution to provide a renormalizable theory of quantum gravity, as general relativity is unrenormalizable.",

  "antonyms": ["renormalizable"],

      {
        "example": "The standard model, while highly successful, faces challenges related to gravity, leading to investigations into theories that avoid unrenormalizable interactions.",

      {
        "example": "Effective field theories are often used to handle unrenormalizable interactions by introducing a cutoff scale.",
        "translation": "有效场论通常通过引入截止尺度来处理不可重整化的相互作用。"
