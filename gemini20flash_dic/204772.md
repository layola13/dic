I can certainly help you with that, but it seems there's a typo in the word you provided. Did you perhaps mean "hospital house" instead of "spitalhouse?" The latter doesn't seem to be a recognized English word.

If "spitalhouse" was indeed the word you were looking for, could you provide more context or clarify its meaning? This would allow me to provide a more accurate and detailed analysis.
