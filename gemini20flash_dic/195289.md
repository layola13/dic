  "word": "semihibernation",
  "phonetics": "/ˌsemɪˌhaɪbərˈneɪʃən/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "半冬眠",
  "definition": "A state of reduced physiological activity in certain animals, similar to hibernation but less profound, characterized by lower body temperature, slower breathing, and reduced metabolic rate, but with periods of activity or arousal.",
  "example": "During the cold months, some bear species enter a state of semihibernation, allowing them to conserve energy while still being able to react to environmental changes.",
