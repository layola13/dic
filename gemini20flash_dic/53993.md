  "definition": "In mathematics, the discriminant is a function of the coefficients of a polynomial equation which gives information about the nature of the roots of the polynomial.",

        "statement": "For a quadratic equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0, the discriminant (Δ) is given by Δ = b² - 4ac.",
