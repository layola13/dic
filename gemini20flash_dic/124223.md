I was unable to find a definition for the word "mosquian." It may be a newly coined term, a technical word used in a specific field, or simply a misspelling. If it is a misspelling, some possible correct words may be "mosquito" or another similar word.

I am able to provide a JSON format based on the template you gave, but the information will, unfortunately, be limited.

```json

  "word": "mosquian",
  "phonetics": "Unknown",
