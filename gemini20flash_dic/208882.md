  "translation": "鸟粪石",
  "definition": "A magnesium ammonium phosphate mineral (chemical formula: NH₄MgPO₄·6H₂O). It forms as white or yellowish orthorhombic crystals or in massive form. Struvite can be found in phosphate-rich environments such as decomposing organic matter, sewage, and urine. In medicine, it is known for forming kidney stones and bladder stones. In agriculture, it can be recovered from wastewater and used as a fertilizer.",
