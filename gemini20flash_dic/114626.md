I can certainly help you with that. Unfortunately, it seems that the word you have provided, "maleness's", is not a standard English word. It is a possessive form of "maleness," which refers to the state of being male. Because of this, I am unable to provide a comprehensive JSON analysis with phonetics, part of speech, usage examples, and other details as I did for the word "what". However, I can offer a basic breakdown:

```json
{
  "word": "maleness's",
  "part_of_speech": "noun (possessive)",
  "translation": "男性的... (所有格)",
  "definition": "The possessive form of 'maleness,' indicating something belonging to or associated with the state of being male.",
  "example": "The maleness's influence on the group was undeniable."
}
```

If you have another word you would like me to define, please feel free to ask!
