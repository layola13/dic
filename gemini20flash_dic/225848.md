I'll do my best to provide a detailed JSON format analysis for the word "tulus," mirroring the structure you provided for "what." However, "tulus" is not a standard English word. I will assume you meant to analyze it as a word that might appear in a different language (possibly Indonesian, where "tulus" means sincere or honest). Therefore, the information will be based on that interpretation, structuring the JSON as if it were an English entry.
