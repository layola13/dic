I'll do my best to provide a detailed JSON format analysis for the word "bildstein," similar to the example you gave for "what." However, "bildstein" doesn't appear to be a standard English word. It may be a proper noun, a term from another language, or a specialized or technical term.

I will proceed by assuming it is a compound word possibly of Germanic origin, and provide a hypothetical analysis based on that assumption.
