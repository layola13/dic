  "translation": "假性贫血（plural of pseudoanemia）",
  "definition": "A condition where a laboratory test suggests anemia, but the individual's true red blood cell mass is normal. This can be due to factors like hemodilution (increased plasma volume diluting the red blood cells) or laboratory errors.",

      {
        "sentence": "The patient's lab results showed anemia, but further investigation suggested it was a pseudoanemia.",
        "translation": "病人的实验室结果显示贫血，但进一步调查表明这是假性贫血。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "It's important to differentiate between true anemia and pseudoanemias to avoid unnecessary treatment.",
