  "translation": "深松 (Deep Loosening)",
  "definition": "A deep tillage practice that involves loosening the soil at a depth greater than normal tillage, typically 25-50 cm (10-20 inches), without inverting the soil layers.  It is used to break up compacted layers, improve drainage, and enhance root growth.",
  "example": "Farmers are using shensong to improve water infiltration in compacted fields.",
  "synonyms": ["subsoiling", "deep ripping", "deep tillage"],
  "antonyms": ["no-till farming", "conservation tillage", "surface tillage"],
  "usage": {
    "general_use": [
      { "example": "Shensong is important for improving soil health in areas with heavy clay soils.", "translation": "深松对于改善重黏土地区土壤健康非常重要。" },
