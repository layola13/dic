I can certainly help you create a JSON format breakdown of the word "doara". However, I must point out that "doara" is not a standard English word. It is possible that it is a proper noun, a term from a specific field, or a word from another language. Based on that information, I will create a detailed analysis in JSON format, including potential meanings, usages, and other relevant information.

```json
{
  "word": "doara",
  "phonetics": "/doʊˈɑːrə/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun (assumed)",
  "translation": "Assuming 'doara' is a name or specific term, the translation would depend on the context.",
  "definition": "Since 'doara' is not a standard English word, the definition would depend on its origin and usage. It could be a name, a technical term, or a foreign word.",
  "example": "Without further context, it's difficult to provide a meaningful example. If 'doara' refers to a person, an example could be: 'Doara is a talented artist.' If it's a place, it could be: 'Doara is a beautiful village.'",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage_examples": [
