  "definition": "Teleosaurus is an extinct genus of crocodile-like marine reptile belonging to the family Teleosauridae. These animals lived during the Jurassic period, with fossils found in Europe and South America. Teleosaurus was characterized by its elongated snout, adapted for catching fish, and its overall body shape suggests it was well-suited for a marine lifestyle.",
  "example": "Fossils of Teleosaurus have provided valuable insights into the evolution of marine reptiles during the Jurassic period.",
