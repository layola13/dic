  "word": "stackful",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": "adj.",
  "translation": "具有完整堆栈的",
  "definition": "In the context of computing, particularly in discussions of concurrency and threading, 'stackful' describes a model where each thread or execution context has its own complete stack space. This is in contrast to 'stackless' models where execution contexts may share a stack or have a more limited stack. Stackful coroutines, for example, maintain their own stack, allowing them to suspend and resume execution without losing their state.",
  "example": "Stackful coroutines are often used in scenarios where complex control flow and deep call stacks are required.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": ["stackless"],
  "usage": {
    "general_context": [
      {
        "example": "The operating system supports stackful threads, allowing each thread to have its own memory space for function calls and local variables.",
        "translation": "该操作系统支持具有完整堆栈的线程，允许每个线程拥有自己的内存空间，用于函数调用和局部变量。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Using stackful coroutines simplifies the implementation of complex asynchronous operations.",
        "translation": "使用具有完整堆栈的协程可以简化复杂异步操作的实现。"
      }
    ],
    "comparison_with_stackless": [
      {
        "example": "Stackful implementations generally offer greater flexibility but may incur higher memory overhead compared to stackless approaches.",
        "translation": "与无堆栈方法相比，有堆栈实现通常提供更大的灵活性，但可能会产生更高的内存开销。"
      },
      {
        "example": "While stackless coroutines require the programmer to manage state explicitly, stackful coroutines handle this automatically using their stack.",
        "translation": "虽然无堆栈协程要求程序员显式地管理状态，但有堆栈协程使用它们的堆栈自动处理这个问题。"
      }

    "specific_technologies": [
      {
        "example": "Some programming languages provide built-in support for stackful coroutines, making it easier to write concurrent code.",
        "translation": "一些编程语言为有堆栈协程提供内置支持，从而更容易编写并发代码。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The implementation of stackful threads can vary across different operating systems and architectures.",
