        "example": "Know then thyself, presume not God to scan; The proper study of Mankind is Man. Plac'd on this isthmus of a middle state, A being darkly wise, and rudely great: With too much knowledge for the Sceptic side, With too much weakness for the Stoic's pride, He hangs between; in doubt to act, or rest; In doubt to deem himself a God, or Beast; In doubt his Mind or Body to prefer; Born but to die, and reas'ning but to err; Alike in ignorance, his Reason such, Whether he thinks too little, or too much: Chaos of Thought and Passion, all confus'd; Still by himself abus'd, or disabus'd; Created half to rise, and half to fall; Great lord of all things, yet a prey to all; Sole judge of Truth, in endless Error hurl'd: The glory, jest, and riddle of the world! Go, wondrous creature! mount where Science guides, Go measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides; Instruct the planets in what orbs to run, Correct old Time, and regulate the Sun; Go soar with daring flight to realms unknown, And snatch immortal thunder from the throne! Seize Heav'n's own lightning, and out-reason Jove! Scarce can the mind digest what is too much. Now pleas'd to wither in perfection! Now, warmer climes to interpose! Then, nothing less will do than be an infidel, And cast his principles away. So, to be nothing more The glories of the bright, and roll the stars! Selve in the groves that breathe- not green, But, on that day, the very first day, the day of my last",
        "translation": "认识你自己，不要妄想看透上帝；人类的恰当研究对象是人。他位于中间状态的地峡上，是一个既聪明又粗俗的存在：对于怀疑论者来说，他有太多的知识，对于斯多葛派来说，他又有太多的弱点，他悬而未决；怀疑自己是行动还是休息；怀疑自己是把自己当成上帝还是野兽；怀疑是重视思想还是身体；生来就是为了死亡，推理只是为了犯错；同样无知，他的理性就是这样，无论他认为太少还是太多：思想和激情的混乱，一切都混乱了；仍然被自己滥用或不再被滥用；创造了一半是为了上升，一半是为了坠落；万物伟大的主人，却也是万物的猎物；真理的唯一审判者，却被抛入无尽的错误之中：世界的荣耀、笑柄和谜语！去吧，奇妙的生物！登上科学引导的地方，去测量地球，称量空气，确定潮汐；指导行星在什么轨道上运行，纠正旧时间，调节太阳；去吧，以大胆的飞行翱翔到未知的领域，从王座上夺取不朽的雷霆！抓住天堂自己的闪电，并胜过朱庇特的理性！心灵几乎无法消化太多的东西。现在很高兴在完美中枯萎！现在，更温暖的气候来介入！然后，没有什么比做一个不信者更少的了，并抛弃他的原则。所以，不再是明亮的光辉，而是滚动星星！沉浸在没有绿色的树林中，但是，在那一天，非常第一天，我最后的一天"
