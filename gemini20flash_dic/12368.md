I couldn't find a standard English word spelled "ashlaring." It is possible that it is a misspelling, a proper noun, a term from a specialized field, or a newly coined word.

If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to provide a more accurate analysis.

In the meantime, here's a JSON format for the information you requested. Since "ashlaring" doesn't have a standard definition, I've included placeholders for the information.
