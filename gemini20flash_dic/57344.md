I couldnâ€™t find a direct translation or standard definition for the word "dowral" in English. It might be a proper noun, a term from a specific field, a misspelling, or a word in another language. I can, however, offer a JSON format structure based on your example for "what," outlining potential fields if you have specific information about "dowral" to fill in:

```json
{
  "word": "dowral",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": null,
  "translation": null,
  "definition": null,
  "example": null,
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [],
    "present_continuous": [],
    "present_perfect": [],
    "present_perfect_continuous": [],
    "simple_past": [],
    "past_continuous": [],
    "past_perfect": [],
    "past_perfect_continuous": [],
    "simple_future": [],
    "future_continuous": [],
    "future_perfect": [],
    "future_perfect_continuous": [],
    "subjunctive_mood": [],
    "passive_voice": [],
    "interrogative_sentences": [],
    "negative_sentences": []
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [],
    "idioms": []
  }
}
```

If you can provide more context or information about the word "dowral," such as its origin, usage, or field of application, I can try to fill in the details in the JSON structure above.
