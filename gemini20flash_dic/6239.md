  "phonetics": "/ˈæmniˌoʊts/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "羊膜动物",
  "definition": "A group of tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates) that have an amnion during embryonic development. This group includes reptiles (including birds), mammals, and their extinct relatives. The amnion is a membrane that surrounds the embryo, providing a protective, fluid-filled environment. Amniotes are adapted for reproduction on land, as the amnion prevents the embryo from drying out.",
  "example": "Amniotes, such as reptiles, birds, and mammals, are characterized by their ability to lay eggs on land or retain the embryo within the mother.",
