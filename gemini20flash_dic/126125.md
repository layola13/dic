  "definition": "Plural form of 'mutex'. A mutex (mutual exclusion) is a programming object that allows multiple program threads to share the same resource, such as file access, but only one at a time. When a thread locks a mutex, it has exclusive access to the resource until it releases the mutex.",
  "example": "The program uses mutexes to prevent multiple threads from writing to the same file simultaneously.",
