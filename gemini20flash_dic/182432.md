After conducting several searches across multiple dictionaries and linguistic resources, I was unable to find any information or established usage for the word "reneye." It may be a misspelling, a neologism, or a term used within a specific context not covered by the resources I consulted. As a result, I have provided a JSON format with null values for the attributes.
