  "definition": "sRGB (standard Red Green Blue) is a standard RGB (red, green, blue) color space that HP and Microsoft created cooperatively in 1996 to use on monitors, printers, and the Web. sRGB uses a transfer function (also known as a 'gamma curve') that is similar to the CRT (cathode ray tube) displays of the time, so sRGB images looked good on these displays. sRGB is still widely used today.",
