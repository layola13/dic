  "translation": "重新发出信号；再信号传导",
  "definition": "Resignaling refers to the process where a signal, which was previously transmitted, is sent again. In biology, it often describes the renewed activation of a signaling pathway. In telecommunications, it can refer to the retransmission of a signal to ensure delivery or to re-establish a connection.",
  "example": "The resignaling of the growth factor receptor led to renewed cell proliferation.",
