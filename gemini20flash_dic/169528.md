  "word": "propellers",
  "phonetics": "/prəˈpelərz/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun (plural)",
  "translation": "螺旋桨 (复数)",
  "definition": "A mechanical device consisting of a rotating hub with radiating blades that are set at a pitch to form a helical spiral, that when rotated acts as an air or water screw to propel a vehicle.",
  "example": "The airplane's propellers spun rapidly, preparing for takeoff.",
  "synonyms": ["screw", "airscrew", "rotor"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "Ships and airplanes use propellers to move through the water and air.",
        "translation": "轮船和飞机使用螺旋桨在水和空气中移动。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The efficiency of a propeller depends on the shape and pitch of its blades.",
        "translation": "螺旋桨的效率取决于叶片的形状和螺距。"
      }
    ],
    "specific_contexts": [
      {
        "context": "Aviation",
        "example": "Aircraft propellers are designed to generate thrust by accelerating air rearward.",
        "translation": "飞机螺旋桨设计用于通过向后加速空气来产生推力。"
      },
      {
        "context": "Marine",
        "example": "Marine propellers are used to push boats and ships through the water.",
        "translation": "船用螺旋桨用于推动船只在水中航行。"

    "technical_aspects": [
      {
        "aspect": "Propeller pitch",
        "explanation": "Propeller pitch refers to the distance a propeller would advance forward in one revolution if it were moving through a solid medium. A steeper pitch requires more power but can generate more thrust.",
        "translation": "螺旋桨螺距是指螺旋桨在旋转一周时如果在固体介质中移动将向前移动的距离。 更陡峭的螺距需要更大的功率，但可以产生更大的推力。"
      },
      {
        "aspect": "Blade design",
        "explanation": "The design of the blades affects the propeller's efficiency and its ability to operate at different speeds. Different blade shapes are optimized for different applications.",
        "translation": "叶片的设计影响螺旋桨的效率及其在不同速度下运行的能力。不同的叶片形状针对不同的应用进行了优化。"
      }
    ],
    "figurative_usage": [
      {
        "example": "The new initiative acted as a propeller for the company's growth.",
        "translation": "新举措起到了推动公司增长的作用 (螺旋桨的角色)."
