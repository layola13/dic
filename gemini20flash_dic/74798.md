  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "触诊震颤",
  "definition": "A palpable vibration, especially in the chest wall, resulting from speech or other sounds.",

  "usage": {
    "general_use": [
      {
        "context": "In medicine, fremitus is assessed during a physical examination to evaluate the density of lung tissue.",
        "example": "The doctor palpated the patient's chest to assess for tactile fremitus."
      },
      {
        "context": "Fremitus can be affected by various conditions such as pneumonia, pleural effusion, or pneumothorax.",
        "example": "Decreased fremitus may suggest the presence of fluid or air in the pleural space."

        "example": "The nurse used tactile fremitus to evaluate for areas of increased density in the lungs."

        "technique": "Vocal Fremitus",
        "description": "Refers specifically to the vibration caused by the patient's voice.",

        "condition": "Pleural Effusion",
        "finding": "Decreased or absent fremitus.",

      {
        "example": "Tactile fremitus was increased in the right lower lobe.",

        "example": "Fremitus was decreased bilaterally at the lung bases.",
