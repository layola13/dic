I'll create a JSON object that defines the word "todayish." Because "todayish" isn't a standard dictionary word, I've taken a descriptive approach, defining it based on its likely usage and meaning.

```json
{
  "word": "todayish",
  "phonetics": "/təˈdeɪɪʃ/",
  "part_of_speech": "adjective, adverb (informal)",
  "translation": "接近今天，今天左右",
  "definition": "Referring to a time that is approximately today; near or around the current day.",
  "example": "I'll get that done todayish.",
  "synonyms": ["around today", "sort of today", "near today", "in the vicinity of today"],
  "antonyms": ["definitely not today", "not close to today"],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [
      {
        "question": "Is it going to rain todayish?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Do you think the package will arrive todayish?",
        "translation": "你认为包裹今天左右会到吗？"
      }
    ],
    "future_ планы": [
      {
        "question": "Will you finish the report todayish?",
        "translation": "你今天左右能完成报告吗？"

        "translation": "我们是今天左右还是明天见面？"
      }
    ],
    "informal_requests": [
