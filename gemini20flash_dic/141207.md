I was unable to find an exact definition and breakdown for the word "oopack" in standard dictionaries and linguistic resources. It is possible that "oopack" is a specialized term, a newly coined word, or a term specific to a particular field or context. Without more information, providing a detailed analysis in the format you requested is difficult.

I can offer a hypothetical analysis based on potential interpretations, but keep in mind this is speculative:
