  "definition": "Splicers are tools or devices used to join or connect things together. In genetics, 'splicers' refers to the proteins or enzymes involved in RNA splicing, a process where non-coding regions (introns) are removed from pre-mRNA and the coding regions (exons) are joined to form mature mRNA. In a more general sense, it can refer to anything that joins or connects two separate entities.",
