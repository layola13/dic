      {
        "description": "In environmental applications like wastewater treatment, preseparators remove large debris and solids to protect downstream equipment and improve treatment efficiency.",
        "example": "The preseparators at the wastewater plant significantly reduce the load on the primary clarifiers."
      },
      {
        "description": "Preseparators can also be found in air filtration systems, where they remove large particles before the air passes through finer filters.",
        "example": "The air filtration system uses preseparators to extend the life of the HEPA filters."
