  "definition": "Plural form of hypersensitization. Hypersensitization refers to an increased sensitivity or exaggerated response to a substance or stimulus. In a biological context, it often describes an immune response that is stronger than normal, leading to allergic reactions or other adverse effects.",
  "example": "The hypersensitizations observed in the study participants were likely due to repeated exposure to the allergen.",
