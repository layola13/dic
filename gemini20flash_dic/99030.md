  "definition": "The word 'interall' is not a standard English word. It may be a typo, a neologism (newly coined word), or a specialized term in a particular field. Without more context, it's impossible to provide a precise definition.  It is likely derived from the combination of \"inter\" and \"all\".  Potential meanings, based on the constituent parts, include: (1) Between all things. (2) Among all things. (3) Combining all things.  A more specific meaning would depend on context.  A search of online dictionaries and linguistic databases yields no results.",
