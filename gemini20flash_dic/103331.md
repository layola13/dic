I'll do my best to provide a detailed JSON format analysis for the word "jigjog," following the structure you provided for "what." However, "jigjog" is not a standard English word. It might be a misspelling, a neologism, or a term used in a specific context that isn't widely recognized. Given this, I will generate a JSON structure with the closest possible information based on potential interpretations.
