I was unable to find a definition or standard usage information for the word "musicianer." It is possible that this is a neologism (a newly coined word), a highly informal term, or a misspelling. It might also be used within a specific community or context that is not widely documented.

I can, however, provide a JSON format based on the template you provided for "what," but I will have to make some educated guesses as to the content, assuming "musicianer" is related to "musician":
