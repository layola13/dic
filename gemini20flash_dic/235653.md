  "definition": "Not relating to or indicating a place or location; specifically, in linguistics, referring to a case or grammatical form that does not express location.",
  "example": "The concept of 'unlocative' is often used in linguistic discussions to describe grammatical cases that serve functions other than indicating spatial location.",

  "usage": {
    "general_linguistics": [
      {
        "context": "In linguistic typology, the term 'unlocative' helps to categorize cases that have abstract meanings, such as instrumental, dative, or accusative, as opposed to concrete spatial meanings.",
        "example": "The Finnish language, while rich in locative cases, also features several unlocative cases that express a variety of semantic roles."
      },
      {
        "context": "When analyzing case systems in different languages, linguists differentiate between locative cases (indicating where something is) and unlocative cases (indicating other roles).",
        "example": "The accusative case in Latin is an unlocative case, primarily marking the direct object of a verb rather than a location."

    "theoretical_linguistics": [
      {
        "context": "In theoretical frameworks, 'unlocative' can be used to describe features of grammatical structures that do not encode spatial information.",
        "example": "Generative grammar might analyze certain prepositions as contributing unlocative features to a phrase, indicating a non-spatial relationship between elements."
      },
      {
        "context": "The distinction between locative and unlocative can be relevant in the study of semantic roles and thematic relations within a sentence.",
        "example": "The dative case, often expressing the recipient of an action, is considered an unlocative case that assigns a specific semantic role without spatial meaning."

    "comparative_linguistics": [
      {
        "context": "Comparative linguists use the concept of 'unlocative' to compare how different languages express non-spatial relationships through case markings or other grammatical means.",
        "example": "Comparing Indo-European languages, we can observe various unlocative cases that have evolved from earlier locative forms to express more abstract relationships."
      },
      {
        "context": "By examining how languages encode or do not encode spatial information, linguists can gain insights into the cognitive and cultural factors influencing language structure.",
        "example": "Some languages may rely more on prepositions to express unlocative relationships, while others use case endings, reflecting different typological strategies."
