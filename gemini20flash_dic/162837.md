  "translation": "预捕获",
  "definition": "In the context of regular expressions, precaptures refer to the substrings that are captured by capturing groups within a regular expression pattern before the main match is found. These captured substrings can then be used later in the regular expression or in the code that is processing the regular expression match.",
  "example": "In the regular expression `(\\d{4})-(\\d{2})-(\\d{2})`, the precaptures would be the year, month, and day captured before the entire date string is matched.",
  "synonyms": ["captured groups", "matched substrings"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "The regex engine first identifies the precaptures before determining the overall match.",
        "translation": "正则表达式引擎首先识别预捕获，然后再确定整体匹配。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Precaptures can be useful for extracting specific parts of a string during pattern matching.",

      {
        "example": "Many programming languages allow you to access the precaptures from a regular expression match using a group index or name.",

      },
      {
        "example": "In Python, you can use `match.group(1)` to access the first precapture.",
        "translation": "在Python中，您可以使用`match.group(1)`来访问第一个预捕获。"

      {
        "example": "Different regular expression engines may handle precaptures slightly differently, especially with regard to backreferences and named groups.",
