  "translation": "预先收集器 (复数形式)",
  "definition": "Devices or systems used to remove larger particles or contaminants from a gas stream before it enters the main collector (e.g., a filter or electrostatic precipitator). They are used to reduce the load on the main collector and improve its efficiency and lifespan.",
  "example": "Cyclone separators are often used as precollectors in industrial settings to remove large dust particles before the air passes through a more efficient but sensitive filter.",
  "synonyms": [
    "primary collectors",
    "coarse dust separators",
    "inlet separators"
  ],
  "antonyms": [
    "final collectors",
    "downstream filters"
  ],
  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "sentence": "Precollectors extend the life of the primary filtration system by removing large particles.",
        "translation": "预收集器通过去除大颗粒来延长主要过滤系统的寿命。"

      {
        "context": "Dust Collection",
        "sentence": "In dust collection systems, precollectors such as cyclone separators or settling chambers remove larger dust particles before they reach the main dust collector.",
        "translation": "在集尘系统中，诸如旋风分离器或沉降室之类的预收集器会在较大的灰尘颗粒到达主集尘器之前将其清除。"
      },
      {
        "context": "HVAC Systems",
        "sentence": "Precollectors in HVAC systems filter out larger debris like leaves and insects, preventing them from clogging the main filters.",
        "translation": "HVAC 系统中的预收集器会滤除较大的碎片（如树叶和昆虫），从而防止它们堵塞主过滤器。"

        "context": "Industrial Processes",
        "sentence": "In some industrial processes, precollectors remove specific contaminants to protect sensitive downstream equipment or processes.",

   "technical_specifications": [
        {
          "example": "Precollectors often have a lower collection efficiency for smaller particles compared to main collectors.",
          "translation": "与主收集器相比，预收集器通常对较小颗粒的收集效率较低。"
        },
        {
          "example": "The selection of a precollector depends on the size and type of particles to be removed, as well as the overall system requirements.",
