Okay, I will provide a detailed analysis of the English word "{heading}" in JSON format, following the structure you provided.

```json
{
  "word": "{heading}",
  "phonetics": "",
  "part_of_speech": "",
  "translation": "",
  "definition": "",
  "example": "",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [],
    "present_continuous": [],
    "present_perfect": [],
    "present_perfect_continuous": [],
    "simple_past": [],
    "past_continuous": [],
    "past_perfect": [],
    "past_perfect_continuous": [],
    "simple_future": [],
    "future_continuous": [],
    "future_perfect": [],
    "future_perfect_continuous": [],
    "subjunctive_mood": [],
    "passive_voice": [],
    "interrogative_sentences": [],
    "negative_sentences": []
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [],
    "idioms": []
  }
}
```

To proceed, please replace "{heading}" with the specific English word you would like me to analyze. I will then populate the JSON object with the relevant information, including phonetics, part of speech, translation, definition, example sentences, synonyms, antonyms, usage in different tenses, and common phrases/idioms.
