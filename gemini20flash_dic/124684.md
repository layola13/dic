**If "movic" refers to something else:**

To provide an accurate analysis, please provide more context. For example:

*   Is "movic" a company name?
*   Is it a term used in a specific industry?
*   Is it a misspelling of another word?

Once I have more information, I can create a JSON object that fits your requested format.
