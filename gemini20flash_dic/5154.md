I can certainly help you create a detailed JSON object similar to the one you provided for the word "what." However, the word "allens" is a proper noun (likely a surname or a place name) rather than a common English word with a standard definition, part of speech, and typical usage examples. Therefore, a direct translation and grammatical breakdown like the one for "what" wouldn't be applicable.

Instead, I can provide a JSON structure that acknowledges this and offers alternative information, such as possible origins, related words, and example usages in sentences.

```json
{
  "word": "allens",
  "phonetics": "/ˈælənz/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun (proper)",
  "translation": "艾伦斯 (人名/地名)",
  "definition": "Typically a surname or a place name. As a surname, it is of Scottish or Irish origin, derived from the Gaelic 'Ailin' meaning 'handsome' or 'harmony'. It can also be a possessive form of the given name 'Allen'.",
  "example": "The Allens are a well-known family in the town.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "examples": [

      },
      {
        "context": "Referring to a family:",
        "example": "We're going to the Allens' for dinner.",
        "translation": "我们要去艾伦斯家吃晚餐。"
      },

        "example": "Allens is a small village in the countryside.",

      }
    ]
  },
