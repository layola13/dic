  "notes": "The word 'compactednesses' is not commonly found in dictionaries, as it is a less frequently used plural form. It is derived from 'compactedness,' which itself is related to the more common term 'compactness.' The phonetic transcription is not readily available because it is a less common plural form. Pronunciation would follow the rules for English pluralization, adding an /ɪz/ sound to 'compactedness.'"
