I was unable to find information about the word "baenosome." It is possible that it is misspelled, is a technical term, or is a newly created word. I can, however, create a JSON format based on the "what" format that you provided, with empty values for the word "baenosome."

```json
{
  "word": "baenosome",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": null,
  "translation": null,
  "definition": null,
  "example": null,
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {},
  "phrases": {}
}
```

If you can provide more information or context about the word "baenosome", I can try again to find the relevant information and fill out the JSON object.
