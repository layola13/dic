  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "Physoclisti（硬骨鱼类的一个分类）",
  "definition": "A group of bony fishes that lack a pneumatic duct connecting the swim bladder to the gut. They regulate buoyancy by gas secretion and absorption via the blood.",
  "example": "Many advanced teleosts are physoclisti, allowing them greater control over their buoyancy.",

    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "The physoclisti are able to maintain their position in the water column without using as much energy as physostomes in some situations.",
        "translation": "在某些情况下，与具有气道鱼鳔的鱼类相比，硬骨鱼类能够在水中保持其位置，而无需消耗大量能量。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Research on physoclisti focuses on the mechanisms of gas exchange in the swim bladder.",
        "translation": "对硬骨鱼类的研究侧重于鱼鳔中的气体交换机制。"

      {
        "example": "In studies of fish evolution, the presence or absence of a pneumatic duct (as seen in physoclisti vs. physostomi) is a key characteristic.",

        "example": "The swim bladder in physoclisti functions more like a closed system compared to the open system in physostomes.",
