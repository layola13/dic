  "definition": "In mathematics, especially in algebraic geometry, 'quasi-ordinary' describes a type of singularity of an algebraic variety. Specifically, it refers to singularities that can be resolved by a single application of a quasi-ordinary cover (ramification). These singularities are 'almost' ordinary in the sense that their structure is close to that of a normal crossing.",
