  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "流变剂",
  "definition": "A substance whose viscosity changes with the rate of shear, specifically one that becomes less viscous as the shear rate increases (shear-thinning) and recovers its original viscosity when the shear is removed or reduced.",
  "example": "Some paints are rheotropic, becoming easier to apply when brushed but thickening again afterward to prevent drips.",

    "thixotropic substance",
    "shear-thinning agent"
