I was unable to find an exact definition, usage, or examples for the word "unprince" in common dictionaries or language resources. It is possible that "unprince" is a neologism, a very rare word, or used in a specific context that is not widely documented.

However, I can offer a potential analysis based on its structure: The prefix "un-" generally means "not" or "reverse of." Therefore, "unprince" could conceptually mean "not a prince" or "to deprive of princely status or qualities."

Given this, here's a possible JSON structure based on your example, keeping in mind that some fields will be speculative:
