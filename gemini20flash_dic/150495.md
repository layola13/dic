  "definition": "A person who operates a pantograph, which is a mechanical linkage connected in a manner based on parallelograms so that the movement of one pen, in tracing an image, produces identical movements in a second pen. If the linkage's geometry is changed, the second pen can produce an image at a chosen scale (enlarged or shrunk) to the image traced by the first pen.",
