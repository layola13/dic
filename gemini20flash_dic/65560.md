  "translation": "富营养化（eutrophy的复数形式）",
  "definition": "The process by which a body of water acquires a high concentration of nutrients, especially phosphates and nitrates. These typically promote excessive growth of algae. As the algae die and decompose, high levels of organic matter and the decomposing organisms deplete available oxygen, causing the death of other organisms, such as fish. (Plural form of eutrophy).",
  "example": "The excessive use of fertilizers can lead to eutrophies in nearby lakes and rivers.",
