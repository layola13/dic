I can certainly help you with that! However, it is important to note that "thoroughbrednesses" is not a recognized English word. It is the plural form of an abstract noun derived from "thoroughbred," which usually refers to a breed of horse or a person of pure breeding. Since it's not a standard word, a full analysis like the one you provided for "what" is not really possible. However, I can still offer a breakdown based on its likely construction and possible interpretations:
