Based on my search, "puteli" doesn't appear to be a standard English word. Consequently, I can't provide the detailed analysis in the format you requested. It might be a misspelling, a word from another language, or a neologism (newly coined word). If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more helpful explanation.
