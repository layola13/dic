I can certainly help you with that. I want to first clarify that the word you provided, "lawnier," is not a standard English word. It may be a misspelling or a less common term. Assuming it might be a variant of "lawyer" or a similar term, I'll provide a detailed JSON format analysis based on that assumption.
