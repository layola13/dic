I'm sorry, but I am unable to provide a detailed JSON parsing for the word "underreceivers" as it is not a standard English word. It seems to be a compound word formed by combining "under" and "receivers." Here's a breakdown of the components, but I cannot provide the depth of analysis seen in your example:

```json
{
  "word": "underreceivers",
  "part_of_speech": "noun (likely)",
  "definition": "This word is not found in standard dictionaries. It likely refers to entities or devices that receive something in a subordinate or insufficient manner.",
  "components": {
    "under": {
      "definition": "In a lower position; below; beneath; less than; not enough."
    },
    "receivers": {
      "definition": "Plural of receiver: A person or thing that receives something."
    }
  },
  "possible_usage": "Could potentially describe individuals or systems that are not adequately receiving signals, information, or resources.",
  "example": "The project suffered because of underreceivers within the communication network; key personnel were not getting critical updates in a timely manner."
}
```
