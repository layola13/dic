  "translation": "室背开裂的",
  "definition": "Describing a type of dehiscence in a dry fruit (such as a capsule) where the fruit splits along the locules (chambers or compartments) or along the median line of each carpel, rather than between them.  This results in the fruit wall splitting open into the locule, releasing the seeds directly from the locule.",
  "example": "The poppy capsule exhibits loculicidal dehiscence, splitting open along its carpels to release the numerous seeds.",
