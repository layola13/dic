  "definition": "A schizopod is a type of crustacean belonging to the order Mysida. These are small, shrimp-like creatures characterized by their biramous (two-branched) thoracic legs, which are used for swimming and creating a feeding current. Schizopods are typically marine animals, although some species can be found in brackish or fresh water. They are an important part of the marine food web, serving as a food source for larger animals.",
