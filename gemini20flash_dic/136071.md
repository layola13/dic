  "definition": "Not recessive; pertaining to a gene or trait that is expressed when present in only one copy (heterozygous condition).  A nonrecessive allele will express its trait even if the other allele is different.",
  "example": "The nonrecessive trait of brown eyes was expressed in the offspring, even though the other parent had blue eyes (a recessive trait).",
