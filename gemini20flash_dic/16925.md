  "definition": "Basos refers to basophils, a type of white blood cell. Although I could not find a direct definition for 'basos' as a standalone word, it's likely a shortened, informal reference to conditions involving basophils, particularly basophilia. Basophilia is a condition characterized by an elevated number of basophils in the bloodstream.",

      {
        "example": "The doctor ordered a complete blood count to check for any abnormalities, including a high basos level.",
        "translation": "医生要求进行全血细胞计数，以检查是否有任何异常，包括高嗜碱性粒细胞水平。"
