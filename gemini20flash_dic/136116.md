  "definition": "In biochemistry, a nonreducing sugar is a carbohydrate that is not oxidized by a weak oxidizing agent (e.g., Benedict's reagent) in basic aqueous solution. This is because the sugar lacks a free aldehyde or ketone group.",
  "example": "Sucrose is a nonreducing sugar because both anomeric carbons are involved in the glycosidic bond.",

    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "The nonreducing end of a polysaccharide is the end where the terminal sugar's anomeric carbon is not involved in a glycosidic bond.",
        "translation": "多糖的非还原性末端是指末端糖的端基碳未参与糖苷键结合的那一端。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Glycoproteins often have nonreducing terminal sugars that can serve as recognition signals.",

        "example": "The sample was treated to remove reducing sugars before analysis to specifically detect nonreducing carbohydrates.",
