  "definition": "Relating to a consonant that is articulated without a puff of air following its release. In phonetics, nonaspiration refers to the production of a stop consonant without aspiration, meaning there is no significant delay in the onset of voicing after the release of the consonant. This contrasts with aspirated consonants, which are followed by a noticeable puff of air.",
  "example": "In English, /p/, /t/, and /k/ are nonaspirated after /s/ as in 'spin,' 'stun,' and 'skin,' but aspirated at the beginning of a word, like 'pin,' 'tin,' and 'kin.'",
