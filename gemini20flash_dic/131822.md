  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "非守恒性",
  "definition": "Plural form of nonconservation. Refers to the failure of a physical quantity to be conserved in a particular process or interaction. In physics, conservation laws state that certain measurable properties of an isolated physical system do not change as the system evolves over time. When a quantity is 'nonconserved,' it means the total amount of that quantity changes during a process.",
  "example": "The observation of nonconservation of parity in weak interactions was a groundbreaking discovery.",
  "synonyms": ["violation of conservation", "lack of conservation"],
  "antonyms": ["conservation"],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "Studies of particle physics often reveal nonconservations of certain quantum numbers under specific conditions.",

      },
      {
        "example": "The nonconservations observed in these experiments challenge the standard model of physics.",
