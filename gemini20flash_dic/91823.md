  "definition": "Hypergeneses is the plural form of hypergenesis. Hypergenesis refers to excessive or abnormal development or growth. In geology, it can describe surface and near-surface processes that lead to the formation of sedimentary rocks and mineral deposits under conditions of low temperature and pressure.",
  "example": "The hypergeneses of certain minerals can result in valuable ore deposits.",
  "synonyms": ["overdevelopment", "excessive growth"],
  "antonyms": ["atrophy", "underdevelopment"],
  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "context": "In geology, hypergeneses refers to the set of processes occurring at or near the Earth's surface that lead to the breakdown and alteration of rocks and minerals.",
        "example": "The study of hypergeneses helps us understand the formation of various sedimentary rocks."
      },
      {
        "context": "In biology, it may refer to an abnormal or excessive growth pattern.",
        "example": "Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind hypergeneses in certain organisms."

    "specific_contexts": [
      {
        "context": "Describing the formation of laterite soils.",

        "context": "Explaining the origin of certain types of mineral deposits.",
        "example": "The occurrence of certain minerals can be attributed to hypergeneses processes acting over long periods."
