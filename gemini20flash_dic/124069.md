  "definition": "The branch of linguistics that studies the interaction between morphology (the study of word structure) and phonology (the study of sound systems). It examines how the pronunciation of morphemes (the smallest meaningful units of language) changes in different contexts and how these changes are governed by phonological rules.",
  "example": "The morphonomy of the English plural system explains why 'cat' becomes 'cats' with an /s/ sound, while 'dog' becomes 'dogs' with a /z/ sound.",
