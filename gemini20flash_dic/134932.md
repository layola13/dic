  "definition": "Not having a myelin sheath; lacking a myelin sheath. The myelin sheath is a fatty insulation layer around nerve cells (neurons) that allows electrical impulses to transmit quickly and efficiently along the nerve cells.",
  "example": "Nonmyelinated nerve fibers conduct impulses more slowly than myelinated fibers.",

  "usage": {
    "general_use": [
      {
        "example": "Pain signals are often carried by nonmyelinated C fibers.",
        "translation": "疼痛信号通常由非髓鞘化的C纤维传递。"

        "example": "The proportion of nonmyelinated to myelinated fibers can be altered in certain neurological conditions.",
