I was unable to find an exact match for the word "matay" in English dictionaries or standard word lists. It's possible that "matay" is a misspelling, a word from a language other than English, a proper noun, or a very specialized term.

Assuming that "matay" was a misspelling of "matter," I have included an analysis similar to the format you requested.
