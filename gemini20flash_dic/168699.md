  "definition": "This is the plural form of 'procreativeness,' which refers to the quality or state of being creative; the ability to produce or bring into existence. It's a very uncommon word, particularly in the plural.",
  "example": "While we can discuss different aspects of procreativeness, discussing multiple 'procreativenesses' in a single context is extremely unusual and likely grammatically incorrect.",
  "synonyms": ["creativity", "originality", "inventiveness", "imagination"],
  "antonyms": ["sterility", "inability to create"],
  "usage": {
    "notes": "The word 'procreativenesses' is highly unusual and almost never used.  'Procreativeness' itself is rare.  It's generally better to use 'creativity' or other synonyms.  Because of its rarity, providing example sentences in different tenses is not practical.  It's far more common to discuss aspects *of* creativity than to use this noun itself, especially in plural form.",
    "common_mistakes": "Using 'procreativenesses' in any sentence. It sounds awkward and is not standard English.  Prefer 'creativity' or 'creative abilities'."
