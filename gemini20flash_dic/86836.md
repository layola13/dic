  "translation": "苏木精",
  "definition": "A compound extracted from the heartwood of the logwood tree (Haematoxylum campechianum).  It is used extensively as a nuclear stain in histology and pathology.  After oxidation (usually to hematein), and combined with a mordant, it produces a deep blue or purple color in stained cells, particularly binding to nucleic acids in the cell nucleus.",
  "example": "Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining is a common method in histology.",
  "synonyms": ["haematoxylin"],
