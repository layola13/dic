  "translation": "吸水的; 水溶性的 (More accurately: able to absorb or dissolve in water.  The word itself is quite rare.)",
  "definition": "Capable of absorbing or dissolving in water. While technically valid, the term 'hydrosorbic' is infrequently used in scientific literature.  More common alternatives include 'hygroscopic' (for absorbing moisture from the air) and 'water-soluble'.",
  "example": "Although theoretically applicable to certain materials, the term 'hydrosorbic' is less common than 'hygroscopic' to describe substances absorbing moisture from the air.  A salt that readily dissolves in water could be described as water-soluble rather than hydrosorbic.",
  "synonyms": ["hygroscopic (for absorbing moisture)", "water-soluble (for dissolving)", "hydrophilic (water-loving)"],
  "antonyms": ["hydrophobic (water-repelling)"],
  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "sentence": "The research paper rarely used the adjective 'hydrosorbic', preferring more common terms.",
        "translation": "该研究论文很少使用形容词“hydrosorbic”，而是更喜欢使用更常见的术语。"

      {
        "sentence": "The properties of the new polymer were described as 'water-soluble' rather than 'hydrosorbic'.",

        "sentence": "While technically correct, 'hydrosorbic' isn't the preferred term when discussing the water absorption capacity of soil.",
        "translation": "虽然技术上正确，但在讨论土壤的吸水能力时，“hydrosorbic”不是首选术语。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "For detailed analysis of water dissolving abilities use the terms 'water solubility' rather than relying on term hydrosorbic'.",
        "translation": "要详细分析水的溶解能力，请使用术语'水溶性'，而不是依赖术语hydrosorbic'。"

  "notes": "The word 'hydrosorbic' is relatively uncommon.  Consider using more standard terms like 'hygroscopic' or 'water-soluble' for clarity and broader understanding.  Its usage often implies a direct interaction with liquid water, while 'hygroscopic' refers specifically to absorbing moisture from the air. It is important to correctly identify the usage as dissolving or absorption from air."
