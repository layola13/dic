**Explanation of the Word "Ghazi"**

A "ghazi" is a Muslim fighter or warrior, often associated with fighting against non-Muslims in defense or expansion of Muslim lands or beliefs. Historically, the term has been used to describe warriors in the early Islamic conquests and during the Ottoman Empire.
