I'll do my best to provide a detailed JSON format analysis of the word "overedits," but I must note that "overedits" isn't a standard, widely-recognized word in the English language. It's possible it could be a niche term, a newly coined word, or a typo. Because of this, I'll have to extrapolate some of the information based on the likely meaning and structure of the word.
