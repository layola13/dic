  "phonetics": "/ˌoʊvoʊvɪˈvɪpərɪzəm/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "卵胎生",
  "definition": "A mode of reproduction in animals in which embryos develop inside eggs that are retained within the mother's body until they are ready to hatch. The developing embryos are nourished by the egg yolk, not directly by the mother, but receive gas exchange and waste removal benefits from the mother. The young are born as live offspring.",
  "example": "Ovoviviparism is observed in some sharks, reptiles, and insects.",
  "synonyms": ["aplacental viviparity", "egg-live birth"],
  "antonyms": ["oviparity", "viviparity"],
  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "example": "Ovoviviparism is an evolutionary strategy that bridges oviparity (egg-laying) and viviparity (live birth).",
        "translation": "卵胎生是一种连接卵生和胎生的进化策略。"
      },
      {
        "example": "In ovoviviparous animals, the eggs hatch inside the mother, and the young are born alive shortly thereafter.",
        "translation": "在卵胎生动物中，卵在母体内孵化，幼崽不久后便出生。"
      }
    ],
    "scientific_context": [
      {
        "example": "The distinction between ovoviviparity and viviparity can sometimes be subtle, depending on the degree of maternal support.",
        "translation": "根据母体支持的程度，卵胎生和胎生之间的区别有时可能很微妙。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Some species of sharks exhibit ovoviviparism, where the developing embryos feed on yolk sacs within the uterus.",
        "translation": "一些种类的鲨鱼表现出卵胎生，发育中的胚胎在子宫内以卵黄囊为食。"

    "comparative_biology": [
      {
        "example": "Compared to oviparity, ovoviviparism provides greater protection for the developing embryo.",
        "translation": "与卵生相比，卵胎生为发育中的胚胎提供了更大的保护。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Unlike viviparity, ovoviviparity does not involve the direct transfer of nutrients from the mother to the developing embryo.",
        "translation": "与胎生不同，卵胎生不涉及从母亲到发育中的胚胎的直接营养转移。"
