Please provide the word(s) for which you would like a detailed analysis in the JSON format as exemplified with "what." I need the `pretokens` value to proceed. For example, you would provide the request like this:

```json
{
"pretokens": "example_word"
}
```

Replace `"example_word"` with the actual word you want me to analyze. I will then create a comprehensive JSON object containing the word's phonetics, part of speech, translation, definition, example usages, synonyms, antonyms, and common phrases, mirroring the structure you provided for "what."
