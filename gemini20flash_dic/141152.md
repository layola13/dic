I can certainly help you with that! However, I believe there may be a slight typo in the word you provided. Did you perhaps mean "zoological" instead of "ooelogical"? "Zoological" is a real English word, while "ooelogical" does not appear to be.

If you did mean "zoological," here is the JSON formatted breakdown:

If, on the other hand, you were looking for "ooelogical," could you please provide more context or verify the spelling? This would allow me to create the JSON breakdown you requested.
