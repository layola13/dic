  "definition": "Describing a camera or imaging system that does not use a mechanical shutter to control exposure. Instead, the image sensor is electronically controlled to start and stop the acquisition of light.",
  "example": "This new phone boasts a shutterless camera, allowing for faster and quieter image capture.",
  "synonyms": ["electronic shutter", "global shutter"],
  "antonyms": ["mechanical shutter"],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "Shutterless cameras are increasingly used in smartphones and machine vision applications.",
        "translation": "无快门相机越来越多地应用于智能手机和机器视觉应用中。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The primary advantage of a shutterless design is the elimination of moving parts, which increases reliability and reduces noise.",
