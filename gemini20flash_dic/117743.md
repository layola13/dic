  "definition": "Melanocytes are melanin-producing cells located in the bottom layer of the skin's epidermis, the middle layer of the eye (uvea), inner ear, meninges, bones, and heart. Melanin is a pigment responsible for the color of skin, hair, and eyes. Melanocytes produce and transfer melanin to keratinocytes, the predominant cells in the epidermis.",
