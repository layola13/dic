  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "超突变性 (复数)",
  "definition": "The plural form of hypermutability, which refers to an increased rate of mutation. Mutation is when the DNA sequence changes. Hypermutation results in a high frequency of mutation.",
  "example": "The hypermutabilities observed in certain viruses contribute to their rapid evolution and resistance to antiviral drugs.",
  "synonyms": [
    "accelerated mutation rates",
    "enhanced mutability",
    "increased mutation frequency"
  ],

    "genetic stability",
    "low mutation rate"
  ],
  "usage": {
    "general_contexts": [
      {
        "sentence": "Hypermutabilities can arise in various biological contexts, including viral infections and cancer development.",
