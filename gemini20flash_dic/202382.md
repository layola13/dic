      "The term 'sodomitical' is considered outdated, offensive, and potentially stigmatizing in modern usage.  It carries historical baggage associated with discriminatory laws and religious persecution.  More respectful and accurate terms, such as 'homosexual' (when referring to sexual orientation) or descriptions of specific sexual acts, should be preferred.",
