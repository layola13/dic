I was unable to find a direct translation and definition for the word "trugger" in English. It may be a technical term, a proper noun, a misspelling, or a word in a language other than English. Without further context, it's difficult to provide a detailed analysis in the JSON format you requested.

I can offer a general structure that you can populate with the correct information once you have it:
