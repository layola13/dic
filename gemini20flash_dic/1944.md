  "translation": "Actinula幼虫",
  "definition": "The free-swimming, planktonic larva of certain hydrozoans, such as species of the genus Tubularia. It represents a developmental stage between the planula and the adult polyp. Actinula larvae are characterized by a simple body plan consisting of an elongated or cylindrical body with tentacles at one end and an adhesive organ at the other, which they use to attach to a substrate and develop into a polyp.",
  "example": "The actinula larva of Tubularia exhibits a distinct set of behaviors that facilitate its dispersal and settlement in suitable habitats.",
