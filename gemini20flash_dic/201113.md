  "definition": "In the context of networking, 'slowback' refers to a deliberate reduction in network speed or bandwidth. It can be implemented for various reasons, such as managing network congestion, prioritizing certain types of traffic, or simulating network conditions for testing purposes. It is often used to simulate a slow network connection.",
  "example": "The network administrator implemented slowback during peak hours to ensure fair bandwidth allocation.",
  "synonyms": ["throttle", "bandwidth limiting", "traffic shaping", "delay"],
  "antonyms": ["speed up", "accelerate", "increase bandwidth"],

    "general": [
      {
        "example": "The slowback was implemented to prevent network congestion during the data transfer.",
