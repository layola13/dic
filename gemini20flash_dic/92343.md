I was unable to find a direct entry for the word "hypoarian" in the format you requested, but I can offer some information that might be helpful, formatted as a JSON object. "Hypoarian" isn't a standard English word and is likely a misspelling or a term used within a very specific context. It might be a combination of "hypo-" (meaning "under," "below," or "less than") and "Arian," possibly relating to a subgroup or a modified version of something associated with Arianism (an early Christian theological concept).
