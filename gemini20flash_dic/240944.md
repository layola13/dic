I was unable to find enough information about the word "untrowable" to create the detailed JSON object you requested. It might be a very new word, a misspelling, or a term used within a specific community that is not widely documented. I can offer you a JSON object with basic information based on its possible structure, but I cannot provide the detailed usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or idiomatic phrases that you were hoping for.

```json
{
  "word": "untrowable",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": "adj.",
  "translation": "无法投掷的",
  "definition": "Not able to be thrown; physically impossible or very difficult to throw.",
  "example": "The oddly shaped rock was untrowable due to its unbalanced weight.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {},
  "phrases": {}
}
```

Here's what each part represents:

*   **word**: The word itself.
*   **phonetics**: This is left as `null` because I couldn't find a reliable phonetic transcription.
*   **part\_of\_speech**: I've tentatively marked it as an adjective ("adj.") based on how it's likely used.
*   **translation**: A basic Chinese translation based on its components.
*   **definition**: A simple definition of what the word likely means.
*   **example**: A sentence showing how the word might be used.
*   **synonyms** and **antonyms**: These are empty arrays because I couldn't find any established synonyms or antonyms.
*   **usage** and **phrases**: These are empty objects because there's not enough information to provide detailed examples.

If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to refine the information.
