  "definition": "In computer science, nonprimitives refer to data types that are not built-in or basic data types provided by a programming language. Instead, they are created by the programmer or are derived from primitive data types. Nonprimitive data types are also known as reference types because they store the address or reference to the memory location where the data is stored, rather than storing the actual data value directly.",
  "example": "Arrays, strings, objects, and linked lists are examples of nonprimitive data types.",
