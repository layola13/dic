  "translation": "前寰椎",
  "definition": "The proatlas is a small, inconstant bone occasionally found in the human skeleton, located between the occipital bone and the atlas (the first cervical vertebra). It represents the embryonic precursor to the atlas and occipital bone. In reptiles and birds, the proatlas is a separate vertebral element between the atlas and the occipital bone.",
  "example": "The proatlas is a rare anatomical variant in humans, but a normal structure in many reptiles.",

  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "example": "During embryonic development, the proatlas contributes to the formation of the atlas and the base of the occipital bone.",
        "translation": "在胚胎发育过程中，前寰椎有助于寰椎和枕骨底部的形成。"
      },
      {
        "example": "In reptiles, the proatlas forms a distinct vertebral element, providing additional flexibility to the neck.",

      {
        "example": "The presence of a persistent proatlas in humans can sometimes be associated with congenital anomalies of the craniovertebral junction.",

        "example": "Imaging studies, such as CT scans or MRI, can be used to identify the proatlas and assess its relationship to the surrounding structures.",
