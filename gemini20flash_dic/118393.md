  "translation": "部分卵裂的",
  "definition": "Relating to or denoting cleavage in a fertilized ovum in which only part of the ovum is subject to cleavage.",
  "example": "The chick embryo undergoes meroblastic cleavage due to the large amount of yolk in the egg.",
  "synonyms": ["partial cleavage"],

  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "sentence": "Meroblastic cleavage occurs in eggs with a high concentration of yolk, such as those of birds and reptiles.",
        "translation": "部分卵裂发生在卵黄浓度高的卵子中，如鸟类和爬行动物的卵子。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "In meroblastic cleavage, only a portion of the egg divides, leading to the formation of a blastodisc.",
        "translation": "在部分卵裂中，只有卵子的部分区域分裂，从而形成胚盘。"

    "types": [
      {
        "type": "Discoidal Meroblastic Cleavage",
        "description": "Occurs in eggs with a large amount of yolk where the cleavage is restricted to a small disc on the animal pole.",
        "example": "Discoidal meroblastic cleavage is observed in bird eggs.",
        "translation": "盘状部分卵裂发生在卵黄量大的卵子中，卵裂仅限于动物极上的一个小盘。"

        "type": "Superficial Meroblastic Cleavage",
        "description": "Occurs in eggs with a large amount of centrally located yolk, where the cleavage is restricted to the periphery of the egg.",
        "example": "Superficial meroblastic cleavage is seen in insect eggs.",
        "translation": "表面部分卵裂发生在卵黄大量集中在中心的卵子中，卵裂仅限于卵子的外围。"

      {
        "aspect": "Holoblastic Cleavage",
        "description": "Total or complete cleavage of the egg.",
        "contrast": "Unlike meroblastic cleavage where only part of the egg divides.",
        "example": "Holoblastic cleavage is common in eggs with little yolk, such as those of mammals.",
        "translation": "全卵裂是卵子的完全分裂，与部分卵裂不同，后者仅分裂卵子的部分区域。"
