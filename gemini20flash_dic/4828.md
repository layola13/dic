  "word": "aliasing",
  "phonetics": "/ˈeɪliəsɪŋ/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "混叠",
  "definition": "In signal processing and computer graphics, aliasing refers to the distortion or artifact that results when a signal sampled at a discrete rate is not adequately represented, causing different signals to become indistinguishable from each other. In computer graphics, it often appears as jagged edges on objects that should be smooth.",
  "example": "The aliasing effect in the image made the edges of the lines appear jagged.",
  "synonyms": [
    "distortion",
    "artifact",
    "stair-stepping"
  ],
  "antonyms": [
    "anti-aliasing",
    "smoothing"

  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "Aliasing can occur in digital audio when high-frequency sounds are not properly filtered before sampling.",
        "translation": "当高频声音在采样前没有被适当过滤时，数字音频中可能会发生混叠。"
      },

        "example": "In computer graphics, aliasing is often reduced by using anti-aliasing techniques.",

        "example": "Oversampling can help reduce aliasing by capturing more data points.",

        "example": "Supersampling is a technique used to reduce aliasing by rendering an image at a higher resolution and then downsampling it.",
