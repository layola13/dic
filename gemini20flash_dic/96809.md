  "word": "inertias",
  "phonetics": "/ɪˈnɜːrʃəz/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "惯性（复数）",
  "definition": "Plural form of inertia. Inertia refers to the tendency of an object to resist changes in its state of motion. This resistance to change means that an object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an external force.",
  "example": "The inertias of different objects vary depending on their mass; larger masses have greater inertia.",
  "synonyms": [
    "inactivity",
    "lethargy",
    "sluggishness",
    "momentum",
    "resistance"

    "activity",
    "energy",
    "dynamism"
  ],

    "physics_context": [
      {
        "sentence": "In physics, inertias are quantified by mass; the greater the mass, the greater the inertia.",
        "translation": "在物理学中，惯性由质量量化；质量越大，惯性越大。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "Different objects have different inertias, which affect how easily they accelerate.",
        "translation": "不同的物体有不同的惯性，这影响了它们加速的难易程度。"
