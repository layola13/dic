    "origin": "The word 'tawdry' comes from 'Tawdry Lace,' a shortened form of 'St. Audrey's Lace.' St. Audrey was a 7th-century English saint, and lace and ribbons bought at the St. Audrey's Fair in Ely were known for their cheapness and poor quality.",
    "historical_context": "Over time, 'tawdry' evolved to describe anything cheap, showy, and of poor taste, reflecting the initial association with the low-quality goods sold at the fair."
