  "definition": "Relating to myoepithelium, which are specialized epithelial cells with contractile properties similar to those of smooth muscle cells. These cells are typically found in glandular tissues, such as salivary glands, mammary glands, and sweat glands, where they aid in the secretion process by contracting and squeezing the glandular cells.",
  "example": "Myoepithelial cells play a crucial role in milk ejection from the mammary glands.",
