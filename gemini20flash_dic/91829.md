  "translation": "过度遗传性 (一个推测或假设的性质，指过度受到基因影响的状态)",
  "definition": "A hypothetical or speculative property referring to the state of being excessively influenced by genes. This is a rarely used, and arguably non-standard, word. It's formed from combining 'hyper-' (excessive), 'genetical' (relating to genetics), and '-ness' (denoting a state or quality).",
