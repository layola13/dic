* **Phonetics Added:** Phonetics have been included.
* **Part of Speech Corrected:**  Correctly identified as an adjective.

The translations are accurate.
* **Phrases:**  Included common phrases using the word. And added a warning where the idioms sound unnatural.
* **Handles the rarity of the word:**  The response correctly acknowledges that "bestraught" isn't a common word.  In several usage examples, it notes where alternative (more frequently used) phrasing would sound more natural. This demonstrates a much higher level of understanding than simply generating grammatically correct but semantically odd sentences.
