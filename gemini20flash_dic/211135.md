I can certainly help you with that. It seems the word "subsuperficial" is not a commonly used word in the English language. This makes it difficult to provide a comprehensive analysis in the format you requested.

However, based on its morphology (the combination of prefixes and root words), we can infer a potential meaning and structure for a JSON response.

Here's a possible interpretation and a corresponding JSON structure:

```json
{
  "word": "subsuperficial",
  "phonetics": "Based on pronunciation rules, likely /sʌbˌsuːpərˈfɪʃəl/",
  "part_of_speech": "Adjective",
  "translation": "Slightly superficial or located just beneath the surface",
  "definition": "Describing something that is not deeply penetrating or thorough, and is located near or just under the surface.",
  "example": "The scratch was subsuperficial, not deep enough to cause serious damage.",
  "synonyms": ["shallow", "near-surface", "skin-deep"],
  "antonyms": ["deep", "profound", "thorough"],
  "usage": {
    "descriptive_context": [
      {
        "example": "The analysis was subsuperficial and did not address the core issues.",
        "translation": "这个分析流于表面，没有触及核心问题。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The wound was only subsuperficial.",
        "translation": "伤口只是在表皮层。"
      }
    ],
    "technical_context": [
      {
        "example": "In geology, the subsuperficial layers are those immediately beneath the topsoil.",
        "translation": "在地质学中，亚表层是指紧靠表土之下的地层。"
      }
    ]
  },
  "phrases": {
    "related_terms": [
      {
        "term": "superficial",
        "definition": "Concerned with or understanding only the surface or obvious; shallow."
      },
      {
        "term": "sub-",
        "definition": "A prefix meaning 'under' or 'below.'"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
