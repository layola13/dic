  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "非初步性的性质 (This word is highly unusual and likely constructed for illustrative purposes. A more natural expression would depend on the specific context.)",
  "definition": "The state or quality of not being rudimentary; the complex or advanced characteristics beyond basic or fundamental elements.  (This is a highly theoretical definition since the word itself is rarely, if ever, used.)",
  "example": "The nonrudimentarilynesses of quantum physics make it difficult for the average person to grasp its core concepts. (While grammatically correct, this sentence is awkward due to the unusual word choice.)",
  "synonyms": ["complexity", "sophistication", "intricacy", "elaboration", "advancement"],

  "notes": "This word is formed by adding prefixes and suffixes to 'rudimentary' to negate its meaning and then pluralizing it. It's extremely rare and mostly theoretical, used here as an example of complex word formation. It is highly unlikely to encounter this word in normal usage. Consider rephrasing the sentence using words like 'complexity', 'sophistication', or 'advanced features' for better clarity."
