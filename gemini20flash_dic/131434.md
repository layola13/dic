  "definition": "In programming, 'nonclosures' refers to variables or data structures that are not part of a closure. A closure is a function or code block that captures and encloses its surrounding state (lexical environment). Nonclosures, therefore, are elements that exist outside this captured environment and are not automatically accessible within the closure.",
  "example": "When a function uses a global variable instead of a variable from its local scope, the global variable acts as a nonclosure.",

      {
        "example": "Understanding the distinction between closures and nonclosures is crucial for debugging scope-related issues in JavaScript.",

      },
      {
        "example": "Nonclosures can sometimes lead to unintended side effects if they are modified outside the scope of the function that uses them.",

      },
      {
        "example": "Unlike closures, nonclosures do not persist through multiple invocations of the function unless they are global variables.",
        "translation": "与闭包不同，除非非闭包是全局变量，否则它们不会在函数的多次调用中持续存在。"
      }

      {
        "example": "In Python, variables from an enclosing scope that are not explicitly captured by a nested function act as nonclosures.",

      },
      {
        "example": "Nonclosure variables can be accessed in Python, but they are not part of the function's '__closure__' attribute.",
