  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "欠拟合",
  "definition": "In machine learning, underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying structure of the data, leading to poor performance on both the training and test data. It is characterized by high bias and low variance.",
  "example": "Using a linear model to fit a highly non-linear dataset will likely result in underfitting.",

      {
        "sentence": "The model's simplicity led to significant underfitting, failing to capture the complexities of the data.",

      {
        "sentence": "Underfitting can be identified when the model performs poorly even on the training dataset.",
