  "word": "anticoherer",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "反检波器",
  "definition": "An obsolete device used in early radio receivers to automatically decohere metallic filings after they had been cohered by a received signal, making the receiver ready for the next signal.",
  "example": "The anticoherer was a crucial component in early wireless telegraphy systems, ensuring continuous reception of Morse code.",
  "synonyms": [],

  "usage": {
    "historical_context": [
      {
        "example": "In the early 20th century, the anticoherer was used in conjunction with a coherer to detect radio waves.",
        "translation": "在20世纪早期，反检波器与检波器结合使用以检测无线电波。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Oliver Lodge's work on coherers and anticoherers contributed significantly to the development of radio technology.",

    "technical_description": [
      {
        "example": "The anticoherer typically used a mechanical tapper to dislodge the filings in the coherer, breaking the electrical connection.",
        "translation": "反检波器通常使用机械式分接器来移除检波器中的金属屑，从而断开电气连接。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Unlike the coherer, which required an external force to decohere, the anticoherer automated this process.",
        "translation": "与需要外力来退相干的检波器不同，反检波器使这个过程自动化。"
      }

    "obsolescence": [
      {
        "example": "The anticoherer became obsolete with the advent of more reliable and sensitive radio detection methods, such as crystal detectors and vacuum tubes.",
        "translation": "随着更可靠和灵敏的无线电检测方法（如晶体检测器和真空管）的出现，反检波器变得过时。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Although no longer in use, the anticoherer represents an important step in the history of radio communication.",
        "translation": "虽然不再使用，但反检波器代表了无线电通信历史上的一个重要步骤。"
