Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. – Steve Jobs, Stanford Commencement Address, 2005 (referring to the ephemerous nature of life)",
        "translation": "记住我很快就要死了，这是我遇到的最重要工具，它可以帮助我在生活中做出重大选择。因为几乎所有的事情——所有的外部期望、所有的骄傲、所有对尴尬或失败的恐惧——这些事情都会在死亡面前消失，只留下真正重要的东西。记住你会死，这是我知道的避免陷入认为自己有什么东西要失去的陷阱的最好方法。你已经一丝不挂了。没有理由不跟随你的内心。——史蒂夫·乔布斯，2005年斯坦福大学毕业典礼演讲（指的是生命的短暂性）"
