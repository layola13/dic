I can certainly help you create a detailed JSON format breakdown of the word "thatai" following the format you provided for "what." However, "thatai" does not appear to be a standard English word.  Assuming it might be a misspelling, a proper noun, or a word from another language, I will generate a template JSON structure.  You will need to fill in the actual data based on the true meaning and origin of the word.

Here's the JSON structure:

```json
{
  "word": "thatai",
  "phonetics": "/θəˈtaɪ/",
  "part_of_speech": "verb",
  "translation": "观察",
  "definition": "To watch carefully and attentively.",
  "example": "We thatai the birds in the forest.",
  "synonyms": ["observe", "watch", "monitor"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [
      {
        "question": "I thatai the sky every morning.",
        "translation": "我每天早上观察天空。"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
