  "part_of_speech": "adj.",
  "translation": "全卵裂的",
  "definition": "Describing cleavage (cell division) in an early embryo where the entire egg is divided into smaller cells, as opposed to meroblastic cleavage where only part of the egg is divided.",
  "example": "Amphibians and mammals exhibit holoblastic cleavage during their early development, resulting in the complete division of the egg.",
  "synonyms": ["complete cleavage", "total cleavage"],
  "antonyms": ["meroblastic"],
  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "example": "Holoblastic cleavage is a characteristic of eggs with sparse yolk, allowing for complete division.",
        "translation": "全卵裂是卵黄稀少的卵子的特征，允许完全分裂。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The type of cleavage, whether holoblastic or meroblastic, is determined by the amount and distribution of yolk in the egg.",
        "translation": "卵裂的类型，无论是全卵裂还是部分卵裂，都取决于卵子中卵黄的数量和分布。"

    "comparative_embryology": [
      {
        "example": "In comparative embryology, the presence of holoblastic cleavage can be used to infer evolutionary relationships between different species.",
        "translation": "在比较胚胎学中，全卵裂的存在可用于推断不同物种之间的进化关系。"
      },
      {
        "example": "While birds exhibit meroblastic cleavage due to their large amount of yolk, mammals, with their relatively little yolk, undergo holoblastic cleavage.",
        "translation": "虽然鸟类由于其大量的卵黄而表现出部分卵裂，但哺乳动物由于其相对较少的卵黄而进行全卵裂。"

      {
        "example": "Experimental embryologists study holoblastic cleavage to understand the mechanisms that control cell division and differentiation in early embryos.",

      {
        "example": "By manipulating the conditions during holoblastic cleavage, researchers can investigate the roles of different signaling pathways in development.",
