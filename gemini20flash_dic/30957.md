I've looked for information on the word "chakda" and, unfortunately, could not find a direct dictionary-style entry with pronunciation, part of speech, a precise definition, or usage examples in common English. It's possible that "chakda" is a word from a less common dialect, a proper noun, a technical term, or perhaps even a misspelling.

I can, however, offer you a JSON format based on my understanding of the term, assuming it is related to the Indian film "Chakda 'Xpress":

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Pronunciation:** The phonetic transcription `/ˈtʃʌkdə/` is an educated guess.
*   **Part of Speech:** I've listed it as a noun, but depending on the context, it could be part of a title or have another function.
*   **Definition and Usage:** These are based on the assumption that the user is referring to the film. If the user has another meaning in mind, the definition and usage would be different.

If you have more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to provide a more accurate analysis.
