  "definition": "A submersible is a small watercraft designed to operate underwater. The term submersible is often used to distinguish from other underwater vessels known as submarines, in that a submarine is a fully autonomous craft, capable of renewing its own power and breathing air, whereas a submersible is usually supported by a surface vessel, platform, shore team, or occasionally a larger submarine.",
