I can certainly help you with that! However, I need to point out that the word you provided, "kyanize," does not appear to be a standard English word. It's possible there's a typo, or it could be a specialized term, a brand name, or a word from another language.

Assuming that "kyanize" is the word you intended, here's a JSON format analysis based on how such a word might be treated if it *were* a standard English word. Because I don't have enough information about "kyanize," some fields will be based on educated guesses:
