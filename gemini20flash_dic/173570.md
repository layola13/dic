        "example": "If Q is a quasi-ideal of R, then for any element q in Q and r in R, the element q*r may not necessarily be in Q, but the product is 'close' in the sense that the intersection condition is satisfied.",
        "translation": "如果Q是R的拟理想，那么对于Q中的任何元素q和R中的r，元素q * r不一定在Q中，但乘积是“接近的”，因为满足了交集条件。"
