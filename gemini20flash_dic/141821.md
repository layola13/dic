  "definition": "The orbitosphenoid is a bone found in the skulls of some vertebrates. It is a cartilage bone that ossifies separately from the sphenoid. It forms the lateral wall of the optic foramen and contributes to the orbit. In mammals, it is fused to the sphenoid as the lesser wing.",
  "example": "The orbitosphenoid bone plays a crucial role in the structure of the eye socket in certain animals.",
