I am sorry, but I could not find any information for the word 'kingus.' It is possible that there is a misspelling, or that it is a highly specialized term. I can, however, provide the JSON format you requested based on the format you provided for the word "what". Please note that since the word is not found, most of the fields will be empty or based on assumptions.
