I was unable to find enough information about the word "linow" to create a comprehensive JSON object as you requested. It may be a very new word, a highly specialized term, or even a misspelling. I can, however, offer a general structure based on your example for "what", which you could then populate with any information you might have about "linow".

```json
{
  "word": "linow",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": null,
  "translation": null,
  "definition": null,
  "example": null,
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {

    "present_continuous": [],
    "present_perfect": [],
    "present_perfect_continuous": [],
    "simple_past": [],
    "past_continuous": [],
    "past_perfect": [],
    "past_perfect_continuous": [],
    "simple_future": [],

    "interrogative_sentences": [],
    "negative_sentences": []
  },
  "phrases": {

```

If you have any further details about the word "linow," please provide them, and I'll do my best to fill in the JSON object.
