I was unable to find an exact match for the word "rottas" in my dictionaries or online resources. It's possible that "rottas" is a specialized term, a proper noun, a term in another language, or simply a misspelling.

I can, however, offer a few possibilities and provide a JSON format based on these:

**1. Possible Misspelling:**

*   If "rottas" is a misspelling, could you clarify the intended word? Knowing the correct spelling would allow me to provide an accurate definition and usage examples.

**2. Specialized Term/Proper Noun:**

*   If "rottas" is a technical term or a proper noun (e.g., a company name, a place), more context would be needed to determine its meaning and provide relevant information.

**3. Word from Another Language:**

*   If "rottas" is a word from another language, specifying the language would allow me to provide a translation and definition.

In the meantime, I can create a placeholder JSON structure, but without the correct information, much of it will be based on assumptions:

```json
{
  "word": "rottas",
  "phonetics": "Unknown",
  "part_of_speech": "Unknown",
  "translation": "Unknown",
  "definition": "Definition not found. Please provide more context or verify the spelling.",
  "example": "Example not available due to lack of definition.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [],
    "present_continuous": [],
    "present_perfect": [],
    "present_perfect_continuous": [],
    "simple_past": [],
    "past_continuous": [],
    "past_perfect": [],
    "past_perfect_continuous": [],
    "simple_future": [],
    "future_continuous": [],
    "future_perfect": [],
    "future_perfect_continuous": [],
    "subjunctive_mood": [],
    "passive_voice": [],
    "interrogative_sentences": [],
    "negative_sentences": []
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [],
    "idioms": []
  }
}
```

Provide me with additional information, and I will do my best to create a detailed JSON format for "rottas"!
