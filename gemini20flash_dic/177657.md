I'll do my best to provide the JSON formatted definition for the word "recadency." However, I was unable to find a direct entry for the word "recadency" in the dictionaries and resources I consulted. It is possible that "recadency" is a very rare word, a technical term, a newly coined word, or perhaps a misspelling.

Given this situation, I can offer a couple of possibilities:

1.  **If "recadency" is related to "recadent"**: I can create a definition based on the related word "recadent," which means "recurring" or "relapsing."
2.  **A placeholder**: I can create a JSON structure with the basic fields, leaving the definition and example fields empty or filled with a "definition not found" message.

I'll proceed with the first option, creating a definition based on the likely root and meaning of "recadency," assuming it's related to recurrence or relapse. Here's the JSON structure:
