  "definition": "A pantograph is a mechanical linkage connected in a manner based on parallelograms so that the movement of one pen, when tracing an image, produces identical movements in a second pen. If a line drawing is traced by the first point, an identical, enlarged, or miniaturized copy will be drawn by a pen fixed to the other.  Also refers to an apparatus mounted on the roof of an electric locomotive, streetcar, or electric bus to collect power through contact with an overhead wire.",
