Unfortunately, I couldnâ€™t find detailed information about the word "tuma" to populate all the fields in the JSON format you provided. This could be because it's a very rare word, a proper noun, a term from a specific field, or perhaps not an English word.

If you can provide more context about the word "tuma," such as its origin, field of use, or any known meaning, I might be able to find more relevant information and complete the JSON structure accordingly.
