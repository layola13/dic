    "note": "The word 'self-awarenesses' is the plural form of 'self-awareness.' While 'self-awareness' is more commonly used in its singular, uncountable form, 'self-awarenesses' can be used to refer to multiple distinct instances, types, or aspects of self-awareness. As a plural noun, its usage is less frequent, and a specific phonetic transcription is not widely available.  When in doubt, consider rephrasing to use 'self-awareness' in a general sense or specifying the different *types* or *aspects* of self-awareness."
