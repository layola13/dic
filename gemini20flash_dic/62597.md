  "definition": "This is a hypothetical word.  It suggests a state of being enclosed or restricted by something elaborate or artificially constructed, perhaps implying a sense of confinement within an ornate but restrictive framework. Think of it as a blend of 'enclosed' and a Fénelon-esque, meticulously designed, and potentially limiting structure (this is purely imaginative). Therefore, it describes the action of being constrained or contained within something highly structured and possibly artificial or overly ornamented.",
