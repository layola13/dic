  "translation": "Physostomes",
  "definition": "A group of ray-finned fishes that have an open connection (the physostome) between the swim bladder and the gut.",

    "general_description": [
      {
        "description": "Physostomi refers to fish that have a pneumatic duct connecting their swim bladder to their gut. This connection allows them to gulp air to fill the swim bladder or to burp out air to adjust buoyancy.  The presence or absence of this duct is a key characteristic used in fish classification.",
        "translation": "Physostomi 指的是具有气动导管连接其鱼鳔和肠道的鱼类。这种连接允许它们吞咽空气来填充鱼鳔，或者通过打嗝排出空气来调节浮力。这种导管的存在与否是鱼类分类中的一个关键特征。"

    "swim_bladder_function": [
      {
        "description": "The swim bladder in physostomes functions as a hydrostatic organ, helping the fish maintain its position in the water column with minimal muscular effort. The pneumatic duct allows for rapid adjustment of the gas volume in the swim bladder.",
        "translation": "Physostomi 鱼类的鱼鳔起到静水器官的作用，帮助鱼类以最小的肌肉努力维持其在水柱中的位置。气动导管允许快速调整鱼鳔中的气体量。"

    "evolutionary_significance": [
      {
        "description": "The physostomous condition is considered ancestral in ray-finned fishes.  More derived groups have lost this connection (physoclists) and rely on gas exchange with the blood to inflate or deflate the swim bladder.",
        "translation": "在辐鳍鱼类中，具有 physostomous 结构被认为是祖先特征。更多派生的群体已经失去了这种连接（physoclisti），并依靠与血液的气体交换来充气或放气鱼鳔。"
