I am unable to provide a comprehensive analysis of the word "summerinesses" in the JSON format as requested because "summerinesses" is not a standard English word. It is a made-up word, likely formed by adding the plural suffix "-es" to the noun "summeriness," which itself is not commonly used.

While I can provide a hypothetical structure based on how such a word might be interpreted if it were real, it's important to remember that this is speculative. This analysis assumes "summeriness" refers to the quality or degree of being summery.
