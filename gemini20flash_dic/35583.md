  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "共同锚定",
  "definition": "Coanchoring refers to the process in which multiple devices or systems collaboratively establish and maintain a shared spatial reference frame. This allows these devices to accurately determine their relative positions and orientations with respect to each other, enabling coordinated actions and shared experiences in a physical space.",
  "example": "The coanchoring of multiple AR devices allowed users to collaboratively interact with virtual objects in a shared physical space.",
  "synonyms": ["spatial alignment", "collaborative localization", "shared coordinate system"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general_context": [
      {
        "example": "In robotics, coanchoring enables a team of robots to map an environment collectively.",
        "translation": "在机器人技术中，共同锚定使一组机器人能够集体绘制环境地图。"
      },
      {
        "example": "For augmented reality applications, coanchoring ensures that virtual objects are consistently placed across multiple users' devices.",
        "translation": "对于增强现实应用程序，共同锚定确保虚拟对象在多个用户的设备上一致地放置。"
