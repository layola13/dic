  "word": "splitfeet",
  "phonetics": "This word doesn't exist as a standard English word, and therefore has no standard pronunciation.",
  "part_of_speech": "Likely a noun or adjective, if it were a real word.",
  "translation": "Hypothetically, it could mean 'having split feet' or 'split feet' depending on context.",
  "definition": "This is not a standard English word. If it were, based on its construction, it might describe something that has split feet, or a condition of having split feet.  It is important to note that this is a made-up term, not a recognized part of the English lexicon.",
  "example": "Given the lack of a standard meaning, a hypothetical example: 'The creature had splitfeet, making it difficult to walk on smooth surfaces.'",
  "synonyms": ["If it described a condition: cleft foot, splayed foot. If it described an animal:  hooved, cloven-hooved (though 'splitfeet' implies more severe splitting than a normal hoof).  These are imprecise due to the word's lack of standardization."],
  "antonyms": ["If describing a condition:  normal feet, perfect feet. If describing an animal: webbed feet, single-toed feet. Again, these are imprecise due to the word's lack of standardization."],
