I couldn't find an exact match for the word "nean" in the dictionaries and resources I consulted. It is possible that "nean" is a very rare word, a proper noun, a technical term, or perhaps a misspelling.

I can, however, offer you a detailed analysis in the JSON format you requested, based on the assumption that you might have meant a different word or if you'd like to see the structure you requested. If you have another word in mind, please let me know, and I will do my best to provide the information.
