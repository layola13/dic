  "definition": "Asiphonata is a taxonomic designation previously used to classify certain groups of mollusks, specifically within the class Gastropoda (snails and slugs). The term 'asiphonata' indicates that these gastropods lack a siphon. A siphon is a tube-like structure used by some aquatic gastropods to draw water into their mantle cavity for respiration or to filter food. Gastropods in the 'Asiphonata' group typically employ other mechanisms for respiration and feeding, relying on direct diffusion or alternative feeding strategies.",
  "example": "The *Asiphonata* snails lack a siphon, relying on other methods for respiration and feeding.",
