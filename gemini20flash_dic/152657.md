  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "峰度",
  "definition": "In statistics, peakedness refers to the kurtosis of a distribution. Kurtosis is a measure of the sharpness of the peak of a frequency distribution curve. A higher kurtosis means more of the variance is due to infrequent extreme deviations, as opposed to frequent modestly-sized deviations.",
  "example": "The peakedness of the data distribution indicated a high concentration of values around the mean.",
  "synonyms": ["kurtosis", "sharpness", "pointedness"],
  "antonyms": ["flatness"],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "The peakedness of the curve was significantly higher than a normal distribution.",
        "translation": "曲线的峰度明显高于正态分布。"
      },
      {
        "example": "We analyzed the peakedness to understand the distribution's characteristics.",
        "translation": "我们分析了峰度，以了解分布的特性。"
      }

    "statistical_analysis": [
      {
        "example": "High peakedness can indicate outliers in the dataset.",
        "translation": "高峰度可能表示数据集中存在异常值。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The peakedness value is used to determine if the distribution is leptokurtic, mesokurtic, or platykurtic.",
        "translation": "峰度值用于确定分布是尖峰态、常峰态还是低峰态。"
      }

    "comparative_analysis": [
      {
        "example": "Comparing the peakedness of two distributions can reveal differences in their tail behavior.",
        "translation": "比较两个分布的峰度可以揭示它们尾部行为的差异。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The model's predictions showed a different peakedness compared to the actual data.",
        "translation": "与实际数据相比，该模型的预测显示出不同的峰度。"
      }
    ],
    "data_interpretation": [
      {
        "example": "The high peakedness suggests that extreme events are more common than expected.",
        "translation": "高峰度表明极端事件比预期更常见。"
      },
      {
        "example": "A low peakedness indicates a more uniform distribution of values.",
        "translation": "低峰度表示数值分布更均匀。"
