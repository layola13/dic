I was unable to find a definition, usage cases, or examples for the word "kinoyl." It is possible that this is not a real word, or that it is a highly specialized term not available in the resources I have access to.

I can, however, generate a JSON format for you with placeholder information, based on the format you provided for the word "what." Please note that the content will be fabricated since I lack actual data for "kinoyl."
