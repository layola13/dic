Please provide the word or words you would like me to analyze in the JSON format you specified. I need the `detections` value to proceed. For example:

```json
{
  "detections": "example_word"
}
```

Once you provide the word(s), I will create a detailed JSON object containing the word's phonetics, part of speech, translation, definition, example sentences, synonyms, antonyms, usage in different tenses, and common phrases.
