  "translation": "超粘滞性 (复数)",
  "definition": "Plural form of hyperviscosity, referring to conditions characterized by abnormally high viscosity (resistance to flow) of a fluid, especially blood.",
  "example": "The blood samples showed significant hyperviscosities, indicating a potential underlying health issue.",

  "usage": {
    "general_use": [
      {
        "context": "In medical contexts, hyperviscosities often refer to abnormally thick blood, which can impair circulation.",
        "example": "The patient's symptoms were attributed to hyperviscosities, leading to further diagnostic tests."
      },
      {
        "context": "In industrial applications, hyperviscosities might describe a fluid that has become too thick for its intended purpose.",
        "example": "The oil exhibited hyperviscosities at low temperatures, making it unsuitable for use in the machinery."

      {
        "description": "Related to conditions like polycythemia vera or Waldenström macroglobulinemia where blood becomes abnormally thick.",
        "example": "Hyperviscosities in blood can lead to increased risk of thrombosis and other cardiovascular complications."
      },
      {
        "description": "Diagnosis often involves blood tests to measure the viscosity of the blood.",
        "example": "Doctors check for hyperviscosities through specific blood tests that measure fluid thickness."
      },
      {
        "description": "Treatment may include procedures like plasmapheresis to reduce blood viscosity.",
        "example": "Plasmapheresis was used to manage the patient's hyperviscosities and alleviate symptoms."

      {
        "description": "In manufacturing, hyperviscosities in liquids like polymers or adhesives can affect processing.",
        "example": "The hyperviscosities of the polymer solution made it difficult to apply evenly to the surface."

      {
        "description": "High viscosity can affect the efficiency of machinery and equipment.",
        "example": "Engine performance declined due to hyperviscosities in the lubricant, causing increased friction."
      },
      {
        "description": "Adjustments in temperature or chemical composition may be necessary to manage hyperviscosities in industrial fluids.",
        "example": "Heating the fluid helped reduce hyperviscosities, making it easier to pump through the system."
