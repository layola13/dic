  "definition": "In linguistics, markedness refers to the way certain elements (sounds, words, grammatical features, etc.) are more prominent or relatively complex compared to other elements. The more common or basic elements are considered 'unmarked,' while the less common or more complex ones are 'marked.' Markedness is often related to frequency and distribution, where unmarked elements tend to be more frequent and appear in a wider range of contexts.",
  "example": "The concept of markedness helps linguists analyze the structure and function of language by identifying the relative complexity and prominence of different linguistic features. For example, in many languages, the plural form of a noun is marked, while the singular form is unmarked.",
