  "word": "quasi-gly",
  "phonetics": "No standard phonetic transcription available.  Likely /ˌkwaːzaɪ ˈɡlaɪ/ or similar.",
  "part_of_speech": "Likely a prefix combined with a root. Requires context for full determination.",
  "translation": "类-甘油 (implied meaning)",
  "definition": "This is not a standard, well-defined word in English. It appears to be a combination of the prefix 'quasi-' meaning 'resembling' or 'seemingly' and 'gly', likely shortened from 'glycerol' or related to glycolipids or glycoproteins. Without specific context, it implies a substance or structure that is similar to or related to glycerol, glycolipids, or glycoproteins.",
  "example": "Within the research paper, 'quasi-gly' referred to a synthetic compound with glycerol-like properties.",
