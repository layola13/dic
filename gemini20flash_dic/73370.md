  "word": "foregoneness's",
  "phonetics": "No standard phonetic transcription available. This is a rare and somewhat artificial construct.",
  "part_of_speech": "Noun (possessive form)",
  "translation": "属于已经被预料或放弃的事物的状态/特征",
  "definition": "This word is a complex construct. It's the possessive form of 'foregoneness', which is itself derived from 'foregone'.  It implies something already anticipated or yielded, and then denotes the *ownership* or *characteristic* of that state. It's unlikely to be encountered in common usage.",
  "example": "The foregoneness's impact on the company was undeniable; their acceptance of defeat had permeated every aspect of their strategy. (This is an unnatural and forced example; it's difficult to use 'foregoneness's' in a natural way.)",
  "synonyms": [
    "expectedness's",
    "anticipatedness's",
    "inevitability's (related, but stronger)",
    "abandonment's (if implying giving something up)"
  ],
  "antonyms": [
    "unexpectedness's",
    "improbability's",
    "novelty's",
    "surprise's"
  ],
  "usage": {
    "explanation": "This word is highly unusual and not recommended for general use. It's a theoretical construct created by adding '-ness' to 'foregone' to create a noun, then adding '- 's' to indicate possession.  Its meaning is highly context-dependent and difficult to convey concisely. It would likely be better to rephrase a sentence to avoid using it altogether.",
    "problems": [
      "Awkwardness: The word itself sounds unnatural.",
      "Rarity:  It is extremely rare in English.",
      "Ambiguity:  The exact meaning is not immediately clear.",
      "Better Alternatives: Almost always, there are clearer and more concise ways to express the same idea."
    ],
    "examples_to_avoid": [
      {
        "sentence": "The project failed due to the foregoneness's influence.",
        "reason": "Unclear and awkward. Better: 'The project failed because of the influence of what they had already given up on/accepted as inevitable.'"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "We could feel the foregoneness's weight upon us.",
        "reason": "Poetic but still unnatural. Better: 'We felt the weight of their acceptance of defeat pressing down on us.'"
      }
    ],
    "rephrasing_examples":[
      {
        "original": "The foregoneness's effect was evident in their lack of enthusiasm",
        "rephrased": "The effect of their prior acceptance of defeat was evident in their lack of enthusiasm.",
        "reason": "Uses a more natural phrasing to convey the meaning of what was 'foregone'."
      },
      {
        "original": "The foregoneness's implications were far reaching.",
        "rephrased": "The implications of their prior concessions were far-reaching.",
        "reason": "Clearer and more direct way of expressing the idea using 'concessions' as a proxy to that which was foregone."
