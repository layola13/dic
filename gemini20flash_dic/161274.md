  "definition": "Postmultiplication is a mathematical operation, specifically in the context of matrices or other algebraic structures, where a given element is multiplied by another element from the right-hand side. In matrix algebra, if you have a matrix A and you postmultiply it by a matrix B, the operation is represented as A * B. The order of multiplication matters, so postmultiplication is distinct from premultiplication (where you multiply from the left, B * A).",
  "example": "In the equation A * B = C, matrix A is postmultiplied by matrix B.",

        "example": "When dealing with matrices, postmultiplication by a transformation matrix can apply a series of transformations to the original matrix.",
