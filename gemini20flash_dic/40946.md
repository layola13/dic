I've done my best to analyze the word "coopee" in a similar format to the example you provided. However, it seems that "coopee" might be a misspelling or a less common word, as I couldn't find a direct translation or a widely recognized definition for it.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Misspelling:** It's possible that "coopee" is a misspelling of "coop." If this is the case, you should use "coop" instead.
*   **Context:** The meaning of "coopee" (if it's a real word) could heavily depend on the context in which it's used.
*   **Specialized Term:** It could be a term used in a specific industry, hobby, or region.

If you have more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to provide a more accurate analysis.
