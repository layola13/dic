  "translation": "木栓形成层",
  "definition": "A single layer of meristematic cells that divide periclinally to produce the phellem (cork) to the outside and the phelloderm to the inside. It is responsible for secondary growth in plants, specifically the formation of the periderm.",
  "example": "The phellogen is essential for the formation of the protective outer layer of the bark.",
  "synonyms": ["cork cambium"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "The activity of the phellogen results in the thickening of the periderm, providing insulation and protection to the underlying tissues.",
        "translation": "木栓形成层的活动导致周皮增厚，为下层组织提供绝缘和保护。"
      },
      {
        "example": "In woody plants, the phellogen arises in the outer cortex and forms the cork layer.",

      {
        "example": "Unlike the vascular cambium, the phellogen produces cells only in two directions: outwards as cork and inwards as phelloderm.",
        "translation": "与维管形成层不同，木栓形成层仅在两个方向上产生细胞：向外形成栓皮，向内形成栓皮层。"

        "example": "The depth at which phellogen forms can vary among different plant species, influencing the bark's characteristics.",

      },
      {
        "example": "In response to injury, the phellogen can produce wound periderm to seal off the damaged area.",
