  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "单应性",
  "definition": "A homography is a projective transformation between two planes. It is a linear transformation in projective space, represented by a 3x3 matrix, that maps points from one plane to corresponding points on another plane. This transformation preserves collinearity, meaning that points lying on a line in one plane will also lie on a line in the other plane after the transformation.",
  "example": "In computer vision, homography is often used to relate different views of a scene, such as aligning images or estimating camera motion.",
