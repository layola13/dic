  "word": "eutrophy",
  "phonetics": "/juːˈtrɒfɪ/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "富营养化",
  "definition": "The process by which a body of water acquires a high concentration of nutrients, especially phosphates and nitrates. These typically promote excessive growth of algae. As the algae die and decompose, high levels of organic matter and the decomposing organisms deplete the water of available oxygen, causing the death of other organisms, such as fish.",
  "example": "The eutrophication of the lake was caused by excessive fertilizer runoff from nearby farms.",
  "synonyms": [
    "eutrophication",
    "nutrient enrichment",
    "algal bloom"
  ],
  "antonyms": [
    "oligotrophy"
  ],
  "usage": {
    "general_context": [
      {
        "example": "Eutrophy can lead to significant disruptions in aquatic ecosystems.",
        "translation": "富营养化会导致水生生态系统的重大破坏。"

      {
        "example": "The excessive use of fertilizers in agriculture is a major contributor to eutrophy in many water bodies.",

      {
        "example": "Eutrophy is often measured by assessing the levels of chlorophyll-a in the water, which indicates algal biomass.",

      {
        "example": "The primary cause of eutrophy is nutrient pollution, which leads to algal blooms and oxygen depletion.",

      {
        "example": "Controlling eutrophy involves reducing nutrient inputs and restoring natural water filtration processes.",
