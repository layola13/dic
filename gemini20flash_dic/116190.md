  "translation": "麦芽浆；麦芽糖化过程",
  "definition": "The process of combining a mix of ground grains (typically malted barley along with supplementary grains such as corn, sorghum, rye or wheat) and water, and heating this \"mash\" in a process called \"mashing\". Mashing allows enzymes in the malt to break down the starch in the grain into sugars, most importantly maltose. Mashing involves pauses at certain temperatures (notably 45-52 °C, 62-68 °C and 76-78 °C), and takes place in a \"mash tun\" – an insulated brewing vessel with a false bottom.",
  "example": "The mashings are then separated into the wort, which is fermented, and the spent grain.",
