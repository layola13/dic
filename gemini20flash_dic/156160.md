  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "向光性",
  "definition": "The orientation of a plant or other organism in response to light, either towards the source of light (positive phototropism) or away from it (negative phototropism).",
  "example": "The bending of a stem towards a window is an example of positive phototropism.",
  "synonyms": [
    "heliotropism"

  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "Phototropism allows plants to maximize their exposure to sunlight for photosynthesis.",
        "translation": "向光性使植物能够最大限度地暴露在阳光下进行光合作用。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Experiments have shown that phototropism is controlled by the hormone auxin.",
        "translation": "实验表明，向光性是由植物激素生长素控制的。"

    "scientific_context": [
      {
        "example": "Research on phototropism contributes to our understanding of plant development and responses to environmental stimuli.",
        "translation": "对向光性的研究有助于我们理解植物的发育和对环境刺激的反应。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The molecular mechanisms underlying phototropism are complex and involve photoreceptors like phototropins.",
        "translation": "向光性的分子机制是复杂的，涉及到像趋光蛋白这样的光感受器。"

      {
        "example": "Students often study phototropism in biology class by observing the growth of seedlings under different lighting conditions.",

     "common_mistakes": [
        {
          "mistake": "Confusing phototropism with photosynthesis.",
          "explanation": "Phototropism is the directional growth response to light, while photosynthesis is the process of converting light energy into chemical energy.",
          "correction": "Remember that phototropism is about directional growth, not energy production."
        },
        {
          "mistake": "Assuming all plants exhibit the same degree of phototropism.",
          "explanation": "Different plants exhibit different levels of phototropism based on species and environmental conditions.",
          "correction": "Understand that the extent of phototropism varies among plant species."
