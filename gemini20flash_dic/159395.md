I'll do my best to provide a detailed JSON format analysis for the word "polans," similar to the example you gave for "what." However, it seems "polans" is not a standard English word. I will proceed assuming it might be a proper noun, a misspelling, or a technical term, and I'll include possible analyses based on these assumptions.

```json
{
  "word": "polans",
  "phonetics": "/ˈpoʊlənz/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun (assumed)",
  "translation": "Possible interpretations:",
  "definition": "Since 'polans' is not a standard English word, here are a few possibilities:\n\n1.  **Plural form of a possible proper noun 'Polan':** Could refer to a person's name or a place name.\n2.  **Misspelling:** Could be a misspelling of 'Poland' or another similar-sounding word.\n3.  **Technical Term:** May be a specific term in a field (e.g., science, technology, or a specific industry). Without further context, it's hard to determine the exact meaning.",
