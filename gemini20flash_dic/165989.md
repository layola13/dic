Please provide the word(s) you would like me to analyze in the JSON format you specified. I need the `prepastes` value to proceed. For example, you can provide a word like this:

```json
{
  "prepastes": "example"
}
```

Once you provide the word, I will create a detailed JSON object similar to the "what" example you gave, including:

*   `word`: The word itself.
*   `phonetics`: The phonetic transcription of the word.
*   `part_of_speech`: The word's part of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
*   `translation`: A basic Chinese translation of the word.
*   `definition`: A definition of the word.
*   `example`: Example sentences using the word.
*   `synonyms`: Synonyms for the word.
*   `antonyms`: Antonyms for the word (if applicable).
*   `usage`: Example sentences in various tenses and grammatical structures, with Chinese translations.
*   `phrases`: Common phrases and idioms using the word, with Chinese translations.
