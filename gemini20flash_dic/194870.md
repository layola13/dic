    "mathematics": [
      {
        "context": "In mathematics, a semi-convergent series or sequence exhibits behavior that initially appears convergent but ultimately does not fully converge to a single value.",
        "example": "The series was initially promising, showing a decrease in terms, but it proved to be only semi-convergent when tested rigorously."

    "physics": [
      {
        "context": "In optics, a semi-convergent lens may focus light rays to a point, but with some aberrations or imperfections preventing a perfect focus.",
        "example": "The design of the lens aimed for convergence, but the result was a semi-convergent beam due to limitations in manufacturing precision."

      {
        "context": "Used metaphorically to describe processes or situations that move towards a specific outcome but do not fully achieve it.",
