**A few notes on the structure and content:**

*   **phonetics**: I did my best to provide a plausible phonetic transcription.
*   **part\_of\_speech**: "Linkwork" is primarily a noun.
*   **translation**: I provided a common Chinese translation.
*   **usage**: I've created example sentences that demonstrate "linkwork" in various tenses and grammatical structures, along with their Chinese translations.  I've also added examples with passive voice and modal verbs.
*   **phrases**: I included some common phrases using "linkwork."
*   **idioms**:  "Linkwork" is not commonly used in idioms, so that section remains empty.
