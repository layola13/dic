  "definition": "Plesiohedrons are space-filling polyhedra where all faces are equivalent under the symmetries of the space-filling. They represent a special class of polyhedra that can fill space in a repeating pattern, with all their faces being symmetrically identical within that pattern.",
  "example": "Plesiohedrons are studied in the context of tessellations and crystal structures.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "context": "In geometry and crystallography, plesiohedrons are used to describe the shapes of cells in space-filling arrangements.",
        "example": "The study of plesiohedrons helps in understanding the possible shapes that can form a uniform tessellation of space."
      },
      {
        "context": "When discussing the structure of crystals, plesiohedrons can represent the shapes of the repeating units.",
        "example": "Certain crystal structures can be described using plesiohedrons as the fundamental building blocks."

    "mathematical_context": [
      {
        "context": "In mathematical contexts, plesiohedrons are analyzed for their symmetry properties and their ability to fill space without gaps or overlaps.",
        "example": "The analysis of plesiohedrons involves group theory and the study of crystallographic groups."

      {
        "context": "Plesiohedrons are a generalization of parallelepipeds, which are a simple example of space-filling polyhedra.",
        "example": "Unlike parallelepipeds, plesiohedrons can have more complex face shapes while still maintaining the space-filling property."
