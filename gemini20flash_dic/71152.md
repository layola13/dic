  "word": "fissigemmation",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "通过裂殖进行繁殖",
  "definition": "A form of asexual reproduction, a type of fission, where new cells are formed as outgrowths or buds on the surface of the parent cell. After the initial formation, these buds detach and mature into independent cells. This process is common in certain microorganisms, like some bacteria and yeasts.",
  "example": "Fissigemmation is a reproductive strategy employed by some yeast species to rapidly increase their population size under favorable conditions.",
