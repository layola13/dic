I am sorry, but I am unable to locate the definition, phonetics, or usage of the word "hairbird" in any dictionary or language resource. It's possible that "hairbird" is not a recognized word in the English language, or it could be a very specialized term. I can, however, provide you with the JSON format you requested using a placeholder for the word itself.

```json
{
  "word": "hairbird",
  "phonetics": "N/A",
  "part_of_speech": "N/A",
  "translation": "N/A",
  "definition": "N/A",
  "example": "N/A",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {},
  "phrases": {}
}
```

If you have more information about the context in which you encountered this word, or if it might be a term from a specific field, please let me know, and I can try searching again with that additional information.
