I was unable to find the word "frampel" in any dictionaries or online resources. It is possible that this is a newly created word, a very specialized term, or simply a misspelling. I can, however, create a JSON structure for you based on the template you provided, but the content will be mostly generic since I lack specific information about the word "frampel."
