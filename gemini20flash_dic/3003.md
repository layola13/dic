  "notes": "Because 'aep' is an abbreviation, its meaning depends heavily on the context. If used in a discussion about audio production, it likely refers to an 'Audio Engineering Project'. If used when talking about video or motion graphics editing, it might refer to an Adobe After Effects Project file. Without context, its meaning is ambiguous. The phonetic transcription is an approximation based on how it *might* be pronounced if spelled out (A-E-P)."
