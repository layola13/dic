I'm sorry, but I was unable to find any information about the word "kapmoth." It is possible that it is a misspelling, a less common word, or a technical term not available in my current knowledge base.

If it is a misspelling, here are some possible corrections with definitions in the format you requested:

```json

    "phonetics": "/kæf/",
    "part_of_speech": "noun",

        }
      ]
    },

  {
    "word": "calmth",
    "phonetics": "/kɑːmθ/",
    "part_of_speech": "noun",

    "definition": "The state of being peaceful, quiet, and without worry.",

    "antonyms": ["agitation", "excitement", "turmoil"],
    "usage": {
      "general": [
        {
          "example": "The calmth of the countryside is very relaxing.",
          "translation": "乡村的平静非常令人放松。"
        }
      ]
    },
    "phrases": {}
  }
]
```

If "kapmoth" is indeed the correct spelling, could you please provide more context, so I can find the correct definition and usage examples?
