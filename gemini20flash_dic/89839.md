  "translation": "小火山；熔岩丘",
  "definition": "A small, steep-sided volcanic cone formed on a lava flow surface. Hornitos are formed by the escape of gases through an opening in the cooling lava, leading to the accumulation of molten material around the vent.",

  "usage": {
    "descriptive": [
      {
        "example": "The hornito, a miniature volcano, stood as a testament to the area's volcanic activity.",

      {
        "example": "Steam and gases vented from the hornito, a common sight in the volcanic field.",

      {
        "example": "Compared to the main crater, the hornito was a minor feature, but still fascinating.",

      {
        "example": "These hornitos are smaller and steeper than the spatter cones found in other volcanic regions.",
        "translation": "这些熔岩丘比在其他火山地区发现的火山渣锥更小更陡峭。"

    "location": [
      {
        "example": "The hornito was located on the surface of a recently solidified lava flow.",
        "translation": "熔岩丘位于最近凝固的熔岩流的表面。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Several hornitos were clustered together, indicating a zone of intense degassing.",

    "formation": [
      {
        "example": "The hornito formed as gases escaping from the lava carried molten material upwards.",
        "translation": "当从熔岩中逸出的气体将熔融物质向上携带时，便形成了熔岩丘。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Over time, the hornito grew taller as more lava accumulated around the vent.",
        "translation": "随着越来越多的熔岩在喷口周围积聚，熔岩丘随着时间的推移而长高。"
