**Notes:**

*   **Hypothetical Nature:** This analysis is based on a hypothetical understanding of "outrows" since it's not a standard English word. The definitions and usages are inferred.
*   **Context:** The interpretations lean towards a context of data processing, spreadsheets, or databases, where rows might extend beyond expected boundaries.
*   **JSON Structure:** The structure strictly adheres to the format you provided.
*   **Translation:** The translations are based on the hypothetical meanings.
*   **Adaptation:** If you have a specific context for "outrows," the definitions and examples can be adapted to fit that context more accurately.
*   **Pronunciation:** The pronunciation is based on the likely way the word would be pronounced if it were a standard English word.
