  "translation": "氧合血蓝蛋白",
  "definition": "Oxyhemocyanin is the oxygenated form of hemocyanin, a respiratory protein found in some arthropods and mollusks, analogous to hemoglobin in vertebrates. It is responsible for transporting oxygen in the hemolymph (blood) of these animals. When oxygenated, it gives the hemolymph a blue color.",
  "example": "The blue color of the horseshoe crab's blood is due to the presence of oxyhaemocyanin.",
