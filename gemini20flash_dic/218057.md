    "general_contexts": [
      {
        "context": "In zoology and paleontology, Teleostomi is used to classify a broad group of fish that share key skeletal features.",

      {
        "context": "In comparative anatomy, the features of Teleostomi, such as the operculum, are important for understanding respiratory mechanisms in fish.",
        "example": "The operculum in Teleostomi efficiently pumps water over the gills, facilitating gas exchange."
