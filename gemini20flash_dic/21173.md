Please provide the word you would like me to analyze in the JSON format. I need the word to proceed. For example, you can send me:

```json
{
  "blobbed": "example_word"
}
```

Once you provide the word, I will create a detailed JSON object similar to the "what" example, including phonetics, part of speech, translation, definition, example sentences, synonyms, antonyms, usage in different tenses, and common phrases/idioms.
