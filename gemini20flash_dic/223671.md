I was unable to find a direct translation or definition for the word "transmuscles." It is possible that this word is highly technical, newly coined, or specific to a particular field.

However, I can offer a possible interpretation based on its components:

*   **"Trans-"**: A prefix meaning "across," "beyond," or "changing."
*   **"Muscles"**: Refers to bodily tissues that contract to produce movement.

Therefore, "transmuscles" could potentially refer to:

*   Muscles that span across a certain area.
*   Muscles that facilitate a change or transformation.
