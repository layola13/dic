  "translation": "弹性蛋白",
  "definition": "Elastins are a family of insoluble structural proteins that are responsible for the elasticity of vertebrate connective tissues. They are highly elastic and allow tissues in the body to resume their shape after stretching or contracting. Elastin is a crucial component of tissues such as skin, blood vessels, lungs, and ligaments.",
  "example": "Elastins in the skin provide it with the ability to stretch and return to its original shape.",
