    "origin": [
      {
        "explanation": "The exact origin is debated, but it is often associated with World War II pilots. If a pilot crashed and died, it was said they 'bought the farm,' implying that their life insurance money would be used to pay off the mortgage on a farm. Another theory suggests it comes from the idea that soldiers who died were given a plot of land in the afterlife.",
        "translation": "关于这个习语的确切来源尚有争议，但通常与第二次世界大战的飞行员有关。如果一名飞行员坠毁身亡，人们会说他们“买了农场”，这意味着他们的人寿保险金将用于偿还农场的抵押贷款。另一种理论认为，它源于这样一种想法，即死去的士兵在死后会被给予一块土地。"
