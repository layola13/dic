  "etymology": {
    "origin": "The term 'ticky-tacky' was popularized by the singer Malvina Reynolds in her 1962 song 'Little Boxes,' which satirized the conformity of suburban housing developments. The exact origin of the word is uncertain, but it likely combines 'ticky,' suggesting something small or insignificant, with 'tacky,' meaning cheap or in poor taste.",
    "usage_notes": "The word is primarily used in American English. It conveys a sense of uniformity, cheapness, and lack of originality. It is often used to describe mass-produced items, especially houses, decorations, and souvenirs, that are considered to be of low quality and lacking in aesthetic appeal."
