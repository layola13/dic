I am sorry, but I was unable to find enough reliable information online to provide a detailed breakdown of the word "anra" in the requested JSON format. This could be due to the word being less common, a proper noun, or perhaps a term specific to a certain field or language that isn't widely documented in the resources I have access to. I can, however, offer you a JSON structure with some placeholder information, which you can then fill in with more accurate details if you have them.

```json

  "word": "anra",
