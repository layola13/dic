  "definition": "In the context of the planet Mars, 'cimer' refers to a relatively thin layer of frost that is formed on the surface, typically composed of water ice or carbon dioxide ice. These frosts can appear and disappear with changes in temperature and atmospheric conditions.",
  "example": "The HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has captured images of cimer frost formations in the high latitudes of Mars.",

      {
        "sentence": "During the Martian winter, cimer frost blankets the polar regions, altering the landscape's appearance.",
