  "definition": "A refining process in metallurgy, where metallic ores or metals are treated under very high temperatures and have controlled operations to separate noble metals, like gold and silver, from base metals, like lead, copper, zinc, arsenic, antimony, or tellurium. The process is based on the principle that precious metals do not oxidize or react chemically, unlike base metals; when they are heated at high temperatures, the precious metals remain apart, and the base metals react and form slags or other compounds.",
