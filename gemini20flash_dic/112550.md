  "definition": "Augusta Ada King, Countess of Lovelace (1815-1852) was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She is often regarded as the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine; as such, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.",
