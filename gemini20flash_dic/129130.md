  "definition": "Nuclear magnetic resonance: a spectroscopic technique used to observe local magnetic fields around atomic nuclei. The sample is placed in a magnetic field and the NMR signal is produced by excitation of the nuclei sample with radio waves into nuclear magnetic resonance, which results in emission of radio waves at a characteristic frequency which depends on the local magnetic field. This allows to deduce the chemical structure of the sample molecule.",
  "example": "NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool for identifying the structure of organic molecules.",
