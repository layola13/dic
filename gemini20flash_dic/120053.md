I was unable to find enough information about the word "millree" to create a comprehensive JSON object as requested. It may not be a recognized English word. I can only provide a JSON object with limited information.

```json
{
  "word": "millree",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": null,
  "translation": null,
  "definition": "Unable to find a definition for the word 'millree'. It might be a misspelling or a rare word.",
  "example": null,
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {},
  "phrases": {}
}
