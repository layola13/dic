I am sorry, but I could not find enough information to create a comprehensive JSON object for the word "prefriendships" following the example you provided. The word "prefriendships" is not a standard or widely recognized English word. It's possible that it's a neologism (a newly coined word) or a very specialized term not yet included in common dictionaries and linguistic resources.

Here is a basic structure based on the example, but it's very limited due to the lack of available information:

```json
{
  "word": "prefriendships",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": "noun (likely)",
  "translation": "友谊之前",
  "definition": "The period or state existing before a friendship is established.",
  "example": "The awkward stage of getting to know someone can be described as prefriendships.",
  "synonyms": ["pre-acquaintanceship", "early acquaintances"],
  "antonyms": ["friendships"],
   "usage": {
    "general_examples": [
      {
        "sentence": "The nuances of prefriendships can be delicate and require careful navigation.",
        "translation": "友谊之前的细微之处可能很微妙，需要仔细处理。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "Many people enjoy the exciting possibilities inherent in prefriendships.",
        "translation": "许多人享受友谊之前固有的令人兴奋的可能性。"
      }
    ]
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [],
    "idioms": []
  }
}
