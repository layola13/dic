  "definition": "This word is a non-standard comparative form of 'prior.' While 'prior' already implies a comparison (earlier in time or order), 'priorer' attempts to intensify this comparison. It's generally considered incorrect in formal English. It is sometimes used informally to emphasize that something is earlier or more important than something else.",
  "example": "While not standard, one might say, 'This task is priorer than that one,' to emphasize its higher priority.",
