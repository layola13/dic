  "definition": "Existimation is a concept that blends 'existence' and 'estimation.'

It's particularly relevant when precise measurement is difficult or impossible, requiring one to estimate qualities, quantities, or states of being.",
  "example": "The existimation of natural resources in a protected area involves estimating the quantity and value of resources present, despite challenges in accessing and measuring them directly.",
