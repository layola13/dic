  "word": "slaglessnesses",
  "phonetics": "No standard phonetics available, derived from root words.",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "The state or quality of being without slag; the condition of lacking slag.",
  "definition": "Plural form of slaglessness. Slaglessness refers to the absence of slag, which is a glassy, cinder-like material that is a byproduct of smelting or welding processes. Slag is typically composed of impurities that float to the top of the molten metal and solidify upon cooling. Therefore, slaglessness indicates a state of purity or refinement in a material or process, where slag is not present.",
  "example": "The slaglessnesses of the new welding technique resulted in stronger, cleaner joints.",
  "synonyms": ["purity", "cleanliness", "refinement", "absence of impurities"],
  "antonyms": ["slaggy", "impurity", "contamination"],
