  "definition": "While the term 'subequalities' isn't standard in mathematics, it likely refers to a set of inequalities that are less significant or derived from a primary set of inequalities. It could also refer to inequalities within a specific subset or sub-problem of a larger mathematical problem.",
  "example": "When solving complex optimization problems, mathematicians often deal with subequalities to simplify the process.",

  "antonyms": ["main inequalities", "primary inequalities"],

      {
        "example": "In the context of optimization, subequalities can refer to constraints that are less critical but still necessary for a feasible solution.",
        "translation": "在优化的上下文中，次等不等式可以指那些不那么重要但对于可行解仍然必要的约束。"
      },

        "example": "When analyzing a system of equations, subequalities might emerge as a consequence of applying certain transformations or simplifications.",
