  "translation": "多边形组",
  "definition": "In computer graphics and 3D modeling, polygroups refer to a collection or grouping of polygons (faces) within a 3D model. These groups are often created to facilitate easier selection, manipulation, and organization of different parts of the model.",
  "example": "The artist used polygroups to separate the character's armor into distinct, manageable sections.",
  "synonyms": ["polygon groups", "face groups", "element groups"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "description": "Polygroups are commonly used in 3D modeling software to manage complex models by dividing them into logical sections.",
        "example": "Using polygroups, the designer could quickly select and modify all the polygons belonging to the car's door."

      {
        "description": "They enable efficient workflows for texturing, sculpting, and applying different materials to specific parts of a 3D object.",
        "example": "The texturing artist assigned different materials to each polygroup, making the process much faster."

    "sculpting": [
      {
        "description": "In digital sculpting, polygroups allow artists to isolate areas for detailed work without affecting the rest of the model.",
        "example": "The sculptor used polygroups to define the muscles on the character's arm, making it easier to add fine details."
      },
      {
        "description": "They are useful for maintaining clean edges and boundaries when applying brushes and deformations.",
        "example": "By using polygroups, the artist ensured that the changes to the collar did not bleed into the neck area."

    "texturing": [
      {
        "description": "Polygroups simplify the UV unwrapping process by allowing you to unwrap different parts of the model separately.",

      },
      {
        "description": "They make it easier to assign different texture sets and materials to different parts of the model.",
        "example": "Each polygroup was assigned a unique material, which allowed for a detailed and varied texture."

    "animation": [
      {
        "description": "Polygroups can be used to define different parts of a character or object that will be rigged and animated separately.",
