I couldn't find enough information about the word "learnedness's" to create a detailed JSON object with usage examples, synonyms, and antonyms. It appears to be a rare or non-standard form. The word "learnedness" itself refers to the state of having or demonstrating much knowledge or learning. The addition of "'s" usually indicates possession or belonging to something associated with learnedness.

Here's a basic JSON structure with the information I could gather:
