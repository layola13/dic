  "definition": "A firestorm is a large fire which attains such intensity that it creates and sustains its own wind system. It is most commonly a natural phenomenon created during some of the largest bushfires and wildfires. Although the term has been used for any large fire, the phenomenon's determining characteristic is a fire with its own wind, which is drawn in from all points of the compass towards the fire's center. Firestorms are characterized by strong, inward-spiraling surface winds that increase in velocity as they approach the fire's core and strong updrafts of heated air and combustion products. This creates a self-sustaining system, with fire-induced winds supplying the fire with oxygen.",
