  "definition": "The plural form of iridium, a chemical element with the symbol Ir and atomic number 77. It is a very hard, brittle, silvery-white transition metal of the platinum group. Iridium is one of the densest elements and is the most corrosion-resistant metal, even at temperatures as high as 2000 °C. It is used in various alloys, electrical contacts, and as a catalyst.",
