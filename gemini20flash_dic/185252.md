  "definition": "In psychoanalysis, retransference refers to the redirection of a patient's feelings from a significant person in their past (such as a parent) onto the psychoanalyst. It is a phenomenon where the patient unconsciously repeats patterns of relating from earlier relationships in the therapeutic relationship. These feelings can be positive, negative, or ambivalent. Retransference is considered a valuable tool in psychoanalysis, as it allows the analyst to gain insight into the patient's past relationships and unresolved conflicts. By understanding and working through the retransference, the patient can develop a greater understanding of themselves and their relationships.",
  "example": "During the therapy session, the patient's retransferences became evident as they began to idealize the therapist, similar to how they once viewed their father.",
