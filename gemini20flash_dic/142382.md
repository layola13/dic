  "word": "orthoselection",
  "phonetics": "/ˌɔːrθoʊsɪˈlekʃən/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "正向选择；定向选择",
  "definition": "Orthoselection refers to a hypothetical evolutionary trend where there is selection pressure that consistently favors changes in a particular direction. This implies that evolution proceeds in a straight line towards a specific goal or direction, an idea that is largely discredited in modern evolutionary biology.",
  "example": "The concept of orthoselection was once used to explain linear trends in the fossil record, but it is now understood that such trends are better explained by other mechanisms, such as adaptation to gradually changing environments.",
  "synonyms": ["directional selection", "linear evolution (discredited)"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general_context": [
      {
        "example": "Early evolutionary biologists proposed orthoselection to account for apparent trends in the fossil record.",
        "translation": "早期的进化生物学家提出正向选择来解释化石记录中明显的趋势。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The idea of orthoselection is now largely rejected in favor of more nuanced explanations of evolutionary change.",
        "translation": "正向选择的观点现在很大程度上被否定，取而代之的是对进化变化更为细致的解释。"
      }
    ],
    "historical_context": [
      {
        "example": "Orthoselection was part of the broader concept of orthogenesis, which suggested that evolution has an intrinsic directionality.",
        "translation": "正向选择是正生论这一更广泛概念的一部分，后者认为进化具有内在的方向性。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Although orthoselection is not a mainstream concept today, understanding its history provides insight into the development of evolutionary thought.",
        "translation": "尽管正向选择今天不是一个主流概念，但了解它的历史可以深入了解进化思想的发展。"
      }
    ],
    "scientific_critique": [
      {
        "example": "Critics of orthoselection argue that it implies a predetermined goal in evolution, which contradicts the understanding of natural selection as a response to environmental pressures.",
        "translation": "正向选择的批评者认为，它暗示了进化中一个预先确定的目标，这与将自然选择理解为对环境压力的反应相矛盾。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Modern evolutionary theory explains long-term trends through the interaction of mutation, selection, and other factors, rather than a fixed directional force like orthoselection.",
        "translation": "现代进化理论通过突变、选择和其他因素的相互作用来解释长期趋势，而不是像正向选择这样固定的方向性力量。"
