        "description": "The albertype process involves exposing a gelatin layer sensitized with potassium dichromate under a negative. The gelatin hardens proportionally to the amount of light received, and the unhardened gelatin is washed away. Ink is then applied to the hardened gelatin, which absorbs it in proportion to the hardening, allowing for continuous-tone printing.",
        "translation": "阿尔贝照相法涉及在负片下曝光用重铬酸钾敏化的明胶层。 明胶硬化的程度与接收到的光量成正比，未硬化的明胶被洗掉。 然后将墨水涂在硬化的明胶上，明胶根据硬化程度吸收墨水，从而实现连续色调印刷。"
