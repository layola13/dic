I was unable to find an exact match for the word "tettix" in the dictionaries and resources I consulted. It is possible that this is a highly specialized term, a misspelling, or a word that is not widely recognized in standard English dictionaries. I can, however, create a JSON format as you provided for other words.

```json
{
  "word": "tettix",
  "phonetics": "Could not find standard phonetics",
  "part_of_speech": "Unknown",
  "translation": "Unable to provide a standard translation",
  "definition": "Definition not found in standard dictionaries.",
  "example": "Example usage not found due to the unknown nature of the word.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {},
  "phrases": {}
}
```
