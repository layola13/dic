  "translation": "钯试剂",
  "definition": "Palladia is a trade name for a form of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) that is co-immobilized with copper(I) iodide on carbon. It is used as a heterogeneous catalyst in chemical reactions, particularly in cross-coupling reactions. It offers advantages in terms of ease of handling and recovery compared to homogeneous catalysts.",
