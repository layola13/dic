  "word": "metamictness",
  "phonetics": "/ˌmetəˈmɪktnəs/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "非晶性",
  "definition": "The state or condition of a mineral that has lost its crystalline structure and become amorphous due to the destructive effects of its own radioactivity.",
  "example": "The metamictness of zircon samples can vary depending on their age and uranium content.",
  "synonyms": ["amorphization", "disordering"],
  "antonyms": ["crystallinity"],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "context": "In mineralogy, metamictness is used to describe minerals that were originally crystalline but have been altered to an amorphous state.",
        "example": "Due to the presence of radioactive elements, some minerals exhibit metamictness over geological time scales."
      },
      {
        "context": "The degree of metamictness can affect the physical properties of a mineral, such as its density and refractive index.",
        "example": "Highly metamict zircons are often less dense and have a lower refractive index compared to their crystalline counterparts."
      }
    ],
    "scientific_context": [
      {
        "context": "Researchers use techniques like X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy to study the metamictness of minerals.",
        "example": "X-ray diffraction patterns of metamict minerals show broad, diffuse peaks instead of sharp, well-defined peaks."
      },
      {
        "context": "The study of metamictness helps in understanding the long-term effects of radiation damage on materials.",
        "example": "Understanding metamictness is crucial for the safe disposal of nuclear waste, as it can affect the stability of waste forms."

    "geological_context": [
      {
        "context": "Metamict minerals are often found in granites and pegmatites, where radioactive elements are concentrated.",
        "example": "Allanite, zircon, and thorite are common examples of minerals that can exhibit metamictness in geological settings."
      },
      {
        "context": "The metamict state can influence the weathering and alteration of minerals in the Earth's crust.",
        "example": "Metamict minerals may be more susceptible to chemical weathering due to their disordered structure."
