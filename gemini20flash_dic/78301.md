  "definition": "The germline refers to the sequence of germ cells (sex cells, such as sperm and egg cells) that are used by sexually reproducing organisms to transmit genes from one generation to the next. Germ cells are different from somatic cells, which are the other cells in the body. Germline mutations are mutations that occur in germ cells and can be passed on to offspring, while somatic mutations occur in somatic cells and are not heritable.",
  "example": "Germline mutations can lead to inherited diseases.",
