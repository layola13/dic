  "translation": "非芳香的",
  "definition": "In organic chemistry, a nonaromatic compound is a cyclic compound that does not possess a delocalized π-electron system and, therefore, does not exhibit aromaticity. These compounds do not follow Hückel's rule, which requires a planar, cyclic, conjugated system with (4n+2) π electrons for aromaticity.",
  "example": "Cyclohexane is a nonaromatic hydrocarbon.",

    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "The properties of nonaromatic compounds differ significantly from those of aromatic compounds.",

      },
      {
        "example": "Many aliphatic compounds are nonaromatic.",

      {
        "example": "Nonaromatic compounds lack the characteristic delocalized electron cloud found in aromatic systems.",

      {
        "example": "The bond lengths in nonaromatic cyclic compounds are not uniform, unlike in benzene.",

      {
        "example": "Aromatic compounds are more stable than their nonaromatic counterparts due to resonance stabilization.",
