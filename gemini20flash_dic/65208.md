I can certainly help you with creating a JSON format detailing the word "eti," similar to the example you provided for "what." However, "eti" doesn't have a widely recognized meaning in English. To make this useful, I'll make some assumptions and provide a structure that you can then adapt with accurate information.

Here's the JSON structure. I've filled in some placeholder information, focusing on the likely use of "eti" as a prefix or a combining form in specialized contexts (like etymology or scientific fields).  Please replace the placeholder content with verified definitions, examples, and translations relevant to the actual meaning of "eti" in the context you're interested in.

```json

  "antonyms": ["result", "effect", "consequence"],
  "usage": {

      },
      {

    ],
    "linguistic_context": [

      },
      {
        "example": "The etymological root shows the original 'eti-' meaning.",
        "translation": "词源学词根显示了最初的 'eti-' 含义。"
      }
    ]
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [

        "translation": "病因发病机制"

    ],
    "idioms": [
      {
        "phrase": "etiology of disease",
        "translation": "疾病的病因"
      },
      {
        "phrase": "etiological study",
        "translation": "病因学研究"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Remember to replace the placeholder translations and definitions with the correct information relevant to how "eti" is actually used. If "eti" is specific to a particular field (like medicine, linguistics, etc.), tailor the examples and definitions to that field for accuracy.
