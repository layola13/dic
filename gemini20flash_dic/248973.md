非常抱歉，您提供的单词 "whod" 并不是一个标准的英文单词。它更像是 "who'd" 的误写，是 "who would" 或 "who had" 的缩写形式。

如果您的意思是 "who'd" (who would/who had)，您可以根据以上 "who," "would," 和 "had" 的解释，将它们组合起来理解。 例如：

*   "Who'd like to go?"  = "Who would like to go?" (谁想去？)
*   "Who'd have thought?" = "Who would have thought?" (谁会想到？)
*   "Who'd been there before?" = "Who had been there before?" (之前谁去过那里？)

希望这些信息对您有所帮助！
