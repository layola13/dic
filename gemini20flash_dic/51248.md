  "definition": "In object-oriented programming, a destructor is a special method of a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is destroyed. Its purpose is to release any resources (such as memory, file handles, or network connections) held by the object before it is deallocated.",
  "example": "The destructor is used to free dynamically allocated memory.",

    "general_context": [
      {
        "example": "When an object goes out of scope, its destructor is automatically invoked.",

        "example": "If a class allocates memory, its destructor should deallocate it.",

      {
        "example": "Java does not have destructors in the same way as C++; garbage collection handles memory management.",
