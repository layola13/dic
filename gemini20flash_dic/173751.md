  "definition": "Having some, but not all, of the properties of being normal. The term is often used in physics, especially in the context of quasi-normal modes.",
  "example": "The quasi-normal modes of a black hole describe how it returns to a stable state after being disturbed.",

  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "context": "In physics, quasi-normal modes (QNMs) are solutions of a perturbed system that decay in time, representing damped oscillations.",
        "example": "The study of quasi-normal modes is crucial in understanding the stability and dynamics of black holes and other compact objects."
      },
      {
        "context": "In mathematics, a quasi-normal distribution might refer to a distribution that approximates a normal distribution but has slight deviations.",
        "example": "The data exhibited a quasi-normal distribution, with a slight skewness towards higher values."

    "physics": [
      {
        "context": "Black Hole Physics",
        "example": "Quasi-normal modes are observed in the gravitational waves emitted by black holes when they are perturbed.",
        "explanation": "When a black hole is disturbed, it vibrates at specific frequencies known as quasi-normal modes, which can be detected as gravitational waves."

      {
        "context": "String Theory",
        "example": "In the context of string theory, quasi-normal modes can provide insights into the properties of black holes and other exotic objects.",
