  "definition": "Plural form of electrolyte. Electrolytes are substances that produce an electrically conducting solution when dissolved in a polar solvent, such as water. The dissolved electrolytes separate into cations (positively charged ions) and anions (negatively charged ions), which disperse uniformly through the solvent. This solution conducts electricity because the ions facilitate the transport of charge through the solution.",
