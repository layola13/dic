    "general_examples": [
      {
        "sentence": "The study examined the recessivenesses of several genetic mutations within the population.",
        "translation": "该研究调查了人群中几种基因突变的隐性情况。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "Understanding the recessivenesses involved is crucial for predicting the inheritance patterns of these diseases.",
        "translation": "理解所涉及的隐性对于预测这些疾病的遗传模式至关重要。"

      {
        "sentence": "The complexities of these recessivenesses often require extensive genetic testing to fully understand.",
