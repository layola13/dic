  "definition": "Ekman can refer to several things, most notably related to oceanography and psychology. It can refer to: \n\n*   Vagn Walfrid Ekman: A Swedish oceanographer.\n*   Ekman layer: A layer in the ocean or atmosphere where there is a balance between pressure gradient force, Coriolis force, and turbulent friction.\n*   Ekman transport: The net transport of water by wind-driven surface currents.\n*   Ekman spiral: A structure of currents or winds near a horizontal boundary in which the flow direction rotates as one moves away from the boundary.\n*   Paul Ekman: An American psychologist known for his work on emotions and facial expressions.",
  "example": "Ekman transport is an important factor in coastal upwelling.",
