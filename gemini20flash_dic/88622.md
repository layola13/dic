OK. I will parse the word "hlm" according to the provided JSON format. However, "hlm" is not a standard English word, so the information provided below will be limited.

```json
{
  "word": "hlm",
  "phonetics": "N/A",
  "part_of_speech": "N/A",
  "translation": "N/A",
  "definition": "This is not a standard English word.",
  "example": "N/A",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {},
  "phrases": {}
}
