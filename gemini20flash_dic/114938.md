I am sorry, but there is no commonly recognized English word spelled "managey." It is possible that it could be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a term specific to a certain context or community. Without more context, it's difficult to provide a detailed analysis in the requested JSON format.

If you meant "manage," here's the JSON formatted information for it:
