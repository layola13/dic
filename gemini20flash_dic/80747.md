I was unable to find a detailed breakdown of the word "goson" that matches the format you provided for "what." It is possible that "goson" is not a standard English word or may be a technical term with a very specific usage. Without more context, it's difficult to create a comprehensive entry.

If "goson" is a term from a specific field (like computer science, medicine, or a particular industry), providing that context might help in finding relevant information to populate the fields in your desired JSON format.

I can, however, create a template JSON structure for "goson" based on your "what" example. Keep in mind that the information within would be placeholder values or educated guesses.

```json
{
  "word": "goson",
  "phonetics": "/ˈɡoʊsɒn/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "假设的含义",
  "definition": "一个假设的例子，用于演示JSON格式。",
  "example": "This is a goson example.",
  "synonyms": ["example", "placeholder"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [
      { "question": "What is goson?", "translation": "什么是goson？" },
      { "question": "How to use goson?", "translation": "如何使用goson？" }
    ],
    "present_continuous": [
      { "question": "What are you doing with goson now?", "translation": "你现在用goson做什么？" },
      { "question": "Is she reading goson documentation?", "translation": "她在读goson文档吗？" }
    ],

      { "question": "What has he been working on with goson lately?", "translation": "他最近一直在用goson做什么？" }
    ]
  },
  "phrases": {

    "idioms": [

}
```
