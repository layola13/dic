I'll do my best to provide the JSON format information for the word "Herts". However, "Herts" is a shortened version of Hertfordshire, which is a place name. Place names typically don't have direct translations, synonyms, antonyms, or usage examples in the same way that common nouns or verbs do. Therefore, I will provide general information related to it.
