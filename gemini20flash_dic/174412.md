  "translation": "……的安静, ……的宁静 (Possessive form)",
  "definition": "This is the possessive form of the noun 'quietness'. It refers to the quality or state of being quiet or calm, attributed to a specific person, place, or thing.  Because 'quietness' already ends in 's', the possessive is usually formed by adding an apostrophe only ('quietness''). However, the form 'quietness's' is grammatically permissible, though less common and potentially stylistically awkward. It is typically used to indicate the quietness belonging to or associated with something specific.",
  "example": "The library's quietness's appeal was irresistible to students needing to focus. (Less common, 'The library's quietness' is preferred.)",

   "Stylistic_Considerations": [
     {
        "explanation": "The form 'quietness's' is generally considered less elegant and more cumbersome than 'quietness''. In most contexts, using just the apostrophe is preferred for possessive forms of nouns ending in 's', particularly when the word is a relatively common one.  The choice to use 'quietness's' sometimes comes down to personal preference or a desire to avoid ambiguity in rare cases."
