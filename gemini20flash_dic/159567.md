I'll do my best to provide a detailed breakdown of the word "polkaing" in JSON format, similar to the example you provided for "what." However, "polkaing" is not a standard English word. It seems to be a verb form derived from the noun "polka," which refers to a lively dance. Therefore, I will create an entry based on this understanding.
