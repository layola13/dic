I looked for the word "roguy" and couldn't find it in common dictionaries. It's possible that "roguy" is a misspelling, a very rare word, a newly coined term, or specific to a certain context. If it's a misspelling, the user may have intended the word "rogue." I can provide information for the word "rogue," if that is helpful.
