  "word": "amitosis",
  "phonetics": "/ˌæmiːtoʊˈsɪs/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "无丝分裂",
  "definition": "A type of cell division that does not involve the formation of chromosomes. The nucleus divides by constriction, followed by the division of the cytoplasm. It is a direct method of cell division, in contrast to mitosis and meiosis.",
  "example": "Amitosis is commonly observed in certain tissues of invertebrates and in some abnormal or diseased cells of higher organisms.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": ["mitosis", "meiosis"],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "Amitosis is a simpler and more direct form of nuclear division compared to mitosis.",
        "translation": "与有丝分裂相比，无丝分裂是一种更简单、更直接的核分裂形式。"
      },
      {
        "example": "In amitosis, the nuclear envelope does not break down, and there is no formation of a spindle apparatus.",
        "translation": "在无丝分裂中，核膜不会分解，也不会形成纺锤体装置。"
      }
    ],
    "biological_context": [
      {
        "example": "Amitosis can occur in aging cells or cells under stress.",
        "translation": "无丝分裂可能发生在衰老细胞或处于应激状态下的细胞中。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Some prokaryotic cells divide by a process similar to amitosis.",
        "translation": "一些原核细胞通过类似于无丝分裂的过程进行分裂。"
      }
    ],
    "research_context": [
      {
        "example": "Research on amitosis is limited due to its rarity and the complexity of studying it in detail.",
        "translation": "由于无丝分裂的罕见性以及对其进行详细研究的复杂性，对无丝分裂的研究受到限制。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Scientists have observed amitosis in the macronucleus of ciliates.",
        "translation": "科学家们在纤毛虫的大核中观察到了无丝分裂。"
      }
    ],
    "comparative_biology": [
      {
        "example": "Unlike mitosis, amitosis does not ensure equal distribution of genetic material to daughter cells.",
        "translation": "与有丝分裂不同，无丝分裂不能确保遗传物质平均分配到子细胞。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Amitosis differs significantly from meiosis, which is involved in sexual reproduction and genetic diversity.",
        "translation": "无丝分裂与减数分裂有显著不同，减数分裂涉及有性生殖和遗传多样性。"
