          "comment": "Important note: 'reflex's' is a relatively uncommon possessive form. It is much more typical to use 'reflex' in an attributive way (e.g., 'reflex action', 'reflex response') or to rephrase the sentence (e.g., 'the mechanism of the reflex'). Using 'reflex's' can sound awkward in many contexts."
