I was unable to find a recognized English word spelled "pactional." It is possible that it is a misspelling, a technical term specific to a niche field, a newly coined word, or simply a word that does not exist in standard English dictionaries.

I can, however, provide you with a JSON format structure based on your "what" example, but I will have to leave most of the fields blank due to the lack of information on the word "pactional."

```json
{
  "word": "pactional",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": null,
  "translation": null,
  "definition": null,
  "example": null,
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {},
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [],
    "idioms": []
  }
}
```

If you have more information about the word "pactional," such as its intended meaning or the context in which you encountered it, I might be able to provide a more complete analysis.
