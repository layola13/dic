Based on my search, "tesly" does not appear to be a standard English word. Therefore, the JSON object contains null values, empty arrays, and empty dictionaries. If "tesly" is a proper noun, jargon, or a word from another language, further context would be needed to provide a more complete definition and usage examples.
