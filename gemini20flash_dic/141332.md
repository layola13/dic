I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a detailed JSON analysis for "openness's" in the same comprehensive format as the example for "what." The word "openness's" is a possessive form of the noun "openness," which refers to the quality of being open, honest, and willing to consider new ideas or opinions. Because it is a possessive noun, it doesn't have the same kind of varied usage patterns, tenses, or idiomatic expressions that a word like "what" does.

I can provide a basic JSON structure with the information I can gather:

```json
{
  "word": "openness's",
  "part_of_speech": "noun, possessive",
  "translation": "开放性的（所有格）",
  "definition": "The possessive form of the quality of being open, honest, and willing to consider new ideas or opinions.",
  "example": "The company's success depends on openness's role in fostering innovation. / 公司的成功取决于开放性在促进创新中的作用。",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "description": "As a possessive noun, 'openness's' is used to indicate that something belongs to or is associated with the quality of openness.",
    "examples": [
      {
        "sentence": "Openness's impact on team collaboration is significant.",
        "translation": "开放性对团队协作的影响是显著的。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "The project benefited from openness's contribution to problem-solving.",
        "translation": "该项目受益于开放性对解决问题的贡献。"
      }
    ]
  },
  "phrases": {}
}
```
