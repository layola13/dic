I was unable to find a precise definition, phonetics, or standard usage examples for the word "demotist" in the way you've requested. It's possible this is a very rare word, a newly coined term, or perhaps a typo. It may also be a specialized term not found in general dictionaries.

Because of the lack of information for that term, I will provide a detailed breakdown of the word based on its components and how those might be used in English. This is speculative, but it may help you understand or use the word if it is, in fact, a valid term.
