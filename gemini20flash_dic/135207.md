  "translation": "Not by osmosis",
  "definition": "In a manner that does not involve osmosis. Osmosis is the movement of a solvent (like water) across a semipermeable membrane from an area of lower solute concentration to an area of higher solute concentration. Therefore, 'nonosmotically' refers to processes or conditions where this type of movement is not occurring or is prevented.",
  "example": "The substance was transported nonosmotically across the cell membrane.",

  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "The drug was delivered to the cell nonosmotically, ensuring a more controlled release.",
        "translation": "这种药物以非渗透的方式输送到细胞，确保了更可控的释放。"

        "example": "Water can enter the plant through nonosmotic pathways when the osmotic gradient is insufficient.",

        "example": "The transport mechanism functions nonosmotically, relying on protein channels rather than osmotic pressure.",
