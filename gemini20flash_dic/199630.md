I'll do my best to provide a detailed JSON format analysis for the word "sinningnesses", but I need to preface that this is not a standard English word. It appears to be a constructed word, likely formed by adding suffixes to the word "sinning." As such, dictionary-level information like pronunciation and standard usages will be unavailable. I will, however, break down its possible construction and meaning based on its components.
