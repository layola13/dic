  "word": "irising",
  "phonetics": "/ˈaɪrɪsɪŋ/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "虹膜现象，光圈效应",
  "definition": "Irising refers to a visual defect or effect that appears as a rainbow-like or iris-shaped pattern, typically caused by imperfections in optical surfaces, thin film interference, or other optical phenomena. It can also refer to the action of a camera or optical device adjusting its aperture, similar to the opening and closing of an eye's iris.",
  "example": "The irising effect on the lens made the image appear distorted.",
  "synonyms": ["color fringing", "diffraction", "optical aberration", "aperture adjustment", "diaphragm control"],
  "antonyms": [],
