I can certainly help you with that. However, the word you provided, "zooegraphic," appears to be a misspelling or a neologism, as it is not found in standard dictionaries. If you meant a different word, please let me know.

Assuming that "zooegraphic" is related to the combination of "zoo" (related to animals) and "geographic" (related to geography), I'll create a hypothetical JSON structure based on this interpretation. Please note that this is a speculative definition.
