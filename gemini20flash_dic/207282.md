  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "胸锁乳突肌",
  "definition": "A muscle in the neck that is responsible for flexing and rotating the head.",
  "example": "The sternomastoid muscle is located on the side of the neck, running from the sternum and clavicle to the mastoid process of the temporal bone.",

  "usage": {
    "description": [
      {
        "context": "Anatomy",
        "explanation": "The sternomastoid muscle is a paired muscle, meaning there is one on each side of the neck. It plays a key role in neck movement and head control."
      },
      {
        "context": "Function",
        "explanation": "When both sternomastoid muscles contract together, they flex the neck, bringing the chin towards the chest. When one muscle contracts, it rotates the head to the opposite side and flexes the neck laterally."

    "clinical_context": [
      {
        "condition": "Torticollis",
        "explanation": "Torticollis, also known as wry neck, can occur when the sternomastoid muscle is shortened or contracted, causing the head to tilt to one side."
      },
      {
        "condition": "Muscle Strain",
        "explanation": "The sternomastoid muscle can be strained due to sudden movements or poor posture, leading to neck pain and stiffness."
