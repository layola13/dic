I was unable to find an exact dictionary entry for the word "pumicers." It is possible that this word is a misspelling, a technical term, a very rare word, or a newly coined word. However, I can offer a breakdown of what the word *might* mean based on its possible root and structure.

It looks like it could be related to "pumice," which is a type of volcanic rock. If "pumicer" is a word, it could potentially refer to:

*   Someone who works with pumice.
*   Something that is made of pumice.
*   A tool used for working with pumice.

Based on this, here's a possible JSON format, keeping in mind that this is speculative:
