  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "同种免疫",
  "definition": "The process of developing antibodies against antigens from individuals of the same species, but with a different genetic makeup. This typically occurs when a mother is exposed to fetal red blood cells that she does not possess, leading to the production of antibodies that can attack fetal red blood cells in subsequent pregnancies.",
  "example": "Isoimmunization can occur during pregnancy when fetal red blood cells cross into the mother's circulation, particularly if the mother is Rh-negative and the fetus is Rh-positive.",
  "synonyms": [
    "alloimmunization",
    "Rhesus incompatibility (when referring specifically to Rh factor)"
  ],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general_context": [
      {
        "example": "The risk of isoimmunization can be reduced with prophylactic Rho(D) immune globulin administration to Rh-negative mothers.",
