*   **Context Dependence:** The actual meaning of "ellingeness" would heavily depend on the context in which it is used.

Because the word is so rare, the 'usage' and 'phrases' sections are based on educated guesses of how it *could* be used, rather than actual examples found in texts. I hope this comprehensive, though partly speculative, analysis is helpful!
