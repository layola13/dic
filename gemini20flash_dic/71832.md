  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "短暂性的",
  "definition": "This is actually a somewhat unusual construction.  'Fleetingness' means the quality of being fleeting, i.e., short-lived or transient. The addition of \"'s\" here indicates possession. So, 'fleetingness's' refers to something that belongs to or is associated with the quality of being fleeting or temporary. Since it is uncommon, the exact interpretation depends heavily on context. A more typical phrasing would be 'the fleetingness of...', or 'characteristic of fleetingness', etc.",
  "example": "The fleetingness's subtle charm captured the essence of the cherry blossoms' beauty. (Meaning: The subtle charm belonging to the quality of fleetingness captured... It's more natural to say: 'The subtle charm of fleetingness captured...')",

        "note": "Due to the possessive form on an abstract noun ending in -ness, this term's use is highly contextual and less common in standard English. It's generally better to rephrase using 'the fleetingness of' or similar structures.",
        "translation": "由于抽象名词以 -ness 结尾，并且使用了所有格形式，因此该术语的使用在很大程度上取决于上下文，并且在标准英语中不太常见。通常最好使用“……的短暂性”或类似的结构进行改述。"
