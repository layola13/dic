  "definition": "BrainGate is a brain-computer interface (BCI) technology developed by Cyberkinetics, Inc. designed to help individuals with paralysis or amputation regain control of their limbs and other functions. It involves implanting a sensor into the motor cortex of the brain, which then records neural signals and translates them into commands that can control external devices such as computers, robotic arms, or communication systems.",
  "example": "The BrainGate system allowed the patient to control a computer cursor using only their thoughts.",
