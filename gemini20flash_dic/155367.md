  "definition": "Pharming is a cyberattack intended to redirect a website's traffic to another, fake site. Pharming can be conducted either by changing the hosts file on a victim's computer or by exploiting a vulnerability in DNS server software. Pharming is different from phishing, which relies on tricking users into providing their credentials or personal information.",
