  "translation": "假塑性",
  "definition": "The property of certain fluids that become less viscous when subjected to shear stress. These fluids exhibit shear thinning behavior, where their viscosity decreases as the rate of shear increases.",
  "example": "Some paints and coatings exhibit pseudoplasticity, making them easier to apply in a thin, even layer.",
  "synonyms": [
    "shear-thinning",
    "non-Newtonian fluid behavior"
  ],
  "antonyms": [
    "dilatancy",
    "shear thickening"
  ],
  "usage": {
    "general_examples": [
      {
        "sentence": "Pseudoplasticity is an important property in many industrial applications, such as in the manufacturing of cosmetics and food products.",
        "translation": "假塑性在许多工业应用中都是一个重要的性质，例如化妆品和食品的生产。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "The pseudoplastic behavior of a fluid can be characterized by measuring its viscosity at different shear rates.",
        "translation": "可以通过测量流体在不同剪切速率下的粘度来表征流体的假塑性行为。"

    "technical_context": [
      {
        "sentence": "In drilling fluids, pseudoplasticity helps to suspend drill cuttings when the fluid is not flowing and allows for easier pumping when the fluid is in motion.",
        "translation": "在钻井液中，假塑性有助于在流体不流动时悬浮钻屑，并在流体运动时更容易泵送。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "Many polymer solutions exhibit pseudoplasticity due to the alignment of polymer chains under shear.",
        "translation": "由于聚合物链在剪切作用下的排列，许多聚合物溶液表现出假塑性。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "The degree of pseudoplasticity can be controlled by adjusting the concentration and type of additives in the fluid.",
        "translation": "可以通过调节流体中添加剂的浓度和类型来控制假塑性的程度。"
      }
    ],
    "comparative_examples": [
      {
        "sentence": "Unlike Newtonian fluids, which have a constant viscosity, pseudoplastic fluids exhibit a viscosity that decreases with increasing shear rate.",
        "translation": "与具有恒定粘度的牛顿流体不同，假塑性流体的粘度随着剪切速率的增加而降低。"

      {
        "term": "Thixotropy",
        "definition": "A time-dependent shear thinning property.  The viscosity decreases under constant shear stress over time, and recovers when the stress is removed."
