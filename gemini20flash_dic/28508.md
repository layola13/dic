I was unable to find an exact definition or breakdown for the word "cardecu" using online dictionaries and resources. It's possible that "cardecu" is a misspelling, a very rare word, a technical term not commonly found in general dictionaries, or even a made-up word.

I can, however, offer a general template for how you could structure a JSON response for a word definition, based on your example for the word "what." If you can provide more context about where you encountered "cardecu," I might be able to provide a more accurate analysis.

Here's the template, which you can then fill in with the appropriate information if you find it:
