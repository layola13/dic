您要求我详细解析英文单词“priser”，并按照您提供的“what”的JSON格式返回结果。但是，“priser”并不是一个标准的英文单词。它有可能是“price”的变体（比如复数形式），或者是其他语言的词汇。鉴于此，我将提供两种方案：

1.  **如果“priser”是“price”的某种形式（可能性较大）**，我将按照“price”的意思进行解析，并尝试提供相应的JSON格式数据。
2.  **如果“priser”是其他语言的词汇**，由于我无法确定具体语言和词义，我将尽力提供一些可能的信息，但JSON格式的内容可能会有所欠缺。

请您确认“priser”是否为笔误，或者提供更多关于该词的背景信息，以便我更准确地完成解析。

如果“priser”是“price”的复数形式，以下是JSON格式的解析：
