I was unable to find enough information about the word "tokitaka" to provide a comprehensive JSON format breakdown as you requested. It may be a proper noun, a technical term, or a word in a language other than English. I can, however, offer a general template in the JSON format you specified, including the fields you requested, in case you have more information to add to it.

```json
{
  "word": "tokitaka",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": null,
  "translation": null,
  "definition": null,
  "example": null,
  "synonyms": [],

If you can provide additional details about the word "tokitaka," such as its language of origin, context, or any known definitions, I may be able to refine this JSON structure further.
