I'm sorry, but I couldn't find enough information about the word "postcenal" to provide a detailed JSON format as you requested. It's possible that the word is very rare, newly coined, or perhaps a technical term not widely documented. I can offer you a general template for how such a JSON might look if you were able to fill in the details yourself:

```json
{
  "word": "postcenal",
  "phonetics": "Pronunciation if available",
  "part_of_speech": "Part of speech (e.g., adjective)",
  "translation": "Translation in Chinese",
  "definition": "Detailed definition of the word",
  "example": "Example sentence using the word",
  "synonyms": ["List of synonyms"],
  "antonyms": ["List of antonyms"],
  "usage": {
    "examples": [
      {
        "sentence": "Example sentence in English",
        "translation": "Translation of the sentence in Chinese"
      }
    ]
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [
      {
        "phrase": "Phrase using the word",
        "translation": "Translation of the phrase"
      }
    ],
    "idioms": [
      {
        "phrase": "Idiom using the word",
        "translation": "Translation of the idiom"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
