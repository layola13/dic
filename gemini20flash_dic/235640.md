I'll do my best to provide a comprehensive JSON format analysis for the word "unloathest," but I need to clarify that "unloathest" is an extremely rare and archaic word. It is the second-person singular simple present form of the verb "unloathe," which means to cease loathing or detesting. Because of its rarity, detailed usage examples and modern context are very limited.
