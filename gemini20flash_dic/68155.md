  "definition": "This word is not commonly used in standard English. It appears to be a non-standard pluralization of 'failingness,' which itself is a rarely used term. If used, it would refer to multiple instances or aspects of failure or inadequacy.",
  "example": "The report detailed the failingnesses of the project, highlighting areas where improvements were needed. (This is an example of how it *might* be used, but it's not typical.)",

      {
        "reason": "The suffix '-ness' typically transforms adjectives into nouns indicating a state or quality (e.g., 'kind' becomes 'kindness'). Applying it to 'failing' and then pluralizing it is grammatically unusual and stylistically awkward.",
        "better_alternatives": "Using 'failings' (a noun) or rephrasing the sentence to use 'failures' provides better clarity."
