  "definition": "In probability theory and statistics, covariance is a measure of the joint variability of two random variables.",
  "example": "The covariance between height and weight is positive, indicating that taller people tend to be heavier.",
  "synonyms": ["joint variability", "statistical dependence", "interdependence"],
  "antonyms": ["independence"],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "Covariance is used to understand the relationship between two variables in a dataset.",
        "translation": "协方差用于理解数据集中两个变量之间的关系。"
      },
      {
        "example": "A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to increase or decrease together.",
        "translation": "正协方差表示变量倾向于一起增加或减少。"

        "example": "A negative covariance indicates that one variable tends to increase as the other decreases.",

        "example": "Zero covariance indicates that the variables are linearly independent.",
