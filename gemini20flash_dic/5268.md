  "definition": "In linguistics, allomorphism refers to the variation of a morpheme (the smallest meaningful unit of a language) in its phonetic form without changing its meaning. These variations are called allomorphs.  The term can also be used in other fields like mineralogy to describe variations in crystal structure that don't change the fundamental composition.",
  "example": "The plural morpheme in English has allomorphisms like '-s', '-es', and irregular forms like changing 'foot' to 'feet'. These are all allomorphisms of the plural morpheme.",
