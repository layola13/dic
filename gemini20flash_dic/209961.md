  "definition": "In the context of computer graphics and 3D modeling, 'subfaces' refers to the smaller faces that make up a larger face on a 3D model. These are often created when a face is subdivided to add more detail or to allow for more complex deformation. In the context of materials science, 'subfaces' might refer to different facets or orientations present on a surface.",
  "example": "The software automatically generated subfaces to refine the mesh detail.",
