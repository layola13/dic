  "definition": "This term doesn't have a standard, widely recognized definition in English vocabulary.  Its meaning is highly context-dependent.  It *could* refer to a pattern, rhythm, structure, or a made-up word with a specific significance within a particular context.  Without more context, its meaning is purely speculative. The closest concept I can assign is referring to any structure that takes the format of a repeating of elements/events.  In general, if we assume it is referring to a design, it is likely to be used as a qualifier to denote a certain uniqueness.",
