I was unable to find a precise definition and usage examples for the word "widowly." It is possible that this word is very rare, newly coined, or perhaps a misspelling. I can, however, offer you a JSON format structure with some general information and placeholders, based on what the structure you provided for "what." Please note that the phonetic transcription, translation, definition, example sentences, synonyms, antonyms, and usage examples below are based on my best guess and may not be entirely accurate.
