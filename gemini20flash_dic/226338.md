I can help you with that! Unfortunately, "tuts" is not a standard English word. It might be slang, jargon, or a term specific to a particular field or community. Without more context, it's difficult to provide a detailed analysis in the format you requested.

To help me create the JSON object for "tuts", could you provide more information? For example:

*   Where did you encounter this word?
*   What do you think it might mean?
*   Is it related to a specific topic or industry?

Once I have a better understanding of the word, I can create a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
