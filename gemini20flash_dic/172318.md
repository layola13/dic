I was unable to find a common English word spelled "puteal." It is possible that the word is highly specialized, technical, archaic, or simply a misspelling. I can, however, provide you with a JSON structure based on your "what" example, but the fields will be largely empty.

```json
{
  "word": "puteal",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": null,
  "translation": null,
  "definition": null,
  "example": null,
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {},
  "phrases": {

    "idioms": []
  }
}
