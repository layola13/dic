  "usage": {
    "description": "The sternothyroid muscle is primarily involved in controlling the position of the larynx and hyoid bone. It works in conjunction with other infrahyoid muscles.",
    "functions": [
      {
        "function": "Depression of Larynx",
        "explanation": "The sternothyroid muscle helps to lower the larynx, which is important for vocalization and swallowing."
      },
      {
        "function": "Depression of Hyoid Bone",
        "explanation": "By pulling the hyoid bone downwards, it aids in the movement of the tongue and supports swallowing."
