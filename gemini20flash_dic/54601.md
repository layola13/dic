I couldn’t find an exact match for the word "dismask." It is possible that there may be a typo in the word, or it could be a very recent or specialized term not yet widely documented. If you could clarify the word or provide more context, I may be able to provide a more accurate and detailed analysis.

However, based on what you're asking, I can provide you with a JSON format similar to the example you gave for "what", but with placeholder information and some educated guesses based on potential interpretations of "dismask":
