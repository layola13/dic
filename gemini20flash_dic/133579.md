  "definition": "This is not a standard English word. It's a constructed word based on the following morphemes:\n\n*   **non-**: prefix meaning 'not'\n*   **flaky**: adjective meaning 'forming flakes or scales; unreliable'\n*   **-ly**: suffix that turns an adjective into an adverb (here, 'flakily')\n*   **-ness**: suffix that turns an adverb into a noun (here, 'flakilyness', which would mean 'the state of being flakily')\n*   **-es**: plural suffix. Therefore, 'nonflakilynesses' would be the plural of 'nonflakilyness'.",
  "example": "Since 'nonflakilynesses' is not a real word, it would not appear in common usage. If one were to use it, it might be in a highly theoretical or humorous context.",
