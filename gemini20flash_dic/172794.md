  "word": "quadrilateralnesses",
  "phonetics": "N/A (highly unusual word, no standard phonetic transcription available)",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "四边形性质 (an extremely rare and arguably incorrect pluralization/abstraction of the properties of quadrilaterals)",
  "definition": "This word is a highly unusual and complex formation. It attempts to represent the concept of multiple qualities or states associated with being a quadrilateral. It's formed by taking 'quadrilateral,' adding '-ness' to abstract it into a quality, and then pluralizing it with '-es' as if referring to multiple instances of that quality. It's not a standard English word and would likely be confusing to most speakers.",
  "example": "The discussion revolved around the various quadrilateralnesses exhibited by different types of four-sided shapes, such as the equality of sides in a square or the parallel nature of sides in a parallelogram. (This is a contrived example to illustrate potential usage, but the word remains highly unconventional)",
  "synonyms": ["properties of quadrilaterals", "characteristics of quadrilaterals", "attributes of quadrilaterals"],

    "theoretical_contexts": [
      {
        "example": "In abstract geometry, one might ponder the different quadrilateralnesses and their implications for spatial relationships.",

      {
        "example": "The philosopher questioned whether quadrilateralnesses exist independently of our perception of quadrilaterals.",

        "example": "In a discussion on geometric abstraction, the concept of quadrilateralnesses was used to illustrate the process of generalizing specific properties.",

  "notes": "This word is highly unusual and not recommended for general use. It is an attempt to create an abstract noun from 'quadrilateral' and then pluralize it, which is grammatically possible but semantically strained. Use more common phrases like 'properties of quadrilaterals' instead."
