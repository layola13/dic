  "notes": "It is important to note that 'overbearingness' is already a noun, and adding 's' makes it possessive.  Therefore, it's used when referring to something belonging to or caused by the overbearingness itself. The use case is somewhat rare, as it often sounds awkward and can be rephrased more naturally.  It's included here for completeness in understanding the possibilities of English grammar."
