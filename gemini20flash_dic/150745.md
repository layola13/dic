  "translation": "准整合",
  "definition": "A type of unconformity (a break in a sedimentary sequence) where the beds above and below the unconformity are parallel, and there is no apparent erosion at the surface of the unconformity. Paraconformities can be very difficult to detect.",
  "example": "The geologist struggled to identify the paraconformity in the rock layers due to the lack of visible erosion.",

      {
        "sentence": "Unlike other types of unconformities, paraconformities lack a clear erosional surface, making them challenging to detect.",
