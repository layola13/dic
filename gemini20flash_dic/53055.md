  "definition": "A unit of measurement of the optical power of a lens or curved mirror, which is equal to the reciprocal of the focal length measured in metres (i.e. 1/metres). It is thus a unit of reciprocal length.",
  "example": "A lens with a power of +2 dioptres is a converging lens with a focal length of 0.5 metres.",
