I'll do my best to provide a detailed JSON format analysis for the word "bassness's". However, it's worth noting that "bassness's" is not a standard English word. It seems to be a possessive form of a non-standard word derived from "bass," which has multiple meanings. I will create the JSON structure based on the assumption that "bassness" is intended to be a noun related to the quality or state of being "bass-like," and "bassness's" is its possessive form.
