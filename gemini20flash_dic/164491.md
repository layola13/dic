  "definition": "In mathematics, particularly in homological algebra, 'preenveloping' describes a property of modules or objects in an abelian category. A module M is preenveloping if there exists a homomorphism M → F, where F is in a certain class of modules (e.g., flat modules), such that any homomorphism from M to another module in that class factors through F.",
  "example": "The concept of preenveloping modules is crucial in the study of homological dimensions and resolutions in module theory.",

        "sentence": "In the context of module theory, a preenveloping module possesses a specific type of morphism into a module within a designated class.",
