**Important Considerations:**

*   **Phonetics:** I couldn't find a reliable phonetic transcription for "injoint."
*   **Usage:** The word is not commonly used in modern English, so the usage examples are somewhat constructed to illustrate potential contexts.
*   **Phrases/Idioms:** Due to its rarity, "injoint" is not typically found in common phrases or idioms.

If you have more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to refine the information further!
