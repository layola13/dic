I can help with that! Please note that the word you provided, "diureticalnesses," is not a standard English word. It's a constructed word formed by adding the pluralizing suffix "-es" to "diureticalness," which itself is formed by adding the suffix "-ness" to "diuretical." "Diuretical" is a valid word, and I can provide a breakdown based on that, along with the suffixes. Here is the JSON formatted response:
