  "definition": "Sepiostare is a fossil internal shell of a cuttlefish ancestor. The sepiostare is a predecessor to the cuttlebone of modern cuttlefish, and is made of aragonite instead of the aragonite and conchiolin composition of the modern cuttlebone. Fossils are often found in Eocene-aged marine strata.",
  "example": "The sepiostare found in the Eocene strata provides valuable insights into the evolution of cuttlefish.",
