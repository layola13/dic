  "definition": "The principle of noncontradiction, also known as the law of noncontradiction (LNC), is a fundamental principle of logic. It states that contradictory statements cannot both be true in the same sense at the same time, e.g., the two propositions 'A is B' and 'A is not B' are mutually exclusive.",

        "example": "In philosophy, the principle of noncontradiction is often discussed in the context of metaphysics and epistemology.",

      {
        "example": "Formal logic uses symbols to represent statements, and the law of noncontradiction can be expressed as ¬(P ∧ ¬P), meaning 'it is not the case that P and not P'.",
        "translation": "形式逻辑使用符号来表示陈述，不矛盾律可以表示为¬(P ∧ ¬P)，意思是“P 和非 P 不是这种情况”。"

      {
        "example": "In logical arguments, any contradiction invalidates the entire argument because it violates the law of noncontradictories.",
        "translation": "在逻辑论证中，任何矛盾都会使整个论证无效，因为它违反了不矛盾律。"

      {
        "example": "If someone says, 'I am here, but I am not here,' we would immediately recognize that something is wrong because it violates the law of noncontradictories.",
