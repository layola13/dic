  "word": "nonextensive",
  "phonetics": "/ˌnɒnɪkˈstensɪv/",
  "part_of_speech": "adj.",
  "translation": "非广延性的",
  "definition": "Describing systems or properties that do not scale linearly with the system size or mass. In physics, especially thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, a nonextensive system is one where the total energy or other extensive properties are not simply the sum of the energies or properties of its constituent parts. This typically occurs in systems with long-range interactions, long-term memory, or fractal structures.",
  "example": "Nonextensive statistical mechanics is used to describe systems with long-range interactions and correlations.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": ["extensive"],
  "usage": {
    "general_context": [
      { "sentence": "The nonextensive nature of the system requires a different statistical approach.", "translation": "这个系统的非广延性需要一种不同的统计方法。" },
      { "sentence": "Nonextensive thermodynamics has been applied to various complex systems.", "translation": "非广延热力学已经被应用于各种复杂的系统。" }

    "scientific_context": [
      { "sentence": "In plasma physics, nonextensive distributions are often observed.", "translation": "在等离子体物理学中，经常观察到非广延分布。" },
      { "sentence": "The nonextensive behavior is attributed to the long-range correlations within the material.", "translation": "这种非广延行为归因于材料内部的长程关联。" }
