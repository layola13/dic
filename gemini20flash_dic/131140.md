  "word": "nonblocking",
  "phonetics": "/ˌnɒn.ˈblɒk.ɪŋ/",
  "part_of_speech": "adj.",
  "translation": "非阻塞的",
  "definition": "In computer science, a non-blocking operation allows a program to continue execution without waiting for the operation to complete. If the operation cannot be completed immediately, it returns an error or indicates that it is still in progress, allowing the program to perform other tasks.",
  "example": "The server uses nonblocking sockets to handle multiple client connections concurrently.",
  "synonyms": [
    "asynchronous",
    "non-sequential",
    "concurrent"
  ],

    "blocking",
    "synchronous",

  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "sentence": "Nonblocking I/O allows a thread to continue working while waiting for data from a network or disk.",
        "translation": "非阻塞 I/O 允许线程在等待来自网络或磁盘的数据时继续工作。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "Using nonblocking calls can improve the responsiveness of an application.",

      {
        "context": "In network programming, nonblocking sockets are often used to handle multiple client connections efficiently.",
        "example": "A nonblocking socket will return immediately even if there's no data to read.",
        "translation": "在网络编程中，非阻塞套接字通常用于有效地处理多个客户端连接。一个非阻塞套接字即使没有数据可读也会立即返回。"
      },
      {
        "context": "When dealing with threads or processes, nonblocking synchronization primitives can be used.",
        "example": "A nonblocking mutex attempt returns immediately, indicating whether the lock was acquired.",
        "translation": "在处理线程或进程时，可以使用非阻塞同步原语。非阻塞互斥锁尝试会立即返回，指示是否获取了锁。"
      },
      {
        "context": "In user interface programming, nonblocking operations can prevent the UI from freezing.",
        "example": "Performing long-running tasks in a nonblocking manner ensures the UI remains responsive.",
        "translation": "在用户界面编程中，非阻塞操作可以防止 UI 冻结。 以非阻塞方式执行长时间运行的任务可确保 UI 保持响应。"

      {
        "comparison": "Blocking operations wait until the task is complete, while nonblocking operations return immediately.",

        "comparison": "Synchronous programming relies on blocking operations; asynchronous programming uses nonblocking operations.",
