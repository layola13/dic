  "definition": "The rational expectations horizon is the period in the future over which economic agents' expectations are rational. That is, agents do not make systematic errors in forecasting economic variables within the rational expectations horizon. Beyond the rational expectations horizon, agents may make systematic errors. However, these errors are not predictable or exploitable, as agents will have already used all available information in forming their expectations.",
  "example": "In dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) models, the rational-horizon approach can solve the issue of the curse of dimensionality. It allows for the use of higher-order approximation methods, which can more accurately capture the dynamics of the economy.",

        "example": "The concept of rational-horizon is important in macroeconomic modeling because it allows economists to make predictions about the future behavior of the economy based on the assumption that economic agents are rational.",
