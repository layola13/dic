  "translation": "复理石",
  "definition": "A series of sedimentary rocks that are deposited in a deep marine environment in front of rising mountain ranges. They are characterized by repeated sequences of sandstone, shale, and conglomerate, often contorted by later tectonic activity.",
  "example": "The Alps contain extensive flysch deposits, providing evidence of the mountain range's formation through tectonic uplift and erosion.",

    "general_geological_context": [
      {
        "example": "Flysch is commonly associated with the development of orogenic belts, such as the Alps and the Himalayas.",

      },
      {
        "example": "The shale layers within flysch often contain microfossils, which can be used to determine the age and depositional environment of the rocks.",

      },
      {
        "example": "Flysch can be used to reconstruct the history of mountain building and the evolution of sedimentary basins.",
