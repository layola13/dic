  "definition": "Self-variance refers to the variance of a variable with itself. In a statistical context, it's essentially the same as the variance of that variable. It quantifies the spread or dispersion of a set of data points around their mean.",
  "example": "In signal processing, understanding the self-variance of a noise signal is crucial for filtering and noise reduction techniques.",
