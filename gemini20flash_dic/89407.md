  "part_of_speech": "adj.",
  "translation": "同序的",
  "definition": "Refers to strata or rock units that are similar in age or formed during the same time period, but not necessarily correlated in terms of specific time equivalence or synchronous deposition. It indicates a similarity in the order or sequence of rock layers without implying that the layers are exactly the same age across different locations.",
  "example": "The homotaxic layers in different regions show a similar sequence of fossil assemblages, indicating a comparable stage of geological development, although they may not be perfectly synchronous.",
  "synonyms": ["sequential", "ordered", "similar in sequence"],
  "antonyms": ["heterotaxic", "asynchronous"],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "In stratigraphy, homotaxic relationships help to establish the relative ages of rock formations across different geographical areas.",

      {
        "example": "The concept of homotaxis is useful when correlating rock layers based on the order of fossil appearances, even if the exact timing of those appearances varies.",
        "translation": "当根据化石出现的顺序来关联岩层时，同序的概念非常有用，即使这些出现的确切时间有所不同。"
