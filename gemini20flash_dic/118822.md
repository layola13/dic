  "word": "metanephridium",
  "phonetics": "/ˌmɛtəˈnɛfrɪdiəm/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "后肾",
  "definition": "A type of excretory gland found in many types of invertebrates, such as annelids, molluscs and arthropods. It consists of a ciliated funnel opening into the body cavity or coelom connected to a duct which may be variously glandularized, folded or expanded and which typically opens to the organism's exterior.",
  "example": "The metanephridium is an evolutionary advancement over the protonephridium because it filters fluid from the coelom, rather than from the body tissues.",

      },
      {
        "sentence": "The efficiency of the metanephridium in waste removal contributes to the overall health and survival of the invertebrate.",

    "evolutionary_biology": [
      {
        "sentence": "The evolution of the metanephridium represents a significant step in the development of more complex excretory systems in animals.",
