I can certainly help you with that! However, the name "Donald" does not lend itself well to the same structure as the word "what." "What" is a common English word with various grammatical functions, a definition, usage examples, and idiomatic phrases, while "Donald" is typically used as a proper noun (a name).

I can, however, provide a JSON-formatted breakdown of the name "Donald," focusing on its etymology, usage as a name, possible variations, and cultural significance, where applicable.
