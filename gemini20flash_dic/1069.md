**Important Notes:**

* **"accept of" is archaic/formal:**  The key takeaway is that `"accept of"` is generally considered archaic or very formal in modern English.  The much more common and natural way to express the same idea is simply to use `"accept"` followed directly by the object (e.g., "accept the offer," "accept the apology").
* **Rare Usage:** This response reflects the fact that "accept of" is infrequent in modern usage. Most examples demonstrate the grammatical structures while acknowledging that they aren't the preferred phrasing.
* **Passive Voice:**  The passive voice examples are *extremely* rare with "accept of."  It would be far more common to say "The gift was accepted *by* the king" using simply "accept."
* **Idioms**: Because "accept of" is not commonly used, there are no standard idioms using "accept of."  The provided JSON indicates this.
* **Translation Accuracy**: Ensure that your translators understand that while grammatically "accept of" is the same as "accept,"  it implies a formality and possible old-fashionedness that may or may not be appropriate for the context.  In many cases, simply translating "accept" will be the best choice.
* **JSON Structure**:The response is valid JSON format.
