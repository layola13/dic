  "etymology": {
    "origin": "From the Greek 'dia' (through) + 'kaiein' (to burn)",
    "explanation": "The term literally means 'burning through', referring to the way light is concentrated by reflection or refraction to form a bright, focused pattern."

    "caustic",
    "catacaustic",
    "envelope (of curves)"
  ],
  "notes": "Diacaustics are often visible as bright patterns of light, especially in environments where light is refracted or reflected through curved surfaces, such as through glass or off water.  They are related to but distinct from catacaustics, which are formed by reflection only."
