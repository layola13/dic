I'll do my best to create a JSON format breakdown for the word "tomal" based on the structure you provided for "what." However, since "tomal" doesn't seem to be a standard English word, I'll have to rely on broader linguistic principles and potential interpretations.

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Phonetics:** I've provided a plausible phonetic transcription.
*   **Part of Speech:**  Since "tomal" is unknown, I've suggested "noun (hypothetical)" as a starting point.  It *could* potentially be another part of speech depending on usage.
*   **Translation & Definition:** These sections emphasize the lack of a standard meaning and the need for context.
*   **Examples:** The examples try to use "tomal" in a grammatical way, acknowledging its unknown meaning.

Remember that this is a highly speculative analysis due to the absence of "tomal" in standard dictionaries. If you have a specific context or origin for this word, that would allow for a much more accurate and useful analysis.
