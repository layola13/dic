  "definition": "Paleosaurus is a dubious genus of basal sauropodomorph dinosaur. It lived during the Late Triassic period (Norian stage, around 227 to 208.5 million years ago), and was named by Richard Owen in 1842. It was based on some teeth discovered in what is now England. Currently, it is considered a nomen dubium because the type species, Paleosaurus cylindrodon, is based only on teeth and is therefore not diagnostic.",
  "example": "The classification of Paleosaurus has been problematic due to the limited fossil evidence.",
