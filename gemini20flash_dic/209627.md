I am sorry, but I could not find enough information online about the word "subconcealed" to fulfill your request. It may be a very rare or newly coined word. I don't have enough information to provide a detailed JSON format analysis including phonetics, part of speech, translation, definition, examples, synonyms, antonyms, usage in different tenses, and common phrases.

I can only provide a basic structure with limited information:

```json
{
  "word": "subconcealed",
  "phonetics": "Unknown",
  "part_of_speech": "Adjective (likely)",
  "translation": "难以察觉地隐藏的，隐藏在...之下的",
  "definition": "Hidden or concealed in a subtle or underlying way; not easily noticeable.",
  "example": "The subconcealed meaning of the poem was only understood after careful analysis.",
  "synonyms": ["hidden", "underlying", "covert", "subtle"],
  "antonyms": ["obvious", "overt", "apparent", "visible"],
  "usage": {
    "note": "Due to the word's rarity, comprehensive usage examples are unavailable. It would likely follow standard adjectival usage in various tenses and sentence structures.",
    "examples": [
      {
        "sentence": "The artist used subconcealed brushstrokes to create depth.",
        "translation": "艺术家使用难以察觉的笔触来创造深度。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "There was a subconcealed layer of resentment in her voice.",
        "translation": "她的声音中隐藏着一层不易察觉的怨恨。"
      }
    ]
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [],
    "idioms": []
  }
}
```

This JSON provides a basic structure with the limited information I could gather. If you have more context about the word "subconcealed," it might help in providing a more accurate and detailed analysis.
