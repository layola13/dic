**How to Use this Template:**

1.  **Replace "{entered}"** with the actual English word you want to analyze.
2.  **Fill in the `phonetics` field** with the phonetic transcription of the word.  You can find this on websites like Merriam-Webster or Wiktionary.
3.  **Fill in the `part_of_speech` field** with all the parts of speech the word can be.
4.  **Provide a basic Chinese `translation`** of the word.
5.  **Write a concise `definition`** of the word.
6.  **Add an `example` sentence** showing how the word is used.
7.  **List any `synonyms` and `antonyms`** you can find.
8.  **Populate the `usage` section** with example sentences for different tenses and grammatical structures.  Provide a Chinese translation for each sentence.
9.  **Add common `phrases` and `idioms`** that use the word, along with their Chinese translations.

**Example with "hello":**

Here's how it would look with a real word:

```json
{
  "word": "hello",
  "phonetics": "/həˈloʊ/",
  "part_of_speech": "interjection, noun, verb",
  "translation": "你好",
  "definition": "An expression of greeting.",
  "example": "Say hello to your mother for me.",
  "synonyms": ["hi", "greetings"],
  "antonyms": ["goodbye", "farewell"],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [
      { "question": "How do you say hello in Chinese?", "translation": "中文的“你好”怎么说？" }
    ],
    "simple_past": [
      { "question": "I said hello, but she didn't hear me.", "translation": "我打了招呼，但她没听到。" }
    ]
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [
      { "phrase": "Say hello to...", "translation": "向...问好" }
    ],
    "idioms": []
  }
}
```

Remember to fill in as many fields as possible to provide a comprehensive analysis of the word.  I've given you a good starting structure; you just need to populate it with the specific details for the word you're interested in.
