  "phonetics": "No standard phonetic transcription available.",
  "part_of_speech": "Noun (Plural: Retinophorans)",
  "translation": "视网膜像, 视网膜投影",
  "definition": "A retinophora (or retinotopic map) refers to the mapping of visual input from the retina to neurons, particularly in the visual cortex. It maintains the spatial relationships of the retinal image, meaning that adjacent points on the retina are generally represented by adjacent neurons in the cortex.",
  "example": "The retinophora in the visual cortex allows us to perceive spatial relationships in our visual field.",

  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "context": "In neuroscience, retinophora is used to describe the organized mapping of the visual field onto the brain.",
        "example": "Studies of retinophora help us understand how the brain processes visual information."

      {
        "context": "Retinotopic maps are found in various visual areas of the brain, including the primary visual cortex (V1).",
        "example": "Damage to the retinophora in V1 can result in specific visual field deficits."

      {
        "context": "Researchers use techniques like fMRI to study retinotopic mapping in the human brain.",

      {
        "context": "The concept of retinophora is essential for understanding visual perception and spatial representation.",

    "clinical_context": [
      {
        "context": "Clinical assessments of visual field deficits often rely on understanding the retinotopic organization of the visual pathway.",
        "example": "Perimetry tests can identify damage to specific regions of the retinophora, helping to diagnose visual disorders."
      },
      {
        "context": "Retinophora is relevant in understanding the effects of lesions or other brain damage on visual perception.",
        "example": "Stroke or trauma affecting the visual cortex can disrupt the retinophora, leading to visual impairments."
