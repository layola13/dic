非常抱歉，您提供的单词 "peoplers" 并非一个标准的英文单词。我推测您可能是想查询 "people"，或者 "peopler"，但这两个词的含义和用法都有所不同。

1.  **people** (名词): 指的是“人”或者“人们”，是 person 的复数形式。它是一个常见的词汇，用于表示群体或者泛指人类。
2.  **peopler** (非标准词汇): 这个词并不是一个标准的英语单词。如果您想表达“使…居住”或者“使… populate”的意思，应该使用动词 "populate" 或者 "people" (作为动词)。

鉴于 "peoplers" 并非标准词汇，我将分别提供 "people" 作为名词和 "people" 作为动词的详细 JSON 格式解析，以便您参考。
