  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": "adj.",
  "translation": "Possibly: Related to antiseptics or having antiseptic properties; possibly: A fictional or specialized medical term.",
  "definition": "Based on available information, 'aliseptal' is not a commonly recognized English word.  It is possible that it is a specialized medical term, a brand name, or a constructed word.  Assuming 'ali-' relates to otherness or a derivative and '-septal' relates to antiseptic qualities, one *could* infer it means having antiseptic-like properties, or relating to antiseptics in some way. Without further context or authoritative sources, the exact meaning remains speculative. It could also refer to something related to a septum (like a nasal septum) and having antiseptic properties, but this is less likely without context. A thorough search of medical dictionaries and scientific literature is recommended for definitive clarification.",
