  "translation": "后缩减 (phonetics)",
  "definition": "In phonetics, postreduction refers to the reduction or simplification of a sound (typically a vowel) that occurs *after* the stressed syllable in a word. It often involves vowels becoming shorter, more centralized (moving towards schwa /ə/), or even being elided (completely omitted). This phenomenon is common in many languages, including English.",
  "example": "The vowel in the second syllable of 'photograph' often undergoes postreduction.",
  "synonyms": ["vowel reduction", "weakening", "centralization"],
  "antonyms": ["vowel lengthening", "strengthening", "emphasis"],
  "usage": {
    "general_examples": [
      {
        "example": "In the word 'support', the 'o' in the first syllable is often reduced due to it being in an unstressed position following the stressed syllable.",
        "translation": "在单词 'support' 中，由于 'o' 位于重读音节后的非重读位置，因此通常会被缩减。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Postreduction can make it difficult for language learners to distinguish between different vowels in unstressed syllables.",
        "translation": "后缩减会使语言学习者难以区分非重读音节中的不同元音。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Phonetic transcriptions often indicate postreduction by using the schwa symbol /ə/.",
        "translation": "语音转录通常通过使用中央元音符号 /ə/ 来指示后缩减。"

      {
        "example": "Studies in acoustic phonetics have examined the degree to which vowels undergo postreduction in different dialects of English.",
