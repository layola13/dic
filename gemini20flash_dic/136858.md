  "definition": "In genetics, nonsisters refers to the chromatids of homologous chromosomes that are not sisters. Sister chromatids are the two identical copies of a single replicated chromosome that are connected by a centromere. Nonsister chromatids, on the other hand, refer to one chromatid of one chromosome of a homologous pair and either chromatid of the other chromosome of that pair.",
