I am sorry, but I could not find a standard English word "mouseship." It is possible that this is a neologism, a compound word, or a term specific to a particular context.

If "mouseship" is a compound word, it would likely combine the meanings of "mouse" and "ship." Here's a possible interpretation in JSON format based on that:
