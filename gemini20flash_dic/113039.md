Based on my search, "luming" does not appear to be a standard English word. Therefore, I have returned a JSON format with null values for most fields, as I am unable to provide a definition, translation, or examples of its use. If "luming" is a proper noun, a term from a specialized field, or a word from another language, further context would be needed to provide a more complete response.
