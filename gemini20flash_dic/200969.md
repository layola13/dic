  "definition": "Depending on the context, SLM can refer to different things. Without further context, it's difficult to determine the exact meaning. Here are a few possibilities:\n\n1.  **Spatial Light Modulator (SLM):** A device used to control the amplitude, phase, or polarization of a light beam in space and time. It's used in holography, optical computing, and other applications.\n\n2.  **Service Level Management (SLM):** A process in IT service management focused on defining, agreeing upon, and managing service levels to ensure that IT services meet the needs of the business. It involves setting targets for service performance, monitoring service delivery, and reporting on service achievements.\n\n3.  **Sustainable Land Management (SLM):** Refers to practices and technologies that aim to protect and manage land resources in a sustainable way. This approach balances the needs of agriculture, forestry, and other land uses with the need to conserve biodiversity, water resources, and soil health.\n\n4.  **Selective Laser Melting (SLM):** An additive manufacturing (3D printing) technique that uses a laser to melt and fuse powdered material together layer by layer to create a solid object.\n\n5.  **Single Layer Metallization (SLM):** In semiconductor manufacturing, refers to a type of integrated circuit (IC) fabrication process that uses a single layer of metal for interconnects.\n\n6.  **Slam (Korean slang):** A Korean slang term that is a Konglish (Korean + English) word usually referring to the action of powerfully hitting or throwing something.",
  "example": "The scientist used an SLM to create a hologram. (Spatial Light Modulator)\nThe IT team implemented SLM to improve service delivery. (Service Level Management)\nSustainable Land Management practices can prevent soil erosion. (Sustainable Land Management)\nSLM is used to produce complex metal parts. (Selective Laser Melting)",
