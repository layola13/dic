    "clinical_context": {

    },

    "Sociopathy is not always associated with violence: While some sociopaths exhibit violent behavior, many do not.  The lack of empathy and remorse are key features, not necessarily aggression.",
    "Sociopathy is not simply 'bad behavior':  It is a complex personality disorder with deeply rooted neurological and psychological components.  It is not simply a matter of choosing to be immoral."
  ],
  "note": "The term 'sociopathy' lacks a universally agreed-upon definition, leading to inconsistencies in its use.  Consulting with a mental health professional for accurate diagnosis and information is vital."
