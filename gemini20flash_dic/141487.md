  "translation": "鸦片类药物",
  "definition": "A class of drugs that include the illegal drug heroin, as well as prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, codeine, morphine, fentanyl and others. Opioids are chemically related and interact with opioid receptors on nerve cells in the body and brain. Opioid pain relievers are generally safe when taken for a short time and as prescribed by a doctor, but because they produce euphoria in addition to pain relief, they can be misused. Regular use — even as prescribed by a doctor — can lead to dependence and, when misuse occurs, opioid pain relievers can lead to addiction, overdose incidents and deaths.",
  "example": "The doctor prescribed opioids to help manage the patient's severe pain.",
