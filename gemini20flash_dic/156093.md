  "word": "photorespiration",
  "phonetics": "/ˌfoʊtoʊrɛspəˈreɪʃən/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "光呼吸",
  "definition": "A metabolic pathway in plants that occurs when the enzyme RuBisCO oxygenates RuBP, leading to a decrease in photosynthetic efficiency. It involves the uptake of oxygen and the release of carbon dioxide, using light energy but without producing ATP or NADPH.",
  "example": "Photorespiration is more likely to occur when plants are under heat or drought stress.",
  "synonyms": ["C2 photosynthesis", "oxidative photosynthetic carbon cycle"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general_context": [
      {
        "sentence": "Photorespiration reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis, especially in C3 plants.",
        "translation": "光呼吸降低了光合作用的效率，尤其是在C3植物中。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "The rate of photorespiration increases with temperature.",

    "comparative_context": [
      {
        "sentence": "Unlike photosynthesis, photorespiration does not produce energy.",
        "translation": "与光合作用不同，光呼吸不产生能量。"
      },
