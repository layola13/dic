  "definition": "Preattachment refers to the initial phase of attachment development in infants, typically occurring from birth to around 6 weeks of age. During this phase, infants display indiscriminate sociability, meaning they respond positively to any caregiver and do not yet show a preference for specific individuals. This stage is characterized by behaviors such as crying, cooing, smiling, and grasping, which are aimed at attracting and maintaining contact with caregivers.",
  "example": "During the preattachment phase, the infant is comforted by any caregiver who provides attention and care.",
