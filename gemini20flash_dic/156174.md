  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "隔膜管",
  "definition": "A tubular structure formed within a plant cell during cytokinesis (cell division), specifically in cells that undergo cell plate formation. It is composed of microtubules, actin filaments, and vesicles, and it guides the delivery of cell wall materials to the division plane, eventually forming the new cell wall that separates the two daughter cells.",
  "example": "The phragmosiphon is essential for proper cell division in plants, ensuring the accurate segregation of genetic material and the formation of functional daughter cells.",
