I'll do my best to provide a detailed JSON format analysis for the word "brennage," similar to the example you gave for "what." However, I must inform you that "brennage" is not a commonly found English word. It might be a proper noun, a technical term, a misspelling, or a word from a less common dialect or language. I will proceed with the understanding that I might need to make some educated guesses to fill in the information.

**Explanation of my approach:**

1.  **Word and Phonetics:** I kept the word as "brennage." I've made a guess at the phonetics based on similar-sounding words.
2.  **Part of Speech:** I've assumed it's a noun, as it seems most likely to be a thing or process if it exists.
3.  **Translation and Definition:** Since there's no direct translation, I've speculated on possible meanings based on potential roots ("bren" might be related to "burn" or "bran"). The translation reflects this speculation.
4.  **Example:** I've created a speculative example sentence, but it's highly dependent on the actual meaning of the word.
5.  **Synonyms and Antonyms:**  I've noted that synonyms are not readily available and would depend on the actual meaning.
6.  **Usage:** I've provided a few example sentences in different tenses, but these are based on my speculative definition. I've also added a note about the difficulty of providing accurate usage examples without knowing the true meaning.
7.  **Phrases and Idioms:** I've indicated that no common phrases or idioms were found.
8.  **Notes:** I've added a disclaimer emphasizing that the information is speculative and that further context is needed.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Context is Key:** If you have any context for the word "brennage" (where you encountered it, the subject matter it relates to), please provide it. This would allow me to refine the analysis.
*   **Misspelling:** Double-check the spelling. It's possible this is a misspelling of a more common word.
*   **Specialized Terminology:** It could be a term from a specific field (e.g., engineering, medicine, a specific industry). If you know the field, that would help.
*   **Language/Dialect:** It might be a word from a different language or a regional dialect of English.

I hope this is helpful, despite the uncertainty around the word "brennage." If you can provide more information, I can give you a more accurate analysis.
