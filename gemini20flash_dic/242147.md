  "definition": "Uranium is a chemical element with the symbol U and atomic number 92. It is a silvery-grey metal in the actinide series of the periodic table. A uranium atom has 92 protons and 92 electrons, of which 6 are valence electrons. Uranium is weakly radioactive because all its isotopes are unstable, eventually decaying into other elements.",
  "example": "Uranium is used as fuel in nuclear power plants.",
