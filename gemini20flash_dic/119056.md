I couldn’t find the word "metive" in any dictionaries or standard language resources. It is possible that this is a misspelling, a very rare word, a technical term, or a word in a language other than English.

If "metive" is a misspelling, could you clarify the correct spelling, so I can generate the JSON format?

If the word is "motive", here is the JSON format:
