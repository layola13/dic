    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "Bipennate muscles have fibers that are arranged obliquely to the tendon, allowing for a large number of fibers to be packed into a smaller area.",

      {
        "example": "Compared to fusiform muscles, bipennate muscles generally produce more force but have a shorter range of motion.",
