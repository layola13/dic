I was unable to find an exact dictionary entry for the word "photonephograph." It is possible that this is a highly specialized or newly coined term. Based on its structure, we can attempt to break it down and infer its possible meaning:

*   **photo-**: Pertaining to light.
*   **nepho-**: Pertaining to clouds.
*   **-graph**: Something written or drawn; an instrument for writing or drawing.

Based on this breakdown, "photonephograph" could potentially refer to an instrument that records light in clouds.

Given that there's no standard definition available, I will create a hypothetical JSON structure based on my inference.
