    "origin": {
        "explanation": "The idiom 'a dime a dozen' originated from the historical price of commodities. A 'dime' is a ten-cent coin, and 'a dozen' refers to twelve. Originally, it meant that something was so abundant that it could be bought cheaply, twelve for only ten cents. This implied that the item was of little worth or easily replaceable.",
        "example": "Historically, some produce might have literally been sold for a dime a dozen, leading to the expression."
