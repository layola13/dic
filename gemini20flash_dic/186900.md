  "definition": "This word appears to be a neologism, likely a portmanteau of 'riot' and 'tour'.  It probably refers to a (potentially fictional or speculative) type of tourism where the central focus involves witnessing, participating in (hypothetically), or learning about riots or similar civil unrest events. It's important to note that the term is highly speculative and could also refer to tour in the context of VR or AR experiences that simulate riots.",
