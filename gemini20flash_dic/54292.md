  "phonetics": "Unfortunately, there is no standard phonetic transcription for this word, as it's highly unusual and not commonly used. A possible attempt based on its morphology would be /dɪsˈɡʌstɪdnəsɪz/.",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "极度的厌恶感 (plural, and very uncommon)",
  "definition": "The plural form of 'disgustedness,' referring to multiple instances or a high degree of the state of being disgusted. This word is extremely rare and not generally accepted in formal English.",
  "example": "The series of betrayals led to a collection of disgustednesses within her, each more profound than the last. (This example highlights the rarity and potentially unnatural usage.)",
  "synonyms": ["revulsion", "aversions", "distastes", "repulsions", "displeasures", "repugnances"],
  "antonyms": ["pleasures", "delights", "likings", "affinities", "attractions", "admirations"],
  "usage": {
    "notes": "This word is extremely rare.  It is highly unlikely you will encounter it in normal usage.  It's formed by taking 'disgusted' (past participle/adjective), turning it into 'disgustedness' (a noun describing the state of being disgusted), and then pluralizing that noun.  The result is awkward and unnatural in most contexts. The singular form 'disgustedness' itself is uncommon, let alone the plural.",
    "rarity": "Extremely rare. Use with extreme caution (or avoid entirely). There are far better ways to express the idea of multiple instances of disgust.",
    "alternatives": "Consider using phrases like 'feelings of disgust,' 'expressions of revulsion,' or 'multiple moments of distaste' instead.",
    "grammatical_concerns": "While grammatically valid as a constructed noun, the word's sheer uncommonness makes it potentially confusing or jarring for readers/listeners."
