I was unable to find an exact match for the word "restriven" in common dictionaries or language resources. It is possible that "restriven" is a misspelling, a very rare word, a newly coined term, or specific to a particular context that is not widely documented.

I will provide a JSON format response, but due to the lack of information, I will fill it with placeholder data and explanations:

```json
{
  "word": "restriven",
  "phonetics": "Unknown",
  "part_of_speech": "Unknown",
  "translation": "Unknown",
  "definition": "This word is not found in standard dictionaries. It may be a misspelling, a rare word, or a term specific to a niche field.",
  "example": "Example sentence unavailable due to the word's obscurity.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "explanation": "Without a clear definition, providing usage examples in different tenses is not possible. This section would normally contain example sentences showing how the word is used in various contexts."
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [],
    "idioms": [],
     "explanation": "Since the word 'restriven' is not found in common usage, there are no idiomatic expressions or common phrases associated with it."
  }
}
```
