  "word": "subnaturalness",

  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "亚自然性 (物理学)",
  "definition": "In particle physics, subnaturalness refers to a theoretical concept where a parameter in a physical model is unexpectedly small compared to what is considered natural or expected based on the underlying theory. It is related to, but distinct from, the concept of naturalness, which addresses why certain parameters in the Standard Model of particle physics, such as the Higgs boson mass, are much smaller than the Planck scale despite quantum corrections that would seemingly push them to much higher values. Subnaturalness suggests an even finer degree of tuning or a deeper underlying mechanism that protects these parameters from large corrections.",
  "example": "The subnaturalness of certain parameters in the model suggests the existence of a hidden symmetry or a dynamical mechanism at play.",
