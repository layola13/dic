I was unable to find a definition or comprehensive analysis for the word "wagati." It is possible that this is a very specific or technical term, a proper noun, or perhaps a word that is not widely recognized in standard English dictionaries.

I can, however, create a JSON format analysis of the word "wagati," similar to your example for "what," but it will be based on assumptions and educated guesses about its possible meaning and usage:
