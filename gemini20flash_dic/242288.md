I could not find an exact match for the word "urned" in the dictionaries and resources I consulted. It is possible that "urned" is a misspelling, a rare word, a technical term not commonly included in standard dictionaries, or a recently coined word.

I can, however, provide you with a JSON format structure for what a word definition might look like, based on your example. Since "urned" appears to be related to "urn," I can create a sample structure based on that:

```json
{
  "word": "urned",
  "phonetics": "/ɜːrnd/",
  "part_of_speech": "adj.",
  "translation": "装在瓮里的；有瓮的",
  "definition": "Contained in an urn; having an urn.",
  "example": "The ashes of the deceased were urned.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [
      {
        "question": "Is the body urned after cremation?",
        "translation": "火化后尸体会被装在瓮里吗？"
      }
    ],
    "present_continuous": [
      {
        "question": "Why are the remains being urned?",
        "translation": "为什么要将遗骸装在瓮里？"
      }
    ],
    "simple_past": [
      {
        "question": "Was the treasure urned to protect it?",
        "translation": "宝藏被装在瓮里是为了保护它吗？"
      }
    ],
    "passive_voice": [
      {
        "example": "The remains were urned shortly after the ceremony.",
        "translation": "仪式结束后不久，遗骸就被装在瓮里。"
      }
    ]
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [],
    "idioms": []
  }
}
```

Note that this is an approximation based on the likely root word and common English usage patterns. If "urned" has a specialized meaning in a particular field, a more specific definition would be needed.
