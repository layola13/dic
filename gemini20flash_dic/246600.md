  "definition": "Warpage is the distortion of a flat surface.  In manufacturing, it refers to the deformation of a material from its original shape, often due to uneven stress or temperature during processes like molding or welding. It also can describe how the magnetic field of a black hole can bend spacetime around it, creating warpages.",
  "example": "The warpages in the plastic part made it unusable.",
