  "definition": "In options trading, devexity refers to the sensitivity of a portfolio's value to changes in the volatility of the underlying asset. Specifically, it measures the rate of change of the portfolio's Vega (the sensitivity of the portfolio's value to changes in volatility). A negative devexity indicates that the portfolio's value is more sensitive to decreases in volatility than to increases.",
  "example": "The portfolio manager needs to carefully monitor the devexity of the options portfolio to manage the risk associated with volatility changes.",
  "synonyms": ["negative convexity (related concept, but not directly synonymous as devexity specifically addresses volatility risk)"],
  "antonyms": ["convexity (in this context, indicating a positive relationship between volatility and portfolio value)"],
