  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "超常视力；超常辨别能力",
  "definition": "The ability to perceive differences in spatial relationships that are smaller than the spacing of the photoreceptors in the retina. It refers to the enhanced ability to detect minimal changes in sensory input, exceeding normal sensory acuity.",
  "example": "Humans possess hyperacuities that allow them to detect misalignments with remarkable precision, even when the displacement is smaller than the diameter of a single retinal receptor.",
  "synonyms": ["heightened acuity", "enhanced perception", "superior discrimination"],
  "antonyms": ["sensory impairment", "reduced acuity", "sensory deficit"],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "Hyperacuities are often studied in the context of visual perception but can also apply to other senses.",
