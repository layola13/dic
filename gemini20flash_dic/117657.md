Based on my search, "megor" doesn't seem to be a recognized English word. Therefore, I've created a JSON structure with null values for most fields, as I couldn't find valid information to populate them. If "megor" is a proper noun, a term from a specific field, or a misspelling, providing more context might help me offer a more accurate response.
