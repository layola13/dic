  "word": "overhardening",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "过度硬化",
  "definition": "The process of hardening something, especially metal, to an excessive degree. It can also refer to the condition of being excessively hard.",
  "example": "Overhardening of steel can lead to brittleness.",
  "synonyms": ["excessive hardening", "extreme hardening"],
  "antonyms": ["softening", "tempering"],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "context": "In metallurgy, overhardening refers to heating a metal to a high temperature and then cooling it rapidly, which can result in a metal that is too brittle.",
        "example": "The overhardening process made the tool bit prone to chipping."
      },
      {
        "context": "In the context of concrete, overhardening can refer to concrete that has cured too quickly, leading to cracking.",
        "example": "The rapid setting of the concrete caused overhardening and subsequent surface cracks."
      }
    ],
    "technical_usage": [
      {
        "context": "During the heat treatment of metals, avoiding overhardening is crucial to maintain the desired balance of hardness and toughness.",
        "example": "Careful control of the quenching process prevents overhardening of the alloy."
      },
      {
        "context": "In polymer chemistry, overhardening can occur in thermosetting resins if the curing process is not properly controlled.",
        "example": "Overhardening of the epoxy resin resulted in a brittle and inflexible final product."
