  "definition": "In the context of physics, particularly spectroscopy, 'Balmer' most commonly refers to Johann Jakob Balmer, a Swiss mathematician and physicist. He is best known for deriving an empirical formula (the Balmer series) that describes the wavelengths of the spectral lines of hydrogen. It can also refer to things named after him.",
