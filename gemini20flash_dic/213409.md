  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "超似然性 (一种统计学概念)",
  "definition": "In statistics, superlikelihood refers to a likelihood function that exhibits unusually high values for certain parameter estimates, potentially leading to overfitting or unreliable inference. It often occurs when the model is too complex for the available data or when there are issues with data quality or model specification.",
  "example": "The model suffered from superlikelihood issues due to the high dimensionality of the data and limited sample size.",
  "synonyms": [
    "overfitting",
    "high likelihood",
    "inflated likelihood"
  ],
  "antonyms": [
    "low likelihood",
    "poor fit"
  ],
  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "example": "Researchers noticed superlikelihood in their model, indicating potential overfitting.",
        "translation": "研究人员注意到他们的模型中存在超似然性，表明可能存在过度拟合。"
      },
      {
        "example": "To avoid superlikelihood, it is important to carefully select the model complexity and validate it with independent data.",
        "translation": "为了避免超似然性，重要的是仔细选择模型复杂度并使用独立数据进行验证。"

        "example": "Regularization techniques are often used to mitigate the effects of superlikelihood in statistical models.",

      {
        "example": "In machine learning, superlikelihood is analogous to overfitting, where the model learns the training data too well and performs poorly on unseen data.",
        "translation": "在机器学习中，超似然性类似于过度拟合，即模型过于了解训练数据，导致对未见过的数据表现不佳。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Cross-validation is a common technique to detect and prevent superlikelihood in machine learning models.",
