  "word": "ornithopappi",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": "noun (plural)",
  "translation": "Unknown; likely a term related to ornithology (study of birds) and potentially papillae (small nipple-like projections), perhaps referring to papillae-like structures in birds or a specific kind of bird feature, but without more context, the exact meaning cannot be determined.",
  "definition": "This word is obscure and doesn't appear in standard dictionaries. Based on its components ('ornitho-' related to birds and '-pappi' potentially related to papillae), a plausible (though speculative) definition would be:  'Structures resembling papillae found in or associated with birds.'  Without specific contextual information, this remains an educated guess.  Further research or contextual clues would be required to ascertain a precise definition.",
  "example": "Without more context, it's difficult to use 'ornithopappi' in a sentence. A hypothetical example: 'The researchers examined the intricate ornithopappi lining the nest of the hummingbird, noting their role in regulating temperature and humidity.'",
