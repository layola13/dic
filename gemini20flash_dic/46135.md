  "definition": "A monoterpene with the molecular formula C₁₀H₁₄. It is a naturally occurring aromatic organic compound. There are three isomers of cymene, differing in the relative positions of the methyl and isopropyl groups around the benzene ring: ortho-cymene, meta-cymene, and para-cymene. Para-cymene is the most common isomer in nature.",
