    "details": "The word 'fiasco' comes from the Italian word 'fiasco,' which means 'flask' or 'bottle.' The figurative sense of 'failure' arose in the 19th century, possibly from the story that Venetian glassblowers, when failing to make a bottle of good quality, would simply turn it into a common flask."
