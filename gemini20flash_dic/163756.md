  "example": "Adjusting the predelay on a reverb effect can help separate the vocals from the reverberant space, improving clarity.",

      {
        "description": "In audio production, predelays are commonly used with reverb and delay effects to control the perceived distance and size of the sound source within a virtual space.",
        "example": "By increasing the predelay, the listener perceives the sound as being further away from the reflecting surfaces."

      {
        "description": "Predelays can also be used creatively to create rhythmic effects or to emphasize certain parts of a sound.",
