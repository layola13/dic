I am unable to find the exact definition and usage of the word "no-balling" in the format you requested. It is possible that this is a very specialized term or a newly coined word.

However, I can provide you with a general idea of how it might be used based on the separate meanings of "no-ball" and the suffix "-ing," which often denotes an action or process. This is not a definitive JSON format response, but it should be helpful:

**Please Note:**

*   **Phonetics:** I have omitted the phonetics because the correct pronunciation would depend on the specific context and whether it's being used literally or figuratively.
*   **Part of Speech:** I have listed it as a verb (gerund/participle) because the "-ing" form typically functions as a verb in these cases.
*   **Translation and Definition:** These are based on the general understanding of "no-ball" combined with the action of "-ing."
*   **Usage:** The examples are constructed based on how the term might be used.

If you can provide more context on where you encountered this word, I might be able to refine the definition and provide a more accurate JSON response.
