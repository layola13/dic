I'll do my best to provide a detailed JSON format analysis for the word "bursten," similar to the example you gave for "what." However, "bursten" is not a standard English word. It might be a misspelling, a term from a specific field, or a word from another language. I will proceed assuming it might be a less common English word or a technical term. I will create a structure with fields that would be relevant for any word, and fill them in as best as I can, given the lack of readily available information.

```json

Key points to consider:

*   **Uncommon Word:** "Bursten" is not a recognized standard English word.
*   **Possible Misspelling:** It might be a misspelling of "burst" (past participle: burst).
*   **Technical Context:** It could be a technical term in a specific field, but without knowing the field, it's impossible to provide an accurate definition or usage examples.
*   **Speculative Analysis:** The JSON above provides a speculative analysis based on the assumption that "bursten" is related to the concept of "bursting." The example sentences and translations are highly unusual and should be treated with caution.

If you can provide more context (e.g., the field in which you encountered this word), I might be able to provide a more accurate analysis.
