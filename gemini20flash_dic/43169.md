I can certainly help you with that! However, please provide me with the word you would like me to define in JSON format. For example, you can request the definition for the word "example" as follows:

```json
{
  "word": "example"
}
```

Once you provide the word in the correct JSON format, I will generate a detailed analysis of the word, including its phonetics, part of speech, translation, definition, example sentences, synonyms, antonyms, common usages in different tenses, and phrases. I will present the information in the JSON format you requested.
