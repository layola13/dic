    "general_context": [
      {
        "example": "The experiment required a precise electrode placement, ensuring no other part of the equipment acted as an unintended anelectrode.",
        "translation": "该实验需要精确定位的电极，确保设备的任何其他部分都不会充当非预期的非电极。"
      },
      {
        "example": "When studying electrochemical reactions, it's crucial to differentiate between the electrode and any surrounding anelectrodes to avoid misinterpretation of results.",
