非常抱歉，我无法按照您提供的“what”单词的JSON格式来解析“potsdam”这个词。 “Potsdam”是一个专有名词，指德国的波茨坦市，它主要用作名词，没有像“what”这样的多种词性和复杂的用法。

如果我尝试将“potsdam”强行套用您提供的格式，会产生很多不准确和误导的信息。

但我可以提供关于“Potsdam”的一些基本信息，您可以根据需要进行参考：

```json

  "phonetics": "/ˈpɒtsdæm/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",

  "definition": "The capital city of the German state of Brandenburg, located on the Havel River, southwest of Berlin. It is known for its palaces, gardens, and historical significance, including the Potsdam Conference after World War II.",

      "built_by": "Frederick the Great",

    }
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [

      { "phrase": "Potsdam Agreement", "translation": "波茨坦协定" }
    ]
  }
}
```

请注意，这个JSON格式与您提供的“what”的格式有很大不同，因为它更适合描述一个地名词汇。
