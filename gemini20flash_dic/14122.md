Please provide the word you would like me to analyze in the JSON format you specified. I need the word to proceed. For example, you can send me:

```json
{
  "author": "example_word"
}
```

Once you provide the word, I will create a detailed JSON object containing its phonetics, part of speech, translation, definition, examples, synonyms, antonyms, usage in different tenses, and common phrases.
