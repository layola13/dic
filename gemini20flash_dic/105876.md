    "description": "Kitsch is often associated with mass culture and consumerism. It can be seen as a reaction against the elitism of high art, or as a form of nostalgia for simpler times.  Its appeal often lies in its accessibility and sentimentality, though it is frequently regarded as being in poor taste by critics and those with more refined aesthetic sensibilities. However, kitsch can also be appreciated ironically, as a form of camp, or for its humorous qualities.",
