    "non-refracting",
    "non-refractive",
    "diatropic"
  ],

    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "The unrefractive lens is used in specific optical instruments to avoid distortion.",
        "translation": "这种非折射透镜用于特定的光学仪器中，以避免失真。"
      },
      {
        "example": "In the experiment, the unrefractive properties of the substance were crucial for accurate measurements.",

    "technical_context": [
      {
        "example": "When light passes through an unrefractive medium, it travels in a straight line without changing direction.",
