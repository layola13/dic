  "definition": "In graph theory, precoloring refers to a partial coloring of a graph, where some vertices have already been assigned colors. The problem then becomes extending this partial coloring to a complete coloring of the graph, using a given number of colors or minimizing the number of colors needed.",
  "example": "The precoloring extension problem asks whether a given precoloring of a graph can be extended to a proper k-coloring.",

      {
        "example": "In the context of graph coloring, precoloring is used to set initial constraints on the colors of certain vertices.",
