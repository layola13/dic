  "definition": "While 'keeldrags' isn't a standard English word found in dictionaries, we can infer its meaning from its components. 'Keel' refers to the longitudinal structure along the base of a ship or boat, and 'drag' refers to the resistance experienced by an object moving through a fluid. Thus, 'keeldrags' likely describes the drag force acting on the keel of a vessel as it moves through the water.",
  "example": "The design of the keel significantly affects the keeldrags experienced by the sailboat.",
