COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The pandemic caused by COVID-19 has significantly impacted global health, economies, and daily life. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, and the disease can be fatal, especially for individuals with underlying health conditions.

COVID-19 is referenced in different tenses to describe various aspects, such as ongoing research efforts (present continuous), the impact it has had (present perfect), and future expectations (simple future). Additionally, the subjunctive mood is used to express hypothetical situations, while the passive voice focuses on actions taken in response to the pandemic. Common phrases and idioms have also emerged, such as "COVID-19 vaccine," "long COVID," and "new normal," reflecting the widespread impact of the disease on society.
