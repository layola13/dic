  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "预色散",
  "definition": "Predispersion refers to the deliberate introduction of chromatic dispersion in an optical transmission system before the optical signal is launched into the transmission fiber. It is used to compensate for the dispersion that accumulates during transmission, particularly in long-haul optical communication systems. By carefully managing dispersion, signal quality can be improved, allowing for higher data rates and longer transmission distances.",
  "example": "Predispersion is a technique used in optical communication to counteract the effects of chromatic dispersion.",
