**Important Considerations:**

*   **Language Origin:** "Ketua" is not inherently an English word. This analysis treats it as if it were an English word with the meaning of "leader."
*   **Context is Key:** If "ketua" is being used in an English context, it's vital to ensure the audience understands it's a loanword and what it signifies.
