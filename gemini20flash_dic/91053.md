Based on my search, "hustan" does not seem to be a standard English word. It might be a proper noun, a misspelling, or a term from a specialized field not widely indexed. Therefore, I am providing a JSON format with null values for most fields, as I cannot provide a detailed analysis without more information. If you have more context about the word "hustan," please provide it so I can offer a more accurate analysis.
