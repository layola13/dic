Kofta is a dish consisting of meatballs or dumplings, and the name comes from Persian origins. Koftas are made from ground meat—usually beef, chicken, lamb, or a mixture—and are combined with spices, herbs, and sometimes onions. There are many regional variations of kofta throughout the Middle East, the Mediterranean, and India. They can be grilled, fried, steamed, or simmered in a sauce.
