  "translation": "裂殖植物",
  "definition": "A plant that reproduces by fission, especially bacteria. It refers to a member of the Schizophyta, an obsolete taxonomic division that included bacteria and blue-green algae (now known as cyanobacteria). These organisms reproduce through cell division or fission.",
  "example": "Schizophytes, such as bacteria, are characterized by their simple cellular structure and reproduction through binary fission.",

    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "The study of schizophytes has greatly advanced our understanding of microbial life.",

      },
      {
        "example": "Historically, schizophytes were classified together due to their method of reproduction.",

      {
        "example": "In older classification systems, schizophytes included organisms now classified as bacteria and cyanobacteria.",
