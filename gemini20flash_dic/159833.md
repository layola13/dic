  "definition": "An organism, cell, or strain with a chromosome number that is three or more times the monoploid number. Polyhaploids can arise spontaneously or be induced in vitro from polyploids, such as by anther culture. Polyhaploids are useful in plant breeding because they allow for the rapid production of completely homozygous lines.",
