Please provide the word you would like me to analyze in the JSON format you specified. I need the `{terms}` value to proceed. For example, you can provide the request as:

```json
{
  "terms": "example"
}
```

Once you provide the word, I will generate a detailed JSON response that includes the word's phonetics, part of speech, translation, definition, example sentences, synonyms, antonyms, usage in different tenses, common phrases, and idioms.
