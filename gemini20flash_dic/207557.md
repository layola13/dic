  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "可刺激性，可诱发性",
  "definition": "The degree to which a person can produce a speech sound correctly when given focused support or cues. It refers to the ability to produce a target sound when given maximal cues.",
  "example": "The child demonstrated good stimulability for the /r/ sound, suggesting it would be amenable to therapy.",
  "synonyms": [
    "improvability",
    "modifiability",
    "responsiveness to cues"
  ],
  "antonyms": [
    "resistance to change",
    "unresponsiveness",
    "lack of modifiability"
  ],
  "usage": {
    "general_use": [
      {
        "context": "In speech pathology, stimulability is often assessed to determine if an individual is likely to benefit from speech therapy for a particular sound.",
        "example": "Assessing stimulability helps the therapist prioritize which sounds to target in therapy."
      },
      {
        "context": "Stimulability testing involves providing cues, models, and encouragement to help the individual produce the target sound correctly.",
        "example": "During the stimulability test, the clinician provided visual and auditory cues to elicit the correct production of the /s/ sound."
      }
    ],
    "assessment": [
      {
        "context": "High stimulability suggests that the individual may acquire the sound more quickly in therapy.",
        "example": "A high stimulability score indicates a greater potential for improvement with intervention."
      },
      {
        "context": "Low stimulability may indicate that the sound is deeply entrenched in the individual's error pattern and may require more intensive therapy.",
        "example": "Due to low stimulability, the therapist decided to focus on other sounds first."

      {
        "context": "Stimulability can influence therapy goals and techniques.",

      },
      {
        "context": "Therapists use stimulability data to select appropriate cues and strategies for facilitating sound production.",
        "example": "The therapist used tactile cues to capitalize on the child's stimulability for the /θ/ sound."

    "research": [
      {
        "context": "Stimulability is studied to understand the factors that influence speech sound acquisition.",

        "context": "Researchers investigate the effectiveness of different stimulability testing methods.",
