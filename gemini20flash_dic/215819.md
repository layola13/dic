  "translation": "合轴分枝",
  "definition": "A type of branching pattern in plants where the main stem stops growing and a lateral bud continues the growth. The main stem appears to be displaced to the side.",
  "example": "The sympode growth pattern is common in many plant species, allowing for lateral spread and increased light capture.",
  "synonyms": ["false axis", "pseudaxis"],

    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "Sympode branching is a characteristic feature used in plant identification.",

      {
        "example": "In a sympode, the lateral branches may eventually appear to be a continuation of the main stem.",
        "translation": "在合轴分枝中，侧枝最终可能看起来像是主干的延续。"

      {
        "example": "Many species of orchids exhibit sympode growth, with each new growth arising from the base of the previous one.",
        "translation": "许多兰花物种表现出合轴生长，每个新的生长都来自前一个的基部。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The rhizomes of some grasses show sympode branching, which helps in their spread across the ground.",
        "translation": "一些草的根茎显示出合轴分枝，这有助于它们在地面上的蔓延。"

    ],
    "comparative_examples": [
      {
        "example": "Unlike monopodial growth where the main stem continues to grow indefinitely, sympode growth involves the termination of the main stem and continuation by a lateral branch.",
        "translation": "与主茎无限生长的单轴生长不同，合轴生长涉及主茎的终止和侧枝的延续。"
