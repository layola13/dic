  "definition": "Quantities or components that remain after a process of subtraction, analysis, or division, that are not considered residuals or remainders. More broadly, elements that remain after a specific aspect has been removed.",
  "example": "In statistical modeling, isolating nonresiduals helps identify the systematic effects driving the phenomena of interest. The nonresiduals in the equation represent all variables left after extracting the residuals.",
