  "definition": "Superassertions, often used in the context of computer science and formal verification, refer to extremely strong or comprehensive assertions about the behavior of a system or program. These assertions go beyond basic checks and aim to capture deep properties and invariants of the system, ensuring its correctness under a wide range of conditions.",
  "example": "The formal verification process relied on superassertions to guarantee the system's resilience against various fault scenarios.",

      {
        "example": "In the design of safety-critical systems, superassertions are crucial for ensuring that the system behaves correctly even in unexpected situations.",
