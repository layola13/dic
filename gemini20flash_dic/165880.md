  "definition": "In the context of WASI (WebAssembly System Interface) and similar sandboxed environments, 'preopens' refer to file descriptors that are preconfigured to grant access to specific directories or files. This allows a program running in the sandbox to access these files without needing to explicitly request permission at runtime.  They are critical for secure and efficient resource access.",
  "example": "The WASI runtime preopens the `/` directory, allowing the WebAssembly module to access files within that directory (subject to the limitations set by the preopen configuration).",

  "antonyms": ["restricted access", "unreachable files"],

        "description": "Preopens are used to grant specific file and directory access to sandboxed programs.",

      {
        "description": "They enhance security by limiting the program's access to only the necessary resources.",
        "example": "Instead of giving a program full filesystem access, you can use preopens to restrict it to only its configuration directory and data directory."

        "description": "The `__wasi_fd_prestat_get` function is used to retrieve information about preopened file descriptors.",

        "description": "They are important for creating isolated and reproducible environments.",
