  "translation": "缓动函数",
  "definition": "In animation and computer graphics, easings are functions that specify the rate of change of a parameter over time. They are used to make animations appear more natural and fluid by varying the speed of the animation, rather than keeping it constant.",
  "example": "The animation used an ease-in-out easing to start and end smoothly.",
  "synonyms": ["tweening functions", "interpolation functions"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general_use": [
      {
        "description": "Easing functions are commonly used in web development (CSS, JavaScript), game development, and motion graphics to control the animation of elements.",
        "example": "CSS transitions and animations can use easing functions to create smooth effects."
      },
      {
        "description": "They determine how intermediate values between two keyframes are calculated, influencing the perceived speed and smoothness of the animation.",
        "example": "By applying different easing functions, the same animation can look drastically different."

      {
        "type": "Linear",

        "type": "Ease-In",
        "description": "An ease-in easing starts slowly and accelerates towards the end.",

      },
      {
        "type": "Ease-Out",
        "description": "An ease-out easing starts quickly and decelerates towards the end.",
        "example": "An ease-out easing is used to make an object smoothly come to a stop."
      },
      {
        "type": "Ease-In-Out",
        "description": "An ease-in-out easing combines both ease-in and ease-out, starting slowly, accelerating in the middle, and decelerating towards the end.",
        "example": "An ease-in-out easing is often preferred for a natural, smooth animation."

        "type": "Specific_Functions",
        "description": "Cubic, Quadratic, Sine, Exponential, and Circular are specific mathematical functions often used for easing.",
