I'll do my best to provide a comprehensive JSON format analysis for the word "cappadine," similar to the example you gave for "what." However, "cappadine" does not appear to be a standard English word. It is possible that it could be a misspelling, a technical term, a proper noun, or a word from another language. I will proceed assuming it might be a technical or specialized term and try to provide relevant information if available.

**Explanation of the fields and the challenges faced:**

*   **word**: The word being analyzed, which is "cappadine."
*   **phonetics**: Due to the word's obscurity, a standard phonetic transcription is not available. I've indicated a possible pronunciation based on similar-sounding words, but this is speculative.
*   **part\_of\_speech**: It is unclear what part of speech "cappadine" is without further context.
*   **translation**: A direct translation is unavailable because the word is not in standard dictionaries.
*   **definition**: A standard definition cannot be provided.
*   **example**: It's challenging to provide example sentences without a clear understanding of the word's meaning.
*   **synonyms** & **antonyms**: Without a clear definition, providing synonyms and antonyms is not possible.
*   **usage**: Since the word's meaning and part of speech are unclear, I cannot generate example sentences in different tenses or moods.
*   **phrases**: Similarly, I cannot provide common phrases or idioms using this word.

If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word (e.g., in a scientific article, a novel, etc.), I might be able to refine this analysis and provide more accurate information.
