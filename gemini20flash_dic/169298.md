  "definition": "Belonging to or related to the degree or quality of being promising; the degree to which something shows signs of future success or is likely to develop in a positive way. Since this is a possessive form, the actual thing 'possessed' is unknown without context.",

    "notes": [
      "This word form ('promisingness's') is extremely rare and grammatically awkward.  It's formed by making the already relatively uncommon noun 'promisingness' possessive.  In most cases, rephrasing the sentence to avoid this possessive construction is strongly recommended.",
      "Instead of 'The project's promisingness's assessment...', consider rephrasing to 'The assessment of the project's promisingness...' or, even better, 'The assessment of the project's potential...'.",
      "The term 'promisingness' itself is already somewhat formal; using it in a possessive form makes the sentence sound even more stilted.",
      "If used, it implies something belongs to or is related to the *degree* of promisingness, not the thing that is promising.",
      "Avoid using 'promisingness's' if at all possible. It's better to use 'promisingness' and rewrite the sentence to avoid the possessive form."
