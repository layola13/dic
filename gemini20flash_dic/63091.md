I'll do my best to create a detailed JSON format analysis for the word "enseel" as you requested. However, it seems there might be a slight typo in the word. Did you perhaps mean "ensile"? Or is "enseel" the correct word?

I will proceed assuming the word is "enseel," but if you meant "ensile," please let me know, and I’ll adjust accordingly.
