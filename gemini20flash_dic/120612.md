I was unable to find an exact match for the word "miryachit" in English dictionaries or common language resources. It is possible that this is a misspelling, a word from a less common dialect, or a word from another language.

I can, however, offer a JSON format analysis based on common linguistic structures and assuming it's an English-like word, but without confirmed definitions. Note that this is speculative:

```json

      {

      }
    ]
  },

    ]

```
