  "definition": "Eka-aluminium is a name used by Dmitri Mendeleev in his periodic table for the element gallium before its discovery. Mendeleev used prefixes eka-, dvi-, and tri- (Sanskrit for one, two, and three) to name predicted elements. He predicted the existence of ekaluminium in 1869, and in 1871, he predicted several of its properties. In 1875, gallium was discovered by Lecoq de Boisbaudran. The properties of gallium were found to be close to those predicted by Mendeleev.",
