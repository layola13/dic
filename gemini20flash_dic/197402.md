  "etymology": {
    "origin": "The origin of the word \"shebang\" is uncertain, but it is thought to have originated in the United States in the mid-19th century.  One popular theory suggests that it comes from the Irish phrase 'shebeen shop,' referring to an illegal drinking establishment, implying the whole operation.  Another theory links it to nautical slang or a term used during the Civil War, but these are less substantiated. The evolution of its meaning has shifted to represent 'the whole kit and caboodle' or everything associated with a particular situation."
