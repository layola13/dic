  "word": "cloudlifter",
  "phonetics": "/ˈklaʊdˌlɪftər/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "麦克风信号放大器",
  "definition": "A device that boosts the signal of a microphone, typically a dynamic or ribbon microphone, before it reaches the preamplifier. It uses phantom power from a mixer or audio interface to provide clean gain, improving the signal-to-noise ratio and reducing the need for excessive gain from the preamplifier.",
  "example": "Using a cloudlifter with my SM7B drastically improved the clarity and signal strength of my vocals.",
  "synonyms": ["microphone activator", "preamplifier booster", "signal booster"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general_use": [
      {
        "sentence": "The cloudlifter provides a clean gain boost for dynamic microphones.",
        "translation": "麦克风信号放大器为动圈麦克风提供干净的增益提升。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "Many podcasters use a cloudlifter with their Shure SM7B microphones.",
        "translation": "许多播客制作者将麦克风信号放大器与他们的舒尔SM7B麦克风一起使用。"
      }
    ],
    "technical_context": [
      {
        "sentence": "A cloudlifter increases the signal-to-noise ratio by providing gain before the preamplifier.",
        "translation": "麦克风信号放大器通过在前置放大器之前提供增益来提高信噪比。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "The cloudlifter requires phantom power but does not pass it through to the microphone.",
        "translation": "麦克风信号放大器需要幻象电源，但不会将其传递给麦克风。"
      }

    "comparisons": [
      {
        "sentence": "Unlike a preamp, a cloudlifter only boosts the signal, it doesn't shape the tone.",
        "translation": "与前置放大器不同，麦克风信号放大器仅提升信号，不会塑造音调。"
      },
      {
        "sentence": "A cloudlifter is a passive device, while many preamps offer active amplification.",
        "translation": "麦克风信号放大器是一个无源设备，而许多前置放大器提供有源放大。"
