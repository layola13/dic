I've looked for detailed information and examples for the word "amon" to present in JSON format. Unfortunately, "amon" doesn't have a standard dictionary entry as a common English word. It's possible it could be a proper noun, a term from a specific field, or a less common word.

However, "Amon" is a significant name in Egyptian mythology. Amon was an important god in ancient Egypt, particularly revered in Thebes. He was often associated with the sun and air and was eventually merged with the god Ra to become Amon-Ra, representing the supreme deity.

Given this, here's a JSON structure focusing on the mythological context.
