I'll do my best to provide a detailed breakdown of the word "unsparser" in JSON format, similar to your example for the word "what." However, it's worth noting that "unsparser" is not a commonly recognized English word. It is likely a technical term or a neologism (a newly coined word). Therefore, the information I can provide will be based on the likely construction and potential usage of the word.
