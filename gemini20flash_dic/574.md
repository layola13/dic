**Important Notes Regarding `abot`:**

*   **Archaic Word:** The word `abot` is **extremely rare and archaic**. It is not commonly used in modern English.  It's found in older texts but would sound very strange in contemporary conversation.
*   **Usage Examples Reflect Archaic Nature:** The usage examples provided in the JSON are constructed to *attempt* to show the grammatical possibilities. However, it is important to understand that a native English speaker today would almost never use `abot` in this way. More common alternatives like `abolish`, `repeal`, `end`, or `cease` would be used instead.
*   **Passive voice:**  The passive voice examples are the *most* likely (relatively speaking!) way you might encounter *mention* of the word `abot` itself, describing the *fact* that it's no longer in use.
*  **重点:** 除非您在阅读古文， 否则不要尝试使用这个单词。
