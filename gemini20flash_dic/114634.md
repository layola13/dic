It might be a misspelling or a neologism (a newly coined word). Without a specific context, it's difficult to provide a definitive definition. If 'malest' is intended to relate to 'male,' it could theoretically be a superlative form, though grammatically incorrect. Here are a few hypothetical interpretations:",
