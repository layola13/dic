I'll do my best to provide a detailed JSON format analysis for the word "pre-acidness". However, it seems that "pre-acidness" is not a standard or widely recognized English word. It is possible that this is a newly coined term, a technical term used in a specific field, or simply a rare word. Due to its limited usage, it's difficult to provide a comprehensive analysis with example sentences and common usages.

I will, however, provide a JSON structure that breaks down the word based on its morphology (the structure and form of words), and provide potential meanings based on its components: "pre-" (prefix), "acid" (root word), and "-ness" (suffix).

```json
{
  "word": "pre-acidness",
  "phonetics": "Based on pronunciation rules, likely /ˌpriːˈæsɪdnəs/",
  "part_of_speech": "Noun (likely)",
  "translation": "The state or condition of being acidic prior to a certain point or process.",
  "definition": "This word is likely a neologism. Based on its components: 'pre-' indicates 'before,' 'acid' relates to acidity, and '-ness' turns it into a noun describing a state or quality. Thus, it likely refers to the state of being acidic before a certain point, measurement, or process. It could refer to the initial acidity level of a substance before treatment, or a predicted acidity level.",
  "example": "The pre-acidness of the soil sample was measured to determine the amount of lime needed.",

    "initial acidity",
    "baseline acidity",
    "original acidity"
