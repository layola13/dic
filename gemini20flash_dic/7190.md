  "translation": "血管成形术",
  "definition": "A surgical procedure used to widen narrowed or blocked blood vessels, typically arteries, that supply blood to the heart or other organs.  It usually involves inserting a catheter with a deflated balloon on its tip into the affected vessel. The balloon is then inflated to compress the plaque against the artery walls, widening the artery and restoring blood flow. Sometimes a stent is inserted to keep the artery open.",
  "example": "The patient underwent angioplasty to open a blocked artery after experiencing chest pain.",
