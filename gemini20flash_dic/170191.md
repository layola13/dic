  "part_of_speech": "Noun (Hypothetical)",
  "translation": "No direct translation; assumed Latin-esque coinage referring to a proto/early form of a fossil/something related to fossils.",
  "definition": "As a hypothetical word, its definition is uncertain. One could interpret it as 'proto' (early/preliminary) combined with a suffix '-silius' suggestive of 'fossil' or 'related to fossils'. Thus, it *might* refer to an early stage of a fossil formation, a very primitive fossil type, or a hypothetical ancestor of fossils.",
  "example": "Scientists hypothesized that 'protossilius' represented the precursor to all known trilobites, predating the Cambrian explosion.",
