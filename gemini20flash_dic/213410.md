  "definition": "While 'likelihood' refers to the probability of observing a particular outcome given a set of parameters, 'superlikelihoods' (though not a standard term) might imply likelihoods that are exceptionally high, significant, or amplified in some way. It could also refer to a situation where multiple likelihoods are combined or considered together to produce an even stronger indication or conclusion.",
