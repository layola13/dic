  "translation": "转换；摄取；圣餐化体",
  "definition": "Transumption refers to several distinct concepts depending on the field of study:\n\n1.  **Theological Context:** In theology, particularly within certain interpretations of the Eucharist or Holy Communion, transumption describes the complete change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of Christ. This is related to, but distinct from, transubstantiation.\n\n2.  **Literary Criticism:** In literary theory, especially associated with the work of Harold Bloom, transumption is a concept related to poetic influence. It describes how a poet alters or reinterprets the work of a predecessor to clear imaginative space for their own creative expression. It involves a complex interplay of influence, misreading, and creative revision.\n\n3.  **General Sense of Transformation or Assimilation:** More broadly, transumption can refer to a process of transformation, assimilation, or taking up of one thing into another.",
  "example": "In Bloom's theory, a poet's transumption of earlier works is a necessary act of creative self-assertion.",
