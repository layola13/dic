  "definition": "In soil mechanics, overconsolidation refers to the condition where a soil has experienced a higher effective stress in the past than it is currently experiencing. This past stress is known as the preconsolidation pressure or maximum past pressure.",
  "example": "The overconsolidation ratio (OCR) is a key parameter in determining the behavior of soil under loading.",
