  "definition": "The absence or lack of palatalization. Palatalization is a phonological process in which a consonant changes its place of articulation to become closer to the palate, often under the influence of a following front vowel (like /i/ or /e/). Nonpalatalization, therefore, refers to cases where this expected shift does not occur.",
  "example": "The nonpalatalization of /k/ before /i/ in certain dialects distinguishes them from others where /k/ becomes /tʃ/ (as in 'kitchen').",
