        "note": "This is a grammatically complex and unusual form. It's a double possessive, indicating something belonging to the 'friendlessness' of someone. It's rare to see this in common usage.",
        "example": "Using a construction like 'the effect of his friendlessness' is more typical."

      {
        "explanation": "'Friendlessness' is a noun referring to the state of not having friends. Adding 's' makes it possessive. The additional 's' is highly unusual and marks a double possessive, implying something that belongs to or is a characteristic *of* the friendlessness itself.",
        "example": "A more common possessive form of friendlessness would be 'friendlessness'.  The additional possessive is non-standard."
