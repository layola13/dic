  "definition": "Plural form of myeloma; a type of cancer that occurs in plasma cells (a type of white blood cell). Plasma cells help you fight infections by making antibodies that recognize and attack germs. Myeloma causes cancer cells to accumulate in the bone marrow, where they crowd out healthy blood cells. Rather than produce helpful antibodies, the cancer cells produce abnormal proteins that can cause complications.",
