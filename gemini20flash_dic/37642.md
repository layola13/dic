  "definition": "In mathematics and physics, commutators represent the extent to which two operations or operators fail to commute (i.e., their order matters). In group theory, the commutator of two elements g and h in a group G, denoted [g, h], is defined as [g, h] = g⁻¹h⁻¹gh. In quantum mechanics, the commutator of two operators A and B acting on a Hilbert space is defined as [A, B] = AB - BA.",
