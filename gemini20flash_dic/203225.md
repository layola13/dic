I'll do my best to provide a comprehensive JSON format breakdown for the word "sosing," similar to the example you provided for "what." However, please note that "sosing" doesn't appear to be a standard English word. I will treat it as a made-up word and provide some illustrative content, but the translation, definition, and usage examples will be hypothetical.
