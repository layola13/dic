I'll do my best to provide a detailed JSON format analysis for the word "unexecuting." However, it is important to note that "unexecuting" is not a commonly recognized or standard English word. It is likely a technical term or a neologism (newly coined word). Therefore, the information provided below will be based on its likely meaning derived from its component parts ("un-" + "executing").
