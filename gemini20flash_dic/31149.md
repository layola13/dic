I am sorry, but I was unable to find an exact match for the word "chander" in common English dictionaries. It is possible that this is a proper noun, a term from a specialized field, a misspelling, or a word from another language. I can, however, provide a JSON format as you request based on the structure you provided:

```json
{
  "word": "chander",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": null,
  "translation": null,
  "definition": "I am sorry, but I was unable to find a definition for the word 'chander'.",
  "example": null,
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {},
  "phrases": {}
}
```

If you have more context about the word "chander," such as the field it might be used in or the language it might come from, I may be able to provide a more accurate definition.
