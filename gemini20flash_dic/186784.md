I am sorry, but I could not find enough information to create a detailed JSON object for the word "rimbase" like the example you provided for "what." It is possible this is a highly specialized or newly coined term. I can offer you a basic structure with limited information.

```json
{
  "word": "rimbase",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": null,
  "translation": null,
  "definition": null,
  "example": null,
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {},
  "phrases": {}
}
```

If you have more context about where you encountered this word or what field it belongs to, I might be able to refine my search and provide a more useful result.
