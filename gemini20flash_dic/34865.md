  "phonetics": "/ˌklaɪnəˈrɒmbɪk/",
  "part_of_speech": "adj.",
  "translation": "单斜的",
  "definition": "Belonging to the monoclinic crystal system; having three unequal axes with one oblique intersection.",
  "example": "The mineral sample was identified as clinorhombic based on its crystal structure.",
  "synonyms": ["monoclinic"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "context": "In crystallography, the term 'clinorhombic' describes a crystal system characterized by specific symmetry elements and axial relationships.",
        "explanation": "This term is primarily used in the field of mineralogy and crystallography to classify crystals based on their structure."
      },
      {
        "context": "Clinorhombic crystals have one twofold axis of symmetry, a single plane of symmetry, or a center of symmetry.",
        "explanation": "These symmetry elements define the monoclinic (clinorhombic) crystal system."
      }
    ],
    "scientific_context": [
      {
        "example": "Many silicate minerals, such as certain types of feldspars and pyroxenes, crystallize in the clinorhombic system.",
        "explanation": "This indicates that their atomic structure conforms to the symmetry and axial properties of the monoclinic system."
      },
      {
        "example": "X-ray diffraction is used to confirm whether a crystal is clinorhombic by analyzing its diffraction pattern.",
        "explanation": "X-ray diffraction patterns provide detailed information about the crystal's internal structure and symmetry."
