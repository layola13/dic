  "definition": "A unit of measurement of the optical power of a lens or curved mirror, which is equal to the reciprocal of the focal length measured in meters (i.e. 1/focal length). It is commonly used to specify the correction needed for eyesight, such as for glasses or contact lenses.",
  "example": "The prescription for my glasses is -2.5 dioptres in both eyes.",

        "example": "Contact lenses are prescribed based on dioptres to correct vision.",
