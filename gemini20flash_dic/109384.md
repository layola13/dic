  "definition": "A lenticel is a porous tissue consisting of cells with large intercellular spaces in the periderm of woody stems and roots of dicotyledonous flowering plants. It functions as a pore, providing a pathway for the direct exchange of gases between the internal tissues and the atmosphere through the bark, which is otherwise impermeable to gases.",
