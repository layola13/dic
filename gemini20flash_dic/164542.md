  "definition": "Preevaded is not a standard English word. It seems to be a combination of 'pre-' (meaning before) and 'evaded' (meaning avoided or escaped). Thus, 'preevaded' would mean 'avoided beforehand' or 'escaped in advance'. It could also mean 'permeated beforehand,' combining 'pre-' with a modified form of 'pervaded.'",
  "example": "Since 'preevaded' is not a standard word, an example would need to be constructed. Hypothetically: 'The company preevaded potential financial risks by diversifying its investments early on.'",
