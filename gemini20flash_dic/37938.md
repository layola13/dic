**Explanation of the Fields:**

*   **word**: The English word being analyzed (e.g., "example").
*   **phonetics**: The phonetic transcription of the word's pronunciation (e.g., "/ɪɡˈzæmpl/").
*   **part\_of\_speech**: The grammatical category or categories the word belongs to (e.g., "noun, verb").
*   **translation**: A brief translation of the word into Chinese (e.g., "例子").
*   **definition**: A concise definition of the word's meaning (e.g., "A thing that is characteristic of its kind or illustrates a general rule.").
*   **example**: A typical example of the word used in a sentence (e.g., "An apple is an example of a fruit.").
*   **synonyms**: A list of words with similar meanings (e.g., \["instance", "sample"]).
*   **antonyms**: A list of words with opposite meanings (e.g., \["counterexample"]).
*   **usage**: A detailed breakdown of how the word is used in different tenses and sentence structures.  Each tense (e.g., "simple\_present", "past\_continuous") will contain a list of objects, each with a "question" (or "example") field (the English sentence) and a "translation" field (the Chinese translation). The `subjunctive_mood`, `passive_voice`, `interrogative_sentences`, and `negative_sentences` keys follow this structure.
*   **phrases**: A collection of common phrases, idioms, or expressions that use the word. The `examples` key will show example usages, and the `idioms` key will show idioms. Each of these keys will contain a list of objects, each with a "phrase" field (the phrase itself) and a "translation" field (the Chinese translation).

**How to Use This Template:**

1.  **Replace** `{completion}` with the actual word you want to analyze.
2.  **Fill in** the `phonetics`, `part_of_speech`, `translation`, `definition`, `example`, `synonyms`, and `antonyms` fields with the appropriate information.
3.  **Populate** the `usage` section with example sentences in different tenses and sentence structures, along with their Chinese translations.
4.  **Add** any relevant phrases, idioms, or expressions to the `phrases` section, including their Chinese translations.

I'm ready to perform the analysis when you provide the word.
