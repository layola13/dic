  "phonetics": "/ˌɪntərkənˈfaʊndɪŋ/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "互混",
  "definition": "In statistics, interconfounding refers to a situation in experimental designs where the effects of two or more factors or variables cannot be separated or independently estimated. This occurs when the levels of these factors are systematically varied together, making it impossible to determine the unique contribution of each factor to the observed outcome.",
  "example": "In a factorial experiment, if certain combinations of factors are always tested together, interconfounding can occur, making it difficult to isolate the individual effects of each factor.",
  "synonyms": ["confounding", "aliasing"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "example": "Interconfounding can lead to biased estimates of treatment effects.",
        "translation": "互混可能导致对治疗效果的有偏差估计。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Careful experimental design is necessary to avoid interconfounding.",
        "translation": "需要仔细的实验设计以避免互混。"
      }

    "factorial_experiments": [
      {
        "example": "In a 2x2 factorial design, interconfounding might occur if the interaction effect is aliased with a block effect.",
        "translation": "在2x2因子设计中，如果交互作用效应与区组效应混淆，则可能发生互混。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Fractional factorial designs intentionally use interconfounding to reduce the number of runs required.",
        "translation": "部分因子设计有意使用互混来减少所需的运行次数。"
      }

    "statistical_analysis": [
      {
        "example": "When interconfounding is present, statistical models may not accurately estimate the true effects of each factor.",
        "translation": "当存在互混时，统计模型可能无法准确估计每个因素的真实影响。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Researchers must be aware of potential interconfounding when interpreting the results of their experiments.",
