**Important Considerations:**

*   **Rarity:** As I mentioned, "supersolicit" doesn't appear to be a common word. The above is based on combining the meaning of "super-" (excessive) with "solicit."
*   **Usage:** The example sentences are constructed to illustrate potential uses, but they might not reflect actual, common usage.
*   **Nuance:** The word likely carries a negative connotation, implying that the solicitation is annoying or overbearing.

If you have any more context about where you encountered this word, it might help me refine the definition and examples.
