  "translation": "低音炮效应，超低频噪音干扰",
  "definition": "Subwoofing refers to the phenomenon where low-frequency noise (typically below the audible range for humans) causes disturbances or interference, often affecting electronic devices. It can also refer to the use of subwoofers to intentionally create very low-frequency sounds. In some contexts, it describes a type of audio interference or a technique used in security attacks.",
  "example": "The subwoofing from the nearby construction site disrupted the sensitive equipment in the lab.",

    "low-frequency interference",
    "infrasound disturbance",
    "low-frequency noise pollution"
