  "translation": "序数论",
  "definition": "Ordinalism is an economic theory that contends that individual preferences can be ordered, but that the differences between these preferences cannot be quantified. In other words, it is possible to say that one prefers A to B, but not by how much.",
  "example": "Ordinalism is a core concept in modern microeconomics, influencing how economists model consumer behavior.",
  "synonyms": ["preference ordering", "ordinal utility"],
  "antonyms": ["cardinalism"],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "Ordinalism is used in economics to describe consumer choice without assigning specific values to satisfaction levels.",
        "translation": "序数论在经济学中用于描述消费者选择，而不为满意度分配具体数值。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The shift from cardinalism to ordinalism in the early 20th century revolutionized utility theory.",
        "translation": "20世纪初从基数论到序数论的转变彻底改变了效用理论。"

      {
        "example": "In microeconomics, ordinalism allows economists to model consumer behavior based on ranked preferences rather than measurable utility.",

      },
      {
        "example": "Indifference curves, a tool in microeconomics, are based on ordinalism, showing combinations of goods that a consumer ranks equally.",
        "translation": "无差异曲线是微观经济学中的一种工具，它基于序数论，显示了消费者认为同等重要的商品组合。"

    "consumer_behavior": [
      {
        "example": "Ordinalism is crucial in understanding consumer behavior as it acknowledges that individuals can rank their choices without needing to quantify the utility derived from each.",
        "translation": "序数论在理解消费者行为方面至关重要，因为它承认个人可以对他们的选择进行排序，而不需要量化从每个选择中获得的效用。"

      {
        "example": "Marketing strategies often take ordinal preferences into account, focusing on positioning products in a way that appeals to consumers' ranked priorities.",

      {
        "example": "When creating economic models, ordinalism simplifies the process by focusing on the relative ranking of preferences rather than absolute utility values.",

      },
      {
        "example": "Ordinalism is preferred by many economists because it aligns with the practical difficulty of measuring individual satisfaction on a cardinal scale.",
        "translation": "序数论受到许多经济学家的青睐，因为它符合在基数尺度上衡量个人满意度的实际困难。"
