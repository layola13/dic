I was unable to find any information for the word "jermoonal." It is possible that it is misspelled, is a very new word, or is a specialized term not found in standard dictionaries or online resources. I can, however, create the JSON format you requested using placeholder information.

```json
{
  "word": "jermoonal",
  "phonetics": null,
  "part_of_speech": null,
  "translation": null,
  "definition": "No definition found for this word.",
  "example": null,
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {},
  "phrases": {}
}
```
