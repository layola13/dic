  "word": "cosurfactants",
  "phonetics": "/ˌkoʊsərˈfæktənts/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "助表面活性剂",
  "definition": "Substances that, when used in conjunction with a surfactant, enhance the surfactant's ability to lower surface tension, solubilize materials, or form microemulsions.  They are typically amphiphilic molecules that, unlike surfactants, cannot form micelles on their own.",
  "example": "Alcohols such as butanol and pentanol are commonly used as cosurfactants in microemulsion formulations.",
  "synonyms": [
    "co-surfactants",
    "auxiliary surfactants",
    "emulsion stabilizers"
  ],
  "antonyms": [
    "surfactants (used alone)",
    "oil",
    "water"
  ],
  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "example": "Cosurfactants play a crucial role in stabilizing microemulsions by partitioning between the oil and water phases and reducing interfacial tension.",
        "translation": "助表面活性剂通过在油水相之间分配并降低界面张力，在稳定微乳液中发挥着关键作用。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The choice of cosurfactant depends on the specific surfactant and the desired properties of the final formulation.",
        "translation": "助表面活性剂的选择取决于特定的表面活性剂和最终配方的期望性能。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Higher alcohol cosurfactants often lead to more stable and efficient microemulsions.",
        "translation": "较高醇类的助表面活性剂通常会带来更稳定有效的微乳液。"
      }
    ],
    "specific_applications": [
      {
        "example": "In enhanced oil recovery, cosurfactants are used to reduce the interfacial tension between oil and water, allowing for greater oil mobilization.",
        "translation": "在提高采油率方面，助表面活性剂用于降低油水之间的界面张力，从而实现更大的油动用性。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Pharmaceutical formulations often utilize cosurfactants to improve the solubility and bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs.",
        "translation": "药物制剂通常利用助表面活性剂来提高难溶药物的溶解度和生物利用度。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Cosmetics and personal care products employ cosurfactants in cleaning and emulsifying formulations.",
        "translation": "化妆品和个人护理产品在清洁和乳化配方中使用助表面活性剂。"
