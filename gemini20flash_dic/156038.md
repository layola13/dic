  "definition": "A photomixer is a semiconductor device used to generate terahertz (THz) radiation through the photomixing process. It typically consists of two closely spaced electrodes on a semiconductor substrate, illuminated by two lasers with slightly different frequencies. The beating of the two lasers generates an oscillating current that emits THz radiation.",
  "example": "Photomixers are crucial components in terahertz imaging and spectroscopy systems.",
