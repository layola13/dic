I was unable to find a standard English word spelled "outhumor." It's possible that it is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a term specific to a particular context that is not widely documented.

I will provide you with the JSON format you requested for the word "outhumor," but please note that the information within is based on educated assumptions about what the word might mean if it were a valid English term related to "humor," and therefore may not be accurate.
