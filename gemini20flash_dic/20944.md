  "word": "bleeder-resistor",
  "phonetics": "N/A",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "泄放电阻",
  "definition": "A bleeder resistor is a resistor used to discharge a capacitor or to provide a current drain to maintain a desired voltage level in a circuit.",
  "example": "The bleeder resistor in the power supply ensures that the capacitor is discharged after the equipment is turned off, preventing electrical shock.",
  "synonyms": ["discharge resistor", "ballast resistor"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "typical_applications": [
      {
        "context": "High-voltage power supplies",
        "description": "In high-voltage power supplies, bleeder resistors are used to safely discharge capacitors after the power is turned off. This prevents potentially dangerous voltage from remaining in the circuit.",
        "example": "After the X-ray machine is powered down, the bleeder resistor dissipates the stored energy in the capacitor bank."
      },
      {
        "context": "Voltage regulation",
        "description": "Bleeder resistors can also be used to provide a minimum load current to improve voltage regulation in certain types of power supplies. By ensuring a constant current draw, the output voltage remains stable even when the main load is disconnected.",
        "example": "In a shunt regulator, the bleeder resistor ensures that there is always some current flowing through the Zener diode, even when the load is minimal, thus maintaining a stable output voltage."
      },
      {
        "context": "Capacitor discharge",
        "description": "Used to discharge capacitors in circuits where stored charge could cause issues. This is common in devices that need to be serviced or are sensitive to residual voltage.",
        "example": "The bleeder resistor across the large capacitor in the amplifier discharges it when the amp is turned off, preventing a thump sound when the amp is next used."

    "considerations": [
      {
        "aspect": "Power rating",
        "description": "The bleeder resistor must be able to handle the power dissipated during discharge or continuous operation. The power rating should be calculated based on the voltage across the resistor and the current flowing through it.",
        "example": "For a 400V power supply with a 100kΩ bleeder resistor, the power dissipation is P = V^2 / R = 400^2 / 100000 = 1.6W. A resistor with a power rating of at least 2W should be used."
      },
      {
        "aspect": "Resistance value",
        "description": "The resistance value affects the discharge time and the current drain. A lower resistance value will discharge the capacitor more quickly but will also draw more current continuously.",
        "example": "Choosing a 10kΩ bleeder resistor instead of a 100kΩ resistor will discharge the capacitor ten times faster but will also draw ten times more current when the power supply is on."
      },
      {
        "aspect": "Safety",
        "description": "Bleeder resistors enhance safety by removing dangerous voltage levels when equipment is not in use.",
        "example": "Including a bleeder resistor in a high-voltage device ensures that service technicians will not be exposed to dangerous voltages when performing maintenance."
