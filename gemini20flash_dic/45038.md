OK. I will parse the English word "{ctx}" according to the format of the word "what" and return it in JSON format.

```json
{
  "word": "{ctx}",
  "phonetics": "Unknown",
  "part_of_speech": "Unknown",
  "translation": "Unknown",
  "definition": "Unknown",
  "example": "Unknown",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [],
    "present_continuous": [],
    "present_perfect": [],
    "present_perfect_continuous": [],
    "simple_past": [],
    "past_continuous": [],
    "past_perfect": [],
    "past_perfect_continuous": [],
    "simple_future": [],
    "future_continuous": [],
    "future_perfect": [],
    "future_perfect_continuous": [],
    "subjunctive_mood": [],

    "interrogative_sentences": [],

  },
  "phrases": {
