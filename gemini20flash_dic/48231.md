  "translation": "析构函数 (C++编程)",
  "definition": "In object-oriented programming, a deconstructor (also known as a destructor) is a special member function of a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is destroyed or goes out of scope. Its primary purpose is to release resources acquired by the object during its lifetime, such as memory, file handles, or network connections. In C++, destructors are identified by a tilde (~) prefixing the class name.",
  "example": "The deconstructor is used to free the memory allocated to the object.",

      { "example": "Deconstructors are crucial for managing resources and preventing memory leaks in C++.", "translation": "析构函数对于管理资源和防止C++中的内存泄漏至关重要。" },
      { "example": "Unlike constructors, a class can only have one deconstructor.", "translation": "与构造函数不同，一个类只能有一个析构函数。" },
      { "example": "The deconstructor is invoked automatically when an object is no longer needed.", "translation": "当不再需要对象时，会自动调用析构函数。" }

      { "example": "The deconstructor can be used to close any open files.", "translation": "析构函数可用于关闭任何打开的文件。" },
      { "example": "Make sure to flush the buffer to disk before closing the file in the deconstructor.", "translation": "在析构函数中关闭文件之前，请确保将缓冲区刷新到磁盘。" },
      { "example": "RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) is a technique that relies on deconstructors to automatically release file resources.", "translation": "RAII（资源获取即初始化）是一种依赖于析构函数来自动释放文件资源的技术。" }

      { "example": "The deconstructor will close open network sockets when the object's lifespan is over.", "translation": "当对象的生存期结束时，析构函数将关闭打开的网络套接字" },

      { "example": "If a base class has a virtual deconstructor, derived classes' deconstructors are also called when deleting an object through a base class pointer.", "translation": "如果基类具有虚拟析构函数，则通过基类指针删除对象时，也会调用派生类的析构函数。" },
