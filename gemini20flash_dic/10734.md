  "translation": "翼区（鸟类）",
  "definition": "Areas on a bird's skin that lack feathers, separating the feathered tracts (pterylae). These featherless regions allow for greater flexibility and movement, facilitate heat dissipation, and are important for various behaviors such as preening and incubation.",
  "example": "The apteria are visible when examining the skin of a plucked bird.",

    "featherless tracts",
    "unfeathered skin"
