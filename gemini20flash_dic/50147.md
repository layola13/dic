Please provide the English word(s) you would like me to analyze in the JSON format you've specified. I need the word(s) to proceed. For example, you can provide:

```json
{
"denumbers": "example_word"
}
```

Or, if you have multiple words:

```json
{
"denumbers": "word1, word2, word3"
}
```

Once you provide the word(s), I will create a detailed JSON object containing the word's phonetics, part of speech, translation, definition, example sentences, synonyms, antonyms (if applicable), usage in different tenses, common phrases, and idioms.
