  "phonetics": "/ˌdaɪəˌhiːlɪəˈtrɒpɪzəm/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "倾日性",
  "definition": "The diurnal motion or orientation of plant parts, especially leaves, flowers, and fruits, at right angles to the sun's rays, thereby avoiding excessive exposure to light and heat.",
  "example": "Diaheliotropism can help plants in hot, arid environments reduce water loss by minimizing the surface area exposed to direct sunlight during the hottest part of the day.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [
    "paraheliotropism"
  ],
  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "The phenomenon of diaheliotropism is often observed in plants growing in environments with high solar radiation.",
        "translation": "在具有高太阳辐射的环境中生长的植物通常会观察到倾日性的现象。"
      },
      {
        "example": "Through diaheliotropism, leaves orient themselves to optimize light capture during the early morning and late afternoon when solar intensity is lower.",
        "translation": "通过倾日性，叶子调整方向，以优化在清晨和下午晚些时候太阳强度较低时的光捕获。"
      }
    ],
    "scientific_context": [
      {
        "example": "Studies have shown that diaheliotropism can increase photosynthetic efficiency in certain plant species.",
        "translation": "研究表明，倾日性可以提高某些植物物种的光合作用效率。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The extent of diaheliotropism can vary depending on the plant species, environmental conditions, and developmental stage.",
        "translation": "倾日性的程度可能因植物物种、环境条件和发育阶段而异。"
      }
    ],
    "comparative_examples": [
      {
        "example": "Unlike paraheliotropism, where leaves move to minimize sun exposure, diaheliotropism involves leaves tracking the sun to maximize light interception.",
        "translation": "与叶子移动以尽量减少阳光照射的避日性不同，倾日性包括叶子跟踪太阳以最大化光截获。"
      },
      {
        "example": "While some plants exhibit diaheliotropism, others rely on fixed leaf angles or other mechanisms to regulate light exposure.",
        "translation": "虽然有些植物表现出倾日性，但另一些植物则依靠固定的叶角或其他机制来调节光照。"

      {
        "misconception": "Diaheliotropism only occurs in desert plants.",

        "translation": "虽然在干旱环境中很常见，但在来自各种栖息地的植物中也可以观察到倾日性。"
      },
      {
        "misconception": "Diaheliotropism is the same as heliotropism.",
        "correction": "Diaheliotropism is a specific type of heliotropism where plant parts move to maintain a perpendicular angle to the sun's rays.",
