非常抱歉，您提供的单词 "look's" 并不是一个标准的英语单词。它可能是 "look" 的所有格形式（例如，"the look's meaning"），或者是 "look is" 的缩写形式。为了给您提供最准确的解析，我将分别对这两种可能性进行分析，并以JSON格式返回结果。

**情况 1: "look's" 作为 "look" 的所有格**

```json
{
  "word": "look's (possessive)",
  "part_of_speech": "noun (possessive form)",
  "translation": "……的外观/样子/表情（的所有格）",
  "definition": "The possessive form of 'look,' indicating something belonging to or associated with a particular appearance, expression, or style.",
  "example": "The model's look's impact on the fashion industry was undeniable. / That building's look's architecture is old.",
  "synonyms": ["appearance's", "style's", "expression's"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "example": "The design's look's appeal lies in its simplicity.",
        "translation": "这个设计的外观吸引力在于它的简洁。"
      },
      {
        "example": "The product's look's quality can't be determined just by a single view.",
        "translation": "产品的外观质量不能仅通过一次观察来确定。"
      }
    ]
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [],
    "idioms": []
  }
}
```

**情况 2: "look's" 作为 "look is" 的缩写**

```json
{
  "word": "look's (contraction)",
  "part_of_speech": "verb (contraction of 'look is')",
  "translation": "看起来是",
  "definition": "A contraction of 'look is,' suggesting an appearance or impression.",
  "example": "It look's like it's going to rain. / That look's promising.",
  "synonyms": ["seems", "appears"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "general": [
      {
        "example": "It look's as if they are enjoying the party.",
        "translation": "看起来他们很享受这个聚会。"
      },
      {
        "example": "It look's to me like he's made a mistake.",
        "translation": "在我看来，他好像犯了个错误。"
      }
    ]
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [],
    "idioms": []
  }
}
```

请注意： 在正式写作中，通常建议避免使用 "look's" 作为 "look is" 的缩写，而应使用完整的 "look is"。

希望以上解析能够帮到您！
