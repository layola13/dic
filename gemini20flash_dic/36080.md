  "definition": "A rare order of fish that includes only two extant species in the genus Latimeria: the West Indian Ocean coelacanth (Latimeria chalumnae) and the Indonesian coelacanth (Latimeria menadoensis). They are characterized by their lobed fins, which were once thought to be a transitional form between fish and tetrapods.",
