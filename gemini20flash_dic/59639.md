I've looked for the word "ecderon," and it seems to be a rather uncommon term. It doesn't appear in most standard dictionaries, and it seems to relate specifically to a biological or scientific context, specifically in invertebrate zoology. Therefore, the JSON format will be more limited than the example you provided for "what."
