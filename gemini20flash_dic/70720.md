  "definition": "Unfortunately, 'finbat' is not a standard English word. It's possible it's a made-up word, a typo, a proper noun, or a word from a specific jargon or dialect.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard definition, part of speech, synonyms, antonyms, or example usage. I can only offer possibilities, based on its construction (fin + bat). Possible, VERY speculative, interpretations might be a type of bat with pronounced fin-like structures on its body, or a 'fin' affixed to a bat in baseball, or, depending on context, something completely different.",
