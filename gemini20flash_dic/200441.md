  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "context": "In metallurgy, slagability refers to the ability of certain components in the ore or charge to combine with fluxing agents to form slag, which can then be easily separated from the molten metal.",
        "example": "Good slagability is essential for the removal of impurities during steelmaking."
