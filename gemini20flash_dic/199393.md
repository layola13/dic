  "definition": "In mathematics, a simplex is a generalization of the notion of a triangle or tetrahedron to arbitrary dimensions. It is a convex polytope that is defined by *n* + 1 vertices in *n*-dimensional space. For example, a 0-simplex is a point, a 1-simplex is a line segment, a 2-simplex is a triangle, and a 3-simplex is a tetrahedron. 'Simplexes' is the plural form.",
  "example": "The algorithm decomposes the complex shape into a set of simplexes for easier processing.",
