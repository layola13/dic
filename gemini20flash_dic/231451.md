I was unable to find a direct dictionary entry for the word "underrulers." It's possible this is a compound word or a less common term. However, I can provide a breakdown based on its potential components and morphology:

It appears "underrulers" is formed by combining the prefix "under-" with the noun "rulers."

*   **Under-**: This prefix generally means "beneath," "below," "lower in rank," or "secondary."
*   **Rulers**: This refers to individuals who govern or control, such as monarchs, leaders, or those in authority.

With this in mind, here's a potential interpretation and JSON format:
