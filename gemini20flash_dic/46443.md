I was unable to find an exact match for the word "dagswain" in the resources I consulted. It is possible that this is a very rare word, a technical term, a proper noun, or perhaps a word from a language other than English. It could also be a misspelling.

I can, however, still attempt to provide a response in the JSON format you requested, but please keep in mind that the information will be based on educated guesses and general linguistic principles rather than verified data.
