  "definition": "An air-breathing jet engine consisting of a gas turbine with a propelling nozzle. The gas turbine is used to drive an air compressor which draws air in through an intake duct at the front of the engine, compresses it, and forces it into a combustion chamber where it is mixed with fuel and ignited. The hot exhaust gases pass through the turbine, which extracts power to drive the compressor, and then exit through the nozzle to provide thrust.",
  "example": "The turbojet engine was a major advancement in aviation technology.",
