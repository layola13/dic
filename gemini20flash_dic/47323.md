I'll do my best to create a detailed JSON format breakdown for the word "de-pested," but please note that "de-pested" isn't a standard English word. It appears to be a compound word formed with the prefix "de-" and the word "pested" (or "pest"). I will provide a breakdown based on this understanding, focusing on how it might be used and interpreted.
