  "translation": "钍（thorium）的复数形式",
  "definition": "Plural form of thorium. Thorium is a weakly radioactive metallic chemical element with symbol Th and atomic number 90. Thorium is silvery-white and tarnishes black when it is exposed to air, forming thorium dioxide; it is moderately hard, malleable, and has a high melting point. Thorium is an electropositive actinide whose chemistry is dominated by the +4 oxidation state; it is quite reactive and can ignite in air when finely divided.",
  "example": "The laboratory analyzed several samples containing thoriums to determine their isotopic composition.",
