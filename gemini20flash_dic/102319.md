  "etymology": {
    "origin": "The term 'ivory tower' comes from the French 'tour d'ivoire,' which was used in the 19th century to describe the state of poets who were detached from everyday life. The expression can be traced back to the Song of Songs (7:4) in the Old Testament, where the neck of the beloved is compared to a tower of ivory, symbolizing purity and inaccessibility.",
    "historical_context": "Historically, ivory was a precious and rare material, symbolizing wealth and status. Towers, in general, represent isolation and protection. Combining these concepts creates the image of a place of privileged isolation, where intellectuals or artists can pursue their work without the distractions and compromises of the everyday world."
