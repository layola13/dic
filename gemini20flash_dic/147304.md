  "translation": "过调制",
  "definition": "A condition in amplitude modulation where the modulating signal exceeds the carrier signal's amplitude, causing distortion and signal breakup.",

    "general_usage": [
      {
        "sentence": "The transmitter was experiencing overmodulation, leading to poor audio quality.",

      {
        "sentence": "To avoid overmodulation, the audio input level must be carefully controlled.",

    "technical_context": [
      {
        "sentence": "Overmodulation results in the carrier signal being completely suppressed during portions of the modulation cycle.",

      {
        "sentence": "In AM broadcasting, overmodulation is illegal as it causes interference to adjacent channels.",

      {
        "sentence": "If you hear distortion in your AM radio, check for overmodulation at the transmitter.",
