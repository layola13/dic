  "definition": "In insects, the episternum is a sclerite (hardened plate) found on the lateral (side) region of the insect's thorax, specifically the anterior (front) part of the pleuron (the side plate of each segment of the thorax). It lies in front of the epimeron and below the pleural wing process.",
