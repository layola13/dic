**Important Notes:**

*   **Placeholder Information:**  Since "davyum" seems to be a made-up word, I've used placeholder information and example sentences.  You **MUST** replace these with accurate details if "davyum" has a real meaning or you are using it in a specific context.
*   **Phonetics:** I've provided a *possible* phonetic transcription. You'll need to verify this.
*   **Part of Speech:** I've defaulted to "noun," but this could change depending on how "davyum" is used.
*   **Translation:** The translations are based on the assumption that "davyum" is a thing or element. Adjust accordingly.
*   **Usage Examples:**  I've tried to create a variety of usage examples across different tenses and sentence structures, mirroring your "what" example.  These are, however, generic and should be tailored to the actual meaning of "davyum."
*   **Idioms/Phrases:** These are speculative and need to be replaced with real-world usage.

This JSON structure provides a framework. You need to fill in the accurate details about "davyum" for it to be useful. If you can provide more context about the word, I might be able to give you a more precise response.
