  "notes": "The word 'unassertivenesses' is the plural form of 'unassertiveness.' While dictionaries typically provide phonetic transcriptions for singular forms, the transcription for the plural can be derived from the singular. However, due to the rarity of needing the plural form pronounced, a specific phonetic transcription is not widely available. The pronunciation would follow the rules of English pronunciation for pluralizing nouns."
