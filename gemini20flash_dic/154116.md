  "translation": "后成论；渐成论",
  "definition": "The theory that development proceeds through a series of new creations, in contrast to preformationism. Specifically, in biology, it refers to the obsolete concept that an organism arises de novo rather than developing from pre-existing elements. In geology, it refers to the complete or partial removal of material from the upper part of a rock mass or a deposit, leading to the formation of new shapes or features on the surface.",
  "example": "The theory of perigenesis was proposed to explain the development of organisms, suggesting that new structures arise during development rather than being preformed.",
  "synonyms": [
    "epigenesis",
    "neoformation"
  ],
  "antonyms": [
    "preformationism"

  "usage": {
    "general_usage": [
      {
        "example": "In the history of embryology, perigenesis represents an early attempt to explain how complex structures arise during development.",

      },
      {
        "example": "The concept of perigenesis has been replaced by more modern understandings of genetics and molecular biology.",

      {
        "example": "Perigenesis in geology can lead to the formation of unique landforms through the erosion and removal of surface materials.",

      },
      {
        "example": "The study of perigenesis helps geologists understand the processes that shape the Earth's surface over time.",

      {

      },
      {
        "example": "Although perigenesis is no longer accepted as a primary mechanism, it played a role in the development of modern embryological theory.",
