Please provide the word you would like me to analyze in the JSON format you specified. I need the actual word to proceed. For example, you would replace "{encrypted}" with the English word you want me to analyze, like this:

```json
{
  "word": "example"
}
```

Once you provide the word, I will create a JSON object containing the word's phonetics, part of speech, translation, definition, example sentences, synonyms, antonyms, usage in different tenses, and common phrases.
