  "definition": "Plural form of prevoid; these are microscopic voids or empty spaces that form in a material, particularly metals, before the onset of macroscopic damage or fracture. They are often associated with the accumulation of plastic deformation and can serve as nucleation sites for larger voids that eventually lead to failure. Typically studied within materials science and engineering fields.",
  "example": "The study of prevoids is crucial in understanding the fatigue failure mechanism of metallic alloys.",
