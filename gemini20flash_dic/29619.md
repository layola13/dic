**Explanation:**

*   **word**: The English word itself (e.g., "example").
*   **phonetics**: The phonetic transcription of the word (e.g., "/ɪɡˈzæmpl/").
*   **part\_of\_speech**:  The grammatical category of the word (e.g., "noun, verb").
*   **translation**:  A simple Chinese translation of the word (e.g., "例子").

*   **example**: A basic example sentence using the word.
*   **synonyms**:  A list of synonyms for the word.
*   **antonyms**:  A list of antonyms for the word (if applicable).
*   **usage**: This section provides example sentences in various tenses and grammatical structures to illustrate how the word is used. Each tense includes two example sentences:
    *   **simple\_present**, **present\_continuous**, **present\_perfect**, **present\_perfect\_continuous**, **simple\_past**, **past\_continuous**, **past\_perfect**, **past\_perfect\_continuous**, **simple\_future**, **future\_continuous**, **future\_perfect**, **future\_perfect\_continuous**: Each tense includes two example sentences with their Chinese translations.
    *   **subjunctive\_mood**: Example sentences showing the use of the word in the subjunctive mood.
    *   **passive\_voice**: Example sentences demonstrating the word in passive voice constructions.
    *   **interrogative\_sentences**: Example sentences in question form.
    *   **negative\_sentences**: Example sentences using negative constructions.
*   **phrases**:

    *   **idioms**:  Idiomatic expressions that include the word, along with their meanings.

To use this template, you would replace the bracketed placeholders (e.g., "{category}", "/{phonetics}/", "{definition}") with the actual data for the English word you want to analyze.
