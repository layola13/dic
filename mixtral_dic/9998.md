Since "aphrodites" is a noun and typically refers to multiple instances of the Greek goddess Aphrodite, its usage is primarily descriptive and does not fit into the various tense structures like verbs or other parts of speech. Therefore, the usage section is empty for most tenses. The translation and examples are focused on its role as a plural noun.
