### Explanation:
The word "bigging" does not exist as a standard English word. It does not have an accepted definition, phonetic transcription, part of speech, translation, example sentences, synonyms, antonyms, or standard usage in different tenses and contexts. Therefore, the fields for these categories are either left empty or marked as "not applicable."

If "bigging" is a misspelling or a term from a specific context (such as slang or a specific dialect), more context would be needed to provide a more accurate analysis.
