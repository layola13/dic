### Context and Usage
The term "suffruticose" is often used in botanical contexts to describe certain plant forms that exhibit a growth pattern between herbaceous plants and true shrubs. These plants may have some woody characteristics but are generally low-growing, making them essential in ecological studies focusing on plant habitats. 

For example, suffruticose plants form a significant part of the understory in scrublands or similar habitats and play a crucial role in the ecosystem by providing shelter and food for various animals.
