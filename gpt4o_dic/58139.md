### Additional Context:

**Drosophila** (singular form) refers to a genus of insects that are often used as model organisms in scientific research, particularly in genetics, developmental biology, and agriculture. The most well-known species is **Drosophila melanogaster**, which has been instrumental in numerous scientific discoveries, including the understanding of the inheritance of traits. Drosophilae are characterized by their small size, rapid life cycle, and ease of genetic manipulation, making them ideal for laboratory studies.
