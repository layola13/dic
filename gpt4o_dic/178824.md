It seems you are asking for a detailed analysis similar to the example format provided but for the word "recurvous." However, "recurvous" does not appear to be a recognized English word based on my training data up until October 2023. 

If you meant a different word or if it is a specific term from a niche area, please provide additional context or clarify, and I'll be happy to assist you further!
