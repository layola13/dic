  "word": "prochirality",
  "phonetics": "/proʊˈkaɪr.ə.lɪ.ti/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "前手性",
  "definition": "Prochirality refers to a property of a molecule where it can be transformed into a chiral molecule by the substitution of any one of its identical substituents. This distinction allows for certain compounds to have a potential to exist as two enantiomers based on their substitution patterns.",
  "example": "In a prochiral molecule, the addition of a group can create two distinct chiral forms.",
  "synonyms": ["pseudo-chirality", "achiral"],
  "antonyms": ["chirality"],
  "usage": {
    "contextual_example": "Prochiral centers are important in organic synthesis, enabling chemists to generate chiral molecules efficiently."
  },
  "related_terms": {
    "chirality": {
      "definition": "The property of a molecule having non-superimposable mirror images, typically referring to chiral molecules.",
      "example": "Lactic acid exists in two chiral forms, which can have vastly different biological activities."
    },
    "chiral": {
      "definition": "Describes molecules that have chirality, meaning they can exist in two non-superimposable forms.",
      "example": "Chiral drugs may have different effects based on their specific enantiomer."
    }
  },
  "importance": "Understanding prochirality is crucial in fields like pharmaceuticals, where the synthesis of specific enantiomers can influence the efficacy and safety of drugs."
