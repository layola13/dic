### Additional Context
"Maggiore" is often used in musical terminology, particularly in classical music, to denote pieces that are written in a major key, which usually conveys a brighter and more uplifting mood compared to minor keys. This usage can also extend to descriptions of size or importance in other contexts in Italian.
