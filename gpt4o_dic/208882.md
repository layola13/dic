### Additional Context
Struvite is often associated with medical conditions related to the urinary system, particularly urinary tract infections caused by urease-producing bacteria, which can lead to the formation of these crystals. These stones can cause pain and complications and may require specific treatments to remove them. Additionally, struvite can also relate to environmental science, as it is explored for its potential in nutrient recovery from wastewater, contributing to sustainable practices in agriculture.
