### Context and Explanation

**Self-assembly** is a crucial concept in various scientific fields, including chemistry, materials science, and biology. It refers to the ability of certain molecules or systems to spontaneously organize into predetermined structures without external intervention. For instance, lipids can self-assemble into bilayers to form cell membranes, and nanomaterials often utilize self-assembly techniques to fabricate complex structures.

This property has significant implications in the development of new materials, drug delivery systems, and even in understanding biological processes. Researchers are continuously exploring applications of self-assembly in various technologies, making it a topic of ongoing interest and innovation.
