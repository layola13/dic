The word you provided, "unflightiest," isn't a standard English word.  It appears to be a playful or invented word, likely formed by adding the prefix "un-" (meaning "not") and the superlative suffix "-est" (indicating the highest degree) to a word related to "flight."  However, there is no established word "flightiest" from which to derive "unflightiest."

To understand the intended meaning, we need context.  Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the sentence or situation in which it was used would help determine its probable meaning.  For example, it might be intended to mean:

* **Not capable of the highest degree of flight:** This is the most literal interpretation, implying something lacking the ability to fly exceptionally well or at all.
* **Not the most flighty or capricious:** If "flighty" is used in its informal sense of being erratic or capricious, "unflightiest" could mean the most steady, dependable, or grounded.

Without further information, it's impossible to give a precise definition.  Provide more context, and I can offer a more accurate analysis.
