### Contextual Explanation
The term "neuro-effector" is often used in fields such as neuroscience, biomedical engineering, and neurology to describe devices or mechanisms that mediate the effects of neural activity. These can include both artificial devices (like neuroprosthetics) and natural biological components (like neurotransmitters) that trigger responses in the body, particularly in relation to muscle movement and other physiological functions.
