### Context and Usage:
- **Lambdas** are significant in programming languages such as Python, Java, and JavaScript, where they help write cleaner and more functional code.
- The term **"lambda"** originates from the mathematical concept of lambda calculus, which is a formal system for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application.
- They are often used in functional programming to pass small functions as arguments, significantly enhancing code readability and efficiency.
