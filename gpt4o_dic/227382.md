### Context
The prefix "un-" negates the adjective "platonic," which originates from Plato's idea of love that is purely intellectual and devoid of physical attraction. In modern usage, "un-platonic" signifies a shift towards romantic or sexual involvement, contrasting with platonic friendships where such attractions do not exist.
