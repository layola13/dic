  "definition": "A multigraph is a type of graph in graph theory that is allowed to have multiple edges (arcs) between the same pair of vertices. It can represent complex relationships by allowing more than one connection between nodes.",
  "example": "In a multigraph representing the road network, multiple roads connecting the same cities can be represented by multiple edges.",
  "synonyms": ["multilayer graph", "multi-edge graph"],
  "antonyms": ["simple graph"],
  "usage": {
    "in_mathematics": [
      { "sentence": "In graph theory, a multigraph can help model transportation systems where multiple routes exist between locations.", "translation": "在图论中，多重图可以帮助模拟存在多条路线的交通系统。" },
      { "sentence": "When analyzing a multigraph, you need to consider the weights of each edge.", "translation": "在分析多重图时，您需要考虑每条边的权重。" }
