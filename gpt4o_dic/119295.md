  "word": "micro-evolutionary",
  "phonetics": "/ˌmaɪkroʊˌɛvəˈluːʃənəri/",
  "part_of_speech": "adj.",
  "translation": "微进化的",
  "definition": "Relating to small evolutionary changes that occur within a species or population over a short period.",
  "example": "Micro-evolutionary processes can lead to adaptations in response to environmental changes.",
  "synonyms": ["adaptive evolution", "evolutionary change"],
  "antonyms": ["macro-evolutionary"],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [
      { "sentence": "Micro-evolutionary changes often go unnoticed.", "translation": "微进化的变化通常不被察觉。" }
    ],
    "present_continuous": [
      { "sentence": "Organisms are undergoing micro-evolutionary adaptations.", "translation": "生物正在经历微进化适应。" }
    ],
    "simple_past": [
      { "sentence": "The species exhibited micro-evolutionary traits over the years.", "translation": "该物种在多年中表现出微进化特征。" }

  },
  "context": {
    "explanation": "Micro-evolution refers to the minor evolutionary changes that occur within a population, often driven by natural selection, genetic drift, or gene flow. These changes can lead to variations in traits, enhancing survival and reproductive success in a given environment.",
    "applications": "Understanding micro-evolutionary processes is crucial in fields like conservation biology, agriculture, and medicine, especially regarding how species adapt to changing environments or resist diseases."
  },
  "related_terms": [
    { "term": "natural selection", "definition": "The process whereby organisms better adapted to their environment tend to survive and produce more offspring." },
    { "term": "genetic drift", "definition": "Random changes in the frequency of alleles in a population, which can lead to significant micro-evolutionary changes." }
  ]
