### Context and Usage

The term "nonclassicalities" is often used in academic contexts, particularly in fields like physics, mathematics, and philosophy, to describe phenomena or concepts that do not conform to classical theories. For example, in quantum mechanics, nonclassicalities refer to behaviors and properties that cannot be explained using classical physics. The usage of the term captures the essence of seeking or acknowledging alternative perspectives or models that challenge established norms.
