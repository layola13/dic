### Additional Context:
- **Usage in Diving**: Trimix is particularly beneficial for deep-sea divers as it mitigates nitrogen narcosis and allows for longer decompression times.
- **Safety Considerations**: It’s crucial for divers to understand the oxygen partial pressures involved with trimix to prevent oxygen toxicity.
