### Context:

O-levels were historically significant in the UK education system, providing a standardized qualification for secondary school students. They have been largely replaced by GCSEs since the late 20th century, but the term is still used in some contexts. They typically assess a range of subjects and serve as a foundation for higher academic pursuits.
