### Additional Context:
- **Origin**: The term combines the prefix "un-" (indicating negation) with "spited," which comes from "spite," denoting ill will or malice.
- **Usage**: The word is not commonly used in everyday conversation but may appear in more formal or literary contexts to describe a lack of malice or revenge in interpersonal relations.
