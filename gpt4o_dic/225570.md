### Context
The term "truthy" gained popularity in the 2000s, notably through comedian Stephen Colbert, who used it in discussions about the perceived truth of statements in politics and media, regardless of their factual basis. It highlights how something can "feel" true to someone even if it isn’t substantiated by evidence.
