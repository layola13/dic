### Context:
"Synthy" is commonly used in modern music discussions, especially when referencing genres like synth-pop, electronic, or ambient music. This term evokes a specific auditory aesthetic associated with synthesizers, reflecting a departure from natural sounds to highly produced, often layered electronic tones. The popularity of this sound has surged in recent years, particularly with the revival of 80s styles in contemporary music.
