  "translation": "外渗透",
  "definition": "The movement of solvent molecules out of a cell or organism through a semipermeable membrane, resulting in a decrease of water content within the cell.",
  "example": "During exosmosis, water moves from inside the cell to the external environment, causing the cell to shrink.",

  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [
      { "sentence": "Exosmosis occurs when the concentration of solutes is higher outside the cell.", "translation": "当细胞外的溶质浓度更高时，会发生外渗透。" }
    ],
    "present_continuous": [
      { "sentence": "The cell is undergoing exosmosis as the surrounding solution is more concentrated.", "translation": "当周围的溶液浓度更高时，细胞正在经历外渗透。" }
    ],
    "simple_past": [
      { "sentence": "Yesterday, we observed exosmosis happening in the plant cells.", "translation": "昨天，我们观察到植物细胞中发生了外渗透。" }
    ],
    "future_simple": [
      { "sentence": "If the environment remains hypertonic, exosmosis will continue.", "translation": "如果环境保持高渗透状态，外渗透将继续。" }
