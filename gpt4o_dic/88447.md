### Additional Information

**Role in Allergic Reactions**: Histamine is primarily known for its role in allergic reactions where it is released by mast cells and basophils in response to allergens. This release causes inflammation, which leads to common allergy symptoms.

**Histamine and Gut Function**: Beyond allergies, histamine also regulates functions in the gut, influencing gastric acid secretion and intestinal motility.

**Antihistamines**: Medications that inhibit histamine's effects are widely used to treat allergies, hay fever, and certain other conditions, illustrating the practical importance of histamine in both health and medicine.
