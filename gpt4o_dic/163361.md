It seems that "preconizate" is not a standard English word and may not have a widely recognized definition or usage. However, if this term is meant to derive from "preconization," which refers to a process of prior recommendation or endorsement (often in decision-making contexts), I can provide details based on that. Here’s an interpretation in a similar format:

```json

    ],

    ],
    "future_simple": [

    ]
  },
  "phrases": {

      { "phrase": "to preconizate the findings", "translation": "预先推荐调查结果" }

}
```
