### Additional Context
- **Usage in Context**: "Responsiblest" is relatively uncommon in everyday English. The equivalent phrase "most responsible" is typically preferred. However, in certain contexts, especially informal settings or specific discussions about character traits, you might encounter "responsiblest."
- **Grammar Note**: In English, superlatives are often formed with "most" rather than by modifying the adjective itself when the word has more than two syllables, which applies here with "responsible."
