### Additional Context:
- **Non-vascular plants** include groups such as mosses, liverworts, and hornworts. They generally are simpler in structure compared to vascular plants, relying on their environment for water and nutrients without a complex system of tubes.
- Understanding non-vascular plants can provide insights into plant evolution and ecology, as they are some of the earliest land plants, thriving in moist environments.
