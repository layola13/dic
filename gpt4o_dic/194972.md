  "translation": "半环",
  "definition": "A semi-ring is a mathematical structure that resembles a ring but does not necessarily include a multiplicative identity. It consists of a non-empty set equipped with two binary operations, typically addition and multiplication, where the addition forms an abelian group and multiplication is associative and distributes over addition.",
  "example": "The set of non-negative integers forms a semi-ring under the usual addition and multiplication.",
  "synonyms": ["semigroup", "ring without unity"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [
      { "example": "A semi-ring defines its operations differently from a ring.", "translation": "半环与环的运算定义不同。" },
