### Context

In-leaf is primarily used in botanical contexts to indicate that a plant has entered its growing season and is adorned with leaves, contributing to vegetation and aesthetics in the environment. The term contrasts with "leafless," typically referring to trees or plants that have shed their leaves during dormancy or adverse conditions.
