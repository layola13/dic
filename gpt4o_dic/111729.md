### Contextual Explanation
"Locular" is often used in biological and botanical contexts to describe structures that contain or are divided into compartments. For instance, in botany, many fruits (like tomatoes) have locular structures to facilitate the development and dispersal of seeds. Understanding this term can enhance comprehension in subjects relating to biology, anatomy, and certain fields of medicine.
