### Additional Context
Homogentisic acid is significant in biochemistry and is commonly studied in connection with genetic conditions such as alkaptonuria. This condition leads to the body's inability to fully break down certain amino acids, resulting in the accumulation of homogentisic acid, which can cause joint and tissue damage over time.
