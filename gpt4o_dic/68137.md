### Context and Additional Information:
The Fahrenheit scale was proposed by Gabriel Fahrenheit in the early 18th century and is prevalent mainly in the United States and some Caribbean nations for everyday temperature measurements. The scale is defined by two fixed points: 0°F, the temperature of a freezing brine solution, and 32°F, the freezing point of water. This scale is often contrasted with the Celsius scale, which is widely used in most other parts of the world.
