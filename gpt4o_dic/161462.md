### Context and Additional Information

**Potamospongiae** is a lesser-known classification within the biological taxonomy of sponges, specifically adapted for freshwater environments. They are important in understanding freshwater ecosystems because they can serve as bioindicators of water quality and habitat health.

Their ecological roles typically include filtering water and providing habitats for various microorganisms. Researching potamospongiae can contribute to environmental conservation efforts, particularly in freshwater ecosystems threatened by pollution and habitat loss.
