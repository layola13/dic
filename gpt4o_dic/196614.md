I cannot find a word "setness" in standard English dictionaries or corpora.  It's possible that:

* **It's a neologism:** A newly coined word not yet widely adopted.
* **It's a technical term:** Specific to a particular field (e.g., a niche area of mathematics or engineering).
* **It's a misspelling:**  A slight variation of an existing word.
* **It's a proper noun:** A name or place name.

To help me find the information you're looking for, could you please provide more context?  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (e.g., a book, article, conversation)
* **What was the sentence or paragraph in which it appeared?**  This will give me clues about its meaning and usage.
* **What is the subject matter?**  Knowing the topic will help narrow down the possibilities.


With more information, I can attempt to locate a definition and provide an analysis similar to the example you gave for the word "what".
