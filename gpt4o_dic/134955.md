### Overview
Nonnarratives encompass forms of creative expression that do not adhere to traditional storytelling structures involving plot and character development. This term is often used in discussions of art, literature, and film to describe works that focus on themes, emotions, or concepts without following a linear narrative. Examples include abstract art or experimental films that convey meaning through imagery and visual symbols rather than a structured plot.
