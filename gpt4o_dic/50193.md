The key points about the word "deoxy" are:

1. It is an adjective meaning "relating to or denoting compounds in which oxygen has been removed, especially deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)".

2. It is commonly used in the context of DNA, where "deoxy" refers to the deoxyribose sugar that forms the backbone of the DNA molecule.

3. It can also be used to describe other deoxygenated compounds, such as deoxy-hemoglobin.

4. The word has a Greek root "deoxy-" meaning "without oxygen".

5. It is used in various tenses and grammatical constructions, as shown in the example sentences.

6. There are no commonly used idiomatic phrases containing "deoxy", as it is a relatively technical scientific term.
