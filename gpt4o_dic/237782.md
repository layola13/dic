### Commentary
- **Unquerulousnesses** stems from the root "querulous," which refers to someone who is inclined to complain; thus, the un- prefix implies a negation of such behavior.
- The plural form emphasizes multiple instances or expressions of this quality, often useful in discussions of character traits, particularly in contexts of resilience or positivity. 
- While it's a rare and formal term, it can be used effectively in literature or discussions about personal attitudes.
