Please note that "pilateses" is not a common term in standard English usage. Typically, "Pilates" can refer to the exercise system in both singular and plural contexts (like "Pilates classes"). However, I've presented this analysis assuming the term is used to refer to multiple sessions or classes of Pilates.
