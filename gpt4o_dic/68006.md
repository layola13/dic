### Additional Context
Factive verbs, such as "know," "realize," and "regret," imply that the information conveyed in their clauses is true and accepted as fact. This contrasts with non-factive verbs, which do not carry this implication. Understanding the distinction between factive and non-factive language helps clarify meaning in both spoken and written contexts.
