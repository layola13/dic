I am sorry, but I cannot find any information about the word "tangalung" in my database.  There is no established English word with that spelling.  Could you please double-check the spelling or provide more context, such as the language of origin or a sentence where you encountered this word?  This additional information would greatly assist me in finding the definition and providing a detailed analysis similar to the example you provided for "what".
