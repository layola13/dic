### Additional Context
- **Etymology**: The prefix "un-" indicates negation, while "hoary" comes from Old English "har," meaning gray or white, often associated with age. Therefore, "unhoary" literally means "not gray-haired."
- **Usage**: While it's a less common term, "unhoary" can be fitting in literary contexts or descriptions focused on youthfulness and vitality.
