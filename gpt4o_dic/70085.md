### Context and Use
"Feuillemort" is derived from French, meaning "dead leaf." The term is commonly used in art and design to describe muted, earth-toned colors that evoke the feeling of nature's decay, often used to create a nostalgic or melancholic ambiance. This color can serve as both a neutral backdrop and an accent in various artistic and decorative contexts.
