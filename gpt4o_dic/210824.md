### Context

"Subsatiricalnesses" refers to a specific quality or nuance within writing or art that employs a lighter, less intense form of satire. This term is used to describe works that maintain comedic elements without crossing into harsh or biting criticism typical of full satire. The word is crafted from "sub," meaning lesser or below, and "satirical," which refers to the use of humor, irony, or exaggeration to criticize or mock. 

In usage, it might refer to the subtle, often playful manner in which an author addresses social issues, allowing for engagement and humor while avoiding offense.
