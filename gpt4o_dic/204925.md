### Additional Context:
- **Use in Fields**: Splines are widely used in computer graphics, animation, and engineering design to create complex curves and surfaces smoothly. 
- **Types**: Different types of splines include B-splines, cubic splines, and nonlinear splines, each with specific applications and properties.
- **Mathematical Relevance**: In mathematics, splines play a crucial role in numerical analysis and approximation theory, providing ways to interpolate between data points effectively.
