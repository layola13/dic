It seems there may be a misunderstanding as "triobolary" doesn't appear to be a recognized English word. If you meant "trilobite," "vocabulary," or something else, please clarify so I can assist you better. If you meant a term related to English vocabulary or a linguistic concept, I'm happy to help with that as well!
