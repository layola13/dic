### Context and Usage
- **Semicatalysts** are often discussed in the field of chemistry and materials science, where they play a crucial role in enhancing the speed of reactions without complete consumption. Their characteristics lie between traditional catalysts and non-catalytic substances, which makes them valuable in certain applications, particularly in environmental technologies and industrial processes.

- In practical contexts, semicatalysts might be employed to lower energy requirements in processes, contributing to more efficient and sustainable chemical production.
