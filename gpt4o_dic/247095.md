I cannot find information about the word "wazoos" in standard English dictionaries or corpora.  It's possible this is:

* **A slang term or neologism:**  Words and phrases are constantly being created. Without more context (where you encountered this word, who used it), it's difficult to define it.
* **A misspelling:** Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **Specific to a particular community or subculture:**  Some words have very niche usage.

To help me find a definition, please provide more information about where you encountered the word "wazoos."
