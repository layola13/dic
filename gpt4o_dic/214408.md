### Additional Information:
- **Contextual Use**: Supply-side economics gained prominence in the 1980s, particularly under President Ronald Reagan, where it was believed that reducing taxes on businesses and individuals would lead to greater investment and economic expansion.
- **Critique**: While proponents claim that it encourages job creation and economic growth, opponents argue that it can lead to income inequality and may not effectively address demand-side issues.
