### Additional Information

**Context**: Ornithosauria is a clade often referred to in paleontology when discussing the evolution and characteristics of flying reptiles distinct from birds but sharing some similarities. Members of this group, such as Pteranodon and Quetzalcoatlus, exhibit features like hollow bones and large wingspans that allowed them to soar through prehistoric skies.

**Significance**: Studying ornithosaurs helps scientists understand the diversity of flight mechanisms among reptiles and their evolutionary adaptations.
