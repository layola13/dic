**Contextual Notes**:
- **Usage in Mathematics and Science**: In fields like mathematics, physics, or programming, nonvariables are essential as they provide fixed references or constants that allow for more predictable outcomes in equations or systems.
- **Importance in Programming**: In computer science, nonvariables often refer to constants within the code that should not change during execution. This immutability can enhance debugging and maintainable code practices.
