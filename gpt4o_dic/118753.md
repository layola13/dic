### Additional Context

The term "metalinguistically" is often used in the fields of linguistics, education, and philosophy. It refers to approaches that reflect on language itself, discussing its structures, uses, and implications rather than just the content it conveys. Metalinguistic awareness is crucial for language learning and comprehension, as it helps individuals understand not just what is said, but how language functions and varies in different contexts.
