### Context and Explanation
Self-impregnators refer to entities that are capable of self-fertilization, meaning they can reproduce without the need for a mate. This concept is common in certain plant species and some organisms, allowing them to thrive in environments where mates are scarce. The term combines "self-" (indicating it operates independently) and "impregnators" (suggesting the act of fertilization or reproduction). Though beneficial in many cases, self-impregnation can also have ecological impacts, affecting genetic diversity within populations.
