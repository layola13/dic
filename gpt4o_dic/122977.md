### Additional Context

**Philosophical Background**:
Monadism is predominantly linked to Leibniz, who proposed that reality consists of indivisible units (monads) that reflect the universe from their own perspective. Each monad is unique and preordained to interact harmoniously with others without physical interaction, underscoring a metaphysical framework that challenges materialist perspectives.

**Cultural Relevance**:
In contemporary discussions, the principles of monadism can be applied to various fields including physics, theology, and systems theory, where the nature of individual components and their relations within a cohesive system are crucial.
