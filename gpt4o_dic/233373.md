### Notes:
- **Etymology**: The prefix "un-" negates the base word "fleeting," which comes from "fleet," meaning to pass quickly.
- **Context of Use**: Often used in literary or philosophical contexts to describe aspects of life, nature, or emotions that persist over time, contrasting with transient experiences.
