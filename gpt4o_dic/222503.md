I cannot find the word "torvity" in any standard English dictionaries or word lists.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a very rare or obsolete word, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specialized field.

To help me find the information you need, could you please provide more context? For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (A book, article, conversation, etc.)  Knowing the source might help identify its meaning or origin.
* **What is the surrounding sentence or paragraph?** The context will help me understand its intended meaning.
* **What do you think the word might mean?** Your guess, even if incorrect, can guide the search.


With more information, I will be better equipped to assist you.
