### Additional Context

**Etymology**: The term "proglottis" originates from the Greek words "pro-" meaning "before" and "glottis", referring to the mouth or opening, reflecting its role in the organism's anatomy.

**Biological Role**: Proglottids are critical for the reproduction of tapeworms. Each segment can produce eggs and is passed from the host’s body, allowing for outside reproduction and the possibility of infecting new hosts.
