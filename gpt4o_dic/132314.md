### Context and Additional Details

A **nondefiner** typically includes words like "some," "any," "many," and "few." These terms provide information without specifying the exact nature or quantity of the noun they modify. This concept is important in linguistics, particularly in discussions surrounding specificity and definiteness in language structure. Understanding the differences between definer and nondefiner usage can significantly enhance both comprehension and production of nuanced language.
