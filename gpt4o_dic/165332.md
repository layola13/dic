### Contextual Notes:
- **Preinvitation** is often used in social planning contexts, such as weddings, parties, or other events, where the host may want to informally check attendees' availability before formally inviting them.
- This term combines the prefix "pre-" meaning "before" with "invitation," indicating an invitation that occurs prior to the main event.
