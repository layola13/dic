### 解析说明

**Transitive vs. Intransitive Verbs**
- **Transitive Verbs**: Require a direct object (e.g., "She reads a book.").
- **Intransitive Verbs**: Do not require a direct object (e.g., "He sleeps.").

### Contextual Examples
1. Verbs with high transitiveness may allow for complex sentence structures. For instance, "The chef cooked dinner" demonstrates clear transitivity since "dinner" is the direct object.
2. The study of transitivenesses enables a deeper understanding of syntax and sentence construction in various languages.

### 重要性
Understanding the transitiveness of verbs is critical for mastering grammar and achieving fluency in a language, affecting how sentences are formed and understood.
