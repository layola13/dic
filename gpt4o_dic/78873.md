### Additional Context
The term "ginglymodi" is derived from the Greek word "ginglymos," meaning hinge. Ginglymodi joints are especially important in the human body, found in places such as the elbow and knee, facilitating movements like flexion and extension. This classification of joints is crucial in biology and anatomy for understanding human movement.
