  "phonetics": "/ˌhaɪpərˌpɔːlərɪˈzeɪʃən/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "超极化",
  "definition": "A process in which the interior of a cell becomes more negatively charged compared to the exterior, usually due to an influx of chloride ions or an efflux of potassium ions, making it less likely to fire an action potential.",
  "example": "After neurotransmitter release, the neuron experienced hyperpolarization, reducing the likelihood of an action potential.",
  "synonyms": ["depolarization decrease", "inhibition"],
  "antonyms": ["depolarization"],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [
      { "sentence": "Hyperpolarization occurs following the inhibition of neurotransmitter release.", "translation": "超极化发生在神经递质释放抑制后。" }
    ],
    "present_continuous": [
      { "sentence": "The neuron is undergoing hyperpolarization in response to the stimulus.", "translation": "神经元正在对刺激发生超极化。" }

      { "sentence": "The cell hyperpolarized after the ion channels opened.", "translation": "离子通道打开后，细胞发生了超极化。" }
