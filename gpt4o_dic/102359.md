### Explanation:

- **Meaning**: The suffix "-ized" generally indicates the completion of an action or a change in state, forming a past participle from the base verb.
- **Usage in Different Tenses**: 
  - In the present tense, verbs can take forms such as "organize" and use "-ized" for past tense (e.g., "organized").
  - It is also used to describe processes (e.g., "modernizing").
- **Common Examples**: Words like "recognized," "analyzed," and "realized" show how this suffix alters the verb's meaning to indicate completion or transformation.
