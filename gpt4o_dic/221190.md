### Contextual Explanation
- "Tining" primarily refers to the distribution of fibers in a material, commonly discussed in the fields of botany and materials science. Understanding how fibers are arranged can influence the material's mechanical properties, such as durability, flexibility, and strength.
- Phrasal examples like "tining patterns" are often used in academic texts discussing the implications of fiber arrangement in engineering and natural sciences.
