### Additional Context
- The term "plimsolled" derives from the "Plimsoll line," named after Samuel Plimsoll, a British politician and social reformer who advocated for the safety of ships. The line signifies the maximum depth to which a ship can be safely loaded, thus preventing overloading and associated hazards at sea.
