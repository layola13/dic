### Additional Context:
The term "hypothenusal" derives from the word "hypotenuse," which specifically refers to the longest side of a right triangle, opposite the right angle. Knowing this term is essential in trigonometry and geometry, as it helps in understanding the relationships between the sides of triangles and their angles.
