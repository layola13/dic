### Contextual Explanation
- **Meaning**: The term highlights a particular focus on smaller structural features at a scale below that of granules, significant in various scientific and engineering fields. 
- **Usage**: Commonly found in technical discussions related to material properties, soil science, and even biological tissues.
- **Examples**: In geological contexts, examining subgranularities might unveil information about the rock's history and composition, while in material sciences, they could influence properties like strength or permeability.
