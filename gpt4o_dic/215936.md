### Additional Context
Syncretism often occurs when different cultural or religious traditions come into contact, leading to the incorporation of beliefs, practices, or rituals from one tradition into another. This can be seen in various historical contexts, such as the syncretism of indigenous religions with Christianity in Latin America or the blending of African spiritual practices with Christianity in the Caribbean.
