### Context
Raffishness typically refers to a quality that straddles the line between charm and disrepute, often marked by a certain nonchalance or disregard for conventional standards. In literature and culture, characters or styles embodying this trait might be both appealing and slightly morally ambiguous, inviting both admiration and caution.
