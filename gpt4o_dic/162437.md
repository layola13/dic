### Explanation
"Preadmiring" combines the prefix "pre-" (before) with "admiring" (to regard with wonder or pleasure). This term generally indicates admiration or appreciation for something that has not yet occurred, often used in contexts like anticipating a performance, artwork, or any upcoming event.
