### Additional Context:
The term "non-Aryans" emerged significantly in the context of 19th and 20th-century racial theories, particularly those promoted by European colonialism and Nazi ideology. However, contemporary understanding emphasizes the social constructs around race, moving away from these outdated classifications. Modern usage often highlights issues of ethnicity, cultural identity, and the impacts of historical marginalization.
