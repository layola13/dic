The word "fullonical" does not have a recognized definition or usage in standard English dictionaries or linguistic resources as of my last knowledge update. It appears to be a non-standard or possibly fictional term. If you're looking for information on a related term or its context, please provide more details or clarify if it's a neologism or specialized term used in a particular field. I can help explore related concepts or terms if that would be helpful!
