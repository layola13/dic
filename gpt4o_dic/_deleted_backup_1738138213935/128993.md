It looks like you wanted a detailed analysis in the same format as the example for the word "what", but for the word "nippitato." However, “nippitato” does not seem to be a recognized English word or term. 

If you meant something else or possibly a variation, please provide more context or correct the term, and I’ll be glad to assist you further!
