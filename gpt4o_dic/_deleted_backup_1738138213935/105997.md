It seems there may be a misunderstanding as the word "knapple" does not appear to be a recognized English term. If "knapple" is intended to represent something specific—perhaps a proper noun, a brand, or a colloquial term—please provide additional context. Meanwhile, I can offer information on words that are similar or help clarify any related concepts. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
