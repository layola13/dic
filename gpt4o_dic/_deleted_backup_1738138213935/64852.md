It seems that "esplees" is not a standard English word, and there might be a confusion or typo. However, if you meant "esplees" in a different context, such as legal or historic uses (like "esplees" in land law referring to profits or benefits of the land), I can certainly provide insights on that concept.

If you're looking for something else or a different word, please clarify!
