The word "bebirine" does not appear to be a standard English word based on my knowledge cutoff in August 2023. It might be a misspelling, a word from another language, or a specialized term not widely recognized in English. If you have a specific context or language in mind, providing additional details could help in identifying or clarifying the term.

For now, I'll provide a template based on the structure you shared, but with placeholders since "bebirine" is not an established English word:

  "word": "bebirine",
