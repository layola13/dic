It seems that "nontonality" might be a typo or an incorrectly spelled term. Unfortunately, I couldn't find any specific information on "nontonality." However, if you meant "tonality," which relates to the musical and artistic concept of a key or a system of sounds, I can elaborate on that if you'd like. Please clarify or provide more context so I can assist you better!
