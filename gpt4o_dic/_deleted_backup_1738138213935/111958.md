It seems that the word "lomatinous" is not a standard English word, and I couldn’t find any recognized definitions, phonetics, or related information for it. It's possible that the term is misspelled or highly specialized within a certain context. 

If you have any additional context or alternative spellings, please share, and I’d be happy to help further!
