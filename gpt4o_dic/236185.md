### Additional Context:
- **Usage in Linguistics**: The term "unmorphologically" is typically used in linguistic discussions to contrast with approaches that do involve the analysis of morphological structures, emphasizing more on semantics, syntax, or overall language use rather than the formation and structure of words.
- **Practical Applications**: This term may be relevant in fields like computational linguistics, language acquisition studies, or theoretical discussions about grammar and syntax, where a more holistic view of language is considered.
