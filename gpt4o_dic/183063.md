  "word": "repolarize",
  "phonetics": "/ˌriːˈpɒləraɪz/",
  "part_of_speech": "verb",
  "translation": "重新极化",
  "definition": "To restore the electrical charge of a cell or membrane after it has become depolarized; commonly used in biological contexts, especially regarding nerve and muscle cells.",
  "example": "After the action potential, the neuron must repolarize before it can fire again.",
  "synonyms": ["restore polarization", "reset"],
  "antonyms": ["depolarize"],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [
      { "sentence": "Cells repolarize after firing an action potential.", "translation": "细胞在产生动作电位后重新极化。" }
    ],
    "present_continuous": [
      { "sentence": "The neurons are repolarizing after the signal.", "translation": "神经元正在信号传递后重新极化。" }
    ],
    "simple_past": [
      { "sentence": "The muscle fibers repolarized quickly after contraction.", "translation": "肌纤维在收缩后迅速重新极化。" }
    ],
    "future": [
      { "sentence": "The cells will repolarize after they have been stimulated.", "translation": "细胞在受到刺激后将重新极化。" }
    ]
  },
  "context": {
    "biological_importance": "Repolarization is critical for the function of excitable tissues, such as nerves and muscles, allowing them to return to their resting state and be ready for the next signal."
  },
  "related_terms": [
    { "term": "depolarize", "definition": "To lose polarization; often refers to the reduction of the difference in charge across a membrane." },
    { "term": "action potential", "definition": "A short-lasting event in which the electrical membrane potential of a cell rapidly rises and falls." }
