### Additional Context

A rondo generally consists of one main theme (the A section), which alternates with different sections (B, C, etc.) providing contrast. The structure can often be described as ABACA, where the A section recurs between contrasting themes, making it a favorite format for many composers such as Mozart and Beethoven.
