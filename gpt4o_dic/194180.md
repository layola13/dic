  "word": "self-ionization",
  "phonetics": "/ˈsɛlfˌaɪənaɪˈzeɪʃən/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "自我离子化",
  "definition": "The process by which a molecule ionizes itself to form ions without the introduction of an external agent.",
  "example": "Water undergoes self-ionization to a small extent, producing hydronium and hydroxide ions.",
  "synonyms": ["autoionization", "self-dissociation"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "context": {
    "chemistry": "Self-ionization is a key concept in acid-base chemistry, illustrating how substances can dissociate into ions.",
    "importance": "Understanding self-ionization helps in comprehending the behavior of solutions, particularly in water as a solvent."
  },
  "related_terms": [
    { "term": "autoionization", "definition": "The same process as self-ionization, often used in a broader context." },
    { "term": "dissociation", "definition": "The process in which molecules break apart into smaller molecules or ions." }

  "scientific_example": {
    "equation": "2 H2O ⇌ H3O⁺ + OH⁻",
    "explanation": "This equation represents the self-ionization of water, where two water molecules produce one hydronium ion and one hydroxide ion."
