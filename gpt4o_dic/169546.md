### Notes:
1. **Usage Context**: "Properer" is less commonly used in modern English; typically, "more proper" is preferred. However, it may be encountered in informal or dialectal contexts.
   
2. **Comparative Formation**: "Proper" itself connotes something that is suitable or appropriate, and "properer" emphasizes an increased degree of that quality.

3. **Transition to More Common Terms**: Usage might shift towards "more proper" to maintain clarity and conformity within standard English grammar.
