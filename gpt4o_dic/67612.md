### Context and Additional Information

**Extroversion** is commonly discussed in psychology, particularly in relation to personality theories like the Big Five Personality Traits. Individuals who score high in extroversion tend to be more energized by social interactions and are often seen as enthusiastic and talkative. They may thrive in environments that require social engagement and collaborative efforts.

In contrast to **introversion**, which refers to a preference for solitary activities and less social interaction, extroversion encompasses characteristics that can play a significant role in professional and personal relationships.
