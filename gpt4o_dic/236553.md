### Notes:
- The term "unodiousnesses" is quite rare and is comprised of the prefix "un-" (indicating negation) and "odiousness," which refers to something that is highly offensive or repugnant. "Unodiousness" would thus denote a state devoid of such negative qualities.
- The usage examples reflect various grammatical tenses and contexts where the term can be appropriately employed.
