### Additional Context

Chimaeroid fishes are part of the subclass Holocephali, which includes a small group of fish that are related to sharks and rays. They typically have large, flat heads and can be distinguished by their unique tooth structure. Their habitat is primarily in deep-sea environments, making them less familiar compared to other more commonly known fish species. The study of chimaeroids can provide insights into evolutionary biology and marine ecology.
