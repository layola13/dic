### Explanation
**"Unadoringly"** stems from the adjective **"adoring,"** which conveys strong love or admiration. By adding the prefix **"un-,"** it negates this admiration. This adverb is typically used to describe a lack of enthusiasm or respect towards someone or something, repeatedly highlighting a dismissive or indifferent viewpoint.
