### Context:
The term "preoppressor" is not commonly found in standard dictionaries; it combines "pre-" (before) with "oppressor" (someone who oppresses). It's often used in discussions around social justice, politics, and power dynamics to refer to forces or individuals that create oppressive conditions before overt acts of oppression occur.
