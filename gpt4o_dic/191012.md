It seems that "scamblingly" is not a recognized English word. It could be a typographical error or perhaps a misspelling of another term. If you meant a different word or concept, please clarify, and I'll be happy to help with that! For example, if you meant "scrambling," I can provide an in-depth analysis on that. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
