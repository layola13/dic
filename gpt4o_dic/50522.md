### Context and Explanation:

- **Definition**: *Depth-of-focus* is crucial in photography and optical sciences, referring specifically to the range in which objects appear sharp in an image. This is influenced by factors like the camera's aperture setting and lens focal length.

- **Usage**: It is commonly discussed in contexts such as photography, cinematography, and optical engineering. For instance, a larger aperture results in a shallower depth-of-focus, affecting how much of the scene is in focus. This term helps photographers make informed decisions about composition and focus, impacting how the final image is perceived.

- **Phrases**: Terms like *shallow depth-of-focus* and *deep depth-of-focus* describe the extent of the focus range, affecting the artistic quality of the images produced.
