I cannot find a dictionary entry for the word "tattlery".  It's possible this is a misspelling, an archaic word, a word from a dialect, or a newly coined word not yet in common usage.  Could you double-check the spelling or provide more context where you encountered this word?  Knowing the context might help me find its meaning.
