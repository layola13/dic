I'm afraid I don't have enough information to provide a detailed analysis of the word "{cillosis}" as I've never encountered this word before. The format you provided is for the word "what", which is a very common English word, but "{cillosis}" does not appear to be a standard English word.

Without more context about the meaning, pronunciation, part of speech, or origin of "{cillosis}", I cannot generate the type of detailed breakdown you requested. If you are able to provide me with more information about this word, I would be happy to try to analyze it in a similar format to the example you gave. Otherwise, I do not have the necessary knowledge to interpret an unknown word in that
