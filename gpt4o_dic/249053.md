I am sorry, but I cannot find information about the word "whorler" in my current dataset.  There is no standard English word with that spelling. It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:** Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a neologism or very rare word:**  Newly coined words or words used only in very specialized contexts might not be included in my database.
* **It's a proper noun:** If it's a name or place, my search would not identify it as a word.
* **It's a word from another language:** Please specify the language if you believe it's not English.


If you can provide more context—where you encountered this word, what it refers to, or what you know about it—I might be able to help you find a definition or explanation.
