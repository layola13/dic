  "historical_context": {
    "background": "The phlogiston theory, proposed in the 17th century by Johann Joachim Becher and later developed by Georg Ernst Stahl, suggested that a fire-like element called 'phlogiston' was released during combustion. The theory was dominant until the emergence of modern chemistry and the discovery of oxygen in the late 18th century, which provided a new understanding of combustion.",
    "importance": "The phlogiston concept illustrated early scientific attempts to understand chemical reactions and laid the groundwork for future developments in chemistry."
