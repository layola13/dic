### Explanation:
- **Word Origin**: The prefix "semi-" indicates partial or half, suggesting that the term is used to describe concepts or methods that integrate some elements of psychology without being fully psychological.
- **Context of Use**: This term may appear in discussions of therapeutic techniques, research methods, or theoretical frameworks that borrow from psychology but do not fully align with its principles. It may be particularly relevant in interdisciplinary fields, combining psychology with other disciplines such as sociology or education.
