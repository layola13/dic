### Additional Context
**Epizooety** refers to ecological relationships where organisms establish themselves on the surfaces of larger organisms, often without causing harm. Such relationships can provide benefits, like transportation or increased access to resources, for the epizooetic organisms while being neutral or beneficial to the host. Examples include barnacles on the shells of marine animals and lichens growing on the bark of trees.
