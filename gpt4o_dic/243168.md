### Context and Information

**Varices** primarily refers to abnormal vein dilation, commonly known as **varicose veins**. This condition often affects the superficial veins in the lower extremities and can lead to symptoms such as swelling, aching, and a heavy feeling in the legs. Risk factors include prolonged sitting or standing, obesity, pregnancy, and genetic predisposition. Treatments can vary from lifestyle changes and compression stockings to more advanced interventions like sclerotherapy or surgery in severe cases.
