### Contextual Note:
The term "hylotheist" combines "hylo-" (referring to matter) and "-theist" (referring to belief in a divine entity), emphasizing a viewpoint where matter is considered central to understanding existence and divinity. This term is often used in philosophical discussions to contrast with idealism and spiritualism.
