### Description

**Monostatic** typically refers to technologies, especially in radar and communication, where both the transmitter and receiver are at the same location. This contrasts with bistatic systems, where they are separated. Monostatic systems are often simpler and less expensive but may have limitations regarding range and accuracy compared to their bistatic counterparts.
