### Contextual Overview:
SDR, or Special Drawing Rights, serves as an international reserve asset created to supplement its member countries' official reserves. It is not a currency but can be exchanged among countries for freely usable currencies, thus providing liquidity to the global economy during financial crises. The value of SDR is based on a basket of key currencies, making it a pivotal tool in international finance.
