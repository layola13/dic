  "word": "epicycloid",
  "phonetics": "/ˈɛpɪˌsaɪklɔɪd/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "外接圆生成的轨迹",
  "definition": "A type of curve traced by a point on the circumference of a circle (the 'epicycle') that rolls around the outside of another circle (the 'base circle').",
  "example": "The trajectory of the point on the rolling circle creates an epicycloid.",
  "synonyms": [],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "context": [
      "In mathematics, epicycloids are studied in the context of geometric curves.",
      "The design of certain gears and mechanisms can incorporate the principles of epicycloids."
    ]
  },
  "properties": {
    "equation": "The parametric equations for an epicycloid can be expressed as: x(θ) = (R + r) cos(θ) - r cos((R/r + 1)θ) and y(θ) = (R + r) sin(θ) - r sin((R/r + 1)θ), where R is the radius of the base circle and r is the radius of the rolling circle.",
    "applications": [
      "Used in the design of various mechanical systems, such as cam profiles and gear systems.",
      "Found in the study of cycloidal motion."
    ]
  },
  "shapes": {
    "characteristics": [
      "An epicycloid can vary in number of cusps depending on the ratio of the radii of the circles involved.",
      "Asymmetric epicycloids are possible when non-equal radii are used."
