### Notes on Usage:
"Gluttoness" is often used in a more informal or humorous context, and it may carry a negative connotation when describing someone’s eating habits. It’s less common than the masculine form "glutton," but it emphasizes femininity in usage. The root "glutton" itself comes from a longer tradition of describing those who overindulge in food or drink.
