It seems that "treatiser" is not a recognized English word, and I wasn't able to find specific information regarding it. However, if you meant "treatise," which refers to a formal written work that discusses a particular subject in detail, I can provide an analysis for that instead. Please let me know if you'd like me to proceed with "treatise" or if you have another term in mind!
