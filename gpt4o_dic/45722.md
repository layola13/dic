It seems like "curveyer" is not a recognized English word. However, if you meant "curvier," which describes a shape having more curves, I can provide a detailed analysis. Here’s the breakdown based on that assumption:

```json
{
  "word": "curvier",
  "phonetics": "/ˈkɜːrviər/",
  "part_of_speech": "adj.",
  "translation": "更曲线的",
  "definition": "Having more curves or a more rounded shape than another object or entity.",
  "example": "This dress looks curvier than the last one I tried on.",
  "synonyms": ["rounder", "sinuous", "wavier"],
  "antonyms": ["straighter", "flatter"],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [
      { "sentence": "This style is curvier than it used to be.", "translation": "这种风格比以前更曲线。" }
    ],
    "present_continuous": [
      { "sentence": "She is wearing a curvier silhouette today.", "translation": "她今天穿着更曲线的服装。" }
    ],
    "simple_past": [
      { "sentence": "Last year's fashion was curvier.", "translation": "去年的时尚更曲线。" }
    ],
    "simple_future": [
      { "sentence": "The upcoming collections will be curvier.", "translation": "即将发布的系列将会更曲线。" }
    ]
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [
      { "phrase": "Curvier than ever", "translation": "比以往更加曲线" },
      { "phrase": "A curvier approach to design", "translation": "一种更曲线的设计方式" }
    ]
  }
}
```

If "curveyer" means something else or if you were looking for a different word, please provide more context or clarification!
