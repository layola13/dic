**Note**: The term "politicses" is rarely used in contemporary English. "Politics" usually serves as both singular and plural, but it can be contextually acceptable to refer to distinct branches or frameworks of political study as "politicses." Nonetheless, the standard use typically retains "politics" for both forms.
