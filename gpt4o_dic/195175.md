  "translation": "半确定性的",
  "definition": "Describing a system or process that exhibits a mix of deterministic and probabilistic behavior, where some elements can be predicted with certainty while others are inherently random.",
  "example": "The algorithm operates in a semideterministic manner, ensuring predictable results in some scenarios while allowing for variability in others.",

  "antonyms": ["deterministic", "random"],
  "usage": {
    "contextual_use": [
      { "sentence": "In semideterministic models, certain outcomes can be anticipated but others may vary based on input conditions.", "translation": "在半确定性模型中，某些结果可以预见，但其他结果可能会根据输入条件变化。" },
      { "sentence": "Semideterministic systems are common in fields like computer science and economics, where prediction is crucial but uncertainty exists.", "translation": "半确定性系统在计算机科学和经济学等领域很常见，在这些领域中，预测至关重要但仍然存在不确定性。" }
