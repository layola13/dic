It seems that the term "peanism" does not appear in established English language references. It may be a misspelling, a rare term, or a neologism not yet recognized broadly. If you could provide context or clarify its intended use, I would be glad to assist further. 

If it's a different term entirely that you're looking for, please let me know!
