### Additional Context:
**Hemimetabola** refers specifically to insects like grasshoppers, mayflies, and cockroaches. Unlike holometabolous insects (like butterflies), hemimetabolous insects do not undergo a pupal stage and instead grow progressively through a series of nymph stages until they reach maturity, resembling adults throughout their development. This type of metamorphosis allows these insects to adapt more rapidly to their environments compared to holometabolous counterparts.
