The word "don'ted" appears to be a nonstandard or informal use, possibly derived from the contraction "don't" with the addition of an "-ed" ending, which suggests a past participle form. However, "don't" itself is a contraction of "do not," and such a transformation does not exist in standard English.

### Additional Context

- The proper past form for the contraction "don't" would be "didn't" when referring to the past tense of "do not."
