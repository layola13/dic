### Contextual Overview
Spongoblasts are specialized cells found within sponges, a group of aquatic animals known for their porous bodies. These cells play a crucial role in forming the sponge's structure and are responsible for synthesizing the collagen and other materials that maintain its integrity. Understanding spongoblasts is important in fields like marine biology and developmental biology, as researchers explore the mechanisms of cellular differentiation and tissue formation.
