### Context and Etymology
"Unbrother" is a rare and more abstract term that may not be commonly found in everyday language. It’s derived from the prefix "un-" which typically means to reverse or negate, combined with "brother," referring to a male sibling or one who shares a bond typically described as brotherhood.

It's not widely used in modern English and may appear more in literary or metaphorical contexts rather than in everyday speech. The idea it conveys revolves around severing familial bonds or kinship ties, often in emotionally charged circumstances or conflicts.
