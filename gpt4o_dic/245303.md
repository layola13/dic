### Context and Usage

"Vivo" primarily originates from Latin and is predominantly used in scientific and medical contexts, especially related to biology. It describes experiments or observations that occur in a living organism, in contrast to "in vitro," which refers to studies conducted outside a living organism, often in controlled environments like test tubes. This term is crucial for understanding how biological processes occur within the natural settings of living systems, making it a vital term in fields such as pharmacology, physiology, and biotechnology.
