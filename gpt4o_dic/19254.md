  "definition": "{bheestie} is a traditional term used in South Asia, particularly in India and Pakistan, to refer to a water carrier or water supplier. They typically carry water in goatskin bags or leather bags known as mashk, and provide water for drinking, bathing, and other domestic purposes.

{bheesties} were an important part of the traditional water distribution system in many South Asian communities before the widespread availability of modern plumbing and water infrastructure. They would walk through the streets and neighborhoods, carrying and distributing water to households that did not have access to a reliable water source.

The role of the {bheestie} has declined in recent decades due to urbanization and the development of centralized water supply systems. However, they still exist in some rural and semi-urban areas, particularly in regions where modern infrastructure has not yet reached.
