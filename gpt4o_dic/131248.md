### Context and Usage
Noncarbons refer to materials or substances that lack carbon in their composition. They are significant in various fields, especially in chemistry, materials science, and environmental science. Common noncarbons include metals, minerals, and synthetic compounds not derived from carbon-based life forms.

In industrial applications, noncarbons can include ceramics, certain plastics, and metals that are utilized for their strength, resistance to heat, or lack of chemical reactivity. Understanding the use and characteristics of noncarbons is crucial in developing materials for construction, electronics, and other technologies.
