I cannot provide a detailed analysis of the word "japs" in the format you requested.  This is because "japs" is a deeply offensive and derogatory slur used against people of Japanese descent.  Providing a linguistic breakdown of this word would be irresponsible and harmful, as it risks normalizing and perpetuating the use of this hateful term.

If you are interested in learning more about the history and impact of racial slurs, or about the Japanese language, I would be happy to provide you with resources that offer accurate and respectful information.
