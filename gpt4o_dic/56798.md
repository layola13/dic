### Notes
- "Dore" is not commonly used in contemporary English outside of specific dialects or poetic contexts. It may also refer to a variation of "door" or fit into informal phrases, particularly in creative or expressive language.
- Much of its use might lean into stylistic or idiomatic expressions rather than standard definitions.
