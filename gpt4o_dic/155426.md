### Additional Context:
Phellogen, also known as cork cambium, is a type of lateral meristem that contributes to secondary growth in woody plants. It produces cork cells, which protect the plant from environmental damage and prevent water loss. Understanding phellogen is essential for studying plant physiology and anatomy.
