### Additional Context:
- **Non-Restricting Clauses**: Typically introduced by conjunctions like "which". They add extra detail without limiting or altering the meaning of the sentence. For example, in "My car, which is red, is parked outside," the clause "which is red" gives extra information but isn’t necessary for identifying "my car."
- **Usage in Writing**: Understanding non-restricting constructions is essential for improving clarity and style in both written and spoken English.
