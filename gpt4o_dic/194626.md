Here’s a detailed breakdown of the term "self-thinning":

```json
{
  "word": "self-thinning",
  "phonetics": "/sɛlfˈθɪnɪŋ/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "自我稀疏",
  "definition": "A biological process in which a population decreases in density as individuals grow larger and resources become limited, leading to increased competition.",
  "example": "In forestry, self-thinning often occurs in young stands where trees compete for light, resulting in fewer trees as they mature.",
  "synonyms": [
    "density-dependent mortality",
    "natural thinning"
  ],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [
      { "sentence": "Self-thinning occurs in many plant species.", "translation": "许多植物物种中发生自我稀疏。" }
    ],
    "present_continuous": [
      { "sentence": "The trees are experiencing self-thinning as they compete for resources.", "translation": "树木正在经历自我稀疏，因为它们为了资源竞争。" }
    ],
    "past_simple": [
      { "sentence": "The forest underwent self-thinning last year.", "translation": "这片森林去年经历了自我稀疏。" }
    ],
    "future_simple": [
      { "sentence": "The ecosystem will benefit from self-thinning in the coming years.", "translation": "生态系统将在未来几年受益于自我稀疏。" }
    ]
  },
  "context": {
    "biological_significance": "Self-thinning is a crucial factor in population dynamics, as it helps maintain healthy ecosystems by reducing overcrowding and fostering biodiversity.",
    "application": "In agriculture and forestry, understanding self-thinning can improve management practices, such as determining optimal planting density."
  },
  "related_terms": [
    { "term": "competitive exclusion", "definition": "The principle that two species competing for the same resources cannot coexist." },
    { "term": "carrying capacity", "definition": "The maximum population size that an environment can sustain." }
