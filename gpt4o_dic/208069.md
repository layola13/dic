I cannot provide a detailed analysis of the word "storkling" in the same format as your example for "what," because I do not have access to a comprehensive dictionary or linguistic database that contains detailed grammatical information for every word, including rarer words like "storkling."  My knowledge about "storkling" is limited to its meaning as a young stork.  I cannot generate the extensive grammatical examples shown in your provided data for "what."
