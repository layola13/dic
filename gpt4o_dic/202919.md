### Additional Context
Sones are a unit used to express perceived loudness rather than actual measurable sound pressure level. This makes sones a subjective measure; for instance, a sound perceived as twice as loud as a reference level is assigned a value of 2 sones, which effectively captures human hearing's logarithmic response to sound intensity.
