It seems there might be a misunderstanding regarding the term "corollet," which is not a recognized English word in standard dictionaries. However, if you meant "corollary," I can provide a detailed analysis of that term instead. Here's the breakdown:

```json
{
  "word": "corollary",
  "phonetics": "/ˈkɔːr.ə.lɛr.i/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun, adjective",
  "translation": "推论, 必然结果",
  "definition": {
    "noun": "A proposition that follows from one already proved, or a situation that is a natural consequence of something.",
    "adjective": "Related to or derived from a proposition or statement."
  },
  "example": "The corollary of the decision was immediate action.",
  "synonyms": ["result", "consequence", "outcome"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [
      { "sentence": "The corollary explains the phenomenon.", "translation": "这个推论解释了现象。" }
    ],
    "simple_past": [
      { "sentence": "He realized the corollary of his mistakes.", "translation": "他意识到他错误的必然结果。" }
    ],
    "future_simple": [
      { "sentence": "The corollary will become clear in time.", "translation": "这个必然结果会随着时间变得清晰。" }
    ]
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [
      { "phrase": "As a corollary," , "translation": "作为必然结果，" },
      { "phrase": "The corollary relationship is evident," , "translation": "这种推论关系是显而易见的。" }
    ]
  }
}
```
