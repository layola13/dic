### Contextual Explanation:
Vaporosities refer to how easily vapors can move through or be stored in materials. This concept is frequently applied in geology, materials science, and environmental studies, particularly when discussing the permeability of soils or other porous materials in relation to gas exchange and storage capacity. Understanding vaporosities is crucial when selecting materials for applications like insulation, filtration, or any process involving gas interactions.
