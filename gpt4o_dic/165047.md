  "word": "preignition",
  "phonetics": "/priːɪɡˈnɪʃən/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "预点火",
  "definition": "The phenomenon where the air-fuel mixture in an internal combustion engine ignites prematurely before the intended ignition event by the spark plug.",
  "example": "Preignition can lead to engine knocking and reduced performance.",
  "synonyms": ["premature ignition", "early ignition"],
  "antonyms": ["normal ignition"],
  "usage": {
    "context": [
      "Preignition can occur due to engine overheating.",
      "Many high-compression engines are sensitive to preignition."
    ]
  },
  "causes": {
    "examples": [
      { "cause": "Overheating of the combustion chamber", "description": "High temperatures can ignite the mixture before the spark." },
      { "cause": "Using a lower octane fuel than recommended", "description": "This can make the fuel more prone to premature ignition." },
      { "cause": "Incorrect ignition timing", "description": "If the timing is too advanced, preignition may occur." }
    ]
  },
  "effects": {
    "examples": [
      { "effect": "Engine damage", "description": "Can cause significant wear and tear on engine components." },
      { "effect": "Loss of power", "description": "Preignition can result in decreased engine performance and efficiency." }
    ]
  },
  "prevention": {
    "strategies": [
      { "strategy": "Use fuel with a higher octane rating", "description": "This helps prevent preignition." },
      { "strategy": "Regular engine maintenance", "description": "Keeps components in good condition to reduce preignition risk." },
      { "strategy": "Monitor engine temperature", "description": "Make sure it stays within the recommended range." }
    ]
