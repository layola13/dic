### Additional Notes
- **Usage in Context**: The term "nonegregiousnesses" is often used in formal or academic contexts, particularly when discussing evaluations where minor faults do not hinder the overall quality or acceptance of a work.
- **Complexity**: This word is a combination of the prefix "non-" (indicating negation) and "egregious," which means extraordinary in a bad way, thus making "nonegregious" signify something that does not stand out for negative reasons. The plural form suggests referring to multiple instances or qualities of such minor issues.
