**Overview:**
"Passivizable" is an adjective used to describe verbs that can be transformed into the passive voice. This transformation allows the focus of a sentence to shift from the doer of the action to the recipient of the action. Understanding which verbs are passivizable is important in grammar and writing for constructing effective sentences and clarity in communication.
