**Context**: Op-arts emerged primarily in the 1960s as a distinctive movement within modern art, characterized by the use of geometric patterns and color contrasts to create dynamic visual effects. Famous artists like Bridget Riley and Victor Vasarely are well-known for their contributions to this genre. The science of perception plays a key role in how op-arts are perceived, making it a fascinating field for both artists and viewers.
