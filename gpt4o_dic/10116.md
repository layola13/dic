The key points about the word "apohyal" are:

1. It is a noun referring to a small bone in the hyoid apparatus of vertebrates.
2. The apohyal connects the ceratohyal and basihyal bones, and is an important part of the complex mechanisms involved in swallowing and vocalization.
3. The usage examples demonstrate how the apohyal is described in the present, past, and future tenses, highlighting its anatomical location and functional significance.
4. There are no listed synonyms or antonyms, as this is a relatively specialized anatomical term.

Overall, the apohyal is a key component of the vertebrate hyoid apparatus, playing a crucial role in feeding and speech-related functions. The description provides the necessary details to understand this specific bone and its relevance in vertebrate biology.
