### Additional Context
"Perigenetic" often appears in discussions of genetics, particularly in the context of how environmental factors and cellular context influence gene expression and heredity. It combines "peri-", meaning around or surrounding, with "genetic", relating to genes, thus highlighting the importance of external influences on genetic information and hereditary processes.
