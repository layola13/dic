I cannot find a word "tinger" in any standard English dictionary or word list.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:** Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word (a book, a conversation, etc.), it might help me understand what you intended.
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It's a newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context. If this is the case, providing context is crucial.
* **It's a proper noun:**  If it's a name or place, please let me know.

Please provide more information so I can assist you better.
