### Context and Background
The "dronte," commonly referenced as the "dodo," is one of the most famous examples of extinction caused by human activities. Once thriving on Mauritius, it became extinct in the late 17th century due to overhunting and the introduction of invasive species. The term has since evolved into a cultural reference for loss and extinction in biodiversity discussions.
