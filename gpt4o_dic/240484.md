It seems there might be a typo with the word "untedious." It might be intended as "unTedious" or "unteatious." Could you please clarify the word you meant to analyze? If you're looking for "untedious" as a concept, it generally relates to being not boring or tedious, but it isn't a commonly used term. 

If you're looking for similar terms or other related concepts, feel free to specify, and I can help with that!
