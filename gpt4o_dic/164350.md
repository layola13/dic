### Additional Context
"Preembarrass" is a relatively rare term that combines the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") with "embarrass." It seems to often refer to social situations where one uses humor or ironic commentary to bring up potentially embarrassing topics preemptively, which can sometimes serve to diffuse the awkwardness. This might be employed intentionally in humorous contexts or as a way of coping with potential social faux pas.
