I am sorry, but I cannot find any information about the word "urrhodin" in my database.  It is possible this is a misspelling, a very rare or technical term, or a word not yet included in my knowledge base.  Could you please double-check the spelling or provide more context about where you encountered this word?  Knowing the subject area (e.g., chemistry, biology, a specific field of study) would help me in my search.
