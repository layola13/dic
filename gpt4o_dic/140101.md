### Context and Explanation
The term "off-licensee" is particularly common in the UK and refers to establishments that are licensed to sell alcohol for consumption off the premises, meaning the purchased items cannot be consumed on-site. This can encompass liquor stores or shops that possess an off-licence to legally dispense alcoholic beverages. 

### Usage Notes
Off-licensees must comply with specific regulations regarding the sale of alcohol, particularly to prevent sales to underage customers.
