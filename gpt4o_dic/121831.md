### Additional Context
"Misrelies" is a verb formed by adding the prefix "mis-" to "relies," suggesting an incorrect or faulty reliance. It's not commonly used in everyday conversation, so context matters significantly when applying it in sentences. Always consider the reliability of the sources or individuals you depend on to avoid misreliance.
