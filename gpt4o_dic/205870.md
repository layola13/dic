I cannot find the word "squirarch" in any standard dictionaries or linguistic resources.  It's possible this is:

* **A neologism:** A newly coined word not yet widely adopted.
* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps a similar-sounding word exists.
* **A technical term:**  Specific to a niche field or community.  If you can provide context where you encountered this word (e.g., a book, article, game), it would help me find its meaning.
* **A fictional word:**  From a book, movie, or game.

Please provide more information so I can assist you better.
