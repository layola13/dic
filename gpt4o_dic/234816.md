### Additional Context
The term "unindignant" combines the prefix "un-" (indicating negation) with "indignant," which refers to feelings of anger or annoyance provoked by what is perceived as unfair treatment. Therefore, "unindignant" describes a lack of those feelings, suggesting either apathy or acceptance of the situation at hand. This word could be relevant in discussions regarding social justice, emotional responses to news, or personal encounters with unfairness.
