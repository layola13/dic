### Additional Context
**Osteozoa** generally refers to animals within the phylum Chordata that have a bony skeleton. This includes all vertebrates and distinguishes them from invertebrates, which lack a backbone or bony structures. The study of osteozoa is important in fields like paleontology and evolutionary biology, as understanding their development can provide insights into the evolution of life on Earth.
