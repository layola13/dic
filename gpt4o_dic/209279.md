### Additional Context
"Sub-prime" refers primarily to the context of finance, particularly in lending and mortgages. It gained significant attention during the late 2000s financial crisis, resulting from the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage market, where many borrowers defaulted on their loans. This term serves as a crucial part of discussions regarding credit risk and economic stability.
