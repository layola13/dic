### Context and Background
Ecoterrorism typically refers to radical environmentalists who engage in illegal activities to protect the environment, often through violent means. It is a controversial term that can invoke debate regarding the balance between activism for environmental protection and the legality of the methods used. Various incidents in the past involving sabotage and property destruction have accumulated to form this concept, which authorities often associate with criminal activities. 

Understanding ecoterrorism is crucial in the broader conversation about environmental activism, its methods, and ethics.
