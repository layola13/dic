### Context
Hyetographs are essential tools in meteorology and hydrology. By visualizing rainfall data, they help in understanding precipitation patterns, predicting floods, and managing water resources. They are particularly useful when combined with other data, such as the area’s topography and drainage systems, to assess potential impacts from rainfall.
