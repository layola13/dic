### Context and Explanation:
Lithography, originally developed in the late 18th century, revolutionized the printing industry. It relies on the immiscibility of oil and water, which allows for the creation of both images and texts on the same surface. This method is not only crucial in traditional printmaking but also plays a significant role in modern techniques, including semiconductor manufacturing in electronics.
