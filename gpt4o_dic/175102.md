### Context and Usage:
- **Rads** is particularly relevant in fields such as medical physics, radiation therapy, and environmental safety, where it's crucial to quantify the amount of radiation absorbed. While rads were commonly used historically, they are often replaced by the more universally adopted unit called Gray (Gy), where 1 rad equals 0.01 Gy. 
- Understanding how to measure and interpret radiation in rads can help professionals gauge potential risks to health and safety in environments with radiation exposure.
