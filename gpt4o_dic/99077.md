### Context and Usage
"Interaxial" is primarily used in technical fields such as film production (particularly in 3D cinematography) where it refers to the distance between two camera axes. This distance significantly influences the perception of depth in the final image. Additionally, it's applicable in engineering contexts when discussing components that operate in relation to different axes.
