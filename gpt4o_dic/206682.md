### Additional Context
- **Note**: The term "stationeries" is less common than "stationery," which functions both as a singular and plural form in everyday usage. "Stationery" refers to the broad category of writing materials and supplies.
- **Usage**: While "stationeries" may be technically correct, it's often more practical to use "stationery" in both singular and plural contexts to refer to office supplies collectively.
