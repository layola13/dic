### Overview

**EKG** stands for *electrocardiogram*, and it’s a crucial diagnostic tool used in medicine to assess heart function by detecting the electrical signals that trigger heartbeats. It's vital for diagnosing various heart conditions, monitoring heart health, and guiding treatment. 

The EKG process is non-invasive and typically takes just a few minutes, providing essential data that can inform healthcare decisions.
