  },
  "hazards": {
    "radiotoxicity": "Francium is highly radioactive and poses severe health risks.",
    "handling": "Due to its extreme rarity and radioactivity, handling francium requires special precautions."
  },
  "uses": {
    "research": "Primarily for scientific research to study the behavior of alkali metals.",
    "applications": "Limited applications due to its short half-life."
  },
  "notable_fact": "Francium has an extremely short half-life of about 22 minutes for its most stable isotope, making it one of the least stable naturally occurring elements."
