### Explanation:
**Nonmanifestnesses** is a complex noun derived from the root word "manifest," which refers to something that is clearly visible or obvious. By attaching "non-" at the beginning, the word suggests the opposite—qualities or states that are hidden, obscure, or not easily perceived. This term can appear in philosophical discussions, scientific inquiries, or psychological contexts, emphasizing phenomena that cannot be readily observed or understood.
