### Contextual Explanation:
"Eunomian" refers to the followers of Eunomius, who were known for their belief that God’s essence is fully knowable and that this understanding could be reached through rational thought. This perspective was significant in the context of early Christian theological debates about the nature of God, particularly in relation to the concept of the Trinity, which posits a complex understanding of God as three distinct persons in one essence. The Eunomians were often at odds with other Christian sects that held a more mysterious view of God's nature.
