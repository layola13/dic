### Additional Context:
"Experted" is a less commonly used term as it is derived from "expert," and many speakers might prefer using "specialized" or "demonstrated expertise." While "expert" is typically used as a noun or adjective, its verb form is not standard in everyday English, leading to potential confusion. It's often better to express this idea through other phrases or synonyms to ensure clarity.
