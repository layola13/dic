### Additional Context:
- **Origin**: The term "nonce" comes from the Middle English phrase "for the nonce," meaning "for this occasion."
- **Common Use**: In modern security contexts, particularly in cryptography, a nonce is an arbitrary number that can only be used once, which helps prevent replay attacks and ensures security in communication protocols.
