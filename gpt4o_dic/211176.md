### Explanation
- **Etymology**: The prefix "sub-" indicates "below" or "slightly," combined with "tepid," which refers to moderately warm, typically used in relation to liquids.
- **Concept**: Subtepidly is often used to convey a lack of warmth or enthusiasm in actions or conditions, reflecting a quality that is less than ideally warm. In culinary contexts, it can indicate the appropriate serving temperature for certain soups or drinks.
