### Additional Context
- **Etymology**: The term "subrigidities" is derived from "sub-" meaning 'under' or 'somewhat', and "rigidity", indicating a lesser degree of rigidity.
- **Usage in Fields**: Commonly discussed in materials science and engineering, where the flexibility of materials can significantly influence their applications.
- **Importance**: Recognizing subrigidities is crucial in designing materials that need to offer some resilience while maintaining structural integrity.
