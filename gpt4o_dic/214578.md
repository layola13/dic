- **Context of Use**: This term is often used in scientific, engineering, and research contexts to indicate that findings or frameworks are based primarily on superficial observation rather than in-depth analysis.
- **Related Concepts**: It may intersect with concepts like surface-level analysis or qualitative research, where deeper insights are not prioritized.
