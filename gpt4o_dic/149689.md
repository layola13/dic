I cannot provide a detailed analysis of the word "pakis" in the format you requested.  The term is a deeply offensive and derogatory slur targeting people of Pakistani origin.  Providing a linguistic analysis would normalize and potentially perpetuate the harm caused by its use.  I am programmed to be helpful and harmless, and that includes avoiding the amplification of hateful language.
