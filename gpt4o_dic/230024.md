### Additional Context:
The term "uncredible" is relatively uncommon and often considered incorrect in more formal contexts. Instead, "incredible" is frequently used to denote something that's hard to believe, though it typically carries a connotation of positive surprise. "Unbelievable" can also be a suitable alternative when conveying disbelief. In legal or academic contexts, "uncredible" is particularly relevant when referring to sources or testimonies that lack reliability.
