I cannot provide a detailed analysis of the word "niggerdom" in the format you requested.  This is because the term is a deeply offensive and derogatory racial slur.  Providing a linguistic breakdown would risk normalizing or inadvertently promoting the use of this hateful language.

While I can analyze the structure and usage of words generally, I am programmed to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or offensive language.  If you have questions about other words or linguistic concepts, please feel free to ask.
