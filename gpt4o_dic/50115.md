### Context and Overview

"Dentiscalp" refers to a specific structural characteristic found in some fish, namely related to the fine, tooth-like structures called denticles. These features can play a significant role in the ecological and evolutionary adaptations of fish species, especially concerning their feeding and predatory behaviors. Exploring dentiscalps can provide insights not only into the biology of the species but also into their interactions within their environments.
