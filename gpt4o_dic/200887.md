### Additional Context:
The slinky was invented in the early 1940s by Richard James, who intended it as a device to stabilize sensitive instruments on ships during World War II. It has become a popular toy, particularly due to its ability to "walk" down stairs and its mesmerizing movements, which have inspired a wide range of educational uses in science to demonstrate principles of physics, such as potential and kinetic energy.
