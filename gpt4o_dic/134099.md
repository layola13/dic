### Contextual Explanation
"Nonimmanences" is primarily used in philosophical discussions, particularly those contrasting immanence and transcendence. It encompasses ideas that exist or pertain to external conditions rather than being an inherent quality of the subject in question. This term can be applied across various fields such as metaphysics, sociology, and cultural studies, where the analysis of external influences on contexts or systems is essential for comprehension.
