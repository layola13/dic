It seems there might be a misunderstanding with the word you're asking aboutâ€”"sarcel." This doesn't appear to be a recognized English word. If you meant "socket" or "carcel" (Spanish for jail), please clarify or provide more context so I can assist you better.

If you're looking for information on a similar-sounding word or have a specific context in mind, let me know, and I'll do my best to help!
