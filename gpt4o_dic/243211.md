### Additional Context:
Varisse, commonly referred to as varicose veins, often results from increased pressure in the veins due to prolonged periods of standing, obesity, or pregnancy. Symptoms may include aching, fatigue, or swelling in the affected areas. While changes in lifestyle, like exercise and weight management, can help mitigate the condition, medical interventions such as sclerotherapy or surgery may sometimes be necessary for severe cases.
