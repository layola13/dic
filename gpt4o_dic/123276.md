### Additional Context
The term "monoecian" is often used in botany to describe a reproductive strategy in which individual organisms possess both male and female reproductive organs. This strategy can be advantageous for plants, as it increases the chances of reproduction even in low-pollinator environments. Common examples include corn and cucumbers, which can ensure fruitful reproduction through either self-pollination or cross-pollination with neighboring plants. The opposite of monoecious plants are dioecious plants, which have distinct male and female individuals.
