### Context and Additional Information:
- The term "Milesian" is often associated with ancient Greek philosophers like Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, who resided in Miletus, a significant center of learning in the 6th century BCE.
- These thinkers are notable for their contributions to early natural philosophy and for laying the groundwork for later scientific thought, moving away from mythological explanations of the world toward more rational and systematic approaches.
