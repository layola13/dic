### Explanation
Hydrotropism is an important concept in botany that highlights how plants adapt to their environment by directing their growth toward water sources, which is crucial for their survival. This response is particularly significant in arid regions where water availability can be inconsistent. If you need further details on its biological significance or examples, feel free to ask!
