### Context and Usage

"Iwis" is a term that has fallen out of common usage and is typically found in older literature or dialects. Its modern equivalents, such as "indeed" or "certainly," capture the essence of affirmation that "iwis" conveys. It's mainly used for stylistic or historical purposes in writing or poetry. Although it might be recognized by some readers, it’s advisable to use more contemporary terms in everyday conversation to ensure clarity.
