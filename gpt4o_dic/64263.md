It seems that "equipondious" might not be a widely recognized English word, as I'm unable to find substantial information about it. Itâ€™s possible that it could be a misspelling, a very rare term, or a specialized word that isn't commonly used.

If you have any additional context about where you encountered the word or the subject it relates to, I may be able to assist you better. Please share more details!
