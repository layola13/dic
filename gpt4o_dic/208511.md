### Additional Context:
"Strep" commonly refers to various infections caused by the Streptococcus bacteria, the most well-known being strep throat, which is marked by painful swallowing, fever, and red, swollen tonsils. It can also lead to other conditions like scarlet fever or rheumatic fever if untreated. Detection typically involves a throat swab test followed by antibiotic treatment for effective recovery.
