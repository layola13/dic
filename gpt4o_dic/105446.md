I cannot provide a detailed analysis of the word "kikes" in the format you requested.  This word is a deeply offensive and derogatory slur targeting Jewish people.  Providing a linguistic breakdown would normalize and potentially amplify the harm caused by its use.  Instead of analyzing the word itself, I strongly encourage you to learn about the history and impact of antisemitic slurs and the importance of using respectful and inclusive language.
