好的，下面是对英文单词“reactances”的详细解析：

```json
{
  "word": "reactances",
  "phonetics": "/rɪˈæktənsɪz/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "反应阻抗",
  "definition": "In electrical engineering, reactance is the measure of the opposition that a circuit presents to a current when a voltage is applied, due to the inductance and capacitance of the circuit.",
  "example": "The reactances in the circuit affect the overall impedance.",
  "synonyms": ["impedance", "opposition"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [
      { "sentence": "The reactances in the circuit are calculated using specific formulas.", "translation": "电路中的反应阻抗是通过特定公式计算的。" }
    ],
    "present_continuous": [
      { "sentence": "The engineers are measuring the reactances of the components.", "translation": "工程师们正在测量组件的反应阻抗。" }
    ],
    "simple_past": [
      { "sentence": "They calculated the reactances before the experiment.", "translation": "他们在实验之前计算了反应阻抗。" }
    ],
    "simple_future": [
      { "sentence": "We will analyze the reactances in the next phase of the project.", "translation": "我们将在项目的下一个阶段分析反应阻抗。" }
    ]
  },
  "phrases": {
    "examples": [
      { "phrase": "The total reactance", "translation": "总反应阻抗" },
      { "phrase": "Reactance in AC circuits", "translation": "交流电路中的反应阻抗" }
    ]
  }
}
