### Context of "Pretraining"

Pretraining is a crucial step in the fields of machine learning and natural language processing. It usually involves training a model on a vast array of data to equip it with foundational knowledge before it is fine-tuned for specific tasks. This approach helps enhance the model's accuracy and efficiency, as it learns general patterns and representations that can be adapted later.

Some common applications of pretraining include language models, image recognition systems, and any artificial intelligence applications where initial broad learning significantly impacts final performance.
