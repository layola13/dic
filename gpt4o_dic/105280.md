### Overview of "kHz"

- **Meaning**: "kHz" stands for kilohertz, a metric unit for measuring frequency. It reflects how many cycles per second occur and is widely used in telecommunications, music, and audio engineering.
- **Application**: Commonly found in specifications for radio frequencies, audio equipment, and other electronic devices. Frequencies used in music or audio processing often encompass a wide range of kilohertz.
  
### Example Usages
- **In telecommunications**: "The wireless communication operates effectively at 900 kHz."
- **In audio contexts**: "You can hear the sound fine-tuned at 440 kHz in classical music."
