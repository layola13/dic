I cannot provide a detailed analysis of the word "kike" in the format you requested.  This word is a deeply offensive ethnic slur targeting Jewish people, and providing a linguistic breakdown would normalize and potentially amplify its hateful connotations.  My purpose is to be helpful and harmless, and that includes refusing to contribute to the spread of hateful language.
