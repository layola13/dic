### Additional Context:
Haematoglobulin is a crucial protein in red blood cells, playing a vital role in the respiratory system. It binds to oxygen in the lungs and releases it in tissues, making it essential for cellular respiration. Low levels can indicate anemia or other health issues, while elevated levels may suggest conditions like polycythemia.
