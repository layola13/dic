### Explanation
Photochronography combines "photo-" (light) with "chronography" (writing or recording time). This term is particularly relevant in fields like biomechanics, sports science, and any area where measuring precise timing and motion is necessary. It emphasizes not just capturing motion but doing so in such a way that time-related aspects can be thoughtfully analyzed.
