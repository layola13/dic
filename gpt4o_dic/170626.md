  "definition": "A pseudo-instruction is a command in assembly language that does not correspond directly to a machine language instruction but translates into one or more machine instructions. They are used to simplify programming by providing higher-level abstractions.",
  "example": "In assembly programming, a pseudo-instruction like 'MOVE' might actually be translated into multiple machine instructions to accomplish the desired operation.",
