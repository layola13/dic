### Contextual Usage
"Despitous" is a somewhat archaic term that primarily conveys disdain and contempt. It can be applied in both formal and informal contexts but is particularly effective in literature or nuanced discussions where the tone and attitude of characters or speakers are being examined. 

### Note
The term is not widely used in modern English, which may limit its application in everyday conversation. Its synonyms (like "scornful" or "contemptuous") might be more familiar and easily understood in contemporary usage.
