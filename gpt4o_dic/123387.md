### Additional Context

**Taxonomic Classification**: Monomya is part of the bivalve class, which includes molluscs with two shells. However, unlike typical bivalves, monomyas have a single shell structure.

**Ecological Significance**: These organisms play a significant role in their marine ecosystems, often acting as indicators of environmental health due to their sensitivity to changes in water quality and sediment composition.

**Research Interest**: Scientists study monomyas for insights into the impacts of climate change and pollution on marine life, given their ecological roles and the threats they face.
