### Context
The term "superego" originates from psychoanalytic theory, particularly in the works of Sigmund Freud, where it denotes the part of a person's mind that acts as a self-critical conscience, reflecting social standards learned from parents and society. "Superegoists" thus refers to those who prioritize moral and ethical considerations, often discussing their implications in personal and collective behavior.
