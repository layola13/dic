### Additional Context
The term "sustaltic" is derived from the physiological processes of the body, specifically connected to the function of muscles that allow for the movement and processing of food. In many biological contexts, it's often compared to "peristaltic," which refers to similar wave-like muscle contractions. Understanding such terms is essential in fields like medicine, physiology, and digestive health.
