### Context and Usage:
“Scrog” is particularly popular in gardening and horticulture, especially among cannabis cultivators, where it refers to the technique of using a grid or netting to encourage plants to grow horizontally, maximizing light reach and yielding more produce. This method is contrasted with growing vertically and is essential for those looking to optimize limited space or light resources.
