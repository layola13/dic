I believe there's been a misunderstanding.  The provided JSON describes the English word "what," its grammatical functions, and various examples of its usage.  You asked for a similar analysis of the word "spathal," but I can't find any established word in standard English dictionaries or corpora with that spelling.


It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:** Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps a similar-sounding or related word exists.  If you can provide the intended word or context where you encountered "spathal," I might be able to help.

2. **It's a technical term or neologism:** It might be a word from a specific field (e.g., botany, medicine) or a newly coined word not yet widely recognized. If you can give me more context about where you saw the word, I might be able to identify it.

3. **It's a proper noun:**  Perhaps it's a name or place name with unique spelling.  Let me know if this is the case.


Please provide more information, and I'll do my best to give you the analysis you're looking for.
