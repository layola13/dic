### Additional Context
The term "rissoid" is often used within the fields of marine biology and paleontology. It identifies certain mollusks, specifically those belonging to the family Rissoidae. The shells are typically smooth and have minimal ornamentation, allowing them to blend into their environments more easily. This adaptation can be crucial for survival in their often hazardous deep-sea habitats.
