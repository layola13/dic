Here’s a detailed analysis of the English word “kelvins”:

{
  "word": "kelvins",
  "phonetics": "/ˈkɛlvɪnz/",
  "part_of_speech": "noun",
  "translation": "开尔文（温度单位）",
  "definition": "Kelvin is a unit of measurement for temperature, used in the physical sciences, defined as one of the base units in the International System of Units (SI).",
  "example": "The water boils at 373.15 kelvins.",
  "synonyms": ["K"],
  "antonyms": [],
  "usage": {
    "simple_present": [
      { "sentence": "Water freezes at 273.15 kelvins.", "translation": "水在273.15开尔文时冻结。" },
      { "sentence": "The temperature reached 300 kelvins today.", "translation": "今天气温达到了300开尔文。" }
    ],
    "present_continuous": [
      { "sentence": "The scientist is measuring the temperature in kelvins.", "translation": "科学家正在用开尔文测量温度。" },
      { "sentence": "They are adjusting the system to maintain 1000 kelvins.", "translation": "他们正在调整系统以保持1000开尔文。" }

      { "sentence": "Last night, the temperature dropped to 280 kelvins.", "translation": "昨晚的气温降到了280开尔文。" },
      { "sentence": "The experiment was conducted at 400 kelvins.", "translation": "实验是在400开尔文下进行的。" }
    ],
    "simple_future": [
      { "sentence": "Tomorrow, we will measure the temperature at 250 kelvins.", "translation": "明天我们将在250开尔文下测量温度。" },
      { "sentence": "The lab will operate at 300 kelvins next week.", "translation": "实验室下周将在300开尔文下运作。" }
    ]
  },
  "context": {
    "scientific_use": "Kelvins are vital in scientific contexts where precise temperature measurements are required, especially in fields like thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and cryogenics.",
    "conversion": "To convert Kelvin to Celsius, subtract 273.15. For Fahrenheit, the formula is (K - 273.15) × 9/5 + 32."
  },
  "additional_information": {
    "notable": "The Kelvin scale does not use the term 'degree'; it is simply referenced as 'kelvins'. It is an absolute temperature scale starting at absolute zero, where all molecular motion ceases.",
    "history": "Named after the Scottish physicist William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, who contributed significantly to thermodynamics."
