**Note:** "Unbangled" is not a commonly used word and might not be found in every dictionary. Its meaning can be derived from the prefix "un-" (not) and "bangled" (from "bangle," implying something that is often tangled or twisted). Thus, it suggests something that remains in that tangled or complicated state.
