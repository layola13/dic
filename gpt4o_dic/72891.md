### Contextual Understanding
In social media contexts, the term "followee" refers to someone that users choose to follow, receiving updates on their activities. This concept is crucial for interaction dynamics on platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, where user engagement often hinges on the content shared by followees. The concept contrasts with "follower," indicating the direction of the relationship—who follows whom—in the social media landscape.
