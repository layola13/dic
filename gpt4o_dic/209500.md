### Additional Context
"Subcardinally" is often used in mathematical contexts, particularly in set theory or statistics, where the concept of ranking or ordering is essential. This term contrasts with "cardinal," which refers to the counting numbers (e.g., one, two, three) as opposed to the order of those numbers. In everyday use, it may appear less frequently but is significant in disciplines that involve structured data analysis and ranking systems.
