### Explanation:
- **Word Origin**: "Nonreflectivenesses" is derived from the prefix "non-" indicating negation, combined with "reflectiveness," which relates to the property of reflecting light and images, and the suffix "ness" that forms nouns indicating a state or quality. The plural "nonreflectivenesses" indicates multiple states of lacking reflectivity.
- **Context**: Typically used in discussions about materials, design, art, or physics where the optical properties of surfaces are significant.
