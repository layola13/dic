### Additional Context:
Theriodonts are significant ancestors in the lineage leading to modern mammals, displaying features that hint at mammalian traits despite being part of a group of synapsids. They had advanced tooth differentiation which allowed them to occupy various ecological niches. The study of theriodonts helps paleontologists trace the evolution of mammals from reptilian origins.
