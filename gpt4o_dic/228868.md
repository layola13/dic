### Overview:
- **"Uncardinal"** describes numbers or systems that do not quantify something directly (like "1," "2," etc.), but instead indicate order or position (as in "first," "second," etc.).
- It's pertinent in both mathematics and linguistics, distinguishing between types of numerical representation.
