"Superbravenesses" is a largely informal or creative formation, combining "super" (extremely) with "braveness" (the quality of being brave) to emphasize an extraordinary level of courage. This term can be used in various contexts, especially when praising someone's remarkable ability to confront fears or dangerous situations. 

It's important to note that this form is rare in standard English and may primarily appear in creative writing or informal speech.
