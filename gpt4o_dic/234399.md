### Contextual Explanation:

**Unhistories** is a term often used in literary and philosophical contexts to highlight narratives that deviate from or challenge conventional accounts of history. This concept encourages exploration of underrepresented viewpoints, often focusing on marginalized or ignored groups and events. Such narratives can be important for understanding the complexities of history through alternative lenses, suggesting that history is not linear but rather a tapestry of diverse experiences and interpretations.
