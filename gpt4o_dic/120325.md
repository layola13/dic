### Context

**Minification** is a critical practice in web development and programming. It helps improve the performance of websites and applications by reducing file sizes, which can lead to faster loading times and reduced bandwidth usage. Minification typically applies to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, making them more efficient for browsers to process.
