It seems that "norseness" is not a recognized English word, and there are no established definitions, phonetics, or usage examples associated with it. It might be a misspelling or a very niche term not commonly found in English vocabulary.

If "norseness" is a specific term from a particular context, field, or jargon, please provide additional details or clarify its meaning, and I'd be happy to assist further!
