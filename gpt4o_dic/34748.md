### Additional Context:
- **"Clientest"** is not as commonly used as standard adjectives, so its application may be more specialized, primarily in business or service contexts, where customer service and client prioritization are emphasized.
- The term essentially elevates the concept of being client-focused to its highest degree, often used in marketing or client relations discussions.
