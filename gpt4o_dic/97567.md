### Context and Explanation

**Definition:** An "ingroup" refers to a group of individuals who share certain characteristics or identities that create a bond among them. This can be based on various factors like culture, religion, ethnicity, or shared interests.

Members of an ingroup often feel a sense of loyalty and connection, which can lead to positive or negative outcomes in social interactions, especially in contrast to outgroups.

**Usage Examples:**
- **Social Context:** "During the meeting, the ingroup members were more engaged than those from the outgroup."
- **Psychological Study:** "Research shows that ingroup members tend to underestimate the abilities of those from outgroups."
