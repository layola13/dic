### Contextual Explanation
"Monopteral" derives from the Greek roots "mono," meaning one, and "pteron," meaning wing or column. In architecture, this term is associated with structures that typically have a circular plan and are supported by a single central column, distinguishing them from more complex designs. These structures often served religious or commemorative purposes in ancient cultures, exemplifying a harmonious design that merges simplicity with grandeur.
