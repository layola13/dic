### Additional Context:

**Postmarking** serves an important role in mailing systems as it records the dispatch date for mail, which can be crucial for legal documents and other time-sensitive correspondence. This process enhances accountability and traceability in postal services. The specific design of a postmark can vary significantly based on location, postal service, and date, often making it a unique identifier for that particular instance of mailing.
