### Overview
The term "under-workman" refers to a worker who often engages in tasks that do not utilize their full skills, which can stem from various factors, including organizational structure or job allocation practices. Often seen in factory or manual labor settings, such roles can be necessary but may also lead to issues of job satisfaction and employee engagement if individuals find themselves consistently underutilized.
