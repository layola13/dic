I cannot find a word "upbear" in standard English dictionaries or corpora.  There is no established meaning or usage for this word.  Could you double-check the spelling or provide more context where you encountered this word?  Knowing the context might help me understand if it's a misspelling, a newly coined word, or a term from a specific field.
