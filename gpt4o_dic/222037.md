### Additional Context:
Tonquin is primarily associated with the tonka bean, known for its fragrant aroma and sweet flavor profile, which resembles vanilla and almond. In culinary contexts, it can be used sparingly to enhance desserts or savory dishes, although it's important to note that it contains coumarin, which can pose health risks if consumed in large amounts. Additionally, tonquin is valued in perfumery for its rich, sweet scent.
