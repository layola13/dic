I cannot provide a detailed analysis of the word "surds" in the same format as you provided for the word "what."  The structure you've used is specifically designed for interrogative words and their grammatical usage.  "Surd," while a word, functions differently and doesn't lend itself to the same type of analysis.

A "surd" is a mathematical term.  It refers to an irrational number that can be expressed as the root of an integer.  For example, √2, √3, and √5 are surds.  There's no tense, voice or other grammatical properties to analyze as with "what."

If you'd like information on surds, I can provide a definition, examples, and explain how they are used in mathematical operations.  Let me know what aspects of surds you'd like to understand better.
