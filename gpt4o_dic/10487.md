It seems like there might be a typo in the word you're asking about. The closest term in English is likely "applause." However, if you're looking for "appliment," it seems like it may not be an established English word. If you meant "applement," which refers to a type of tool or device related to application, I can guide you on that.

Here's a detailed analysis of "applause" instead:
