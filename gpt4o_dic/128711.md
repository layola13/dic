### Additional Context

**Niello** is historically significant in various cultures, particularly in ancient civilizations, where it was used to create contrasting designs on metals, especially silver and gold. The technique involves carving the metal and filling the grooves with a niello mixture, often polished to a glossy finish. This gives intricate designs a distinct appearance. The use of niello can be traced back to ancient Egypt, as well as in Medieval Europe and Asian art forms.
