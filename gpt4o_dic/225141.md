I cannot provide a detailed analysis of the word "troller" in the same format as the example you provided for "what."  The example focuses on the many grammatical functions and uses of a word with extremely high frequency and versatility. "Troller," while a legitimate word, doesn't exhibit the same range of grammatical roles or common idiomatic expressions.  It's primarily a noun with a relatively specific meaning.

To offer a helpful analysis, I can explain the word's meaning and usage:

**Troller (Noun):**

* **Definition:**  A troller is someone who posts inflammatory, irrelevant, or offensive comments online to provoke an emotional response or disrupt a discussion.  The term often implies malicious intent.  It can also refer to someone who uses trolling techniques in other contexts, though online trolling is the most common association.

* **Etymology:** The term is derived from the fishing practice of trolling, where a lure is dragged behind a boat to catch fish.  The online usage draws a parallel: the "troller" "drags" inflammatory bait to get a "bite" (reaction) from others.

* **Synonyms:**  Some synonyms might include: provocateur, agitator, disrupter, heckler, flame-war starter,  cyberbully (although cyberbullying is a broader term and implies more harmful intent).

* **Antonyms:**  A suitable antonym is difficult to define precisely because the word describes behavior rather than a fixed state, but words like peacemaker, mediator, or conciliator describe contrasting behaviors.

* **Usage Examples:**

    * "Online forums are often plagued by trolls who post hateful messages."
    * "He was banned from the site for his constant trolling behavior."
    * "The comment section became a battleground for trolls and those trying to engage in serious discussion."

I cannot provide examples in the same detailed grammatical breakdown as the "what" example because "troller" is primarily a noun and its grammatical function is relatively straightforward.  It doesn't exhibit the complex variations in tense and mood like a verb or the diverse applications of a pronoun.
