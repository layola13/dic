The word "unchiding" doesnâ€™t appear to be a standard English term, and I couldn't find a specific definition in recognized dictionaries. It's possible you may be referring to a less common word, a typo, or a neologism. 

If you could provide more context or check the spelling, I'd be glad to help further!
