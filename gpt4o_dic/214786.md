It seems that "surrebound" is not a standard word in English. It might be a misspelling, a neologism, or a specialized term from a specific field. If you meant to inquire about a different word or concept, please provide additional context, and I would be happy to assist! Alternatively, if it's a term related to a specific subject (like a particular industry, technology, or context), please clarify, and I can offer relevant information.
