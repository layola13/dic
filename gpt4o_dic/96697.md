### Additional Context:
"Ineffabilities" refers to concepts or experiences that are so profound or complex that they defy articulation. This term is often used in philosophical or poetic contexts to convey the limitations of language in expressing certain feelings or experiences. The word derives from "ineffable," which indicates something that cannot be easily explained or spoken about.
