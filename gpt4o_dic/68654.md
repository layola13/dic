### Context

The term "faradays" is often used in chemistry and physics, particularly in the study of electrochemistry. It refers to the quantification of electrical charge in terms of the amount of substance undergoing electrochemical reactions. The faraday unit is named after the British scientist Michael Faraday, known for his contributions to electromagnetism and electrochemistry.
