  "word": "nonmedullated",
  "phonetics": "/nɒn.məˈdʌ.leɪ.tɪd/",
  "part_of_speech": "adj.",
  "translation": "非髓鞘的",
  "definition": "Refers to nerve fibers that do not have a myelin sheath, leading to slower signal transmission compared to myelinated fibers.",
  "example": "Nonmedullated fibers are typically found in the autonomic nervous system.",
  "synonyms": ["unmyelinated"],
  "antonyms": ["myelinated"],
  "usage": {
    "context": [
      { "sentence": "Nonmedullated axons conduct impulses more slowly than myelinated axons.", "translation": "非髓鞘轴突的冲动传导速度比有髓鞘的轴突慢。" },
      { "sentence": "In the human body, nonmedullated fibers are often associated with pain transmission.", "translation": "在人体中，非髓鞘纤维通常与疼痛传导相关。" }

    "myelinated": {
      "definition": "Refers to nerve fibers that are coated with a myelin sheath, allowing for faster signal transmission.",
      "example": "Myelinated fibers are essential for rapid reflex actions."
    },
    "axon": {
      "definition": "The long, threadlike part of a nerve cell along which impulses are conducted from the cell body to other cells.",
      "example": "The axon transmits signals away from the neuron's cell body."
    }
