### Additional Information

- **Context of Use:** The term "amyelous" is particularly relevant in discussions of neurobiology or comparative anatomy, often in contexts involving invertebrates or certain types of vertebrates.
- **Implications:** Amyelous nerves are generally slower in transmitting impulses compared to myelinated ones, which can influence the behavior and reflexes of organisms.
