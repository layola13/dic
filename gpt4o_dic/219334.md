### Additional Context
"Thaneship" originates from Old English "þegn," which referred to a servant or follower, but it evolved during the medieval period to denote a noble warrior or landholder title in Anglo-Saxon society. Thanes were akin to modern barons or lords, holding lands granted by the king, indicating a hierarchical structure in governance and military service. The terms remain important in discussions of historical governance, feudal systems, and literary references, such as in Shakespeare's "Macbeth."
