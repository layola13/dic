### Context for **subglobularity**:
- Subglobularity is often used in fields such as geology, biology, and material sciences to describe the characteristics of particles, cells, or mineral forms.
- The term implies a deviation from perfect sphericity, indicating that while something may appear round, it is not perfectly so, which can be significant in studies related to aerodynamics, sedimentation, and biological functions.
