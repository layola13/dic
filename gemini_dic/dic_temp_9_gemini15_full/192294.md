词源:The word "screwdriver" is a compound word, combining "screw" and "driver."  "Screw," from Old English *scrū,  has Germanic roots and refers to a spiral fastening device. "Driver," from Old English *drīfan, meaning "to drive," is also of Germanic origin and refers to something that pushes or forces.  The combination thus logically describes the tool's function.
