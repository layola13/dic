词源:
From "prophecy" + "-ers" (plural noun suffix).  "Prophecy" comes from the Old French "profécie," ultimately from the Late Latin "prophetia," derived from the Greek "prophēteia" (prophecy), from "prophētēs" (prophet).  The root meaning relates to speaking forth or proclaiming something, often with divine inspiration.
