duchies:/ˈdʒuːkiːz/| n. |公国复数|The plural of duchy, referring to multiple territories ruled by a duke or duchess.|例句：Many historical accounts detail the struggles between neighboring duchies. 许多历史记载详细描述了邻近公国之间的斗争。|近义词：principalities, kingdoms (in some contexts)|反义词：empires (in some contexts)


USAGE->
This word is a noun and doesn't conjugate like verbs.  Therefore, grammatical tenses like present, past, future, etc. don't apply.  The word itself describes a state of being (multiple duchies existing).  Grammatical variations would apply to sentences *using* the word, not to the word itself.


Example sentence with different grammatical structures:


Simple Present: The map shows the locations of several powerful duchies.  地图显示了几个强大公国的地理位置。

Simple Past:  Three powerful duchies fought over the disputed territory. 三个强大的公国为了有争议的领土而战。

Future Tense: Historians predict the rise of new duchies in the coming century. 历史学家预测未来一个世纪将会出现新的公国。

Passive Voice: The borders of the duchies were redrawn after the war. 战争结束后，公国的边界被重新划定。


PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases directly using "duchies" as a central element, as it's a more specific geographical/political term.  Phrases would typically involve other words describing the action or state of duchies.  Examples could be:

a confederation of duchies 公国联盟
the decline of the duchies 公国的衰落
the unification of the duchies 公国的统一
the rulers of the duchies 公国的统治者
the history of the duchies 公国的历史
