词源:

The term "fail-safe" is a compound word.  "Fail" comes from the Old English *fælan, meaning "to deceive, trick, betray" and later evolving to mean "to be unsuccessful". "Safe" originates from Old English *sæf, meaning "safe, unharmed, secure."  The combination suggests a system designed to remain safe even if other parts fail.
