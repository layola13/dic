词源:
The word "decommissioned" is formed from the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse") and the verb "commissioned."  "Commissioned" means "officially put into service," so "decommissioned" means "officially removed from service."  The root is ultimately linked to the Latin word "committere," meaning "to entrust" or "to commit."
