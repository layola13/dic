词源:
The word "semi-retired" is a compound word.  "Semi-" is a prefix derived from Latin *semi-, meaning "half" or "partly."  "Retired" comes from the verb "retire," ultimately from Old French *retirer, meaning "to withdraw."  Therefore, "semi-retired" literally means "partly withdrawn" from full-time work.
