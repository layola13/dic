/ʃɛərbiːm/| n. |共享光束，共享波束|A sharebeam is a technology that allows multiple users to share a single beam of light or other type of radiation, typically for communication or sensing purposes.  It is often used in contexts like optical communication networks or sensor networks where multiple devices need to access the same resource efficiently.  The exact implementation varies depending on the application.|Example: The researchers developed a novel sharebeam system for high-bandwidth optical communication.|近义词：shared beam, collaborative beam|反义词：N/A
