The word "pan-roman" does not exist as a standard English word with a recognized entry in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  The term appears to be a combination of "pan-" (meaning "all," "entire," or "every") and "Roman" (referring to Rome or the Roman Empire).  It might be used informally or in a specialized context to describe something encompassing all things Roman, or perhaps a system or philosophy incorporating elements from across the entire Roman world.

To illustrate the formatting, let's use the constituent parts instead:


pan- /pæn/ | prefix | 全，泛 |  A prefix meaning "all," "every," or "entire," often used to create words encompassing a wide range of things. | Pan-European, pan-African | anti- | prefix


Roman /ˈroʊmən/ | adj., n. | 罗马的；罗马人 | Relating to ancient Rome, its people, culture, or language. | The Roman Empire, Roman numerals. | Greek, Hellenic | Barbarian (in a historical context) | adj., n.


If someone were to use "pan-Roman," it would need to be defined within the context where it's used.  It's not a word with established meaning or usage.  To provide the requested grammatical examples etc. requires a word that actually exists.
