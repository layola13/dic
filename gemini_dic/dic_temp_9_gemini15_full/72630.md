词源:  The word "flyleaf" is a compound word.  "Fly" in this context doesn't refer to an insect, but rather to something loose or unbound.  It likely comes from the Old English word "fleogan," meaning "to fly,"  referring to the loose, unbound nature of these pages. "Leaf" refers to a single sheet of paper.  Thus, "flyleaf" describes a loose, unbound leaf of paper.
