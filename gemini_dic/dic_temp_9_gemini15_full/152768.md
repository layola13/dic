词源:

The word "peccadillo" comes from the Spanish word "pecadillo," a diminutive of "pecado," meaning "sin."  The Spanish word itself derives from the Latin word "peccatum," meaning "sin" or "fault."  Thus, the word's history traces back to the concept of sin in a religious context, although its modern usage is often much less serious.


用法说明:

Peccadillos are typically minor transgressions, not major crimes or moral failings. They are often viewed with a degree of amusement or indulgence rather than condemnation.  The plural form, "peccadillos," is more commonly used than the singular.  The word often implies a sense of charming imperfection or slight naughtiness.
