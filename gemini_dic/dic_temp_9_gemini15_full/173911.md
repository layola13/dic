词源:
"Quasi" is from Latin, meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."  "Ridiculously" is derived from "ridiculous," which comes from the late Middle English word "ridicule" and ultimately from Latin "rīdiculus," meaning "laughable" or "worthy of laughter." Therefore, "quasi-ridiculously" means "almost laughably" or "nearly absurdly."
