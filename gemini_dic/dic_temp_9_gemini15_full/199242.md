词源:  The word "silo" originally refers to a tall cylindrical structure for storing grain.  The metaphorical use of "silo" to describe isolated departments or teams within an organization developed later, reflecting the idea that these groups operate independently and without sufficient communication.  "Busting" means breaking something open or destroying it. Therefore, "silo-busting" means breaking down the barriers and isolation of these "silos."
