PHRASE->
(Adverbs rarely form set phrases.  The meaning of "semisomnolently" is contained within the word itself.)
N/A

词源:
The word is a combination of:

* **semi-**: A prefix meaning "half" or "partially."
* **somnolent**: An adjective meaning "sleepy" or "drowsy."  This comes from the Latin word *somnolentus*, derived from *somnus* (sleep).
* **-ly**: An adverbial suffix.

Therefore, "semisomnolently" literally means "in a half-sleepy manner."
