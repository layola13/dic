The word "forewite" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or related word.  Could you double-check the spelling or provide more context?
* **It's an archaic or obsolete word:**  Some words fall out of common usage. If this is the case, finding information would require specialized historical dictionaries.
* **It's a neologism or made-up word:**  The word might have been coined recently or is specific to a particular context (e.g., a fictional work).

To help me provide the analysis you need, please clarify the word or provide more information about where you encountered it.
