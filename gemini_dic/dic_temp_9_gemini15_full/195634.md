semireflex:/ˌsɛmiˈriːflɛks/| adj.|半反身的，半反射的|Partially reflexive; reflecting or bending back only partially.|The semireflexive pronoun in this sentence is confusing.|近义词：partially reflexive|反义词：fully reflexive, completely reflective


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in linguistics and doesn't have typical tense variations like "What is your name?".  Therefore, providing examples for different tenses is not applicable.  Instead, I'll illustrate its usage in linguistic contexts.


Example 1:
The pronoun "myself" can function as a semireflexive pronoun in certain constructions. =  代词“myself”在某些结构中可以充当半反身代词。


Example 2:
Some linguists argue that certain reciprocal pronouns exhibit semireflexive properties. = 一些语言学家认为某些相互代词表现出半反身特性。


Example 3 (Illustrating the contrast with fully reflexive):
While "I washed myself" is fully reflexive, "I hurt myself" can be interpreted as semireflexive if the hurt was accidental, rather than self-inflicted. =  虽然“我洗了澡”是完全反身的，但如果受伤是意外的，而不是自我造成的，“我伤了自己”可以解释为半反身的。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "semireflexive".  Its use is highly specialized within linguistic analysis.
