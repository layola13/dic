pseudomorph:/ˈsuːdəmɔːrf/| n. |假象形, 假晶|A pseudomorph is a mineral that has replaced another mineral, but has retained the original mineral's shape.  It's a mineral with the external form of a different mineral.  The original mineral's structure and chemical composition have been completely replaced by a new mineral, leaving only the original shape behind.|Example:  A quartz pseudomorph after calcite means that a calcite crystal was originally present, but it has been completely replaced by quartz, while maintaining its original calcite crystal shape.|近义词:replacement mineral|反义词:  (No direct antonym, as it describes a specific geological process.)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
This rock is a pseudomorph. = 这块石头是假象形。
That mineral displays pseudomorphic features. = 那矿物展现出假象形的特征。


一般过去时:
The calcite was replaced, forming a pseudomorph. = 方解石被替换，形成了假象形。
Geologists studied the pseudomorph. = 地质学家研究了这个假象形。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered many pseudomorphs. = 科学家们已经发现了许多假象形。
We have analyzed the pseudomorph's composition. = 我们已经分析了假象形的成分。


过去完成时:
The original mineral had already been replaced before we examined it. = 在我们检查它之前，原始矿物已经被替换了。
The process had completed, leaving behind a perfect pseudomorph. = 过程已经完成，留下一个完美的假象形。


将来时:
We will study more pseudomorphs next year. = 我们明年将研究更多假象形。
Researchers will analyze the pseudomorph's structure. = 研究人员将分析假象形的结构。


虚拟语气:
If the conditions were different, a pseudomorph wouldn't have formed. = 如果条件不同，就不会形成假象形。
I wish I had more time to study this pseudomorph. = 我希望我有更多时间来研究这个假象形。


被动语态:
The pseudomorph was formed by replacement. = 假象形是通过置换形成的。
The sample is being analyzed to determine if it is a pseudomorph. = 正在分析样品以确定它是否为假象形。


疑问句:
Is this a pseudomorph? = 这是假象形吗？
What type of mineral formed this pseudomorph? = 什么类型的矿物形成了这个假象形？


否定句:
This is not a pseudomorph; it's a genuine crystal. = 这不是假象形；这是一个真正的晶体。
The rock doesn't exhibit pseudomorphic characteristics. = 这块石头没有表现出假象形的特征。


PHRASE->
pseudomorph after calcite = 方解石假象形
pseudomorph after pyrite = 黄铁矿假象形
pseudomorphic replacement = 假象形置换
pseudomorph of quartz = 石英假象形
formation of pseudomorphs = 假象形的形成
