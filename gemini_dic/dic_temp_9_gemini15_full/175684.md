词源:
The word "rape" ultimately derives from the Old French word "raper," meaning "to seize," "to snatch," or "to carry off."  This in turn has roots in the Latin word "rapere,"  with the same general meaning of seizing or taking by force.  The modern understanding of "rape" as specifically sexual violence evolved over time from the broader original meaning.
