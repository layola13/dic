The word "palilogy" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis following the requested format.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure field.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer some assistance.
