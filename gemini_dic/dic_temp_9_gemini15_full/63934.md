epipolic:/ˌɛpɪˈpɒlɪk/| adj.|表面的，肤浅的；附带的 | Relating to or denoting the surface of a liquid or other substance.  Often used in scientific contexts, particularly in relation to the reflection or scattering of light from a surface. | Example: The epipolic scattering of light from the water surface was measured.  水面上的光表层散射被测量了。|近义词：superficial, surface, incidental |反义词：deep, profound, intrinsic


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The epipolic layer reflects light differently. = 表层反射光线的方式不同。
This phenomenon is epipolic in nature. = 这种现象本质上是表层的。


一般过去时:
The scientists studied the epipolic scattering. = 科学家们研究了表层散射。
The experiment showed epipolic effects. = 实验显示了表层效应。


现在完成时:
Researchers have observed epipolic fluorescence. = 研究人员已经观察到表层荧光。
We have analyzed the epipolic properties of the solution. = 我们已经分析了该溶液的表层特性。


过去完成时:
They had already measured the epipolic response before the presentation. = 他们在演示之前已经测量了表层响应。
The team had investigated the epipolic behavior of the material. = 该团队已经调查了该材料的表层行为。


将来时:
We will examine the epipolic layer more closely. = 我们将更仔细地检查表层。
The study will focus on epipolic effects in different media. = 该研究将关注不同介质中的表层效应。


虚拟语气:
If the scattering were purely epipolic, the results would be different. = 如果散射完全是表层的，结果就会不同。
I wish the data showed a clearer epipolic signature. = 我希望数据显示更清晰的表层特征。


被动语态:
The epipolic properties were carefully analyzed. = 表层特性被仔细分析。
The epipolic scattering was measured using a specialized instrument. = 表层散射是用专用仪器测量的。


疑问句:
Is this effect solely epipolic in origin? = 这种效应仅仅源于表层吗？
What are the factors influencing the epipolic scattering? = 影响表层散射的因素有哪些？


否定句:
The results were not consistent with a purely epipolic explanation. = 结果与纯粹的表层解释不一致。
The phenomenon is not simply epipolic; other factors are involved. = 这种现象不仅仅是表层的；还涉及其他因素。
