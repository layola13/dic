polyphyletic:/ˌpɒlifaɪˈlɛtɪk/| adj. |并系的；多源的|  relating to a group of organisms derived from more than one common ancestor, thus not representing a true clade.  A polyphyletic group is artificial in that it does not accurately reflect evolutionary relationships.  This is in contrast to monophyletic groups, which include a common ancestor and all its descendants. | Example:  The grouping of "warm-blooded animals" is polyphyletic because it includes birds and mammals, which have different evolutionary origins.  The grouping of warm-blooded animals is polyphyletic because it includes birds and mammals, which evolved from different ancestors. | 近义词:artificial, heterogeneous | 反义词:monophyletic
