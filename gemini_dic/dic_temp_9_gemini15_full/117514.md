The word "meenan" is not a word found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information for it. It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name, place, or brand name.
* **It's a word from a dialect or a very niche vocabulary:**  It might be a word used in a specific region or community.
* **It's a newly coined word:** It might be a neologism not yet included in dictionaries.


If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, what it was referring to), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
