词源：
From Middle English *foreordenen, from Old English *for- + *ordenen ("to ordain").  The prefix "fore-" indicates something happening before, and "ordain" itself has roots tracing back to Old French and Latin, ultimately relating to concepts of ordering, arranging, or decreeing.  The sense of divine decree is a strong element in the word's historical usage.
