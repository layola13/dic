词源:  The phrase likely originated from the idea of a quick, unexpected move, like a quick draw in a card game or a sudden, unexpected action. "Fast" here means quick and sly, not necessarily speedy in the literal sense. The "one" refers to the trick or deception itself.  The exact origin is difficult to pinpoint, but its usage reflects a long-standing understanding of deceptive practices.
