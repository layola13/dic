词源:The term "has-been" is a compound of "has" and "been," suggesting someone who *has been* successful or famous but is no longer.  Its origin is unclear, but it emerged in the early 20th century and gained popularity in the mid-20th century, likely reflecting a growing interest in celebrity culture and the ephemerality of fame.  The structure is similar to other informal compound words expressing a state of being.
