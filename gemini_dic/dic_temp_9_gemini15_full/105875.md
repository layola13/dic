词源:

The word "kitsch" is believed to have originated in 19th-century Munich, Germany.  Its exact etymology is uncertain, but it is commonly thought to derive from the German word "kitzen," meaning "to paint," or possibly from a Bavarian dialect word related to painting or sketching.  Its meaning evolved to describe cheaply made, mass-produced items appealing to the masses.  The word made its way into English in the 20th century and quickly gained popularity as a descriptor of artistic and aesthetic choices deemed to be in poor taste.
