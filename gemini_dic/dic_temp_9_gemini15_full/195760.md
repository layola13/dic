WORD ORIGIN->

The word "semitruthfulness" is a combination of:

* **semi-**:  A prefix meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."  Derived from Latin.
* **truthfulness**:  The quality or state of being truthful.  Combines "truth" (Old English) and "-fulness" (a suffix indicating a state or quality).


Therefore, "semitruthfulness" literally means "half-truthfulness" or a state of being partly truthful.
