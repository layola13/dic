USAGE->
This word is an adverb, and its usage is limited due to its rarity and somewhat awkward construction.  It describes something that lacks variation or diversity.  It doesn't naturally fit into common grammatical tenses like the examples provided for "what" because it's not a common word.  Therefore, illustrative examples focusing on different tenses are not practical.


例句1: The machine operated nonvariously, producing identical outputs every time. = 机器运行一致，每次都产生相同的输出。

例句2:  The students answered the question nonvariously, all choosing the same option. = 学生们对这个问题的回答出奇一致，都选择了相同的选项。


PHRASE->
