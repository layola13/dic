preextensive: /priːɪkˈstɛnsɪv/ | adj. | 预先广泛的，预先广泛性的 |  This word is not a standard English word. It appears to be a combination of "pre-" (before) and "extensive" (covering a large area or many things).  Therefore, it would suggest something that is widely spread or encompassing *before* a particular event or point in time.  There is no established definition or usage in standard dictionaries.  It might be used in a specialized field or coined for a specific context.  Due to its non-standard nature, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms and grammatical usage is not possible.  It would need a specific context to define its meaning appropriately.
