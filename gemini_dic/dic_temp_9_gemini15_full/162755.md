prebestowals:/ˌpriːbɪˈstoʊəl/| n. |预先给予；预先赠与 |The word "prebestowals" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") with "bestowals" (the plural of "bestowal," meaning the act of giving something as a gift or grant).  Therefore, it would mean "things given in advance" or "prior grants."  There are no established examples of its usage in dictionaries or corpora.  Its meaning can only be inferred from its constituent parts. |There are no standard examples as this is not a real word. A possible example, based on its inferred meaning, would be:  "The prebestowals of land rights were crucial to the colony's early development." = 土地权利的预先授予对殖民地的早期发展至关重要。 |近义词:  advance grants, prior gifts, pre-allocations |反义词:  post-bestowals, later gifts, subsequent grants |名词
