castability:/ˌkæstəˈbɪləti/| n. |可铸性，可浇铸性 |The ability of a material to be cast into a mold.  This property depends on factors such as fluidity, solidification rate, and shrinkage.  A material with high castability is easy to pour and fill the mold completely with minimal defects. | The high castability of aluminum alloys makes them ideal for complex shapes.  铝合金的高可铸性使其成为复杂形状的理想选择。 The poor castability of this steel limited its use in the project.  这种钢的可铸性差限制了其在该项目中的应用。 |  moldability, fluidity | brittleness, fragility
