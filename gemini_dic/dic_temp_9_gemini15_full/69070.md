词源:
The word "faultlessly" is derived from the word "fault," meaning an imperfection or defect.  The suffix "-less" means "without," and the suffix "-ly" indicates an adverbial form, modifying a verb or adjective.  Therefore, "faultlessly" signifies "without fault" or "perfectly."  The word's history traces back to Old French and ultimately to Latin roots related to the idea of "failing" or "being deficient."
