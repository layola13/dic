词源:

From Old French *discret, from Latin discretus, past participle of discernere "to separate, distinguish," from dis- "apart" + cernere "to separate, distinguish."  The sense evolution is from "separate, distinct" to "circumspect, careful" reflecting a connection between discernment and careful consideration of one's actions.
