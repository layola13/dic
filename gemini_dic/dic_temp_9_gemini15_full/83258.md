gymnocytode:/ˌdʒɪmˈnɑːsətoʊd/ | n. |裸细胞体，拟细胞 | A gymnocytode is a small, naked cell-like structure found in some organisms, particularly in certain algae and fungi.  It lacks a distinct cell wall and often exhibits amoeboid movement.  It's considered a stage in the life cycle or a reproductive structure, its exact function varying depending on the species. The term highlights its resemblance to a cell ("cytode") but emphasizes the absence of a typical cell wall ("gymn-"). | Example: The research paper detailed the morphology and behavior of gymnocytodes observed in the *Chlamydomonas* species.  该研究论文详细介绍了在衣藻属物种中观察到的裸细胞体的形态和行为。 | 近义词: (There aren't direct synonyms, as it's a specific biological term.  Related terms might include:)  protoplast, cell, spore | 反义词: (The opposite would be a cell with a defined wall:)  walled cell
