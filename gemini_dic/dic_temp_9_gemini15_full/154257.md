词源:
The word "perishables" is derived from the verb "perish," meaning to be destroyed or die.  "Perish" ultimately comes from the Old French "perir" and the Latin "perire," meaning "to go to ruin," "to be lost," or "to die." The "-able" suffix transforms the verb into an adjective, meaning "capable of being perished," and the addition of "-s" creates the noun form referring to things that are perishable.
