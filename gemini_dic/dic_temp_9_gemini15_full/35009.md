词源:
The word "clone" originates from the Greek word "klōn," meaning "twig" or "slip."  In horticulture, a "clone" was a plant propagated from a cutting or other vegetative part, thus creating a genetically identical copy. The scientific use of the term broadened to encompass any genetically identical copy, including animals and cells.
