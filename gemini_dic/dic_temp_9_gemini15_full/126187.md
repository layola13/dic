词源:

The word "muzzinesses" is derived from the adjective "muzzy," which itself has uncertain origins.  One likely source is an onomatopoeic origin, suggesting a sound associated with indistinctness or confusion. Another possible etymology links it to the Old English word "mūsian," meaning "to be dazed or confused," although this connection is not definitively established.  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "muzzy" into the noun "muzziness," indicating a state or quality.  The addition of "-es" creates the plural form "muzzinesses."
