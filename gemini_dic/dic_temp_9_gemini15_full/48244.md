词源：

The word "decontrolling" is formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse") to the word "controlling."  "Controlling" comes from the verb "control," ultimately deriving from Old French "controller" (to check, verify), itself from Medieval Latin "contrarotulare" (to counter-roll, check against a duplicate roll).
