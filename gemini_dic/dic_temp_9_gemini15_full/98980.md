inter-sampling:/ˌɪntərˈsæmpliŋ/ | n. |样本间采样，内插采样|The process of estimating values between known data points in a sample.  This is often used in signal processing to reconstruct a continuous signal from discrete samples.  For example, in image processing, inter-sampling might be used to increase the resolution of an image by creating new pixel values between existing ones. |Example:  Inter-sampling techniques are crucial for upscaling images without significant loss of quality. = 样本间采样技术对于在不显著损失质量的情况下放大图像至关重要。


The effectiveness of the inter-sampling algorithm depends heavily on the nature of the original signal. = 样本间采样算法的有效性很大程度上取决于原始信号的性质。|近义词：interpolation, resampling |反义词：downsampling
