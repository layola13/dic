retaxations:/ˌriːtækˈseɪʃənz/ | n. | 再征税；重新减税 |  The word "retaxations" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It's likely a newly coined word or a misspelling.  It seems to combine "re-" (again) and "taxations" (the act of taxing).  Therefore, it could potentially refer to the act of taxing something again or the process of re-evaluating and adjusting taxes.  However, without context, its meaning remains ambiguous. | Example: (Hypothetical)  The government announced new retaxations on luxury goods to fund infrastructure projects.  政府宣布对奢侈品再次征税以资助基础设施项目。 |近义词: re-taxation,  double taxation (if referring to taxing twice)|反义词: tax reduction, tax exemption |
