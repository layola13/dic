词源:
The word "forecastle" comes from the Middle English "fore castel," meaning "forward castle."  The "castel" part refers to the fortified structure at the front of a medieval ship, providing a protected area for crew and weapons.  The "fore" simply indicates its location at the front of the vessel.  This etymology demonstrates the historical evolution of naval architecture, where the forecastle served a defensive and functional purpose.
