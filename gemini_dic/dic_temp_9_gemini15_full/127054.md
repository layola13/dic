词源:

The word "nasutness" is derived from the adjective "nasute," meaning having a large nose.  "Nasute" itself comes from the Latin word "nasutus," which combines "nasus" (nose) and the suffix "-utus," indicating possession of a quality.  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, indicating a state or quality.  While the original meaning refers to a large nose, the word's usage has evolved to encompass the broader sense of untidiness or sloppiness often associated with someone possessing a large nose.
