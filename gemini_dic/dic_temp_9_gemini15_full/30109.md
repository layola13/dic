The word "cecutiency" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries like Merriam-Webster, Oxford English Dictionary, or Cambridge Dictionary.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and the other requested information.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized field not widely known.
