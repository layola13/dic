词源:

The word "cussednesses" derives from "cussed," an archaic and dialectal variant of "cursed."  "Cursed" in this context doesn't necessarily imply divine punishment, but rather signifies something troublesome, difficult, or ill-tempered.  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "cussed" into a noun, signifying the quality or state of being cussed.  The plural "-es" indicates multiple instances of this quality.


用法说明:

"Cussednesses" is a relatively uncommon word, primarily found in informal contexts.  It's used to describe multiple instances or aspects of stubbornness, obstinacy, or ill temper. The word carries a strong connotation of negativity and frustration.
