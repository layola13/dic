词源:
The word "imperatively" derives from the adjective "imperative," which comes from the Latin word "imperativus," meaning "commanding" or "relating to a command."  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb, modifying verbs and describing how an action is performed.

用法说明:

The adverb "imperatively" indicates that something is done or said in a forceful, commanding, or urgent manner.  It suggests a sense of necessity or urgency. It's often used to describe the tone or manner of speech or action rather than the action itself.

例句：

1. The general spoke imperatively to his troops. 将军命令他的军队。

2. The situation demanded that we act imperatively.  形势要求我们必须采取行动。

3.  The instructions were given imperatively, leaving no room for discussion. 指令是命令式的，不容讨论。

4. She imperatively dismissed his concerns. 她断然驳回了他的担忧。

5. He looked at her imperatively, expecting immediate obedience. 他命令地看着她，期待立即服从。


注意：由于“imperatively”本身是一个副词，它没有时态变化。  它修饰动词，描述动词的行为方式。  因此，不需要像例句中“What”的分析那样，按时态、语态等进行分类。
