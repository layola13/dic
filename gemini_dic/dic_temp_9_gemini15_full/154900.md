The word "pesanted" is not a recognized word in standard English.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a neologism: A newly coined word not yet widely accepted.
* It's a word from a specific dialect or jargon:  If so, please provide context.
* It's a proper noun:  If it's a name or place, please specify.


Please provide more information or correct the spelling so I can assist you.
