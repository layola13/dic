词源:  From Late Latin *pontificalis, from Latin pontifex "pontiff," literally "bridge-maker," from *pōns "bridge" + *facere "to make."  The original meaning referred to the high priest's role in bridging the gap between the human and divine realms.  Over time, the term became associated specifically with the Pope.


用法说明:

The word "pontifical" can be used in two main ways:

1. **Relating to the Pope or the papacy:** This is the primary and most common usage.  It describes things that are associated with the office of the Pope, such as ceremonies, pronouncements, or decrees.

2. **Pompous or arrogant:** This is a secondary usage, stemming from the association of papal authority with a sense of grandiosity and self-importance.  When used in this way, "pontifical" implies an excessive display of authority or a superior attitude.


例句:

1.  The pontifical mass was a spectacular display of religious pageantry.  教皇弥撒是宗教盛况的壮丽展示。
