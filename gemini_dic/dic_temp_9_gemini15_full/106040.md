词源:

The term "knee-jerk" originates from the physiological reflex of the knee, where a tap below the kneecap causes the lower leg to involuntarily kick out.  The metaphorical extension to describe impulsive, unthinking reactions emerged later, borrowing from the automatic nature of the physical reflex.
