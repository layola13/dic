nonphonemic: /ˌnɒnfoʊˈniːmɪk/ | adj. | 非语音的，非音位的 |  Relating to or denoting a difference in pronunciation that does not distinguish one word from another.  It refers to variations in pronunciation that do not change the meaning of a word.  For example, the aspirated and unaspirated versions of /p/ in English are nonphonemic.  | The subtle differences in pronunciation between the two speakers were nonphonemic.  两个说话者细微的语音差异是非音位的。


The aspirated /p/ in "pin" and the unaspirated /p/ in "spin" are nonphonemic variations in English.  "pin" 和 "spin" 中的送气 /p/ 和不送气 /p/ 是英语中的非音位变体。
