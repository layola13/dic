The word "prame" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Perhaps "frame," "prime," "pre-eminent," or another word entirely?  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name (person, place, or thing) specific to a certain field or region.  More context is needed.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:**  It could be a newly coined word, jargon within a specific community, or slang not yet widely recognized.  Again, more context is required.


Without knowing the intended word, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical explanations as requested in your format.  Please provide the correct spelling or more context.
