词源:
The word "hungover" is derived from the earlier word "hangover," which first appeared in the late 19th century.  The "hang" element likely refers to the lingering, unpleasant effects of alcohol,  "hanging" on after the drinking has ceased.  The "-over" suffix indicates a remaining or continuing state.
