词源:
The word "interlacement" comes from the Old French "entrelacement,"  itself a combination of "entre" (between) and "lacement" (lacing, interweaving).  The prefix "inter-" indicates a mutual or reciprocal action between elements, while "-lacement" derives from the verb "lacer," meaning to lace or interweave.  Therefore, the word's etymology clearly points to its meaning of things being intertwined or interwoven.
