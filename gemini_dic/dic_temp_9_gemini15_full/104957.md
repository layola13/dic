kelvin-scale:/ˈkɛlvɪn skeɪl/| n. |开尔文温标|The Kelvin scale is an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale where zero is absolute zero, the theoretical absence of all thermal energy.  It's used extensively in science and engineering, particularly in fields like physics and chemistry.  The unit of measurement is the kelvin (K).|The boiling point of water at standard atmospheric pressure is approximately 373.15 K.|近义词：absolute temperature scale|反义词：Celsius scale, Fahrenheit scale
