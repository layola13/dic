merenchyma: /mɛrˈɛŋkɪmə/ | n. | 薄壁组织 |  Merenchyma refers to a type of plant tissue composed of thin-walled cells, typically found in the cortex and pith of stems and roots. These cells are involved in storage, photosynthesis, and other metabolic processes.  The cells are usually isodiametric (roughly equal in all dimensions) and lack secondary thickenings in their cell walls. | Example: The merenchyma of the potato tuber stores starch.  马铃薯块茎的薄壁组织储存淀粉。 | 近义词: parenchyma (more general term for thin-walled tissue) | 反义词: sclerenchyma (thick-walled tissue) | 名词
