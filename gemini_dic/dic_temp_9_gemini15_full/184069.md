resignaling:/ˌriːˈsɪɡnəlɪŋ/| n. |重新信号传输，再信号化|The process of retransmitting a signal, often to improve reliability or reach a wider audience.  It can also refer to the process of re-establishing a signal after an interruption.  Resignaling is crucial in telecommunications and network systems to ensure smooth data transmission. | Example: The network experienced a brief outage, but automatic resignaling restored connectivity within seconds. = 网络短暂中断，但自动重新信号传输在几秒钟内恢复了连接。 The resignaling process ensured all participants received the message. = 重新信号传输过程确保所有参与者都收到了消息。|近义词：retransmission, rebroadcasting|反义词：signal termination, signal loss|名词
