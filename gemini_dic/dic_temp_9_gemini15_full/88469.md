histolysis:/hɪˈstɒləsɪs/| n. |组织溶解；细胞溶解|The enzymatic breakdown of tissues.  This process is crucial in various biological contexts, such as the remodeling of tissues during development or the removal of damaged cells. Histolysis can be a normal physiological process or a pathological one, depending on the context.|Example: The histolysis of the tadpole tail during metamorphosis is a remarkable example of programmed cell death.  蝌蚪在变态过程中尾部的组织溶解是程序性细胞死亡的一个显著例子。|近义词：tissue degradation, cell death, cytolysis |反义词：histopoiesis, tissue regeneration


USAGE->
