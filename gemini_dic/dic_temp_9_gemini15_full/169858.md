prosencephalon:/ˌprɒsɛnˈsɛfəlɒn/| n. |前脑 |The prosencephalon is the anterior-most part of the developing vertebrate brain, which eventually differentiates into the telencephalon and diencephalon.  It is responsible for higher-level cognitive functions, sensory processing, and motor control.|Example:  The development of the prosencephalon is crucial for the formation of the cerebral cortex and other important brain structures.  前脑的发育对于大脑皮层的形成和其他重要大脑结构的形成至关重要。|近义词：forebrain |反义词： 无
