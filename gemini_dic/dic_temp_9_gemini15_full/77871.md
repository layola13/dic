词源:
The word "geneticist" is a relatively modern word, derived from the word "genetics," which in turn comes from "gene."  "Gene" itself is a shortened form of "gene" (the fundamental unit of heredity) and the suffix "-ist" denotes a person who specializes in a particular field.  The root traces back to the work of Gregor Mendel and the development of the field of genetics in the early 20th century.
