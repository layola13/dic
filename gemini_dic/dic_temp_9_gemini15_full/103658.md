词源:
The word "jolly" in this context derives from an earlier meaning of the word, meaning "happy," "merry," or "cheerful." This sense is related to the Old French word *joli*, meaning "pretty," "fine," or "handsome." Over time, the meaning shifted to encompass the act of making someone happy or cheerful.  The use of "jolly" to mean "to trick or deceive playfully" is a later development, likely stemming from the idea of using cheerful demeanor to mislead.
