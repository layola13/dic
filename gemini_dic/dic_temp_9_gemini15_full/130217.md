词源:

The word "non-sensual" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "sensual."  "Sensual" derives from the Latin word "sensualis," which itself comes from "sensus," meaning "sense" or "feeling."  Thus, the word's etymology traces back to the concept of sensory experience and physical feelings.
