The word "prain" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Perhaps "pray," "rain," "plain," "prune," or another word?  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **It's a regional dialect word:**  It might be a word used in a specific geographic location or within a particular community.  If you can provide context (where you encountered the word), it might help identify its meaning.

3. **It's a newly coined word or a proper noun:**  It could be a very recent invention or a name (perhaps of a person or place).
