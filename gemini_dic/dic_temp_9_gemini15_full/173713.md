词源:
The word is a combination of "quasi" (Latin, meaning "as if," "seemingly," or "almost") and "miserably" (from "miserable," Old French *miserable, from Latin miserabilis, from miser "wretched").  It's a relatively modern coinage, reflecting the increasing use of "quasi-" as a prefix to modify adjectives and create nuanced meanings.
