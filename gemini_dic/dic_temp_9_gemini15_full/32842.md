词源：The word "choleraic" comes from the Greek word "cholē" (χολή), meaning "bile" or "gall."  Ancient Greek medicine believed that the body contained four humors: blood, phlegm, yellow bile (choler), and black bile.  An excess of yellow bile was thought to cause anger and irritability, hence the association of "choleraic" with a bad temper.  The word entered English through Latin "cholericus".
