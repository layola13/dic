The word "hatan" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It might be:

1. A misspelling of an existing word.  If you can provide the intended word, I can provide the analysis.
2. A word from a different language. If you can specify the language, I might be able to provide a translation and explanation.
3. A newly coined word or slang.  In this case, more context is needed to understand its meaning and usage.


Please provide more information so I can assist you accurately.
