isonitroso: /ˌaɪsoʊnaɪˈtroʊsoʊ/ | adj. | 异腈基的；亚硝基的 |  Describes a chemical compound containing the isonitroso group (-C(=NOH)-).  This group is an isomer of the nitroso group (-NO). Isonitroso compounds often exhibit tautomerism. | 例句：The synthesis of isonitrosoacetophenone involves a nitrosation reaction.  异硝基苯乙酮的合成涉及一个亚硝化反应。


The isonitroso group is characterized by its ability to form metal complexes.  异腈基的特征在于其形成金属配合物的能力。


词源:  The term is a combination of "iso-" (meaning "equal" or "similar," indicating isomerism) and "nitroso" (referring to the -NO group).  Therefore, it literally means "similar to nitroso," highlighting its structural relationship to the nitroso group.
