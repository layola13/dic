USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a medical context, particularly in obstetrics and fetal monitoring. Therefore, grammatical tense usage examples are less relevant than contextual examples showing its application in medical reports and discussions.

Example 1:  "The baseline fetal heart rate was normal, with reassuring nonaccelerations." (The absence of accelerations is a positive finding) = 胎儿心率基线正常，令人放心的没有加速现象。(加速的缺失是一个积极的发现)

Example 2:  "The presence of recurrent decelerations, rather than nonaccelerations, raised concerns about fetal well-being." (Contrasting nonaccelerations with decelerations) =  反复出现的减速，而不是没有加速，引起了对胎儿健康的担忧。(将非加速与减速进行对比)
