词源:
The word "project" comes from the Latin word "projectus," the past participle of "projicere," meaning "to throw forward."  This reflects the original sense of the word, relating to throwing or casting something forward, like light or an image. Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass planned undertakings and schemes.
