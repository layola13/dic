词源:
The word "overhastened" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the adjective "hastened" (meaning "hurried" or "done quickly").  "Hastened" itself derives from the Old English word "hatian," meaning "to hate," but evolved through Middle English "hasten" to mean "to hurry."  The meaning shift reflects the sense of urgency often associated with things done quickly, sometimes to the detriment of care.
