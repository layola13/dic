词源:
The word "inconformity" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the noun "conformity."  "Conformity" comes from the Old French "conformité," ultimately from the Latin "conformitas," meaning "agreement,"  "similarity," or "adaptation."  Therefore, "inconformity" literally means "not conforming" or "lack of conformity."
