hydrochlorofluorocarbon:/ˌhaɪdroʊˌklɔːroʊˌfluːrəʊˈkɑːrbən/| n. |氢氯氟烃|A hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) is a type of ozone-depleting substance that contains hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine, and carbon atoms.  They were introduced as a less damaging alternative to chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), but are still harmful to the ozone layer, albeit less so than CFCs.  HCFCs are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol.|The use of hydrochlorofluorocarbons is being phased out due to their ozone-depleting potential.|近义词：halocarbon, refrigerant (in some contexts)|反义词：None directly, but substances with negligible ozone depletion potential could be considered indirect antonyms.
