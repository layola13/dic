heterocyst:/ˈhɛtərəʊsɪst/| n. |异形胞，异型胞|A specialized, thick-walled cell in certain cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) that carries out nitrogen fixation.  Heterocysts are differentiated from vegetative cells and are crucial for the survival of these organisms in nitrogen-poor environments. They provide a micro-environment with low oxygen levels necessary for nitrogenase, the enzyme responsible for nitrogen fixation, to function effectively.|Example:  The cyanobacterium *Anabaena* forms heterocysts along its filaments to fix atmospheric nitrogen.  蓝细菌鱼腥藻在其丝状体上形成异形胞以固定大气氮。|近义词：nitrogen-fixing cell |反义词：vegetative cell

虚拟语气:
If the nitrogen levels were lower, more heterocysts would form. = 如果氮水平更低，就会形成更多的异形胞。
