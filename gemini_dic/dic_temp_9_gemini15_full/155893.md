photocell:/ˈfoʊtoʊsɛl/| n. |光电管，光电池|A photocell is an electronic device that converts light energy into electrical energy.  It works on the principle of the photoelectric effect, where light striking a photosensitive material causes the emission of electrons, creating an electric current.|The photocell in the streetlight automatically turns it on at dusk. 街道上的光电管在黄昏时自动打开路灯。|The solar panel uses many photocells to generate electricity. 太阳能电池板使用许多光电管来发电。|light sensor, photosensor |(none specifically antonymous)|名词
