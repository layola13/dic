词源:  The word "quibbler" is derived from the verb "quibble," which ultimately traces back to the Middle English word "quibbe," meaning a "subtlety, quip, or jest." This in turn might be connected to a now-obsolete word "quib," meaning a trick or quip.  The meaning evolved to encompass the act of making frivolous objections.
