词源:

The word "exotisms" is derived from the adjective "exotic," which ultimately comes from the Greek word "exōtikós," meaning "external" or "foreign."  This term was originally used to describe plants and animals that were not native to a particular region. Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass any aspect of a foreign culture or environment that appears unusual or striking to an outsider.  The "-isms" suffix indicates a characteristic or phenomenon.
