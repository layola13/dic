词源:

The word "guild" comes from the Old English word "gild," meaning "payment," "fine," or "compensation."  This reflects the original function of guilds, which often involved paying dues and fines.  The word evolved through Middle English "gilde" and eventually to its modern form.  The root is related to words in other Germanic languages with similar meanings.
