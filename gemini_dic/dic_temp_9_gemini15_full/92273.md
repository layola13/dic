hyperviscosity:/ˌhaɪpərˌvɪsˈkɒsəti/ | n. |高粘度，超粘度 |The increased viscosity of a fluid, often artificially introduced to model certain physical phenomena.|例句：The simulation employed hyperviscosity to damp out unwanted numerical oscillations. 模拟采用高粘度来抑制不需要的数值振荡。

例句：Researchers used hyperviscosity in their computational fluid dynamics model to stabilize the solution. 研究人员在其计算流体动力学模型中使用了高粘度来稳定解。


近义词：high viscosity, excessive viscosity | 反义词：low viscosity, thinness


词源: hyper- (超，过) + viscosity (粘度)  来自拉丁语 *viscum ("birdlime, mistletoe")
