crankshaft:/ˈkræŋkʃɑːft/| n.|曲轴|A crankshaft is a rotating shaft that transforms reciprocating motion into rotary motion.  It's a crucial component in internal combustion engines, converting the linear movement of pistons into the rotational power needed to turn the wheels of a vehicle or drive other machinery.  The crankshaft typically has a series of throws or journals, connected by crankpins, which receive the reciprocating motion from the connecting rods.  These crankpins then convert this motion into rotation.|The car's engine relies on a strong crankshaft to transfer power to the wheels.  The mechanic inspected the crankshaft for any signs of damage.|camshaft, rotating shaft|broken shaft.
