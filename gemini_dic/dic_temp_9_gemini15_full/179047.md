词源:
The word "redemption" comes from the Old French word "redempcion," which itself comes from the Latin word "redemptio," meaning "a buying back, ransom."  The Latin word is formed from "re-" (again) and "emere" (to buy).  The original meaning thus focused on the act of buying something back, often a captive or a debt.  The theological meaning of spiritual redemption evolved from this, referring to the act of God "buying back" humanity from sin.
