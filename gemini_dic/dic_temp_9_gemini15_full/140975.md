词源:

The word "onefoldness" is a relatively rare word formed from the prefix "one-" (meaning one or single) and the noun "fold" (in this context referring to a layer, aspect, or state).  It's a direct combination signifying a state of being single or having only one aspect.  There isn't a long and complex etymological history like some words; it's a straightforward modern formation.


用法说明:

Onefoldness emphasizes a lack of complexity or diversity.  It suggests a single, undivided, or uniform quality.  The word is used less frequently than synonyms like "simplicity" or "unity," often appearing in more formal or philosophical contexts where the nuance of a single, unlayered state is important.


例句:

The onefoldness of the narrative made it predictable but also somewhat unsatisfying.  叙述的单一性使其可预测，但也有些令人不满意。

He admired the onefoldness of the design, its elegant simplicity. 他欣赏设计的单一性，其优雅的简洁。
