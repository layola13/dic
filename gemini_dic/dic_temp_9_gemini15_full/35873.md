词源:
The origin of "cockup" is uncertain, but it is likely a combination of "cock" (meaning a small, insignificant thing) and "up" (implying a raising or disordering).  The word's association with mistakes and failures likely emerged through colloquial usage.  The exact etymological path remains unclear and is not definitively documented in standard etymological dictionaries.
