hunkerousnesses:/ˈhʌŋkərəsnəsiz/ | n. | 顽固的习性；固执的倾向；(尤指因恐惧或不安全感而产生的) 蜷缩的姿态 |  The word "hunkerousnesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a nonce word,  created by adding the suffix "-nesses" to "hunkerous," which itself is an uncommon and informal word. "Hunkerous" suggests a state of being hunkered down, often implying stubbornness, resistance, or a reluctance to move or change.  Therefore, "hunkerousnesses" would likely refer to multiple instances or aspects of this stubborn, hunkered-down behavior or state.  There are no standard dictionary definitions or usage examples.  Its meaning is entirely dependent on the context in which it is used. | Example:  (Hypothetical) "His hunkerousnesses were evident in his refusal to leave the bunker, despite the imminent danger."  = 他固执地拒绝离开掩体，即使面临迫在眉睫的危险，这充分体现了他的顽固。 | 近义词:  stubbornnesses, intransigence,  obstinacies | 反义词: flexibilities,  adaptabilities, compliances | n.
