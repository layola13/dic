outpleasing: /ˌaʊtˈpliːzɪŋ/ | adj. | 超越取悦的，过分讨好的 |  This word is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It's likely a newly coined word or a misspelling.  It seems to be formed by combining "out-" (meaning to surpass or exceed) and "pleasing" (meaning agreeable or delightful). Therefore, it suggests exceeding the bounds of pleasantness, perhaps implying excessive or insincere flattery. There are no established examples of its use in literature or common speech.  | No examples available due to the word's non-standard nature. |  Near synonyms might include: overly flattering, excessively accommodating, ingratiating (but these don't perfectly capture the "out-" prefix's implication of exceeding a limit). | Antonyms might include:  displeasing, offensive, unaccommodating. | adj.
