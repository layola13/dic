WORD ORIGIN->
The word "flea-bitten" is a compound word formed from "flea" (a small wingless jumping insect that feeds on the blood of mammals and birds) and "bitten" (the past participle of the verb "bite").  It literally means "bitten by fleas," but has evolved to also describe things that are worn, shabby, or dilapidated, reflecting the appearance of something repeatedly attacked by fleas.
