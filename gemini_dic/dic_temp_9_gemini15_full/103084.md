词源:
The word "jeopardy" comes from the Anglo-Norman French word "jeu partie," meaning "game played," specifically referring to a game of chance with a significant risk of loss.  It entered English in the late 14th century.  The modern understanding of jeopardy as a state of danger or risk evolved from this earlier association with gambling and uncertainty.
