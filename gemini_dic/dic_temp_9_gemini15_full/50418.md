词源:
Deprivation comes from the verb "deprive," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "depriver," meaning "to rob," "to take away," or "to deprive."  The Old French word itself has roots in the Latin word "privare," which combines the prefix "pri-" (meaning "without," "deprived of") and the verb "vare" (meaning "to take away," "to remove").  Therefore, "deprivation" literally means the act or state of being robbed or taken away of something.
