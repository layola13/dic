The word "outcheats" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a newly coined word, a misspelling, or a word from a specific jargon or dialect.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis in the requested format.  To provide the requested analysis, a valid English word is needed.
