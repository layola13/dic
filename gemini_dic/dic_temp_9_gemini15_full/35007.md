clonally:/ˈkloʊnəli/ | adv. | 克隆地；无性繁殖地 |  Adverb describing something that occurs or is produced through clonal reproduction, meaning from a single ancestor without sexual reproduction. It emphasizes the genetic identity of the offspring. | The plants were grown clonally from a single parent plant.  这些植物是由单一母本植物无性繁殖而来的。|  asexually, genetically identically | sexually | adv.

USAGE->

虚拟语气:
If the cells were grown clonally, the results would be more reliable. = 如果细胞是无性繁殖的，结果会更可靠。
I wish the plants had been grown clonally for better consistency. = 我希望这些植物是无性繁殖的，以获得更好的一致性。


被动语态:
The plants were grown clonally. = 植物是无性繁殖的。
The cell lines are clonally expanded. = 细胞系正在克隆扩增。


疑问句:
Were the plants grown clonally? = 这些植物是无性繁殖的吗？

否定句:
The plants were not grown clonally. = 这些植物不是无性繁殖的。
