词源:

The word "eudaemonistic" is derived from the Greek word "eudaimonia" (εὐδαιμονία), which translates roughly to "good spirit," "happiness," or "flourishing."  It's a complex concept in ancient Greek philosophy, encompassing more than just simple pleasure but also virtue, fulfillment, and living a life of purpose.  The "-istic" suffix indicates an adjective describing something related to or characterized by eudaimonia.
