linearity:/ˌlɪniˈærəti/ | n. |线性，线性度 |The property of being linear;  a mathematical relationship or function in which a change in one quantity results in a directly proportional change in another quantity.  It implies a straight-line relationship between variables. |例句：The graph shows a clear linearity between temperature and pressure.  该图显示温度和压力之间存在明显的线性关系。

例句：The model assumes linearity in the relationship between input and output.  该模型假设输入和输出之间存在线性关系。


近义词：proportionality, straightness |反义词：nonlinearity, curvature |词性: n.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The graph demonstrates linearity. = 该图展示了线性关系。
Linearity is assumed in this calculation. = 此计算中假设线性关系。


一般过去时:
The experiment confirmed linearity. = 实验证实了线性关系。
The results showed a high degree of linearity. = 结果显示高度的线性关系。


现在完成时:
Scientists have observed linearity in many natural phenomena. = 科学家们已经在许多自然现象中观察到线性关系。
Researchers have established the linearity of the model. = 研究人员已经确定了该模型的线性关系。


过去完成时:
They had already established the linearity before the new data arrived. = 新数据到达之前，他们已经确定了线性关系。
Scientists had previously assumed linearity, but the new findings challenged that assumption. = 科学家们之前假设线性关系，但新的发现挑战了这一假设。


将来时:
Further research will determine the linearity of the effect. = 进一步的研究将确定这种效应的线性关系。
We will explore the limits of linearity in this system. = 我们将探讨该系统中线性关系的局限性。


虚拟语气:
If the relationship were linear, the results would be different. = 如果关系是线性的，结果将会不同。
It would be helpful if the data showed perfect linearity. = 如果数据显示完美的线性关系，那就有帮助了。


被动语态:
Linearity was assumed in the initial analysis. = 初始分析中假设了线性关系。
The linearity of the system is being investigated. = 正在调查该系统的线性关系。


疑问句:
Is there linearity in the data? = 数据中存在线性关系吗？
Does the model exhibit linearity? = 该模型是否表现出线性关系？


否定句:
The data do not show linearity. = 数据没有显示线性关系。
There is no linearity between these two variables. = 这两个变量之间不存在线性关系。


PHRASE->
degree of linearity: 线性度
test for linearity: 线性检验
linearity assumption: 线性假设
violation of linearity: 线性违反
range of linearity: 线性范围
