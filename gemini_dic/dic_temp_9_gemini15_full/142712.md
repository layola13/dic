词源:

The word "otiose" comes from the Latin word "otiosus," meaning "at leisure," "idle," or "unoccupied."  This in turn derives from "otium," meaning "leisure" or "ease." The shift in meaning from "leisurely" to "useless" reflects a societal shift in the valuation of leisure.  In ancient times, leisure was associated with intellectual pursuits and contemplation; in later periods, it became more associated with idleness and lack of productivity.


用法说明:

"Otiose" is primarily used to describe something that is unnecessary, unproductive, or purposeless.  It often implies a sense of wasted effort or time.  While it can describe a person who is idle, it's more commonly used to describe things or actions.  The word carries a slightly more formal tone than simpler synonyms like "useless."
