The word "chachan" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A slang term or dialect word:**  If it's a slang term or regional word, providing the context where you encountered it would be helpful.
* **A proper noun:**  It might be a name (person, place, or thing).
* **A word from another language:** If it's from another language, please specify the language.
