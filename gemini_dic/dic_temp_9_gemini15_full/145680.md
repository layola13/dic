/ˌoʊvərˈkuːlnəsɪz/ | n. |过冷；过分冷静；冷淡 |The word "overcoolness's" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be an incorrect or non-standard grammatical form.  It seems to be attempting to make "overcoolness" possessive, but the apostrophe-s is misplaced. The correct possessive form would be "overcoolness's" if referring to something belonging to overcoolness, but this is still unusual.  The word "overcoolness" itself, while understandable, is not frequently used. It describes an excessive degree of coolness or coldness, either literally (referring to temperature) or figuratively (referring to a person's demeanor).| Example:  The *overcoolness's* effect on the experiment was noticeable. (This sentence is grammatically questionable but illustrates the intended use.) |  近义词: coldness, detachment, apathy, indifference, impassivity | 反义词: warmth, enthusiasm, passion, fervor


USAGE->
This word is not standard English, so standard grammatical usage examples are not applicable.  The example sentence above uses it in a contrived possessive context.  Proper use would involve using "overcoolness" correctly in a sentence, and then using a proper possessive if needed, such as modifying a noun.  For example:  "The experiment suffered from overcoolness; its results were compromised."

PHRASE->
Because "overcoolness's" is not a standard word, phrases using it are not established.  Instead, phrases using the word "overcoolness" might include:

a show of overcoolness
an air of overcoolness
suffering from overcoolness
marked by overcoolness
a state of overcoolness
