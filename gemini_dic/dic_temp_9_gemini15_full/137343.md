词源:
The word "nontaxableness" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the word "taxableness," which is derived from "taxable" (meaning "subject to tax").  The suffix "-ness" turns the adjective "taxable" into a noun, indicating a state or quality. Therefore, "nontaxableness" literally means "the state of not being taxable."
