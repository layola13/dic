/kɒŋˌɡreɡeɪtɪvnəsɪz/ | n. | 群居性；聚集倾向（复数） | The study investigated the congregativenesses of different ant species. 这项研究调查了不同蚂蚁物种的群居性。 |  近义词：gregariousness (群体性), sociality (社会性) | 反义词：solitariness (独居性), isolation (孤立)


The word "congregativenesses" is the plural form of "congregativeness," which itself is a relatively uncommon noun.


Etymology:

The word derives from the verb "congregate" + the suffix "-ive" (forming an adjective) + the suffix "-ness" (forming a noun).  "Congregate" comes from the Latin word "congregare," meaning "to gather together," formed from "con-" (together) and "gregare" (to flock or gather).


Usage:

While "congregativeness" is used less frequently than synonyms like "gregariousness" or "sociality," it specifically emphasizes the tendency to gather or assemble.  It highlights the inherent inclination of a being or group to congregate, not just the act of doing so.


Example Sentences (using "congregativeness"):

The high congregativeness of these birds makes them easy targets for hunters.  这些鸟类高度的群居性使它们很容易成为猎人的目标。


The study revealed significant differences in the congregativeness of the two subspecies.  研究揭示了这两个亚种的群居性存在显著差异。


Because "congregativenesses" is the plural, it would only be used when referring to multiple instances of congregative tendencies, perhaps comparing different groups or species.  Examples might be less common, given the infrequent use of the singular.  An example might be:

The researchers noted distinct congregativenesses in the various colonies they studied. 研究人员注意到他们研究的各个群体中明显的群居性差异。


Note: The word "congregativenesses" is likely to be avoided in most contexts in favor of clearer, more common synonyms.  The plural form adds little practical value beyond strictly grammatical correctness in a highly specific case.
