词源:
The word "chariness" ultimately derives from the Old English word "cēare," meaning "care," "worry," or "anxiety."  This evolved through Middle English "charite" (meaning care or concern) and later forms reflecting the development of the meaning toward caution and wariness.  The "-ness" suffix indicates a state or quality.
