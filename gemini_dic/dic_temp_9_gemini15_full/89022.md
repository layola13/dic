词源:
The word "hollyhock" ultimately derives from the Old English word *holihoc, which itself is a combination of *hōlī (holy) and *hoc (mallow).  The "holy" element likely refers to its association with religious sites or its perceived medicinal properties in the past.  The "mallow" element correctly identifies its botanical family.  The word's evolution reflects its long history in European gardens and culture.
