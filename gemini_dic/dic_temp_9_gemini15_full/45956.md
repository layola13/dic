The word "cwit" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
2. **It's slang or dialectal:**  The word might be used informally within a specific region, community, or social group.  More context is needed to understand its meaning and usage.
3. **It's a newly coined word:**  It's possible the word is very recent and hasn't yet been included in dictionaries.

To help me provide the requested analysis, please provide more context, such as:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (e.g., a book, a conversation, a website)
* **What was the surrounding text or conversation?** This will help determine the intended meaning.
