词源:

The term "right-winger" originates from the seating arrangements in the French National Assembly during the French Revolution.  Those who sat on the right of the presiding officer generally supported the monarchy and traditional values, while those on the left supported revolutionary change.  This spatial arrangement became a metaphor for the political spectrum, with "right" associating with conservatism and "left" associating with liberalism.  The "-wing" suffix, borrowed from the imagery of a bird's wings, emphasizes the grouping and alliance of those sharing similar political stances.
