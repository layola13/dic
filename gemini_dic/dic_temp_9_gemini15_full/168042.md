privateers:/ˌpraɪvəˈtɪrz/| n. |私掠船；私掠船船员 |A privateer is a privately owned ship that is authorized by a government to attack and capture enemy ships during wartime.  They operated under a "letter of marque," a document granting them permission to engage in this activity.  Unlike pirates, privateers were legally sanctioned, though often operating on the fringes of legality. |Example: During the Napoleonic Wars, many British privateers preyed on French shipping.  在拿破仑战争期间，许多英国私掠船袭击法国船只。


Example:  The captain of the privateer was a ruthless but successful raider. 私掠船船长是一个冷酷但成功的袭击者。


近义词：corsair, buccaneer (though these terms often imply less legal sanction)


反义词：none (the concept doesn't have a direct opposite)
