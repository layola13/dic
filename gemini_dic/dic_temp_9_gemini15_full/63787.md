epicycle:/ˈɛpɪsaɪkəl/| n. |本轮; 周转循环|A small circle whose center moves around the circumference of a larger circle.  In the Ptolemaic system of astronomy, planets were thought to move in epicycles whose centers moved along larger circles (deferents) around the Earth.|Example: The Ptolemaic model of the solar system used epicycles to explain the apparent retrograde motion of planets. 托勒密太阳系模型使用本轮来解释行星的视逆行运动。|近义词：orbit, cycle|反义词：N/A


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The planet moves in an epicycle. = 行星在进行本轮运动。
An epicycle describes the movement. = 本轮描述了运动。


一般过去时:
Astronomers used epicycles to explain planetary motion. = 天文学家使用本轮来解释行星运动。
The model included many complex epicycles. = 该模型包含许多复杂的本轮。


现在完成时:
Scientists have abandoned the epicycle model. = 科学家已经放弃了本轮模型。
The study has revealed new insights into epicyclic motion. = 这项研究揭示了对本轮运动的新见解。


过去完成时:
Before the heliocentric model, astronomers had relied on epicycles. = 在日心模型之前，天文学家依赖本轮。
They had already calculated the epicycle's parameters. = 他们已经计算出本轮的参数。


将来时:
Future research will likely refine our understanding of epicycles. = 未来的研究可能会改进我们对本轮的理解。
They will explore the implications of epicyclic motion. = 他们将探索本轮运动的意义。


虚拟语气:
If the planets moved in perfect circles, we wouldn't need epicycles. = 如果行星以完美的圆形运动，我们就无需本轮。
I wish I understood the complexities of epicyclic motion better. = 我希望自己能更好地理解本轮运动的复杂性。


被动语态:
Epicycles were used to explain retrograde motion. = 本轮被用来解释逆行运动。
The epicycle's parameters are being recalculated. = 本轮的参数正在被重新计算。


疑问句:
Did Ptolemy use epicycles in his model? = 托勒密在他的模型中使用了本轮吗？
How many epicycles are needed to accurately represent planetary motion? = 需要多少个本轮才能精确地表示行星运动？


否定句:
The modern model of the solar system doesn't use epicycles. = 现代太阳系模型不使用本轮。
They didn't fully understand the implications of the epicycles. = 他们没有完全理解本轮的意义。


PHRASE->
epicycle theory 本轮理论
