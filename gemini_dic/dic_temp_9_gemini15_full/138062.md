词源:
The word "normal" comes from the Latin word "normalis," meaning "perpendicular," "according to the rule," or "conforming to the rule."  It entered English in the 17th century, initially referring to something at right angles to something else. Its meaning gradually evolved to encompass the more common sense of "conforming to a standard."
