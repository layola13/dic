nappiness's: /ˈnæpinɛsɪz/ | n. | 幸福的；快乐的（nappiness 的所有格）|  This word is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a non-standard formation, likely a misspelling or an attempt to create a possessive form of "nappiness," which itself is not a common word.  "Nappiness" might be intended to mean a state of being happy and content, possibly related to napping and the feeling of relaxation and well-being afterward. However, its usage is extremely limited and not found in standard dictionaries. |  There are no standard examples, near synonyms, or antonyms because the word is not standard English. |  The word lacks standard grammatical usage due to its non-standard nature. |


The correct way to express the possessive would depend on the intended meaning.  If referring to the happiness associated with napping, one might use phrases like: "the nap's happiness," "the happiness from the nap," or "the blissful feeling of the nap."  If "nappiness" is intended as a neologism (newly coined word), one would need to define its meaning and usage context first before forming a possessive.
