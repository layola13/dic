近义词： cosmopolitan, broad-minded, universal, ecumenical, liberal 反义词： parochial, provincial, narrow-minded, insular, local


词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "parochial," which derives from the Old French "paroissial" and ultimately from the Late Latin "parochialis," meaning "of or pertaining to a parish."  A parish is a small administrative district, typically within a church's jurisdiction.  Therefore, "nonparochial" originally meant "not relating to a parish," but its meaning has broadened to encompass a wider lack of narrow-mindedness.
