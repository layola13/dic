preacquitting: /ˌpriːəˈkwɪtɪŋ/ | v. | 预先开释；提前释放 |  The word "preacquitting" is not a standard English word found in common dictionaries.  It's a neologism, likely formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before) and "acquitting" (finding someone not guilty). It implies a situation where someone is declared innocent before a formal trial or judgment has taken place.  This is unusual and potentially problematic in legal contexts, as it suggests a prejudgment of a case.


例句：The judge was accused of preacquitting the defendant, showing clear bias before the evidence was presented. = 法官被指控在证据提交之前就预先开释了被告，表现出明显的偏见。


近义词:  There are no direct synonyms, as the word is not standard.  However, concepts it might relate to include: prejudging, pre-empting, exonerating beforehand.


反义词: pre-convicting, pre-judging guilty.
