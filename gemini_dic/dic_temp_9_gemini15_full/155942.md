photoenzyme: /ˌfoʊtoʊˈɛnzaɪm/ | n. | 光酶 | A photoenzyme is an enzyme that requires light to function.  It catalyzes reactions using light energy.  Many photoenzymes are involved in photosynthesis and other light-dependent processes in organisms. | Example:  Chlorophyll, a crucial component of photosynthesis, acts as a photoenzyme by absorbing light energy and initiating a series of redox reactions.  | 近义词: light-activated enzyme | 反义词: dark enzyme
