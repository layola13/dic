词源:
The term "gaslighting" originates from the 1938 play *Gas Light* and its subsequent film adaptations. In the story, a husband manipulates his wife into believing she is losing her mind by dimming the gas lights in their home and then denying that anything has changed.  This psychological manipulation became the basis for the term.
