词源:
The word "overexerted" is formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") to the past participle "exerted" of the verb "exert".  "Exert" itself comes from the Old French "exert" and ultimately from the Latin "exertus," the past participle of "exertō," meaning "to raise, lift up, exert oneself."
