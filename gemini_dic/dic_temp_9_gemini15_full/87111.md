The word "heraud" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a word from a very specialized or archaic vocabulary, or a word from another language.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
