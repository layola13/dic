counteradaptation:/ˌkaʊntərˌædəpˈteɪʃən/| n. |反适应；对抗适应|A counteradaptation is a trait that has evolved in response to another adaptation in a different species (or sometimes within the same species).  It's a kind of evolutionary arms race. For example, a plant might evolve toxins to deter herbivores, and the herbivores might then evolve mechanisms to detoxify those toxins. This detoxification mechanism in the herbivore would be a counteradaptation.|The development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is a classic example of counteradaptation.  Plants evolving thorns in response to herbivory are also an example.|近义词：evolutionary response, reciprocal adaptation |反义词：adaptation (in the context of a single species' response to environmental pressure, not an antagonistic interaction)|


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The plant's thorns are a counteradaptation to herbivory. = 植物的刺是对食草动物的反适应。
Counteradaptation is a key process in coevolution. = 反适应是协同进化中的一个关键过程。


一般过去时:
The bacteria developed a counteradaptation to the antibiotic. = 细菌对这种抗生素产生了抗药性（反适应）。
Researchers studied the counteradaptation of insects to pesticides. = 研究人员研究了昆虫对杀虫剂的反适应。


现在完成时:
Many species have developed counteradaptations to environmental changes. = 许多物种已经发展出对环境变化的反适应。
Scientists have observed multiple counteradaptations in predator-prey relationships. = 科学家已经观察到捕食者-猎物关系中的多种反适应。


过去完成时:
The parasite had already evolved a counteradaptation to the host's immune system. = 寄生虫已经进化出对宿主免疫系统的反适应。
Before the introduction of the pesticide, the insects hadn't developed a counteradaptation. = 在引入杀虫剂之前，昆虫还没有进化出反适应。


将来时:
The researchers predict that the pest will develop a counteradaptation to the new insecticide. = 研究人员预测害虫将对新型杀虫剂产生抗药性（反适应）。
Further research will explore the potential counteradaptations of this species. = 进一步的研究将探索该物种潜在的反适应。


虚拟语气:
If the herbivore hadn't developed a counteradaptation, it would have been extinct. = 如果食草动物没有发展出反适应，它就会灭绝。
It is hypothesized that if the plant hadn't evolved toxins, the herbivore population would have exploded. = 假设如果植物没有进化出毒素，食草动物的数量就会激增。


被动语态:
The counteradaptation was observed in multiple populations. = 在多个种群中观察到这种反适应。
Counteradaptations are being actively studied by evolutionary biologists. = 反适应正在被进化生物学家积极研究。


疑问句:
What counteradaptations have evolved in response to climate change? = 为了应对气候变化，进化出了哪些反适应？
What is the evolutionary significance of counteradaptation? = 反适应的进化意义是什么？


否定句:
The insect did not develop a successful counteradaptation to the new pesticide. = 这种昆虫没有对新型杀虫剂产生成功的抗药性（反适应）。
The plant lacked any effective counteradaptation to the fungal infection. = 这种植物缺乏对真菌感染的任何有效反适应。


PHRASE->

counteradaptation mechanism: 反适应机制
counteradaptation strategy: 反适应策略
evolutionary counteradaptation: 进化反适应
host-parasite counteradaptation: 宿主-寄生虫反适应
predator-prey counteradaptation: 捕食者-猎物反适应
