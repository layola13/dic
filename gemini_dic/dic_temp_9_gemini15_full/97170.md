词源:  From Latin *infirmare "to weaken," from in- "not" + firmare "to strengthen."  The modern sense evolved from the original meaning of "weakening" to "making weak," then to "supporting" as in "supporting a claim" by providing evidence.  The shift in meaning reflects a legal context where evidence that weakens the opposing side implicitly strengthens the proponent's case.
