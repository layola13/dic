disproperty: /dɪsˈprɒpəti/ | n. | 剥夺财产；财产丧失；不当得利 |  The word "disproperty" is not a standard English word found in common dictionaries.  It seems to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a very rare term, possibly formed by combining "dis-" (meaning removal or negation) and "property."  Its meaning would likely be related to the deprivation of property or the loss of ownership of property. There is no established usage or definition.  Therefore, creating examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical explanations is impossible without further context or confirmation of its actual meaning and usage in a specific field or context.  It's crucial to use established vocabulary in formal writing and communication.
