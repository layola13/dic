词源:
The word "cartography" comes from the Medieval Latin word "cartographia," which is a combination of "charta" (meaning "paper" or "map") and "graphia" (meaning "writing" or "drawing").  Therefore, the word literally means "map-making" or "map-drawing".  The term evolved from the practice of mapmaking throughout history, reflecting advancements in technology and understanding of geography.
