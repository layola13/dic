词源:

The word "disgustfulness" is derived from the adjective "disgusting," which itself comes from the verb "disgust."  "Disgust" is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away" or "not") and the verb "gust," meaning "to taste" or "to like."  The "-fulness" suffix transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating the quality or state of being disgusting.  Therefore, "disgustfulness" denotes the quality or state of being extremely unpleasant or repulsive.
