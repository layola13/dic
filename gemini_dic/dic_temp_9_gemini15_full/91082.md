huttonian:/hʌˈteɪniən/| adj.|休顿式的；关于休顿的；(指地质学理论) 火成论的 | Relating to James Hutton, the Scottish geologist, or to his theories about the Earth's formation.  Hutton's theory, known as Huttonian theory or Plutonism, posited that the Earth's geological features are the result of slow, gradual processes operating over vast periods of time, rather than catastrophic events. This contrasted sharply with the prevailing Neptunist theory, which attributed geological formations primarily to the action of water. |The Huttonian theory revolutionized geology. = 休顿理论彻底改变了地质学。

The Huttonian system of geology is based on uniformitarianism. = 休顿的地质系统是基于均变论的。|近义词：geological, plutonic|反义词：neptunian
