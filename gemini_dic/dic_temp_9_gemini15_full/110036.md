词源:  The word "licence" (and its plural "licences") ultimately derives from the Old French word "licence," meaning "permission," "liberty," or "leave." This, in turn, comes from the Latin word "licentia," which has the same general meaning.  The "lic-" part relates to "licet," meaning "it is permitted," while the "-entia" suffix indicates a state or condition.
