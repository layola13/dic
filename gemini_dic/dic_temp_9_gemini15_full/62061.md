词源:
The word "encashable" is derived from the verb "cash" and the prefix "en-", which means "to make or become."  "Cash" ultimately comes from the Old French "caisse," meaning "box," referring to a strongbox where money was kept.  The "en-" prefix transforms the verb "cash" into an adjective describing something that can be made into cash.
