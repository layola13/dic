词源:
The word "nonvitrified" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "vitrified."  "Vitrified" comes from the verb "vitrify," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "vitrum," meaning "glass."  The process of vitrification involves heating a material to a high temperature until it becomes glassy or nonporous.
