词源：

* **quasi-**:  Latin prefix meaning "as if," "seemingly," or "almost."
* **mysteriously**: From "mystery," ultimately from Old French *mystere* and Latin *ministerium* ("service, duty, mystery").


用法说明：

"Quasi-mysteriously" is an adverbial adjective, modifying a verb or a clause.  It describes something that appears mysterious or has elements of mystery, but without definitively confirming it as such.  The "quasi-" prefix softens the implication of genuine mystery, suggesting a degree of uncertainty or ambiguity.  It's often used to describe situations or events that are strange or unexplained but may have simple explanations yet to be revealed.
