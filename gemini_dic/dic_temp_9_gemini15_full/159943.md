/ˈpɒlifoʊt/| n. |多光子|  A polyphote is a device or system that uses multiple photons (light particles) in a process or application. It's a relatively recent term, not found in standard dictionaries, and its usage is highly specialized, primarily within the fields of physics and engineering.  The precise meaning depends on the context. It may refer to a multi-photon imaging system, a device for multi-photon excitation, or a system leveraging multiple photons for other applications like quantum computing or communication. |例句：The researchers developed a novel polyphote microscope for high-resolution imaging of biological tissues.  研究人员开发了一种新型多光子显微镜，用于对生物组织进行高分辨率成像。|近义词：multiphoton device, multiphoton system |反义词：single-photon device (implicitly)|名词
