It represents a high-level meaning that may involve multiple interconnected aspects.  Unlike morphemes (smallest units of meaning), megasemes are not necessarily directly reflected in the structure of words. They are more abstract and represent broader conceptual fields. |The concept of "justice" could be considered a megaseme, encompassing fairness, equity, lawfulness, and retribution. |近义词：macro-semantic unit, overarching concept|反义词：morpheme, seme (in the sense of minimal semantic unit)|名词
