词源:

The word "remittable" derives from the verb "remit," which comes from the Old French word "remetre," meaning "to put back, return, send back."  This in turn is composed of the prefix "re-" (again, back) and "mettre" (to put, place). The suffix "-able" indicates capability or possibility.  Therefore, "remittable" literally means "capable of being sent back" or "capable of being forgiven."
