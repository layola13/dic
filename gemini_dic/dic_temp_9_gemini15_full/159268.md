poikilitic: /ˌpɔɪkɪˈlɪtɪk/ | adj. |斑杂的；异质的|  Descriptive of a rock texture in which the constituent minerals vary considerably in size and shape.  It refers to a rock texture characterized by large crystals (phenocrysts) embedded in a finer-grained matrix. This texture indicates a complex crystallization history, often involving multiple stages of cooling and/or different environments.  | 例句：The igneous rock exhibited a poikilitic texture, with large feldspar crystals enclosing smaller grains of quartz and biotite.  这种火成岩呈现斑杂结构，大的长石晶体包裹着较小的石英和黑云母颗粒。


The poikilitic texture is common in some metamorphic rocks as well.  一些变质岩中也常见斑杂结构。| 近义词： porphyritic (but porphyritic emphasizes size difference more distinctly than shape), allotriomorphic | 反义词：hypidiomorphic, equigranular

词源:  From Greek *poikilos* ("varied," "many-coloured," "mottled") + *-itic* (adjective suffix indicating "of the nature of").  The term reflects the visually striking variation in crystal sizes and shapes within the rock.
