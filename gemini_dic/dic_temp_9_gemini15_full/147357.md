英文解析:The word "overnarrownesses" refers to instances or conditions of excessive narrowness, particularly in thinking, perspective, or outlook. It suggests a limited and inflexible viewpoint that fails to consider alternative perspectives or broader contexts.  The word emphasizes the degree of narrowness, implying that it goes beyond a simple lack of breadth to something excessive or detrimental.

例句：

The committee's decisions reflected the overnarrownesses of its members' thinking. 委员会的决定反映了其成员思想的过度狭隘。


词源:

The word is formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or to an excessive degree) to "narrowness," which itself is derived from the adjective "narrow" (meaning limited in scope, extent, or range).  Therefore, "overnarrownesses" implies a state or condition of being excessively narrow in one's thinking or perspective.
