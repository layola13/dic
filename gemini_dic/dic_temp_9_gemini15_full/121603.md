词源:
The word "misorderly" is formed by adding the prefix "mis-" (meaning "badly," "wrongly," or "ill") to the adjective "orderly."  "Orderly" comes from the Old French "ordene," meaning "ordered," which in turn derives from the Old French "ordre," meaning "order."  The ultimate origin is the Latin "ordo," also meaning "order," "row," or "rank."
