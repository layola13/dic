词源:
The word "reconquest" is formed from the prefix "re-" (again) and the noun "conquest" (the act of conquering).  "Conquest" itself comes from the Old French word "conqueste," derived from the Latin word "conquistus," the past participle of "conquirere," meaning "to acquire, obtain, or seek."  Therefore, "reconquest" literally means "to conquer again."
