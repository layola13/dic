词源:
The word "discriminate" comes from the Latin word "discriminare," which means "to separate," "to distinguish," or "to discern."  The prefix "dis-" means "apart" and "-criminare" is related to the word "crimen," meaning "judgment" or "decision".  The original meaning was neutral, simply meaning to make a distinction. The negative connotation associated with discrimination developed later.
