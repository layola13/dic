词源:
The word "hardspun" is a compound word formed from "hard" (meaning firm, solid, or strong) and "spun" (the past participle of the verb "spin," referring to the process of twisting fibers together to make yarn or thread).  Therefore, it literally describes yarn or fabric that has been spun tightly, resulting in a strong and durable material.
