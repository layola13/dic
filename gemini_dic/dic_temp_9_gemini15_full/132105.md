用法说明:

"Noncriminals" is a noun that refers to individuals who have not engaged in criminal activities.  It's a straightforward term used in various contexts, including legal, sociological, and criminological discussions.  The plural form is used because it refers to multiple people.  It's important to note that simply being accused of a crime does not make someone a criminal; only conviction does.  Therefore, someone accused of a crime but not yet convicted would still be considered a noncriminal.
