pyocyanin:/ˌpaɪoʊˈsaɪənɪn/| n. |绿脓素|A blue-green pigment produced by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  It is a redox-active phenazine that contributes to the pathogenicity of this bacterium. It is toxic to many cells, including those of the human body. |例句：The presence of pyocyanin in the wound indicated a Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. 绿脓素的存在表明伤口感染了铜绿假单胞菌。|例句：Researchers are studying the mechanism by which pyocyanin damages lung tissue in cystic fibrosis patients. 研究人员正在研究绿脓素如何损害囊性纤维化患者肺组织的机制。|近义词：phenazine (a broader class of compounds)|反义词：N/A|名词
