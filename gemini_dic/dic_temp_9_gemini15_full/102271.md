The provided word "{ition}" is not a standalone English word.  It's a suffix, not a word with its own meaning or pronunciation.  Therefore, it cannot be analyzed according to the requested format.  The format is designed for complete words, not morphemes (meaningful units of language).  To analyze it, we need to consider words *containing* the suffix "-ition".

For example, let's analyze the word "condition":

/kənˈdɪʃən/ | n. | 条件，状况 | A state of being; the way something is | The condition of the car is poor. 这辆车的状况很糟糕。 | state, situation, circumstance | chaos, disorder | noun
