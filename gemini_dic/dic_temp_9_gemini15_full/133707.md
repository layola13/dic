词源:

The word "nonfrigid" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "frigid" (meaning "extremely cold; lacking warmth or feeling").  Therefore, "nonfrigid" literally means "not frigid."  The word's usage has expanded to encompass the sense of passionate or enthusiastic, contrasting directly with the coldness implied by "frigid."
