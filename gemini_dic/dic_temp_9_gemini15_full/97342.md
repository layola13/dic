词源:

The word "infortunate" comes from the Old French word "infortuné,"  which itself is a combination of the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and "fortuné" (meaning "fortunate" or "lucky").  "Fortuné" ultimately derives from the Latin word "fortunatus," the past participle of "fortunare," meaning "to make lucky" or "to favor."
