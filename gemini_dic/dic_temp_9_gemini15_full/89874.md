horopter:/ˈhɒrɒptər/| n. |视平线，视差零线|The horopter is the locus of points in space that project to corresponding points on the two retinas.  It represents the points in space that are seen as single images.  The horopter is crucial in understanding binocular vision and depth perception.  It's a curved line, not a plane, and its exact shape varies depending on eye position and the convergence angle. |Example: Understanding the horopter is essential for comprehending how our brains perceive three-dimensional space using the input from both eyes.|近义词：visual surface, line of sight (partially)|反义词：None directly applicable.
