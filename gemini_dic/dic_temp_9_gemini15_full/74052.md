词源:
The word "fossick" originates from Australian English. Its etymology is uncertain, but it is believed to be derived from a now-obsolete word with a similar meaning.  Some speculate a possible connection to the Middle English word "fosse," meaning a ditch or trench, suggesting a connection to digging or searching in earth. However, this link remains unproven.  Its usage became prevalent during the Australian gold rushes of the 19th century, solidifying its meaning related to searching for gold and other valuable items.
