词源：

* **decompose:**  From Old French *decomposer*, from Latin *de-* (away, from) + *componere* (to put together).  Meaning "to separate into constituent parts".

* **-able:**  Suffix indicating capability or possibility.

* **-ities:**  Suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating qualities or states.


Therefore, "decomposabilities" signifies the qualities or states of being decomposable, the degrees to which something can be broken down.  The word is relatively uncommon in everyday language and is primarily used in technical contexts.
