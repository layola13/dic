noncircuited:/ˌnɒnˈsɜːkɪtɪd/| adj. |未短路的；未闭合的 | Not having a short circuit; not closed.  This term is primarily used in electrical engineering to describe a circuit that is functioning correctly because there is no unintended path for current to flow. | Example: The technician confirmed the wiring was noncircuited before turning on the power. 技师在通电前确认线路没有短路。|近义词：unshorted, intact, unbroken |反义词：shorted, circuited


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The circuit remains noncircuited. = 电路保持未短路状态。
This component ensures the system is noncircuited. = 这个组件确保系统未短路。


一般过去时:
The wire was noncircuited before the accident. = 事故发生前，电线是完好的(未短路)。
The engineer checked that all connections were noncircuited. = 工程师检查了所有连接是否完好(未短路)。


现在完成时:
The system has remained noncircuited throughout the test. = 在整个测试过程中，系统一直保持未短路状态。
We have confirmed that the circuit is noncircuited. = 我们已经确认电路没有短路。


过去完成时:
The circuit had been noncircuited until the surge occurred. = 直到出现浪涌之前，电路一直是完好的(未短路)。
They had ensured the wiring was noncircuited before starting the machine. = 他们在启动机器之前确保线路完好(未短路)。


将来时:
The technician will ensure the circuit remains noncircuited. = 技师将确保电路保持未短路状态。
The new design will keep the circuit noncircuited under high load. = 新的设计将使电路在高负载下保持未短路状态。


虚拟语气:
If the circuit were noncircuited, the device would function properly. = 如果电路完好(未短路)，设备将正常工作。

被动语态:
The circuit was found to be noncircuited after inspection. = 检查后发现电路完好(未短路)。
The system is kept noncircuited by a safety mechanism. = 系统通过安全机制保持未短路状态。


疑问句:
Is the circuit noncircuited? = 电路完好(未短路)吗？
Are all the connections noncircuited? = 所有连接都完好(未短路)吗？


否定句:
The circuit is not noncircuited; it's shorted. = 电路没有完好(未短路)；它短路了。
The system was not noncircuited during the storm. = 暴风雨期间系统没有保持未短路状态。


PHRASE->
There is no commonly used phrase with "noncircuited". The word is primarily used as a standalone adjective in technical contexts.  Instead, phrases would use synonyms like "intact circuit," "unshorted circuit," or "working circuit."
