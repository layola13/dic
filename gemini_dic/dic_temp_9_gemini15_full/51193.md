词源:
The word "destigmatize" is formed from the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse") and the word "stigmatize" (meaning "to mark with a stigma," implying disgrace or shame).  The root "stigma" comes from the Greek word "stigma," meaning "a mark burned with a hot iron," later developing the figurative meaning of a mark of disgrace.
