The word "jaal" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a word from another language, possibly Hindi or Urdu.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, etymology, detailed usage examples, synonyms, or antonyms in the requested format.  To get this information, you would need to specify the language of origin.
