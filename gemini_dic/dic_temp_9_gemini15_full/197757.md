词源:
The word "shilly-shally" is of uncertain origin.  One theory suggests it comes from a combination of "shilly" (possibly a variant of "silly") and "shally" (perhaps related to "shallow" or expressing a lack of depth of character).  Its meaning developed over time to represent indecisiveness and wavering.
