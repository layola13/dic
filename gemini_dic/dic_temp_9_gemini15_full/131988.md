Word Origin:

The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "conveyances."  "Conveyances" comes from the verb "convey," meaning "to transport" or "to transmit."  The root of "convey" is the Latin word "convehere," which combines "con-" (together) and "vehere" (to carry).  Therefore, "nonconveyances" literally means "things that are not used for carrying or transporting."
