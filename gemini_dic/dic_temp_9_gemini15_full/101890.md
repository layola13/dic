isenthalpic:/ˌaɪsɛnˈθæl.pɪk/| adj.|等焓的|Of or relating to a process that occurs at constant enthalpy.  In thermodynamics, an isenthalpic process is one where the enthalpy of the system remains constant.  This often occurs during throttling processes or Joule-Thomson expansion where the gas expands through a valve without significant heat exchange with the surroundings.| Example: The Joule-Thomson expansion is an isenthalpic process. 焦耳-汤姆逊膨胀是一个等焓过程。|近义词：constant-enthalpy|反义词：non-isenthalpic

USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the context of thermodynamics and doesn't have common usage in everyday language.  Therefore, examples showing tenses and other grammatical forms wouldn't be natural or meaningful.  The word is descriptive and usually appears as an adjective modifying a noun.


Example Sentences:

The isenthalpic expansion of the gas cooled it slightly.  气体的等焓膨胀使其略微冷却。

The process was carried out isenthalpically to minimize energy loss.  为了最大限度地减少能量损失，该过程以等焓方式进行。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "isenthalpic".  The term is highly specialized.
