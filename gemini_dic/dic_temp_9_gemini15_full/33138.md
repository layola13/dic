The word "christop" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  There is no pronunciation, definition, or usage to provide.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a proper noun (a name perhaps), or a word from a specialized or informal context.  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
