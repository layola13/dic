用法说明:

This is a relatively uncommon word, used primarily in scientific or literary contexts when a precise description of hair color is needed.  It is less frequently used in everyday conversation.  While "dark-haired" or "black-haired" are more common synonyms, melanocomous offers a more formal and precise alternative.  There are no specific grammatical considerations beyond standard adjective usage.
