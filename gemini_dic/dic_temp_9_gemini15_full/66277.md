词源:  The word derives from the verb "excommunicate," which itself comes from the Late Latin "excommunicāre,"  a combination of the prefix "ex-" (out, from) and "communicare" (to share, to communicate).  The original meaning was to exclude someone from the community of the church, thus implying a severing of communication and fellowship.  The adjective "excommunicable" naturally follows, describing that which is incapable of being brought back into communion.
