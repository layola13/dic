post-meiotic:/ˌpoʊstmaɪˈɒtɪk/| adj.|减数分裂后的|Post-meiotic refers to the stage of development in a cell or organism that occurs after meiosis, the type of cell division that results in the formation of gametes (sex cells).  It describes processes, events, or structures that happen after the completion of meiosis.  |例句：Post-meiotic segregation of chromosomes can lead to genetic abnormalities. 减数分裂后染色体的分离可能导致基因异常。

The study of post-meiotic gene expression is crucial for understanding spermatogenesis.  对减数分裂后基因表达的研究对于理解精子发生至关重要。|近义词：postmeiotic |反义词：premeiotic
