词源:
The word "saturninely" is derived from the name "Saturn," the Roman god of agriculture, time, and (significantly for this word's meaning)  harvest, and also associated with death and destruction.  In astrology, Saturn represents discipline, restraint, and melancholy.  The adjective "saturnine" (from which "saturninely" is derived) came to be associated with the planet's perceived influence, signifying a gloomy, serious, and sometimes even cruel disposition.  The connection lies in the association of Saturn with a slow, deliberate, and often somber aspect of life.
