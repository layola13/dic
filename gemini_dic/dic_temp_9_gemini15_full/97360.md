英文解析:The word "infractible" describes something that cannot be broken, violated, or infringed upon. It suggests a strong sense of inviolability and resistance to any attempt to compromise it.  It is often used in the context of laws, agreements, or principles that are considered sacrosanct and unalterable.


例句：

词源:

The word "infractible" is derived from the Latin prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the verb "frangere" (meaning "to break").  The suffix "-ible" indicates capability or possibility, but in this case, the "in-" prefix negates it, resulting in the meaning "not breakable."
