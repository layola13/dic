The word "recompares" does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To help you, I can offer possibilities assuming it's a combination of "re-" and "compares":

(Phrases using "re-compare" are context-dependent and would need to be constructed based on the specific usage.)




**Possibility 2: A misspelling of a different word**

If "recompares" is a misspelling, it might be a typo of a different word entirely.  Please double-check the original source.


Without further context, it's difficult to give a more precise analysis.  Provide more information about where you encountered this word, and I might be able to assist further.
