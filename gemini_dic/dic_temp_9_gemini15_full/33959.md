The word "cis's" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a non-standard usage.  It might be intended to represent one of the following:

* **cis's (as a possessive form of "cis"):**  If this is the case, "cis" itself needs clarification.  "Cis" is a prefix meaning "on the same side," often used in chemistry (e.g., cis-isomer) and more recently in relation to gender identity (cisgender).  In this context, "cis's" would be grammatically incorrect.  The possessive form would be "cis'" or "of cis".

* **A misspelling of other words:**  It could be a misspelling of words like "this," "his," "kiss," or other words depending on the context.  Without more context, it's impossible to determine the intended word.

Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible without knowing the intended word or phrase.  Please provide the correct spelling or context where you encountered "cis's" for a proper explanation.
