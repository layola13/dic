The word "mislum" is not a word found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific dialect or jargon, or a proper noun.  To provide the analysis you request, I'd need clarification on the intended word or context in which you encountered "mislum."
