词源:
The word "management" comes from the Old French word "maniement," which means "handling" or "management."  This, in turn, derives from the verb "manier," meaning "to handle" or "to manage," ultimately stemming from the Latin word "manus," meaning "hand."  The evolution reflects the core concept of management as the skillful handling of resources and people.
