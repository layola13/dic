词源:

The word "grotesque" ultimately derives from the Italian word "grottesco," which referred to the oddly shaped and often fantastical figures found in Roman grottoes (caves). These figures, often a mixture of human and animal features, were rediscovered during the Renaissance and inspired a style of art and decoration.  The Italian word itself is derived from "grotta," meaning "cave."
