词源:
The word "conductory" derives from the Latin word "conductor," meaning "leader" or "guide," which itself stems from the verb "ducere," meaning "to lead."  The suffix "-ory" indicates a relating to or characterized by a certain quality. In the context of electricity and heat, it refers to the ability to transmit or conduct these forms of energy.
