singspiel:/ˈzɪŋʃpiːl/| n.|轻歌剧；包含歌曲的戏剧|A singspiel is a type of musical play or drama, particularly popular in German-speaking countries in the 18th and 19th centuries, that incorporates songs, often interspersed with spoken dialogue.  Unlike opera, where the entire story is sung, a singspiel features both singing and spoken elements. The songs often advance the plot or express the characters' emotions.|Example: Mozart's *The Abduction from the Seraglio* is a famous example of a singspiel.|近义词：musical play, operetta|反义词：opera (in the sense of a purely sung drama)
