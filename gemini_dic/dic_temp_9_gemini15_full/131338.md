词源：

The word is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "charitable," which derives from the noun "charity."  "Charity" ultimately comes from the Latin word "caritas," meaning "dearness," "fondness," or "love," later evolving to encompass the concepts of goodwill, generosity, and almsgiving.


用法说明：

"Noncharitable" is primarily used to describe actions, behaviors, or attitudes that lack generosity, kindness, or compassion. It suggests a deliberate withholding of help or sympathy, often implying a selfish or mean-spirited motivation.  It's less commonly used to describe a person directly (you'd more likely say "ungenerous" or "selfish"), but can be used to describe a person's actions or disposition.
