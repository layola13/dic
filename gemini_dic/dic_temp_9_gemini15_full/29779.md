WORD ORIGIN->
Cattle comes from the Old English word "ceap," meaning "chattel" or "movable property,"  which evolved into "catel" in Middle English, and finally "cattle."  The word originally referred to any kind of movable property, but gradually came to refer specifically to livestock, and then to cows.
