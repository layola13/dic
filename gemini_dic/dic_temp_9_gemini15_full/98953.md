词源:
The word "inter-county" is a compound word.  "Inter-" is a prefix meaning "between" or "among," derived from Latin "inter." "County" comes from the Old French "counte," ultimately from the Latin "comitatus," meaning "companionship" or "following."  Therefore, "inter-county" literally means "between counties" or "among counties."
