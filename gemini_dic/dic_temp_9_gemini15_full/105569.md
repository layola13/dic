词源:
The word "kind" originates from the Old English word "gecynd," meaning "nature," "race," or "species."  This further traces back to Proto-Germanic roots and ultimately connects to even older Indo-European roots related to concepts of birth and origin.  The evolution of the word reflects a shift from a purely biological or taxonomic sense to encompass the moral and social connotations we associate with "kind" today.
