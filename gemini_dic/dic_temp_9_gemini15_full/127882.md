WORD ORIGIN->

The word "neocortical" is a combination of:

* **neo-**:  A prefix meaning "new" or "recent".  From Greek νέος (neos) meaning "new".
* **cortical**:  Relating to the cortex (the outer layer of an organ, especially the brain). From Latin "cortex" meaning "bark" or "rind".


Therefore, "neocortical" literally means "relating to the new cortex," specifically referring to the newest evolutionary layer of the mammalian brain's cerebral cortex.
