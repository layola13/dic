The word "fluenter" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  If it was intended to be another word, please provide the correct spelling.  I cannot provide a detailed analysis for a word that doesn't exist.
