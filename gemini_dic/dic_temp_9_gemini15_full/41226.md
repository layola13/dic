coralligena: /ˌkɒrælˈɪdʒənə/ | n. |珊瑚礁生物群落|  A diverse and complex marine ecosystem characterized by a framework of calcareous algae and corals, supporting a rich assemblage of plants and animals.  Coralligenous habitats are often found in deeper, less illuminated waters than coral reefs. | Example: The divers explored the vibrant coralligena, teeming with colorful fish and invertebrates.  潜水员探索了充满色彩斑斓的鱼类和无脊椎动物的繁荣珊瑚礁生物群落。 | 近义词:coral reef (though less precise as coralligena encompasses a broader range of organisms and habitats),  submarine forest | 反义词:  open ocean (lacking the structural complexity of coralligena)

词源:  The word "coralligena" is derived from the Latin word "corallum" (coral) and the suffix "-igen", which indicates origin or production.  It literally means "coral-producing" or "coral-generating", though it's not strictly about coral production but rather the habitat built upon and shaped by various calcareous organisms including corals.
