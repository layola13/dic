ftoc:/ˈfɒtɒk/|abbr.|摄氏度到华氏度转换|Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion.  It is an abbreviation often used in programming or scientific contexts to denote a function or process that converts temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius.|Example: The program uses a ftoc function to display the temperature in Celsius.|近义词:CtoF (Celsius to Fahrenheit)|反义词:None

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The ftoc function converts the temperature. = ftoc函数转换温度。
The program runs the ftoc conversion. = 程序运行ftoc转换。


一般过去时:
The ftoc function converted the temperature successfully. = ftoc函数成功转换了温度。
The system performed a ftoc conversion. = 系统执行了ftoc转换。


现在完成时:
The program has completed the ftoc conversion. = 程序已完成ftoc转换。
The software has successfully performed many ftoc conversions. = 该软件已成功执行多次ftoc转换。


过去完成时:
The system had already performed the ftoc conversion before the error occurred. = 在错误发生之前，系统已经执行了ftoc转换。
The program had completed the ftoc conversion before the data was saved. = 在数据保存之前，程序已经完成了ftoc转换。


将来时:
The program will perform a ftoc conversion. = 程序将执行ftoc转换。
The system will automatically run the ftoc conversion. = 系统将自动运行ftoc转换。


虚拟语气:
If the temperature were in Fahrenheit, we would use the ftoc function. = 如果温度是华氏度，我们将使用ftoc函数。
It would be helpful if the ftoc function were more efficient. = 如果ftoc函数更高效，那就太好了。


被动语态:
The temperature was converted by the ftoc function. = 温度由ftoc函数转换。
The ftoc conversion was completed successfully. = ftoc转换成功完成。


疑问句:
Has the ftoc conversion been completed? = ftoc转换完成了吗？
Is the program using the ftoc function correctly? = 程序是否正确使用了ftoc函数？


否定句:
The ftoc function did not convert the temperature correctly. = ftoc函数没有正确转换温度。
The system did not perform the ftoc conversion. = 系统没有执行ftoc转换。


PHRASE->
ftoc function = ftoc 函数
ftoc conversion = ftoc 转换
perform a ftoc conversion = 执行ftoc转换
complete a ftoc conversion = 完成ftoc转换
run the ftoc function = 运行ftoc函数
