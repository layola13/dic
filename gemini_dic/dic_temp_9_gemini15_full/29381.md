词源:
The word "casualty" ultimately derives from the Latin word "casu," meaning "chance" or "accident."  Through Old French ("casualté," meaning "accident, misfortune"), it evolved into its modern English form.  Initially, it referred to an accident or misfortune, but its meaning shifted over time to encompass the victims of accidents or warfare.
