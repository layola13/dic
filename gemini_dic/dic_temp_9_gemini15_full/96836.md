词源:

The word "inevident" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "evident."  "Evident" itself comes from the Old French word "evident," derived from the Latin "evidens," meaning "clear, plain, obvious."  Therefore, "inevident" literally means "not evident" or "not obvious."
