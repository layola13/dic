The word "prismy" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized field.

To help, I need more context. Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the source might help determine its intended meaning and allow for a proper analysis.
