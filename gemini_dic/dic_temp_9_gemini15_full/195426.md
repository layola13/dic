The word "seminationalistic" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism, possibly a blend or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full etymological breakdown and grammatical analysis are impossible.  To provide a response in the requested format would be misleading.

If you intended a different word, or if you can provide context where you encountered this word, I can offer a more helpful analysis.
