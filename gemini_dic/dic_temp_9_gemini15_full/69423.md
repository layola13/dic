词源:  This phrase is a combination of the verb "feel" (expressing a subjective state) and the prepositional phrase "up to," which indicates ability or capacity.  The meaning has developed colloquially over time.  There's no single etymological origin point like a specific historical text or event.  Rather, it's a natural evolution of language.

feel up to the task = 胜任这项任务

not feel up to it = 感觉做不到

feel up to going out = 感觉能够出去

feel up to the challenge = 胜任挑战

feeling up to a long journey = 感觉能够进行长途旅行
