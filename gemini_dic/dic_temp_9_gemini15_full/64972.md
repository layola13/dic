词源:
The word "estimate" comes from the Old French word "estimer," meaning "to esteem, value, appraise."  This in turn derives from the Latin word "aestimare," which combines "ad" (to) and "aestimare" (to value, assess). The meaning evolved from a sense of valuing or judging something to include the more specific sense of making a calculation based on available information.
