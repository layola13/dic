melanterite:/ˌmɛlənˈtaɪraɪt/| n. |绿矾；铁绿矾|A hydrous ferrous sulfate mineral, FeSO₄·7H₂O, typically occurring as efflorescent green crystals.  It is a common secondary mineral formed by the oxidation of pyrite and other iron sulfides.|The sample contained a significant amount of melanterite, indicating the presence of previous pyrite deposits.|近义词：ferrous sulfate (化学名)|反义词：无
