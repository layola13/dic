词源:
The word "emendately" is derived from the verb "emend," meaning "to correct or improve (a text)."  "Emend" comes from the Latin word "emendāre," which combines the prefix "e-" (out, from) and the verb "mendāre" (to repair, amend).  The suffix "-ately" forms an adverb, indicating "in a manner of."  Therefore, "emendately" means "in a manner of correcting or improving," signifying accuracy and precision.
