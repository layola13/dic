The word "dippable's" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a non-standard or invented word, possibly a misspelling or a creative variation.  Therefore, a traditional lexical analysis is not possible.  It likely intends to describe something that can be dipped,  but the "'s" adds an unusual possessive or pluralizing element.  To provide a useful response, we'll need to analyze what the user likely *intended* to write.  Possible intended words include:

**1.  dippable:**

/ˈdɪpəbəl/ | adj. | 可蘸的，适合蘸的 | Able to be dipped into a sauce or other substance.  | Example: "These chicken nuggets are perfectly dippable."  这些鸡块非常适合蘸酱。 |  近义词: dunkable, dipable | 反义词:  undippable (not a common word)


**2.  dips:**

/dɪps/ | n. | 酱料，蘸酱 | A sauce or spread served for dipping food into. | Example: "We have several dips for your nachos." 我们有几种蘸酱可以配你的玉米片。 | 近义词: sauces, spreads | 反义词:  (No direct antonym; context-dependent)

**3.  dip's (possessive):**

/dɪps/ | n. (possessive) | ...的蘸酱 |  Showing possession related to a dip or dips. | Example:  This is the dip's container. 这是蘸酱的容器。(Though grammatically clumsy,  it might be used informally) | 近义词: sauce's, spread's | 反义词: N/A
