sclerogenous:/sklɛˈrɒdʒənəs/| adj. |硬化组织的；产生硬组织的 | Relating to or characterized by the production of hard tissues, especially sclerenchyma in plants.  The term often describes structures or tissues that are rigid and supportive due to the presence of sclerenchyma cells.| Example: The sclerogenous cells in the plant's stem provided structural support.|近义词：rigid, hard, stiff, strong |反义词：soft, flexible, pliable
