The word "fata" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word.  If you can provide the intended word or context, I can provide the analysis.
* **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name (personal, place, or brand) or a specific term within a particular field.  More context is needed.
* **It's a word from another language:**  It could be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.  Specifying the language of origin would be helpful.

Please clarify the word or provide more context.
