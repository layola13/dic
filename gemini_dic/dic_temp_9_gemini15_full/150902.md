parallax:/ˈpærəlæks/| n.|视差，视差法|The apparent displacement of an object when viewed from different positions.  It's often used in astronomy to measure the distance to stars.|例句：By measuring the parallax of a star, astronomers can determine its distance from Earth. 通过测量恒星的视差，天文学家可以确定它与地球的距离。|例句：The parallax effect is noticeable when looking at nearby objects from different viewpoints. 从不同的角度看附近的物体时，视差效应很明显。|近义词：displacement, shift|反义词：None specifically.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The parallax of that star is being measured. = 正在测量那颗恒星的视差。
This method uses parallax to calculate distance. = 此方法利用视差来计算距离。

一般过去时:
Astronomers used parallax to determine the distance to the star. = 天文学家利用视差来确定到那颗恒星的距离。
The parallax was calculated using trigonometric methods. = 视差是使用三角法计算的。

现在完成时:
Scientists have used parallax to map the nearby stars. = 科学家们已经利用视差来绘制附近恒星的地图。
We have observed a significant parallax shift. = 我们观察到一个显著的视差偏移。

过去完成时:
Before the invention of parallax methods, distances were harder to measure. = 在发明视差法之前，距离更难测量。
They had already calculated the parallax before presenting their findings. = 他们在提交研究结果之前就已经计算出视差了。

将来时:
Astronomers will use advanced techniques to measure parallax more accurately. = 天文学家将使用先进的技术来更精确地测量视差。
We will need to account for parallax in our observations. = 我们需要在我们的观测中考虑视差。

虚拟语气:
If we had a more precise instrument, we could measure parallax more accurately. = 如果我们有更精确的仪器，我们可以更精确地测量视差。
It would be easier to calculate distance if parallax were the only factor. = 如果视差是唯一因素，计算距离会更容易。

被动语态:
Parallax is used to determine the distance to celestial objects. = 视差用于确定到天体的距离。
The parallax shift was carefully measured by the research team. = 视差偏移由研究团队仔细测量。

疑问句:
What is the parallax of that distant galaxy? = 那遥远星系的视差是多少？
How significant is the parallax effect in this experiment? = 在这个实验中视差效应有多显著？

否定句:
The parallax was not significant enough for accurate measurement. = 视差不足以进行精确测量。
We did not consider parallax in our initial calculations. = 我们在最初的计算中没有考虑视差。
