microseismometer:/ˈmaɪkroʊˈsaɪzmɑːmɪtər/ | n. | 微震仪 | A microseismometer is a highly sensitive instrument used to detect and measure extremely small seismic waves, often those too weak to be felt by humans.  These instruments are crucial for studying various geological phenomena, including microseisms, which are background vibrations of the Earth. | Example: Scientists used a microseismometer array to monitor subtle ground movements associated with volcanic activity.  科学家们使用微震仪阵列来监测与火山活动相关的细微地面运动。 | 近义词：seismometer (less sensitive) | 反义词：None (antonyms are not applicable here as it describes a type of instrument) | 词性:名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun, so verb conjugations are not applicable.  However, we can illustrate its use in different sentence structures.

一般现在时:
The microseismometer records the subtle vibrations. = 微震仪记录着细微的震动。
This microseismometer is highly sensitive. = 这台微震仪非常灵敏。


一般过去时:
The microseismometer detected a small earthquake. = 微震仪探测到一次小地震。
The scientists calibrated the microseismometer before the experiment. = 科学家们在实验前校准了微震仪。


现在完成时:
The microseismometer has recorded several microseisms today. = 微震仪今天已经记录了几次微震。
They have installed a new microseismometer in the observatory. = 他们在天文台安装了一台新的微震仪。


过去完成时:
The microseismometer had already detected the tremor before the alarm sounded. = 警报响起之前，微震仪就已经探测到了震动。
The data showed that the microseismometer had malfunctioned during the storm. = 数据显示，微震仪在风暴期间出现故障。


将来时:
The researchers will use the microseismometer to monitor the fault line. = 研究人员将使用微震仪监测断层线。
We will install a more advanced microseismometer next year. = 我们明年将安装一台更先进的微震仪。


被动语态:
The microseismometer was carefully calibrated. = 微震仪经过仔细校准。
The data from the microseismometer is being analyzed. = 微震仪的数据正在被分析。


疑问句:
Is the microseismometer functioning properly? = 微震仪运行正常吗？
What type of microseismometer is used in this study? = 这项研究中使用了哪种类型的微震仪？


否定句:
The microseismometer did not detect any significant seismic activity. = 微震仪没有探测到任何明显的震动活动。
The old microseismometer is no longer in use. = 旧的微震仪不再使用了。


PHRASE->
There are limited common phrases directly involving "microseismometer" due to its specialized nature.  Instead, we can illustrate common phrases used *with* microseismometers:

microseismometer array: 微震仪阵列
microseismometer data: 微震仪数据
microseismometer calibration: 微震仪校准
microseismometer sensitivity: 微震仪灵敏度
microseismometer installation: 微震仪安装


词源:
The word "microseismometer" is a compound word.  It combines:

* **micro-**:  From Greek "mikros," meaning "small."
* **seismo-**: From Greek "seismos," meaning "earthquake" or "shaking."
* **-meter**: From Greek "-metron," meaning "measure."


Therefore, "microseismometer" literally means an instrument that measures small earthquakes or earth vibrations.
