词源:
The word "nitpicking" is a compound word.  "Nit" originally referred to a louse egg, and "picking" means selecting or choosing.  The implication is that someone is meticulously examining something insignificant, like picking through nits (lice eggs).  The figurative meaning evolved to describe the act of focusing on insignificant details and finding faults in them.
