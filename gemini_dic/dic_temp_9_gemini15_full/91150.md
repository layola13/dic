hydantoin:/haɪˈdæn.toʊɪn/| n. |乙内酰脲|A heterocyclic organic compound containing a five-membered ring with two carbonyl groups and two nitrogen atoms.|Hydantoins are used in the synthesis of various pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals.  They are also found in some naturally occurring substances.|近义词：glycolylurea|反义词：无


例句：

The synthesis of this hydantoin derivative is described in detail in the literature. = 这种乙内酰脲衍生物的合成在文献中已有详细描述。

This research focuses on the application of hydantoins in medicinal chemistry. = 这项研究侧重于乙内酰脲在药物化学中的应用。


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb or adjective forms in common usage.  Therefore, tense conjugations, passive voice, etc., are not applicable to the word "hydantoin" itself.  It can be used as a part of a larger phrase that might use these grammatical forms, but the word itself doesn't change.  For example:


PHRASE->
5-methylhydantoin = 5-甲基乙内酰脲
hydantoin derivatives = 乙内酰脲衍生物
phenylhydantoin  = 苯妥英
hydantoin ring = 乙内酰脲环
substituted hydantoin = 取代乙内酰脲


词源：

The name "hydantoin" is derived from its chemical structure and synthesis.  It's a combination of elements reflecting its composition:  "hydro-" (referencing hydrogen),  "-anto-" (likely related to the presence of nitrogen and carbonyl groups, and possibly alluding to related compounds) and "-in" (a common suffix for heterocyclic compounds).  The exact historical etymology requires deeper investigation into the chemical literature of the time of its discovery.
