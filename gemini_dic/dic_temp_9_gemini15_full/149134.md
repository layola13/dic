词源:  Derived from "oxidize," which itself comes from "oxygen" (from Greek *ὀξύς (oxýs) "sharp, acid, pointed" + -γενής (-genēs) "producing") + "-ize" (a suffix forming verbs meaning "to cause to become").  The "-ing" suffix transforms the verb into a present participle, functioning as an adjective.
