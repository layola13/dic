词源:

The word is formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or too much) and the adjective "inhibited," which itself comes from the verb "inhibit" (to restrain, hinder, or prevent).  "Inhibit" has Latin roots, tracing back to *inhibere*, from *in-* (in) + *habēre* (to have, hold).  Therefore, "overinhibited" literally means "excessively held back" or "excessively restrained."
