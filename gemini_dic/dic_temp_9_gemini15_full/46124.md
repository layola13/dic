Etymology:

The word "cymbal" comes from the Middle English "cymbale," which in turn derives from the Old French "cimballe."  This ultimately traces back to the Late Latin "cymbalum," a borrowing from the Greek "κύμβαλον" (kymbalon). The Greek word likely originated from a Semitic root, possibly related to words meaning "cup" or "bowl," reflecting the cymbal's shape.
