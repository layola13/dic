词源：

The word "holdover" comes from the verb "hold over," meaning to continue or postpone.  The prefix "hold" signifies retaining or maintaining, and "over" indicates continuation beyond a certain point.  Its origins trace back to Middle English, evolving from the Old English verb "haldan," meaning "to hold."  The "-over" suffix contributes the sense of continuation or delay.
