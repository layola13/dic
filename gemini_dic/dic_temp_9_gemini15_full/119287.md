词源:

* **micro-**:  From Greek *mikros* meaning "small."
* **electro-**: From Greek *elektron* meaning "amber" (historically associated with static electricity).
* **phoresis**: From Greek *phorēsis* meaning "carrying," "bearing," or "a carrying."  This refers to the movement of particles.
* **-tic**:  Adjectival suffix indicating "relating to" or "characterized by."

Therefore, "micro-electrophoretic" literally means "relating to the carrying of small particles by electricity."
