fluxions:/ˈflʌkʃənz/ | n. |微积分，流量，变动 |The term "fluxions" refers to Newton's method of calculating derivatives, which predates Leibniz's notation of calculus.  It involves considering the rate of change of a variable as an infinitely small increment.  The term is largely obsolete in modern mathematics, replaced by the more common term "calculus". | Example: Newton's method of fluxions was a significant contribution to the development of calculus. 牛顿的微积分方法对微积分的发展做出了重大贡献。|近义词：calculus, derivatives, rates of change |反义词：static state, constancy


USAGE->
(由于fluxions本身是名词，且为过时术语，没有常见动词用法，因此不提供动词时态变化例句)


PHRASE->
rate of fluxions: 微分的速率
method of fluxions: 牛顿的微积分方法
infinitesimal fluxions: 无穷小微分
fluxion of a curve: 曲线的微分
application of fluxions: 微积分的应用
