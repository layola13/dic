词源:

The word "overrefinements" is a compound word.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "too much" or "excessively," and "refinement" refers to the process of improving something by making small changes.  Refinement itself comes from the Old French word "refinement," ultimately deriving from the Latin "re-finire," meaning "to finish again" or "to perfect."  Therefore, overrefinement signifies an excessive degree of perfecting, often to the detriment of the original purpose or natural quality.
