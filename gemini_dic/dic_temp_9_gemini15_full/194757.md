selkie:/ˈsɛlki/| n. |海豹人，海豹女；能变身成海豹的人|A selkie is a mythological creature, typically from Scottish and Irish folklore, that can shapeshift between a seal and a human form.  Selkies are often depicted as beautiful women who shed their seal skin to become human, and sometimes fall in love with humans. The seal skin is usually hidden by the human lover and the selkie is thus prevented from returning to the sea. |Example: The legend of the selkie captivated the children.|近义词：merperson, shapeshifter |反义词：None (No direct antonym exists)|名词
