calcinable:/ˈkælsɪnəbl/| adj.| 可煅烧的；可焙烧的 | Capable of being calcined; able to undergo calcination.  Calcination is a process of heating a solid material to a high temperature, typically to cause a change of phase or to remove volatile components. | Example: Limestone is a calcinable material often used in cement production. 石灰石是一种可煅烧的材料，常用于水泥生产。 The ore is calcinable at relatively low temperatures.  这种矿石在相对较低的温度下即可煅烧。 | 近义词：burnable, combustible | 反义词：incalcinable
