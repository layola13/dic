词源:

paintbrush is a compound word combining "paint" and "brush".  The 's' is a standard English possessive suffix.

"Paint" comes from the Old French "peindre" meaning "to paint," ultimately from the Latin "pingere" with the same meaning.

"Brush" comes from the Old English "brūsian," meaning "to brush," related to the Old High German "brūsen" meaning "to touch lightly."
