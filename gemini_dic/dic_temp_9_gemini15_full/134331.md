/ˌnɑːnˈɪnsjʊleɪtərz/ | n. | 非绝缘体 | Noninsulators are materials that allow electricity to flow through them relatively easily. They are the opposite of insulators.  | Example: Metals are good examples of noninsulators. 金属是良好的非绝缘体例子。  Many semiconductors can act as noninsulators under certain conditions.许多半导体在特定条件下可以充当非绝缘体。|近义词: conductors |反义词: insulators


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Metals conduct electricity. = 金属导电。
This wire carries a current. = 这根电线通电。


一般过去时:
The circuit failed because the noninsulator broke. = 电路失效是因为非绝缘体坏了。
The current flowed through the material. = 电流流过了材料。


现在完成时:
The experiment has proven that this material is a noninsulator. = 实验已经证明这种材料是非绝缘体。
We have observed the conductivity of several noninsulator samples. = 我们已经观察了几种非绝缘体样品的导电性。


过去完成时:
Before the failure, the noninsulator had been working perfectly. = 在故障之前，非绝缘体工作得很好。
The current had already flowed before the switch was turned off. = 在开关关闭之前，电流已经流过了。


将来时:
This new material will be a better noninsulator than the previous one. = 这种新型材料将比以前的材料成为更好的非绝缘体。
We will test the conductivity of the noninsulator tomorrow. = 我们明天将测试非绝缘体的导电性。


虚拟语气:
If this were a perfect noninsulator, the current flow would be even higher. = 如果这是完美的非绝缘体，电流会更大。
I wish I had known that material was a noninsulator earlier. = 我真希望我早知道那种材料是非绝缘体。


被动语态:
The electricity was conducted by the noninsulator. = 电流由非绝缘体传导。
The experiment was conducted to test the noninsulator's properties. = 进行实验是为了测试非绝缘体的特性。


疑问句:
Is this material a noninsulator? = 这种材料是非绝缘体吗？
What type of noninsulator is used in this device? = 这个设备使用了哪种类型的非绝缘体？


否定句:
This material is not a good noninsulator. = 这种材料不是一个好的非绝缘体。
The circuit didn't work because the noninsulator was faulty. = 电路失灵是因为非绝缘体故障了。


PHRASE->
good noninsulator  好的非绝缘体
electrical noninsulator 电气非绝缘体
thermal noninsulator 热非绝缘体
perfect noninsulator  完美的非绝缘体
types of noninsulators  非绝缘体的类型
