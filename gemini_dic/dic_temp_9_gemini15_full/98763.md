词源:

The word "intake" comes from the Old English word "in", meaning "in," and "take," meaning "to take."  It's a combination of a preposition and a verb, forming a noun that signifies the act of taking something in.  The meaning has evolved over time to encompass various contexts, including the amount taken in and the place where something is taken in (like an intake valve).
