词源:
The word "non-sympathetic" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "sympathetic" (meaning "feeling or showing sympathy").  "Sympathetic" itself originates from the Greek word "sympatheia," meaning "fellow feeling" or "shared emotion," composed of "syn-" (together) and "pathos" (suffering, feeling).
