The word "objicient" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no recognized pronunciation, definition, etymology, or usage.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a very specialized or obscure field, or a made-up word.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis according to the given format.
