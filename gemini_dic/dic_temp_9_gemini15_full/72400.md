fluence:/ˈfluːəns/| n.| 流量；影响；流畅性 |The total amount of energy or particles passing through a unit area in a unit of time. It is often used in physics to describe the flow of particles or energy.| 例句：The fluence of the laser beam was carefully controlled. 激光束的通量受到仔细控制。  The fluence of the radiation affected the experiment's results. 辐射的通量影响了实验的结果。|近义词：flux, flow, impact |反义词：stagnation, inertia |名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The fluence of the laser is high. = 激光的通量很高。
Neutron fluence is measured in particles per square centimeter. = 中子通量以每平方厘米的粒子数来衡量。


一般过去时:
The fluence of the X-rays was lower than expected. = X射线的通量低于预期。
The high fluence damaged the sensor. = 高通量损坏了传感器。


现在完成时:
Scientists have measured the fluence of cosmic rays. = 科学家们已经测量了宇宙射线的通量。
We have observed a significant increase in particle fluence. = 我们观察到粒子通量显着增加。


过去完成时:
The experiment had already begun before the fluence was adjusted. = 在调整通量之前，实验已经开始了。
They had underestimated the fluence of the particle beam. = 他们低估了粒子束的通量。


将来时:
The fluence will be monitored throughout the experiment. = 在整个实验过程中都会监测通量。
We will increase the fluence to optimize the results. = 我们将增加通量以优化结果。


虚拟语气:
If the fluence were higher, the reaction would be faster. = 如果通量更高，反应会更快。
I wish the fluence had been more stable during the experiment. = 我希望实验期间通量更稳定。


被动语态:
The fluence was carefully calculated by the researchers. = 通量由研究人员仔细计算。
The fluence is often measured using specialized detectors. = 通量通常使用专用探测器进行测量。


疑问句:
What is the fluence of the electron beam? = 电子束的通量是多少？
How was the fluence determined in this study? = 本研究是如何确定通量的？


否定句:
The fluence was not high enough to initiate the reaction. = 通量不足以引发反应。
There was no significant change in the fluence over time. = 通量随时间没有发生显著变化。


PHRASE->
