detectibilities:/dɪˌtɛktəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可检测性；可探测性 | The ability to be detected or measured.  It refers to the extent to which something can be reliably detected or measured, often considering the limitations of the detection method.  The higher the detectibility, the easier it is to detect the target. | 例句：The detectibility of the signal was low due to background noise.  信号的可检测性由于背景噪声而较低。


The detectibilities of different pollutants vary widely depending on the analytical techniques employed.  不同污染物的可检测性因所采用的分析技术而差异很大。 | 近义词：detectability, measurability | 反义词：undetectability, inmeasurability


词源:

The word "detectibilities" is derived from the verb "detect," which comes from the Latin word "detectus," the past participle of "detegere," meaning "to uncover" or "to reveal."  The suffix "-ible" indicates capability or possibility, and the further suffix "-ity" transforms it into a noun signifying a quality or state.  Therefore, "detectibilities" refers to the different levels or qualities of being detectable.
