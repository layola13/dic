词源:
The word "ruckus" is of uncertain origin, but it's likely an alteration of the earlier word "ruck," meaning a "heap" or "crowd," possibly from Dutch or German roots. The addition of "-us" may be an attempt to create a more boisterous or emphatic sound.  The word evolved to describe the noisy and chaotic behavior associated with a large and disorganized group.
