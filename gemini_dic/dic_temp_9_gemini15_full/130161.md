non-restricting: /ˌnɑːn rɪˈstrɪktɪŋ/ | adj. | 非限制性的 |  Describes a phrase or clause that adds extra information to a sentence but is not essential to the meaning of the main clause.  It is set off by commas, dashes, or parentheses.  Unlike restrictive clauses, removing a non-restrictive clause does not change the core meaning of the sentence. |
