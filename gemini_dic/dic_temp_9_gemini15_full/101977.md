isochasm:/ˈaɪsəʊkæzəm/| n. |等深线，等值线|A line on a map connecting points of equal magnetic declination.  Isochasms are used in geomagnetism to represent areas with the same magnetic variation.|Example: The map showed several isochasms indicating varying degrees of magnetic declination.|近义词：isoline, contour line|反义词：无


USAGE->
This word is a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "what".  Therefore, tense conjugations are not applicable.  Here are examples of its use in different sentence structures:


A simple sentence:
The isochasm on the map clearly marked the area of magnetic anomaly. = 地图上的等深线清楚地标明了磁异常区域。


A complex sentence:
Because the isochasm shifted, scientists revised their understanding of the Earth's magnetic field. = 由于等深线发生了偏移，科学家们修正了他们对地球磁场的理解。


A sentence with a prepositional phrase:
Using the isochasm data, researchers created a three-dimensional model of the subsurface geology. = 利用等深线数据，研究人员创建了地下地质的三维模型。


A sentence with a relative clause:
The isochasm, which represents a line of equal magnetic declination, is a crucial tool for navigators. = 等深线代表等磁偏角线，是导航员的重要工具。

A sentence in passive voice:
The area of interest was clearly defined by the isochasm. = 感兴趣的区域由等深线清晰地界定。


A sentence in a question format:
What does the isochasm indicate in this region? = 这个区域的等深线表示什么？


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "isochasm" as it is a highly specialized term.  However, it's often used in conjunction with phrases like:


"isochasm map" = 等深线图
"magnetic isochasm" = 磁等深线
"isochasm analysis" = 等深线分析
"isochasm pattern" = 等深线模式
"isochasm distribution" = 等深线分布
