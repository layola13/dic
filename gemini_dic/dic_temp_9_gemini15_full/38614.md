It's a solid mass formed by the precipitation of minerals from solution. Concretions can vary greatly in size, shape, and composition. | Example: The geologist discovered several interesting concretions embedded in the sandstone.  地质学家在砂岩中发现了一些有趣的结核。 The concretion of ideas into a coherent theory took years of research.  将思想具体化成一个连贯的理论花费了数年的研究。|近义词： nodule, aggregation, lump |反义词： dispersion, scattering
