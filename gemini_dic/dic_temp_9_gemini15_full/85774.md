The word "hayey" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a regional dialect word, or a newly coined term. If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more informed response.
