photoluminescent:/ˌfoʊtoʊˌluːməˈnɛsənt/ | adj. | 发光的，光致发光的 |  Emitting light as a result of absorbing radiation (typically ultraviolet or visible light).  The emission continues as long as the material is illuminated.  | Example: The paint is photoluminescent, glowing brightly in the dark after being exposed to sunlight.  这涂料是光致发光的，在暴露于阳光下后会在黑暗中发出明亮的光。 | 近义词:phosphorescent, luminescent | 反义词:non-luminescent
