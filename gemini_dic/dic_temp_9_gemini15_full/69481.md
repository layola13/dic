feldspars:/ˈfɛldˌspɑːrz/| n. |长石|Feldspars are a group of rock-forming tectosilicate minerals that make up as much as 60% of the Earth's crust. They are characterized by a three-dimensional framework of linked silica (SiO4) tetrahedra, with some of the silicon atoms replaced by aluminum atoms.  This substitution creates a negative charge that is balanced by the presence of alkali metals (such as potassium, sodium) or alkaline earth metals (such as calcium, barium).  Different feldspars are distinguished by their chemical composition and crystal structure.|The granite countertop is primarily composed of feldspars.|近义词：silicates|反义词：无
