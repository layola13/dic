nonabstractnesses:/ˌnɒnæbˈstræktnəsɪz/ | n. |非抽象性，具体性 | The word "nonabstractnesses" refers to the qualities or characteristics that are concrete, tangible, and not theoretical or conceptual. It is the plural form of "nonabstractness".  It's a relatively uncommon word, often used in philosophical or academic contexts to highlight the emphasis on the concrete aspects of something.  |The professor emphasized the nonabstractnesses of the experiment, focusing on the tangible results rather than theoretical implications.  教授强调了实验的具体性，侧重于切实的成果而非理论意义。| concreteness, tangibility, reality | abstractness, theory, idealism | 名词


USAGE->

This word is so uncommon that providing grammatical examples across tenses is impractical.  Its usage is essentially limited to describing the existence of concrete qualities, and therefore tense conjugation is not meaningfully applicable in the same way as with common verbs or nouns.  The focus would be on the descriptive use within a sentence.

Example 1:  The artist's work, despite its symbolism, is grounded in the nonabstractnesses of the human form.  这位艺术家的作品，尽管带有象征意义，却扎根于人体的具体形态。

Example 2:  The scientific method prioritizes observation and the documentation of nonabstractnesses over abstract speculation. 科学方法优先考虑观察和记录具体事实，而不是抽象的推测。


PHRASE->

Because "nonabstractnesses" is a relatively uncommon and complex word,  it doesn't have common idiomatic phrases associated with it.  Phrases would be built around the concept rather than the word itself. For example:


focus on the concrete, emphasize the tangible, deal with realities,  ground in reality,  avoid abstraction
