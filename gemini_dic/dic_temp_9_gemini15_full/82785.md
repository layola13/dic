词源:
The word "guilty" originates from the Old English word "gylt," meaning "guilt, sin, or offense."  This in turn likely derives from Proto-Germanic *gultō, also meaning "guilt" or "payment."  The modern meaning evolved over time to encompass both the legal sense of being judged culpable and the emotional state of remorse or shame.
