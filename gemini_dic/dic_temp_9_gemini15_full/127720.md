词源:
The word "negligence" comes from the Old French word "negligence," which in turn derives from the Latin word "negligentia," meaning "neglect," "carelessness," or "heedlessness."  The Latin word is formed from "negligens," the present participle of "negligo," meaning "I neglect" or "I disregard."  The prefix "neg-" means "not" and the root "-lig-" is related to the word "lect" (to choose or gather), implying a failure to choose or attend to something.
