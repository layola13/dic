词源:
The word "imbed" comes from the Old English word "imbeddan," which itself is a combination of the prefix "in-" (meaning "in" or "into") and the verb "beddan" (meaning "to make a bed" or "to lay").  The original meaning thus involved placing something firmly into a resting place, much like bedding down. Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the current sense of fixing something firmly within a surrounding mass.
