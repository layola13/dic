The word "overdogmatisms" is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessive or too much) and "dogmatisms" (the plural of dogmatism).  "Dogmatism" itself originates from the Greek word "dogma" (δόγμα), meaning "opinion," "belief," or "doctrine."  The suffix "-ism" denotes a system of beliefs or principles.
