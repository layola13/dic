词源:

The word "overscrupulosity" is derived from the adjective "scrupulous," which comes from the Latin word "scrupulus," meaning "a small sharp stone" or "a qualm of conscience."  The prefix "over-" signifies "excessive" or "too much."  Therefore, "overscrupulosity" literally means "excessive conscientiousness" or "excessive carefulness to the point of being problematic."
