plastid:/ˈplæstɪd/| n.|质体|A plastid is a membrane-bound organelle found in the cells of plants and algae.  Plastids are responsible for manufacturing and storing food.  Different types of plastids exist, each with a specific function. For example, chloroplasts are plastids that contain chlorophyll and carry out photosynthesis.|Example: Chloroplasts are a type of plastid that is crucial for photosynthesis in plants.|近义词：organelle (in a broader sense)|反义词：None|名词

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The plant cell contains many plastids. = 植物细胞含有许多质体。
This plastid is responsible for starch storage. = 这个质体负责淀粉储存。


一般过去时:
Scientists studied the plastids under a microscope. = 科学家们在显微镜下研究了质体。
The experiment showed how the plastids developed. = 实验展示了质体是如何发育的。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several types of plastids. = 研究人员已经鉴定了几种类型的质体。
The scientists have shown how plastids contribute to plant growth. = 科学家们已经展示了质体如何促进植物生长。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had prepared the plastids carefully. = 在实验之前，他们已经仔细地准备了质体。
The researchers had already observed similar plastids in other species. = 研究人员已经在其他物种中观察到类似的质体。


将来时:
We will examine the plastids further next week. = 我们下周将进一步检查质体。
They will analyze the function of these plastids. = 他们将分析这些质体的功能。


虚拟语气:
If the plastids were damaged, the plant would die. = 如果质体受损，植物就会死亡。

疑问句:
What types of plastids are found in algae? = 在藻类中发现了哪些类型的质体？
How many plastids are typically found in a plant cell? = 一个植物细胞中通常有多少个质体？


否定句:
The plant cell did not contain any chloroplasts. = 植物细胞不包含任何叶绿体。（Chloroplasts are a type of plastid）
This experiment did not show any significant changes in the plastids. = 此实验没有显示质体的任何重大变化。
