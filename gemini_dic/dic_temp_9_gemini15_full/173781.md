词性:形容词


词源:  The word is a combination of "quasi," from Latin *quasi ("as if," "almost," "nearly"), and "peaceful," from "peace" (Old English *pēace, from Latin *pax) + "-ful" (a suffix forming adjectives meaning "full of," "characterized by").  Thus, "quasi-peaceful" literally means "almost peaceful" or "resembling peace."
