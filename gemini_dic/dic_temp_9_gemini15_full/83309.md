The word "gynno" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  If you can provide the context in which you encountered this word, it might help determine the intended word.

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a technical term within a specific field, or slang used within a particular community.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.


Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis. Please clarify the spelling or provide the context where you saw this word.
