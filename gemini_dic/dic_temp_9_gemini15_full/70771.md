词源:  The word "finest" is the superlative form of the adjective "fine."  "Fine" ultimately derives from the Latin word "finis," meaning "end" or "limit."  In its early usage in English, "fine" meant "refined," "subtle," or "delicate," gradually evolving to encompass meanings of "excellent" and "superior." The "-est" suffix indicates the superlative degree, signifying the highest degree of quality.
