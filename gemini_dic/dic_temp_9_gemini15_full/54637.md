词源:

The word "dismissive" comes from the verb "dismiss," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "desmettre," meaning "to put away, remove, or discharge."  The prefix "dis-" adds a negative or reversing sense, resulting in the meaning of "to reject" or "to disregard."  The suffix "-ive" transforms the verb into an adjective, indicating a characteristic or quality.
