词源:
The word "normalize" is derived from the word "norm," meaning a standard or model, combined with the suffix "-ize," which indicates to make or cause to be.  The word "norm" itself has Latin roots, ultimately stemming from the Latin word "norma," meaning "carpenter's square," "rule," or "pattern."  Therefore, "normalize" essentially means "to make something conform to a standard or rule."
