pentastich: /ˈpɛntəstɪk/| n. |五行诗| A pentastich is a five-line stanza or poem.  It doesn't have a rigidly defined meter or rhyme scheme, unlike some other poetic forms like sonnets or haikus. The structure and style can vary greatly depending on the poet's choice. | Example:  The rain falls soft, a gentle sound, / Upon the leaves, a whispered plea, / The world is hushed, a peaceful ground, / Where weary souls find sanctuary, / And quiet hope begins to be. |近义词：five-line stanza, quintet (in the context of a five-line stanza)|反义词：None specifically, but could be contrasted with longer poetic forms.


USAGE->

PHRASE->
(N/A -  Pentastich itself doesn't form common phrases.  Phrases would relate to the *content* of pentastichs, not the word itself)
