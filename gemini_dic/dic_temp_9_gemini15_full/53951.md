词源:
The word "discover" comes from the Old French word "descouvrir," which itself is a combination of the prefix "des-" (meaning "un-," "away from," or "off") and the verb "couvrir" (meaning "to cover").  Therefore, the original meaning literally implied "to uncover" or "to reveal."  This etymology reflects the core meaning of the word, which is to bring something hidden or unknown into the light.
