cdna:/ˈsiːdiːɛneɪ/| n. |互补DNA；cDNA|Complementary DNA (cDNA) is DNA synthesized from a single-stranded RNA (e.g., messenger RNA or mRNA) template in a process called reverse transcription.  It is often used in molecular biology to express a specific gene in a host organism or to produce a specific protein.|例句：Scientists used cDNA cloning to express the human insulin gene in bacteria.  科学家们利用cDNA克隆技术在大肠杆菌中表达人类胰岛素基因。|近义词：reverse-transcribed DNA|反义词：genomic DNA

(由于cdna本身是名词，没有动词用法，以下例句展示的是关于cdna的用法)

一般现在时:
cDNA is used to study gene expression. = cDNA被用来研究基因表达。
The researchers are creating a cDNA library. = 研究人员正在创建cDNA文库。


一般过去时:
They synthesized cDNA from mRNA. = 他们从mRNA合成cDNA。
The experiment used a cDNA probe. = 实验使用了cDNA探针。


现在完成时:
Scientists have successfully cloned many genes using cDNA. = 科学家们已经成功地利用cDNA克隆了许多基因。
Researchers have identified several novel genes via cDNA sequencing. = 研究人员通过cDNA测序鉴定了几个新的基因。


过去完成时:
They had prepared the cDNA before starting the PCR. = 他们在开始PCR之前已经准备好了cDNA。

They will generate a cDNA library from the tissue sample. = 他们将从组织样本中生成一个cDNA文库。


虚拟语气:
If we had more cDNA, we could perform more experiments. = 如果我们有更多的cDNA，我们就可以进行更多的实验。
It would be helpful if the cDNA was of high quality. = 如果cDNA质量高的话，将会有帮助。


被动语态:
The cDNA was amplified by PCR. = cDNA通过PCR扩增。
The cDNA library is being analyzed. = cDNA文库正在被分析。


疑问句:
What is the purity of the cDNA? = cDNA的纯度是多少？
How much cDNA did you obtain? = 你获得了多少cDNA？


否定句:
The cDNA did not amplify properly. = cDNA没有被正确扩增。
We did not find the target gene in the cDNA library. = 我们在cDNA文库中没有找到目标基因。



PHRASE->
cDNA library = cDNA文库
cDNA cloning = cDNA克隆
