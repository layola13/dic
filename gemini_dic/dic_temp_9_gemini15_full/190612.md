词源:
The word "saturator" derives from the verb "saturate," which comes from the Latin word "saturare," meaning "to fill," "to stuff," or "to load."  The suffix "-ator" is an agent suffix, indicating a person or thing that performs the action of the verb.  Therefore, a "saturator" is a device that performs the action of saturating.
