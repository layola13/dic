The word "romist" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage examples cannot be provided.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, a word used within a specific community or subculture, or slang not yet widely recognized.  More context is needed.
3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name (person, place, or thing) rather than a common word.

To help me provide the requested analysis, please provide more context where you encountered this word.  For example:

* The sentence or phrase where it appeared.
