词源:

The word "purveyor" comes from the Old French word "pourveoir," meaning "to provide" or "to supply."  This ultimately derives from the Latin "providere," which has the same meaning.  The "-or" suffix is a common agent noun suffix in English, indicating the person or thing that performs the action.
