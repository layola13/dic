词源:
The word "heathlike" is a compound word formed from "heath" + "-like".  "Heath" refers to a type of open uncultivated land with low-lying shrubs, especially of the genus *Calluna* (heather). The suffix "-like" means "resembling" or "having the characteristics of."  Therefore, "heathlike" describes something that resembles or shares characteristics with heath.
