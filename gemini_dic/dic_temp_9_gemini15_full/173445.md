词源:
The word "quasi-exactly" is a combination of "quasi" and "exactly".  "Quasi" comes from Latin, meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."  "Exactly" is from the Old French "exactement," ultimately derived from Latin roots meaning "to weigh out."  Therefore, "quasi-exactly" means "almost exactly" or "approximately exactly."
