词源:
From Middle English *impresten, from Old French emprester "to lend, borrow," from Vulgar Latin *impræstare, from Latin imprimere "to impress, stamp," from in- "in, on" + premere "to press."  The modern sense of "advance of money" developed from the idea of money being "pressed" into someone's hands.
