The word "re-spaces" is not a standard English word found in dictionaries.  It appears to be a newly coined or informal term, possibly a combination of "re-" (again, anew) and "spaces" (intervals, gaps).  Therefore, a full etymological breakdown and grammatical analysis are not possible.  However, we can speculate on its potential meaning and usage based on its constituent parts.

/riːˈspeɪsɪz/ | adj. v. n. |重新安排空间；重新划分空间；重新分配空间 |  "Re-spaces" likely describes the action of reorganizing or re-allocating spaces, either physically or abstractly.  It could refer to the rearrangement of furniture in a room, the redistribution of data in a computer system, or the restructuring of a schedule or timetable.
