freebases: /ˈfriːbeɪsɪz/ | v. |  游离碱化；（尤指吸食）纯净的毒品 | To convert (a substance, especially a drug) into its free base form.  This often involves a chemical process to remove acidic components, resulting in a more potent and smokable form.  It's particularly associated with the preparation of illicit drugs for consumption. | 例句：He freebased the cocaine. 他把可卡因制成游离碱形式吸食。  They were arrested for freebasing heroin. 他们因吸食海洛因游离碱而被捕。 | 近义词：smoke (in the context of drug use), vaporize | 反义词：None directly opposite, but the opposite action would be to convert from freebase form to a salt form.
