词源:
From Old French *entreteiner, from entre- “between” + tenir “to hold”.  The original meaning was "to hold between," implying maintaining a relationship or keeping something in mind.  The modern meaning evolved from this, encompassing both the hospitable treatment of guests and the holding of thoughts or ideas.
