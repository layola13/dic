词源:  The word "macrocosmical" is derived from the Greek words "makros" (μακρός), meaning "large" or "great," and "kosmos" (κόσμος), meaning "world" or "universe."  The suffix "-ical" indicates an adjective.  The term reflects the ancient philosophical concept of the macrocosm (the universe) and the microcosm (a smaller, often representative system, like a human being).  The idea is that the smaller system mirrors or reflects the larger one.
