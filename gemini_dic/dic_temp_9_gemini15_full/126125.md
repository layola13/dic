mutexes:/ˈmjuːtɛksɪz/ | n. |互斥锁，互斥体 |  A mutex (mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive that is used to protect shared resources from concurrent access by multiple threads or processes.  It ensures that only one thread or process can access the resource at any given time, preventing race conditions and data corruption.  Mutexes are typically implemented using system calls or library functions provided by the operating system. | Example:  The program uses a mutex to protect access to the shared counter variable.  程序使用互斥锁来保护对共享计数器变量的访问。


The database uses mutexes to ensure data consistency during concurrent updates. 数据库使用互斥锁来确保并发更新期间的数据一致性。 | semaphores, locks |  (No direct antonym, as the absence of a mutex doesn't define a specific opposite concept.  The opposite would be uncontrolled concurrent access.) | n.
