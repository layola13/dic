词源:

The word "procrastinating" comes from the Latin word "procrastinare," which is a combination of:

* "pro" - meaning "forward"
* "cras" - meaning "tomorrow"

Therefore, the literal translation of "procrastinare" is "to put off until tomorrow."  The "-ing" suffix indicates the present participle form of the verb, describing the action of procrastinating.
