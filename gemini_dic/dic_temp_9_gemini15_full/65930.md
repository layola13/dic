词源:
The word "exacerbatingly" is derived from the verb "exacerbate," which comes from the Late Latin word "exacerbare," meaning "to embitter, exasperate."  This in turn comes from the Latin prefix "ex-" (out, thoroughly) and "acerbus," meaning "bitter, harsh, sour."  The "-ingly" suffix transforms the adjective "exacerbating" into an adverb.
