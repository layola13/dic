词源:

The word "regale" ultimately derives from the Old French word "regaler," meaning "to refresh, to make merry."  This, in turn, is related to the Old French "regal," meaning "kingly, royal," and ultimately to the Latin "regalis," also meaning "royal, kingly." The connection lies in the idea that royal feasts and entertainments were lavish and designed to please.  Over time, the meaning shifted from the royal context to a more general sense of entertaining or delighting.
