The word "fedity" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., according to the requested format.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  If you could provide the intended word or more context, I can offer assistance.
