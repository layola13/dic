词源：

The word "effeminate" originates from the Latin word "effeminatus," which is the past participle of "effeminare."  "Effeminare" itself is a combination of the prefix "ex-" (out, from) and "femina" (woman).  Therefore, the literal meaning is "to make into a woman" or "to make womanlike."  Over time, the meaning shifted to describe men exhibiting traits associated with women.
