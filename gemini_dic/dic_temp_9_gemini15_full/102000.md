Isocrymals are lines connecting points of equal refractive index or other optical property in a crystal or other anisotropic material. This term is primarily used in geology and crystallography to describe the distribution of optical properties within a material.  | Example: The isocrymal map showed the distribution of refractive indices within the gemstone. 等晶线图显示了宝石内部折射率的分布。 | 近义词: isogyre (in specific optical contexts) | 反义词:  N/A (no direct antonym, but contrasting terms would describe unequal distribution) |  词性:形容词
