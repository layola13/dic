The word "preadequateness" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling. There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide a response in the requested format.  To receive a helpful response, please provide a valid English word.
