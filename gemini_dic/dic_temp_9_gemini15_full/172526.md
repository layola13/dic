pyritic:/paɪˈrɪtɪk/| adj.|黄铁矿的；含黄铁矿的|Containing or relating to pyrite (iron disulfide, FeS2), a mineral that is often brassy yellow in color and is a common source of sulfur.  Pyritic rocks can be problematic in mining and construction because pyrite is prone to oxidation, which can produce sulfuric acid and cause environmental damage.|The pyritic rocks caused significant acid mine drainage. 黄铁矿岩石造成了严重的酸性矿山排水。 The pyritic ore body was rich in sulfur.  含黄铁矿矿体富含硫。|sulphurous, sulfurous|non-pyritic|


USAGE->

一般现在时:

虚拟语气:
If the rock were purely pyritic, the acid drainage would be more severe. = 如果岩石完全是黄铁矿，酸性排水将更加严重。
I wish we had known about the pyritic deposits earlier. = 我希望我们早点知道这些黄铁矿矿床。


被动语态:
