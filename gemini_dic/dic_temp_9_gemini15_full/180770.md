词源:
The word "regulated" comes from the verb "regulate," which is derived from the Late Latin word "regulare," meaning "to make straight, to rule."  "Regulare" itself is composed of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") and "gula" (meaning "rule" or "straight line").  Therefore, the etymological root implies the idea of bringing something back to order or a straight line, which is reflected in the meaning of "regulated."
