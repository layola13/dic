词源:
The word "probation" comes from the Late Latin word "probationem," meaning "a testing,"  "a proving," or "a trial."  This in turn derives from the Latin verb "probare," meaning "to prove" or "to test."  The modern English meaning evolved from the idea of testing someone's suitability or worthiness, initially in a religious or moral context, before expanding to legal and employment contexts.
