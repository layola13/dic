用法说明:

Noninflammabilities is a relatively uncommon word, typically used in technical contexts where the absence of flammability is a key characteristic.  It's a noun and functions grammatically like other nouns.  It can be used with various adjectives (e.g., "high noninflammabilities," "low noninflammabilities") to describe the degree of resistance to burning.  The word is often interchangeable with "fire resistance" or "incombustibility" in many contexts, though the latter might imply a complete absence of flammability.
