词源:  The word "oddment" is derived from the Old English word "odde," meaning "point," "angle," or "something projecting." Over time, this evolved to refer to something left over or remaining.  The suffix "-ment" indicates a result or product.  Therefore, "oddment" originally meant something projecting or sticking out, which later transitioned to mean a leftover piece or fragment.
