词源:
The word "feedstuffs" is a compound noun formed by combining "feed" (meaning food for animals) and "stuffs" (a collective noun referring to various materials or substances).  The origin of "feed" can be traced back to Old English *fēdan, meaning "to give food to."  "Stuffs" is a plural form derived from the Old English *stuf, meaning "material," or "substance."
