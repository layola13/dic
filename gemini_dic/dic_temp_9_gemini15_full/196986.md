The word "{shakai}" is not an English word.  It appears to be a romanization of a word from another language, most likely Japanese (社会 - shakai).  Therefore, a standard English word analysis is not possible.  To provide the requested information, we need to analyze the Japanese word 社会 (shakai).


社会 (shakai): /ʃaˈkaɪ/ | n. | 社会 | Society; social; community |

英文解析:  The Japanese word *shakai* (社会) refers to society, a community of people living together in a more or less ordered community.  It can also refer to a specific social group or system.


例句:

日本の社会は複雑だ。  Nihon no shakai wa fukuzatsu da. = Japanese society is complex.

彼女は社会活動に積極的に参加している。 Kanojo wa shakai katsudō ni sekkyoku teki ni sanka shite iru. = She actively participates in social activities.


近义词:  コミュニティ (komyuniti - community), 集団 (shūdan - group), 社会組織 (shakai soshiki - social organization)


反义词:  There isn't a direct antonym, but words implying isolation or lack of social interaction could be considered opposites, such as:  孤独 (kodoku - loneliness), 隔離 (kakuri - isolation).


词性:  Noun (名词)


Since this is a Japanese word, providing English grammatical usages like "general present tense," etc., is irrelevant.  The grammatical usage would be within the context of Japanese sentence structure.
