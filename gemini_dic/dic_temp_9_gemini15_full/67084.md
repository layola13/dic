词源:
From Old French *exploiter, from Late Latin *ex-plōrāre, from Latin explōrāre "to explore, investigate," from ex- "out" + plōrāre "to cry out, weep," hence "to search thoroughly."  The modern sense developed from the idea of thoroughly investigating something to fully utilize it, shifting to the negative connotation of unfair use.
