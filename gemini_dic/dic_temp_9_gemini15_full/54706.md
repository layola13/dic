词源:
The word "disorientation" is derived from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the noun "orientation," which originally comes from the Latin word "oriens," meaning "rising" (as in the rising sun).  "Orientation" originally referred to the act of determining one's position in relation to the cardinal directions (east, west, north, south). Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass a general sense of place, time, and understanding. Therefore, "disorientation" signifies the opposite: a lack of understanding or awareness of one's surroundings, position, or time.
