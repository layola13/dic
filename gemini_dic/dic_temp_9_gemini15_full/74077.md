词源:

The word "fossilized" comes from the word "fossil," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "fossilis," meaning "dug up."  The suffix "-ized" indicates the process of becoming or being made into something.  Therefore, "fossilized" literally means "made into a fossil" or "having become a fossil."
