词源:
The word "cunctator" comes from the Latin verb "cunctari," meaning "to delay" or "to hesitate."  It was famously used to describe Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus, a Roman general known for his strategy of delaying tactics against Hannibal during the Second Punic War.  His approach, characterized by avoiding direct confrontation and instead wearing down the enemy through attrition, became synonymous with the term "cunctator."
