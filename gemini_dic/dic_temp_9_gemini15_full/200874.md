词源:
The word "slingshot" is a compound word combining "sling" (a device for throwing stones) and "shot" (the act of throwing or shooting).  The "sling" part has roots in Old English, while "shot" derives from Old Norse.  The combined word emerged in the late 19th century to describe this specific type of projectile weapon.
