micron:/ˈmaɪkrɒn/| n. |微米，百万分之一米|A micron is a unit of length equal to one millionth of a meter (10⁻⁶ meter). It's now more commonly referred to as a micrometer (µm).|The dust particle was only a few microns in size.|近义词:micrometer, μm|反义词:kilometer, meter


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The dust particle measures several microns. = 尘埃颗粒大小为几微米。
This microscope can magnify objects up to 1000 microns. = 这台显微镜可以放大物体至1000微米。


一般过去时:
Scientists measured the micron-sized particles. = 科学家测量了微米大小的粒子。
The engineers found the error to be only a few microns. = 工程师发现误差只有几微米。


现在完成时:
Researchers have discovered new applications for micron-sized sensors. = 研究人员已经发现了微米级传感器的新的应用。
Scientists have analyzed the data from the micron-level imaging. = 科学家们已经分析了微米级成像的数据。


过去完成时:
They had already analyzed the micron-scale structures before the presentation. = 他们在演示之前就已经分析了微米级的结构。
The team had calibrated the instrument to measure microns accurately. = 该团队已经校准了仪器以精确测量微米。


将来时:
We will use a micron-precision instrument for the experiment. = 我们将在实验中使用微米精度的仪器。
They will analyze the results at the micron level. = 他们将分析微米级的结果。


虚拟语气:
If the particle were only a few microns smaller, it would have passed through the filter. = 如果粒子再小几微米，它就能通过过滤器了。
I wish I had a microscope that could measure microns accurately. = 我真希望我有一台可以精确测量微米的显微镜。


被动语态:
The size of the particles was measured in microns. = 粒子的大小是用微米测量的。
The images were processed to highlight micron-sized features. = 图像经过处理以突出微米大小的特征。


疑问句:
What is the size of the particle in microns? = 粒子的尺寸是多少微米？
How many microns thick is this film? = 这层薄膜有多厚（以微米为单位）？


否定句:
The error was not more than a few microns. = 误差不会超过几微米。
The particles were not visible to the naked eye, being only a few microns in size. = 这些粒子肉眼不可见，因为它们只有几微米大小。


PHRASE->
micron-sized particles = 微米级颗粒
micron-level analysis = 微米级分析
micron-precision instrument = 微米精度仪器
micron-scale imaging = 微米级成像
micron filter = 微米过滤器
