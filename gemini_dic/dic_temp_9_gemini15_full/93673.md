* It's a misspelling:  Could you be thinking of another word?  If you can provide the context in which you encountered "imed," I might be able to suggest a correction.
* It's a newly coined word or slang:  In this case, without context, its meaning and usage are unknown.
* It's a word from a specific technical field or niche language:  Again, context is needed to determine its meaning.
