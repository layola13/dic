PHRASE->

There are limited common phrases directly using "osculate". The word is more often used in technical contexts (mathematics) or figuratively.  Therefore, providing common phrases is not applicable in the same way as with words like "what."  The focus is on its use in specific contexts.

词源:
From Latin *osculārī "to kiss," from osculum "a kiss," diminutive of os "mouth."  The mathematical meaning developed later from the visual similarity of a kiss (a point of close contact) to curves being tangent.
