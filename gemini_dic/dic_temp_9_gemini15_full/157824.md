词源:
The word "plagiarising" comes from the Latin word "plagiarius," meaning "kidnapper."  The original sense referred to the kidnapping of slaves or people, and later extended to the "kidnapping" of someone else's ideas or words.  The transition in meaning reflects the idea that intellectual property is essentially "stolen" when plagiarised.
