词源:
Glamorizing comes from the word "glamour," which itself has a complex etymology.  It ultimately derives from the Scottish word "grammaire," meaning "grammar" or "magical skill."  Over time, the meaning shifted from magical skill to enchantment and ultimately to the modern sense of attractiveness and allure.  The "-izing" suffix indicates the process of making something glamorous.
