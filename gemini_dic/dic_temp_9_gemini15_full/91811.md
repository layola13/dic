/ˌhaɪpərˌfleksɪˈbɪlənɪsəz/ | n. | 超级柔韧性；极度灵活性的多种状态 | The word "hyperflexiblenesses" is a relatively uncommon word, formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to the adjective "hyperflexible," which itself combines "hyper-" (meaning excessive or beyond normal) and "flexible" (capable of bending easily without breaking).  It refers to the multiple instances or aspects of possessing extreme flexibility.  The word highlights the plurality of ways in which this extreme flexibility might manifest. Because of its complexity and infrequent use, it's important to consider whether a simpler term, such as "extreme flexibilities" or "multiple instances of hyperflexibility," would be more appropriate in most contexts.  |  The gymnast's hyperflexiblenesses allowed her to perform incredible contortions.  体操运动员的超级柔韧性使她能够做出令人难以置信的扭曲动作。  The study examined the various hyperflexiblenesses observed in different populations. 这项研究考察了在不同人群中观察到的各种超级柔韧性。 | extreme flexibilities, multiple instances of hyperflexibility | inflexibilities, rigidities |  名词
