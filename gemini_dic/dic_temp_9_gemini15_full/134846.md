/nɑːnˈmɑːdərətli/| adj. |非适度地，不适度地 |The word "nonmoderately" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with "moderately" (meaning "to a moderate degree").  Therefore, it means "not moderately," implying something is neither moderate nor extreme, but somewhere in between, or possibly excessively so, depending on context. However, due to its lack of standard usage, its meaning can be ambiguous and should be avoided in formal writing.  Instead, use clearer, more precise language to convey the intended meaning.|例句：While not explicitly stated, the use of "nonmoderately" in a sentence would imply a level of intensity or frequency that's neither mild nor excessive. For example, one might (incorrectly) write: "He exercised nonmoderately," suggesting an exercise routine that is neither light nor extreme, a somewhat awkward and unclear expression. A better choice would be to specify the nature of the exercise. |近义词: moderately, somewhat, to some extent, fairly|反义词: extremely, excessively, moderately
