词源:
The word "eye-watering" is a relatively modern idiom. It's a descriptive phrase that emerged from the literal sensation of having your eyes water from strong smells or irritants, and this literal sense is then extended metaphorically to describe something so shocking or intense it has a similar effect.  There's no single identifiable origin point, but its use likely grew organically from the common experience of strong smells or spicy foods causing eyes to water.
