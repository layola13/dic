The word "cromy" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* **It's a proper noun:**  Is it a name, place, or brand?  If so, more context is needed.
* **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, jargon, or slang within a specific community or context.  Providing that context would be helpful.
* **It's a word from another language:**  If it's from another language, please specify the language.

Please provide more information so I can assist you accurately.
