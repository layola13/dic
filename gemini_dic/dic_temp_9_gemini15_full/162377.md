preacquittals: /ˌpriːəˈkwɪtəlz/ | n. | 预先无罪释放；提前释放 |  This word is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word or phrase, formed by combining "pre-" (before) and "acquittals" (the act of declaring someone not guilty).  It suggests a situation where someone is declared not guilty *before* a trial or formal accusation even takes place. This could occur in various hypothetical legal or administrative contexts.  Because it's not a standard word, examples and grammatical usage are speculative.

The suspected criminal received preacquittals due to lack of sufficient evidence, and consequently, the case was dismissed. = 由于证据不足，嫌疑犯获得了预先无罪释放，因此案件被驳回。


The committee granted preacquittals to all employees involved in the incident after a thorough investigation. = 在彻底调查之后，委员会给予所有参与此事件的员工预先无罪释放。
