词源:

The word "invasive" comes from the Latin word "invadere," meaning "to go into," "to enter," or "to attack."  The prefix "in-" means "in" or "into," and the root "-vadere" means "to go" or "to walk."  Over time, "invadere" evolved into the English verb "invade," and subsequently, the adjective "invasive" emerged to describe things that invade or intrude.
