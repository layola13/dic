The word "envolup" does not exist in standard English.  It's likely a misspelling or a word from a very specialized or non-standard lexicon.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  To get a response, please provide a correctly spelled word.
