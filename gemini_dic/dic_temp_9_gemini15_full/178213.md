词源:
The word "recommenders" is derived from the verb "recommend," which comes from the Old French word "recommander," ultimately from the Latin "recommendo," a compound of "re-" (again) and "commendo" (I entrust, I commit).  Thus, "recommenders" literally refers to those who entrust or commit someone to the care or consideration of another.
