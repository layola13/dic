incoherentific: /ˌɪnkoʊhɪrənˈtɪfɪk/ | adj. | 不连贯的；缺乏逻辑的 |  Not coherent; lacking logical connection; nonsensical.  The word is a blend of "incoherent" and "-ific," a suffix suggesting the making or causing of something.  It implies a process or tendency to make something incoherent.  This is a relatively rare and informal word.  There is no established standard usage or grammatical tense conjugation as it's not a widely used word.
