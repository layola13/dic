PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "overbumptiously" as it's a relatively rare and newly coined word.  The word itself functions as an intensifier to describe behaviour.  Phrases would need to be created  around it,  for example:

overbumptiously confident = 过分自信
overbumptiously assertive = 过分自信且强势
overbumptiously self-assured = 过分自负
overbumptiously behaved = 行为极其傲慢
overbumptiously declared = 自以为是地宣布

词源:

The word "overbumptiously" is a relatively recent creation, formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively) to "bumptiously," which itself derives from "bumptious."  "Bumptious" means self-assertive or arrogant in a loud and obnoxious way.  The ultimate origin likely lies in a now-obscure onomatopoeic root that suggested a forceful or loud manner.
