WORD ORIGIN->
The word "integrity" comes from the Latin word "integritas," which means "wholeness," "untouched," or "unimpaired."  It's derived from the Latin verb "integer," meaning "whole," "untouched," or "complete."  The evolution of the word reflects the dual meaning of the term: both physical wholeness and moral completeness.
