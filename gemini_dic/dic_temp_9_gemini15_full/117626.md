The word "megass" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a slang term, or a word from a specific dialect or jargon.  To provide an analysis, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered this term.
