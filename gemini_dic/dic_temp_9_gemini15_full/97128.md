The word "infilm" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is not possible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a very niche context.

To provide a helpful response, I need clarification:

* **Is this a misspelling?**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding or spelled word?
* **Is it a neologism?** If so, what is its intended meaning and usage?  Providing context would be extremely beneficial.
* **Is it jargon or slang from a specific field?** If so, please specify the field.


Once you provide more information, I can attempt to offer a more accurate analysis.
