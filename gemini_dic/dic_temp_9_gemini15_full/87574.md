heteroplasm:/ˈhɛtərəʊˌplæzəm/|/ˈhɛtəroʊˌplæzəm/| n. |异质体，异质性细胞质|A heteroplasm refers to the presence of more than one type of organelle genome (e.g., mitochondrial DNA) within a single cell or organism.  This is in contrast to homoplasmy, where only one type of organelle genome is present.  The presence of different mitochondrial DNA molecules within a single cell can lead to variable expression of mitochondrial genes and is a factor in the development of several diseases. |Example: The study revealed significant heteroplasmy in the mitochondrial DNA of the patients. 这项研究揭示了患者线粒体DNA中存在显著的异质性。|近义词：mixed population,  varied organelles|反义词：homoplasmy
