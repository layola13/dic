The word "kranging" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely:

1. **A misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of another word, perhaps one related to sounds or actions.  Without more context, it's impossible to say what the intended word might be.

2. **A neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, a slang term, or a word specific to a particular dialect or community.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **Onomatopoeia:**  It might be an attempt to represent a sound, similar to words like "clanging" or "jangling."
