/ˌsɛmiˈrædɪkəlˌnɛsɪz/| n. |半激进性；半激进主义的各种表现|The word "semiradicalnesses" is a rare and somewhat contrived word, formed by combining "semi" (half, partly), "radical" (fundamental, extreme), and the plural suffix "-nesses." It refers to the various manifestations or aspects of something that is only partly or moderately radical.  The word highlights the multifaceted nature of such a concept.  Due to its rarity, finding common usage examples is difficult. It's more likely to be encountered in academic or highly specialized contexts. |例句：The professor's analysis explored the multifaceted semiradicalnesses of the social movement. (教授的分析探讨了社会运动的多方面半激进性。)  The different semiradicalnesses of the political party's platform were debated extensively.
