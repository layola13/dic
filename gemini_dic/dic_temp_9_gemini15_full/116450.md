词源:

Matchmaking comes from the combination of "match" and "making."  "Match" in this context refers to finding suitable partners, likely originating from the idea of finding two things that fit together well, like a pair of socks. "Making" is the act of creating or bringing something into existence.  The term thus signifies the act of creating a match or pairing, particularly in the context of marriage or relationships.
