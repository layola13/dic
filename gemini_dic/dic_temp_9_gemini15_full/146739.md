overhuge: /ˌoʊvərˈhjuːdʒ/ | adj. | 巨大的，庞大的 | Extremely large; excessively huge.  This word is informal and emphasizes the excessive size. |例句：The overhuge cake was almost impossible to carry.  这块巨大的蛋糕几乎无法搬动。

近义词：enormous, immense, gigantic, colossal, massive | 反义词：tiny, minuscule, diminutive


词源:  The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great extent) and "huge" (meaning very large). It's a relatively modern formation, not found in older dictionaries.  The use of "over-" as an intensifier is common in informal English.


用法说明：

overhuge is primarily used as an informal adjective to describe something that is exceptionally large, often to an excessive or overwhelming degree. It carries a connotation of being more than just large; it suggests a size that is disproportionate or surprising.  It's not suitable for formal writing.

由于overhuge是一个非正式的词语，以下的语法范例将使用更正式的同义词"enormous" 或 "gigantic"进行说明。
