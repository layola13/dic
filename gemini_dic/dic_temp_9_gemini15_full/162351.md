preacidity: /ˌpriːæˈsɪdəti/ | n. | 预先酸化；先期酸化 |  The condition of being acidic before the normal onset of acidity.

Or, certain foods might induce preacidity in the stomach, leading to later heartburn. |  The soil showed signs of preacidity before the acid rain event. = 这土壤在酸雨事件发生前就显示出先期酸化的迹象。 The patient experienced preacidity symptoms, indicating potential digestive issues. = 病人出现先期酸化症状，表明可能有消化问题。 |  先期酸性，前期酸度 |  后酸化，碱性 | 名词
