词源:
The word "enjoinment" comes from the verb "enjoin," which originates from Old French "enjoindre," ultimately derived from the Latin "injungere," meaning "to order, command."  The prefix "in-" means "in" or "on," and "jungere" means "to join."  Thus, the original meaning involved "joining in" or "imposing" a command.
