phenocryst: /ˈfɛnoʊkrɪst/ | n. |斑晶| A relatively large crystal embedded in a finer-grained igneous rock.  Phenocrysts are formed by slow cooling of magma before eruption, allowing larger crystals to grow. They contrast with the groundmass, which is the finer-grained material surrounding the phenocrysts.  The presence of phenocrysts suggests a two-stage cooling process. | Example: The porphyritic basalt showed numerous feldspar phenocrysts scattered throughout the finer-grained matrix.  该斑状玄武岩显示出许多散布在细粒基质中的长石斑晶。|近义词: porphyroblast (in metamorphic rocks)|反义词: microlit (extremely small crystal)
