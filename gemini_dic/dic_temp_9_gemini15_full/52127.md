反义词：irrational, illogical, emotional, unthinking


词源:  From Greek *dianoia* ("thought, mind, understanding"), from *dia-* ("through, across, between") + *nous* ("mind, intellect").  The suffix "-etic" denotes "relating to" or "characterized by."  Thus, "dianoetic" literally means "relating to thinking through."


USAGE->  (This word is primarily an adjective and doesn't have verb conjugations like "what".)  It describes the *nature* of thinking, not actions.  Therefore, tense and voice are not applicable in the same way as with verbs.


PHRASE->

(Phrases using "dianoetic" are less common and generally involve combining it with nouns.)

dianoetic process: 思维过程
dianoetic activity: 思维活动
dianoetic skills: 思维能力
dianoetic development: 思维发展
