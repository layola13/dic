词源:

The word is formed from:

* **non-**: a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of"
* **departmental**: relating to a department or ministry.  This itself comes from "department" (a division of a large organization) + "-al" (forming adjectives).

Therefore, "nondepartmentally" literally means "not in a departmental manner."
