microfelsitic: /ˌmaɪkroʊfɛlˈsɪtɪk/ | adj. | 微晶的 |  Characterized by a very fine-grained texture composed of microscopic crystals, typically of feldspar or quartz.  The term is commonly used in geology to describe igneous rocks.  | 例句：The thin section revealed a microfelsitic texture in the volcanic rock. = 薄片显示火山岩具有微晶结构。


The microfelsitic rhyolite showed evidence of rapid cooling. = 微晶流纹岩显示快速冷却的证据。 | 近义词：aphanitic, cryptocrystalline | 反义词：phaneritic, macrocrystalline |


USAGE->

Geologists had already classified the rock as microfelsitic before the new findings. = 在新的发现之前，地质学家们已经将这种岩石归类为微晶岩。
The team had suspected a microfelsitic composition before the analysis was complete. = 在分析完成之前，研究小组就怀疑是微晶成分。

将来时:
The analysis will reveal whether the rock is microfelsitic or not. = 分析将揭示岩石是否是微晶的。
We will use a microscope to identify the microfelsitic texture. = 我们将使用显微镜来识别微晶结构。

虚拟语气:
If the rock were microfelsitic, it would exhibit certain optical properties. = 如果岩石是微晶的，它将表现出某些光学特性。
I wish I had a better microscope to study the microfelsitic details. = 我希望我有一个更好的显微镜来研究微晶细节。

被动语态:

The texture is described as microfelsitic in the geological report. = 在地质报告中，该结构被描述为微晶的。

疑问句:
Is the rock sample microfelsitic? = 岩石样本是微晶的吗？
Are all volcanic rocks microfelsitic? = 所有火山岩都是微晶的吗？

否定句:
The rock is not microfelsitic; it is porphyritic. = 这块岩石不是微晶的；它是斑状的。
The texture is not entirely microfelsitic; it shows some larger crystals. = 结构并非完全是微晶的；它显示一些较大的晶体。


PHRASE->
microfelsitic texture: 微晶结构
microfelsitic rhyolite: 微晶流纹岩
microfelsitic basalt: 微晶玄武岩
microfelsitic andesite: 微晶安山岩
microfelsitic groundmass: 微晶基质


词源:
The word "microfelsitic" is a combination of:

* **micro-**:  From Greek *mikros* meaning "small".
* **felsitic**: Relating to felsic rocks, which are igneous rocks rich in feldspar and silica.  This in turn derives from "feldspar".

Therefore, "microfelsitic" describes a rock texture characterized by very small crystals of feldspar and silica minerals.
