polyethylenes: /ˌpɒliˈeθɪliːnz/ /ˌpɑːliˈɛθɪliːnz/ | n. | 聚乙烯类 | Polyethylenes are a group of thermoplastic polymers that are widely used in various applications due to their flexibility, durability, and low cost.  They are produced through the polymerization of ethylene monomers.  Different types of polyethylenes exist, each with varying properties depending on the polymerization process and density.  |  例句：Many plastic bags are made from low-density polyethylenes. 许多塑料袋是用低密度聚乙烯制成的。

例句：High-density polyethylenes are used in the production of bottles and containers. 高密度聚乙烯用于生产瓶子和容器。


近义词: polyolefins (更广义的术语) | 反义词:  无直接反义词，可考虑与其他类型的塑料对比，例如：polypropylene, polystyrene | 词性:名词
