/siːpiːdʒiː/|/ˈsiːpiːdʒiː/| n. |CpG位点|CpG site, a cytosine base followed by a guanine base, linked by a phosphate bond in a DNA sequence.  These sites are often methylated in mammals, playing a role in gene regulation. |Example: The methylation of CpG sites is crucial for gene silencing in certain developmental processes. CpG位点的甲基化对于某些发育过程中的基因沉默至关重要。|近义词：DNA sequence motif, methylation site|反义词：无
