phyllite:/ˈfaɪlaɪt/| n. |千枚岩|A phyllite is a type of metamorphic rock formed from the metamorphism of mudstone or shale.  It's characterized by a fine-grained texture and a silky or satiny sheen due to the parallel alignment of microscopic minerals. Phyllites are intermediate in metamorphic grade between slate and schist.  They are often found in regions of regional metamorphism, where intense heat and pressure have altered the original sedimentary rock.|The geologist identified the sample as phyllite due to its characteristic sheen and fine-grained texture.|近义词：slate (less metamorphosed), schist (more metamorphosed)|反义词：N/A


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The phyllite shows a distinct cleavage. = 千枚岩显示出明显的解理。
Phyllite forms from the metamorphism of mudstone. = 千枚岩由泥岩变质形成。


一般过去时:
The geologists studied the phyllite samples. = 地质学家研究了千枚岩样本。
We identified the rock as phyllite based on its properties. = 我们根据其特性将岩石鉴定为千枚岩。


现在完成时:
Geologists have discovered many phyllite deposits. = 地质学家已经发现了许多千枚岩矿床。
Scientists have analyzed the mineral composition of the phyllite. = 科学家已经分析了千枚岩的矿物成分。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, they had assumed it was slate. = 在分析之前，他们曾认为它是板岩。
The researchers had already studied similar phyllite formations. = 研究人员已经研究过类似的千枚岩地层。


将来时:
We will examine the phyllite under a microscope. = 我们将在显微镜下检查千枚岩。
The team will present their findings on the phyllite. = 该团队将展示他们关于千枚岩的研究结果。


虚拟语气:
If this were schist, it would be coarser-grained. = 如果这是片岩，它会更粗粒。
I wish I had more time to study the phyllite. = 我希望我有更多时间来研究千枚岩。


被动语态:
The phyllite was formed by regional metamorphism. = 千枚岩是由区域变质作用形成的。
The sample is being analyzed for its mineral content. = 样本正在被分析其矿物含量。


疑问句:
Is this rock a phyllite or a slate? = 这块岩石是千枚岩还是板岩？
What is the age of the phyllite formation? = 千枚岩地层的年龄是多少？


否定句:
This sample is not phyllite; it's schist. = 这个样本不是千枚岩；它是片岩。
The rock did not exhibit the characteristic phyllitic sheen. = 这块岩石没有显示出千枚岩的特征光泽。
