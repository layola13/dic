fathomer:/ˈfæðəmə(r)/| n. |測深儀；測深者 | A fathom is a unit of length equal to six feet (approximately 1.8 meters), traditionally used to measure water depth.  A fathomer, therefore, can refer to a device used for measuring depth, typically in water, or a person who measures depth. The word's meaning is largely nautical and historically tied to the practice of sounding (measuring depth) in ships. | Example: The ship's crew used a modern fathomer to chart the ocean floor.  船员使用现代测深仪绘制海底地形图。  |近义词：depth gauge, depth sounder, plumb line |反义词：None directly applicable.
