self-colour: /ˈsɛlf ˈkʌlə(r)/ | adj. | 同色系的；单色的 |  Of the same colour throughout; monochrome.  The term usually refers to fabrics or materials where the yarn or fibers are dyed before weaving or knitting, resulting in a consistent colour throughout the material. | 例句：The dress is self-colour, a deep shade of navy blue. 这件裙子是单色的，深海军蓝色。

The sofa is made of self-colour fabric; there's no pattern.  沙发是用同色系的布料做的；没有图案。

近义词：monochrome, solid-colored, single-coloured | 反义词：multicoloured, multicolored, patterned


词源:  The word is a compound of "self" and "colour" (or "color"). "Self" here indicates that the color is inherent and uniform throughout the material, not applied as a pattern or print. "Colour" refers to the hue or shade of the material.  The etymology of "colour" traces back to Old French "color" and ultimately to Latin "color," meaning "appearance, complexion, hue."
