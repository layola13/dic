lactodensimeter:/ˌlæktəʊdɛnˈsɪmɪtər/| n. |乳密度计|A lactodensimeter is an instrument used to measure the density of milk. It is typically used in the dairy industry to determine the quality and purity of milk, as the density of milk can be affected by factors such as water content and fat content.  The lactodensimeter works on the principle of buoyancy, with a scale calibrated to read the specific gravity of the milk sample.|The dairy farmer used a lactodensimeter to check the density of his freshly milked cows' milk.|近义词：milk tester, densitometer|反义词：无
