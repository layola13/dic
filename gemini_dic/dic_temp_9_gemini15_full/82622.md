The word "guay" does not exist in standard English.  It's likely a misspelling, a word from a dialect, or a proper noun.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, please clarify:

1. **Is this a misspelling?** If so, what word did you intend to use?
2. **Is this a word from a specific dialect or language?** If so, please specify the dialect or language.
3. **Is this a proper noun (like a person's name or place name)?** If so, please provide more context.


Once you provide this information, I can offer a more accurate and complete analysis.
