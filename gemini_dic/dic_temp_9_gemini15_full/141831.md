orbulina:/ɔːrˈbjuːlɪnə/ | n. | 球形虫 | A genus of planktonic foraminifera characterized by its spherical test (shell) and complex internal structure.  Orbulinas are important microfossils used in biostratigraphy and paleoceanography. | Example: The presence of *Orbulina universa* in the sediment core indicates a warm, open-ocean environment.  球形虫属在沉积物岩心中存在表明温暖的开阔海洋环境。|近义词:Globigerina (a related genus)|反义词:None
