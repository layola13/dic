preinfects:/ˌpriːɪnˈfɛkts/| v. | 预先感染；先期感染 | To infect beforehand or before other infections occur.  This term is primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly in virology and epidemiology, to describe the infection of a host before another infection takes place, often influencing the course or outcome of the subsequent infection.  | Example:  "The preinfection with a mild strain of the virus seemed to offer some protection against the more virulent strain." = “先感染温和的病毒株似乎对更强的毒株提供了一些保护。” | 近义词：prior infection, antecedent infection | 反义词：postinfection
