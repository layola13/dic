/ˌoʊvərˌsɪstəˈmætɪknəsɪz/ | n. |过度系统性；过分系统化； |The word "oversystematicnesses" is a rare and highly unusual word. It describes the state of being excessively systematic or the multiple instances of such a state.  It's formed by adding "-nesses" (a pluralizing suffix indicating multiple states or qualities) to "oversystematic" (itself a combination of "over-" meaning excessively and "systematic"). The word is generally considered to be unnecessarily long and cumbersome, and there are simpler ways to express the same idea.  There is no established usage in standard dictionaries or corpora.  It's more likely to be found in humorous or highly specialized contexts. |例句：The professor's oversystematicnesses in his research methodology ultimately hindered his progress. (教授研究方法的过度系统性最终阻碍了他的进步。)  The numerous oversystematicnesses in their project management led to delays and inefficiencies. (他们项目管理中多次过度系统化导致了延误和低效率。) |近义词：excessive systematization, over-organization, hyper-systematic approaches, meticulousness (to an extreme), pedantry |反义词：disorganization, haphazardness, randomness, casualness
