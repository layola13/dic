granitification: /ˌɡrænɪtɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/ | n. | 花岗岩化；变成花岗岩 | The process by which rocks are transformed into granite. This involves various geological processes, such as the intrusion of magma and subsequent metamorphism. | Example: The granitification of the sedimentary rocks resulted in the formation of a large granite batholith. 花岗岩化沉积岩导致形成一个大型花岗岩基岩体。 | 近义词：metamorphism, magmatism | 反义词：None specifically, but processes that oppose the formation of granite, such as erosion, could be considered antonyms in a broad sense.
