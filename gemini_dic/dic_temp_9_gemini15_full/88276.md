词源:
The word "hint" ultimately derives from the Old Norse word *hinnti, meaning "to stretch," "to reach," or "to touch."  This suggests a connection to the idea of subtly touching upon a subject without directly addressing it.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the indirect suggestion or implication of something.
