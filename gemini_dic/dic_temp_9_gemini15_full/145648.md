词源:

The word "overcontentment" is a compound word.  It combines the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessive") with the noun "contentment" (meaning satisfaction or happiness).  "Contentment" itself comes from the Old French word "contentement," ultimately derived from the Latin "contentus," the past participle of "contēnēre" (to contain, hold together, restrain).  The sense of "being satisfied" developed from the idea of having one's desires contained or fulfilled.
