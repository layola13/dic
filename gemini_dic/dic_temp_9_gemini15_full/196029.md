词源:

The word "sentry-box" is a compound word.  "Sentry" comes from the Old French word "sentrie," meaning "sentinel," which ultimately derives from the Latin "sentire," meaning "to feel" or "to perceive."  "Box" refers to a small enclosed space or structure.  Therefore, a sentry-box is literally a "box" for a "sentry."
