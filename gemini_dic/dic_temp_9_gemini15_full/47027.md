dasypaedes:/ˌdæzɪˈpiːdiːz/| n. |多毛动物|This word, "dasypaedes,"  refers to a type of animal characterized by its hairy or furry nature.  It's not a commonly used word in modern English and lacks widespread recognition. Its usage is primarily confined to specialized contexts within zoology or related fields dealing with animal classification or descriptions. There are no readily available examples of its usage in sentences due to its limited application.  Because of its rarity, identifying synonyms or antonyms proves challenging.  The word itself doesn't lend itself to grammatical analysis beyond its nominal function.


词源:The word is derived from Greek roots: "dasys" (δασύς), meaning "hairy" or "shaggy," and "paides" (παιδές), meaning "children" or "boys." The combination suggests an animal with hairy young.  However, the precise species or group it originally denoted remains unclear without further context from its historical usage.


用法说明:Due to the word's obscurity, providing examples of usage across various tenses and grammatical structures is impractical.  Its usage would be highly specialized, likely within scientific publications or older texts on natural history.  The word is not a common part of everyday English vocabulary.
