词源:
The word "intemperance" comes from the Old French word "intemperance," which in turn is derived from the Latin word "intemperantia."  "In-" is a negative prefix, "temper-" relates to "temper" meaning moderation or balance, and "-ance" is a noun suffix indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, intemperance literally means "lack of moderation" or "excess."
