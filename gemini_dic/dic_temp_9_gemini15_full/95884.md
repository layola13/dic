词源:
The word "increasing" comes from the verb "increase," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "encreistre," meaning "to grow," "to increase," or "to become larger."  "Encreistre" itself is composed of the prefix "en-" (meaning "in" or "into") and the verb "creistre" (meaning "to grow").  This ultimately traces back to the Latin verb "crescere," also meaning "to grow."
