词源:
The word "painfully" is derived from the adjective "painful," which is formed from the noun "pain" plus the suffix "-ful."  "Pain" ultimately comes from the Old French "peine" and the Latin "poena," both meaning "penalty," "punishment," or "suffering."  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective "painful" into an adverb, modifying verbs and adjectives to indicate the manner in which an action is performed or a quality exists.
