词源:
The word "canakin" is derived from the Middle English word "canake," which ultimately originates from the Old French word "canaque," meaning "a small cup or vessel."  The "-in" suffix is a diminutive, suggesting smallness.  The evolution reflects the change in usage from a small drinking vessel to a small brazier, likely due to the shape and size similarity.
