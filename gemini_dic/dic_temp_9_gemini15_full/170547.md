/ˈsuːdəɡeɪt/ | n. |假工蟻，擬工蟻 | A pseudergate is a sterile female ant in a colony that is intermediate in development between a larva and a worker.  They are morphologically similar to workers but lack the full reproductive capacity.  Pseudergates often perform tasks associated with brood care or food gathering, contributing to the colony's overall function.  The term is primarily used in myrmecology (the study of ants). | Example:  The colony's pseudergates were diligently tending to the brood of larvae.  =  蚁群中的假工蚁正勤奋地照料着幼虫。 | 近义词:  (no perfect synonyms, but could be loosely related to) worker ant, larva | 反义词: queen, reproductive female
