periplast:/ˈpɛrɪplæst/| n.|周质，外膜|A periplast is a proteinaceous layer outside the cell membrane of some organisms, particularly certain bacteria and archaea. It provides structural support and protection.  It's often associated with the cell wall but is distinct from it.|Example:  The periplast of this bacterium contributes to its resistance to harsh environments.  这个细菌的周质有助于其抵抗恶劣环境。|近义词： outer membrane (in some contexts), cell envelope|反义词：cytoplasm

The bacteria possess a strong periplast. = 细菌拥有坚固的周质。

一般过去时:
Scientists studied the periplast's structure. = 科学家研究了周质的结构。
The periplast was damaged by the antibiotic. = 周质被抗生素破坏了。

现在完成时:
Researchers have identified a new type of periplast. = 研究人员已经发现了一种新型周质。
Scientists have analyzed the periplast's composition. = 科学家已经分析了周质的成分。

过去完成时:
They had already observed the periplast before the experiment. = 他们在实验前就已经观察到周质了。
