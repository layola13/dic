morintannic: /ˌmɒrɪnˈtænɪk/ | adj. |单宁酸的；鞣酸的| Relating to or derived from morin, a yellow flavonoid dye found in various plants, particularly in the wood of the Morus tinctoria (old fustic) tree.  It often refers to the tannins found in this wood, used historically for tanning leather and dyeing fabrics.|  The morintannic acid in the old fustic extract was used to dye the fabric a rich golden-brown.  |近义词: tannic, gallic | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, but could be described as the opposite of "untanned" in the context of leather)|
