词源:
The word "nondexterous" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "dexterous," which comes from the Latin word "dexter," meaning "right hand" (and by extension, skillful).  The association with the right hand stems from the fact that in many cultures, right-handedness is associated with skill and ability.  Therefore, "nondexterous" literally means "not right-handed" in the sense of not being skillful or nimble.
