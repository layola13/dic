词源:
The word "defy" comes from the Old French word "defier," meaning "to challenge," "to distrust," or "to refuse." This, in turn, is derived from the Latin word "diffidare," which means "to distrust," formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart") and "fidare" (meaning "to trust").  The sense of resisting or opposing authority evolved from the earlier meaning of challenging or distrusting that authority.
