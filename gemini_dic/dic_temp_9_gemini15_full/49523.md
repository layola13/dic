词源：

The word derives from the adjective "demanding," which itself originates from the verb "demand." "Demand" comes from the Old French "demander," meaning "to ask for," ultimately stemming from the Latin "demandare," meaning "to entrust," "to hand over," or "to commit." The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix forming nouns of quality or state. Thus, "demandingnesses" signifies the multiple instances or aspects of the state of being demanding.
