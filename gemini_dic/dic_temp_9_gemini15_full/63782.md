词源:  From Latin *epicurus, from Ancient Greek ἐπίκουρος (epíkouros) "helper, aid".  The word's association with fine dining derives from Epicurus, the Greek philosopher who advocated a life of simple pleasures, including good food and drink, but not excessive indulgence.  The modern meaning has shifted somewhat to emphasize refined taste and the appreciation of culinary excellence.
