parapophysis:/ˌpærəˈpɒfɪsɪs/| n. |侧突 (解剖学)|A parapophysis is a small, often rudimentary, projection on a vertebra, typically located near the base of the neural arch.  It is a point of attachment for muscles and ligaments. In some animals, it is more developed and plays a significant role in supporting the body. In humans, it is less prominent.|Example: The parapophysis of the thoracic vertebrae provide attachment points for the rib muscles.  侧突是胸椎的连接点，用于肋骨肌肉。|近义词: articular process (in some contexts) |反义词: None directly applicable.
