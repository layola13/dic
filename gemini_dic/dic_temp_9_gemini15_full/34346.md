词源:
The term "class consciousness" is a relatively recent coinage, emerging in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the rise of Marxist thought.  It combines the noun "class" (referring to a social group sharing similar economic circumstances) with "consciousness" (awareness or understanding).  The concept itself, however, has roots in earlier social theories that examined the impact of social stratification on individual and collective behavior.
