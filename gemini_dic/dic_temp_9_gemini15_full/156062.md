photophthalmic: /ˌfoʊtoʊˈθælmɪk/ | adj. | 感光性的；光致变色的 | Relating to or caused by the effect of light on the eye.  This term often refers to materials that change color in response to light exposure, particularly lenses that darken in bright sunlight and lighten in shade. | Example:  The photophthalmic lenses in his sunglasses adjusted automatically to the changing light conditions.  他的太阳镜上的感光镜片会根据光线变化自动调节。 | 近义词: photosensitive, light-sensitive | 反义词: photosensitive (in the context of a lack of response to light)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The photophthalmic lenses darken in bright sunlight. = 感光镜片在强烈的阳光下会变暗。
These materials show photophthalmic properties. = 这些材料表现出感光特性。


一般过去时:

否定句:
The lenses are not photophthalmic; they are simply tinted. = 这些镜片不是感光的；它们只是有色镜片。
This process does not involve any photophthalmic reactions. = 此过程不涉及任何感光反应。


PHRASE->
photophthalmic effect = 感光效应
photophthalmic reaction = 感光反应
photophthalmic properties = 感光特性
