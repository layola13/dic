词源:
The word "naturopathic" is derived from "nature" and "pathic".  "Nature" refers to the natural world and its processes. "Pathic" comes from the Greek word "pathos," meaning "suffering" or "disease,"  often used in medical terms to denote a particular type of treatment or approach to disease.  Therefore, "naturopathic" literally means relating to or involving treatment of disease using natural methods.
