词源:

The word "poleless" is a straightforward combination of the prefix "pole-" (meaning "pole" or "having poles") and the suffix "-less" (meaning "without" or "lacking").  It's a relatively modern term, reflecting the development of technologies that deviate from traditional designs incorporating poles (e.g., in motors and generators).
