The word "fujis" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (like a brand name), or a word from another language.  Therefore, a full etymological and grammatical analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide the requested information, I need a correctly spelled word or more context.
