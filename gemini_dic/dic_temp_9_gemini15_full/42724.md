词源:
The word "counterweight" is a compound word.  "Counter" means "against" or "opposite," and "weight" refers to a measure of heaviness.  Therefore, a counterweight literally means a weight that acts against or balances another weight.  Its origin traces back to the individual words "counter" and "weight," both with Old English roots.
