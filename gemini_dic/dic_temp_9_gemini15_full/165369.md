词源:
The word "prejudice" comes from the Old French word "prejugé," which is a past participle of the verb "prejuger."  "Prejuger" itself is composed of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and "juger" (meaning "to judge"). Therefore, the literal meaning is "to pre-judge," indicating a judgment formed before having sufficient knowledge or evidence.
