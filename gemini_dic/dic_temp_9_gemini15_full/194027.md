self-focusing: /ˈsɛlf ˈfoʊkəsɪŋ/ | adj. | 自聚焦的 |  Describes a phenomenon where a beam of light or other wave concentrates its energy into a smaller area as it propagates through a medium. This is typically due to a change in the refractive index of the medium caused by the beam itself.  | Example:  Self-focusing effects can be observed in nonlinear optical materials. 自聚焦效应可以在非线性光学材料中观察到。 The laser demonstrated significant self-focusing. 激光器表现出明显的自聚焦现象。| 近义词: beam concentration, optical concentration | 反义词: beam divergence, diffraction |
