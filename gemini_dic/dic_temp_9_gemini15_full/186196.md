词源:
rheumatoid derives from "rheumatism" + "-oid," meaning "resembling."  Rheumatism itself originates from the Greek word "rheuma," meaning "flow," referring to the fluid-like nature of the condition.  The suffix "-oid" indicates a resemblance, suggesting that rheumatoid arthritis shares characteristics with rheumatism, but is a distinct disease.
