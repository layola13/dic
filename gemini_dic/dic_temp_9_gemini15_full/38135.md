This word is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It is likely a non-standard formation, possibly an attempt to make the noun "comprehensiveness" possessive.   Correct usage would involve  "comprehensiveness of" or a similar construction rather than adding an apostrophe-s.

Therefore, the grammatical tenses, voices, etc.,  as requested in the example format, are not applicable to this non-standard word.  A proper analysis would focus on the word "comprehensiveness" itself.

**Etymology:**

The word "comprehensiveness" derives from the adjective "comprehensive," which itself comes from the verb "comprehend."

* **Comprehend:**  From Latin *comprehendere*, meaning "to grasp, seize, understand."  It's a combination of *com-* (together) and *prehendere* (to grasp, seize).

* **Comprehensive:**  Adding the suffix "-ive" creates the adjective meaning "including much or everything; wide-ranging."

* **Comprehensiveness:**  Adding the suffix "-ness" forms the noun, signifying the quality or state of being comprehensive.


**Usage Examples (using "comprehensiveness" correctly):**

* **General Usage:** The comprehensiveness of the museum's collection is astounding.  博物馆藏品的全面性令人惊叹。

* **Academic Context:** The research lacked comprehensiveness in its methodology. 这项研究的方法论缺乏全面性。

* **Business Context:** The company's new strategy emphasizes comprehensiveness in its market approach. 公司的新战略强调其市场方法的全面性。

* **In a Sentence with a Possessive Phrase:** The comprehensiveness of the plan's details was impressive. 计划细节的全面性令人印象深刻。  (Notice the use of "of" to show possession, not the apostrophe-s)


There is no need for a section on grammatical tenses, voices, etc., because "comprehensiveness's" is not a grammatically correct word.  The analysis focuses on the correctly formed word "comprehensiveness."
