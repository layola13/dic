chemosmosis:/ˌkɛmoʊˈsmoʊsɪs/| n. |化学渗透|The movement of ions across a selectively permeable membrane, down their electrochemical gradient. This movement is coupled to the synthesis of ATP.  It is a process that occurs in mitochondria and chloroplasts to generate ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the main energy currency of cells. |Chemosmosis is a crucial process in cellular respiration and photosynthesis.|  近义词：proton motive force (indirectly related)| 反义词：None directly applicable.


例句：

Chemiosmosis is the process that generates most of the ATP in cellular respiration. = 化学渗透作用是细胞呼吸过程中产生大部分ATP的过程。

The proton gradient created during electron transport drives chemiosmosis. = 电子传递过程中产生的质子梯度驱动化学渗透作用。


词源:

The word "chemosmosis" is a combination of "chemo-" (referring to chemical reactions) and "osmosis" (referring to the movement of water across a membrane).  It describes a process where chemical energy is used to drive the movement of ions across a membrane, similar to osmosis but driven by a chemical gradient rather than a water concentration gradient.


用法说明：

Chemosmosis is primarily used in biological contexts, specifically in the fields of cell biology, biochemistry, and related areas. It's a technical term describing a fundamental process in energy production within cells.  It is rarely used outside of scientific writing.  There are no common verb forms associated directly with "chemosmosis"; related verbs describe the processes involved, such as "to generate ATP via chemiosmosis."
