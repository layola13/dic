词源:
The word "redeliberate" is formed from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the verb "deliberate" (meaning "to consider carefully").  Therefore, it literally means "to consider again."  The root of "deliberate" traces back to Latin  *dēliberāre, from *dē- ("away") + *liberāre ("to weigh, consider").
