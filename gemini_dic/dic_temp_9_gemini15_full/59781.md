词源:

The word "ecoterrorism" is a compound word.  "Eco-" is a combining form derived from the Greek word "oikos" (οἶκος), meaning "house" or "dwelling," and later extended to mean "environment."  "Terrorism" comes from the French word "terrorisme," ultimately derived from the Latin word "terror," meaning "fear" or "dread."  Therefore, "ecoterrorism" literally means "environmental terrorism."
