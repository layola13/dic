The word "pshee" is not a standard English word found in dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  "Pshee" is likely:

1. **Onomatopoeia:** A word that imitates a sound.  It might represent a sound of air escaping, a soft hiss, or a similar brief, quiet sound.  In this case, there's no standard phonetic transcription, word class, or formal definition.

2. **Slang or informal expression:**  Its meaning would depend entirely on context and regional variations.  Without further context, its usage and meaning are undefined.


To provide an analysis, I'd need more information about where you encountered this word and the surrounding context.  If you can provide that, I may be able to offer a more specific interpretation.
