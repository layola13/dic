词源:

The word "developed" comes from the verb "develop," which itself has a long and complex etymology.  It ultimately traces back to the Old French word "developper," meaning "to unfold," "unroll," or "to spread out." This in turn is derived from the Latin prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart," "away") and the verb "volvere" (meaning "to roll").  The sense of growth and progress evolved from the original idea of unfolding or unfurling something.  The shift to describing economic and social advancement happened gradually over time.
