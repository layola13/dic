词源:
The word "cannon" ultimately derives from the Old French word "canon," meaning "tube" or "pipe," which itself came from the Latin word "canna," meaning "reed" or "cane."  The association stems from the resemblance of early cannons to large tubes or pipes.  The military meaning emerged in the 14th century, as larger, more powerful weapons were developed.
