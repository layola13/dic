/ɪnˈvɜːrtɪbrətˌnɛsɪz/ | n. | 无脊椎动物的特性；无脊椎动物的总称 (罕用) | The word "invertebratenesses" is a very uncommon and arguably incorrect pluralization of "invertebrate," referring to the qualities or characteristics of invertebrates or, less commonly, the collection of invertebrates themselves.  It's not a standard word and should generally be avoided in favor of clearer alternatives.  |  The study of the diverse invertebratenesses of the rainforest revealed a surprising number of new species. (This sentence uses the word, but it would be better written using "invertebrates" or "invertebrate characteristics"). |  invertebrate characteristics, invertebrate features | vertebrate characteristics | n.


USAGE->
This word is so rarely used that providing grammatical examples in various tenses is impractical and misleading.  The grammatical function would follow standard noun usage.  For example:

Singular Noun: The invertebrate's unique defense mechanism is fascinating. (这个无脊椎动物独特的防御机制令人着迷。)
Plural Noun (standard): The invertebrates of this ecosystem are highly diverse. (这个生态系统的无脊椎动物种类繁多。)

PHRASE->
Because "invertebratenesses" is not a standard word, there are no common phrases associated with it.  Phrases would be built around the more standard term "invertebrates".  Examples:

the diversity of invertebrates (无脊椎动物的多样性)
the role of invertebrates (无脊椎动物的作用)
invertebrate populations (无脊椎动物种群)
the study of invertebrates (无脊椎动物的研究)
conservation of invertebrates (无脊椎动物的保护)
