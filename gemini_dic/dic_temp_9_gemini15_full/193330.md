词源:
The word "seether" is a frequentative verb derived from the Old English word "seþan," meaning "to boil" or "to simmer."  The addition of the "-er" suffix indicates a continuous or repeated action, thus creating the sense of a slow, sustained boil or simmer, both literally and figuratively in terms of emotion.
