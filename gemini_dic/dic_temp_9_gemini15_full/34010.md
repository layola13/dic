citigrade:/ˈsɪtɪɡreɪd/ | adj. |摄氏的，百分度的|Celsius; relating to a temperature scale on which the freezing point of water is 0 degrees and the boiling point is 100 degrees at standard atmospheric pressure.|The temperature is 25 citigrade today.|近义词：Celsius, centigrade |反义词：Fahrenheit


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The water is boiling at 100 citigrade. = 水在100摄氏度沸腾。
The temperature outside is 20 citigrade. = 外面的温度是20摄氏度。


一般过去时:
The citigrade temperature yesterday was 30 degrees. = 昨天的摄氏温度是30度。
The experiment was conducted at 0 citigrade. = 实验在0摄氏度进行。


现在完成时:
The temperature has risen to 25 citigrade. = 温度已上升到25摄氏度。
We have observed significant changes at citigrade temperatures. = 我们已经观察到在摄氏温度下的显著变化。


过去完成时:
The ice had melted before the citigrade reading was taken. = 在进行摄氏读数之前，冰已经融化了。
The reaction had completed by the time the temperature reached 10 citigrade. = 当温度达到10摄氏度时，反应已经完成了。


将来时:
The temperature will reach 35 citigrade tomorrow. = 明天的温度将达到35摄氏度。
The experiment will be conducted at a constant citigrade temperature. = 实验将在恒定的摄氏温度下进行。


虚拟语气:
If the temperature were 0 citigrade, the water would freeze. = 如果温度是0摄氏度，水就会结冰。
I wish the temperature were lower than 25 citigrade. = 我希望温度低于25摄氏度。


被动语态:
The temperature was measured in citigrade. = 温度是用摄氏度测量的。
The experiment is being conducted at a controlled citigrade temperature. = 实验正在受控的摄氏温度下进行。


疑问句:
What is the citigrade temperature? = 摄氏温度是多少？
Is the water boiling at 100 citigrade? = 水是否在100摄氏度沸腾？


否定句:
The temperature is not above 0 citigrade. = 温度不高于0摄氏度。
The experiment was not conducted at a constant citigrade temperature. = 实验并非在恒定的摄氏温度下进行。


PHRASE->
citigrade scale = 摄氏温标
citigrade thermometer = 摄氏温度计
degrees citigrade = 摄氏度
citigrade reading = 摄氏读数
at citigrade = 在摄氏温度下
