词源：
The word "naturalized" comes from the Late Middle English word "naturalisen," ultimately derived from the Latin word "naturalis," meaning "of or relating to nature."  The suffix "-ize" indicates the action of making something or someone conform to a particular condition.  Therefore, "naturalized" originally referred to making something akin to nature or natural, but its modern usage primarily focuses on granting citizenship.
