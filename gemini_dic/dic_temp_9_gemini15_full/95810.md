词源:

The word "incoordinate" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "coordinate," which itself comes from the Latin words "co-" (meaning "together") and "ordinatus" (meaning "ordered" or "arranged").  Therefore, "incoordinate" literally means "not together ordered" or "lacking coordination."
