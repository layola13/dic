The word "preinventing" is a relatively recent coinage, formed by adding the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") to the verb "inventing".  There isn't a direct etymological history as a single established word, but rather a logical combination of existing morphemes.  It's understood within the context of technological advancement and future planning.  It doesn't have established grammatical tenses in the same way as regular verbs; its usage is mainly in the present and past participles.
