geodesics:/dʒiːˈɒzɪks/ | n. |测地线，最短路径 |The plural form of geodesic.  Geodesics are the shortest paths between two points on a curved surface, analogous to straight lines on a flat surface. In mathematics and physics, geodesics are fundamental concepts in geometry and relativity. They describe the paths followed by objects moving under the influence of gravity or other forces. |例句：The shortest distance between two points on a sphere is along a geodesic.  球面上两点间的最短距离是沿着测地线。

例句：Scientists use geodesics to model the trajectories of planets and stars.  科学家们用测地线来模拟行星和恒星的轨迹。

词源:  From Greek γεωδαισία (geodaisia), meaning "earth-division," from γῆ (gê), "earth," and δαίω (daio), "to divide."  The term originally referred to surveying and land measurement but has since been extended to its modern mathematical meaning.
