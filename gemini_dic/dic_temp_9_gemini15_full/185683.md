词源:

The word "reverse" comes from the Old French word "reverser," which itself derives from the Latin verb "revertere," meaning "to turn back" or "to return."  The prefix "re-" indicates "back" or "again," and the root "-vertere" is related to the verb "vertere," meaning "to turn."  Thus, the core meaning of "reverse" has consistently been about turning something back or around.
