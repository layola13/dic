词源:
The word "overinsolent" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much") and the adjective "insolent" (meaning "showing a rude and arrogant lack of respect").  "Insolent" itself derives from the Old French word "insolent," ultimately from the Latin "insolēns," meaning "unusual," "extraordinary," or "uncommon."  The meaning shifted over time to encompass the current sense of rudeness and disrespect.
