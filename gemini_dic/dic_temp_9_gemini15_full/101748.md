词性：名词


词源:

* **ir-**:  prefix meaning "not" or "without"
* **resolution**:  from Latin *resolvere* "to loosen, untie, dissolve," from *re-* "again" + *solvere* "to loosen."  The sense of "to solve" developed later, and from this came the meaning of "firm decision."

英文解析:

Irresolutions refers to a state of being unable to make a decision or to stick to a decision already made. It implies a lack of firmness of purpose, often leading to procrastination or inaction.  The plural form "irresolutions" suggests multiple instances of this indecisiveness or several unresolved issues.
