/dɪʃæluːsɪˈneɪʃən/ | n. |错觉，幻觉；虚幻的景象 |A dishallucination is a false sensory perception that is the opposite of a hallucination; it involves the absence of something expected or the misperception of something present.  For example, a person might experience a dishallucination of their own hand, failing to perceive it as being present, even though it is.  It is a relatively rare and under-researched phenomenon in psychology and neuroscience.  | The patient reported a dishallucination of their left arm, feeling as if it wasn't there despite visual confirmation. = 病人报告说他们的左臂出现了幻觉缺失，即使有视觉确认，也感觉不到它在那里。|  (近义词缺乏，因其为反义词的衍生词，与缺乏感知、感觉缺失等概念相关) | hallucination |  (词性为名词)
