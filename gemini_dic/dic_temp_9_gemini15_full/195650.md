The word "semirespectable" is a compound adjective formed by combining the prefix "semi-" (meaning "half," "partially," or "to a limited extent") with the adjective "respectable."  The word's etymology traces back to the Latin prefix "semi-" and the English word "respectable," which itself derives from the verb "respect" and the suffix "-able" (meaning "capable of being").  There is no significant historical or literary context to further elaborate on the word's development beyond its straightforward compositional origins.
