heterotricha: /ˌhɛtərəˈtraɪkə/ | n. | 异毛纲纤毛虫 | Heterotricha is a subclass of ciliates characterized by having two types of cilia: somatic cilia and oral cilia.  They are generally found in freshwater environments. | Example:  The researchers identified several new species of *Heterotricha* in the Amazon River basin.  研究人员在亚马逊河流域发现了几个新的异毛纲纤毛虫物种。|近义词:  (lacks direct synonyms due to taxonomic specificity)|反义词: (lacks direct antonyms due to taxonomic specificity)|名词
