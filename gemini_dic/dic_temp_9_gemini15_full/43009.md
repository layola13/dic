词源:
The word "coward" comes from the Old French word *couard*, which meant "tail-less," possibly referring to a docked dog, and later developed a metaphorical sense of "lacking spirit."  This is linked to the Old French word *coe*, meaning "tail." The connection between lacking a tail and lacking courage is obscure but likely involved the idea of a "truncated" or incomplete being, lacking the full strength and spirit of a complete animal.
