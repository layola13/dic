Etymology:

The word "lazy" ultimately derives from the Old English word "laþe," meaning "hateful," "detestable," or "unpleasant."  This original meaning evolved over time.  Through Middle English ("laþe," then "lazi"),  the sense shifted to describe something undesirable or unpleasant to do, ultimately leading to its current meaning of avoiding work or effort.  The semantic shift reflects a change in societal perception of idleness.
