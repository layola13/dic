词源:

The word "relay" originates from the Old French word "relais," meaning "a fresh horse or team to continue a journey," or "a stage in a journey."  This reflects the original use of relays in horse-drawn transportation, where fresh horses were used to continue a journey at different stages. The meaning later extended to include the transmission of messages or signals, and then to electrical relays and races.
