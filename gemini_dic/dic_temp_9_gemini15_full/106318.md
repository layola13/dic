词源:
The name "Kodak" was coined by George Eastman, the founder of the Eastman Kodak Company.  He wanted a name that was short, memorable, and easily pronounceable.  The "K" and "ak" sounds were chosen arbitrarily, while the "oda" was intended to sound strong and evocative.  There's no deeper meaning to the name beyond its marketing appeal.
