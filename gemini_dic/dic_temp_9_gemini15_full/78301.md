germline:/ˈdʒɜːrmlaɪn/|/ˈdʒɜːrmˌlaɪn/| n. |种系，生殖细胞系 |The germline refers to the lineage of cells that give rise to gametes (sperm and egg cells).  It encompasses all the cells that contribute to the genetic material passed from one generation to the next.  Mutations in the germline are heritable, meaning they can be passed on to offspring. |Example:  Genetic mutations in the germline can cause inherited diseases. 种系中的基因突变会导致遗传疾病。


The study of germline mutations is crucial for understanding inherited diseases. 对种系突变的研究对于理解遗传疾病至关重要。|近义词：germ plasm, reproductive lineage |反义词：somatic lineage

将来时:
Scientists will continue to study the germline for years to come. 科学家们将在未来数年继续研究种系。
They will sequence the germline to identify potential mutations. 他们将对种系进行测序以鉴定潜在的突变。


虚拟语气:
If the germline were damaged, the offspring could inherit diseases. 如果种系受损，后代可能会遗传疾病。
