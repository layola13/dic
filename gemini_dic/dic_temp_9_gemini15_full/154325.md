词源:
The word "periwinkle" ultimately derives from the Old French "pervinke,"  which in turn came from the Latin "vinca," referring to the periwinkle plant (Vinca minor) –  named for its twining, creeping growth habit similar to the snail's shell. The association likely arose due to the similar purplish-blue color shared by the flower and the snail.
