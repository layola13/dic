participles:/ˈpɑːrtɪsɪp(ə)lz/ | n. | 分词 |  Participles are words formed from verbs, and they function as both verbs and adjectives. They are used to create compound verb tenses and to add descriptive detail to sentences. There are two main types: present participles (ending in -ing) and past participles (often ending in -ed, -en, -t, or -n). Present participles describe actions happening at the same time as the main verb, while past participles describe actions completed before the main verb.  |
