Etymology:

The word "semigod" is a compound word formed from:

* **semi-**:  A prefix derived from Latin, meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."
* **god**:  An Old English word, ultimately of Germanic origin, referring to a supernatural being with great power and influence.

Therefore, "semigod" literally means "half-god" or "partly god," reflecting the hybrid nature of these beings in mythology and fiction.
