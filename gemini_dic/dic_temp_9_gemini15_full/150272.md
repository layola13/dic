词源:
The word "paned" derives from the Old French word "pane," meaning "a piece of cloth" or "a flat surface." This sense likely evolved from the use of thin, flat pieces of glass in windows, mirroring the flatness of cloth. Over time, "pane" came to specifically refer to a single section of a window or door, leading to the adjectival form "paned."
