词源:
The word "changeableness" is derived from the adjective "changeable," which itself comes from the verb "change" and the suffix "-able," indicating capacity or capability.  The further addition of "-ness" creates a noun, signifying the state or quality of being changeable.  The root "change" has Old English origins, tracing back to words like "cēangan," possibly related to Proto-Germanic roots.
