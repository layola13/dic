词源:
The word "marrowfat" is a compound word.  "Marrow" refers to the soft, fatty substance found in bones, and was likely used to describe the plump, full nature of the pea. "Fat" further emphasizes this richness and abundance.  The term likely emerged in the 17th century to describe this particularly large and succulent variety of pea.
