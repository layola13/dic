词源:
The word "knockoff" likely originated as slang in the mid-20th century. The "knock" part suggests a quick, possibly illicit, creation or copying, implying that the product was hastily made to resemble the original.  The "-off" suffix is a common addition to slang words, indicating a derivative or imitation.  There's no direct etymological link to a specific older word, but the meaning and structure strongly suggest its informal origins.
