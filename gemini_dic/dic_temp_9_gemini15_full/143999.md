词源:
The word "outreach" is a compound word formed from the preposition "out" and the noun "reach."  "Out" indicates extension or expansion beyond a limit, while "reach" implies the act of extending oneself to touch or grasp something.  Therefore, "outreach" literally means to extend one's reach beyond a usual limit, often to help or connect with others.
