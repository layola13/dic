hysteroepilepsy:/ˌhɪstɛroʊˈɛpɪlɛpsi/ | n. |歇斯底里性癫痫，癔病性癫痫 | A now-obsolete term for a condition characterized by seizures and other symptoms believed to be caused by psychological factors rather than neurological ones.  It was often diagnosed in women and was considered a form of hysteria. The term is now considered outdated and potentially offensive due to its association with sexist and stigmatizing views of mental illness. | Example:  The doctor initially diagnosed her condition as hysteroepilepsy, but further testing revealed a different neurological disorder.  医生最初诊断她的病情为歇斯底里性癫痫，但进一步的检查揭示了不同的神经系统疾病。|近义词:  (outdated and inaccurate) conversion disorder, psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES) |反义词:  (no true antonym, as it's an outdated term) epilepsy with a clear neurological basis |词性:名词
