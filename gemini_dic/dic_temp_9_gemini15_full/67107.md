explosibility: /ˌɛksploʊsəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 爆炸性；易爆性 | The capacity or tendency of a substance to explode.  It refers to the likelihood and intensity of an explosion under specific conditions. This includes factors such as the ease of ignition, the speed of reaction, and the amount of energy released. | 例句：The explosibility of the mixture depends on the ratio of fuel to oxidizer.  混合物的爆炸性取决于燃料与氧化剂的比例。

The high explosibility of the chemical necessitates careful handling.  这种化学物质的高爆炸性需要小心处理。


近义词：explosiveness, detonability | 反义词：stability, inertness


USAGE->

疑问句:
What is the explosibility of this chemical? = 这种化学物质的爆炸性是多少？
How can we reduce the explosibility of this fuel? = 我们如何降低这种燃料的爆炸性？


否定句:
The explosibility of this material is not significant. = 这种材料的爆炸性并不显著。
This compound does not exhibit high explosibility under normal conditions. =这种化合物在正常条件下不表现出高爆炸性。


PHRASE->
high explosibility = 高爆炸性
potential explosibility = 潜在爆炸性
limits of explosibility = 爆炸极限
test for explosibility = 爆炸性测试
degree of explosibility = 爆炸程度


词源:
explosibility is derived from the verb "explode," which comes from the Late Latin verb *explodere, meaning "to drive out," "to clap out," or "to make a loud noise." The "-ibility" suffix indicates capacity or tendency.
