词源:  The phrase is a simple combination of two common verbs: "pick" and "choose."  Both verbs have Old English roots. "Pick" derives from the Old English *piccian, meaning "to prick" or "to peck," and its sense of selecting evolved over time. "Choose" comes from the Old English *cēosan, meaning "to choose" or "to select."  The combined phrase emphasizes the act of careful selection from multiple options.
