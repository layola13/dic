This request is impossible to fulfill completely as the word "langue" is French, not English.  The formatting request is designed for English words and their grammatical usage.  A French word would require a different framework, including French grammar examples.

However, I can provide information about the French word "langue" following a modified version of your requested format:

**langue:** /lɑ̃ɡ/ | n. | 舌头；语言 | The tongue; a language. |  *Elle a une langue bien pendue.* (She has a sharp tongue.)  *La langue française est très belle.* (The French language is very beautiful.) |  bouche (mouth),  dialecte (dialect) |  (No direct antonym, but one could use  *silence*  in the context of "sharp tongue") | noun


**Etymology:** From Vulgar Latin *lingua*, from Latin *lingua* ("tongue, language").

**Usage Examples (French):**

I cannot provide English grammar examples using "langue" as it's a French word and doesn't directly conjugate or function within English grammar rules.  To get English grammar examples, you would need to provide an English word.
