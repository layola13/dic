prehallux:/ˌpriːˈhælʌks/| n. | 躔趾骨 |The prehallux is a rudimentary (vestigial) fifth toe located on the medial side of the hallux (big toe) in some primates.  It's a small, often underdeveloped bone or cartilage structure.  Its presence and development vary significantly across primate species. In humans, it is typically absent or represented only by soft tissue.  |例句：The presence of a prehallux is a key feature used in primate taxonomy and phylogenetic studies.  躔趾骨的存在是灵长类动物分类学和系统发育研究中的一个关键特征。

|近义词:|hallux, accessory bone|反义词:|hallux (in the context of its absence)|词性|n.|
