premorality: /ˌpriːmɔːˈrælɪti/ | n. | 道德前状态，道德萌芽期 | The state or period before the development of morality; the rudimentary or nascent stage of moral development.  It refers to the time before a person or society develops a fully formed moral system, often characterized by a lack of clear moral distinctions or a reliance on instinct or immediate consequences. | Example:  The child's behavior, while seemingly selfish, might be attributed to premorality, as they haven't yet internalized societal moral norms.  孩子的行为虽然看起来很自私，但可能是因为他们还没有内化社会道德规范，所以可以归因于道德前状态。| 近义词：amorality,  immorality (in the sense of lacking a developed moral system, not necessarily acting immorally), proto-morality | 反义词：morality, ethicality |
