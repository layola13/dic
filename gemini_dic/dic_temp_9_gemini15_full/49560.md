词源:
The word "demeanour" comes from the Old French word "demeineure," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "dominus," meaning "master" or "lord."  The original sense referred to the way a lord conducted himself, implying a certain authority and bearing.  Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass the general outward behavior and manner of any person.
