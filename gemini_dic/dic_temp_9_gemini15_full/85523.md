The word "hataki" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be of Japanese origin.  Therefore, a traditional English word analysis is not possible.  To provide a response, I need more context or information about where you encountered this word.  Is it a loanword used in a specific English dialect or context?  If you can provide more information, I can try to give you a more accurate description.
