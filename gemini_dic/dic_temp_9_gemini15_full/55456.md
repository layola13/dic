词源:
The word "distinguishers" is derived from the verb "distinguish," which comes from the Old French word "distinguer," meaning "to separate, distinguish."  This in turn originates from the Latin word "distinguere,"  a compound of "dis-" (apart) and "distinguere" (to prick, mark).  The suffix "-ers" forms a plural noun denoting those who or that which perform the action of distinguishing.
