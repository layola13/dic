enclitically:/ɛnˈklɪtɪkli/ | adv. | 附着地，附着性地 |  An enclitic is a word that is phonologically bound to another word, typically a preceding one, modifying or adding to its meaning.  It's a word that's stressed less than the word it's attached to, often losing its own independent stress and possibly some sounds.  The term is primarily used in linguistics and morphology.  | Example:  In some languages, pronouns might be enclitic; they "cling" to the verb.  For instance,  "I'm" (I am) - "am" is partially enclitic to "I". However, the English "am" is more appropriately described as a weak form, rather than a true enclitic.  True enclitics are more common in languages with a different stress system than English. | 近义词:  clitically (though clitic is the noun form) | 反义词:  N/A (the antonym would describe a word's independent stress and pronunciation) | 词性: 副词
