词源:  The word "open-handed" is a compound adjective.  "Open" signifies freedom from concealment or restriction, while "handed" refers to the action or manner of giving or dealing with something. The combination suggests a generous and unrestrained manner of giving.  The etymology traces back to the Old English word "open," meaning "not closed, unconfined," and "hand," from the Proto-Germanic "*handuz," meaning "hand."  The "-ed" suffix transforms the noun "hand" into an adjectival form describing a characteristic associated with the hand's action.
