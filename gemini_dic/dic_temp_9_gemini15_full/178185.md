recombination:/ˌriːkɒmbɪˈneɪʃən/|/ˌriːkɑːm.bɪˈneɪʃən/| n. |重组；基因重组 |The process by which genetic material is rearranged during sexual reproduction, resulting in offspring with combinations of traits different from either parent.  This includes the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during meiosis (crossing over) and the independent assortment of chromosomes.  It also refers to the artificial joining of DNA segments from different sources. | Example: Genetic recombination is essential for evolution and adaptation.  基因重组对于进化和适应至关重要。

The process of combining different elements or characteristics to create something new.  The combining of genes or characters different from what they were in the parents. | Example: The recombination of ideas led to a breakthrough in the research.  思想的重组导致了研究的突破。|近义词：reorganization, restructuring, rearrangement, combination |反义词：separation, segregation, isolation
