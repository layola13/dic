词源:
The word "doodle" likely originated in the early 19th century as a variant of the word "dodel," meaning "a small thing."  Its modern meaning of a careless drawing developed over time.  The exact etymology is uncertain, but it's thought to be of imitative origin, reflecting the sound of someone idly drawing.
