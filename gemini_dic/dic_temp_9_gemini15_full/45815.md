词源:

The word "customableness" is derived from the word "custom" (meaning a practice, habit, or usage, often of a particular group of people) and the suffix "-able" (meaning capable of being).  The addition of "-ness" forms a noun, indicating a state or quality.  Thus, "customableness" signifies the quality or state of being customizable.
