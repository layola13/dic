Word Origin:

The word "interradiations" is formed from:

* **inter-**:  A prefix meaning "between," "among," or "reciprocally."
* **radiat-**:  From the Latin word "radiare," meaning "to shine," "to radiate," or "to spread out."
* **-ion**: A suffix forming nouns indicating an action or process.

Therefore, "interradiations" literally means the reciprocal action or process of radiating or spreading out between or among things.
