USAGE->
This word is a technical term and doesn't have typical grammatical usage examples like "what" in the provided template.  It's used primarily in programming and database contexts.  Therefore, example sentences will focus on its application in those fields.


In Programming (Python example):
```python
my_list = [1, 2, None, 4]
nonvoids = [x for x in my_list if x is not None] #This creates a new list containing only non-None values.
print(nonvoids)  # Output: [1, 2, 4]

```
中文：我的列表包含1, 2, None, 4。  nonvoids变量包含列表中非None的值。输出结果为：[1,2,4]


In Database Queries (SQL example):
```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE column_name IS NOT NULL;
```
中文：从my_table表中选择所有column_name字段非NULL的行。


In Database Queries (Conceptual example):
The report showed that all the fields contained nonvoids indicating complete data entry for all records.
中文：报告显示所有字段都包含非空值，表明所有记录的数据输入完整。



PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "nonvoids" as it's a highly technical term.  Phrases would relate to the concept, not the word itself. For example:

valid data,  populated fields,  non-null entries, meaningful values,  data integrity.
