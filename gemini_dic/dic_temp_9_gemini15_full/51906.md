The word "dhony" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (like a name), a word from a non-English language, or a neologism (newly coined word) not yet widely recognized.

To provide the requested analysis, I would need more context about where you encountered this word.  Knowing its source will help determine its meaning and allow for a proper explanation.
