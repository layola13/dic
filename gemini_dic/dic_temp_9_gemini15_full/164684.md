The word "preexpresses" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  However, we can analyze what it *might* mean based on its constituent parts:

* **pre-**:  prefix meaning "before," "prior to," or "in front of."
* **expresses**:  verb, third-person singular present tense of "express," meaning "to convey or communicate (a feeling, thought, or fact)."

Therefore, "preexpresses" could *potentially* mean "expresses beforehand," "expresses in advance," or "conveys or communicates something before [something else]."  However, without context or further information, its meaning remains speculative and its usage grammatically questionable.
