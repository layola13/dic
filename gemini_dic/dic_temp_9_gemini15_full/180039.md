reflectance:/rɪˈflɛktəns/| n. |反射率，反射系数 |The ratio of reflected radiation to incident radiation.  It describes the proportion of light or other radiation that is reflected by a surface.  Reflectance values typically range from 0 (no reflection) to 1 (total reflection).| Example: The reflectance of snow is very high, making it appear bright white. 雪的反射率很高，使它看起来是明亮的白色。 The dark asphalt had a low reflectance.  黑暗的沥青反射率很低。|近义词：reflectivity |反义词：absorption |名词
