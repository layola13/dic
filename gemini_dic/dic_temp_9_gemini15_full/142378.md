orthorhombic: /ˌɔːrθoʊˈrɒmbɪk/ | adj. | 正交的，斜方晶系的 |

英文解析: Relating to or denoting the orthorhombic crystal system, characterized by three unequal axes at right angles.  Orthorhombic crystals have three axes of different lengths, all at right angles to each other. This is one of the seven crystal systems.

例句:
The mineral displayed a distinct orthorhombic crystal structure. = 这种矿物呈现出明显的斜方晶系晶体结构。

The orthorhombic symmetry of the building was visually striking. = 建筑物的正交对称性在视觉上非常醒目。


近义词: rectangular (in some contexts)

反义词:  There isn't a direct antonym, but terms describing other crystal systems (e.g., cubic, tetragonal, monoclinic) could be considered contrasting.

词性: adjective


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The crystal structure is orthorhombic. = 晶体结构是斜方晶系的。

疑问句:
Is the crystal system orthorhombic? = 晶系是斜方晶系的吗？
Are the axes of this crystal orthorhombic? = 这个晶体的轴是正交的吗？


否定句:
The structure is not orthorhombic; it's monoclinic. = 该结构不是斜方晶系的；它是单斜晶系的。
The crystal system is not orthorhombic, but rather cubic. = 晶系不是斜方晶系的，而是立方晶系的。



PHRASE->
There are not common phrases directly using "orthorhombic," as it's a highly specialized term.  Phrases would typically involve the word in a descriptive context within a scientific or technical field.  For example:  "orthorhombic crystal lattice," "orthorhombic phase transition," "orthorhombic distortion," "orthorhombic symmetry group," "orthorhombic perovskite".
