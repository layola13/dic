词源:
The word "compass" comes from the Old French word "compass," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "compāssare," meaning "to embrace," "to encircle," or "to measure."  The nautical meaning developed due to the instrument's ability to encompass and determine direction.  The drawing instrument meaning evolved from its ability to "encompass" a circle.
