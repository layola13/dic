The word "mindes" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please double-check the spelling.  Perhaps you meant "minds," "mind's,"  or a word with a similar sound.
* **A neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or a word used within a very specific community or context.  If this is the case, more context is needed to understand its meaning and usage.
* **A word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language, requiring information about the language of origin.


To provide the analysis you requested, I need the correct spelling or more context about where you encountered this word.
