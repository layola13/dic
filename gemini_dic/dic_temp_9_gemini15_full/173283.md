词源:  "Quasi-" comes from Latin, meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."  "Contractual" derives from "contract," which itself has origins in Old French and ultimately Latin, relating to agreements or deals.  Therefore, "quasi-contractual" describes something that has the characteristics of a contract but lacks the formal elements.
