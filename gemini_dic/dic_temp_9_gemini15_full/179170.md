redilating: /ˌriːˈdaɪleɪtɪŋ/ | v. | 再扩张；重新扩张 |  The act of dilating again; expanding or widening once more.  This word is not a standard dictionary entry and is likely a newly coined word or a misspelling. It's formed by combining "re-" (again) and "dilating" (expanding or widening). Therefore, its meaning can be inferred.  | Example: After the initial contraction, the pupil began redilating.  (瞳孔初次收缩后，又开始扩张。) | 近义词：re-expanding, re-widening | 反义词：re-contracting, re-narrowing
