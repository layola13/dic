词源:
The word "gaucheness" derives from the French word "gauche," meaning "left," "awkward," or "clumsy."  This is linked to the fact that in many cultures, the left hand is considered less refined or less skillful than the right.  The French word's meaning evolved to encompass a broader sense of social awkwardness.  The English word "gauche" then evolved into "gaucheness", meaning the state or quality of being gauche.
