The word "prejurisdictions" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, or possibly a misspelling.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  However, we can analyze its potential meaning based on its components:

* **pre-**:  /ˈpriː/ | Prefix |  之前，预先 | Before, in advance, prior to.

* **jurisdictions**: /ˌdʒʊərɪsˈdɪkʃənz/ | Noun | 司法管辖区，权限 | The authority to interpret and apply the law; the geographical area over which such authority extends.


Therefore, "prejurisdictions" *could* potentially refer to:
