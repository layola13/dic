词源:
The word "destabilization" is derived from the verb "destabilize," which itself comes from the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "reverse") and the word "stabilize."  "Stabilize" ultimately has roots in the Latin word "stabilis," meaning "firm" or "steady."  Therefore, "destabilization" literally means the act of removing or reversing stability.
