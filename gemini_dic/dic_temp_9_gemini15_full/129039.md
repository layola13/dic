nitraniline:/ˌnaɪtrəˈænɪliːn/| n. |硝基苯胺|Nitroaniline is a group of organic compounds that are derivatives of aniline with one or more nitro groups (-NO2) attached to the benzene ring.  They are important intermediates in the synthesis of dyes, pigments, and other chemicals. Different isomers exist depending on the position of the nitro group(s) on the benzene ring (ortho, meta, para).|Example: 2-Nitraniline is used in the production of azo dyes.|近义词：aminonitrobenzene|反义词：无
