词源: The term originates from "hot dog," a popular food item. The "-er" suffix transforms the noun into someone who does something related to hot dogs. The informal meaning evolved to describe someone who is boastful or showy, possibly referencing the flamboyant nature of some hot dog vendors.  The transition in meaning likely reflects a metaphorical association between the enthusiastic selling of hot dogs and an overly confident or self-promoting personality.
