manifolds:/ˈmænɪfoʊldz/ | n. |流形；歧管 | A manifold is a topological space that locally resembles Euclidean space near each point.  It's a generalization of curves and surfaces to higher dimensions.  In mathematics, manifolds are fundamental objects of study in various fields, including differential geometry, topology, and algebraic geometry. They are used to model a wide range of phenomena, from the shape of physical objects to abstract mathematical structures. | Example:  The surface of a sphere is a two-dimensional manifold.  球面的表面是一个二维流形。


Riemannian manifolds are particularly important in physics, as they provide a mathematical framework for describing spacetime in general relativity.黎曼流形在物理学中尤为重要，因为它们为描述广义相对论中的时空提供了数学框架。|近义词：variety, surface (in certain contexts) |反义词：N/A
