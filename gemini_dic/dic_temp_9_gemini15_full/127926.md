neomorph:/ˈniːoʊmɔːrf/| n. |新生形态，新形态|A neomorph is a new morphological feature that appears in a lineage, often as a result of mutation or other genetic changes.  It's a novel trait not present in the ancestor.  The term is often used in evolutionary biology and phylogenetics.|Example: The iridescent scales of the butterfly are considered a neomorph, a newly evolved characteristic not found in its ancestors.|近义词：novelty, innovation|反义词：plesiomorphy (ancestral trait)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The new species exhibits several neomorphs. = 新物种展现出几种新生形态。
This gene mutation produces a distinct neomorph. = 这种基因突变产生了一种独特的新的形态特征。

一般过去时:
Researchers identified a significant neomorph in the fossil. = 研究人员在化石中发现了重要的新的形态特征。
The evolutionary event introduced a novel neomorph. = 进化事件引入了一种新的形态特征。


现在完成时:
Scientists have documented many neomorphs in recent years. = 科学家们近年来已经记录了许多新生形态。
The study has revealed a surprising neomorph in the organism's development. = 这项研究揭示了该生物发育过程中一个令人惊讶的新形态特征。


过去完成时:
Before the mutation, the neomorph had not been present. = 在突变之前，这种新的形态特征并不存在。
The ancestor lacked the neomorph that evolved later. = 祖先缺乏后来进化出来的这种新的形态特征。


将来时:
Further research will identify more neomorphs. = 进一步的研究将鉴定出更多新生形态。
We predict this gene will lead to a new neomorph in the next generation. = 我们预测这个基因将在下一代产生一个新的形态特征。


虚拟语气:
If the mutation occurred, a new neomorph would likely develop. = 如果发生突变，很可能会产生新的形态特征。
It is hypothesized that if the environmental conditions changed, a new neomorph might have evolved. = 假设如果环境条件改变，可能就会进化出新的形态特征。


被动语态:
The neomorph was identified through genetic analysis. = 新的形态特征是通过基因分析鉴定的。
Several new neomorphs are being studied by researchers. = 研究人员正在研究几种新的形态特征。


疑问句:
What neomorphs are present in this species? = 这个物种有哪些新生形态？
Are these features truly neomorphs or modifications of existing structures? = 这些特征真的是新生形态还是现有结构的修改？


否定句:
This trait is not a neomorph; it's an ancestral characteristic. = 这个特征不是新生形态；它是祖先的特征。
The analysis did not reveal any significant neomorphs. = 分析没有发现任何重要的新的形态特征。



PHRASE->
neomorph evolution = 新形态进化
the origin of neomorphs = 新形态的起源
neomorph function = 新形态的功能
identification of neomorphs = 新形态的鉴定
molecular basis of neomorphs = 新形态的分子基础
