lambda's: /ˈlæmdəz/ | n. | λ的；拉姆达的 |  The possessive form of "lambda," referring to the Greek letter λ (lambda) used in various contexts, particularly in mathematics, computer science (especially in lambda calculus), and physics.  It often denotes an anonymous function or a wavelength. | Example:  The lambda's value in this equation is crucial.  在这个等式中，λ的值至关重要。 | 近义词:  (depending on context)  function, wavelength, expression | 反义词: N/A


USAGE->
This word is primarily used as a possessive and does not conjugate like a verb or function as an adjective in the typical sense.  Therefore, standard tense conjugations are not applicable.  The usage is entirely contextual, depending on the field in which "lambda" is being used.

Example 1 (Mathematics):  The lambda's properties determine the solution. λ的性质决定了解的方案。

Example 2 (Computer Science): We're defining the lambda's parameters. 我们正在定义λ的参数。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "lambda's" as a possessive.  Phrases involving "lambda" itself would be used instead, and their meaning will vary greatly based on the context (mathematics, physics, computer science etc.).

Example 1 (Computer Science):  "Lambda expression"  λ表达式

Example 2 (Physics): "Lambda wavelength" λ波长
