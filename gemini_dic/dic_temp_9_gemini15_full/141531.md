opponency:/ˈɑːpənənsi/| n. |对抗；对立；拮抗作用 |The phenomenon where two opposing processes or elements interact or are balanced.  This term is often used in neuroscience and color vision to describe the way opposing neural signals interact. For example, in color vision, the opponency theory suggests that color perception is based on opposing pairs of colors, such as red-green and blue-yellow. |Example: The study investigated the role of neural opponency in visual perception. 这项研究调查了神经对抗在视觉感知中的作用。|近义词：antagonism, opposition, counteraction |反义词：harmony, agreement, cooperation |名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Opponency plays a crucial role in color vision. = 对抗作用在颜色视觉中起着至关重要的作用。
The researchers are studying the opponency of different neural pathways. = 研究人员正在研究不同神经通路的对抗作用。


一般过去时:
The experiment demonstrated clear evidence of opponency. = 实验清楚地证明了对抗作用的存在。
Scientists previously believed that opponency was limited to the visual system. = 科学家以前认为对抗作用仅限于视觉系统。


现在完成时:
Studies have shown the importance of opponency in many biological systems. = 研究表明，对抗作用在许多生物系统中都很重要。

过去完成时:
Before this study, the mechanism of opponency was not fully understood. = 在这项研究之前，对抗作用的机制尚未完全了解。
They had already established the existence of opponency in their previous work. = 他们之前的工作已经证实了对抗作用的存在。


将来时:
Future research will explore the implications of opponency in other sensory systems. = 未来的研究将探索对抗作用在其他感觉系统中的意义。
Scientists will investigate how opponency contributes to perception and behavior. = 科学家将研究对抗作用如何促进感知和行为。


虚拟语气:
If there were no opponency, color perception would be different. = 如果没有对抗作用，颜色感知就会不同。
It is as if the system were designed based on the principle of opponency. = 就好像这个系统是基于对抗作用的原理设计的。


被动语态:
Opponency was initially observed in the retina. = 对抗作用最初是在视网膜中观察到的。
The effects of opponency are being investigated in various contexts. = 对抗作用的影响正在各种情况下被研究。


疑问句:
What is the role of opponency in the brain? = 对抗作用在大脑中的作用是什么？

否定句:
The theory does not fully explain all aspects of opponency. = 该理论并没有完全解释对抗作用的所有方面。
There is no clear evidence of opponency in this particular case. = 在这种特定情况下，没有明确的对抗作用证据。
