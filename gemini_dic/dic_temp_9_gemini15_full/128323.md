neurotransmitters:/ˌnʊroʊtrænzˈmɪtərz/ | n. |神经递质 |Chemical messengers that transmit signals across a synapse (the gap between two nerve cells) in the nervous system.  They are released from the axon terminal of a neuron and bind to receptors on the dendrite of another neuron, muscle cell, or gland cell, triggering a response. | Example:  Dopamine and serotonin are important neurotransmitters involved in mood regulation. 多巴胺和血清素是参与情绪调节的重要神经递质。


The release of neurotransmitters is crucial for communication between nerve cells. 神经递质的释放对于神经细胞之间的交流至关重要。


近义词:  synaptic transmitters, neuromodulators (although neuromodulators have broader effects)


反义词:  There isn't a direct antonym, as it's more about the absence or dysfunction of neurotransmitters.  Terms like "neurotransmitter deficiency" or "neurotransmitter dysfunction" could be considered opposites in a functional sense.
