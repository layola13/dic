micro-metres: /ˈmaɪkroʊˌmiːtərz/ | n. | 微米 | A micrometre (also micron) is a unit of length equal to one millionth of a metre (10⁻⁶ m).  It's commonly used to measure very small objects or distances, such as the diameter of a human hair or the wavelength of light. | The diameter of a human hair is approximately 50 to 100 micrometres.  The wavelength of visible light ranges from approximately 400 to 700 micrometres. | 近义词: micron | 反义词: (no direct antonym, as it's a unit of measurement) | 名词
