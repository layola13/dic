词源:

From *martyr* + *-ly*.  The word "martyr" comes from the Greek word μάρτυς (martys), meaning "witness".  Early Christians who died for their faith were called martyrs because they bore witness to their beliefs through death.  The suffix "-ly" transforms the noun "martyr" into an adjective, describing something that is like or characteristic of a martyr.
