psychrometer:/saɪˈkrɒmɪtər/| n. |干湿球湿度计|A psychrometer is a meteorological instrument used to measure atmospheric humidity. It typically consists of two thermometers, one with a dry bulb and the other with a wet bulb. The difference in readings between the two thermometers is used to determine the relative humidity.  |Example: The meteorologist used a psychrometer to determine the relative humidity of the air.|近义词：hygrometer|反义词：无

词源:
The word "psychrometer" comes from the Greek words "psychos" (ψυχρός), meaning "cold," and "metron" (μέτρον), meaning "measure."  It refers to the cooling effect of evaporation on the wet-bulb thermometer.
