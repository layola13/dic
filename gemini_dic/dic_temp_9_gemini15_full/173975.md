词源:  The word is a combination of "quasi," meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent," and "strenuous," meaning "needing or using a lot of effort; laborious."  Therefore, "quasi-strenuous" literally means "seemingly strenuous" or "to a certain extent strenuous."  The word's origin lies in the Latin word "quasi," meaning "as if," and the English word "strenuous," derived from the Latin "strenuus," meaning "active," "vigorous," or "energetic."
