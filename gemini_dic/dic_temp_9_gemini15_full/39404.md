conk's:/kɒŋks/| n. |康克斯（姓氏）|Conk's is a surname, meaning it is a family name.| The Conk's family reunion was held last weekend. |  |  | noun


This word requires further context.  "Conk's" by itself is not a standard English word. It's most likely a proper noun, specifically a surname.  Therefore, providing grammatical tenses, phrases, etc., as requested for a typical verb or noun is not applicable.  The example provided in the prompt is a flawed model for this word.  A surname doesn't have conjugations or common phrases associated with it in the same way a regular verb or noun does.
