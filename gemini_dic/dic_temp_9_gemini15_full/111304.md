词源:

From Late Latin *liturgicus, from Greek λειτουργικός (leitourgikós), from λειτουργία (leitourgía) "public service, liturgy".  The Greek word ultimately derives from  λειτουργός (leitourgós) "public servant," from  λειτουργεῖν (leiturgein) "to perform public service," from  λεῖτος (leitos) "public" +  ἔργον (ergon) "work".
