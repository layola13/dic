词源:
The word "self-evident" is a compound word.  "Self" means "by itself" or "of itself," and "evident" means "clear" or "obvious."  Therefore, "self-evident" literally means "clearly true by itself."  The term's usage solidified in philosophy, particularly after its prominent appearance in the United States Declaration of Independence.
