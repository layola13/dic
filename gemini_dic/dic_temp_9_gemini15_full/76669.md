词源：
From the name Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), an Italian physician and physicist whose experiments with frog legs led to the discovery of galvanism (the effects of electric current on living tissue).  The word initially referred to the effects of electricity, later extending to its metaphorical meaning of exciting or stimulating into action.
