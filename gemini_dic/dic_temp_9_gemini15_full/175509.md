词源:  The word "ramshackly" is believed to have originated from the combination of "ram" (meaning to strike or push forcefully) and "shackle" (meaning a fastening or restraint).  The original meaning likely referred to something loosely put together and liable to fall apart, as if its parts were merely rammed together and held by weak shackles.  The exact etymology is uncertain, however.
