词源:
The word "forthright" comes from the Old English words "forth" meaning "forward" or "outward" and "right" meaning "straight" or "correct".  Therefore, the literal meaning is "straight forward".  Over time, the meaning evolved to describe someone's manner of speaking or acting as direct and honest.
