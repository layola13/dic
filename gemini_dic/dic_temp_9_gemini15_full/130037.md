词源:  The word "non-partisan" is a compound word.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "partisan" comes from the French word "partisan," meaning "supporter of a party."  Therefore, "non-partisan" literally means "not a supporter of a party."  The ultimate root is likely the Latin word "pars," meaning "part."
