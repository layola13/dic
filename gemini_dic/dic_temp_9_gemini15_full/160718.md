词源:

Portraiture derives from the word "portrait," which comes from the Old French "portraicture," ultimately from the Latin "protrahere," meaning "to draw forth," "to portray," or "to represent."  The suffix "-ure" denotes the act or process of doing something.  Therefore, portraiture signifies the act or process of creating portraits.
