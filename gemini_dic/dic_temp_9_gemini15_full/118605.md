词源:
The term "message-boards" is a compound noun.  "Message" derives from Old French *message, ultimately from Latin *mittere "to send." "Boards" refers to a flat piece of wood, but in this context, it represents an online platform or area for communication, similar to a physical notice board.  The hyphen indicates that it's a single concept.
