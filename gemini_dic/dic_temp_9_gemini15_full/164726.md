USAGE->

This word is primarily used in technical contexts and doesn't lend itself to typical grammatical tense variations like the example provided.  The word itself describes a state or process, not an action that changes over time.  Therefore, providing examples for tenses is not applicable.  Instead, here are examples demonstrating its use in different sentence structures:


Declarative sentence: The audio engineer used prefading to minimize distortion during the mix. 音频工程师使用预先衰减来最小化混音过程中的失真。

Interrogative sentence: Was prefading employed in the broadcast of that radio show?  那个广播节目中使用了预先衰减吗？


Exclamatory sentence: What a smooth transition! The prefading was expertly done!  多么平滑的过渡！预先衰减做得非常专业！
