词源：

The word "diversiform" is a combination of two elements:

* **diversi-**: This prefix comes from the Latin word "diversus," meaning "turned in different directions," "different," or "various."

* **-form**: This suffix comes from the Latin word "forma," meaning "shape," "form," or "appearance."


因此，"diversiform"字面意思是“具有多种形式的”。


用法说明:

diversiform 主要用作形容词，描述事物具有多种形式、类型或特征。它强调多样性和变化性。


(由于diversiform本身是形容词，没有动词或名词用法，因此不需要提供动词或名词的语法例句。)
