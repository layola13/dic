词源：
The word "datableness" is a relatively recent coinage, formed by adding the suffix "-ableness" (indicating capacity or capability) to the noun "data."  The suffix "-able" is of Old English origin and was combined with "data," which itself is a relatively modern word (plural of "datum," from Latin).  Therefore, the word's etymology is a combination of older English grammatical components and a more recently adopted Latinate noun.
