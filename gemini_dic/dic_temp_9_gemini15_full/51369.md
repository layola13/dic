词源:  The word "deteriorator" is derived from the verb "deteriorate," which comes from the Late Latin word "deteriorare," meaning "to make worse."  This, in turn, is composed of the prefix "de-" (down, away) and "terior" (worse, inferior).  Thus, the word's roots indicate a process of making something worse or inferior.
