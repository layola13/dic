Etymology:

The word "mellifluousnesses" is derived from the adjective "mellifluous."  "Mellifluous" itself comes from the Latin words:

* "mel" (honey)
* "fluo" (flow)

Therefore, "mellifluous" literally means "flowing like honey," implying a smooth, sweet, and pleasing sound or quality. The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being mellifluous. Adding "-es" creates the plural form.
