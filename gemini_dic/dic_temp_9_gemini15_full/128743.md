词源：The word "niggardly" comes from the Old English word "nigon," meaning "miser," or "stingy." Over time, it evolved into the Middle English "nigard," and eventually to the modern "niggardly."  The etymology is unrelated to the racial slur, though the similarity has led to its avoidance in modern usage.
