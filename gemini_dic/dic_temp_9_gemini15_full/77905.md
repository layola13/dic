geniohyoid:/ˌdʒɛniˈɔɪd/| n. |颏舌骨肌|The geniohyoid is a small, strap-like muscle located in the floor of the mouth. It originates from the inner surface of the mandible (lower jawbone) near the symphysis menti (the point where the two halves of the mandible meet) and inserts into the hyoid bone.  Its primary function is to elevate the hyoid bone and depress the mandible. It plays a role in swallowing, speaking, and maintaining the position of the tongue. |例句：The geniohyoid muscle assists in swallowing by pulling the hyoid bone upward and forward.|近义词：mylohyoid (partially)|反义词：None directly opposing, but muscles with opposing actions include the infrahyoid muscles.|

词源:
The word "geniohyoid" is a compound word formed from Greek roots:

* **genio-**: from γένειον (geneion), meaning "chin" or "mentum."
* **hyoid-**: from ὑοειδής (hyoeidēs), meaning "hyoid-shaped" or referring to the hyoid bone.


The term thus literally means "chin-hyoid muscle," accurately reflecting its anatomical location and attachment points.
