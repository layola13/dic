词源:  The word "composedness" is derived from the verb "compose," meaning "to put together" or "to settle or calm (oneself)."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun, indicating the state or quality of being composed.  Ultimately, its roots trace back to the Latin "compōnere," meaning "to put together," combining "com-" (together) and "pōnere" (to put, place).
