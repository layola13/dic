USAGE->
This word is a literary term and doesn't have typical grammatical tenses or voice usage like verbs.  It describes a stylistic choice in writing.


PHRASE->
Diacope is not typically used in phrases in the same way as common words. Its usage is about the structure of sentences, not the combination of words into set phrases.  Examples of diacope in phrases would be illustrative examples within sentences, not separate phrases themselves. For example:

* "Alone, alone, all, all alone"  (Edgar Allan Poe) - This is a diacope example incorporated into a phrase within a larger sentence.
