词源:
The word "panhandler" is a compound word.  "Pan" refers to a cooking pan, and the implication is that panhandlers would use a pan to collect alms (charitable donations).  The "handler" part signifies that they handle or manage the pan as a means of collecting money.  The exact origin is difficult to pinpoint, but its usage dates back to the late 19th century in American English.
