词源:
The word "invest" comes from the Old French word "investir," meaning "to clothe," "to dress," or "to adorn."  This meaning evolved from the Latin word "vestire," meaning "to clothe." The modern financial meaning developed over time, with the initial sense suggesting the "clothing" or "endowment" of something with capital or resources.  The transition reflects the idea of providing something with resources to enhance or improve it, akin to dressing or adorning it.
