词源:

The word "proconciliation" is a relatively modern coinage.  It's formed by combining the prefix "pro-" (meaning "in favor of," "supporting," or "forward") with "conciliation" (from Latin *conciliare,  meaning "to bring together," "to reconcile").  Therefore, "proconciliation" literally means "in favor of reconciliation" or "the act of promoting reconciliation".
