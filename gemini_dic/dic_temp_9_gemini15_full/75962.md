词源:  The word "funky" originates from the early 20th century African American Vernacular English (AAVE). Its initial meaning was related to a musty or unpleasant smell. However, over time, its meaning shifted to describe something distinctive, stylish, and exciting, particularly in music and fashion. This evolution is believed to have been influenced by the development of funk music in the 1960s and 70s, which was characterized by its rhythmic groove and unconventional style.  The superlative "funkiest" simply intensifies this meaning.
