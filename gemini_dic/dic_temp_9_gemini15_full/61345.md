词源:

The word "embed" comes from the Old English "embydan," meaning "to set, or fix firmly."  The prefix "em-" is an intensifying prefix, and "-bed" comes from the Old English "bedd," meaning "bed" or "foundation."  Thus, the original meaning suggests something firmly fixed in its place, like being firmly bedded down.  The modern usage retains this sense of firm fixing, but extends it to include digital and abstract contexts.
