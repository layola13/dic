词源:
The word "mercy" comes from the Old French word "merci," meaning "thanks," "reward," or "grace."  This in turn derives from the Latin word "mercedem," meaning "reward," "payment," or "wages."  The shift in meaning from reward to compassion likely occurred through the association of divine grace and forgiveness with reward in a spiritual sense.
