polyspike:/ˈpɒliˌspaɪk/| n.|多尖峰；多峰值|A polyspike refers to a waveform or signal characterized by multiple sharp peaks or spikes.  It's often used in fields like neuroscience to describe patterns of electrical activity in the brain, specifically referring to the simultaneous firing of multiple neurons resulting in a complex signal with several distinct peaks.  The term implies a pattern distinct from a single spike or a smoothly varying signal.|例句：The EEG recording showed a polyspike pattern consistent with an epileptic seizure.  脑电图记录显示多峰值模式与癫痫发作一致。 The researcher observed a polyspike discharge in the hippocampal region. 研究人员在海马区观察到多尖峰放电。|近义词：multispike, complex waveform|反义词：monospike, smooth waveform|名词
