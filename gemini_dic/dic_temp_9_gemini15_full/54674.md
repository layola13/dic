PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "disoppilate".  The word itself is uncommon.  Phrases would be constructed around the meaning, such as: "to disoppilate a blockage," "to disoppilate the system," etc.


词源:  The word comes from the Latin prefix "dis-" (away, apart) and "oppilare" (to obstruct, to block).  Therefore, "disoppilate" literally means "to unblock."
