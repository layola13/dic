The word "congreet" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis.  A similar-sounding word might have been misspelled or it might be a neologism (newly coined word) not yet widely used.
