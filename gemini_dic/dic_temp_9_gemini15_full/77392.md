gauss:/ɡaʊs/| n. |高斯，高斯单位|A unit of magnetic flux density in the centimetre-gram-second (CGS) system of units, equal to one maxwell per square centimetre.  It is named after the German mathematician and physicist Carl Friedrich Gauss.  In the SI system, the tesla is the unit of magnetic flux density.|The magnetic field strength was measured in gauss.|近义词：tesla (SI unit)|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The magnetic field is measured in gauss. = 磁场强度以高斯为单位测量。
This device produces a high gauss magnetic field. = 这设备产生一个高斯磁场。


一般过去时:
Scientists used gauss as a unit of measurement. = 科学家们过去使用高斯作为测量单位。
The experiment measured the gauss of the magnet. = 实验测量了磁铁的高斯值。


现在完成时:
Physicists have used gauss for many years. = 物理学家们已经使用高斯很多年了。
The research has shown inconsistent gauss readings. = 研究显示高斯读数不一致。


过去完成时:
They had already converted the gauss readings to tesla before the presentation. = 他们在演示之前已经将高斯读数转换为特斯拉了。
The data had been analyzed using gauss as the unit. = 数据是用高斯作为单位进行分析的。


将来时:
We will continue to use gauss in this project. = 我们将在本项目中继续使用高斯。
The new instrument will measure gauss more accurately. = 新仪器将更精确地测量高斯值。


虚拟语气:
If the experiment had used gauss, the results would have been different. = 如果实验使用了高斯，结果就会不同。
I wish the readings were expressed in gauss instead of tesla. = 我希望读数是用高斯而不是特斯拉表示的。


被动语态:
The magnetic field strength was measured in gauss. = 磁场强度以高斯为单位测量。
The data are being converted from gauss to tesla. = 数据正在从高斯转换为特斯拉。


疑问句:
What is the gauss reading? = 高斯读数是多少？
Is the magnetic field measured in gauss or tesla? = 磁场强度是用高斯还是特斯拉测量的？


否定句:
The magnetic field is not measured in gauss. = 磁场强度不是用高斯测量的。
The device did not produce a high gauss field. = 该设备没有产生高斯值高的磁场。



PHRASE->
gauss meter = 高斯计
gauss map = 高斯映射
lines of gauss = 高斯线
gauss theorem = 高斯定理
gauss rifle = 高斯步枪
