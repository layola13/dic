The word "handyfight" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we'll need to explore potential interpretations and offer suggestions based on possible intended meanings.

If "handyfight" was meant to be a combination of "handy" and "fight," it could be interpreted as a noun describing a fight involving skillful or convenient use of hands, potentially suggesting a quick, nimble, or clever fight.  It could also be a description of a fight that takes place in a convenient location or uses readily available objects as weapons.

Let's hypothesize and create a potential entry based on this interpretation:
