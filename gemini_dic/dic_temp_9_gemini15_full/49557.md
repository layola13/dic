词源:
The word "demeanour" comes from the Old French word "demener," meaning "to conduct oneself," "to behave," or "to manage."  It ultimately derives from the Latin word "deminari," which means "to diminish" or "to lessen."  The modern sense of "demeanour" shifted from the original meaning of "conduct" to focus on the outward manifestation of that conduct.
