词源:

The word "nutria" is derived from the Spanish word "nutria," which itself is derived from the Latin word "lutra," meaning "otter."  While both animals are semiaquatic, they are not closely related. The Spanish word likely came to be used for the South American rodent due to a superficial resemblance to otters.
