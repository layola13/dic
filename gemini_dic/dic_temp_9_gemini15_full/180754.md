词源:

* **regular:**  From Latin *regulāris*, from *rēgula* "rule, straight line," ultimately from *regere* "to rule, guide, direct."
* **-ity:**  A suffix forming nouns of state, condition, or quality (e.g.,  "regularity"  indicates the state or condition of being regular).

Therefore, "regularities" literally means "the state or condition of being governed by rules or exhibiting consistent patterns."
