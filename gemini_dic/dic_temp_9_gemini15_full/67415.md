The word "externes" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "externals," "external," or another similar-sounding word?

2. **It's a neologism or technical term:** It might be a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field (like a technical jargon). If this is the case, providing the context where you encountered the word would be helpful.

3. **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language.  Knowing the language's origin would help in its translation and analysis.


Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis in the requested format without more information. Please clarify the word's source or intended spelling.
