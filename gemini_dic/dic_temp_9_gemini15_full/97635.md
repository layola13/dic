词源:

The word "inheritabilities" is derived from the verb "inherit," ultimately tracing back to the Old English word "ierfe," meaning "heir, inheritance." The suffix "-able" indicates something capable of being done or possessed, and the further suffix "-ity" forms a noun signifying a state or quality.  Therefore, "inheritabilities" denotes the state or quality of being inheritable, referring to the capacity for traits or characteristics to be passed down genetically from one generation to the next.
