词源:
From Middle English *leavened, from Old English *lǣfned, past participle of lǣfan "to leave," related to Old English *hlǣf "loaf" (bread).  The connection lies in the traditional practice of leaving a portion of dough from one baking to serve as leaven for the next.  The modern sense derives from the use of this "left-over" dough, which contains active yeast, as a leavening agent.
