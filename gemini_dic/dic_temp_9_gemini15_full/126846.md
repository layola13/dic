naphthylamine:/næfˈθæləmiːn/| n. |萘胺|Aromatic amine derived from naphthalene.  It exists as two isomers, α-naphthylamine and β-naphthylamine, differing in the position of the amino group on the naphthalene ring. Both are colorless crystalline solids, but they darken upon exposure to air and light.  They are used in the production of dyes, but their use is restricted due to their carcinogenic properties.|例句：Exposure to α-naphthylamine has been linked to bladder cancer.|近义词：aminonaphthalene|反义词：N/A


USAGE->
