词源:
The word "conceitless" is formed by adding the negative prefix "less" to the noun "conceit," meaning excessive pride in oneself.  "Conceit" itself comes from the Old French word "conceit," meaning "thought, idea, opinion," and ultimately from the Latin "conceptus," the past participle of "concipere," meaning "to conceive."  The shift in meaning from "thought" to "excessive pride" occurred over time.
