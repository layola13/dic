词源:

The word "micrological" is derived from the combining form "micro-" (meaning "small") and the suffix "-logical" (relating to logic or a branch of study).  The "-logical" portion ultimately traces back to the Greek word "logos," meaning "word," "reason," or "study."  Therefore, "micrological" literally means "relating to the study of small things."


用法说明：

While "microbiological" is more commonly used, "micrological" is a valid, though less frequent, term, particularly in contexts where the focus is on the small scale of processes rather than specifically microorganisms.  It can be used interchangeably with "microbiological" in many situations but might sound slightly less precise.  The word typically appears in academic or scientific writing.
