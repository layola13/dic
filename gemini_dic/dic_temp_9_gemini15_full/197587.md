The word "shemshan" is not a word in standard English.  It does not appear in any major dictionaries or word lists.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (like a place name), a word from a different language, or a neologism (newly coined word).  To provide the requested analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (book, website, conversation, etc.)
* **What is the surrounding text or conversation?** This will help determine the intended meaning and potential origin.

Without this information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.
