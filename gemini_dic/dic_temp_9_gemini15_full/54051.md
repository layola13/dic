词源：

The word "disdainful" is derived from the Old French word "desdaigner," which means "to disdain."  This, in turn, has roots in the Latin word "dis-" (meaning "away" or "apart") and "dedignare" (meaning "to deem unworthy").  Therefore, the core meaning has always been a feeling of unworthiness or lack of respect directed towards something or someone.
