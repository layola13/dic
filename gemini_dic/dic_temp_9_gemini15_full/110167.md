The word "liement" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis according to the requested format.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a very rare or archaic word: If this is the case, finding information would require specialized dictionaries or linguistic resources.
* It's a neologism or word from a specific field:  If it's a newly coined word or jargon from a particular area (e.g., technical, scientific), providing context would help.

Please provide more information or clarify the spelling if you'd like assistance.
