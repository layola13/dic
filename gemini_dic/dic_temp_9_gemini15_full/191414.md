The word "{schene}" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, a word used within a specific community or subculture, or a slang term not yet widely recognized.
* **It's from another language:** It could be a word from a different language that hasn't been adopted into English.

Please provide the correct spelling or more context so I can assist you.
