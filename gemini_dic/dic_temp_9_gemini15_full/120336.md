词源:
The word "minimalist" is derived from the noun "minimalism," which itself comes from the adjective "minimal."  "Minimal" ultimately traces back to the Latin word "minimus," meaning "the smallest."  Therefore, "minimalist" refers to something characterized by its minimum or essential elements, avoiding excess or ornamentation.
