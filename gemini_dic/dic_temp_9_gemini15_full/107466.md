The word "lamth" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* **It's a neologism:** It could be a newly coined word, slang, or a term specific to a particular field or community.  If this is the case, please provide more context about where you encountered it.
* **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language, in which case providing that language would be helpful.


Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  Please clarify the word or provide more context.
