词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation, but not a complete identity.

* **forgetful**: From "forget" + "-ful," a suffix indicating full of or characterized by.  "Forget" traces back to Old English *forgietan*, combining *for-*,  (from *fra-*, meaning "from") and *gietan*, meaning "to get, obtain, seize."
