词源:

The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to a too great extent) and "sparingly" (meaning in a frugal or economical manner).  "Sparingly" itself derives from "spare" (meaning to refrain from using or spending something).  The root of "spare" traces back to Old English words related to saving or preserving.
