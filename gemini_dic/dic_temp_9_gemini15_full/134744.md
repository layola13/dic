nonmeditativenesses:/ˌnɒnˌmedɪˈteɪtɪvnəsɪz/| n. |非冥想状态；缺乏冥想性的事物|The word "nonmeditativenesses" is a rare and somewhat awkward plural noun.  It refers to multiple instances or examples of a lack of meditative qualities or states.  It's formed by adding "-nesses" (a pluralizing suffix often used with abstract nouns ending in "-ness") to "nonmeditativeness," which itself combines the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with "meditativeness" (the state of being meditative).  The word is not commonly used in everyday language and feels overly verbose.  A simpler alternative would often be preferable.|例句：His constant anxieties and distractions contributed to his numerous nonmeditativenesses during the retreat.  他的持续焦虑和分心导致他在静修期间多次无法进入冥想状态。  The teacher noted several nonmeditativenesses among the students during the guided meditation. 教师在引导冥想期间注意到学生中有几例缺乏冥想状态的情况。|近义词：lacks of mindfulness, absences of meditation, unmeditative states (more common and natural alternatives)|反义词：meditativenesses, moments of mindfulness, meditative states|名词
