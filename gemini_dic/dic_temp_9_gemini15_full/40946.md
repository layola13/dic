The word "coopee" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word.
* **It's a slang term or regional dialect word:** Its meaning would be highly context-dependent and require more information about where you encountered it.
* **It's a proper noun (name):**  If it's a person's name or a place name, providing more context would be helpful.
* **It's a newly coined word:**  If it's a very recent invention, it wouldn't yet be in dictionaries.
