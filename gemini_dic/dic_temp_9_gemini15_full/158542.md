/ˈplɛzɪmɔːrfɪzəm/| n. |假同形现象，同形异义词| Plesimorphism refers to the phenomenon in linguistics where two or more words have the same form (spelling and pronunciation) but different origins and meanings.  This is distinct from homonymy, where words share the same form due to historical accident or coincidence. Plesimorphism highlights the separate etymological paths that led to the same form.  The words are not related historically. | Example:  The English word "bank" (river bank) and "bank" (financial institution) are plesiomorphs. They share the same spelling and pronunciation, but derive from different sources.  |近义词：homonymy (although technically distinct)|反义词：无|名词
