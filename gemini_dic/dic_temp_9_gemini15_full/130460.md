词源:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of".
* **absorb**: From Latin *absorbere*, meaning "to swallow up".  This verb implies taking in something completely, often liquids or gases.
* **-tive**: A suffix forming adjectives from verbs, indicating a capacity or tendency.

Therefore, "nonabsorptive" literally means "not having the capacity to absorb."
