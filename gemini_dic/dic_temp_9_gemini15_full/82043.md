词源:
The word "grisly" ultimately derives from the Old Norse word "grisligr," meaning "terrible," "fearsome," or "horrible."  The word entered Middle English via Old Norse influence.  Over time, the meaning has evolved to emphasize the horror and gruesome aspects of something, often relating to death or violence.
