The word "millian" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  It's possible it's:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word, such as "million," "milion," or a proper noun incorporating "milli-" as a prefix.
* **A neologism:** A newly coined word not yet widely accepted.
* **A technical term:**  Specific to a particular field or area of study.
* **A proper noun:** A name or place.


If you could provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
