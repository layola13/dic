词源:
The word "desperado" is derived from the Spanish word "desperado," which itself comes from the verb "desesperar," meaning "to despair" or "to lose hope." The suffix "-ado" is a common Spanish suffix used to form nouns from verbs, often denoting a person or thing characterized by the action of the verb.  Therefore, a "desperado" literally means someone who is "despaired" or "driven to desperation."  The word entered English from Spanish, reflecting the historical context of outlaws and bandits in the American Southwest.
