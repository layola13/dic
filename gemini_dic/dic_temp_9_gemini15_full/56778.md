The word "dopily" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very niche dialect or slang.


If you intended a different word, please provide the correct spelling.  If "dopily" was intended as a playful or invented word, please provide context so I can offer a possible interpretation.
