When illuminated with a laser, the interference pattern diffracts light to recreate a three-dimensional image of the original object.  The image appears to have depth and can be viewed from different angles.|The museum displayed a fascinating hologram of a dinosaur.|近义词：3D image, holographic image |反义词：photograph (2D image)
