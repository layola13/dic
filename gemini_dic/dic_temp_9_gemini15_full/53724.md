discoblastic: /ˌdɪskəʊˈblæstɪk/ | adj. | 盘状胚盘的；具有盘状胚盘的 | Relating to or characterized by a discoid blastodisc (a flattened, disc-shaped mass of cells in the early embryo of certain animals, such as birds and reptiles).  | Example:  The avian embryo exhibits a discoblastic pattern of development.  鸟类胚胎表现出盘状胚盘的发育模式。 | 近义词: discoidal (in this context) | 反义词:  N/A (no direct antonym, but could be contrasted with terms describing other types of blastodisc)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The avian embryo exhibits a discoblastic pattern of development. = 鸟类胚胎表现出盘状胚盘的发育模式。

一般过去时:
Researchers observed a discoblastic blastodisc in the early embryo. = 研究人员在早期胚胎中观察到一个盘状胚盘。
The study documented the formation of a discoblastic embryo. = 这项研究记录了盘状胚胎的形成。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several key genes involved in discoblastic development. = 科学家们已经确定了几个参与盘状胚盘发育的关键基因。
Studies have shown that environmental factors can influence discoblastic cleavage. = 研究表明，环境因素会影响盘状卵裂。


过去完成时:
Before fertilization, the egg already contained the precursor cells for the discoblastic blastoderm. = 受精前，卵子已经包含了盘状胚层的前体细胞。
The researchers had hypothesized that the mutation would affect discoblastic development. = 研究人员曾假设该突变会影响盘状胚盘的发育。


将来时:
Further research will investigate the mechanisms underlying discoblastic development. = 今后的研究将调查盘状胚盘发育的潜在机制。

被动语态:
The discoblastic cleavage pattern was observed in several species. = 在几个物种中都观察到了盘状卵裂模式。
The development of the discoblastic blastodisc is influenced by numerous factors. = 盘状胚盘的发育受到许多因素的影响。


疑问句:
Is this species characterized by discoblastic development? = 这个物种的特点是盘状胚盘发育吗？
What are the key differences between discoblastic and holoblastic cleavage? = 盘状卵裂和全裂卵裂的主要区别是什么？


否定句:
