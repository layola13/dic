词源:  The word "extravagantly" derives from the word "extravagant," which itself comes from the Late Latin word *extravagans*, meaning "wandering beyond."  The prefix "extra-" means "beyond" or "outside," and the root "-vagans" is related to the Latin verb *vagari*, meaning "to wander" or "to roam."  The original sense thus implied going beyond the bounds of reason or moderation, which evolved into the current meaning of excessive spending.
