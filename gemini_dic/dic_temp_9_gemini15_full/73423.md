The word "forelie" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific dialect or jargon, or a proper noun.  If you could provide more context on where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
