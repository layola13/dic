词源:

The word "denizens" ultimately derives from the Old French word "deigne," meaning "worthy" or "dignified."  This evolved into the Middle English word "deyn," which meant "dignified person" or "inhabitant." The modern spelling and meaning emerged over time, associating the word with the inhabitants of a particular place or environment, often with a sense of belonging or established presence.
