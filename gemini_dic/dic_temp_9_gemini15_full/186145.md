词源:
The word "rhapsodize" comes from the Greek word "rhapsōidós," meaning "stitcher of songs" or "one who sings epics."  In ancient Greece, rhapsodes were professional performers who recited epic poems, often improvising and embellishing the text with passionate delivery.  The word's evolution reflects this origin, emphasizing the passionate and often improvisational nature of the expression.
