The word "hoim" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or looking word?
* **A word from another language:**  If it's from a different language, please specify the language so I can attempt a translation and explanation.
* **A neologism or slang:**  It could be a newly coined word or slang term not yet widely recognized.  More context is needed.

Please provide more information or the correct spelling so I can assist you.
