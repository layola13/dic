Etymology:

The word "pleurobranchia" is derived from the Greek words:

* **pleuron (πλευρόν):** meaning "rib," "side," or "flank"
* **branchia (βραγχία):** meaning "gills"

Therefore, "pleurobranchia" literally means "side gills," referring to the characteristic gill placement on the side of these sea slugs.
