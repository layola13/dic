词源:
The word "charismatic" originates from the Greek word "khárisma" (χάρισμα), meaning "gift," "grace," or "divine favor."  This term was originally associated with religious leaders and figures believed to be divinely appointed or blessed with exceptional qualities.  Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass anyone possessing a compelling personality and ability to inspire others.  The suffix "-atic" was added to create the adjective "charismatic."
