词源:  The word "disclaimer" is derived from the verb "disclaim," which is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "away") and the verb "claim."  "Claim" originally meant "to call, shout, or cry out," and later evolved to mean "to assert a right to something." Thus, "disclaim" means to deny or reject a claim.  The suffix "-er" transforms the verb into a noun, signifying the act or statement of disclaiming.
