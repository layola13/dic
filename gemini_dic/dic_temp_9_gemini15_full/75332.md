The word "frosteds" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a non-standard pluralization.  A likely intended word is "frostings," the plural of "frosting."  Therefore, I will analyze "frosting" instead.


frosting: /ˈfrɒstɪŋ/ | n. | 糖霜；霜状物 | A sweet, creamy mixture used to decorate or cover cakes, cookies, and other baked goods.  It can be made with various ingredients, including butter, sugar, and flavorings. |  例句：She decorated the cake with delicious chocolate frosting. 她用美味的巧克力糖霜装饰了蛋糕。  The windows were frosted with ice. 窗户上结了一层霜。 | 近义词：icing, glaze | 反义词:  bare, uncovered
