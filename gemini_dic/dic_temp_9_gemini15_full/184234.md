词源:
The word "resolution" comes from the Old French word "resolucion," which in turn derives from the Latin word "resolutionem," the noun of action from the verb "resolvere," meaning "to loosen, untie, solve, melt."  The sense of "firm decision" evolved from the idea of "solving" a problem of indecision.  The various meanings of the word are all connected to the idea of resolving something, whether a problem, a dispute, an image, or a state of uncertainty.
