semi-cell:/ˈsemiˌsɛl/| n. |半电池，半电池单元|A semi-cell is a single electrode immersed in an electrolyte solution.  It is half of a complete electrochemical cell, and cannot function on its own to produce a potential difference.  It needs to be coupled with another semi-cell to form a complete cell. |例句：The hydrogen electrode is a common type of semi-cell used in electrochemistry. 氢电极是在电化学中常用的一种半电池。

The standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) is a commonly used reference semi-cell. 标准氢电极 (SHE) 是一个常用的参考半电池。|近义词：half-cell |反义词：full cell, complete cell
