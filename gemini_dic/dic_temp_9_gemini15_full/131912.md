词源:

* **contiguous:**  (adj.) touching or next to; adjacent.  From Latin *contingere* "to touch," from *con-* "together" + *tangere* "to touch."

* **non-:** (prefix)  not; opposite of.

* **-ness:** (suffix)  the state or quality of being.

Therefore, "noncontiguousnesses" literally means "the states or qualities of not being adjacent or connected."
