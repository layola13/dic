词源:
The word "jockey" ultimately derives from the Middle Dutch word *joc, meaning "boy" or "lad".  This term evolved through various stages in Middle English, becoming associated with young stable boys and then specifically horse riders.  The modern meaning of "horse race rider" developed in the 17th century.
