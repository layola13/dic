The word "preeffects" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a term specific to a particular field or context.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis according to your requested format.  To provide the analysis, I need a valid English word.
