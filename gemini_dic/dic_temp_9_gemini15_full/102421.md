词源:

The word "jackanapes" is believed to have originated in the 16th century. Its etymology is uncertain, but the most widely accepted theory suggests it is a blend of "jack" (a common diminutive or term of familiarity) and "anapes," which is believed to be a corruption of the French word "âne" (meaning "donkey"). This suggests an image of a small, foolish, and stubborn person, similar to a donkey.  Another less accepted theory connects "anapes" to "ape," referring to imitative behavior.
