词源:

The word "proud" comes from the Old English word "prūde," meaning "proud, haughty, arrogant."  This word, in turn, has roots in Proto-Germanic and ultimately connects to a sense of "raising oneself," suggesting an elevated position or status.  The modern sense of pride, while retaining a hint of the older connotations of arrogance, has largely evolved to encompass feelings of justifiable self-respect and satisfaction.
