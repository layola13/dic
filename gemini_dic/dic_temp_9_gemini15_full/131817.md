词源:

The word "nonconsequentially" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), the word "consequential" (meaning "following as a result or consequence"), and the adverbial suffix "-ly".  "Consequential" itself comes from the Latin "consequens," the present participle of "consequi" (to follow, obtain).


用法说明：

"Nonconsequentially" is an adverb used to describe something that is not a logical consequence or result of something else. It often implies irrelevance or insignificance.  It suggests a lack of connection between the described action or statement and its context.  The action or statement might be seemingly random, tangential, or digressive.
