词源:
The word "invitingly" derives from the adjective "inviting," which itself comes from the verb "invite."  The suffix "-ingly" transforms the adjective into an adverb, modifying verbs and describing how an action is performed.  The root is related to the Latin word "invitare," meaning "to call in," "to invite."
