词源:
The word "politician" comes from the Middle English word "politicyen," which itself is derived from the Old French word "politicien."  The ultimate origin lies in the Greek word "politikos," meaning "of or relating to citizens," "civic," or "political."  This Greek word is related to "polis," meaning "city-state."  Thus, the word's history reflects the close connection between governance and the citizenry of a city or state.
