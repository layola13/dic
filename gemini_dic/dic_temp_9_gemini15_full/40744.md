词源:
The word "conveyor" comes from the verb "convey," meaning "to transport" or "to communicate."  The suffix "-or" indicates an agent or instrument.  The root of "convey" can be traced back to the Old French word "convoier," which itself derives from the Latin "convehere," meaning "to carry together."
