keyframes:/ˈkiːfreɪmz/ | n. |关键帧|A keyframe is a specific point in time within an animation sequence.  It defines the visual state of an element at that particular point.  By defining keyframes at different points, you can create smooth transitions between those states, resulting in the animation effect.  Keyframes are commonly used in CSS animations and JavaScript animation libraries.|Example:  In CSS animations, you define keyframes using the `@keyframes` rule, specifying the percentage of the animation's duration and the styles to apply at that point. This allows you to create complex animations by specifying the style at different stages.  For instance, you could define a keyframe at 0% to set the initial state, 50% for a midpoint state, and 100% for the final state.

USAGE->
(Keyframes are primarily used in programming contexts, so tense conjugation is not directly applicable in the same way as with verbs.  The examples below illustrate how keyframes are *defined* and *used* in different scenarios.)

Defining Keyframes:
Example 1 (CSS):
@keyframes myAnimation {
  0% { transform: scale(1); }
  100% { transform: scale(2); }
}

This defines keyframes for an animation named "myAnimation."  At 0% (the start), the element is at its normal scale. At 100% (the end), it's scaled to twice its size.  = 定义了一个名为“myAnimation”的动画的关键帧。在0%（开始时），元素处于正常比例。在100%（结束时），它的大小是原来的两倍。


Example 2 (Conceptual):
An animation sequence might have keyframes at 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% to define different poses or positions of a character or object.  = 动画序列可能在 0%、25%、50%、75% 和 100% 处设置关键帧，以定义角色或物体的不同姿势或位置。


Using Keyframes in an animation:
Example 3 (CSS):
.element {
  animation: myAnimation 2s ease; /* Applies the animation defined above */
}

This applies the `myAnimation` to the element with a duration of 2 seconds and an "ease" timing function. = 这将 `myAnimation` 应用于该元素，持续时间为 2 秒，并使用“ease”计时函数。


Example 4 (JavaScript - Conceptual):
In JavaScript animation libraries, you would typically define an array of keyframes, each representing a state at a specific time. The library would then interpolate between these keyframes to create the animation.  = 在 JavaScript 动画库中，您通常会定义一个关键帧数组，每个关键帧代表特定时间的状态。然后，库将在这些关键帧之间进行插值以创建动画。
