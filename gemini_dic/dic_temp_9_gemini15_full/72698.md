词源:
The word "focalizes" is derived from the word "focus," which comes from the Latin word "focus" meaning "hearth" or "fireplace."  The figurative extension to "center of attention" or "point of concentration" developed over time.  The "-izes" ending indicates the third-person singular present tense of a verb.
