词源:
The word "optometer" is a combination of "opto-" (relating to vision or optics) and "-meter" (a measuring instrument).  "Opto-" derives from the Greek word "optos," meaning "seen" or "visible," while "-meter" comes from the Greek word "metron," meaning "measure."  Therefore, the word literally means "a vision measuring instrument."
