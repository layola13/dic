词源:
The word "lousy" ultimately derives from the Old English word "lūs," meaning "louse" (a small insect that infests the hair and body of humans and animals).  The association with something unpleasant likely stems from the unpleasantness of being infested with lice.  The shift from "louse" to "lousy" involved a semantic broadening, where the adjective came to mean generally unpleasant or of poor quality.
