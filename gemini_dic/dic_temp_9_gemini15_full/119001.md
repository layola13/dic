methionine:/mɛˈθaɪənɪn/ | n. | 甲硫氨酸 | Methionine is an essential amino acid, meaning the body cannot produce it and it must be obtained through diet. It plays a crucial role in protein synthesis and various metabolic processes.  | Example:  A diet deficient in methionine can lead to health problems.  甲硫氨酸缺乏的饮食会导致健康问题。 |近义词:  (None truly synonymous, as it's a specific amino acid) |反义词: (None)
