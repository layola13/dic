词源:
The word "perceptiblenesses" is derived from the adjective "perceptible," which comes from the Latin "percipere," meaning "to perceive," "to seize," or "to grasp."  The suffix "-ible" indicates capability or possibility, and the suffix "-ness" creates a noun signifying a state or quality.  The final "-es" is the plural marker for nouns.
