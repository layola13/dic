The word "mallecho" is not an English word.  It appears to be a word from Spanish.  Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis following the requested format for English words.  To provide a similar analysis for the Spanish word "malhecho," I need to adjust the format slightly, since the grammatical categories will differ.

**malhecho:** /malˈtʃe.tʃo/ | adj. | 坏的，做坏的，拙劣的 | ill-made, badly done, poorly executed; also, misdeed, wrongdoing (depending on context) |


**English Translation & Explanation:**

The Spanish word "malhecho" literally translates to "badly done" or "ill-made." It's an adjective that describes something poorly constructed, executed, or performed.  It can also refer to a misdeed or wrongdoing, depending on the context.  The word is formed by combining "mal" (bad) and "hecho" (done, made).


**Examples:**

* Un trabajo malhecho:  A badly done job.
* Una casa malhecha: A poorly built house.
* Fue un malhecho robar el dinero: Stealing the money was a wrongdoing.


**Synonyms (Spanish):**

* Mal hecho (literally "badly done"): This is the most direct equivalent.
* Deficiente: Deficient, inadequate.
* Defectuoso: Defective, flawed.
* Mal ejecutado: Poorly executed.
* Delito (for the "wrongdoing" sense): Crime, offense.


**Antonyms (Spanish):**

* Bien hecho (literally "well done"):  Well-made, well-executed.
* Perfecto: Perfect.
* Excelente: Excellent.
* Impecable: Impeccable.
* Correcto: Correct.


**Grammatical Considerations (Spanish):**

Since "malhecho" is an adjective, it agrees in gender and number with the noun it modifies.

* Masculine singular: malhecho
* Feminine singular: malhecha
* Masculine plural: malhechos
* Feminine plural: malhechas


**Note:**  There is no direct equivalent to the English verb tense system in this single word. The tense would be determined by the verb in the sentence using "malhecho" as an adjective.  For example, "El trabajo estaba malhecho" (The work *was* badly done).


I hope this adapted analysis is helpful. If you have a different Spanish word or an English word in mind, please let me know.
