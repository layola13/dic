词源:
The word "ensure" comes from the Old French word "enseurer," meaning "to make sure" or "to guarantee."  This, in turn, derives from the prefix "en-" (meaning "in" or "into") and the verb "seurer," related to the Latin word "securus," meaning "secure" or "safe."  The evolution reflects the sense of bringing something into a state of security or certainty.
