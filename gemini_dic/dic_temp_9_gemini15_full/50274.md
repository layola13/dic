dephlegmator: /ˌdiːˈflɛɡmeɪtər/ | n. |除湿器，去痰器 | A device used to remove phlegm or other condensable vapors from a gas or vapor stream.  It's commonly used in distillation processes to separate liquids with different boiling points. | Example: The dephlegmator in the distillation column efficiently separated the ethanol from the water.  除湿器在蒸馏塔中有效地将乙醇与水分离。|近义词：condenser, rectifier |反义词：None specifically, but devices that *add* moisture could be considered antonyms in a functional sense.

词源:  The word "dephlegmator" is derived from the words "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to deprive of") and "phlegm," referring to a viscous fluid secreted in the respiratory tract.  Historically, the term referred to devices that removed phlegm-like substances from liquids, but its modern usage extends to any device that separates condensable vapors.
