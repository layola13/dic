词源:
The word "readymade" is a compound word formed from "ready" and "made."  "Ready" means prepared or in a state of readiness, while "made" indicates something that has been manufactured or created.  The combination signifies something that is already manufactured and available for immediate use.  Its usage became widespread in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the rise of mass production.
