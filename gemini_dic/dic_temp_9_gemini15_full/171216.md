词源:
The word "psychosomatically" is derived from the combination of "psycho-" (from Greek *psyche*, meaning "mind, soul, spirit") and "somatic" (from Greek *sōma*, meaning "body").  The "-ically" suffix indicates an adverbial form.  Therefore, the word literally means "in a way relating to the mind and body."
