词源:
The word "pocket" comes from the Old French word "poque," meaning "small bag." The word "money" is derived from the Old French word "moneie," ultimately from the Latin word "moneta," referring to coins minted at the temple of Juno Moneta in Rome.  Therefore, "pocket money" literally means money kept in one's pocket, implying a small, personal amount of money.
