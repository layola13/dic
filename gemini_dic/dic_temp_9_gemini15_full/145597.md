overcondensing: /ˌoʊvər kənˈdensɪŋ/ | v. | 过度冷凝 | The process of condensing beyond the normal or expected level, often resulting in undesirable effects.  It implies an excessive amount of condensation. | Example: Overcondensing in the distillation process led to a blockage in the condenser.  过度冷凝的蒸馏过程导致冷凝器堵塞。 | 近义词: excessive condensation, supercondensation | 反义词: insufficient condensation, undercondensation
