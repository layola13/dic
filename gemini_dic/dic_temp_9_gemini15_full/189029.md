词源:
The word "sabbatical" ultimately derives from the Hebrew word "shabbat" (שַׁבָּת), meaning "sabbath," the seventh day of the week observed as a day of rest.  The connection lies in the concept of rest and renewal associated with both the Sabbath and a sabbatical leave.  The word entered English through Latin and eventually evolved to its current form.
