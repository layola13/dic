hypotaxises: /ˌhaɪpəˈtæksɪsiːz/ | n. | 并列从句；下位句 | The grammatical arrangement of clauses in a sentence where one clause is subordinate to another.  This is in contrast to parataxis, where clauses are of equal grammatical rank. Hypotaxis involves the use of subordinating conjunctions and relative pronouns to link clauses, creating a hierarchical structure. | Example:  "Although it was raining, we went for a walk." (The clause "Although it was raining" is subordinate to the main clause "we went for a walk.") | 近义词: subordination, subordination clause | 反义词: parataxis


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in linguistic analysis and grammatical discussions.  It doesn't have common usage in everyday conversation. Therefore, providing example sentences across various tenses and moods would be artificial and misleading.  The primary usage is descriptive, not prescriptive.  It describes a grammatical structure rather than being a verb that can be conjugated.

PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "hypotaxises".  The term itself is used within the field of linguistics to describe a complex grammatical structure.
