词源:
The word "joulemeter" is a compound word.  "Joule" is named after James Prescott Joule, a British physicist who established the relationship between heat and mechanical work, and the SI unit of energy (the joule) is named in his honor.  "-meter" is a suffix indicating a measuring instrument. Therefore, a joulemeter is an instrument for measuring energy in joules.
