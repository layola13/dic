The word "gole" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* It's a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* It's a proper noun (a name, place, etc.).
* It's a word from a specific dialect or jargon not widely known.
* It's a newly coined word.
