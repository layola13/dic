词源:
The word "palmidactyles" is derived from two Greek words:

* **palma:** meaning "palm" or "hand"
* **dactylos:** meaning "finger" or "toe"

Therefore, "palmidactyles" literally translates to "palm-toed" or "hand-toed," referring to the webbed or palmate structure of their digits.

用法说明:
This term is primarily used in zoology and comparative anatomy to describe animals with webbed feet or hands.  It's less common in everyday conversation.  The plural form is used to refer to multiple species or individuals exhibiting this characteristic.  It is a relatively specialized term.
