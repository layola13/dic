The word "miss-tarts" does not appear to be a valid English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word not yet recognized in standard dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about the intended meaning.
