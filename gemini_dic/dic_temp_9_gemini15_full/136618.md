词源:

The word is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the present participle "satirizing" (derived from the verb "satirize").  "Satirize" itself comes from the noun "satire," which has roots in the Latin word "satura," meaning "a medley," or "a mixture."  The original sense of "satura" evolved to refer to a literary genre combining various elements to criticize or ridicule.
