词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "compromising," which itself derives from the verb "compromise," meaning "to settle a dispute by mutual concession."  Therefore, "noncompromising" literally means "not willing to compromise."  The ultimate roots lie in the Latin "compromittere," meaning "to promise together," reflecting the act of mutual agreement in a compromise.
