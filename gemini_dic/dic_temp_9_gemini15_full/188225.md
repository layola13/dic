The word "rown" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it with phonetic transcription, grammatical function, or meaning.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis following the example format.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a regional dialect word, or a neologism (newly coined word).  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
