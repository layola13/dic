chemoreceptors:/ˌkiːmoʊrɪˈsɛptərz/| n. |化学感受器|Specialized sensory nerve endings or cells that respond to chemical stimuli.  They detect changes in the chemical composition of their surroundings, such as the presence of specific molecules or changes in pH. This information is then transmitted to the nervous system.  Examples include taste receptors on the tongue and olfactory receptors in the nose. |例句：The chemoreceptors in your nose detect the smell of the roses. 你鼻子里的化学感受器能够检测到玫瑰花的香味。

例句：Our bodies use chemoreceptors to monitor blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels. 我们的身体利用化学感受器来监测血液中的氧气和二氧化碳水平。


近义词：sensory receptors, chemical sensors|反义词：None directly applicable.  The antonym would be a receptor sensitive to a different type of stimuli (e.g., mechanoreceptor, photoreceptor).

词源:  From "chemo-" (chemical) + "receptor" (receiver, detector).  The prefix "chemo-" comes from the Greek word "khēmeia" (chemistry). "Receptor" has Latin roots.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Chemoreceptors detect changes in chemical concentrations. = 化学感受器检测化学浓度的变化。

疑问句:
What types of chemoreceptors are found in the body? = 人体中有哪些类型的化学感受器？
How do chemoreceptors transmit signals to the brain? = 化学感受器如何将信号传递给大脑？


否定句:
The chemoreceptors did not respond to the weak stimulus. = 化学感受器没有对微弱的刺激做出反应。
The patient's chemoreceptors were not functioning properly. = 患者的化学感受器功能不正常。


PHRASE->
