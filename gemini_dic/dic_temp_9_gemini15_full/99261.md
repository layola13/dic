intercomprehensibility: /ˌɪntərˌkɑːmpriˌhɛnsəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 相互理解性，互通性 | The degree to which different varieties of a language or different languages are mutually understandable.  It refers to the ability of speakers of different dialects or languages to understand each other.  The level of intercomprehensibility can vary greatly depending on factors such as geographical proximity, historical relationships, and the extent of language contact. | Example:  The high degree of intercomprehensibility between Norwegian and Danish allows speakers of both languages to communicate relatively easily.  The low intercomprehensibility between English and Mandarin requires significant effort from both speakers. | 近义词: mutual intelligibility, understandability | 反义词:  unintelligibility, incomprehensibility |  名词
