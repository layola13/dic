overdispersion:/ˌoʊvərˌdɪsˈpɜːrʒən/| n. |过度离散；超分散|The phenomenon where the variance of a statistical distribution is greater than its mean, often observed in count data where the observed variability exceeds that expected under a standard model like the Poisson distribution.  This can indicate that the data are not independent or that the model is misspecified.  For example, in a study of the number of accidents per day, overdispersion might suggest that some days are inherently more risky than others, leading to clustered events.|The data showed significant overdispersion, suggesting a need for a more complex model.  这些数据显示出明显的过度离散，表明需要一个更复杂的模型。|underdispersion|None (antonym is a concept, not a word)|
