词源:  From charlatan + -ry.  "Charlatan" itself originates from the Italian word "ciarlatano," which referred to a street vendor who would loudly advertise their wares, often exaggerating or fabricating their qualities.  This evolved into the modern meaning of a person who falsely claims to have a special knowledge or skill, especially in medicine or science.
