词源:
interruption comes from the verb "interrupt," which is from the Latin word "interruptus," the past participle of "interrumpere."  "Inter" means "between" or "among," and "rumpere" means "to break."  Therefore, "interrupt" literally means "to break between" or "to break into." The suffix "-ion" forms a noun.
