词源:
The word "seersucker" is believed to derive from the Persian words "shir o shakar," meaning "milk and sugar,"  referencing the appearance of the fabric.  Another theory suggests it comes from the Hindi word "shirshakar," meaning "head and sugar." Both relate to the fabric's appearance and texture.  The word entered English in the 19th century.
