词源:

The word is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the adjective "accessible" (meaning "able to be reached or approached"), and the suffix "-ness" (forming a noun of state or quality), and finally the plural suffix "-es".  "Accessible" itself derives from the Latin "accessibilis," from "accedere" (to approach).


用法说明:


This word is relatively uncommon in everyday conversation. It's primarily used in formal writing or specialized contexts where multiple aspects of inaccessibility need to be emphasized.  The singular form, "inaccessibility," is more frequently used.
