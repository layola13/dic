词源:

Derived from "potential," which originates from the Latin word "potentia," meaning "power," "strength," or "ability."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun form, signifying the state or quality of being potential.


用法说明：

Potentialness is less common than "potential" in everyday usage.  "Potential" is usually sufficient to convey the meaning.  Potentialness is often used in more formal or academic contexts to emphasize the inherent capability or the state of having potential.  It's often used when discussing abstract concepts or possibilities.  It is generally used as a noun, and therefore does not have verb, adjective, or adverb forms.
