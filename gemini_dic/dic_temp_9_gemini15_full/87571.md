heterophony: /ˌhɛtəˈrɒfəni/ | /ˌhɛtərˈɒfəni/ | n. | 异音，复音 | Heterophony is a musical texture in which two or more parts sound simultaneously, but with slight variations in melody or rhythm.  It differs from polyphony, where independent melodic lines are clearly defined.  It often features a main melody with variations or improvisations on it. | Example:  In some traditional folk music, a lead singer might be accompanied by other singers who harmonize imperfectly, creating a heterophonic texture.  这在一些传统民歌中很常见，主唱可能伴随着其他歌手略有不完美的和声，从而创造出异音的音响效果。 | 近义词: polyphony (but with emphasis on the variations), improvisation | 反义词: monophony
