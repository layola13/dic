melanosperm: /ˌmɛlənoʊˈspɜːrm/ | n. |黑色精子；黑色精细胞 |  The term "melanosperm" refers to sperm cells that contain melanin, a pigment responsible for skin and hair color.  The presence of melanin in sperm is not fully understood and is an area of ongoing research. While melanin's role in protecting skin from UV radiation is well known, its function in sperm is unclear. Some hypotheses suggest it may play a role in protecting sperm DNA from oxidative stress or in sperm motility. However, further research is needed to confirm these hypotheses.  | Example:  The research paper investigated the presence and potential function of melanosperm in various animal species. = 这篇研究论文调查了不同动物物种中黑色精子的存在及其潜在功能。  |近义词: pigmented sperm (色素精子) |反义词:  None specifically, but terms describing sperm lacking melanin could be used in contrast. |
