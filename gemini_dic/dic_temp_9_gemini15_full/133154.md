/nʌnˈɛθɪkəlˌnɛsɪz/ | n. | 不道德的行为；非伦理行为 |  The word "nonethicalnesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a self-made word, combining "non-" (meaning "not") with "ethicalness" (itself not a common word, but implying "the state of being ethical").  Therefore, a precise definition and usage examples are difficult to provide.  The intended meaning is likely to refer to instances of unethical behavior or the absence of ethical behavior. However, the word is awkward and should be avoided in favor of clearer alternatives. |  The company's actions were a series of nonethicalnesses. (This sentence uses the word, but it is grammatically awkward and should be rephrased.) | unethical acts, immoral deeds, breaches of ethics, improprieties, wrongdoings | ethical acts, moral behavior, virtuous actions | 名词
