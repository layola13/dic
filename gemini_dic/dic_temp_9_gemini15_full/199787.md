The word "siserary" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it in major resources like Merriam-Webster, Oxford English Dictionary, or Cambridge Dictionary.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information according to the requested format.  It may be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a very specialized or obscure field, or a fictional word.
