词源:

The word derives from the Late Latin *praecarius, meaning "obtained by entreaty,"  ultimately from Latin *praecari, "to beg, entreat."  The sense shifted to "dependent on chance" and then to "unstable" or "risky."  The suffix "-ness" adds the noun quality, indicating the state or condition of being precarious.  The plural "-es" signifies multiple instances of such a state.
