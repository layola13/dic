The word "precounsels" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word), a misspelling, or a word from a very specialized or archaic context.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need more context where you encountered this word.  For example:

* **Source:** Where did you see or hear this word? (Book, article, conversation, etc.)
* **Sentence:** Can you provide the sentence where this word appears?  This will help determine the intended meaning and perhaps reveal the intended word.

Without this context, I cannot provide the requested information on pronunciation, word class, translation, usage, synonyms, antonyms, etc.
