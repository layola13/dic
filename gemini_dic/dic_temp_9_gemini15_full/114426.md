词源:
The term "make-to-order" is a relatively modern compound term, arising from the development of more efficient and flexible manufacturing processes in the 20th century.  It combines the verb "make" (meaning to produce or manufacture) with the prepositional phrase "to order," indicating that the production is initiated only upon receipt of a customer order.  There isn't a single historical etymology as it's a descriptive phrase rather than a word with a distinct origin.
