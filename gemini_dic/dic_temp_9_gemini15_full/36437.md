colatitude:/ˈkoʊlæṭɪˌtuːd/|/ˈkəʊlæṭɪˌtjuːd/| n. |余纬，余纬度|The angular distance north or south of the equator, measured along a meridian, to a point's complement of latitude.  It is calculated by subtracting the latitude from 90 degrees. For example, a location with a latitude of 40 degrees North has a colatitude of 50 degrees. Colatitude is useful in various calculations in geography, astronomy, and navigation.  |Example: The colatitude of London is approximately 50 degrees.|近义词: complementary latitude|反义词: latitude

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The colatitude of this city is 45 degrees. = 这个城市的余纬是45度。
What is the colatitude of the North Pole? = 北极的余纬是多少？


一般过去时:
The colatitude of that location was calculated yesterday. = 昨天计算了那个地点的余纬。
We found the colatitude using a celestial navigation technique. = 我们用天文导航技术找到了余纬。


现在完成时:
Scientists have used colatitude in many geographical models. = 科学家们已经在许多地理模型中使用了余纬。
They have determined the colatitude of several key points. = 他们已经确定了几个关键点的余纬。


过去完成时:
Before the calculation, we had already known the latitude. = 计算之前，我们已经知道纬度了。
They had determined the colatitude before starting the experiment. = 他们在开始实验之前已经确定了余纬。


将来时:
We will calculate the colatitude using a new algorithm. = 我们将使用一种新的算法来计算余纬。
Astronomers will use colatitude in their future observations. = 天文学家们将在他们未来的观测中使用余纬。


虚拟语气:
If we knew the latitude, we could easily find the colatitude. = 如果我们知道纬度，就能很容易地找到余纬。
I wish I had understood the concept of colatitude earlier. = 我真希望我早点理解余纬的概念。


被动语态:
The colatitude was calculated using a sophisticated computer program. = 余纬是使用复杂的计算机程序计算出来的。
The colatitude is often determined by subtracting the latitude from 90 degrees. = 余纬通常通过从90度减去纬度来确定。


疑问句:
What is the colatitude of this star? = 这颗星星的余纬是多少？
Can you tell me the colatitude of that island? = 你能告诉我那个岛屿的余纬吗？


否定句:
The colatitude was not accurately measured. = 余纬没有被精确测量。
We did not know the colatitude before the calculation. = 计算之前我们不知道余纬。


PHRASE->
colatitude calculation = 余纬计算
geographical colatitude = 地理余纬
celestial colatitude = 天球余纬
colatitude and latitude = 余纬和纬度
determine colatitude = 确定余纬
