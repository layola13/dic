词源:  Derived from "coy," meaning shy or bashful.  The suffix "-ish" adds a slightly diminishing or less intense quality, suggesting a hint of shyness rather than full-blown shyness.  The ultimate origin is uncertain, but some etymologists suggest a connection to the Old French word "coi," meaning "quiet" or "still."
