词源:
The word "interlope" comes from the Dutch word "interloper," which itself is a compound of "inter" (between) and "loopen" (to run).  Originally, it referred to those who traded illegally in areas controlled by a chartered company, essentially "running between" the established trade routes and regulations.  The word subsequently broadened to include any unauthorized intrusion or interference.
