词源:
The word "pettable" is derived from the verb "pet," meaning to gently stroke an animal or person.  The suffix "-able" is added to create an adjective indicating the capacity or suitability for being petted.  The root of "pet" is uncertain but possibly related to Old French words associated with caressing or stroking.
