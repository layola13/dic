词源:
The word "outbrave" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent than") and the verb "brave" (meaning "to face bravely").  Therefore, it literally means "to brave more than," or "to surpass in bravery."  The word's origins trace back to the Old English word "bræf," meaning "bold, brave."
