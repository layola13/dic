self-impregnator: /ˌsɛlfɪmˈprɛɡneɪtər/ | n. | 自体受精者；自花授粉植物 | A self-impregnator is a plant or organism capable of self-fertilization or self-pollination.  It refers to an entity that can reproduce without the need for another individual of the same species.  The term is primarily used in botany and biology. | Example:  Some species of plants are self-impregnators, meaning they can produce seeds without cross-pollination.  一些植物物种是自体受精的，这意味着它们可以在没有异花授粉的情况下产生种子。 | Near synonyms: self-fertilizer, autogamous organism | Antonyms:  cross-pollinator, allogamous organism | noun

一般现在时:
The plant acts as a self-impregnator. = 这植物充当自体受精者。
This organism is a self-impregnator. = 这个有机体是自体受精者。


一般过去时:
The flower self-impregnated. = 这朵花进行了自体受精。
That species was known as a self-impregnator. = 那个物种被称为自体受精者。


现在完成时:
The plant has self-impregnated successfully. = 这植物成功地进行了自体受精。
The scientist has identified several new self-impregnators. = 科学家已经鉴别出几种新的自体受精者。


过去完成时:
The plant had already self-impregnated before the observation. = 在观察之前，这植物已经进行了自体受精。
The researchers had discovered that the organism was a self-impregnator. = 研究人员发现该生物是自体受精者。


将来时:
The flower will self-impregnate soon. = 这朵花很快就会进行自体受精。
Scientists believe this new species will be a successful self-impregnator. = 科学家相信这个新物种将成为一个成功的自体受精者。


虚拟语气:
If the plant were a self-impregnator, it would reproduce easily. = 如果这植物是自体受精的，它就能很容易地繁殖。
I wish I had known this species was a self-impregnator earlier. = 我真希望我早点知道这个物种是自体受精的。


被动语态:
The seeds were produced by a self-impregnator. = 这些种子是由自体受精者产生的。
The self-impregnator was studied extensively. = 对自体受精者进行了广泛的研究。


疑问句:
Is this plant a self-impregnator? = 这植物是自体受精的吗？
Are there any known self-impregnators in this region? = 在这个地区有任何已知的自体受精者吗？


否定句:
This plant is not a self-impregnator; it requires cross-pollination. = 这植物不是自体受精的；它需要异花授粉。
That species is not considered a self-impregnator. = 那个物种不被认为是自体受精者。


PHRASE->
self-impregnating plant = 自体受精植物
mechanism of self-impregnation = 自体受精机制
rate of self-impregnation = 自体受精率
self-impregnation in plants = 植物的自体受精
advantages of self-impregnation = 自体受精的优势
