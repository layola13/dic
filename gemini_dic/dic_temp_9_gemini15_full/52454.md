dielectric:/ˌdaɪɪˈlɛktrɪk/| n. |电介质，绝缘体 |A dielectric is a substance that is a poor conductor of electricity but can store electrical energy when subjected to an electric field.  This is due to its ability to polarize in response to the field.  |Example:  The capacitor uses a dielectric material between its plates to store charge. 电容器使用电介质材料在其极板之间储存电荷。  The air acts as a dielectric in this experiment.  在这个实验中，空气充当电介质。|近义词：insulator, isolator |反义词：conductor |名词
