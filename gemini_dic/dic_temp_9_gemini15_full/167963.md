词源:
The word "prioritise" is derived from the word "priority," which itself comes from the Old French word "priorité," meaning "priority, precedence."  The "-ise" suffix is a common verb-forming suffix in English, indicating to make or do something.  Therefore, "prioritise" means "to treat something as a priority."
