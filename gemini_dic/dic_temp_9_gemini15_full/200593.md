词源:

The word "slave-driver" is a compound word.  "Slave" refers to someone who is forced to work against their will, and "driver" refers to someone who forces or compels others to work hard. The term originated in the context of slavery, where overseers literally drove enslaved people to work relentlessly. The term has since evolved to describe anyone who is excessively demanding and exploitative in the workplace, regardless of the presence of literal slavery.
