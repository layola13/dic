词源:

The word "nongarrulous" is a combination of the prefix "non-" meaning "not" and the adjective "garrulous," which means "excessively talkative."  "Garrulous" itself originates from the Latin word "garrire," meaning "to chatter" or "to prate."

用法说明:

Nongarrulous is used to describe someone who is not talkative or who speaks very little.  It implies a deliberate or habitual reticence, rather than simply being temporarily quiet.  The word carries a slightly more formal tone than simply saying "quiet" or "shy."
