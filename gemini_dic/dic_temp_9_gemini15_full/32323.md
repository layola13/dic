chilblain:/ˈtʃɪlbleɪn/| n.|冻疮|A chilblain is a red, itchy, and painful swelling on the skin, usually on the fingers or toes, caused by exposure to cold and damp conditions.

They are not usually serious, but can be uncomfortable. |Example:  The children got chilblains on their toes after playing in the snow for too long. 孩子们在雪地里玩得太久，脚趾上长了冻疮。


Example:  She suffered from recurring chilblains every winter. 她每年冬天都反复遭受冻疮的困扰。

词源:
The word "chilblain" comes from the Middle English "kilblaine,"  a combination of "kil" (meaning "chill" or "cold") and "blaine" (possibly related to the Old French "bleine," meaning "blister" or "inflammation").  The evolution reflects the condition's association with cold and its characteristic swelling.
