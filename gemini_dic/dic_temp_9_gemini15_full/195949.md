sensors: /ˈsɛnsərz/ | n. |传感器，感官 |A device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment.  Sensors convert physical phenomena into electrical signals that can be processed by a computer or other electronic device.  |例句：The car's sensors detected an obstacle and automatically braked.  这辆车的传感器检测到障碍物并自动刹车。

例句：The robot uses a variety of sensors, including proximity sensors and cameras, to navigate its environment.  这个机器人使用各种传感器，包括接近传感器和摄像头，来导航其环境。


近义词：detector, transducer, receiver | 反义词：N/A | 词性：名词


词源：源自拉丁语 *sentire “to feel, perceive”，与“sense”（感觉）同源。


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The sensors monitor the temperature constantly. = 传感器持续监测温度。
These sensors detect changes in light levels. = 这些传感器检测光线强度的变化。


一般过去时:
The sensors failed to detect the leak. = 传感器未能检测到泄漏。
The sensors registered a sudden increase in pressure. = 传感器记录到压力突然升高。


现在完成时:
The sensors have recorded a significant amount of data. = 传感器已经记录了大量的资料。
The sensors have been malfunctioning recently. = 传感器最近一直出现故障。


过去完成时:
The sensors had already detected the problem before the alarm sounded. = 警报响起之前，传感器就已经检测到问题了。
The system had failed because the sensors had been damaged. = 系统失效是因为传感器受损。


将来时:
The new sensors will improve the accuracy of the measurements. = 新传感器将提高测量的精度。
The sensors will automatically shut down the system if a fault is detected. = 如果检测到故障，传感器将自动关闭系统。


虚拟语气:
If the sensors were more sensitive, they would detect smaller changes. = 如果传感器更灵敏，它们就能检测到更小的变化。
It is essential that the sensors be calibrated regularly. = 定期校准传感器至关重要。


被动语态:
The temperature is monitored by the sensors. = 温度由传感器监测。
The data is being processed by the sensors. = 数据正在由传感器处理。


疑问句:
What type of sensors are used in this device? = 这个设备使用了什么类型的传感器？
Are the sensors working correctly? = 传感器工作正常吗？


否定句:
The sensors did not detect any anomalies. = 传感器没有检测到任何异常。
The sensors are not sensitive enough to measure such small changes. = 传感器不够灵敏，无法测量如此微小的变化。
