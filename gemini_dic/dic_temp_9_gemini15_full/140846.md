词源: The term combines the preposition "on" indicating a state of being, and "the bum," which is informal slang for "behind" or "buttocks," but in this context, it's a euphemism for a penniless and unemployed state.  The exact origin is obscure, but it likely emerged from the image of someone wandering aimlessly, relying on whatever scraps of support they could find.  The "bum" part subtly references the act of begging or scavenging.
