词源:

The word "putidness" derives from the adjective "putid," which comes from the Latin word "putridus," meaning "rotten," "foul," or "decayed."  Over time, the meaning shifted from literal decay to a figurative sense of something morally or intellectually corrupt, stale, or lacking vitality.  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being putid.
