词源:

The phrasal verb "muffle up" combines the verb "muffle," meaning to wrap or cover something to deaden sound or keep something warm, and the adverb "up," intensifying the action.  The origin of "muffle" itself is from the Old French "mofler," possibly related to the Old High German "mumpfen," meaning "to mumble."  The sense of wrapping for warmth developed later.
