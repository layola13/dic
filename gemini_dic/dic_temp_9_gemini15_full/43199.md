词源:  The word "crabbish" ultimately derives from the Old English word "crabbe," meaning "crab."  The association likely stems from the crab's sideways movement and perceived ill-temper, suggesting a grumpy or irritable nature.  The "-ish" suffix adds a slightly less intense or less formal quality to the word.
