词源:
The word "butty" as a term for a friend is of uncertain origin, but possibly derives from a shortening of "butty-boy" or other similar terms of endearment amongst working-class people in Northern England.  The use of "butty" for a sandwich is thought to derive from the Butter-and-Tea sandwich, originating in the same area, and is a regional variation.
