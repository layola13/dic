The word "colonialnesses" is not a standard or commonly used word in the English language.  It's a relatively rare and newly coined word, likely formed by adding the plural suffix "-nesses" to "colonial," creating a noun referring to the multiple aspects or manifestations of colonialism.

**Etymology:**

* **colonial:**  Derived from "colony," ultimately from Latin *colonia* meaning "farm," "settlement," or "district."  The suffix "-al" transforms the noun into an adjective.
* **-nesses:**  A plural suffix added to nouns ending in "-ness" (itself a suffix indicating a state or quality).  The addition of "-nesses" indicates multiple qualities or characteristics.

**Usage:**

While not a standard word, its meaning is clear from its construction.  It refers to the various aspects or expressions of colonial attitudes, policies, and practices.  It suggests a multiplicity of colonial influences, characteristics, or behaviors.  One could use it to describe:
