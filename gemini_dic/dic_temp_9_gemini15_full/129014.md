The word "nisey" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word. Please double-check the spelling.
* **It's a slang term or regional dialect word:**  Its meaning would depend heavily on context and geographic location.  More information is needed.
* **It's a newly coined word or a proper noun:**  Without further context, its meaning and usage cannot be determined.


To get a proper analysis, please provide more context about where you encountered this word.  For example:

* The sentence or phrase in which it appears.
* The source (book, website, conversation, etc.).
* Any information about the speaker or writer's background.


With more information, I can attempt a more accurate analysis.
