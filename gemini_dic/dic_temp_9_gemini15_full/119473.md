micromillimeter: /ˌmaɪkroʊˈmɪlɪmiːtər/ | n. | 微毫米 | A micromillimeter is a unit of length equal to one millionth of a millimeter (10⁻⁶ mm) or one billionth of a meter (10⁻⁹ m). It's a very small unit of measurement rarely used in practice.  The term is a combination of "micro" (meaning one millionth) and "millimeter".  It's primarily of theoretical or scientific interest in extremely precise measurements. | The researchers measured the nanoscale structure with an accuracy down to the micromillimeter.  研究人员以微毫米的精度测量了纳米级结构。 | nanometer, picometer | kilometer, meter | noun
