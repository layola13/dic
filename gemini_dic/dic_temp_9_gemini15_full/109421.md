The word "leonies" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
2. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (a name of a person, place, or thing) not included in common dictionaries.  More context is needed.
3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word or slang term used within a specific community or context.  Again, more information is required.
4. **It's a foreign word:**  It might be a word from another language. If you can provide the language of origin, I might be able to help.


Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis. Please provide more context or confirm the spelling.
