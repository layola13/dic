词源:

The term "second-generation" is a straightforward combination of "second" (meaning the second in a sequence) and "generation" (referring to a group of people or things born or produced around the same time).  The word "generation" itself comes from the Old French *generation*, ultimately deriving from the Latin *generatio*, meaning "begetting, producing, birth".
