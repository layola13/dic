protomorphic:/ˌproʊtoʊˈmɔːrfɪk/ | adj. | 原型的；原始形态的 | Relating to or characteristic of a primitive or ancestral form; exhibiting the characteristics of a prototype.  The term often refers to structures or organisms that resemble the ancestral forms from which they evolved, suggesting a relatively early stage in evolutionary development. | Example: The protomorphic features of the fossil suggest a link to earlier species.  这个化石的原型特征暗示了与早期物种的联系。|近义词：ancestral, primitive, rudimentary | 反义词：advanced, derived, evolved


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The protomorphic structure is evident in this species. = 这个物种的原型结构很明显。
This organism exhibits protomorphic characteristics. = 这种生物表现出原型特征。


一般过去时:
Scientists identified protomorphic traits in the ancient artifact. = 科学家们在古代文物中发现了原型特征。
The analysis revealed the specimen's protomorphic nature. = 分析揭示了标本的原型性质。


现在完成时:
Researchers have discovered several protomorphic examples of this tool. = 研究人员已经发现了这个工具的几个原型例子。
Paleontologists have identified many protomorphic fossils. = 古生物学家已经鉴定出许多原型化石。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the protomorphic stage was largely unknown. = 在发现之前，原型阶段在很大程度上是未知的。
They had hypothesized that the organism possessed protomorphic features. = 他们假设该生物具有原型特征。


将来时:
Further research will reveal more about protomorphic forms. = 进一步的研究将揭示更多关于原型形式的信息。
Scientists will study the protomorphic structures more closely. = 科学家们将更仔细地研究原型结构。


虚拟语气:
If the specimen were truly protomorphic, it would revolutionize our understanding. = 如果标本确实是原型的，它将彻底改变我们的理解。
I wish we had more information about the protomorphic ancestor. = 我希望我们有更多关于原型祖先的信息。


被动语态:
Protomorphic characteristics were observed in the early embryos. = 在早期胚胎中观察到原型特征。
The protomorphic origins of the structure are being debated. = 该结构的原型起源正在被争论。


疑问句:
Are these features truly protomorphic, or merely primitive? = 这些特征真的是原型的，还是仅仅是原始的？
Is this a good example of a protomorphic structure? = 这是一个原型结构的好例子吗？


否定句:
The analysis did not confirm the protomorphic nature of the artifact. = 分析并没有证实文物的原型性质。
This species does not exhibit clearly defined protomorphic features. = 这个物种没有表现出清晰定义的原型特征。
