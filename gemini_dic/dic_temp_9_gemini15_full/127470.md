词源:
The word "necessary" comes from the Old French word "necessaire," which itself derives from the Latin word "necessarius."  "Necessarius" is formed from "necesse," meaning "necessary,"  and the suffix "-arius," indicating a person or thing connected with something.  "Necesse," in turn, is related to the Latin verb "necesse est," meaning "it is necessary."
