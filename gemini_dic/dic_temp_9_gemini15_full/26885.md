词源:
The term's origin traces back to a dance called the "cakewalk," popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States. This dance, often performed by African Americans, involved a competitive strutting and posturing, with the most graceful couple winning a cake as a prize.  Over time, the term "cakewalk" transitioned from describing this dance to describing any task easily accomplished, implying a lack of genuine difficulty.
