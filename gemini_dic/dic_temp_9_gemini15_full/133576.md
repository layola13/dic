nonflakily:/ˈnɒnˈfleɪkɪli/ | adv. | 不脆弱地；不轻浮地；不浮夸地 |  The word "nonflakily" is not a standard English word. It is likely a newly coined word or a misspelling. It seems to be formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to a word that might be intended to mean something like "flaky" (meaning unreliable, unstable, or eccentric),  thus implying a lack of those qualities.  The intended meaning would be something akin to "steadily," "reliably," or "seriously." |  There are no standard examples or usages as the word is not recognized.  |近义词: steadily, reliably, seriously, firmly | 反义词: flakily, unreliably, unseriously, capriciously | 副词
