词源:

The word "nonlimiting" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "limiting" (derived from the verb "to limit").  "Limit" itself has origins in the Latin word "limes," meaning "boundary" or "limit."  Therefore, "nonlimiting" literally means "not having a boundary" or "not restricting."
