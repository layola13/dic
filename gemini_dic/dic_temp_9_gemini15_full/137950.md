/nɒnˈwiːknəsɪz/ | n. |非弱点；优点；长处 |The term "nonweaknesses" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, likely created by combining "non-" (meaning "not") and "weaknesses."  It implies strengths or positive attributes, the opposite of weaknesses.  It is used to highlight positive aspects rather than focusing on shortcomings.  Because it's not a standard word, there is no established usage.  Its meaning is entirely contextual. | Example: Instead of dwelling on our weaknesses, let's focus on our nonweaknesses and build on our strengths.  (与其纠结于我们的弱点，不如专注于我们的长处并以此为基础。) |近义词: strengths, advantages, assets, pluses |反义词: weaknesses, flaws, shortcomings, disadvantages


USAGE->
This word, being a neologism, does not have established grammatical usage in the traditional sense.  However, it would follow the rules of noun usage.


PHRASE->
There are no established phrases using "nonweaknesses".  The word itself is too novel for established phrasal usage.
