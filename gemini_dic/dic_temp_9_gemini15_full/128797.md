The word "nightertale" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word), a misspelling, or a word from a very specific context (like a fictional work).  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  I can offer some speculative possibilities:

If it were intended to be a combination of "night" and "tale,"  a plausible interpretation and analysis would be:

/ˈnaɪtərˌteɪl/ | n. | 夜话；夜间故事 | A story told or occurring at night; a nighttime narrative.  This word is not in common use and would need context to be understood. | Example:  "He spun a chilling nightertale around the campfire." = 他在篝火旁讲述了一个令人毛骨悚然的夜间故事。 |近义词:night story, nighttime narrative |反义词: daytime story

PHRASE->
(Since it's a newly coined word, common phrases are difficult to provide.  Phrases would depend on how the word is used in context.)


Note:  This analysis assumes "nightertale" is a deliberate combination of "night" and "tale."  If it's a misspelling or has another intended meaning, the analysis would be different.  Without further context, this is the most reasonable interpretation.
