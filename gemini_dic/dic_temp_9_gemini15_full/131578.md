词源:

The word is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "compatible."  "Compatible" comes from the Latin "compatibilis," from "compati," meaning "to agree, suit, or be suitable."  Therefore, "noncompatible" literally means "not agreeing, not suitable, or not able to work together."
