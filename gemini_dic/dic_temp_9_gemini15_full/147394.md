词源：The word is derived from "overnice," which is formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") to the adjective "nice."  "Nice" itself has a complex etymology, ultimately tracing back to Latin *nescius ("ignorant," "foolish").  However, its modern meaning of "pleasant" is a much later development. The "-nesses" suffix is a pluralizing suffix indicating multiple instances of a quality or state.
