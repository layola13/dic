词源:  The word "crystalliform" is a combination of "crystal" and "-form," the suffix indicating "having the form of."  "Crystal" originates from the Greek word "krustallos," meaning "ice," later used to describe clear quartz crystals due to their resemblance to ice.  The "-form" suffix is of Latin origin.
