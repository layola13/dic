词源：

doubtfulnesses is the plural form of doubtfulness.  Doubtfulness derives from the adjective "doubtful,"  which comes from the Old English word "dūhtful," meaning "doubtful."  The suffix "-ness" indicates a state or quality.


用法说明：

Doubtfulnesses refers to instances or expressions of doubt.  It is used to emphasize the multiplicity of uncertainties or hesitations.  While grammatically correct, it's less common than using "doubts" or "uncertainties" in most contexts. The word is more suitable for situations where a multitude of separate doubts or uncertainties need to be highlighted.  It's not frequently used in everyday conversation.
