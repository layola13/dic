homodimer:/ˈhoʊmoʊdaɪmər/| n. |同源二聚体|A homodimer is a protein complex consisting of two identical protein subunits.  These subunits are often, but not always, linked by non-covalent bonds such as hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, or electrostatic interactions.  The two identical subunits associate to form a functional unit. |Example:  Many transcription factors exist as homodimers to bind to DNA and regulate gene expression.  许多转录因子以同源二聚体的形式存在，以结合DNA并调节基因表达。|近义词：dimer (a less specific term)|反义词：heterodimer (a dimer composed of two different subunits)

词源:
"Homo-" comes from the Greek word "ὁμός" (homos), meaning "same."
"-dimer" comes from the Greek word "δίμερος" (dimeros), meaning "two parts" or "double."  Therefore, a homodimer is a structure composed of two identical parts.
