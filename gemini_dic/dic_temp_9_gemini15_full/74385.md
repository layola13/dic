frameablenesses:/ˈfreɪməbəlnəsɪz/ | n. | 可构成框架的能力；可构成框架的性质 | The word "frameablenesses" is not a standard English word.  It's a contrived word formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" (indicating a plural of qualities or states) to "frameable," which itself is an adjective meaning "capable of being framed."  Therefore, "frameablenesses" would theoretically refer to multiple qualities or aspects of being frameable. However, due to its unusual nature, it lacks established usage and a clear definition. It would be extremely rare to encounter this word in any context.  |  No example sentences exist because the word is not in common use. |  N/A | N/A | n.
