The word "encolden" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specialized or fictional context.  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer some assistance.
