The word "nonconnivences" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  However, we can analyze its potential meaning and structure based on its components:

* **"non-"**:  This is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of".
* **"connivences"**: This appears to be an attempt to create a noun form from the verb "connive".  "Connive" means to secretly allow or be involved in something wrong or illegal.

Therefore, "nonconnivences" could potentially be interpreted as the *absence* of connivance, or the state of *not* secretly allowing or being involved in something wrong.


Since the word is not standard English, it's impossible to provide:

* **Pronunciation (/ˈɑːxən/):**  There is no standard pronunciation.
* **Word Attributes (n., v., adj.):**  The intended word attribute is unclear, likely a noun.
* **English Analysis:** A proper analysis requires a dictionary definition, which doesn't exist for this word.
* **Examples:**  No examples can be provided as the word isn't used.
* **Synonyms:**  No standard synonyms exist.
* **Antonyms:**  The antonym would depend on the specific context intended by the creator of the neologism.


If you intended to use a different word, or if you can provide more context where you encountered "nonconnivences," a more accurate analysis would be possible.  Perhaps you meant "non-connivance" (a more likely and grammatically correct form).  If so, please clarify.
