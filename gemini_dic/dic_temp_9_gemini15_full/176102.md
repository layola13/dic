raycasts:/ˈreɪkæsts/| n. |射线投射，射线检测|The process of sending out rays (typically virtual rays in a computer program) to detect collisions or intersections with objects in a 3D space.  This is commonly used in computer graphics and game development to determine visibility, object interactions, and other spatial relationships. |Example: The game engine uses raycasts to detect if the player's weapon hits an enemy.  游戏引擎使用射线投射来检测玩家的武器是否击中敌人。|近义词: ray tracing, collision detection |反义词:  None specifically, but the opposite concept would be ignoring spatial relationships.


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The game engine performs raycasts constantly to update the scene. = 游戏引擎不断进行射线投射以更新场景。
Raycasting determines if a projectile hits a target. = 射线投射确定弹丸是否击中目标。


一般过去时:
The program executed a series of raycasts to find the nearest object. = 程序执行了一系列射线投射以找到最近的物体。
The developers used raycasting to improve the game's physics engine. = 开发人员使用射线投射来改进游戏的物理引擎。


现在完成时:
The algorithm has performed millions of raycasts in the last minute. = 该算法在过去一分钟内执行了数百万次射线投射。
We have successfully implemented raycasting in our rendering pipeline. = 我们已经成功地在渲染管道中实现了射线投射。


过去完成时:
The system had already completed the raycasts before the graphics were rendered. = 在图形渲染之前，系统已经完成了射线投射。
Before the collision was detected, the program had performed multiple raycasts. = 在检测到碰撞之前，程序已经执行了多次射线投射。


将来时:
The updated engine will use more efficient raycasting techniques. = 更新后的引擎将使用更高效的射线投射技术。
Our next project will implement raycasts for improved realism. = 我们下一个项目将实现射线投射以提高真实感。


虚拟语气:
If the raycast hit an object, the game would register a collision. = 如果射线投射击中物体，游戏将注册碰撞。
It would be beneficial if the raycasting algorithm were optimized further. = 如果射线投射算法得到进一步优化，将会有益处。


被动语态:
A large number of raycasts are performed by the engine every frame. = 引擎每帧都会执行大量的射线投射。
The collision was detected by a series of raycasts. = 碰撞是由一系列射线投射检测到的。


疑问句:
How many raycasts are needed to render this scene accurately? = 需要多少次射线投射才能准确地渲染此场景？
Are raycasts the best method for collision detection in this application? = 在此应用程序中，射线投射是碰撞检测的最佳方法吗？


否定句:
The raycast did not detect any collisions. = 射线投射没有检测到任何碰撞。
The system does not use raycasting for its lighting calculations. = 该系统不使用射线投射进行其照明计算。


PHRASE->

perform raycasts = 执行射线投射
detect collisions with raycasts = 用射线投射检测碰撞
optimize raycasts = 优化射线投射
implement raycasting = 实现射线投射
raycast hit detection = 射线投射命中检测
