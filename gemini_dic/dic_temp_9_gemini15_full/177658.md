The word "recage" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a very niche context.

If you intended a different word, please provide the correct spelling.  If "recage" is a word you encountered in a specific context, please provide that context so I can help determine its meaning.
