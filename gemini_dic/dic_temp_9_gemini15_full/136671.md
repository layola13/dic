nonsecludednesses:/ˌnɒn.sɪˈkluː.dɪd.nə.sɪz/| n. |非隐蔽性；非隔离状态|The word "nonsecludednesses" is not a standard English word. It is a contrived neologism formed by adding the prefix "non-" to the plural noun "secludednesses."  "Secludedness" itself refers to the state of being secluded or isolated. Therefore, "nonsecludednesses" would theoretically refer to the absence or lack of secluded states or the multiple instances of not being secluded. However, due to its unnatural formation and lack of common usage, it is unlikely to be understood or used in everyday conversation or writing.|例句：The architect's design prioritized open spaces, thereby minimizing any potential nonsecludednesses within the building complex. (这个建筑师的设计优先考虑开放空间，从而最大限度地减少了建筑群中任何潜在的非隔离状态。) |近义词:openness, accessibility, exposure |反义词: seclusion, isolation, privacy |名词
