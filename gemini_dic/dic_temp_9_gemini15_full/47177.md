词源:
The phrase "day-and-night" is a simple combination of the nouns "day" and "night," used adjectivally to describe something that is continuous and without interruption, spanning both daytime and nighttime.  The origin of both "day" and "night" trace back to Proto-Germanic and ultimately Proto-Indo-European roots.
