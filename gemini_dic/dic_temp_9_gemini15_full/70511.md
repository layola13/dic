The word "filemot" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a neologism (newly coined word): If so, please provide context or origin so I can attempt to understand its meaning.
