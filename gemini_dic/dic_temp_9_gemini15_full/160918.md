post-Linnean: /ˌpoʊstˈlɪniːən/ | adj. | 林奈之后的，后林奈时代的 |  Relating to the period in biology and taxonomy following the work of Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778), characterized by developments such as evolutionary theory and cladistics, which significantly altered Linnaean classification systems.  |  The post-Linnean era saw a revolution in biological classification. | 近义词：post-Darwinian (if focusing on evolutionary aspects) | 反义词：pre-Linnean
