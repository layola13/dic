Etymology:  The word "non-subsistence" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "subsistence" (meaning "the means of supporting oneself").  "Subsistence" itself comes from the Old French word "subsistance,"  derived from the Latin word "subsistere," meaning "to stand under," "to exist," or "to maintain oneself."  Therefore, "non-subsistence" literally means "not existing" or "not providing the means of existing."
