词源:
The word "crankier" is the comparative form of the adjective "cranky."  The origin of "cranky" is uncertain, but it likely emerged in the late 19th century. Some etymologists suggest a connection to "crank," meaning a bent or crooked thing, perhaps implying a person with a "bent" or unusual personality.  Another possible link is to the nautical term "cranky," referring to a ship that is unstable or difficult to manage, suggesting a similar sense of unpredictability and difficulty in a person.
