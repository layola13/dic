词源:  The word "mischievous" comes from the Middle English word "meschief," meaning "misfortune" or "harm."  This, in turn, derives from the Old French "meschief," and ultimately from the Old Norse "misgerningr," meaning "wrongdoing." The "-ous" suffix transforms the noun into an adjective, indicating a characteristic or quality of mischief.
