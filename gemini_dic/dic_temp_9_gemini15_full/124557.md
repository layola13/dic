词源:
The word "mounting" comes from the Old French word "monter," meaning "to climb" or "to ascend."  This in turn derives from the Latin word "montare," which also means "to climb" or "to go up." The various meanings of "mounting" – whether physical climbing or a figurative increase – stem from this shared root.
