词源:

The word "reverendly" is derived from the adjective "reverend," which comes from the Old French word "reverent," meaning "reverent, respectful."  This, in turn, originates from the Latin word "reverens," the present participle of "revereri," meaning "to stand in awe, to revere."  The suffix "-ly" is added to form the adverb, indicating manner or way.  Therefore, "reverendly" literally means "in a manner of reverence."
