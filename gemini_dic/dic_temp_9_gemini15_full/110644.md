limuloidea: /ˌlɪmuˈlɔɪdiə/ | n. |鲎类 | Limuloidea is a superfamily of marine chelicerate arthropods, commonly known as horseshoe crabs.  They are characterized by their horseshoe-shaped carapace, long telson (tail spine), and book gills.  They are considered living fossils, having existed for over 450 million years.  They play an important ecological role as scavengers and their blood is used in biomedical research. | Example: The study focused on the evolutionary history of the limuloidea. 这项研究侧重于鲎类的进化史。 | 近义词: horseshoe crabs (常用名称) | 反义词:  无直接反义词
