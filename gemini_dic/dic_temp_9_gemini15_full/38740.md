词源:
From "condolence" + "-atory",  "condolence" itself comes from the Old French "condoleances"  meaning "sympathy," ultimately derived from the Latin "condoleo," meaning "I grieve with,"  composed of "com-" (together) and "doleo" (I grieve, I suffer).  "-atory" is a suffix forming adjectives meaning "relating to" or "tending to".
