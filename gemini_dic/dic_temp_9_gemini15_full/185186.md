The word "retos" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling, a word from another language (possibly Spanish), or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown in the requested format is impossible.  To provide the requested information, I need a correctly spelled word in English or clarification of the word's origin.
