The word "reformado" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a word from another language, possibly Spanish or Portuguese, meaning "reformed" or related to reformation.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis in the requested format.  To provide such an analysis, I need a word that exists in the English language.  If you can provide a different English word, I will be happy to help.
