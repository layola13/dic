nonpotential:/ˌnɒnpəˈtɛnʃəl/| adj. |非潜力的，非潜在的 |Not having the potential or capacity for something; lacking potential.  This word is primarily used in technical contexts, particularly in physics and engineering, referring to something that does not possess the capacity for potential energy or a potential difference.  |The nonpotential field is characterized by its dependence on the path taken. |近义词：latent, inactive, dormant |反义词：potential, possible, viable


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The nonpotential energy of the system remains constant. = 系统的非势能保持不变。
This nonpotential force does not store energy. = 这种非势力不储存能量。


一般过去时:
The experiment demonstrated the nonpotential nature of the field. = 实验证明了该场的非势能性质。
The engineers analyzed the nonpotential effects on the structure. = 工程师们分析了非势能效应对结构的影响。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several nonpotential interactions. = 科学家们已经确定了几种非势能相互作用。
Researchers have explored the implications of nonpotential forces. = 研究人员已经探索了非势能力的影响。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the nonpotential aspect was overlooked. = 在发现之前，非势能方面被忽视了。
They had not considered the contribution of nonpotential energy. = 他们没有考虑非势能的贡献。


将来时:
Further research will investigate nonpotential energy transfer. = 今后的研究将调查非势能的转移。
We will analyze the nonpotential components of the signal. = 我们将分析信号的非势能成分。


虚拟语气:
If the field were nonpotential, the results would be different. = 如果场是非势能的，结果将会不同。
I wish I had understood the nonpotential aspects earlier. = 我希望我早点理解非势能方面。


被动语态:
The nonpotential effects were measured accurately. = 非势能效应被精确测量。
The nonpotential energy is often ignored in simple models. = 在简单的模型中，非势能通常被忽略。


疑问句:
Is the force acting on the object nonpotential? = 作用在物体上的力是非势能的吗？
Are there any other nonpotential factors to consider? = 是否还有其他需要考虑的非势能因素？


否定句:
The system is not entirely nonpotential. = 该系统并非完全是非势能的。
The results do not support a nonpotential interpretation. = 结果不支持非势能的解释。
