词源:
The word "nonparasitical" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "parasitical" (derived from "parasite"). "Parasite" originates from the Greek word "parasitos," meaning "one who eats at the table of another."  Therefore, "nonparasitical" literally means "not eating at the table of another," implying independence and self-sufficiency.
