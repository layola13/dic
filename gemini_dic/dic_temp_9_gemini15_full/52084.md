diamagnet:/ˈdaɪæmæɡnɛt/| n. |反磁性物质|A diamagnet is a material that produces a weak magnetic field in opposition to an externally applied magnetic field.  Diamagnetism is a fundamental property of all matter, but it is usually very weak and is easily masked by other forms of magnetism, such as ferromagnetism or paramagnetism.  |Example:  Bismuth is a strong diamagnet. 铋是一种强反磁性物质。|近义词：diamagnetic material|反义词：ferromagnet, paramagnet
