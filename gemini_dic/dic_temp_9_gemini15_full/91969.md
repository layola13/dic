hypermutability: /ˌhaɪpərˌmjuːtəˈbɪləti/ | n. |高度可变性，超变异性 | The capacity of a system or organism to undergo extremely high rates of mutation.  This term is often used in the context of  viruses and RNA viruses in particular, due to their high mutation rates which allow for rapid adaptation and evolution.  It also applies to other systems exhibiting similar characteristics. | Example: The hypermutability of the influenza virus makes it difficult to develop a long-lasting vaccine.  流感病毒的高度可变性使得研制持久的疫苗非常困难。  The hypermutability of the genome contributes to its rapid evolutionary trajectory. 基因组的高度可变性促进了其快速的进化轨迹。 | 近义词: high mutability, extreme variability, rapid evolution  | 反义词: stability, immutability, constancy |  词性：名词
