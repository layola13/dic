The word "naran" is not a word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word?  Please double-check the spelling.
* **A word from another language:**  It might be a word from a different language, such as Spanish, Hindi, or another language.  If you can provide the language of origin, I can try to help translate and explain it.
* **A proper noun:**  It could be a proper noun (a name of a person, place, or thing) not found in general dictionaries.
* **A neologism (newly coined word):** It might be a newly invented word not yet widely used.


To provide the analysis you requested, I need the correct spelling and/or the language of origin of the word.
