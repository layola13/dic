The word "nonvocalities" is a relatively uncommon term.  It's not found in most standard dictionaries, but its meaning can be easily derived from its constituent parts.

* **non-:**  A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of."
* **vocal:** Relating to the voice or speech.
* **-ities:** A suffix forming nouns of abstract qualities or states.


Therefore, "nonvocalities" refers to things that are *not* vocal or related to voice.  It encompasses all forms of communication that do not involve spoken or written language.  This includes, but is not limited to:

* **Body language:** Gestures, posture, and physical movements.
* **Facial expressions:** Emotions conveyed through the face.
* **Proxemics:** The use of space and distance in communication.
* **Kinesics:** The study of body movement, posture, and gestures.
* **Haptics:** The study of touch communication.


Because "nonvocalities" is a less common term, there isn't a rich set of example sentences readily available. However,  the following illustrates its use:

* **Example 1:**  The anthropologist noted the subtle nonvocalities of the tribe, interpreting their silent gestures as a form of greeting. = 人类学家注意到了该部落微妙的非语言表达，将他们无声的手势解读为一种问候方式。

* **Example 2:**  Effective communication relies not only on vocalities but also on nonvocalities, requiring a holistic understanding of nonverbal cues. =有效的沟通不仅依赖于语言表达，也依赖于非语言表达，需要对非语言暗示有全面的理解。


**USAGE** (Examples are limited as the word is not frequently used;  the usage mirrors that of "nonverbal communication"):

* **General Use:**  The study examined the impact of nonvocalities on interpersonal relationships. = 这项研究考察了非语言表达对人际关系的影响。


This section requires more context-specific examples to accurately reflect the word's usage in different grammatical tenses.  The word itself is rarely used in active sentences in different tenses.  The focus is primarily on its descriptive nature within a sentence.  Therefore, examples showcasing tense changes would be artificial and less illustrative of its practical usage.
