词源:

The word "invigorating" comes from the verb "invigorate," which itself is derived from the Old French word "invigorer."  This word is formed by combining the prefix "in-" (meaning "in" or "into") with the word "vigor," which comes from the Latin word "vigor," meaning "strength," "liveliness," or "force." Therefore, "invigorating" literally means "filling with strength or energy."
