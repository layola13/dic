词源:
The word "quartermaster" is derived from the Middle English "quartour maistre," which literally translates to "quarter master."  "Quarter" in this context referred to lodging or accommodation for soldiers, while "master" denoted the person in charge.  The term evolved from its medieval origins as a responsible officer for the supplies and quarters of soldiers to its modern usage encompassing a wider range of logistical responsibilities.
