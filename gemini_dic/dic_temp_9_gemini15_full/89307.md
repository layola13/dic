词源:
The word "homoerotic" is a modern coinage, combining "homo-" (from Greek *homos*, meaning "same") and "-erotic" (from Greek *eros*, meaning "love," especially sexual love).  Therefore, it literally means "relating to same-sex love."  Its use became more prevalent in the late 20th century with the rise of gay rights activism and queer theory, offering a more nuanced term than simply "homosexual" to discuss the artistic, emotional, and aesthetic aspects of same-sex attraction.
