词源:
The word "elegiacs" derives from the Greek word "elegeia" (ἐλεγεῖα), which originally referred to a type of poem sung to the accompaniment of a flute, often expressing mourning or lamentation.  The Greek word itself is of uncertain etymology, but it may be related to words meaning "lament" or "wail."  Over time, the term evolved to specifically denote a particular metrical form, the elegiac couplet, and subsequently to describe the style and mood associated with such poetry.
