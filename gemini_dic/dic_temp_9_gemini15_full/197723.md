词源:
The word "shiftily" derives from the adjective "shifty," which itself comes from the verb "shift."  The original meaning of "shift" related to movement or change. Over time, it acquired a connotation of evasiveness and deception, leading to the development of "shifty" and subsequently "shiftily" to describe actions performed in a secretive or deceitful manner.
