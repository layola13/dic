词源:

The word "rebate" originates from the Old French word "rebatre," meaning "to beat back," "to repel," or "to drive back."  This evolved into the Middle English word "rebatten," retaining the sense of "to reduce" or "to deduct."  The modern usage focusing on financial deductions developed later.
