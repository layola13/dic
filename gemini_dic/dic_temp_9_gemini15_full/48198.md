WORD ORIGIN->
The word "decompressive" is derived from the verb "decompress," which itself comes from the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse") and the verb "compress" (meaning "to press together").  Therefore, "decompressive" literally means "relating to the removal or reduction of pressure."
