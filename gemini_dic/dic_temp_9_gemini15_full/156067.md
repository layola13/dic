词源:

* **photo-**:  From Greek  φῶς (phos), meaning "light".
* **polymer-**: From Greek πολύμερος (polymeros), meaning "consisting of many parts".
* **-izable**:  Suffix indicating "capable of being" or "suitable for".


The word combines the meaning of "light" (photo-), "many parts" (polymer-), and the capacity to be polymerized, resulting in "the ability to undergo polymerization when exposed to light".
