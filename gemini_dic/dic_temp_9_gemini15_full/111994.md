The word "lonelily" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  However, if it was intended as a combination of "lonely" and "lily," we can analyze those words individually:

**Lonely:**

/ˈloʊnli/ | adj. | 孤独的，寂寞的 | Feeling sad because one has no friends or company. | Example: She felt lonely after her friends moved away. 她朋友搬走后感到很孤独。 |近义词： solitary, isolated, desolate |反义词： sociable, gregarious


**Lily:**

/ˈlɪli/ | n. | 百合花 | A bulbous herbaceous flowering plant of the genus Lilium, having showy flowers. | Example: The lilies in the garden were in full bloom. 花园里的百合花盛开了。 | 近义词： flower, bloom | 反义词： (no direct antonym, but could be contrasted with a weed or unattractive plant)


If "lonelily" was intended to be a descriptive word, it might suggest a solitary lily or a feeling of loneliness associated with a lily (perhaps due to its isolated beauty or symbolic meaning of loss/sadness in some cultures).  However, without context or confirmation of its intended meaning, further analysis is speculative.
