paracorolla:/ˌpærəˈkɒrɒlə/| n. |副花冠|A paracorolla is a structure in some flowers that resembles a corolla (the collection of petals) but is of different origin and structure.  It's typically formed from modified stamens or other floral appendages.  It often functions to attract pollinators or provide protection to the reproductive parts of the flower. | Example:  The paracorolla of this species is brightly colored, attracting hummingbirds.  这个物种的副花冠颜色鲜艳，吸引蜂鸟。|近义词:corona (in some contexts)|反义词:N/A
