over-expressed:/ˌoʊvərɪkˈsprɛst/| adj.|过度表达的，表达过度的|The term "over-expressed" describes a gene or protein that is produced at a higher than normal level.  This can be due to various factors, including gene mutations, gene amplification, or external stimuli. Overexpression can lead to various cellular effects, sometimes beneficial, but often detrimental to the organism.|例句：The cancer cells showed over-expressed EGFR receptors.  癌细胞显示EGFR受体过度表达。|例句：The study found that the gene was over-expressed in response to stress. 研究发现该基因在应激反应中过度表达。|近义词：upregulated, hyper-expressed|反义词：underexpressed, downregulated
