The word "nonshatters" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a newly coined word, a misspelling, or a word from a very specialized or fictional context.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide a response in the requested format would be misleading.

To help, we can explore possibilities:

* **If it's a misspelling:**  It might be intended to be a word like "nonshatterable" (meaning not easily broken or shattered),  "non-shattering," or a similar variation.  We could then analyze those words.

* **If it's a neologism:** If it's a newly coined word, more context is needed to understand its intended meaning and usage.

Please provide more context where you encountered this word, such as the sentence it appeared in or the source material.  With more information, a more accurate analysis can be provided.
