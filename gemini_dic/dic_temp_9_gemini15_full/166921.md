Etymology:

The word "prestidigitation" comes from the French word "prestidigitation," which itself is a combination of:

* "preste" (quick, nimble, ready)
* "digits" (fingers)
* "-ation" (action or process)

Therefore, the word literally translates to "quick finger action," perfectly reflecting the core of the skill.  Its origins trace back to the late 16th or early 17th century.
