phycocyanine:/ˌfaɪkoʊˈsaɪəniːn/| n. |藻蓝蛋白|A blue pigment found in cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and some red algae.  It's a protein that absorbs light energy, particularly in the orange and red regions of the spectrum, and plays a role in photosynthesis.  It also has potential health benefits and is used as a food coloring and dietary supplement.|例句：Phycocyanine is extracted from spirulina and used as a natural food coloring.  藻蓝蛋白是从螺旋藻中提取的，用作天然食用色素。|例句：Studies suggest that phycocyanine may have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. 研究表明，藻蓝蛋白可能具有抗炎和抗氧化特性。|近义词：biliprotein (a broader term)|反义词：None directly, but pigments with opposite absorption spectra could be considered indirect antonyms.
