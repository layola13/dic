词源:  The word is a compound of "self" and "clearance". "Self" is from Old English "sylf," meaning "self, same."  "Clearance" comes from the Old French "cler," meaning "clear, bright," ultimately from Latin "clarus," with the suffix "-ance" indicating a state or process.  Therefore, self-clearance literally means the act of making oneself clear or free from something.
