/ˌnɒnɪɡzɪˈstɛnʃəlɪzəm/ | n. |非存在主义|The philosophical position that rejects existentialism; a belief system that denies the inherent meaning or purpose in existence, often emphasizing the dominance of external forces or structures.  It often contrasts with existentialism's focus on individual freedom and responsibility.|  Nonexistentialism is a rarely used term, and its meaning is largely derived in contrast to existentialism.  There isn't a widely accepted body of philosophical thought explicitly labeled "nonexistentialism."  Instead, various philosophies that contradict existentialist tenets could be considered forms of nonexistentialism. For example, determinism, which posits that all events are predetermined, is a form of nonexistentialism. |近义词:determinism, fatalism, nihilism|反义词:existentialism|
