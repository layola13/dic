词源:
The word "outbulked" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "surpassing" or "exceeding") and the verb "bulk," which refers to size, volume, or mass.  The word therefore literally means "to surpass in bulk".  The root of "bulk" can be traced back to Old English *bulca, meaning "hump, swelling, bulge".
