词源：

The word "incoordination" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "coordination."  "Coordination" comes from "co-" (meaning "together") and "ordination" (from Latin "ordinatio," meaning "arrangement" or "order"). Thus, "incoordination" literally means "not working together in an orderly way."
