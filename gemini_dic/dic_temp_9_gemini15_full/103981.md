词源:

The word derives from "Juggernaut," a transliteration of the Sanskrit word "Jagannatha," meaning "Lord of the World," referring to a Hindu deity.  The name was applied to a large, ornate chariot used in a Hindu religious festival.  The image of this massive, seemingly unstoppable chariot moving through the streets, sometimes accidentally crushing people in its path, gave rise to the metaphorical use of "Juggernaut" to describe something powerful and unstoppable, often with destructive consequences.  The "-ish" suffix adds a slightly less intense or more approximate quality to the meaning.
