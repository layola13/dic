physostomi:/ˌfɪzoʊˈstoʊmaɪ/| n. |鳔通鱼类；硬骨鱼亚纲|A group of teleost fishes characterized by having a pneumatic duct connecting the swim bladder to the esophagus, allowing them to gulp air to adjust buoyancy. This contrasts with physoclisti, which lack this connection.|Example: Many freshwater fish belong to the physostomi group.|近义词: physostomous fishes|反义词: physoclistous fishes


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The physostomi gulp air to adjust buoyancy. = 鳔通鱼类吞咽空气以调节浮力。
Many freshwater species are classified as physostomi. = 许多淡水物种被归类为鳔通鱼类。


一般过去时:
Scientists studied the swim bladders of physostomi. = 科学家研究了鳔通鱼类的鱼鳔。
Researchers observed how physostomi control their depth. = 研究人员观察了鳔通鱼类如何控制它们的深度。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified many species of physostomi. = 研究人员已经鉴定了许多鳔通鱼类物种。
Scientists have extensively studied the physiology of physostomi. = 科学家们已经广泛研究了鳔通鱼类的生理学。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the classification of physostomi was unclear. = 在这项发现之前，鳔通鱼类的分类是不清楚的。
They had already known the physostomi's unique respiratory system. = 他们已经知道鳔通鱼类独特的呼吸系统。


将来时:
Scientists will continue to research the evolution of physostomi. = 科学家们将继续研究鳔通鱼类的进化。
Further studies will explore the diversity of physostomi. = 进一步的研究将探索鳔通鱼类的多样性。


虚拟语气:
If they were physoclists, they couldn't gulp air. = 如果它们是鳔闭鱼类，它们就不能吞咽空气。
It would be easier to study if all physostomi had the same characteristics. = 如果所有鳔通鱼类都具有相同的特征，研究起来会更容易。


被动语态:
The physostomi are classified into different families. = 鳔通鱼类被分为不同的科。
Their swim bladders are connected to the esophagus. = 它们的鱼鳔与食道相连。


疑问句:
Are all freshwater fish physostomi? = 所有淡水鱼都是鳔通鱼类吗？
What are the main characteristics of physostomi? = 鳔通鱼类的主要特征是什么？


否定句:
Not all teleost fishes are physostomi. = 并非所有硬骨鱼都是鳔通鱼类。
Physoclists do not have a pneumatic duct. = 鳔闭鱼类没有鳔管。
