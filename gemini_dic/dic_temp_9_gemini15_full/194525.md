self-sedimentation:/ˌsɛlfˌsɛdɪmenˈteɪʃən/| n. |自沉淀；自身沉降|The process by which particles in a suspension settle out of the liquid under the influence of gravity alone, without any external force or assistance.  This is distinct from processes like centrifugation which use external forces to accelerate sedimentation. |Example: The self-sedimentation rate of the red blood cells was measured to assess the patient's health.|近义词：gravitational sedimentation|反义词：flotation
