词源:
The word "extinguishing" comes from the Old French word "estinguir," which itself derives from the Latin word "extinguere," meaning "to put out," "to quench," or "to destroy."  The prefix "ex-" means "out" or "from," and the root "-stinguere" is related to words meaning "to prick" or "to pierce," suggesting the action of piercing or suppressing something.
