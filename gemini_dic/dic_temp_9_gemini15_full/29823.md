词源:  The word "cauliflower" comes from the Middle English "caulifloure," which itself derives from the Old French "chou-fleur."  "Chou" means "cabbage," and "fleur" means "flower," literally translating to "cabbage flower."  This accurately reflects the vegetable's appearance, as the edible part is the immature flower head.
