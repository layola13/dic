The word "pelo" is not a standard English word.  It's likely from another language, most probably Spanish or Portuguese.  Therefore, a full English-language analysis as requested is not possible.  To provide a useful response, I need more context.  Is there a specific language you had in mind, or a specific context where you encountered this word?  Knowing the source language will allow me to provide a proper analysis including pronunciation, meaning, usage, and etymology.
