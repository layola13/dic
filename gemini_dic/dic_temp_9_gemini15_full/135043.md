The word "nonnobler" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism, likely formed by adding the prefix "non-" to the word "nobler."  Therefore, a full etymological breakdown and standard usage examples are impossible to provide.

However, we can analyze its potential meaning and construction:


/nɒnˈnoʊblər/ | adj. | 不那么高贵的；非贵族；非高尚的 |  This word is a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "nobler" (the comparative form of "noble"). It suggests something that lacks the qualities of nobility, either in terms of social rank, moral character, or inherent worth. | Example:  "His actions, though intended to be helpful, were ultimately nonnobler in their execution." (他的行为虽然意图是好的，但在执行上最终并不高尚。) | 近义词: less noble, ignoble, base, unworthy, mean | 反义词: nobler, more noble, elevated, high-minded
