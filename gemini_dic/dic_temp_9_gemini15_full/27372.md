词源:
The phrasal verb "come across" originates from the Old English "cuman ofer," meaning "to come over" or "to traverse."  Over time, its meaning evolved to reflect the idea of unexpectedly encountering something or someone while traversing a space or area.  The current meaning, suggesting a chance encounter or discovery, solidified in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
