Etymology:

The word "dispensation" comes from the Late Middle English word "dispensaacioun," derived from the Old French "dispensation" and ultimately from the Latin "dispensatio," a noun of action from the verb "dispensare," meaning "to distribute, deal out, manage."  The Latin verb itself is composed of "dis-" (apart) and "pensare" (to weigh, consider).
