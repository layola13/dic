词源:
The word "rotograph" is a combination of "rotogravure" and "-graph."  "Rotogravure" comes from "roto" (referring to the rotating cylinder used in the printing process) and "gravure" (meaning engraving).  "-graph" is a suffix meaning "something written or drawn."  Therefore, "rotograph" literally means "an image produced by a rotating engraving process."
