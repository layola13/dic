irreducibly:/ɪrɪˈdjuːsəbli/ | adj. | 不可简化的；不能还原的 | Incapable of being reduced or simplified further; essential.  The complex system is irreducibly complex, meaning it cannot function if any of its parts are removed.  | 例句：The watch's intricate mechanism is irreducibly complex; removing even one tiny gear renders it useless.  = 手表的精巧机制是不可简化的；即使移除一个微小的齿轮也会使其失效。

The argument for intelligent design often centers on irreducibly complex biological systems. = 智能设计论的论据经常以不可简化的复杂生物系统为中心。


近义词：indivisible, unreducible, essential, fundamental | 反义词：reducible, simplifiable

词源:
