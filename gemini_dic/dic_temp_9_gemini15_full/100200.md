词源:
The word is formed from "inter-" (meaning "between," "among," or "reciprocally"), "resist" (meaning "to oppose or withstand"), and "-ibility" (a suffix forming nouns denoting capacity or capability).  Therefore, it literally means "the quality of being unable to be resisted between or among."  While not a common word, its construction is entirely logical given its meaning.
