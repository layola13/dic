The word "luny" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a slang term, or a word from a very niche dialect.  To provide the analysis, I would need a correct word or more context.
