The word "chivachie" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown cannot be provided.  It's possible this is:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A regional dialect word:** It might be a term used in a specific geographic location or within a particular community.  If you can provide context (where you encountered the word), it might be possible to find its meaning.
* **A neologism or invented word:** Someone may have created this word.

To help me assist you, please provide more information:

* **Where did you see or hear this word?** (e.g., book, conversation, website)
* **What was the context?**  (The surrounding sentences or situation would be very helpful.)

Once I have this additional information, I can try to determine the meaning and provide a more accurate analysis.
