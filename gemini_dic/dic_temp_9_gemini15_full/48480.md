词源:

The term "deep-six" originates from nautical slang.  "Six" referred to the six-fathom (36-foot) depth, considered deep enough to effectively dispose of something at sea. The "deep" emphasizes the thoroughness of the disposal.  Over time, the phrase moved beyond its literal nautical meaning and came to represent the secret or unceremonious disposal of anything unwanted.
