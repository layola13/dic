WORD ORIGIN->
The word "nonredemptive" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "redemptive."  "Redemptive" derives from the verb "redeem," which ultimately comes from the Old English word "rīeman," meaning "to rescue, to free."  This, in turn, has roots in the Proto-Germanic "*rauzōn," and further back to the Proto-Indo-European root "*h₂rew-," which has meanings related to "to pull, drag, save."  Therefore, "nonredemptive" literally means "not capable of rescuing or saving."

USAGE->


There is no grammatical tense information applicable to adjectives.  Adjectives describe nouns and don't conjugate like verbs.  The usage of "nonredemptive" depends entirely on the context of its use in a sentence describing something as lacking in redemptive qualities.
