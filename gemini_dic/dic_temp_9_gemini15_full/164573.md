preexceptionally: /ˌpriːɪkˈsɛpʃənəli/ | adv. | 异常地提前地；例外地提前地 |  The word "preexceptionally" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, a newly coined word, likely formed by combining "pre-," "exception," and "-ally."  It attempts to convey the meaning of something happening exceptionally early or before the expected time, but its unusual nature makes it unlikely to be understood without explanation.  Its meaning is derived from the component parts: "pre-" (before), "exception" (something unusual or outside the norm), and "-ally" (in a manner of).  Therefore, it implies an unusual level of earliness. |  The project was completed preexceptionally, ahead of schedule and exceeding expectations.  这个项目异常提前完成，超出了预期。|近义词: exceptionally early, unusually early, ahead of schedule | 反义词: exceptionally late, behind schedule | 副词
