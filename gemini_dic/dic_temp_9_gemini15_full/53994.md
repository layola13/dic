词源:
The word "discriminate" comes from the Latin word "discriminare," which means "to separate," "to distinguish," or "to discern."  The prefix "dis-" means "apart" or "away," and the root "-criminare" is related to the word "crime," suggesting the act of separating or distinguishing something as being different or distinct.  Over time, the meaning evolved to include the negative connotation of unfair or prejudicial treatment.
