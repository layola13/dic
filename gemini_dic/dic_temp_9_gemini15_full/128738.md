词源:
The word "niggard" originates from Old Norse *niggð, meaning "stinginess" or "miserliness".  It entered Middle English around the 13th century.  Its modern usage is heavily impacted by its unfortunate phonetic resemblance to a racial slur, rendering its use problematic and generally avoided.


用法说明:
Due to its controversial nature and potential for causing offense, the use of "niggard" is strongly discouraged.  While it once had a neutral meaning, its current association with racial slurs overshadows its original definition.  Choosing alternative words like "stingy," "miserly," or "parsimonious" is always preferred.  The potential for misunderstanding and offense far outweighs any perceived benefit of using this word.
