词源:
The word "potter" in this sense ultimately derives from the Old English word "potte," referring to a potter's wheel and the act of making pots. Over time, this evolved to describe someone who works slowly and leisurely, similar to the rhythmic movements involved in pottery making. The verb sense arose from this, describing a similar slow and often meandering activity.
