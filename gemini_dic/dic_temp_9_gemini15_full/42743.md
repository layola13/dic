The word "contourhouse" is not a standard English word found in dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism or a newly coined word, possibly a combination of "contour" and "house," implying a house designed with specific contours or shapes.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and standard usage examples are not possible.


Let's analyze the potential meaning based on its component parts:


**Contour:**

/ˈkɒntʊə(r)/ | /ˈkɑːntʊr/ | n. |轮廓，曲线；等高线 |The outline of a shape or figure.  A line on a map joining points of equal height. | Example: The contour of the hills was visible from the plane.  飞机上可以看到山丘的轮廓。|近义词：outline, profile, shape |反义词：interior, inside


**House:**

/haʊs/ | n. |房子，住宅 |A building for human habitation. | Example:  They bought a new house last year. 他们去年买了一栋新房子。 |近义词：home, dwelling, residence |反义词：outdoor, open


**Contourhouse (Hypothetical):**


/ˈkɒntʊəhaʊs/ | /ˈkɑːntʊrˌhaʊs/ | n. |(可能指)轮廓房屋，造型独特的房子 |A house designed with a distinct and often unusual or flowing outline or shape.  This could refer to architecture that emphasizes curves, unusual angles, or integration with the surrounding landscape. | Example:  The contourhouse blended seamlessly with the rolling hills.  这栋轮廓房屋与连绵起伏的山丘融为一体。(This is a hypothetical example based on the likely meaning.) |近义词：(This would depend on the specific design; examples might include:  organic architecture, modern architecture, avant-garde architecture)|反义词：(This is difficult without a specific design example; an antonym could be a boxy or conventional house.)



**USAGE (Hypothetical, based on a possible meaning):**

Because "contourhouse" isn't a real word with established usage, providing tenses and grammatical examples is purely speculative.  The usage would follow the normal rules of noun usage in English sentences.


**PHRASE (Hypothetical):**


This is extremely speculative, and phrases would depend on the specific intended meaning of "contourhouse":

* a contourhouse design: 轮廓房屋的设计
* build a contourhouse: 建造一栋轮廓房屋
* live in a contourhouse: 住在轮廓房屋里
* the contourhouse architecture: 轮廓房屋的建筑风格
* a modern contourhouse: 一栋现代风格的轮廓房屋


In summary, while "contourhouse" is not a recognized word, its likely meaning can be inferred from its components.  Further context or definition would be needed to provide more precise analysis.
