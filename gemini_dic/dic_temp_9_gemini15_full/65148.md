ethmoturbinal: /ˌɛθmoʊˈtɜːrbɪnəl/ | n. | 筛骨涡旋 |  A thin, scroll-shaped bony structure found in the nasal cavity; part of the olfactory system.  These structures increase the surface area of the nasal mucosa, improving the warming, humidification, and filtering of inhaled air. | The ethmoturbinals are crucial for proper nasal function.  | 近义词: nasal concha, turbinate | 反义词:  (None readily available;  the antonym would describe a lack of these structures, not a specific anatomical feature.)

Are the patient's ethmoturbinals inflamed? = 病人的筛骨涡旋是否发炎？
What is the exact function of these ethmoturbinals? = 这些筛骨涡旋的确切功能是什么？


否定句:
The patient did not show any signs of ethmoturbinal damage. = 病人没有表现出任何筛骨涡旋受损的迹象。
The study did not find a correlation between ethmoturbinal size and olfactory sensitivity. = 这项研究没有发现筛骨涡旋大小与嗅觉灵敏度之间的相关性。


PHRASE->
(Due to the highly specific nature of the word, common phrases are limited to medical contexts.  No common non-medical phrases exist.)
ethmoturbinal hypertrophy (筛骨涡旋肥大)
ethmoturbinal fracture (筛骨涡旋骨折)

词源:
From "ethmoid" (relating to the ethmoid bone, a bone in the skull containing the ethmoturbinals) + "turbinate" (referring to the scroll-like shape).  "Turbinate" ultimately derives from the Latin *turbinatus, the past participle of *turbinare "to whirl around," referring to the shape of the structures.
