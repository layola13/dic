decamer:/ˈdɛkəmər/| n. |十聚体|A decamer is a polymer composed of ten monomers.  In biochemistry, this often refers to a molecule consisting of ten nucleotides (a dekanucleotide), typically forming a short strand of DNA or RNA.  | Example: The researchers synthesized a decamer of adenine nucleotides for their experiment.  研究人员为他们的实验合成了一种腺嘌呤核苷酸十聚体。|近义词:dekanucleotide (for nucleotide decamers)|反义词: monomer, dimer, trimer (referring to polymers of shorter lengths)


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly in biochemistry and molecular biology.  Therefore, typical grammatical structures used with "decamer" will be found in scientific writing and are less likely to involve the common tenses and moods shown in the example for "what."  Instead, "decamer" is typically found in declarative sentences describing experimental procedures, results, or properties.

Declarative Sentences:
The decamer was synthesized using solid-phase phosphoramidite chemistry.  该十聚体是使用固相亚磷酰胺化学合成的。

The properties of the decamer were analyzed using NMR spectroscopy.  该十聚体的性质是用核磁共振波谱分析的。


PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases directly involving "decamer" as it's a highly specific scientific term.  Phrases would be built around its use in a specific context.  For example, you might see phrases like:  "decamer structure," "decamer stability," "decamer synthesis," "decamer binding," "decamer sequence."
