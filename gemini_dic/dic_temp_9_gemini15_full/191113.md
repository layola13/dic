词源:

The word "scapegrace" is a compound word.  "Scape" derives from the Middle English word "scap," meaning "shoulder" or "to escape." The word also has possible links to the Old Norse word "skapi," meaning "creature," or "shape."  "Grace" refers to divine grace or favor.  The combination suggests someone who has escaped the grace or favor of God or society, implying a lack of moral compass or good behavior.  The original meaning was more strongly associated with someone lacking divine favor and destined for punishment. Over time, the meaning softened to describe a mischievous but ultimately harmless character.
