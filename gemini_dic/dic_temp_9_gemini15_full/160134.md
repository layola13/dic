词源:
The verb "pomp" ultimately derives from the Latin word "pompa," meaning "a procession," "a grand display," or "a showy parade."  The sense of "making oneself look impressive" is a later development, reflecting the association of pomp with ostentation.  The usage relating to hair styling is a more recent and informal extension of this meaning, referring to the act of creating a full, showy hairstyle.
