reflectivity:/ˌriːflɛkˈtɪvɪti/| n. |反射率，反射性|The ability of a surface to reflect light, sound, or other radiation.  It is often expressed as a percentage of the incident radiation that is reflected.  The reflectivity of a material depends on its surface properties, such as smoothness and composition.|例句：The high reflectivity of the snow made it difficult to see in the bright sunlight.  雪的高反射率使得在明亮的阳光下难以看清。|The low reflectivity of the asphalt absorbed much of the sun's heat.  沥青的低反射率吸收了大部分太阳的热量。|近义词：reflection, radiance|反义词：absorptivity


USAGE->

一般现在时:

What is the reflectivity of the mirror? = 这面镜子的反射率是多少？


一般过去时:
The reflectivity of the surface was measured using a spectrophotometer. = 表面的反射率是用分光光度计测量的。
The reflectivity decreased after the surface was treated. = 表面处理后，反射率降低了。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the reflectivity of various materials. = 科学家们已经研究了各种材料的反射率。
They have improved the reflectivity of the solar panels. = 他们改进了太阳能电池板的反射率。


过去完成时:
The engineers had calculated the reflectivity before designing the system. = 工程师们在设计系统之前已经计算了反射率。
Researchers had found that the reflectivity varied with temperature. = 研究人员发现反射率随温度而变化。


将来时:
