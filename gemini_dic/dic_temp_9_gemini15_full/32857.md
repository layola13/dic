choliamb: /ˈkoʊliæmb/ | n. | 瘸诗；短诗 | A choliamb is a type of verse, specifically a line of iambic trimeter with a spondee or trochee in the final foot.  It is also known as a scazon or limping verse. Its effect is often humorous or satirical due to the unexpected metrical break at the end. | Example:  Many examples exist in ancient Greek literature, but providing a direct translation and maintaining the metrical effect is difficult without specialized knowledge of the ancient Greek language and meter.  A modern English approximation of the effect might be a line ending with a stressed syllable where an unstressed one would be expected. | 近义词: scazon, limping verse | 反义词:  (No direct antonym exists; the opposite would be a perfectly regular iambic trimeter)
