clinal:/ˈklaɪnəl/ | adj. | 沿线的；渐变的；逐渐变化的 | Relating to or characterized by a cline; showing gradual change along a geographical or ecological gradient.  The term often refers to variations in a characteristic (such as a gene frequency or a morphological trait) across a geographical area. | Example:  The species shows a clinal variation in size, with larger individuals found at higher altitudes.  该物种体型呈现沿线变化，海拔越高个体越大。 | 近义词：gradual, progressive,  | 反义词： abrupt, sudden, discrete |


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The species exhibits a clinal distribution. = 该物种呈现沿线分布。
This trait shows a clinal variation across the region. = 此性状在该区域呈现渐变变化。


一般过去时:
The researchers documented a clinal pattern in the data. = 研究人员记录了数据中的渐变模式。
The study revealed a clinal change in beak size. = 研究揭示了喙大小的渐变变化。


现在完成时:
Scientists have observed clinal variations in many species. = 科学家们已经在许多物种中观察到渐变变化。
Researchers have identified a clinal trend in gene frequency. = 研究人员已经确定了基因频率的渐变趋势。


过去完成时:
Before the study, they had not considered the possibility of a clinal effect. = 在研究之前，他们没有考虑过渐变效应的可能性。
By then, they had already observed a clinal pattern in the data. = 到那时，他们已经观察到数据中的渐变模式。


将来时:
Further research will investigate the clinal gradient more thoroughly. = 进一步的研究将更彻底地调查渐变梯度。
We will analyze the data to determine if a clinal pattern exists. = 我们将分析数据以确定是否存在渐变模式。


虚拟语气:
If the distribution were truly clinal, we would expect a smooth transition. = 如果分布确实是渐变的，我们期望看到平滑的过渡。
It would be helpful if we had more data to confirm the clinal nature of this variation. = 如果我们有更多数据来证实这种变化的渐变性质，那将很有帮助。


被动语态:
The clinal pattern was clearly demonstrated by the results. = 结果清楚地证明了渐变模式。
The data were analyzed to reveal the clinal variation. = 数据被分析以揭示渐变变化。


疑问句:
Is this variation clinal in nature? = 这种变化本质上是渐变的吗？
Does the species exhibit a clinal distribution across its range? = 该物种在其分布范围内是否表现出渐变分布？


否定句:
The distribution was not clinal; it was patchy. = 分布不是渐变的；而是斑块状的。
The data did not support a clinal interpretation of the results. = 数据不支持对结果的渐变解释。


PHRASE->
clinal variation = 渐变变异
clinal distribution = 渐变分布
clinal pattern = 渐变模式
clinal gradient = 渐变梯度
clinal trend = 渐变趋势
