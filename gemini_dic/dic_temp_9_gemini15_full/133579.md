/ˌnɒnˈfleɪkɪlinɛsɪz/ | n. | 非片状性；非薄片状；非鳞片状 | The word "nonflakilynesses" is not a standard English word. It's a nonce word, meaning a word coined for a specific occasion and not in common usage.  It's formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), the suffix "-nesses" (meaning "the state or quality of being"), and the root "flakily" (meaning "in a flaky manner").  Therefore, it attempts to describe the absence or opposite of something being flaky or in a flaky state.  This could refer to various contexts depending on the meaning of "flaky" used (e.g., not brittle, not unreliable, not uneven in texture). |  There are no standard examples because the word is not part of the lexicon. To illustrate the potential meaning, one might construct a sentence like: "The nonflakilynesses of the material ensured its structural integrity." (This suggests the material isn't brittle or prone to flaking.) |  Depending on the intended meaning of "flaky," potential antonyms could be  "flakiness," "brittleness," "unreliability," or "unevenness."  There are no true synonyms as the word is not established. | n.
