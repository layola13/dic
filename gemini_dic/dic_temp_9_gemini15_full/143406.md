词源:

The word "outflank" is a combination of "out-" (meaning "surpass" or "exceed") and "flank" (referring to the side of a military formation).  Its origins trace back to Old French "flanc" meaning "side, flank" and ultimately to Proto-Germanic.  The "out-" prefix reflects a common pattern in English to create verbs expressing exceeding or surpassing something.
