/pleɪt tekˈtɑːnɪksɪz/ | n. |板块构造学 |The study of the Earth's lithosphere, its division into plates, and their movement.  It explains phenomena like earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain building. |Plate tectonics explains the formation of continents and ocean basins. 板块构造学解释了大陆和海洋盆地的形成。  The theory of plate tectonics revolutionized our understanding of geology. 板块构造理论彻底改变了我们对地质学的理解。|geology, geophysics |(none readily available) |n.
