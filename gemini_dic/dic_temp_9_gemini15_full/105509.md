kilogrammetre: /ˌkɪləˈɡræmˌmiːtər/ | n. | 千克米 | A unit of moment of force or torque, equal to the product of a force of one kilogram and a perpendicular distance of one metre.  It is a measure of rotational force.  | Example: The engine produced a torque of 200 kilogrammetres. 发动机产生的扭矩为200千克米。 | 近义词: newton-metre (Nm) | 反义词:  None directly applicable;  the concept is of magnitude, not polarity.


USAGE->
一般现在时:

kilogrammetre measurement = 千克米测量值
kilogrammetre output = 千克米输出


词源:
The word "kilogrammetre" is a compound word formed from "kilogram" (a unit of mass) and "metre" (a unit of length).  It reflects the calculation of torque (rotational force) as the product of force (measured in kilograms when considering weight as a force) and distance (measured in metres).
