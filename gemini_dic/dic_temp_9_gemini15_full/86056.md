The word "heaper" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "heap" or "cheaper"?

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a regional dialect word, or slang not yet widely recognized.  More context is needed to understand its intended meaning.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (a name of a person, place, or thing), in which case, additional context is crucial.


Without knowing the correct spelling or intended meaning, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  Please provide more information or the correct spelling.
