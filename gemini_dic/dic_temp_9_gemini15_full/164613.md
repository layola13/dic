preexhausting: /ˌpriːɪɡˈzɔːstɪŋ/ | adj. | 预先耗尽的；使预先疲惫的 |  Describes an activity or process that exhausts one before the main activity begins. It implies a depletion of energy or resources in preparation for a subsequent task or event.


英文解析:The word "preexhausting" combines the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") with "exhausting" (meaning tiring or draining). Therefore, it describes something that causes exhaustion *before* the main activity or event.  This usually refers to a deliberate strategy in fitness training where a muscle group is pre-fatigued with an isolation exercise before a compound exercise.

The preexhausting set of bicep curls left me feeling weak during the subsequent pull-ups. = 预先做的二头肌卷发组让我在随后的引体向上中感到无力。
