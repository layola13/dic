sawfly:/ˈsɔːflaɪ/ | n. |叶蜂 |A sawfly is any insect of the order Hymenoptera, suborder Symphyta, characterized by a saw-like ovipositor used by the female to cut slits in plant tissue for laying eggs.  Sawflies are often mistaken for wasps or bees, but they lack a constricted waist.  They are plant-feeding insects, with larvae that are often leaf-eaters and can cause significant damage to crops and gardens. | Example: The rose bushes were infested with sawflies, their leaves riddled with holes.  玫瑰花丛被叶蜂侵染了，叶子布满了洞。
