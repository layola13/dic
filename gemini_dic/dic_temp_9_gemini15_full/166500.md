词源:

The word "presagement" comes from the Old French "presagement,"  itself derived from the verb "presager," meaning "to foretell" or "to foreshadow."  The root is ultimately Latin, connecting to words like "prae" (before) and "sagire" (to perceive or know).  Therefore, the word's core meaning points to a prior sense or perception of a future event.
