词源:
The word "rejuvenatory" is derived from the verb "rejuvenate," which itself comes from the Latin word "rejuvenare."  "Re-" is a prefix meaning "again" or "anew," and "juvenare" means "to make young."  Therefore, "rejuvenate" literally means "to make young again."  Adding the suffix "-ory" forms the adjective "rejuvenatory," meaning "relating to or having the effect of rejuvenating."
