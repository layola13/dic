词源:
The word "greenwood" is a compound word combining "green" (meaning green, fresh, lush) and "wood" (meaning a forest or wooded area).  Its origins lie in Old English, reflecting a long-standing connection between the descriptive term for a forest's vibrant, healthy state and the woodland itself.
