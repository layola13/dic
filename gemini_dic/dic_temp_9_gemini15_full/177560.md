词源:
The word "rebranded" is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "anew") and the word "branded," which itself derives from the Old English word "brand," meaning "a burning piece of wood," later evolving to mean "a mark burned or stamped on something."  The modern meaning of "brand" as a name and image associated with a product or company developed much later.  Therefore, "rebranded" signifies the act of creating a new brand or significantly altering an existing one.
