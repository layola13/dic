词源:

"In charge of" is a phrase, not a single word with a specific etymological origin in the way that individual words have.  It's a combination of the preposition "in," the noun "charge" (meaning responsibility or control), and the preposition "of."  The meaning arises from the combined usage of these words.  The sense of responsibility and control conveyed by "charge" has roots in Old French *charger (to load, burden), ultimately from Latin *carricare.
