The word derives from the adjective "cavalier," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "cavalier," meaning "horseman," "knight."  The sense of nonchalant disregard developed later, possibly linked to the image of a knight's seemingly carefree demeanor on horseback.  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun indicating a state or quality.
