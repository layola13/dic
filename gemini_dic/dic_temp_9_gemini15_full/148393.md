/ˌoʊvərˌsteɪbɪˈlɪtiz/ | n. | 超稳定性；过度稳定 |  The study of overstabilities focuses on systems that exhibit a higher degree of stability than typically expected, often leading to unexpected or undesirable consequences.  This can manifest in various fields, from engineering to economics.  Overstabilities can be beneficial in certain contexts, providing robustness against disturbances, but they can also hinder adaptation and innovation.  The term is relatively specialized and not commonly used in everyday conversation.  |  The aircraft's design incorporated several features aimed at enhancing its overstabilities during flight.  飞机的设计包含了一些旨在增强其飞行中超稳定性的特性。

The economic model predicted a period of overstability, which subsequently stifled growth.  经济模型预测了一段时间的超稳定，随后抑制了增长。|  There is no universally accepted single word as a synonym for "overstabilities". Depending on the context, one might use terms like "excessive stability," "hyperstability,"  "robustness (in a negative context)," or "rigidity". | instability, instability,  vulnerability |  n.
