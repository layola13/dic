repunished:  /ˌriːˈpʌnɪʃt/ | adj. | 再受惩罚的，再次受罚的 |  This word is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, meaning a newly coined word or expression.  It seems to be formed by combining "re-" (again) and "punished" (having received punishment).  Therefore, it implies being punished a second time or repeatedly.  There is no established dictionary definition or common usage.  It's likely to be understood in context, but might be considered awkward or incorrect in formal writing. |  Example:  He felt repunished for a mistake he had already atoned for. (他觉得自己因为一个已经赎罪的错误而再次受到惩罚。) | 近义词: punished again, repeatedly punished | 反义词: rewarded, forgiven, absolved |  adj.
