词源:
The word "reintrench" comes from the Old French word "retrancher," meaning "to cut off" or "to cut back."  The prefix "re-" indicates repetition or renewal,  and the root "trench" refers to a ditch or excavation, often used for defensive purposes.  Therefore, the original meaning was to dig a new trench for defensive purposes, which later evolved to include the broader sense of cutting back or reducing.
