/ˌnɒnsɛnsɪˈtɪvɪtiz/ | n. | 无关紧要的事；无意义的事；不敏感 |  The word "nonsensitivities" is not a standard English word. It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  It seems to be formed by adding the prefix "non-" to "sensitivities," implying a lack of sensitivities or things that are not sensitive.  Therefore, it would likely refer to things that are unimportant, irrelevant, or insensitive.  There is no established meaning or usage in dictionaries.  Because it's not a standard word, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage is not possible.  It's best to avoid using this word. |  (No standard example sentences can be provided) |  (No standard synonyms or antonyms can be provided) | n.
