词源:

The word derives from "heraldry" + "-ally".  Heraldry itself originates from the Old French word "herauderie," referring to the office and activities of a herald (a person who makes proclamations, especially in the past those who managed coats of arms and genealogical records for the nobility).  The "-ally" suffix is a common adverbial suffix in English, indicating "in a manner of" or "in relation to."
