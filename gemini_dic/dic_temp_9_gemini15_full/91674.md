词源:  The word is a combination of "hyper-" (meaning "excessive" or "beyond") and "civilized" (meaning "having a high level of cultural and technological development").  The prefix "hyper-" adds an intensifying and often negative connotation to the base word.  The word emerged in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as a way to describe societies or aspects of society that seemed to have taken the pursuit of civilization to an extreme.
