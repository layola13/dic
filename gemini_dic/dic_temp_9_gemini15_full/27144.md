词源:

The idiom originates from the ancient practice of identifying things by their true names.  "Spade" refers to a digging tool. The phrase implies that even if something unpleasant is revealed, it's better to be truthful and direct than to use euphemisms. The exact origin is uncertain, but its usage has been traced back to the 16th century.  The image is straightforward: a spade is a spade; it's not a shovel or a trowel.  Similarly, one should be direct and clear about the facts.
