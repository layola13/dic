The word "kosi" does not exist in standard English.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is not possible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?

2. **It's a word from another language:**  "Kosi" might be a word from a different language (e.g., Swahili, Zulu, etc.).  If you can provide the language of origin, I can attempt a translation and analysis.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or place name.  More context would be helpful.

Please provide more information so I can assist you effectively.
