constructor:/kənˈstrʌktər/ | n. |构造函数，构建器 |A constructor is a special method within a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created.  Its primary purpose is to initialize the object's attributes (member variables) to their initial values.  Different programming languages may have slight variations in how constructors are defined and used. | Example: In Java, a constructor for a `Car` class might initialize the `color` and `model` attributes.  `public Car(String color, String model) { this.color = color; this.model = model; }`  This constructor takes the car's color and model as input and sets the object's internal variables accordingly. |近义词：initializer, builder |反义词：destructor


USAGE->
(Constructors are not used in the same way as verbs or other parts of speech that have tenses and moods.  The examples below show how constructors are *used* in different programming contexts, not grammatical tenses.)

Example in Java:
Creating a car object using the constructor:

`Car myCar = new Car("red", "Toyota");` = 创建一辆红色的丰田汽车对象

Accessing initialized attributes:

`System.out.println(myCar.color);` = 打印汽车的颜色


Example in Python:

Defining a class with a constructor (using `__init__`):

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name, breed):
        self.name = name
        self.breed = breed

myDog = Dog("Buddy", "Golden Retriever")
print(myDog.name)
``` = 定义一个狗类，并创建一个名为Buddy，品种为金毛寻回犬的狗对象，并打印狗的名字。


Example in C++:

Defining a class with a constructor:

```c++
class Rectangle {
public:
    Rectangle(double width, double height) : width_(width), height_(height) {}
    double getArea() const { return width_ * height_; }

private:
    double width_;
    double height_;
};

int main() {
  Rectangle rect(5.0, 10.0);
  std::cout << rect.getArea() << std::endl;
}
```= 定义一个矩形类，并创建一个宽5.0，高10.0的矩形对象，并打印其面积。


PHRASE->
(Phrases related to constructors are typically programming-specific and depend on the language used. There aren't common English phrases in the same way as the example you provided for "what".)

Example Phrases in Programming Contexts:

default constructor = 默认构造函数
copy constructor = 复制构造函数
parameterized constructor = 参数化构造函数
destructor = 析构函数
constructor overloading = 构造函数重载
