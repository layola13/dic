refraction's: /rɪˈfrækʃənz/ | n. | 折射（refraction 的所有格） |  The bending of a wave as it passes from one medium to another; the change in direction of a wave passing from one medium to another.  It's a possessive form indicating that something belongs to or is related to refraction.  | Example:  The prism's refraction's effect was clearly visible.  棱镜的折射效应清晰可见。|近义词: bending, deflection | 反义词:  straight transmission (lack of bending)
