词源:
The word "explainers" is derived from the verb "explain," which comes from the Old French word "esplicher," meaning "to unfold, to spread out."  This ultimately traces back to the Latin word "explicare," which also means "to unfold, to clarify." The suffix "-er" denotes a person or thing that performs the action of the verb.
