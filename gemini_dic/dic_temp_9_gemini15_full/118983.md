词源:
The word "methamphetamine" is derived from a combination of "meth" (a shortened form of methyl), "amphetamine," and "-ine" (a suffix indicating an alkaloid or amine).  Amphetamine itself has origins in ephedrine, a naturally occurring stimulant.  The chemical synthesis and modification of ephedrine led to the creation of methamphetamine.
