homunculus:/həˈmʌŋkjʊləs/| n. |小矮人；(解剖学)脑皮质小人图|A homunculus is a representation of the human body, typically a small-scale model, used to illustrate various aspects of human anatomy or physiology.  In neuroscience, it often refers to a distorted depiction of the human body, where the size of each body part is proportional to the amount of brain area dedicated to processing sensory information from that part.  The term also has historical uses in alchemy and mythology, referencing artificially created miniature humans. | Example: The sensory homunculus shows that the hands and face are disproportionately large compared to the trunk, reflecting the high density of sensory receptors in these areas.  The motor homunculus illustrates the brain areas controlling different muscle groups. |近义词：miniature, figurine, model |反义词：giant, colossus


USAGE->

被动语态:
The homunculus is often used in neuroscience textbooks. = 小人图经常用于神经科学教科书。
The brain regions were mapped using a homunculus representation. = 大脑区域是使用小人图表示法绘制的。


疑问句:
What does the motor homunculus show us about brain function? = 运动皮质小人图向我们展示了关于大脑功能的什么信息？
Is the homunculus a truly accurate representation of the brain? = 小人图是否真正准确地代表了大脑？


否定句:
The homunculus is not a perfect representation of the brain. = 小人图并非大脑的完美表现。
