defract:/dɪˈfrækt/| v.|衍射；使衍射|To bend or spread out (light, sound, or other waves) as it passes around an obstacle or through a narrow opening.|The light defracted as it passed through the prism. 光线通过棱镜时发生衍射。|近义词：diffract, bend, spread|反义词：focus, concentrate


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The prism defracts the light. = 棱镜使光线发生衍射。
Sound waves diffract around obstacles. = 声波绕过障碍物发生衍射。

一般过去时:
The scientist observed how the light defracted. = 科学家观察了光线的衍射现象。
The experiment showed how sound defracted. = 实验显示了声音的衍射方式。

现在完成时:
The researchers have defracted the laser beam successfully. = 研究人员成功地使激光束发生了衍射。
Scientists have observed how water waves diffract. = 科学家们已经观察到水波是如何衍射的。


过去完成时:
The results showed that the light had defracted before it reached the detector. = 结果表明，光线在到达探测器之前就已经发生了衍射。
They had discovered that sound waves diffracted differently in various mediums. = 他们已经发现声波在不同介质中的衍射方式不同。

将来时:
The experiment will show how the X-rays will diffract. = 实验将显示X射线将如何衍射。
We will diffract the light using a new method. = 我们将使用一种新方法使光线发生衍射。

虚拟语气:
If the light defracted more, we would see a different pattern. = 如果光线衍射得更多，我们会看到不同的图案。
If the sound had defracted less, we would have heard a clearer sound. = 如果声音衍射得少一些，我们会听到更清晰的声音。

被动语态:
The light was defracted by the lens. = 光线被透镜衍射。
The sound waves were defracted by the wall. = 声波被墙壁衍射。

疑问句:
Does the sound diffract significantly at this frequency? = 在这个频率下，声音是否会发生明显的衍射？
How does the light diffract through the slit? = 光线是如何通过狭缝衍射的？

否定句:
The light did not diffract significantly. = 光线没有发生明显的衍射。
The sound waves did not diffract around the small obstacle. = 声波没有绕过小的障碍物发生衍射。


PHRASE->
light diffraction = 光衍射
sound diffraction = 声衍射
X-ray diffraction = X射线衍射
wave diffraction = 波衍射
electron diffraction = 电子衍射
