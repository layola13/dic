The word "preages" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis according to your requested format.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized field.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more informed response.
