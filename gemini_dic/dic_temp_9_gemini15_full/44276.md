Etymology: The word "crone" originates from the Old English word "crūne," meaning "old woman."  This term, in turn, is related to the Proto-Germanic word "*krūną," which also had similar meanings.  The evolution of the word's meaning over time has seen it shift from a relatively neutral term for an old woman to one carrying more negative connotations.  The association with witchcraft and unpleasantness likely developed over centuries, reflecting societal attitudes toward aging women.
