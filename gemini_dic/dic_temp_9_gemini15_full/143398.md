词源:
The word "outfitted" comes from the verb "outfit," which  originally meant "to fit out," with "out" meaning "completely" and "fit" meaning "to equip."  The word's origins lie in the Middle English word "outen," meaning "to provide."  The addition of "fitted" later cemented the meaning related to equipping or supplying.
