词源:
The word "refrain" comes from Old French *refrener, meaning "to bridle, restrain."  The "re-" prefix indicates repetition or intensification, and the root is related to words like "rein" (the strap used to control a horse).  Thus, the original sense implied holding back or controlling something, which has evolved into the modern meaning of avoiding or abstaining.
