USAGE->
This word is quite rare and doesn't have standard grammatical usage examples in the same way common words like "what" do.  Its usage is limited to descriptive contexts.  Grammatical tense and voice wouldn't be applied to it in a typical sentence.


PHRASE->
There are no common or established phrases using "earsh".  The word is too niche for that.
