nonextensive:/ˌnɒnɪkˈstɛnsɪv/ | adj. | 非广泛的；非广延的 | Not exhibiting extensive properties;  referring to systems where the properties are not simply the sum of the individual parts.  This is often seen in complex systems where interactions between components play a significant role.  |  The behavior of the sandpile is nonextensive, meaning the properties of the whole are not simply the sum of the properties of the individual grains.  |近义词：nonadditive, intensive | 反义词：extensive


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in physics and related fields, so grammatical examples in everyday conversational English are limited.  The usage will be in the context of scientific descriptions and explanations.

一般现在时:
The system's entropy is nonextensive. = 系统的熵是非广泛的。
This model demonstrates nonextensive scaling. = 此模型展示了非广泛的缩放。


一般过去时:
Researchers found the data to be nonextensive. = 研究人员发现数据是非广泛的。
The experiment confirmed the nonextensive nature of the phenomenon. = 实验证实了该现象的非广泛性。


现在完成时:
Scientists have observed nonextensive behavior in many complex systems. = 科学家们已经在许多复杂系统中观察到非广泛行为。
Studies have shown that this approach is more suitable for nonextensive systems. = 研究表明，这种方法更适合于非广泛系统。


过去完成时:
They had already determined that the system was nonextensive before starting the simulation. = 在开始模拟之前，他们已经确定该系统是非广泛的。
Researchers had previously explored the implications of nonextensive thermodynamics. = 研究人员之前已经探索了非广泛热力学的含义。


将来时:
Future research will focus on the application of nonextensive statistical mechanics. = 未来的研究将集中在非广泛统计力学的应用上。
We will investigate whether the model exhibits nonextensive properties. = 我们将研究该模型是否表现出非广泛特性。


虚拟语气:
If the system were nonextensive, the results would differ significantly. = 如果系统是非广泛的，结果将大相径庭。
It is essential that the model accurately reflects nonextensive behavior. = 模型准确反映非广泛行为至关重要。


被动语态:
Nonextensive properties were observed in the experimental results. = 在实验结果中观察到了非广泛特性。
The nonextensive nature of the system was confirmed by further analysis. = 通过进一步分析证实了该系统的非广泛性。


疑问句:
Is the distribution of particles nonextensive? = 粒子的分布是非广泛的吗？
Does this theory apply to nonextensive systems? = 这一理论适用于非广泛系统吗？


否定句:
The system's behavior is not nonextensive; it exhibits extensive properties. = 系统的行为不是非广泛的；它表现出广泛的特性。
The results did not support the hypothesis of nonextensive scaling. = 结果不支持非广泛缩放的假设。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases with "nonextensive" because it's a highly specialized term.  Phrases would be highly technical and context-dependent within a scientific paper or presentation. Examples might include:  "nonextensive statistical mechanics," "nonextensive thermodynamics," "nonextensive entropy," "nonextensive scaling," "nonextensive systems".
