词源:  The word "coinage" comes from the verb "coin," which originally meant "to strike (a metal) into a coin."  This meaning derives from the Old French word *coingner* (to wedge, to drive in), ultimately from the Latin *cuneus* (wedge). The sense of "to invent or create (a word or phrase)" is a later figurative extension of the original meaning.
