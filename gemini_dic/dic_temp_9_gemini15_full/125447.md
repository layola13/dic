multiplexer:/ˈmʌltɪplɛksər/ | n. |多路转换器，多路复用器 | A multiplexer is a device that selects one of several input signals and forwards the selected input into a single line.  It essentially acts as a digitally controlled switch.  Multiple signals are fed into the multiplexer, and based on a control signal, only one is allowed to pass through to the output. | Example: The video multiplexer combines signals from multiple cameras into a single feed for broadcasting.  多路转换器将来自多个摄像机的信号组合成一个用于广播的单一馈送。|近义词：selector, switch |反义词：demultiplexer


USAGE->

We don't need another multiplexer at this time. = 我们目前不需要另一个多路转换器。


PHRASE->
digital multiplexer = 数字多路转换器
analog multiplexer = 模拟多路转换器
frequency-division multiplexer = 频分多路复用器
time-division multiplexer = 时分多路复用器
data multiplexer = 数据多路转换器

词源:
The word "multiplexer" is a combination of "multiplex" (meaning "many folds" or "many channels") and "-er" (a suffix indicating an agent or instrument).  The root "plex" comes from the Latin "plexus," meaning "braided" or "interwoven."
