词源:
The word "roadways" is a plural form of "roadway," which combines "road" and "way."  "Road" comes from Old English "rād," meaning a ridden path. "Way" comes from Old English "weg," meaning a path or road.  Therefore, "roadway" literally means a path or route that is traveled.  The addition of "-s" creates the plural, referring to multiple roads or a system of roads.
