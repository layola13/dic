词源:  The word is a compound word. "Pro-" is a prefix meaning "in favor of" or "supporting," derived from Latin. "Australian" refers to Australia and its people, derived from "Australia," named after the Latin word "australis," meaning "southern."  Therefore, "pro-Australian" means literally "in favor of Australia."
