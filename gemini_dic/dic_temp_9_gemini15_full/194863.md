semi-coking:/ˈsɛmɪˌkoʊkɪŋ/| n.|半焦化|The process of heating coal to a temperature that drives off volatile matter but leaves behind a solid fuel that is intermediate between coal and coke.  It's a less intense process than full coking.|例句：Semi-coking is a crucial step in the production of certain types of fuel. 半焦化是某些燃料生产中的关键步骤。
The semi-coking plant utilizes advanced technology to enhance efficiency. 这座半焦化厂采用先进技术来提高效率。|近义词：low-temperature carbonization, partial coking|反义词：full coking, complete carbonization|名词
