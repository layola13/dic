词源:  The word "filtratable" is derived from the verb "filter" and the suffix "-able," which indicates capability or possibility.  "Filter" itself has roots in Old French *filtrer, ultimately from Latin *filtrare, combining *filum ("thread") and -are ("to do").  This reflects the original process of filtration using a thread-like material.
