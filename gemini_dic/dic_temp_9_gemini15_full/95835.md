用法说明:

incorporeally is an adverb describing actions or states that exist or occur without a physical body.  It emphasizes the lack of physical form or presence.  The word is primarily used in contexts relating to spirits, ghosts, or abstract concepts.  It's less common than its antonym, "corporeally."
