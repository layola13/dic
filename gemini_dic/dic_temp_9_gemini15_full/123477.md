monosulphide:/ˈmɒnəʊˈsʌlfaɪd/| n. |单硫化物|A chemical compound containing one sulfur atom combined with one or more other atoms.  Monosulfides are generally formed by the reaction of a metal with sulfur. They exhibit a wide range of properties depending on the metal involved.  For example, some are soluble in water, while others are insoluble.  Some are conductors of electricity, while others are insulators.|Example: Iron monosulfide (FeS) is a common example, often found in nature as a mineral.|近义词：sulfide (a more general term)|反义词：polysulfide (containing more than one sulfur atom)
