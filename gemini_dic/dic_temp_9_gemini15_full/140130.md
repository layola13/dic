词源:
The term "off-the-grid" is a relatively modern idiom.  It combines the preposition "off" (meaning away from or not connected to) with the noun phrase "the grid," which refers to the network of electricity, water, and other utilities.  The phrase's meaning evolved from its literal sense of being disconnected from utility grids to its broader metaphorical meaning of being independent and self-sufficient.
