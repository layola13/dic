The word "interrunning" is not a standard English word found in reputable dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized field.

If you encountered this word in a specific context, providing that context would help determine its intended meaning and allow for a more accurate analysis.  It might be a combination of "inter-" (meaning between or among) and "running" (referring to movement or operation), suggesting something about interconnected or concurrent processes.  However, without more information, any interpretation would be speculative.
