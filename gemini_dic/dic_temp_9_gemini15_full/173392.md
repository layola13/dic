用法说明:

"Quasi-educated" is primarily used as an adjective to describe individuals or their level of education.  It's often used in a slightly derogatory or critical context, implying that the individual has some level of education but lacks the depth of understanding or critical thinking skills associated with a truly educated person.  The term suggests a deficiency in the quality or completeness of the education received, rather than simply a lack of formal schooling.  It is not commonly used in formal writing.
