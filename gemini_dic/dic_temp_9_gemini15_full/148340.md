oversparingnesses:/ˌoʊvərˈsperɪŋnəsɪz/| n. |过度节俭；过分节省；吝啬 |The word "oversparingnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a combination of "oversparing" (itself uncommon) and the plural suffix "-nesses."  It implies excessive frugality to a point of being detrimental.  The word is likely to be considered awkward or unnatural in most contexts.  A more suitable word would be "excessive thrift" or "extreme parsimony."|例句：His oversparingnesses prevented him from enjoying life's simple pleasures.  他的过度节俭使他无法享受生活中的简单乐趣。(This sentence uses the word, but a better phrasing would be preferred.) |近义词：excessive thrift, extreme parsimony, undue frugality, miserliness |反义词：extravagance, prodigality, profligacy |名词


USAGE->
This word is not common enough to demonstrate usage across various tenses and grammatical structures.  Standard grammatical structures would apply if used (e.g.,  "His oversparingnesses were evident," "His oversparingnesses will be his downfall"). However, its rarity makes such examples contrived.

PHRASE->
Because "oversparingnesses" is not a standard word, there are no common phrases using it.  Phrases would have to be constructed based on the meaning, for example:  "The oversparingnesses of the times," "due to his oversparingnesses."  These are not established phrases.
