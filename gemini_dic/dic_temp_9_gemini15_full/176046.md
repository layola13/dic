词源:

The word "ravening" derives from the Old English word "ræfnan," meaning "to seize, snatch," ultimately related to the Proto-Germanic *hrabaną, "raven".  The connection lies in the raven's predatory nature and its association with devouring prey.  The -ing suffix indicates the present participle, signifying a continuous action.
