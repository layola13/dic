词源:  The word "self-design" is a compound word combining "self," meaning "of or by oneself," and "design," meaning "to plan and make something." The meaning is straightforward, emphasizing the self-directed nature of the design.  "Self" originates from Old English *self,  while "design" traces back to Old French desengier, ultimately from Latin designare ("to mark out, designate").
