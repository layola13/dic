词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "solicitousness," which derives from "solicitous" (meaning "showing concern or care").  "Solicitous" ultimately comes from the Latin "solicitus," meaning "anxious," "careful," or "concerned."  Therefore, "nonsolicitousness" literally means "the state of not being solicitous."
