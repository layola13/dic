词源:  The word "commonalty" derives from the Old French word "comunalté," which itself comes from the Latin "communalitas," meaning "community" or "commonness." The suffix "-ty" is an Old English suffix indicating a state or quality.  The evolution reflects the historical shift in meaning from a general sense of community to a more specific designation of the common people.
