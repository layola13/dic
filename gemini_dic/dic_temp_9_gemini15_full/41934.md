cosmometry: /kɒzˈmɒmɪtri/ | n. |宇宙测量学|The study of the measurement of the universe, including its size, structure, and contents.  It often involves techniques from astronomy, astrophysics, and cosmology to determine distances, sizes, and other physical properties of celestial objects and structures. | Example: Cosmometry is a rapidly evolving field, constantly refining our understanding of the cosmos. 宇宙测量学是一个快速发展的领域，不断完善我们对宇宙的理解。|近义词：cosmography, astrophysics (partially), cosmology (partially)|反义词：None readily available.
