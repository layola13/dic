isochor:/ˈaɪsəkɔːr/| n.|等容线，等容过程|A line on a diagram that connects points of equal volume.  It represents a thermodynamic process that occurs at constant volume.|The isochor shows the relationship between pressure and temperature at a constant volume.|近义词：isovolumic curve|反义词：isobar, isotherm


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in physics and thermodynamics, not in everyday language.  Therefore, providing examples of different grammatical tenses would be artificial and unhelpful.  Instead, I will provide examples demonstrating its use in scientific contexts.

Example 1:
The experiment was conducted along an isochor, ensuring constant volume. = 实验是在等容线上进行的，确保体积不变。

Example 2:
An isochor is depicted on the P-T diagram as a vertical line. = 在P-T图上，等容线显示为垂直线。

Example 3:
The isochoric process is characterized by ΔV = 0. = 等容过程的特点是ΔV = 0。

Example 4:
Analysis of the isochor data revealed a linear relationship between pressure and temperature. = 对等容线数据的分析揭示了压力和温度之间的线性关系。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "isochor." The term is highly specialized.  Instead, phrases related to its use in thermodynamics might include:

isochoric process: 等容过程
isochoric heating: 等容加热
isochoric cooling: 等容冷却
isochoric work: 等容功
P-V isochor:  P-V等容线图 (Pressure-Volume isochor)
