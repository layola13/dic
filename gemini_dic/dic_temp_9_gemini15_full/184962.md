词源:
The word "reckless" is derived from the Old English word "rēccelēas," which is a combination of "rēcce" (meaning "care" or "heed") and "lēas" (meaning "without" or "lacking").  Therefore, "rēccelēas" literally meant "without care" or "heedless."  The modern English word retains this core meaning.
