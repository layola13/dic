monocytoid:/ˈmɒnəʊsaɪtɔɪd/| adj.| 单核细胞样的 | Resembling a monocyte in appearance or characteristics.  It is often used to describe cells that share morphological similarities with monocytes, but may not necessarily share all of their functional properties.  The term is frequently used in hematology and pathology to describe cells observed in blood smears or tissue samples.|  The blood smear showed a significant number of monocytoid cells.| 近义词：monocyte-like | 反义词：N/A
