misclosure:/ˈmɪskloʊʒər/ | n. | 误差，闭合差，未闭合 | The discrepancy between the sum of measured values and the expected or known value.  It often refers to the difference between the beginning and end points of a survey, a calculation, or a process where they should theoretically match. | Example: The misclosure in the survey was only a few millimeters, well within the acceptable tolerance.  误差仅几毫米，在可接受的公差范围内。

The significant misclosure in the budget necessitated a thorough review of expenditures. 预算中的重大误差需要对支出进行彻底审查。

词源:

The word "misclosure" is a compound word formed from "mis-" and "closure."

* **mis-**:  A prefix indicating "badly," "wrongly," or "incorrectly."  It derives from Old English *mis-,* meaning "wrongly," "badly," or "ill."

* **closure**: Refers to the act of closing or the state of being closed.  It originates from the Old French *clos*, meaning "enclosed," itself derived from the Latin *clausus*, the past participle of *claudere*, meaning "to close."
