词源:
The word "irresistibly" is derived from the adjective "irresistible," which in turn comes from the verb "resist."  The prefix "ir-" means "not," and the suffix "-ible" means "able to be." Therefore, "irresistible" means "not able to be resisted." Adding the adverbial suffix "-ly" forms the adverb "irresistibly."  The root is the Latin verb *resistere* (to withstand, oppose).
