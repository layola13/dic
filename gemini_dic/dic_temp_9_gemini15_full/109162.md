词源:  The word "legitimately" derives from the adjective "legitimate," which comes from the Latin word "legitimatus," the past participle of "legitimare," meaning "to declare lawful."  "Legitimare" itself is composed of "legis" (of the law) and "timare" (to esteem, value).  Therefore, the root meaning points to something being deemed lawful or worthy by law or established standards.
