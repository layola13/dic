USAGE->
This word's usage is limited by its meaning and context.  It doesn't lend itself to the same grammatical variations as a common verb like "to be" or "to do".  The following examples illustrate its use in different sentence structures, but tense variations are less relevant than the context of cutting or slicing.

Simple Present:
The carpenter performs the kiri precisely. = 木匠精确地进行切割。
She makes a kiri of the apple. = 她把苹果切成一片。


Simple Past:
The butcher kiri the meat skillfully. = 屠夫熟练地切肉。

PHRASE->
There are limited common phrases directly using "kiri" in English.  Its use is more common within Japanese contexts or when specifically discussing the act of cutting in a particular way.  The following examples are more illustrative of contextual usage:


Kiri-boshi (きりぼし): A Japanese method of drying food by slicing and drying it (often referring to dried vegetables).
Kiri-jirushi (きりじるし):  A cut mark, or a mark made by cutting.


Note:  The word "kiri" in English is primarily borrowed from Japanese.  Its usage is quite specialized and not as flexible as many other English words.  Many similar words in English (such as "cut", "slice", "chop") would typically be used instead of directly using the word "kiri" in most English contexts.
