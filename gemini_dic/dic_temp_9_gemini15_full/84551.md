词源:  The phrasal verb "hammer up" combines the verb "hammer" (to strike repeatedly with a hammer) with the particle "up," which in this context implies completion or forceful action.  The origin traces back to the general use of "hammer" and the intensifying effect of "up" in phrasal verbs.  There isn't a single specific historical event or document marking its origin, but it's a natural evolution of English phrasal verb construction.
