词源:

The word "economising" comes from the noun "economy" and the suffix "-ising," which indicates the act of doing something.  "Economy" itself has roots in the ancient Greek word  "οἰκονομία" (oikonomia), which combines "οἶκος" (oikos, meaning "house" or "household") and "νεμεῖν" (nemein, meaning "to manage" or "to distribute").  Therefore, the original meaning was related to the management of a household, and later extended to broader economic principles.
