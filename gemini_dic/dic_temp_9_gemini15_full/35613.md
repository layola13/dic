词源:
The word "coaster" ultimately derives from the word "coast," referring to a shoreline.  The sense of "coaster" as something that "coasts" along a surface (like a glass on a coaster) developed later.  The application to amusement park rides likely arose from the association with a ride that goes up and down hills, much like navigating a coast.
