词源:
The word "condiment" comes from the Old French word "condiment," which in turn comes from the Latin word "condire," meaning "to season" or "to preserve."  The Latin word is related to the prefix "con-" (together) and the verb "dare" (to give).  Thus, the original meaning implied the act of enhancing or preserving food by adding something to it.
