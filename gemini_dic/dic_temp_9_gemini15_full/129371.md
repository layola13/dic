词源:
From Latin *nōmadēs, from Greek νομάδες (nomádes), plural of νομάς (nomás), "shepherd, herdsman," from νέμειν (némein), "to pasture, distribute."  Ultimately related to the English word "name".  The connection lies in the idea of assigning and managing resources (livestock, land) which is a key aspect of nomadic life.
