deformabilities: /ˌdiːˌfɔːrməˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可变形性；变形能力 | The ability of a material to be deformed under stress.  This term often refers to the capacity of a material to undergo changes in shape or size without fracturing.  It encompasses various aspects of a material's response to external forces, including elasticity, plasticity, and viscosity. | Example:  The high deformabilities of polymers make them suitable for a wide range of applications.  高聚物的良好可变形性使其适用于各种应用。

The engineers analyzed the structural deformabilities of the bridge under heavy load. 工程师们分析了桥梁在重载下的结构变形能力。


近义词：flexibility, malleability, plasticity | 反义词：rigidity, inflexibility

词源:

The word "deformabilities" is derived from the verb "deform" and the suffix "-abilities."  "Deform" comes from the Latin prefix "de-" (away, from) and the Latin word "forma" (shape, form).  The suffix "-abilities" indicates the state or quality of being able to be deformed.  Therefore, "deformabilities" literally means "the qualities of being able to be changed in shape or form."
