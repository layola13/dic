词源:
The word "nontumultuousnesses" is formed by combining several morphemes:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not."
* **tumultuous**: An adjective meaning "making a loud, confused noise; uproarious."  It derives from Latin "tumultuosus," from "tumultus" (tumult, uproar).
* **-ness**: A suffix forming nouns of state or condition.
* **-es**: A plural suffix.

Therefore, "nontumultuousnesses" literally means "the states or conditions of not being tumultuous," or more simply, "states of calmness or tranquility."  It's a rather unusual and unwieldy word, more likely to be found in academic writing than everyday speech.
