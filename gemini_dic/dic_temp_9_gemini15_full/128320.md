neurotoxin:/ˈnʊroʊtɒksɪn/| n. |神经毒素|A neurotoxin is a substance that is poisonous or destructive to nerve tissue.  Neurotoxins can be produced by living organisms, such as certain plants, animals, and bacteria, or they can be synthetically produced. They interfere with the function of neurons, leading to a range of effects depending on the specific neurotoxin and the level of exposure. These effects can range from mild neurological symptoms to paralysis and death. |Example: Botulinum toxin, a neurotoxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, is responsible for botulism, a potentially fatal disease.  The venom of some snakes also contains potent neurotoxins. |近义词：nerve poison, nerve agent, neurotoxic substance |反义词：neuroprotectant
