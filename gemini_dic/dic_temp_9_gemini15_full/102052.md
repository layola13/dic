isomeride:/aɪˈsɒməraɪd/| n.|异构体|Isomeride refers to a compound that exists in two or more forms with the same molecular formula but different structural formulas, hence having different properties.  These different forms are called isomers. The term often implies a specific type of isomerism, such as stereoisomerism, depending on the context.|Examples: Glucose and fructose are isomerides because they share the same molecular formula (C6H12O6) but have different arrangements of atoms, resulting in different sweetness and other properties.  Cis-trans isomers are another example of isomerides.|近义词：isomer, stereoisomer|反义词：无


USAGE->

(由于isomeride本身是名词，没有动词变化，所以没有一般现在时，一般过去时等时态变化的例句。以下仅提供名词的用法例句)

单数名词：
This molecule is an isomeride of the original compound. = 这个分子是原始化合物的异构体。

复数名词：
Several isomerides were identified in the sample. = 在样品中鉴定出几种异构体。


PHRASE->

(Isomeride is not typically used in phrases.  Phrases would be built around the concept of isomerism, not the word itself.)
