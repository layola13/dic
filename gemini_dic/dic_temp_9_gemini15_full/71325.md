Etymology:  The word "fjord" comes from the Old Norse word "fjǫrðr," meaning "ford," "inlet," or "bay."  The Old Norse word ultimately derives from Proto-Germanic *ferþuz, meaning a body of water that can be forded. This reflects the historical use of fjords as passageways.  The word spread through the Scandinavian languages and eventually into English.
