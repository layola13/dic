The word "groi" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a slang term or regional dialect word:**  If it's a slang term or used within a specific community, more context is needed to understand its meaning.
* **It's a neologism (newly coined word):**  If it's a newly invented word, providing the context in which you encountered it would be helpful.

Please provide more information or clarify the spelling so I can assist you.
