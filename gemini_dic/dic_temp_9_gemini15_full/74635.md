free-base:/friːˈbeɪs/| n. v.|游离碱；游离碱化|A free base is a chemical compound that is not a salt.  In chemistry, it refers to a base in its un-ionized form, as opposed to a salt of the base.  As a verb, it means to convert a salt of a base into its free base form.|例句：The chemist carefully extracted the free base from the salt. 化学家小心地从盐中提取游离碱。The process involved free-basing the cocaine. 这个过程包括将可卡因游离碱化。|近义词：un-ionized base, pure base|反义词：salt, ionized base|

USAGE->
