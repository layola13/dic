词源:

The word "perseverant" comes from the verb "persevere," which itself originates from the Old French word "perseverer," meaning "to persist."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin "perseverare," formed from "per-" (through, thoroughly) and "severare" (to bind, fasten, hold).  The suffix "-ant" is an adjectival suffix indicating someone who does the action of the verb.
