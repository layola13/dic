leukoplast:/ˈluːkəˌplæst/ | n. |白色体；造粉体 |A leucoplast is a colorless plastid, an organelle found in plant cells, that is involved in the synthesis and storage of various substances, including starch, lipids, and proteins.  Unlike chloroplasts, they do not contain chlorophyll and therefore do not perform photosynthesis. |Example:  Starch grains are stored in the leukoplasts of potato tubers.  马铃薯块茎的白色体中储存着淀粉粒。|近义词：plastid (更广泛的术语)|反义词：chloroplast
