neuropod:/ˈnʊroʊpɑːd/| n. |神经足；神经元足；神经突|A neuropod is a computational unit or a software component designed for efficient deployment and execution of machine learning models, particularly deep learning models. It focuses on optimizing inference (making predictions) rather than training the models.  Neuropods aim to provide a standardized way to deploy models across various hardware and software platforms without requiring significant code changes.|Example:  The researchers used a neuropod to deploy their object detection model on an embedded system.  研究人员使用神经足将他们的目标检测模型部署到嵌入式系统上。|近义词: inference engine, model server |反义词: N/A
