fractal-dimensions:/ˈfræktəl daɪˈmɛnʃənz/| n.|分形维数|A fractal dimension is a measure of the complexity or roughness of a fractal pattern.  It quantifies how the pattern fills space, going beyond the usual integer dimensions (0, 1, 2, 3) to describe shapes with self-similarity across different scales.  For example, a coastline's fractal dimension reflects its irregularity; a smoother coastline will have a lower fractal dimension than a highly convoluted one.|Example: The fractal dimension of the coastline was calculated to be approximately 1.25, indicating its significant irregularity.|近义词:fractal index, roughness measure|反义词:Euclidean dimension
