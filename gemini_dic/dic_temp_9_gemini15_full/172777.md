quadridentate:/ˌkwɑːdrɪˈdɛnteɪt/ | adj. | 四齿的，四价的 | Having four points of attachment or connection, especially referring to a ligand in coordination chemistry that can bond to a central metal atom through four atoms.  | Example:  The quadridentate ligand EDTA is widely used in coordination chemistry.  EDTA这种四齿配体广泛应用于配位化学中。 | 近义词:tetradentate | 反义词:monodentate, bidentate, tridentate


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The ligand acts as a quadridentate chelating agent. = 配体作为四齿螯合剂起作用。
This molecule exhibits quadridentate coordination. = 该分子表现出四齿配位。


一般过去时:
The researchers studied a quadridentate complex. = 研究人员研究了一种四齿配合物。
They synthesized a novel quadridentate ligand. = 他们合成了一种新型四齿配体。


现在完成时:
Chemists have used quadridentate ligands extensively. = 化学家们已经广泛使用了四齿配体。
We have identified a new class of quadridentate complexes. = 我们已经鉴定了一种新型的四齿配合物。


过去完成时:
They had already prepared the quadridentate ligand before the experiment. = 他们在实验前已经制备好了四齿配体。
Scientists had previously investigated the properties of this quadridentate complex. = 科学家们之前已经研究过这种四齿配合物的性质。


将来时:
We will synthesize a new quadridentate ligand next week. = 我们下周将合成一种新的四齿配体。
They will explore the applications of this quadridentate system. = 他们将探索这个四齿体系的应用。


虚拟语气:
If the ligand were quadridentate, the complex would be more stable. = 如果配体是四齿的，配合物将更稳定。
I wish I had known the ligand was quadridentate earlier. = 我真希望我早点知道配体是四齿的。


被动语态:
The stability of the complex was enhanced by the quadridentate ligand. = 配合物的稳定性因四齿配体而增强。
The reaction was catalyzed by a quadridentate catalyst. = 该反应由四齿催化剂催化。


疑问句:
Is the ligand quadridentate or bidentate? = 配体是四齿的还是二齿的？
How many coordination sites does this quadridentate ligand occupy? = 这个四齿配体占据多少配位点？


否定句:
The ligand is not quadridentate; it is only bidentate. = 配体不是四齿的；它只是二齿的。
The complex does not contain a quadridentate ligand. = 该配合物不含四齿配体。


PHRASE->
quadridentate ligand = 四齿配体
quadridentate chelating agent = 四齿螯合剂
quadridentate complex = 四齿配合物
quadridentate coordination = 四齿配位
quadridentate catalysis = 四齿催化


词源:
From "quadri-" (four) + "-dentate" (having teeth, referring to points of attachment).  The term is used analogously to describe the way a ligand "bites" onto a central metal ion.
