Word Origin:
The word "nonendorsements" is a compound word.  It combines the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the noun "endorsements."  "Endorsement" comes from the verb "endorse," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "endorser," meaning "to write on the back (of a document)."  This evolved to mean to give one's public approval or support to something or someone.  Therefore, "nonendorsements" literally means "not giving one's approval or support."
