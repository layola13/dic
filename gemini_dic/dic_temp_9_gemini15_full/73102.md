词源:

The word "foppish" derives from "fop," a term for a man who is excessively concerned with his appearance and dress.  "Fop" itself has an uncertain etymology, with suggestions linking it to Dutch words related to foolishness or to a possible alteration of the word "fop," meaning "fool" or "buffoon".  The "-ish" suffix adds an adjectival quality, transforming the noun "fop" into the adjective "foppish".
