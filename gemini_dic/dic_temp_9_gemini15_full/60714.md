electro-oculograph: /ɪˌlɛkˌtroʊoʊˈkjuːləɡræf/ | n. | 眼动图 | An instrument used to record eye movements. It measures the corneo-retinal potential, the electrical potential difference between the cornea and the retina of the eye.  These movements are typically recorded as a voltage change and can be used to study various aspects of visual attention, sleep stages, and neurological disorders. | The electro-oculograph showed a significant increase in saccadic eye movements during the task. 眼动图显示任务期间眼球快速跳动显着增加。|  electroencephalogram (EEG),  ophthalmograph |  (no direct antonym)
