destructured:/diːˈstrʌktʃərd/ | adj. | 解构的，已解构的 |  Describes data or objects that have been broken down into simpler, more manageable components, typically from a complex structure into individual parts. This is often done for easier processing or manipulation, particularly in programming.  | Example: The destructured JSON data was easily parsed by the application.  解构的JSON数据很容易被应用程序解析。 |近义词：decomposed, disassembled, analyzed | 反义词：structured, intact, whole |  形容词
