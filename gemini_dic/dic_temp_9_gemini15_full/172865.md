quadrupole:/ˈkwɑːdruːpoʊl/| n. |四极子，四极矩 |A quadrupole is a configuration of four point charges or more generally, any distribution of charge that possesses a quadrupole moment.  It's characterized by its quadrupole moment, a tensor quantity that describes the distribution's deviation from a pure dipole. In physics, quadrupoles are used to describe various phenomena, such as the electric field of a non-uniform charge distribution or the gravitational field of a non-spherical mass distribution. | Example: The electric quadrupole moment of a molecule can influence its interaction with external electric fields.  四极矩可以影响分子与外部电场的相互作用。|近义词: multipole (more general term) |反义词: monopole, dipole (simpler charge distributions)
