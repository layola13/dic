WORD ORIGIN->
The word "nontraitorous" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "traitorous," which derives from the noun "traitor."  "Traitor" comes from the Old French word "traïtor," ultimately from the Latin "traditor," meaning "betrayer" or "one who delivers."  Thus, "nontraitorous" literally means "not betraying."
