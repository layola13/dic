词源:

The word "exciting" is derived from the verb "excite," which comes from the Old French word "exciter," meaning "to rouse, stir up, provoke."  The Old French word itself originates from the Latin word "excitare," a compound of "ex-" (out, from) and "citare" (to call, summon, rouse). Therefore, the core meaning has always revolved around stimulating or arousing something.  The suffix "-ing" transforms the verb into a present participle, functioning as an adjective.
