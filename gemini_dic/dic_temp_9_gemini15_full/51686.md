The word "devilla" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (perhaps a name or place), or a word from a very specific context or dialect.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis as requested.  To provide a proper analysis, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered this term.
