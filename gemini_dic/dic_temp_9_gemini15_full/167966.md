词源:

The word "prioritising" comes from the adjective "prior," meaning "earlier" or "coming before,"  combined with the suffix "-ity" (forming nouns denoting quality, state, or condition) to make "priority," and finally the "-ising" suffix (the present participle form in British English, "-izing" in American English), turning it into a verb meaning "to assign priority to."  The ultimate origin of "prior" is from the Latin word "prior," meaning "former" or "before."
