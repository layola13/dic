词源:
From Old French empescher "to impede, hinder," from em- "in, on" + peschier "to catch, seize," from Late Latin *pedicare "to entrap," from Latin pes, pedis "foot." The original meaning is "to hinder," which evolved to "to accuse" and then to the modern legal sense of "to formally accuse a public official."
