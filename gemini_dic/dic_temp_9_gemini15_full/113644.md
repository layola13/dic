词源:

The word "machine-gunning" is derived from "machine gun" + "-ing" (present participle suffix).  "Machine gun" itself is a compound word combining "machine" (a device that performs a task automatically) and "gun" (a firearm).  The "-ing" suffix transforms the noun phrase into a gerund (verb form acting as a noun) or present participle (verb form acting as an adjective or adverb).
