The word "inand" does not exist as a standalone word in standard English.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical explanations as requested.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word, such as "in and" (a prepositional phrase),  "inward," "inbound," or another word entirely.  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word, a word specific to a certain dialect or community, or slang. If this is the case, please provide more context about where you encountered this word.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or place name. Again, more context is needed.

To get a proper response, please clarify the word you intended to use or provide the context in which you saw "inand."
