词源:

The word "petitionarily" is derived from the noun "petition" + the suffix "-arily".

* **Petition:** From Latin *petitio*, meaning "a seeking," "request," or "entreaty."  This ultimately comes from the verb *petere*, meaning "to seek," "strive for," or "attack."

* **-arily:** This suffix is used to form adverbs from adjectives, often indicating manner or quality.  It's related to the suffix "-ly" but is used with words of Latin origin.
