sensor:/ˈsɛnsər/| n. |传感器，感觉器官|A device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment.  Sensors are used in a wide range of applications, from measuring temperature and pressure to detecting light and motion.|例句：The car's sensor detected an obstacle and automatically braked. 这辆车的传感器检测到障碍物并自动刹车。|例句：The human body has many sensors, such as eyes and ears, that allow us to perceive the world. 人体有许多传感器，例如眼睛和耳朵，使我们能够感知世界。|近义词：detector, transducer, receiver|反义词：N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The sensor detects changes in temperature. = 传感器检测温度变化。
This sensor measures the air pressure. = 这个传感器测量气压。

一般过去时:
The sensor detected a problem in the engine. = 传感器检测到发动机出现问题。
The old sensor failed to register the movement. = 旧传感器未能记录运动。

现在完成时:
The sensor has detected a significant increase in radiation levels. = 传感器已检测到辐射水平显着增加。
The system has been malfunctioning since the sensor failed. = 自从传感器故障以来，系统一直出现故障。

过去完成时:
The alarm had already sounded before the sensor registered the danger. = 在传感器记录危险之前，警报已经响起。
The technician had repaired the sensor before the next test. = 技术人员在下次测试前已经修理了传感器。

将来时:
The new sensor will provide more accurate readings. = 新传感器将提供更精确的读数。
This improved sensor will be able to detect even smaller changes. = 这种改进后的传感器将能够检测到更小的变化。

虚拟语气:
If the sensor were more sensitive, it would detect even smaller changes. = 如果传感器更灵敏，它就能检测到更小的变化。
I wish the sensor had been calibrated before the experiment. = 我希望传感器在实验前已经校准过了。

被动语态:
The temperature was detected by the sensor. = 温度由传感器检测到。
The problem was quickly identified by the new sensor. = 新传感器迅速识别出问题。

疑问句:
What type of sensor is being used in this experiment? = 在这个实验中使用的是哪种类型的传感器？
What does this sensor measure? = 这个传感器测量什么？

否定句:
The sensor did not detect any significant changes. = 传感器没有检测到任何重大变化。
The sensor is not working properly. = 传感器工作不正常。
