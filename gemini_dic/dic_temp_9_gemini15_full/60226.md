词源:
The word "effort" comes from the Old French word "efforcier," meaning "to strengthen" or "to fortify."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "ex-fortis," meaning "out of strength" or "from strength."  The modern English meaning evolved from the sense of strength exerted to the result of that exertion – the effort itself.
