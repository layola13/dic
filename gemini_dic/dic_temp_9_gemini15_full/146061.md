The word "overe" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling or provide more context where you encountered this word?

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, a word specific to a particular dialect or community, or slang not yet widely recognized.  More context is needed.

3. **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name or a place name.
