magnetic-dip:/ˌmæɡˈnɛtɪk dɪp/| n. |磁倾角，磁偏角|The angle between the Earth's magnetic field lines and the horizontal plane.  It is also known as magnetic inclination.  The magnetic dip varies with location and is used in geophysical studies. |例句：The magnetic dip was measured at several locations to create a map of the Earth's magnetic field. 磁倾角在几个地点进行测量，以绘制地球磁场的图。

The magnetic dip is zero at the magnetic equator and 90 degrees at the magnetic poles. 磁倾角在磁赤道为零，在磁极为90度。|近义词：magnetic inclination |反义词：无
