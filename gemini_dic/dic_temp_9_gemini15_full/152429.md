USAGE->

一般现在时:
The pawl engages the ratchet wheel. = 棘爪啮合棘轮。
The pawl prevents backward motion. = 棘爪防止反向运动。

一般过去时:
The pawl engaged the ratchet wheel smoothly. = 棘爪平稳地啮合棘轮。
The pawl prevented the wheel from turning back. = 棘爪阻止车轮反转。

现在完成时:
The pawl has engaged the ratchet wheel reliably. = 棘爪一直可靠地啮合棘轮。
The pawl has prevented any backward movement. = 棘爪阻止了任何反向运动。

过去完成时:
The pawl had already engaged the ratchet before the mechanism started. = 机构启动之前，棘爪已经啮合棘轮。
The pawl had prevented the system from malfunctioning. = 棘爪阻止了系统出现故障。

将来时:
The pawl will engage the ratchet when the lever is activated. = 当杠杆被激活时，棘爪将啮合棘轮。
The pawl will prevent any unintended reversal. = 棘爪将防止任何意外的反转。

虚拟语气:
If the pawl were stronger, it would hold better. = 如果棘爪更坚固，它就能更好地固定。
I wish the pawl hadn't slipped. = 我真希望棘爪没有滑脱。

被动语态:
The ratchet wheel is engaged by the pawl. = 棘轮由棘爪啮合。
The backward motion is prevented by the pawl. = 反向运动由棘爪阻止。

疑问句:
Is the pawl properly engaged? = 棘爪是否正确啮合？
Does the pawl prevent slippage? = 棘爪能防止滑移吗？

否定句:
The pawl didn't engage properly. = 棘爪没有正确啮合。
The pawl didn't prevent the mechanism from reversing. = 棘爪没有阻止机构反转。
