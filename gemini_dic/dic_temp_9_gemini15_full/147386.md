USAGE->
This word is primarily used in chemistry and related fields, not in everyday conversation. Therefore, grammatical tense variations are less relevant than in words with broader usage.  The focus should be on understanding its application within scientific contexts.

Example sentences demonstrating its use in different contexts:

Passive Voice:
The sample was found to be overneutralized, indicating an error in the titration process. 样本被发现过度中和，表明滴定过程中存在错误。

Active Voice:
The researcher overneutralized the solution by adding too much base. 研究人员通过添加过多的碱使溶液过度中和。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "overneutralized". The word's technical nature limits its use in phrasal combinations.  Instead, related terms could be used in phrases like:

"excessive base addition"  过量碱添加
"alkaline beyond neutrality"  超过中性的碱性
"pH above 7" pH值高于7
"unintentional over-neutralization"  意外的过度中和
"correcting overneutralization"  纠正过度中和
