词源:  The word "headspace" is a compound word.  "Head" refers to the head, and "space" refers to an area or volume.  The combination suggests the space within the head, both physically and metaphorically, occupied by thoughts and feelings, or the space above something.  Its usage in the context of container volume is a more recent and literal interpretation.
