词源：

The word "legitimizers" is derived from the verb "legitimize," which itself comes from the Late Latin word "legitimare," meaning "to declare lawful" or "to make legitimate."  "Legitimare" is composed of "legitim-" (from "legitimus," meaning "lawful") and the suffix "-are," indicating an action or process.  The "-izers" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, denoting those who perform the action of legitimizing.
