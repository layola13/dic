USAGE->

This word is primarily used as an adjective, and therefore doesn't follow typical verb conjugations like the example word "what".  It describes a characteristic (equal mean winter temperature), not an action.  Therefore, examples of tense, mood, and voice are not applicable.


PHRASE->

There are no common idiomatic phrases using "isocheimic".  Its use is highly specific to geographical and climatological contexts.
