词源:
The origin of "mumbo-jumbo" is uncertain but likely comes from African languages.  Some theories suggest it may be related to terms for fetish objects or ritualistic practices in West African cultures.  Its use in English emerged in the 18th century, initially referring to idols or fetishes, and later evolved to its current meaning of nonsensical talk.
