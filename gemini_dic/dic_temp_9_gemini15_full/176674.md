USAGE->  This word is so rarely used that providing grammatical examples across tenses is impractical and would be misleading.  The usage mirrors that of  "acknowledgment" but emphasizes repetition.

PHRASE->  There are no established phrases specifically using "reacknowledgement's".  The phrasing would be awkward and unnatural in common usage.  Instead, consider using phrases like:

* repeated acknowledgment of:  重复承认…
* renewed confirmation of:  再次确认…
* further recognition of: 进一步认可…
* second affirmation of:  第二次肯定…
* reiterated thanks for:  再次感谢…

WORD ORIGIN:

The word is formed by combining:

* **re-**: a prefix meaning "again" or "back"
* **acknowledge**:  from Old French *connoistre* "to know," from Latin *cognoscere* "to get to know, learn," from *co-* "together" + *gnoscere* "to know." The prefix "ac-" is a variant of "ad-" (to), and "-ment" is a suffix forming nouns of action or state.
* **-ment**: a suffix forming nouns of action or state.
* **'s**: possessive suffix, indicating belonging to multiple instances.

Therefore, "reacknowledgement's" means "belonging to multiple acts of acknowledging something again."
