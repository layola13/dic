exothecium:/ˌɛksoʊˈθiːʃiəm/| n. |外层组织；（苔藓植物孢子囊的）外壁|The exothecium is the outermost layer of the anther wall in flowering plants, composed of specialized cells that play a crucial role in pollen dispersal.  It is typically composed of fibrous cells that thicken and contract during anther dehiscence, causing the anther to split open and release pollen. |The exothecium of this plant species is particularly robust. = 这种植物的表皮组织特别坚固。  The exothecium plays a critical role in pollen release. = 外层组织在花粉释放中起着至关重要的作用。|endothecium|endothecium
