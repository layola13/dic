lichenization:/ˌlaɪkənɪˈzeɪʃən/| n. |地衣化；地衣形成|The process by which a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium live together in a symbiotic relationship to form a lichen.  This involves the fungus enveloping the alga or cyanobacterium and providing it with protection and nutrients while the alga or cyanobacterium provides the fungus with carbohydrates through photosynthesis. | Example: The lichenization of the rock surface was a slow but fascinating process.  地表的地衣化是一个缓慢但引人入胜的过程。|近义词：symbiosis (in the context of lichen formation)|反义词：None specifically, but the opposite would be the separation of the fungal and algal components of a lichen. |名词
