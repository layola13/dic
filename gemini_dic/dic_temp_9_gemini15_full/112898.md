词源:  The word "ludicrous" ultimately derives from the Latin word "ludicrus," which means "playful" or "sporting."  Over time, its meaning shifted to describe something that is so absurd or outlandish that it becomes laughable or ridiculous.  The change in meaning reflects a transition from something simply playful to something so excessive in its playfulness that it becomes absurd.
