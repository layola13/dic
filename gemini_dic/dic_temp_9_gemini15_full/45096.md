词源:
The word "cuckolding" originates from the Old French word "cucul", meaning "cuckoo".  The cuckoo bird is known for its habit of laying its eggs in other birds' nests, thus raising its young at the expense of another.  This parasitic behavior became a metaphor for a husband whose wife is unfaithful, with the implication that he is unknowingly raising another man's child.  The term "cuckold" then evolved, and the verb form "cucking" followed.
