PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "hunchbacks" as it's primarily a noun describing a physical condition.  Using it in a phrase would generally be considered insensitive.  Instead, more appropriate phrases might focus on the condition itself (e.g., "suffering from kyphosis," "having spinal curvature").
