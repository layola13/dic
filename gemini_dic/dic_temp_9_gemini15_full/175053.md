radioli:/reɪˈdiːoʊlaɪ/ | n. |放射状骨针；放射骨；棘状突起 |  Plural of radiole.  Slender, radiating spines or spicules, especially those found on echinoderms (such as sea urchins and starfish) and some other invertebrates.  They are often used for defense, locomotion, or feeding. | The sea urchin's radioles protected it from predators. |近义词：spines, spicules |反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The sea urchin uses its radioles for defense. = 海胆用它的放射状骨针进行防御。
These radioles are delicate and easily broken. = 这些放射状骨针很脆弱，很容易断裂。


一般过去时:
The paleontologist examined the fossil's radioles carefully. = 古生物学家仔细检查了化石的放射状骨针。
The radioles of this species were longer than those of other species. = 这个物种的放射状骨针比其他物种的要长。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the radioles of many different echinoderm species. = 科学家们已经研究了许多不同棘皮动物物种的放射状骨针。
Researchers have discovered new information about the function of these radioles. = 研究人员发现了关于这些放射状骨针功能的新信息。


过去完成时:
Before the attack, the sea urchin had retracted its radioles. = 在攻击之前，海胆已经收回了它的放射状骨针。
The fossil's radioles had been damaged before it was discovered. = 这块化石的放射状骨针在被发现之前就已经受损了。


将来时:
We will analyze the radioles under a microscope. = 我们将在显微镜下分析这些放射状骨针。
Scientists will continue to study the evolution of radioles in echinoderms. = 科学家们将继续研究棘皮动物中放射状骨针的进化。


虚拟语气:
If the radioles were longer, the sea urchin would be better protected. = 如果放射状骨针更长，海胆将得到更好的保护。
I wish I had a better understanding of the function of these radioles. = 我希望我对这些放射状骨针的功能有更好的理解。


被动语态:
The radioles were carefully examined by the researchers. = 这些放射状骨针被研究人员仔细检查了。
The radioles' structure is being studied using advanced imaging techniques. = 正在使用先进的成像技术研究放射状骨针的结构。


疑问句:
What is the function of these radioles? = 这些放射状骨针的功能是什么？
How many radioles does this sea urchin have? = 这个海胆有多少个放射状骨针？


否定句:
The sea star did not have many radioles. = 这颗海星没有很多放射状骨针。
This species of sea urchin lacks prominent radioles. = 这个物种的海胆缺乏明显的放射状骨针。


PHRASE->
There is no common phrase directly using "radioles".  The word is primarily used in scientific contexts.  However, we can create example phrases based on its meaning:
radiole structure = 放射状骨针结构
radiole arrangement = 放射状骨针排列
radiole development = 放射状骨针发育
radiole function = 放射状骨针功能
radiole morphology = 放射状骨针形态
