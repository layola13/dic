词源:
The word "shammy" comes from the French word "chamois," which refers to a type of goat-antelope whose soft, suede-like skin was traditionally used for cleaning and polishing.  The use of chamois leather for cleaning spread throughout Europe and eventually to English-speaking countries, with the word evolving into "shammy."
