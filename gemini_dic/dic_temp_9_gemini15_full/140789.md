The word "omy" is not a standalone word in standard English.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a full lexical entry following the requested format.  "Omy" might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  It could be a typo of another word, such as "only," "omygod" (a slang variation of "oh my god"), or a proper noun.  Without context, it's impossible to determine the intended word.

2. **Part of a larger word:** It might be a fragment of a longer word, such as "economy" or "taxonomy."

3. **A neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word or slang term specific to a certain community or context.


To provide an analysis, I need more context. Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the sentence or phrase where "omy" appears would help determine its meaning and allow for a proper analysis.
