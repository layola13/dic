近义词：dissatisfaction, discontent, unrest, disgruntlement, unease, foreboding (of discontent)

反义词：contentment, satisfaction, peace, tranquility


词源:  The word is a combination of "pre-" (before, beforehand), "dis-" (not, opposite of), "content" (satisfied, pleased), and "-ment" (a noun suffix indicating a state or condition).  Therefore, it literally means "a state of being not yet content," or "a state of being beforehand not content".  It's a relatively rare and somewhat literary word.
