The word "{dakokuya}" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a transliteration of a Japanese word.  Therefore, a standard English word analysis cannot be provided.  To provide the requested analysis, I need the Japanese word and its meaning.  Then I can provide a transliteration, pronunciation in IPA, word class, definition, examples, and other requested information based on the Japanese word's properties.
