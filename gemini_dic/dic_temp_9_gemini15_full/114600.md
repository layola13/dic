/ˈmeɪlbrænˌtʃɪzəm/| n. |男性沙文主义；大男子主义|Malebrancheism refers to the philosophical system of Nicolas Malebranche, characterized by its emphasis on occasionalism, the view that God is the sole cause of events in the world, and that created things only act as occasions for God's action.  It is often associated with a strong emphasis on intellectual intuition and a rejection of empiricism. However, in modern usage, the term is often mistakenly used to describe male chauvinism or sexism.  The connection is tenuous at best and stems from a misunderstanding or misapplication of the term.|The true meaning of Malebrancheism is rarely understood today; instead, people often wrongly conflate it with male chauvinism.|近义词(for the philosophical meaning): Occasionalism|反义词(for the philosophical meaning): Empiricism, Materialism|
