词源:
The origin of "honky-tonk" is uncertain, but it's believed to have emerged in the early 20th century in the Southern United States.  Several theories exist, including one suggesting it derives from the sound of a poorly tuned piano, and another linking it to "honky," a slang term for a black person (though this connection is considered offensive and outdated).  The term eventually came to describe the bars where this music was played.
