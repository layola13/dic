词源:  Derived from the adjective "frugal" (meaning economical in use or expenditure; sparing or scanty), which itself comes from the Middle English word "frugal," ultimately from the Latin word "frugi" meaning "fruitful, useful, thrifty".  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, indicating a state or quality.
