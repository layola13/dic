词源:
The word "revel" ultimately derives from the Old French word "reveiller," meaning "to awaken" or "to rouse."  Over time, its meaning shifted, influenced by the related word "revelation," to encompass the sense of lively celebration and the uncovering of secrets.  The modern meaning is a blend of these historical senses.
