phasemeter:/ˈfeɪzmiːtər/ | n. | 相位计 | A phasemeter is an instrument used to measure the phase difference between two alternating current (AC) waveforms of the same frequency.  It is commonly used in electrical engineering and electronics to analyze and troubleshoot AC circuits.  | Example: The engineer used a phasemeter to check the phase relationship between the voltage and current in the motor.  工程师用相位计检查电机中电压和电流的相位关系。 | 近义词：phase angle meter | 反义词：无
