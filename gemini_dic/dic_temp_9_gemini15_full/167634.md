/ˈpraɪəpɪst/| n.| 崇拜男性生殖器的| A priapist is a person who has an obsessive interest in or preoccupation with penises, often manifested in sexual arousal or fetishism. The term is derived from Priapus, the Greek god of fertility and male genitalia, who was often depicted with a large, erect phallus.  The term can be used clinically to describe a person with priapism (a persistent, usually painful erection), but it is more commonly used in a broader, often pejorative, sense to describe someone with an unhealthy obsession with penises. | The artist's work was criticized for its overt priapism.  The patient presented with priapism, requiring immediate medical attention. |  (近义词缺乏直接对应词，可根据语境选择类似含义的词，例如:phallic worshipper, penis fetishist) | (反义词缺乏直接对应词，可考虑与“对男性生殖器缺乏兴趣”相关的词，例如：ascetic, puritan) | 名词
