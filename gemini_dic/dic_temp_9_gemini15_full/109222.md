The word "leing" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a word from a very specific context (e.g., slang, jargon, a proper noun).  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested in the format.  To help me assist you, please double-check the spelling or provide more context about where you encountered this word.
