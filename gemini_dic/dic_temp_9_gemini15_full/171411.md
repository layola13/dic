词源:
The word "puddle" comes from the Middle English word "puddel," which likely originated from an Old French word, possibly related to the Old French word "poule" meaning "hen," referring to the way a puddle might spread out like a hen's feathers.  Another possible source is the Old English word "pyttel," meaning a small pit.  The exact etymology is uncertain.
