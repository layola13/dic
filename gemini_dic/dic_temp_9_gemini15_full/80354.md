词源:
The word "goldplated" is a compound word.  "Gold" refers to the precious metal, and "plated" means covered with a thin layer of a metal. The term thus literally describes an object covered with a thin layer of gold.  Figuratively, it describes something that appears impressive or valuable but lacks substance.
