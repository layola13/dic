Word Origin (Etymology):  The word "leuke" is derived from the Middle Dutch word "luik," meaning "opening," "gap," or "hole."  This original meaning evolved over time, possibly through associations with things that are "open" and inviting, eventually leading to its modern meaning of "pleasant" or "nice." The transition in meaning is not fully straightforward and is subject to ongoing linguistic research.


Note:  Because "leuke" is an adjective,  the English grammatical structures and tense examples provided in your template are not applicable.  The word's usage depends entirely on the context within a Dutch sentence.  I cannot provide English language tense examples for a Dutch word.
