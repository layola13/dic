pseudoprosperously: /ˌsuːdəʊˈprɒspərəsli/ | adj. |表面繁荣地，虚假繁荣地 | seeming prosperous, but actually not so; falsely prosperous.  The word suggests a superficial or deceptive appearance of wealth and success.

英文解析: The word is formed from "pseudo" (false, seeming) + "prosperously" (in a prosperous manner). It describes a situation where outward appearances suggest wealth and success, but the reality is quite different. There might be underlying financial instability, social issues, or other problems masked by a facade of prosperity.
