/ˌoʊvərɪntərˈfɪrənsɪz/ | n. |过度干扰；过多的干扰 | Excessive interference; too much interference.  This word is not a standard English word and lacks established usage in dictionaries or corpora. It's likely a newly coined word or a misspelling.  Therefore, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage is not possible.  The word is formed by combining "over" (meaning excessively) and "interferences" (plural of interference).

The root "inter-" comes from Latin "inter," meaning "between" or "among."  "Fer" is from Latin "ferre," meaning "to carry" or "to bear." Thus, "interference" originally implied something carried or brought between, leading to its current meaning of obstruction or disruption.  "Over" is a common English prefix indicating excess or above a certain limit.

Therefore, "overinterferences" suggests a situation with an excessive amount of interference.  However, due to its non-standard nature, it's advisable to use more established alternatives like "excessive interference," "too much interference," or "overwhelming interference" in formal writing or speech.
