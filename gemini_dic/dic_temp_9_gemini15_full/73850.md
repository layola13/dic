词源:

The word "formulaic" is derived from the noun "formula," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "formula," meaning "a rule, form, or model."  The suffix "-ic" is added to create an adjective, meaning "relating to" or "characterized by."  Therefore, "formulaic" describes something that adheres strictly to a formula or established pattern.
