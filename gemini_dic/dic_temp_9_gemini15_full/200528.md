词源:

The word "slaphead" is a compound word.  "Slap" in this context refers to the flat, smooth surface of a bald head, similar to the sound and impact of a slap.  "Head" simply refers to the head.  The combination creates a descriptive but informal and potentially offensive term.  There's no single definitive etymological source tracing it back to a specific historical moment or text, but it's clearly a colloquialism arising from the descriptive nature of the imagery.
