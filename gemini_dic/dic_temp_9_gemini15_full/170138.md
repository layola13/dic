protofilament: /ˌproʊtoʊˈfɪləmənt/ | n. | 原丝 | A protofilament is a linear array of protein molecules, typically forming part of a larger structure like a microtubule or intermediate filament.  These filaments are fundamental building blocks of the cytoskeleton in many cells. They are often composed of repeating subunits that assemble in a head-to-tail manner.  The arrangement and interaction of protofilaments determine the overall structure and properties of the larger filament. | Example: The microtubules are composed of thirteen protofilaments arranged in a cylindrical structure.  微管由十三条以圆柱形结构排列的原丝组成。 | 近义词: filament, fiber, strand | 反义词:  N/A
