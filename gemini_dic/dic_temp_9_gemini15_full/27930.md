cantilever:/ˈkæntilˌiːvər/ | n. |悬臂，悬臂梁 | A cantilever is a rigid structural element, such as a beam or a plate, that extends horizontally from a single support point.  It is designed to withstand loads applied to its free end.  The term often refers to projecting structures like balconies or bridges. |Example: The bridge's design incorporated a series of cantilevers to span the wide river.  这座桥的设计包含一系列悬臂以跨越宽阔的河流。|近义词：overhang, bracket |反义词： N/A


USAGE->

词源:
The word "cantilever" ultimately derives from the Old French word  "cantilever," meaning "to overhang."  The word entered English in the 19th century, coinciding with advancements in structural engineering.
