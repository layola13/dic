The word "hard's" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a non-standard contraction.  There's no entry for it in standard dictionaries.  To provide an analysis, we need to consider what the intended word might be.  It could be a few possibilities, each requiring a separate analysis:


**Possibility 1:  Contraction of "hard is"**

/hɑːrdz/ | adj. + v. | 坚硬的是 |  This is a grammatically incorrect contraction. While contractions like "it's" (it is) are common, "hard's" isn't.  It would be grammatically correct to use "hard is" instead.


**Example:** Incorrect: "The rock's hard's."  Correct: "The rock is hard."  (岩石很硬。)


**Possibility 2: Possessive of "hard" (incorrect)**

/hɑːrdz/ | adj. (incorrect possessive form)| 坚硬的（错误所有格形式）| The word "hard" is an adjective, not a noun.  Therefore, it cannot take a possessive form ("hard's").  One would use a different phrasing to express possession.


**Example:** Incorrect: "That's the hard's surface." Correct: "That's the hard surface." (那是坚硬的表面。) or "That's the surface of the hard object." (那是坚硬物体的表面。)



**Possibility 3:  Misspelling of other words**

It could be a misspelling of other words, depending on the context.  Without the context, it's impossible to determine what word was intended.


**In summary:** Because "hard's" is not a valid English word, a full grammatical and usage analysis cannot be provided.  The user should review their spelling and grammar to identify the intended word and then a proper analysis can be given.
