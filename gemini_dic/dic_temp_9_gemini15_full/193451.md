词源:
The word "selcouth" is of Old English origin, deriving from *seolf-cuþ, where "seolf" means "self" and "cuþ" means "known," or more accurately, "well-known," "familiar".  The interesting twist is that over time, the meaning shifted to its opposite.  While originally meaning "familiar," it evolved to mean "unfamiliar" or "strange,"  likely due to the inherent strangeness of something that is "self-known" only to itself, making it mysterious or uncanny to outsiders.
