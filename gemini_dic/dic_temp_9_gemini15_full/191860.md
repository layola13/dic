sclerotome:/ˈsklɪərətoʊm/| n. |  sclerotome (胚胎学)  sclerotome |硬骨母细胞；骨原；脊椎骨节；硬化体|A sclerotome is the part of a somite in a vertebrate embryo that develops into the vertebrae and ribs.  It is formed from the ventromedial portion of the somite and is characterized by its mesenchymal cells. These cells differentiate into chondrocytes, which then form cartilage, and subsequently bone.  The sclerotomes contribute significantly to the axial skeleton's formation.| The sclerotomes of the developing embryo fuse to form the vertebrae. = 发育中的胚胎的硬骨母细胞融合形成椎骨。|近义词：somite (partially), vertebra precursor |反义词：dermatome (in the context of somite components)


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The sclerotome forms the vertebrae. = 硬骨母细胞形成椎骨。
Sclerotomes differentiate into chondrocytes. = 硬骨母细胞分化为软骨细胞。

一般过去时:
The sclerotome contributed to the axial skeleton. = 硬骨母细胞促成了轴向骨骼的形成。
Scientists studied the sclerotome's development. = 科学家研究了硬骨母细胞的发育。

现在完成时:
Researchers have identified genes involved in sclerotome development. = 研究人员已经发现了参与硬骨母细胞发育的基因。
The sclerotome has played a crucial role in vertebrate evolution. = 硬骨母细胞在脊椎动物进化中发挥了至关重要的作用。

过去完成时:
Before the fusion, the sclerotomes had migrated. = 在融合之前，硬骨母细胞已经迁移了。
The experiment had shown the sclerotome's differentiation process. = 实验已经显示了硬骨母细胞的分化过程。

将来时:
Scientists will further investigate sclerotome formation. = 科学家将进一步研究硬骨母细胞的形成。
This research will contribute to understanding sclerotome development. = 这项研究将有助于理解硬骨母细胞的发育。


虚拟语气:
If the sclerotome failed to develop, the vertebrae would be malformed. = 如果硬骨母细胞发育失败，椎骨就会畸形。
It is crucial that the sclerotome develops correctly. = 硬骨母细胞正确发育至关重要。

被动语态:

疑问句:
What is the role of the sclerotome in bone formation? = 硬骨母细胞在骨骼形成中的作用是什么？
How do sclerotomes differentiate into chondrocytes? = 硬骨母细胞如何分化为软骨细胞？

否定句:
The sclerotome does not directly form the ribs. = 硬骨母细胞不直接形成肋骨。(Note: While contributing to the rib cage's structure, it's not the sole contributor.)
The study did not find any significant differences in sclerotome development. = 该研究没有发现硬骨母细胞发育的任何显著差异。


PHRASE->
