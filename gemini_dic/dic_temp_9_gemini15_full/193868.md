词源:
The word "self-disdain" is a compound word.  "Self" is an Old English word meaning "own," "same," or "very."  "Disdain" comes from the Old French word "desdain," which ultimately derives from the Latin "dis-" (away, apart) and "dignari" (to deem worthy).  Therefore, "self-disdain" literally means "to deem oneself unworthy" or "to hold oneself in contempt."
