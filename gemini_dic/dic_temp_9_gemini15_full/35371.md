词源:

* **co-**:  prefix meaning "together" or "jointly".  Derived from Latin "com-" (meaning "with" or "together").

* **obligant**:  This part of the word comes from the verb "to oblige," meaning to bind legally or morally.  It ultimately stems from the Latin word "obligare," which means "to bind."  The "-ant" suffix denotes an agent or doer of the action.
