2. **If "pretempted" was meant to be a combination of "pre-" and another word:**

This requires more information about the context where you encountered "pretempted."  The prefix "pre-" means "before" or "in advance."  We'd need the rest of the word to understand its potential meaning.  For example:

* **Pre-empted:**  (pre-ˈɛmptɪd) | v. | 先发制人，抢先占据 | To take action before someone else does; to prevent something from happening by acting first. | Example: The government pre-empted the crisis by raising interest rates. 政府通过提高利率来预防危机。
