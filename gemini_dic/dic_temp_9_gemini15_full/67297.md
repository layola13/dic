exsolution:/ˌɛkˈsɒljuːʃən/| n. |溶离，析离|The process by which a homogeneous solid solution separates into two or more distinct phases upon cooling or other changes in conditions.  This often occurs in minerals and alloys. |例句：The exsolution of plagioclase feldspar from a previously homogeneous melt is a common geological process. 辉长岩从先前均匀的熔体中溶离斜长石长石是一个常见的地球化学过程。


The exsolution textures in this rock sample indicate a complex cooling history.  这个岩石样品中的溶离结构表明了一个复杂的冷却历史。|近义词：separation, unmixing |反义词：solution, homogenization
