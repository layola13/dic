词源:
The word "perceivingness" is derived from the verb "perceive,"  which comes from the Old French word "perceivre" and ultimately from the Latin "percipere," meaning "to seize, grasp, take hold of." The suffix "-ingness" adds the meaning of "the quality or state of being."  Therefore, "perceivingness" literally means "the quality or state of being able to perceive."
