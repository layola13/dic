neanderthaloids: /ˌniːændərˈθɔɪdz/ | n. |尼安德特人样的人；具有尼安德特人特征的人|

英文解析:The term "neanderthaloids" refers to individuals or populations exhibiting physical characteristics reminiscent of Neanderthals, an extinct species of archaic humans. These characteristics might include a robust build, prominent brow ridges, a receding chin, and a larger cranial capacity compared to modern humans.  The term is often used in anthropological and paleoanthropological contexts, although its precise definition and usage can be debated due to the complexities of human evolution and the diversity within Neanderthal populations.  It's important to note that the term doesn't imply a direct lineal descent from Neanderthals but rather a shared set of phenotypic traits.
