用法说明:

`noncomprehensibly` is an adverb that modifies a verb, describing how an action was performed in an incomprehensible manner.  It emphasizes the lack of understanding associated with the action.  There is no specific grammatical tense associated with it, as it simply describes the manner of an action in any tense.  Because it's an adverb, it can be placed in various positions within a sentence to modify the verb.

由于`noncomprehensibly`本身是一个副词，它并不像动词那样有各种时态变化。它只修饰动词，说明动作是如何以一种难以理解的方式进行的。


注意：由于该词描述的是一种状态，因此不适用一般现在时、一般过去时等时态的例句说明。
