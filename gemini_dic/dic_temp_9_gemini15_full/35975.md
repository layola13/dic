The word "coden" is not a standard English word. There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a technical term from a specific field, or a newly coined word.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer a more informed response.
