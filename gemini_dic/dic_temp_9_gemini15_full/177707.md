词性：名词


词源：源自拉丁语 *re- (表示“再次”)+ cantare (“to sing”)。最初指再次吟唱，后引申为重复或重复声明，最终演变为放弃先前观点或信仰的公开声明。  The word's etymology traces back to the Latin "recantare," meaning "to sing again," suggesting a repeated singing, perhaps of a changed or revised version of a song or statement. This evolved into a meaning of publicly withdrawing a statement or belief.
