反义词: intraparochial (within a single parish)


词源:
* **inter-**:  A prefix meaning "between" or "among".
* **parochial**: Relating to a parish (a church district and its associated community).  This ultimately derives from the Greek word *paroikia* (παροικία), meaning "dwelling beside," "residence," or "a temporary abode."  In the context of Christianity, it came to mean a community under the pastoral care of a single priest.
* **-ly**: An adverbial suffix.


USAGE->  (Since *interparochially* is an adverb, verb tenses don't directly apply to it.  It modifies verbs, describing how an action is performed.)
