词源:
The word "disoblige" is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the verb "oblige," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "obligare," meaning "to bind."  Therefore, "disoblige" literally means "to unbind" or "to not bind," implying a failure to fulfill an obligation or expectation, thus leading to displeasure.
