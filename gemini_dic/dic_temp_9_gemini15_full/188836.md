词源:  The word "rusine" likely derives from the French word for "red" or a related term describing a specific shade of red, although a definitive etymological source is difficult to pinpoint without more context.  It might be a relatively modern coinage, perhaps specific to a certain industry (e.g., paints, textiles) or region.
