词源:
The word "fantasizers" is derived from the verb "fantasize," which itself comes from the noun "fantasy."  "Fantasy" ultimately traces its roots back to the late Middle English word "fantasie," borrowed from the Old French "fantasie" and ultimately from the late Latin "phantasia," meaning "appearance, imagination, fancy."  The "-er" suffix indicates a person who performs the action.
