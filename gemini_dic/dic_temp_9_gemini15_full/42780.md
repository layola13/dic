Coupable is primarily used as an adjective to describe someone or something that is guilty or deserving of blame for a wrongdoing or offense. It implies a degree of moral responsibility or fault.  It is less commonly used in everyday conversation than "guilty," but it is often found in legal or formal contexts.  The word carries a stronger connotation of moral blame than simply "at fault."
