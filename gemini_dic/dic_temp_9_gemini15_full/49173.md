The word "dekkos" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, slang, regional dialect word, or a proper noun (like a name or place).  To provide an analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (book, conversation, online forum, etc.)
* **What was the surrounding text or conversation?** This would help determine the intended meaning.

Without this information, I cannot provide the requested format.
