The word "missupposing" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a nonce word, or a newly coined word used only for a specific occasion or context.  It's likely a blend or misspelling of words like "misunderstanding," "misapprehending," or "supposing."  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is not possible.  To provide a response in the requested format, we would need to analyze what the intended meaning was.  If you can provide context (a sentence where you encountered this word), it would be possible to offer a plausible interpretation and analysis.
