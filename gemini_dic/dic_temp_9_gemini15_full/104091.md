jump-jet: /ˈdʒʌmpdʒet/ | n. |跳跃喷气机，垂直起降飞机 | A jump jet is an aircraft capable of vertical or short takeoff and landing (V/STOL) using jet engines for both vertical lift and horizontal propulsion.  It combines the maneuverability of a helicopter with the speed and range of a conventional jet aircraft. | Example: The Harrier jump jet was a revolutionary aircraft of its time.  跳跃喷气机在其时代是一架革命性的飞机。  The development of jump jets significantly advanced VTOL technology. 跳跃喷气机的研制极大地推动了垂直起降技术的进步。| 近义词：VTOL aircraft, VSTOL aircraft | 反义词：conventional aircraft
