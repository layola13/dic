orientality:/ˌɔːriənˈtæləti/ | n. |东方性；东方特征；东方主义|The term "orientality" refers to a Western style of thought about the East, particularly the Middle East, that is often stereotypical, exoticizing, and based on power imbalances. It encompasses a range of ideas and representations that depict Eastern cultures as mysterious, sensual, backward, or exotic, often contrasting them with the perceived rationality and modernity of the West.  The concept is often used to critique the way Western societies have historically viewed and represented the East.|  Edward Said's book *Orientalism* is a seminal work that explores the concept in detail.  His analysis critiques the way Western scholarship and art have constructed a "stereotypical Orient," perpetuating power dynamics and justifying colonialism. |近义词：exoticism, otherness|反义词：Westernness
