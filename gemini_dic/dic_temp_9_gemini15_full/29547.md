The word "catchen" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant "catch," "cachen" (a less common variant of "cache"), or another word entirely. Please double-check your spelling.

2. **A dialectal word:** It might be a word used in a specific region or community, but not widely known.

3. **A newly coined word:**  It could be a newly invented word, a neologism.


If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, the sentence it was used in), I might be able to offer a more accurate analysis.  Otherwise, I cannot provide the requested information following the specified format.
