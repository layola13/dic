词源:  The word "mews" ultimately derives from the Old French word "mue," meaning "molting place" or "place where birds molt."  This is because mews were originally used to house royal falcons and other birds of prey, which required sheltered areas for molting. Over time, the word shifted to refer to the stables themselves and eventually the narrow passages behind buildings.
