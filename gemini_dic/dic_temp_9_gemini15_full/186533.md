rictuses:/ˈrɪktəsəz/| n. |裂嘴笑，露齿而笑 |A rictus is a grimace or a forced, unnatural smile, often revealing the teeth. It typically expresses something other than genuine happiness, such as pain, fear, or malice.  The term often implies a distorted or grotesque expression. |例句：His face contorted into a rictus of pain. 他痛苦地咧着嘴。

The villain's rictus revealed his wicked intentions. 反派的裂嘴笑暴露了他的邪恶意图。|近义词：grin, smirk, grimace, sneer |反义词：smile (genuine), beam

词源:  From Latin *rictus, meaning "gaping mouth," "chasm," or "opening."  The word's connection to the action of opening the mouth widely is evident in its modern usage.  The transition from a simple description of a wide-open mouth to the connotation of a forced or unnatural smile is a semantic shift reflecting the interpretation of such an expression.
