词源:
The word "resonate" comes from the Latin word "resonare," meaning "to sound again" or "to re-sound."  It combines the prefix "re-" (again) and the verb "sonare" (to sound). The original meaning related to the physical phenomenon of sound echoing or reverberating.  The figurative meaning, referring to emotional or intellectual connection, developed later.
