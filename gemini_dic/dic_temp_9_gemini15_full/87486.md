hetero-agglutination:/ˌhɛtərəʊˌæɡljuːtɪˈneɪʃən/| n. |异种凝集|The clumping together of cells from different species or individuals due to the interaction of antibodies or other agglutinins with surface antigens.| Example: Hetero-agglutination is often observed in blood transfusion reactions involving incompatible blood types. 异种凝集反应通常在涉及不相容血型的输血反应中观察到。|近义词: cross-agglutination |反义词: autoagglutination


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Hetero-agglutination occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on cells from different species. = 当抗体与来自不同物种的细胞上的抗原结合时，就会发生异种凝集反应。

现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several factors influencing hetero-agglutination. = 研究人员已经确定了几个影响异种凝集的因素。
Scientists have used hetero-agglutination in various diagnostic tests. = 科学家已将异种凝集用于各种诊断测试。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the mechanism of hetero-agglutination was unclear. = 在发现之前，异种凝集的机制尚不清楚。
They had already observed hetero-agglutination in previous experiments. = 他们之前在实验中已经观察到异种凝集反应。


将来时:
Future research will focus on the applications of hetero-agglutination. = 未来的研究将集中在异种凝集的应用上。
Scientists will investigate the role of specific proteins in hetero-agglutination. = 科学家将研究特定蛋白质在异种凝集中的作用。


虚拟语气:
If the blood types were compatible, hetero-agglutination would not have occurred. = 如果血型相容，就不会发生异种凝集反应。
It would be helpful if we understood the precise mechanism of hetero-agglutination. = 如果我们理解异种凝集的确切机制，将会有所帮助。


被动语态:
Hetero-agglutination was observed in the sample. = 在样品中观察到异种凝集反应。
The reaction is characterized by hetero-agglutination. = 该反应的特点是异种凝集。


疑问句:
Does hetero-agglutination always indicate an incompatibility? = 异种凝集反应是否总是表明不相容？
What factors contribute to hetero-agglutination? = 哪些因素导致异种凝集？


否定句:
Hetero-agglutination did not occur in the control group. = 对照组没有发生异种凝集反应。
The absence of hetero-agglutination suggests compatibility. = 异种凝集反应的缺失表明相容性。
