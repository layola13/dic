crossopterygian:/ˌkrɒsɒpˈtɛəriːdʒən/| adj. | 腔棘鱼类的；| relating to or characteristic of the Crossopterygii, an order of lobe-finned fishes including the coelacanth.  These fishes are characterized by their fleshy, lobed fins, which are considered to be homologous to the limbs of tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates).| The discovery of living coelacanths revolutionized our understanding of crossopterygian evolution.  腔棘鱼的发现彻底改变了我们对腔棘鱼类进化的理解。|近义词：lobe-finned (in the context of fish)|反义词：N/A
