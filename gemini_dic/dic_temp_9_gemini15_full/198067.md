词源:
The term "shoey" is a blend of "shoe" and "ey," the latter likely functioning as a suffix to create a noun similar to other action nouns ending in "-ey" (e.g., "smiley"). Its origin is uncertain, but it gained significant popularity in recent years, particularly associated with Australian sporting culture.
