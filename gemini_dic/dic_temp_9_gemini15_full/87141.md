The word "herberwe" is not a recognized word in standard English.  It's likely a misspelling, a word from a dialect, or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  To assist you, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered this term.
