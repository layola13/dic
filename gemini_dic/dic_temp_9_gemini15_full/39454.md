词源:
The word "connectorized" is derived from the noun "connector" and the suffix "-ized," which indicates the process of being made or converted into something.  "Connector" itself comes from "connect" (to join or link) + "-or" (agent suffix).  Therefore, "connectorized" means "made ready for connection" or "having been equipped with connectors".
