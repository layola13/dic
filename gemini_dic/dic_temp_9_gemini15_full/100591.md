词源:
The word "inthrallment" comes from the verb "inthrall," which itself is a variant spelling of "inthrall."  "Inthrall"  originates from the Old English "þræl" meaning "slave" or "bondman."  The prefix "in-" indicates a state of being. Therefore, "inthrallment" originally signified the state of being enslaved or bound, but its meaning has evolved to encompass a more positive sense of captivating fascination.
