词源:  Derived from the word "petty," meaning small, insignificant, or mean. The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "petty" into the noun "pettiness," indicating a quality or state of being petty. The further addition of "-es" creates the plural form, "pettinesses," referring to multiple instances of pettiness.  The word "petty" itself has roots in Old French "petit" (small) and ultimately from the Latin "petty" (small).
