The word "counterirritation" is a compound word.  "Counter" means "against" or "opposite," and "irritation" refers to the stimulation of the skin or tissues, often causing discomfort.  Therefore, counterirritation literally means "irritation against irritation," referring to the process of using irritation in one area to alleviate irritation or pain in another.
