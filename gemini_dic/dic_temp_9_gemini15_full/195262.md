词源:

The word "semifluid" is a combination of the prefix "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partly") and the noun "fluid" (meaning "a substance that can flow easily").  The term thus describes a substance possessing some, but not all, the properties of a fluid.  It reflects the Latin origin of "fluid"  (from *fluere*, "to flow").
