词源:  The adverb "defiantly" derives from the adjective "defiant," which ultimately comes from the verb "defy."  "Defy" comes from the Old French "defier," meaning "to challenge," "to distrust," or "to refuse."  This in turn has roots in the Latin prefix "de-" (meaning "down," "away," or "off") and "fidere" (meaning "to trust").  Thus, "defy" originally meant to "lack trust in," which evolved into the modern sense of openly resisting or challenging authority.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective "defiant" into the adverb "defiantly," indicating the manner in which an action is performed.
