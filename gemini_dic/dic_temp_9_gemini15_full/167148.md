presystole:/ˌpriːˈsɪstoʊliː/| n. |心房收缩期|The period of contraction of the atria of the heart, immediately before the ventricles contract.  It's the final phase of diastole and precedes systole. | Example:  The electrocardiogram showed a prolonged presystole. 心电图显示心房收缩期延长。|近义词: atrial contraction, atrial systole (less precise)|反义词: systole

一般现在时:
The presystole is a crucial phase in the cardiac cycle. = 心房收缩期是心脏周期中的一个关键阶段。
Doctors monitor the presystole to assess heart health. = 医生监测心房收缩期以评估心脏健康。


一般过去时:
The patient's presystole was abnormally short. = 病人的心房收缩期异常短。
We observed a delayed presystole during the examination. = 我们在检查中观察到心房收缩期延迟。


现在完成时:
Researchers have studied the presystole extensively. = 研究人员已经广泛研究了心房收缩期。

The doctor had already noticed the irregularities in the patient's presystole. = 医生已经注意到病人心房收缩期的异常。


将来时:
Future studies will investigate the role of presystole in heart failure. = 未来的研究将调查心房收缩期在心力衰竭中的作用。
We will analyze the presystole data to identify potential risk factors. = 我们将分析心房收缩期数据以识别潜在的危险因素。


虚拟语气:
If the presystole were longer, it might indicate a problem. = 如果心房收缩期更长，这可能表明存在问题。
It would be beneficial if we could better understand the mechanisms of presystole. = 如果我们能够更好地理解心房收缩期的机制，那将是有益的。


被动语态:
The presystole is often measured using electrocardiography. = 心房收缩期通常使用心电图测量。

否定句:
The patient did not exhibit any abnormalities in their presystole. = 病人没有表现出心房收缩期的任何异常。
There were no significant changes observed in the presystole during the treatment. = 在治疗期间没有观察到心房收缩期的任何显著变化。


PHRASE->
prolonged presystole = 心房收缩期延长
abnormal presystole = 心房收缩期异常
shortened presystole = 心房收缩期缩短
presystole dysfunction = 心房收缩期功能障碍
measurement of presystole = 心房收缩期的测量
