词源:
The word "coexecutors" is a compound word.  "Co-" is a prefix meaning "together" or "jointly," derived from Latin "com-" (together). "Executors" is the plural of "executor," which comes from the Latin "executor," meaning "one who carries out," from "ex-" (out) and "sequi" (to follow).  Therefore, "coexecutors" literally means "those who carry out together."
