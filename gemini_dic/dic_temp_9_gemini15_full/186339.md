rhumb:/rʌm/| n.| 罗盘方位线，恒向线 | A rhumb line, also called a loxodrome, is a line on the surface of the sphere that crosses all meridians of longitude at the same angle.  It is a path of constant bearing, meaning that if you were to follow a rhumb line, you would always be traveling in the same compass direction. Unlike a great circle, a rhumb line is not the shortest distance between two points, but it is easier to navigate. | The ship sailed on a rhumb line to its destination. 这艘船沿着罗盘方位线航行到目的地。|近义词：loxodrome|反义词：great circle


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The ship follows a rhumb line. = 这艘船沿着恒向线航行。
A rhumb line crosses all meridians at the same angle. = 恒向线与所有经线相交的角度相同。


一般过去时:
The navigator plotted a course along a rhumb line. = 导航员沿恒向线规划了一条航线。
They sailed on a rhumb line for days. = 他们沿着恒向线航行了数天。


现在完成时:
The sailors have navigated using rhumb lines for centuries. = 水手们几个世纪以来一直使用恒向线进行导航。
We have successfully plotted the course using a rhumb line. = 我们已经成功地使用恒向线规划了航线。


过去完成时:
The captain had already calculated the rhumb line course before departure. = 船长在出发前就已经计算出了恒向线航线。
They had followed the rhumb line for many miles. = 他们沿着恒向线航行了许多英里。


将来时:
We will use a rhumb line for this leg of the journey. = 我们将在旅程的这一段使用恒向线。

虚拟语气:
If we used a great circle route, the journey would be shorter. = 如果我们使用大圆航线，旅程将会更短。(对比rhumb line)
I wish we had followed a rhumb line; the navigation would have been easier. = 我希望我们沿着恒向线航行；导航会更容易。(对比其他航线)


被动语态:
The rhumb line course was carefully plotted. = 恒向线航线被仔细地规划出来。
The ship's position was determined using the rhumb line method. = 船舶的位置是使用恒向线法确定的。


疑问句:
Is this a rhumb line course? = 这是恒向线航线吗？
What is the advantage of using a rhumb line? = 使用恒向线的优势是什么？


否定句:
This is not a rhumb line; it's a great circle route. = 这不是恒向线；这是一条大圆航线。
They did not follow the rhumb line accurately. = 他们没有准确地遵循恒向线。


PHRASE->
rhumb line navigation = 恒向线导航
follow a rhumb line = 沿着恒向线航行
plot a rhumb line = 绘制恒向线
calculate a rhumb line = 计算恒向线
sail on a rhumb line = 沿着恒向线航行
