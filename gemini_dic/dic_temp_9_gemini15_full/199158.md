silicic:/sɪˈlɪsɪk/| adj.|硅质的；含硅的 | Relating to or containing silica.  Silicic refers to substances rich in silica (silicon dioxide), a compound of silicon and oxygen.  It often describes rocks, minerals, and solutions with a high silica content. |The silicic magma erupted explosively, forming a pyroclastic flow.  硅质岩浆爆发性喷发，形成了火山碎屑流。

The silicic rocks of the area are highly resistant to weathering.  该地区的硅质岩石具有很强的抗风化能力。


近义词：siliceous

反义词：non-siliceous


词源: From silica + -ic.  The suffix "-ic" is used to form adjectives indicating relation to or resemblance to something.  Silica itself derives from silicon, ultimately from Latin *silex, silicis meaning "flint".


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The rock sample is silicic in nature. = 这块岩石样本本质上是硅质的。
This solution contains a high concentration of silicic acid. = 此溶液含有高浓度的硅酸。


一般过去时:
The geologist classified the rock as silicic. = 地质学家将岩石归类为硅质的。
The analysis showed that the soil was predominantly silicic. = 分析表明土壤主要为硅质的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several silicic minerals in the sample. = 科学家们已经在样本中鉴定了几种硅质矿物。
Geologists have determined that the region is rich in silicic deposits. = 地质学家已经确定该地区富含硅质矿床。


过去完成时:
Before the eruption, the volcano had expelled silicic lava. = 在火山喷发之前，火山已经喷出了硅质熔岩。
The researchers had already analyzed the silicic composition of the sediment. = 研究人员已经分析了沉积物的硅质成分。

疑问句:
Is this type of rock silicic? = 这种岩石是硅质的吗？
Are the minerals in this sample primarily silicic? = 这个样本中的矿物主要为硅质的吗？


否定句:
The rock is not silicic; it's primarily mafic. = 这块岩石不是硅质的；它主要是基性的。
The composition of the lava flow was not entirely silicic. = 熔岩流的成分并非完全是硅质的。
