词源:
The word "goarish" doesn't have a readily traceable etymology in standard dictionaries. It's likely a relatively recent coinage, possibly formed by analogy to other words ending in "-ish," which are often used to create adjectives suggesting a degree or quality.  The implied connection to gore (blood) contributes to its meaning.  Its rarity suggests it may be a dialectal word or a neologism.
