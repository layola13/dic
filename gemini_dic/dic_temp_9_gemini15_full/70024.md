词源:

The word "fetishising" is derived from the noun "fetish," which ultimately originates from the Portuguese word "feitiço," meaning "charm" or "magic."  The term was adopted into English in the 18th century and has undergone a semantic shift, evolving from its original meaning referring to objects believed to possess magical properties to its more modern usage, encompassing both sexual and non-sexual obsessions.
