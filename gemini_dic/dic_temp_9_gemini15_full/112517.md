词源:  The word "lout" ultimately derives from the Old English word "lut," meaning "bent," "bowed," or "humble."  Over time, its meaning shifted to describe someone who is awkward and clumsy, eventually developing its current connotation of being uncouth and ill-mannered.  The connection likely lies in the association of a physically awkward posture with a lack of social grace.
