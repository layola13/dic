ducable:/ˈdjuːkəbl/| adj.| 可延展的，可拉伸的 |  Ducable refers to something that can be drawn out or extended in length, usually referring to materials like metals.  It implies a malleability and capacity to be shaped without breaking. | Example:  The ducable nature of copper allows for the creation of thin wires.  铜的可延展性使得制造细线成为可能。|近义词：malleable, ductile, tensile|反义词：brittle, inflexible


USAGE->

The material was found to be highly ducable after the experiment. = 实验后发现这种材料具有很高的延展性。


疑问句:
Is this material ducable? = 这种材料可延展吗？
Are all metals ducable? = 所有金属都可延展吗？


否定句:
The substance is not ducable. = 这种物质不可延展。
That metal is not very ducable. = 那种金属不太易延展。



PHRASE->
highly ducable = 高度延展的
relatively ducable = 相对延展的
sufficiently ducable = 足够延展的
easily ducable = 易于延展的
less ducable = 不太延展的
