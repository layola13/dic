词源:  The word "cuddy" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "cude," meaning "cabin" or "small room."  This, in turn, may be related to Old Norse words associated with boats and shelters.  The specific evolution of the word's meaning from a general small room to its more specific nautical and stable connotations happened over time.
