The word "sautrie" does not appear to be a word in standard English, nor is it readily found in major dictionaries or etymological resources.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Please double-check the spelling.
2. **It's a proper noun:**  Perhaps it's a place name, a person's name, or a brand name.
3. **It's a neologism or archaic word:** It might be a recently coined word, a word used in a very specific context, or an obsolete word no longer in common use.
4. **It's from another language:**  The word might originate from a different language and have a different meaning. If you can provide context (where you encountered the word), it might help in identifying its origin and meaning.
