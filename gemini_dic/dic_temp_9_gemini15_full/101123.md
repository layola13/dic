词源:
The word "invested" comes from the Latin word "vestire," meaning "to clothe" or "to dress."  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the idea of "endowing" or "furnishing" something with resources.  The prefix "in-" indicates "into" or "within," signifying the act of placing something within something else (like resources into a venture).
