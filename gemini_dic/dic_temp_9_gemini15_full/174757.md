词源:
The word "rabbiting" is derived from the noun "rabbit," referring to the animal known for its quick movements.  The verb form reflects the rapid and seemingly uncontrolled nature of both the animal's movement and, metaphorically, rapid and uninterrupted speech.  The onomatopoeic quality of the word also contributes to its effectiveness in conveying the sense of quick, repetitive actions.
