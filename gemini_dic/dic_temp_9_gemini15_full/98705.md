词源:
The word "insupportablenesses" is derived from the adjective "insupportable," which itself is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "supportable," meaning "able to be supported or endured."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality. The addition of "-es" pluralizes the noun, referring to multiple instances of insupportability.  Therefore, the word's root lies in the concept of "not being able to be supported or endured."
