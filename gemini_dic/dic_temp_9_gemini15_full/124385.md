词源:
The word "motley" itself comes from the Middle English word "motle," meaning "many colored," ultimately deriving from the Old French "motlee," a variant of "mi-partie," meaning "half-and-half" or "parti-colored."  Adding the superlative suffix "-est" creates "motleyest," signifying the highest degree of variety or diversity in color or character.
