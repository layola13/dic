inflections:/ɪnˈflɛkʃənz/ | n. | 词形变化；屈折变化 | The changes in the form of a word, typically the addition of prefixes or suffixes, to express grammatical relationships, such as tense, number, person, gender, case, or mood.  Inflections are a key part of morphology, the study of word formation. | Example: The plural inflection "-s" is added to most English nouns.  (例如：复数词尾“-s”加在大多数英语名词上。)  The verb "to be" has many inflections to indicate tense and person. (例如：动词“to be”有很多词形变化来表示时态和人称。) |近义词：bendings, modulations, variations | 反义词：None directly applicable.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The word "cat" has no inflections in the present tense, singular. = 单数现在时，“cat”这个词没有词形变化。
The verb "walks" shows inflection for the third-person singular present tense. = 动词“walks”显示了第三人称单数现在时的词形变化。


一般过去时:
The past tense inflection "-ed" is added to regular verbs. = 规则动词加上过去时词尾“-ed”。
The irregular verb "went" shows a different inflection than "go". = 不规则动词“went”的词形变化与“go”不同。


现在完成时:
The present perfect tense often uses the auxiliary verb "have" plus a past participle inflection. = 完成时态通常使用助动词“have”加上过去分词的词形变化。
"Has walked" demonstrates both auxiliary verb and past participle inflection. = “Has walked”既展示了助动词，也展示了过去分词的词形变化。


过去完成时:
The past perfect tense uses "had" plus a past participle inflection. = 过去完成时使用“had”加上过去分词的词形变化。
"Had walked" shows the past perfect inflection. = “Had walked”显示了过去完成时的词形变化。


将来时:
Future tense inflections are typically formed using "will" or "shall". = 将来时的词形变化通常用“will”或“shall”构成。
"Will walk" shows a future tense inflection. = “Will walk”显示了将来时的词形变化。


虚拟语气:
Subjunctive mood inflections are often less distinct in modern English. = 在现代英语中，虚拟语气的词形变化通常不太明显。
"Were" in "If I were you..." is a subjunctive inflection. = “If I were you...”中的“were”是虚拟语气的词形变化。


被动语态:
Passive voice constructions often involve inflections on the auxiliary verb and past participle. = 被动语态结构通常涉及助动词和过去分词的词形变化。
"Was walked" shows a passive voice inflection. = “Was walked”显示了被动语态的词形变化。


疑问句:
Inflections don't directly create questions, but word order and auxiliary verbs do. = 词形变化不能直接构成疑问句，但词序和助动词可以。
"Did he walk?" uses inflection in the auxiliary verb. = “Did he walk?”在助动词中使用了词形变化。


否定句:
Negation is achieved with auxiliary verbs, not primarily through inflections. = 否定是通过助动词实现的，而不是主要通过词形变化。
"He did not walk" uses the negative auxiliary "did not". = “He did not walk”使用了否定助动词“did not”。
