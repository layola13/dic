The word "lowgh" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A dialect word:** It might be a word used in a specific regional dialect or slang.  If you can provide context (where you encountered the word), it might be possible to identify its meaning.
* **A neologism or invented word:** It could be a newly coined word, a name, or a word created for a specific purpose (e.g., in fiction).
