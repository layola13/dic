英文解析:
The median refers to the middle value in a dataset that is ordered from least to greatest.  If there's an even number of data points, the median is the average of the two middle values.  It's a statistical measure used to represent the central tendency of a dataset, less sensitive to outliers than the mean (average).  In geometry, a median can also refer to a line segment from a vertex of a triangle to the midpoint of the opposite side.
