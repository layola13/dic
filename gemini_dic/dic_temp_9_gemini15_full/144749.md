**2. Over-care (as a verb):**

This would be grammatically incorrect.  To express the idea, one would use "overcare for"  or a similar phrase.

A correct version would be "The effects of overcare were detrimental."



In conclusion, while "over-care's" isn't a valid word, understanding the potential meaning of "overcare" allows for correct usage within sentences. Remember to use it as a noun and not attempt to make it possessive in the same way you would with a regular noun.
