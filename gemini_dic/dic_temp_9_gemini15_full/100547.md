The word "interwed" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or archaic lexicon.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer some suggestions.
