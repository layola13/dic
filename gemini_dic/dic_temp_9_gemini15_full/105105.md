词源:
The word "kerosene" is derived from the Greek word "keras" (κέρας), meaning "wax," and the suffix "-ene," a common suffix for hydrocarbons.  The name reflects its waxy consistency and its chemical nature as a hydrocarbon.  It was initially called "kerosine" before evolving into its current spelling.
