词源:
The word "performed" comes from the Old French word "perfformer," which means "to accomplish" or "to fulfill."  This in turn derives from the Latin word "perficere," which is a compound of "per-" (through, completely) and "facere" (to make, do).  Therefore, the root meaning points to the complete execution or making of something.
