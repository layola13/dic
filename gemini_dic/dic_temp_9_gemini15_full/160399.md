词源:

The word "popover" is believed to be derived from the verb "to popover," meaning "to puff up" or "to swell." This reflects the characteristic puffing up of the bread during baking.  The ultimate origins may be related to older words describing swelling or bulging.  A definitive etymological trace is difficult to pinpoint, but the descriptive nature of the word suggests a natural evolution based on its appearance and method of preparation.
