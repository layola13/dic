词源：The phrase is a combination of "out" (meaning completely or thoroughly) and "and out" (reinforcing the completeness).  The "out" is used twice for emphasis.  The origin is uncertain but dates back to at least the 19th century.  It's likely a colloquialism that evolved naturally through the repetition of "out" for emphasis.
