词源:
The word "entitlement" comes from the Old French word "entitlement," meaning "title," "right," or "claim."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "intitulatum," a past participle of "intitulare," meaning "to give a title to," which is composed of "in-" (in, into) and "titulus" (title).  The modern English meaning evolved from the concept of having a title or right to something.
