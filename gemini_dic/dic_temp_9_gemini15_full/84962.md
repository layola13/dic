haploids:/ˈhæplɔɪdz/| n. | 单倍体 | A haploid cell or organism is one that has only one complete set of chromosomes.  This is in contrast to diploid organisms, which have two sets.  Haploid cells are often involved in sexual reproduction, such as gametes (sperm and egg cells).| Example:  Gametes are haploid cells. 配子是单倍体细胞。

The process of meiosis produces haploid cells from diploid cells. 减数分裂的过程是由二倍体细胞产生单倍体细胞。|近义词：monoploid |反义词：diploid
