The word "preconcurring" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  It appears to be a newly coined or very rarely used word, likely formed by combining "pre-" (before) and "concurring" (agreeing).  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage examples are impossible to provide.


However, we can analyze its potential meaning and construction:


/ˌpriːkənˈkɜːrɪŋ/ | adj. | 预先一致的；预先同意的 |  Potentially meaning agreeing beforehand; concurring in advance. |  Example: *There was no preconcurring agreement on the project's budget.* (This is a hypothetical example) |  Near Synonyms:  pre-agreed, previously agreed upon | Antonyms:  disagreeing, dissenting, conflicting |  adj.


Because it's not a standard word, providing grammatical examples in various tenses, voices, etc., would be artificial and unhelpful.  The word would function grammatically as an adjective.


PHRASE->
(Due to the non-standard nature of the word, phrases are hard to create meaningfully.  One *might* hypothetically construct a phrase like "preconcurring approval", but its use would still be unusual and require significant context.)
