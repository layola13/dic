词源:

The word "sackcloth" comes from the Old English *sacc and clāþ.  *Sacc means "sack" or "bag," while clāþ means "cloth." Therefore, sackcloth literally means "cloth made from sacks."  The use of rough, coarse cloth to make clothing is an ancient practice, and sackcloth's association with mourning and repentance stems from biblical accounts.
