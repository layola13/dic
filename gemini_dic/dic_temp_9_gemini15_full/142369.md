USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the field of crystallography and mineralogy, so grammatical examples are limited to its specific context.  There aren't common everyday usages like "What" or "Hello". Therefore, standard grammatical tenses are not applicable in the same way.  Instead, we provide examples illustrating its use in descriptive sentences:

A simple sentence:
The mineral exhibited a well-developed orthopinacoid. = 这种矿物展现了一个发育良好的正交双锥体。


A sentence with a relative clause:
The crystal, which showed a prominent orthopinacoid, was identified as aragonite. =  这颗晶体，展现了一个显著的正交双锥体，被鉴定为文石。


A sentence with a prepositional phrase:
The presence of the orthopinacoid helped determine the crystal system. = 正交双锥体的存在有助于确定晶系。


A sentence in the passive voice:
The orthopinacoid was carefully measured using a goniometer. = 正交双锥体使用测角仪被仔细测量。


A sentence describing its characteristics:
