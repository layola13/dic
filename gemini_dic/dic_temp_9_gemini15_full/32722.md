chlorite:/ˈklɔːraɪt/| n. |绿泥石|A group of closely related hydrous phyllosilicate minerals, typically green in color and often found in metamorphic rocks.  They are characterized by their layered structure and soft, earthy texture. Chlorites are common alteration products of other minerals, especially mafic silicates like biotite and amphibole.|Example: The metamorphic rock sample contained significant amounts of chlorite, indicating alteration under low-grade conditions.  绿泥石样本中含有大量的绿泥石，表明在低级条件下发生了蚀变。|近义词：serpentine, talc |反义词：N/A
