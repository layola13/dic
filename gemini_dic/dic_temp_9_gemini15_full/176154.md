rcu:/ˈɑːrˈsiːjuː/|/ˈɑːrˈsiːjuː/| n. |读写并发控制|Read-Copy Update.  A concurrency control method used in computer science, particularly in operating systems and databases, that allows multiple threads or processes to access and modify shared data concurrently without the need for traditional locking mechanisms.  It achieves this by creating copies of data structures before modifying them, ensuring that readers always see a consistent view while writers create new versions.  |例句：RCU is a powerful technique for minimizing latency in highly concurrent systems. = RCU 是在高并发系统中最小化延迟的强大技术。

例句：The implementation of RCU in this kernel significantly improved performance under heavy load. = 在这个内核中实现 RCU 在高负载下显著提高了性能。
