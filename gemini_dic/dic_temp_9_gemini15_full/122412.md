词源:

The word "money" originates from the ancient Roman term "moneta," which was the name given to the temple of Juno Moneta, where coins were minted.  "Moneta" itself is derived from "monēre," meaning "to warn" or "to advise," reflecting the importance of sound financial practices. Over time, "moneta" evolved into "money" in various European languages.
