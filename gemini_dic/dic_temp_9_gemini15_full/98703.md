词源:

The word "insupportable" comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") + "supportable" (meaning "able to be supported or endured").  "Supportable" itself derives from the verb "support," ultimately from Old French *soustenir and Latin *subtenēre, meaning "to hold up from below".  Therefore, "insupportable" literally means "not able to be supported or endured."
