词源:  From Latin *imprecoratōrius, from imprecari "to call upon," from in- "upon" + precari "to pray, beg."  The word reflects the original sense of calling upon a deity for help, which could be either a blessing or a curse.  Over time, the sense shifted more towards the negative, focusing on the aspect of cursing.
