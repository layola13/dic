double-action:/ˈdʌbəlˈækʃən/| adj. |双动力的；双作用的|Having two actions or effects, typically in a coordinated or reciprocal way.  A double-action mechanism involves two distinct operations or stages that work together.  For example, a double-action revolver allows for both cocking and firing with a single trigger pull. |例句：The double-action revolver is a popular sidearm for its efficient firing mechanism.  这把双动式左轮手枪以其高效的射击机制而广受欢迎。


The pump operates on a double-action principle, drawing in fluid on one stroke and discharging it on the next.  这个泵采用双动原理，一次行程吸入流体，另一次行程排出流体。|近义词：dual-action, two-stage|反义词：single-action
