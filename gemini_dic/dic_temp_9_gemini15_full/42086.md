词源:

The word "cotquean" has an obscure etymology.  Its origins are uncertain, but several theories exist.  One popular theory connects it to "cot," meaning a small cottage or bed, and "quean," an archaic word for a woman (often implying a negative connotation, suggesting a loose or unchaste woman).  This suggests an image of a woman gossiping and interfering in the confines of her cottage. Another theory proposes a connection to "coquet," suggesting a flirtatious or mischievous woman.  The exact origin and evolution remain debated.
