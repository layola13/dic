词源:

The word "foistiness" derives from the older word "foist," meaning to impose something fraudulently or unfairly.  While the connection might seem tenuous, the sense of something being "imposed" upon a space (like a bad smell) likely contributed to its evolution.  The "-iness" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, indicating a quality or state.  The association with decay and unpleasantness evolved over time.
