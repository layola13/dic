USAGE->
This word is an adjective and therefore does not have verb conjugations.  The usage is primarily predicative (e.g., "He was cloth-eared.") or attributive (e.g., "a cloth-eared response").  It describes a state of being rather than an action.  There is no past, present, future, or other tense to conjugate.  It's not used in passive or active voice constructions in the way a verb would be.  It's simply used to describe someone or something.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "cloth-eared."  Its archaic nature limits its usage in phrasal contexts.
