The word "cracowes" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling or provide more context where you encountered this word?

2. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a proper noun, perhaps a place name or a surname, specific to a particular region or family.  Again, more context is needed.

3. **It's a neologism or archaic word:** It could be a newly coined word, or a word that was used in the past but is no longer common.  Without more information, it's impossible to determine its meaning or origin.

4. **It's a dialectal word:** It might be a word used in a specific dialect of English, not widely understood.

To provide the requested analysis, I need the correct spelling or more context surrounding the word's usage.  Please provide additional information.
