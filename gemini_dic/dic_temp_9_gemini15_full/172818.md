ETYMOLOGY->
The word "quadripinnate" is derived from the following components:

* **quadri-:**  From Latin "quadri-", meaning "four."
* **pinnate:** From Latin "pinnatus," the past participle of "pinnare," meaning "to feather" or "to have feathers."  This refers to the feather-like arrangement of leaflets on a stem.

Therefore, "quadripinnate" literally means "four times feathered" or "four times pinnate," accurately describing the four levels of branching in the leaf structure.
