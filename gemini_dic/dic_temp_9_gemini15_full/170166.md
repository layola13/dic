protophyte:/ˈproʊtoʊfaɪt/| n. |原植体，原始植物|A protophyte is a simple, usually unicellular or colonial organism considered to be an early form of plant life.  They lack the complex structures found in more advanced plants.  They are often found in aquatic environments.  |Example:  The study focused on the evolution of protophytes into more complex plant forms.  这项研究集中在原植体向更复杂的植物形态的进化。|近义词：primitive plant, simple plant |反义词：advanced plant, complex plant
