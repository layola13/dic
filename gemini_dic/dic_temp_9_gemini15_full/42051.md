词源:
The word "cosy" ultimately derives from the Middle Dutch word *cosij, meaning "a pillowcase." The modern Dutch word equivalent is *kussenhoes*.  The sense evolved from the feeling of comfort and warmth associated with a pillowcase to a broader sense of comfort and warmth in general.  The word entered English in the 18th century.
