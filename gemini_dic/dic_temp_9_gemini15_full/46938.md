词源:  The word is derived from "damned," an intensified form of "damn," an expletive meaning "cursed."  The "darned" form arose as a milder euphemism to avoid the stronger profanity. Adding "-est" creates a superlative, implying the highest degree.  The spelling "darnedest" reflects the common pronunciation and spelling variations that occur with euphemisms.  The etymology ultimately traces back to Old English "demanian," meaning "to condemn" or "to curse."
