词源:
The word "convenient" comes from the Old French word *convenient*, meaning "fitting, suitable."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word *conveniens*, the present participle of *convenire*, meaning "to come together," "to agree," or "to be suitable."  The implication is that something convenient "fits" or "agrees" with one's needs.
