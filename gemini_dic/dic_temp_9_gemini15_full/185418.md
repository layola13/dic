retroviruses:/ˌrɛtroʊˈvaɪrəsɪz/ | n. |逆转录病毒|Retroviruses are a group of RNA viruses that replicate in a host cell through the process of reverse transcription. This means they use an enzyme called reverse transcriptase to convert their RNA genome into DNA, which is then integrated into the host cell's genome.  This allows the retrovirus to replicate along with the host cell.  Examples include HIV and some types of cancer-causing viruses.|Example: HIV is a retrovirus that causes AIDS.|近义词:RNA viruses|反义词:DNA viruses
