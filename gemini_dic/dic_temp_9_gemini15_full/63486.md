The word "entryng" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or an archaic/obsolete form.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered "entryng."  Is it from a historical text?  A specific author?  Knowing the source will allow for a more accurate interpretation and analysis.
