词源:  The word "overofficious" combines the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much") with "officious," which derives from the Latin word "officiosus," meaning "obliging," "helpful," or "attentive to duty."  However, the modern meaning of "officious" carries a negative connotation, implying excessive and unwanted helpfulness or interference.  Therefore, "overofficious" emphasizes the excessive nature of this unwanted helpfulness.
