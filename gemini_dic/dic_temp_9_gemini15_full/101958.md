isoallelic: /ˌaɪsoʊəˈliːlɪk/ | adj. | 等位基因的；同等位基因的 |  Referring to alleles that are identical in their DNA sequence.  Isoalleles are variants of a gene that have no detectable phenotypic effect, meaning they don't produce a noticeable difference in the organism's characteristics.  They are often discovered through DNA sequencing. |  The study revealed several isoallelic variants of the gene responsible for eye color, all resulting in the same brown eye phenotype. |  近义词: synonymous (in this specific genetic context) | 反义词:  allelic variants with phenotypic effects (e.g., different eye colors caused by different alleles)
