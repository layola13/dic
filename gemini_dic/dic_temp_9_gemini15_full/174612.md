quitrent:/ˈkwɪtrɛnt/| n.|年租，地租|A quitrent is a fixed annual rent paid to a landlord in lieu of services or other obligations.  It's a relatively small sum, and often represents a symbolic payment rather than a significant financial burden.  The term originates from the idea that the tenant has "quit" (released) other obligations in exchange for paying the rent. |例句：The farmer paid a small quitrent to the lord of the manor.  这位农民向庄园主支付了一笔小额年租。

The quitrent on the property was surprisingly low. 这处房产的地租出奇的低。


近义词：rent, ground rent, annual rent|反义词：none|词性：名词


词源:

The word "quitrent" is a compound word.  "Quit" comes from the Old French "quiter," meaning "to release, to free, to leave."  "Rent" comes from the Old French "rente," meaning "income, revenue." Therefore, a quitrent is literally a "released rent," implying a release from other obligations in exchange for a fixed annual payment.


用法说明:

Quitrent is primarily a historical term, though it might still be encountered in legal contexts related to ancient land tenures.  It's rarely used in modern everyday language concerning rental agreements.  Its use emphasizes the historical context of land ownership and feudal obligations.  The modern equivalent is typically just "rent."
