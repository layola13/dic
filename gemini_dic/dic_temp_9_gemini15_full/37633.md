commutability:/ˌkɒmjuːtəˈbɪləti/| /ˌkɑːmjuːtəˈbɪləti/ | n. |可交换性，对易性|The property of being able to be commuted;  the ability of two or more things to be interchanged without altering the result.  This term is frequently used in mathematics and computer science.  For example, in mathematics, the commutative property states that the order of operands does not affect the result (e.g., addition and multiplication are commutative). In computer science, it might refer to the interchangeability of processes or operations.|Example: The commutative property of addition means that 2 + 3 is the same as 3 + 2.  The program demonstrates the commutability of its sorting algorithm. |近义词：interchangeability, permutability|反义词：non-commutability


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a technical context (mathematics, computer science) and doesn't have typical grammatical usages like the example word "what."  Therefore, providing examples of tenses, voices, etc., is not applicable.  The word itself functions as a noun.


PHRASE->
Commutability of operators:  The ability of operators to be exchanged without changing the result.
Commutability of matrices:  The property of matrices where AB = BA.
Commutability of diagrams: The ability to rearrange diagrammatic elements without affecting the result.
