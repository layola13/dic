词源:

The word "noncivilized" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "civilized."  "Civilized" itself originates from the late Middle English word "civilized," derived from the Old French "civilisé," and ultimately from the Latin "civilis," meaning "of or relating to citizens, civil."  Therefore, "noncivilized" literally means "not relating to or characteristic of a citizen or society exhibiting characteristics considered proper and advanced."
