carnot:/kɑːˈnoʊ/| /ˈkɑːnɔːt/ | n. |卡诺；卡诺循环 |Carnot refers to Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot, a French physicist, and his contributions to thermodynamics, specifically the Carnot cycle.  The term is used in physics and engineering to describe concepts related to this cycle and its efficiency.  |The Carnot cycle is a theoretical thermodynamic cycle that provides an upper limit on the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic engine. |近义词：Carnot cycle, reversible cycle |反义词：irreversible cycle
