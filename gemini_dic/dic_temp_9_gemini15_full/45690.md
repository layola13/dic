词源:
The word "curtsey" comes from the Old French word "courtoisie," meaning "courtesy," which in turn derives from the Latin word "cortis," meaning "court."  The association with the courtly gesture of respect is clear.  Over time, the spelling evolved to its current form, and the meaning narrowed to specifically refer to the female gesture of bending the knee.
