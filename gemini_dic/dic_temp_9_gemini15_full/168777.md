词源:  The word "prodissolution" is a relatively uncommon word formed by combining the prefix "pro-" (meaning "forward" or "before") with "dissolution" (the act of dissolving or breaking down).  Therefore, it emphasizes the process leading *towards* dissolution.  It's not a standard dictionary entry but is understandable in context.
