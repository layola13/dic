recedence:/rɪˈsiːdəns/| n. |退去；衰退；隐退|The receding of the tide. 退潮。|The slow but steady recedence of the empire. 帝国缓慢而稳定的衰落。|近义词：regression, decline, retreat|反义词：advance, progress, ascendancy


The word "recedence" is not a commonly used word in modern English.  While dictionaries may list it, its usage is extremely limited and it's often considered archaic or overly formal.  It's best to use more common synonyms in most contexts.


词源:  The word is derived from the verb "recede," which itself comes from the Old French word "receder" and ultimately from the Latin "recedere," meaning "to go back" or "to withdraw."  The suffix "-ence" forms a noun indicating a state, quality, or action.


用法说明:

Although the word exists,  it's functionally equivalent to using "regression," "decline," "retreat," or similar words describing a backward movement or decrease.


例句:


The recedence of the floodwaters allowed residents to return to their homes. = 洪水退去后，居民们可以回家了。(This sentence is grammatically correct but using "recession" of the floodwaters would be more natural.)


There was a noticeable recedence in the company's profits after the merger. = 合并后，公司利润明显下降。(Again, "decline" or "decrease" would be preferred in modern English.)
