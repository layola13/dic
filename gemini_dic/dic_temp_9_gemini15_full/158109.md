plastids:/ˈplæstɪdz/| n.|质体|Plastids are membrane-bound organelles found in the cells of plants and algae.  They are responsible for manufacturing and storing food.  Different types of plastids perform different functions, including photosynthesis (chloroplasts), starch storage (amyloplasts), and pigment storage (chromoplasts).| Example: Chloroplasts are a type of plastid that contains chlorophyll and carries out photosynthesis.|近义词:organelle|反义词:None
