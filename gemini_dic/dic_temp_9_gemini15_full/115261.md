词源:  The word "manipulator" comes from the Latin word "manipulus," meaning "a handful," referring to a small bundle or group.  This evolved into the verb "manipulate," originally meaning to handle or manage skillfully, particularly with the hands.  Over time, the meaning shifted to include the sense of controlling or influencing others in a subtle or devious way.
