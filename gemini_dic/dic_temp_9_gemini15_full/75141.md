词源:
The word "first" originates from Old English "fyrst,"  which is related to the Proto-Germanic "*furstaz," meaning "foremost, first."  This in turn is connected to the Proto-Indo-European root "*per-", meaning "before, forward."  The evolution shows a clear path from a word denoting forward position to its current meaning of being the first in order or time.
