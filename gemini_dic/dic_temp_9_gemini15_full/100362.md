/ɪntərˈstɪmjʊləsiːz/ | n. | 刺激间|  The word "interstimuluses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, possibly a combination of "inter-" (between, among) and "stimuli" (plural of stimulus).  It would likely refer to the interactions or relationships between different stimuli.  There is no established definition, usage, synonyms, or antonyms.  Since it's not a real word, providing grammatical examples is impossible.  Its meaning would depend entirely on the context in which it's used.  If encountered, one would need to infer its meaning based on surrounding text.
