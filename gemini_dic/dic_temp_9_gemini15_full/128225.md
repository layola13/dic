neurocyte: /ˈnʊroʊsaɪt/ | n. | 神经细胞 | A neurocyte is a nerve cell; a neuron.  It is the fundamental unit of the nervous system, responsible for receiving, processing, and transmitting information.  Neurocytes communicate with each other through synapses, using chemical and electrical signals.  They are highly specialized cells with diverse morphologies and functions depending on their location and role in the nervous system. | Example:  The study focused on the impact of the drug on neurocyte activity. 这项研究侧重于药物对神经细胞活动的影响。 |近义词：neuron, nerve cell |反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The neurocyte transmits signals rapidly. = 神经细胞快速传递信号。
This neurocyte receives sensory input. = 这个神经细胞接收感觉输入。


一般过去时:
The neurocyte fired an action potential. = 神经细胞发出动作电位。
The researchers observed the neurocyte's response. = 研究人员观察了神经细胞的反应。


现在完成时:
The scientists have identified a new type of neurocyte. = 科学家们已经识别出一种新型的神经细胞。
Damage to the neurocytes has already occurred. = 神经细胞的损伤已经发生。


过去完成时:
The neurocyte had already depolarized before the stimulus arrived. = 在刺激到达之前，神经细胞已经去极化。
