词源:
The word "deceivers" comes from the verb "deceive," which originates from Old French *deceyvre,  itself from the Latin *decipere.  "De-" is a prefix meaning "away from" or "down," and "*capere" means "to take" or "to seize."  Therefore, the root meaning is to "take away" or "mislead" someone from the truth. The "-er" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, denoting a person who performs the action.
