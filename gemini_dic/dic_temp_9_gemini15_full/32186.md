chiasmus:/kaɪˈæzməs/| n. | 交错配列；对句；回文式结构 | A rhetorical device in which two or more clauses are balanced against each other by the reversal of their structures in order to produce an artistic effect.  It involves a criss-cross arrangement of words, clauses, or sentences.  This creates a pleasing and memorable effect, often highlighting a contrast or emphasizing a point. | Example: "By day the frolic, and the dance by night."  This sentence uses chiasmus because the structure is "A B, and B A". |近义词：antimetabole, parallelism (in some contexts) | 反义词：None specifically, but the opposite would be a lack of structural symmetry. |


USAGE->

This word is primarily a literary term and doesn't have typical verb conjugations or tenses like "what" does.  It describes a grammatical structure, not a verb action.  Therefore, providing examples in various tenses is not applicable.  Instead, here are examples illustrating different types of chiasmus:


Simple Chiasmus:
"Eat to live, not live to eat." =  食以求生，非生以求食。

Complex Chiasmus:
"Pleasure's a shadow; shadows fly." = 快乐如影，而影子飞逝。


Chiasmus with Parallelism:
"Ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country." = 不要问你的国家能为你做什么——问问你能为你的国家做什么。


Chiasmus emphasizing Contrast:
"Love is an ideal thing, marriage a real thing." = 爱是理想的事物，婚姻是现实的事物。


PHRASE->

Chiasmus is not typically used in phrases in the same way a common word like "what" is. It describes a stylistic choice within a sentence or passage.  Therefore, providing common phrases is not applicable.  Instead, consider these examples as illustrating the *concept* of chiasmus within a larger phrase or sentence:


"The fair breeze blew, the white foam flew." = 和风吹拂，白浪飞溅。


"Never let a fool kiss you or a kiss fool you." = 不要让傻瓜吻你，也不要让吻愚弄你。

"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."  (While not perfectly symmetrical, the parallel structure and inversion demonstrate the principle of chiasmus).  = 我有一个梦想，我的四个孩子有一天将生活在一个国家，在那里他们不会因为肤色而被评判，而是因为他们的品格。
