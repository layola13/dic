semianalytical: /ˌsemiˈænəˈlɪtɪkəl/ | adj. | 半解析的；半分析的 | Combining analytical and numerical methods;  approximating analytical solutions with numerical techniques.  A semianalytical method uses analytical solutions where possible and numerical methods where analytical solutions are not available or too complex.  This approach often leads to more efficient and accurate results compared to purely numerical methods, especially for complex problems. |
