necrosis:/nəˈkroʊsɪs/| n. |坏死；组织坏死 |The death of body tissue due to disease, injury, or lack of blood supply.  Necrosis is a form of cell injury which results in the premature death of cells in living tissue. This is in contrast to apoptosis, or programmed cell death, which is a natural and controlled process. Necrosis is typically characterized by inflammation and the release of cellular contents into the surrounding tissue, which can trigger an immune response. Different types of necrosis exist, depending on the cause and appearance of the damaged tissue.  | Example: The untreated wound led to necrosis of the surrounding tissue.  未经处理的伤口导致周围组织坏死。

The extensive burn resulted in severe necrosis of the skin.  严重的烧伤导致皮肤严重坏死。|近义词：gangrene, mortification |反义词：regeneration, healing
