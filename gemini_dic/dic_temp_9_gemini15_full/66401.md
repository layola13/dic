词源:
execution comes from the Old French *execucion*, and ultimately from the Latin *exsecutio*, from the verb *exsequi*, meaning "to follow out," "to follow up," or "to perform."  The prefix *ex-* means "out" or "completely," and *sequi* means "to follow."  Thus, the original meaning implied a thorough following through of something.
