The word "cururo" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It's likely a word from another language, a proper noun, a neologism (newly coined word), or a misspelling.  To provide the requested analysis, further context is needed, such as:

* **The language of origin:** Is it from Spanish, Portuguese, a Native American language, or another language?
* **The context in which you encountered the word:**  A sentence or paragraph containing the word would be helpful.

Without this information, I cannot provide pronunciation, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc.
