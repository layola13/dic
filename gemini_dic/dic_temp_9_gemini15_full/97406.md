infrigidation: /ɪnˈfrɪdʒɪdeɪʃən/ | n. | 使寒冷；使冰冷；冷却 | The act of making something cold or frigid; the state of being made cold or frigid.  It is a relatively rare word, often found in more literary or scientific contexts. | Example: The infrigidating winds swept across the plains.  凛冽的寒风席卷了平原。 The infrigidation of the sample was crucial for the experiment. 样本的冷却对于实验至关重要。| 近义词：cooling, chilling, refrigeration | 反义词：heating, warming


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The wind causes infrigidations in the mountains. = 风导致山区降温。
