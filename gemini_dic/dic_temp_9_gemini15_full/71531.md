词源:

The word derives from "flapper," a term for a young woman of the 1920s known for her rebellious and unconventional behavior, short bobbed hair, and loose-fitting clothing. The term "flapper" itself is thought to have originated from the flapping motion of young birds learning to fly, suggesting a similar sense of youthful exuberance and sometimes clumsy inexperience.  The "-ish" suffix adds a descriptive quality, suggesting a tendency or resemblance to the characteristic behavior of a flapper.
