overdeliberatenesses:/ˌoʊvər dɪˌlɪbəˈreɪt nəsɪz/ | n. |过度深思熟虑；反复斟酌 |The excessive amount of overdeliberatenesses led to missed deadlines.  过度深思熟虑导致错过最后期限。|近义词：procrastination, vacillation, hesitation |反义词：impulsiveness, decisiveness


This word is not a standard English word. It's a rather artificial formation, created by adding the prefix "over-" to the noun "deliberateness," and then making it plural.  Let's break down the components:

* **over-:**  A prefix meaning "too much," "excessively," or "beyond."

* **deliberateness:** This noun means the quality of being deliberate; careful and slow consideration.  It comes from the adjective "deliberate," which has its roots in the Latin word "deliberatus," the past participle of "deliberare" (to weigh, consider).

Therefore, "overdeliberatenesses" would theoretically refer to instances of excessive or undue deliberation, taking things too far in the process of careful consideration.  It suggests a fault of excessive pondering, leading to inaction or delays.

Because it's not a standard word, there are no standard usages or grammatical examples readily available.  One might encounter it in highly specialized or informal contexts, but it would likely be replaced with more common and natural alternatives in formal writing or speech.  Better alternatives include phrases like:

* Excessive deliberation
* Overthinking
* Procrastination due to indecision
* Endless pondering
* Analysis paralysis

The word is unusual enough that providing grammatical examples in various tenses is not practical. The meaning is clear from the components, and usage would follow the standard rules for plural nouns.
