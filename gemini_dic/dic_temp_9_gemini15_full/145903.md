词源:
The word "overdiffusing" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively) and the verb "diffusing" (spreading or scattering something widely).  "Diffusing" itself comes from the Latin word "diffundere," meaning "to pour out in different directions."  Therefore, "overdiffusing" literally means "excessively pouring out in different directions."
