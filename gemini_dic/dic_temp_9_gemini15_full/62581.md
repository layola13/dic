Word Origin:  The word "enervator" comes from the verb "enervate,"  meaning to weaken or deprive of force.  The suffix "-ator" transforms the verb into a noun, signifying the agent or instrument of the action.  "Enervate" itself ultimately derives from the Latin "e-," meaning "out," and "nervus," meaning "nerve" or "sinew,"  indicating a depletion of strength or vitality.
