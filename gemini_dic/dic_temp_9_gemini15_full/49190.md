词源:
The name "Delaware" comes from the Delaware River, which in turn is named after Lord De La Warr, the governor of Virginia in the early 17th century.  The Lenape people, also known as the Delaware Indians, inhabited the region.  The name originally referred to the river and the tribe, and later extended to the state.
