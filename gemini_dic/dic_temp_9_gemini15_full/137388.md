词源:

The word "nontenable" is formed by adding the negative prefix "non-" to "tenable."  "Tenable" comes from the Old French word "tenable," meaning "holdable," derived from the Latin "tenēre," meaning "to hold."  Therefore, "nontenable" literally means "not holdable," in the sense of not able to be maintained or defended.
