词源:

The word "excruciating" comes from the Latin word "excruciare," which means "to torture."  The prefix "ex-" intensifies the meaning, and "-cruciare" is related to "crux," meaning "cross" (referencing the instruments of torture).  Therefore, the word originally implied intense physical torture, but has evolved to encompass intense emotional or mental suffering as well.
