词源:

The term originates from cricket in the 19th century.  A bowler who took three wickets with three consecutive deliveries (balls) would be said to have achieved a "hat-trick".  The tradition was to reward the bowler with a new hat.  Over time, the term broadened to encompass any three consecutive achievements in various sports and even in other contexts.
