nondesistings:/ˌnɒn.dɪˈsɪstɪŋz/ | adj. | 不放弃的；坚持不懈的 |  The word "nondesistings" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a neologism or a misspelling.  There's no established meaning or usage in dictionaries or corpora. It seems to be formed by combining "non-" (not) and a word related to "desist" (to cease or stop).  Therefore, one could *infer* a meaning of "not ceasing," "persisting," or "unyielding," but this is purely speculative without context. |  No example sentences are possible as this is not a recognized word. | 近义词:  persistent, persevering, steadfast, unrelenting | 反义词:  yielding, ceasing, stopping | adj.
