WORD ORIGIN->

Desirablenesses is derived from the adjective "desirable," which in turn comes from the verb "desire."

* **Desire:**  Old French *desirer* (to desire), from Latin *desiderare* (to long for, wish for).  This Latin word itself is formed from *de-* (away, from) + *sidus* (star, constellation) referring to the feeling of longing for something that seems distant or unattainable, like a star in the sky.

* **Desirable:**  Adding the "-able" suffix to "desire" creates the adjective "desirable," meaning worthy of being desired.

* **Desirableness:** Adding the "-ness" suffix to "desirable" creates the noun "desirableness," meaning the quality of being desirable.

* **Desirablenesses:**  The plural form adds "-es" to indicate multiple desirable qualities.
