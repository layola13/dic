The word "mannerism" comes from the Middle English word "manerisme," which ultimately derives from the Old French "manierisme," meaning "the manner of doing something." The suffix "-ism" indicates a characteristic or doctrine.  The word's evolution reflects the increasing focus on individual style and expression.
