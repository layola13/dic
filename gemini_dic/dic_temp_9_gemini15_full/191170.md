词源:  The word "scaremongering" is a compound word.  "Scare" comes from the Old Norse word "skera," meaning to cut or shear,  which evolved to mean to frighten or terrify. "Mongering" comes from the Old English "mangian," meaning to mix or mingle, later developing the sense of trading or dealing in something. Therefore, "scaremongering" literally means "dealing in or spreading fear."
