词源:
The word "preascertainment" is a combination of:

* **pre-**:  A prefix meaning "before" or "prior to".
* **ascertain**:  A verb meaning "to find something out for certain; make sure of".  This verb itself derives from Old French "asseurer" (to assure) and ultimately from Latin "ad-" (to) + "secūrāre" (to make secure).


Therefore, preascertainment literally means "the act of finding something out for certain beforehand".
