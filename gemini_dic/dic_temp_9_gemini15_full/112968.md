词源:

The adverb "lukewarmly" derives directly from the adjective "lukewarm," which combines "luke" (meaning "tepid" or "moderately warm") and "warm."  The "luke" element traces back to Old English "hlūc," possibly related to the word "luke" meaning tepid.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner or way in which an action is performed.  Therefore, "lukewarmly" describes an action done with little warmth or enthusiasm.
