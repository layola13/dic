词源:
The word "hazardry" is derived from the Middle English word "hazard," which ultimately comes from the Arabic word "az-zahr," meaning "dice."  The association with dice reflects the element of chance and risk inherent in games of chance, and this sense of unpredictable danger evolved into the modern meaning.
