hypophosphoric: /ˌhaɪpəfɒsˈfɔːrɪk/ | adj. | 次磷酸的 | Relating to or denoting hypophosphorous acid or its salts.  Hypophosphoric acid is a weak acid with the formula H4P2O6. Its salts are called hypophosphites.  | The research focused on the synthesis of hypophosphoric acid derivatives.  这项研究集中在次磷酸衍生物的合成上。 |  phosphoric, phosphorous |  (No direct antonym, but "phosphoric" could be considered a contrasting term as it refers to a higher oxidation state of phosphorus.) |形容词
