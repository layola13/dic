词源：
The word "outsnatches" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "surpassing" or "exceeding") and the verb "snatch," meaning "to grasp or seize suddenly."  Therefore, "outsnatches" implies a more forceful and successful snatching compared to a simple "snatch."  The root of "snatch" is likely related to Old English and Germanic roots associated with seizing or catching.
