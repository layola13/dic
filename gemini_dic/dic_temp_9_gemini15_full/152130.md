pathotype:/ˈpæθəˌtaɪp/| n. |病原型，致病型|A pathotype is a distinct group of microorganisms within a species that are characterized by their specific pathogenic properties or the particular diseases they cause.  It refers to the specific type of disease caused by a particular strain or variant of a pathogen.  Different pathotypes may arise due to genetic variations within a species leading to differences in virulence, host range, or the type of disease produced.|Example:  The researchers identified three distinct pathotypes of the fungus causing wheat rust, each causing different symptoms and varying in aggressiveness.  = 研究人员鉴定了引起小麦锈病的真菌的三个不同病原型，每个病原型引起不同的症状，并且侵袭性也不同。|近义词：strain, variant, biotype|反义词：non-pathogenic type
