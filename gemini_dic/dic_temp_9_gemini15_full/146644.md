/ˌoʊvərˈhɑːdnəsɪz/ | n. |过度坚硬；过硬 |The word "overhardnesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a newly coined word formed by adding the prefix "over-" to "hardnesses".  "Hardness" refers to the quality of being hard, resistant to indentation or deformation. Adding "over-" suggests an excessive or extreme degree of hardness.  Therefore, "overhardnesses" would imply an excessive or unacceptable level of hardness in a material or situation.  There are no established synonyms or antonyms as it is not a recognized word.  Since it is not a standard word, providing usage examples, grammatical tenses, phrases, etc., is not feasible.  The word would need a specific context to understand its intended meaning.
