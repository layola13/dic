词源:
The word "damageability" is derived from the noun "damage" and the suffix "-ability," which indicates capacity or potential.  "Damage" itself comes from Old French *damage, from Old North French *dommage, from Vulgar Latin *damnum ("loss," "harm"), from Latin damnum ("loss", "damage").  The "-ability" suffix is a common English derivational suffix.
