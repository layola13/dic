diploblastic: /ˌdɪpləˈblæstɪk/ | adj. | 双胚层的 |  Having two primary germ layers, ectoderm and endoderm.  Animals with this type of embryonic development include jellyfish and corals.  They lack a mesoderm, the third germ layer found in triploblastic animals. |  The hydra is a diploblastic organism.  这种水螅是一种双胚层生物。 |  bidermal | triploblastic |


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The jellyfish is a diploblastic animal. = 水母是双胚层动物。
This organism exhibits diploblastic development. = 这种生物表现出双胚层发育。


一般过去时:
Scientists classified the creature as diploblastic. = 科学家将这种生物归类为双胚层生物。
The research confirmed its diploblastic nature. = 研究证实了它的双胚层特性。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified many diploblastic species. = 研究人员已经鉴定了许多双胚层物种。
We have learned much about diploblastic embryology. = 我们已经学习了很多关于双胚层胚胎学的知识。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, it was unknown if the species was diploblastic. = 在发现之前，人们不知道这个物种是否是双胚层生物。
They had already established the animal as diploblastic in previous studies. = 他们在之前的研究中已经确定该动物为双胚层生物。


将来时:
Future studies will explore the genetic basis of diploblastic development. = 未来的研究将探索双胚层发育的遗传基础。
Scientists will likely discover more diploblastic organisms in the deep sea. = 科学家们可能会在深海中发现更多双胚层生物。


虚拟语气:
If it were diploblastic, it would lack a mesoderm. = 如果它是双胚层的，它将缺乏中胚层。
I wish we had more information about the diploblastic lineage. = 我希望我们有更多关于双胚层谱系的信息。


被动语态:
The organism was classified as diploblastic based on its embryonic development. = 该生物根据其胚胎发育被归类为双胚层生物。
Many diploblastic species have been identified through microscopic analysis. = 通过显微分析已经鉴定了许多双胚层物种。


疑问句:
Is this animal diploblastic or triploblastic? = 这种动物是双胚层还是三胚层？
Are all cnidarians diploblastic? = 所有刺胞动物都是双胚层动物吗？


否定句:
This species is not diploblastic; it's triploblastic. = 这个物种不是双胚层的；它是三胚层的。
The results did not support the hypothesis that the organism was diploblastic. = 结果不支持该生物是双胚层的假设。


PHRASE->
diploblastic animals = 双胚层动物
diploblastic embryology = 双胚层胚胎学
diploblastic organization = 双胚层结构
diploblastic coelenterates = 双胚层腔肠动物
diploblastic development = 双胚层发育
