词源:

The word "gigantesque" is derived from the French word "gigantesque," which in turn comes from the Greek word "γίγας" (gigas), meaning "giant."  The suffix "-esque" is a common French and English suffix used to create adjectives that suggest resemblance or style.  Therefore, "gigantesque" literally means "giant-like" or "of giants."
