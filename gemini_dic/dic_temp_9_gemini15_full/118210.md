词源:  From Latin *mephitis, meaning "exhalation from the earth," "noxious vapor," or "foul smell."  This, in turn, is likely related to the Greek word μῦθος (mythos), meaning "myth" or "story," possibly suggesting a connection to the mythical, often dangerous, nature of such vapors.  The association with poisonous gases and foul smells cemented its meaning over time.
