词源：

* **self-**:  From Old English *self, *sylf, meaning "self, same."  This prefix indicates something done by or related to oneself.

* **entertaining**: From Old French *entreteigner, meaning "to hold between, entertain."  It ultimately derives from Latin *intertenēre,  "to hold between, keep occupied".  The modern sense of "providing amusement" evolved from the earlier meaning of "keeping someone occupied or engaged."
