词源:
The word "hyperlipidaemia" is a combination of three elements:

* **hyper-:**  From Greek ὑπέρ (hupér), meaning "over," "above," or "beyond."  It indicates an excessive or elevated level.
* **lipid-:** From Greek λίπος (lípos), meaning "fat."  Refers to fats and fatty substances in the body.
* **-aemia:** From Greek -αιμία (-aimía), meaning "blood condition."  Indicates a condition related to the blood.


Therefore, hyperlipidaemia literally means "a condition of excessive fat in the blood."
