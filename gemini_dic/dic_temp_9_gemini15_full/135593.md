词源：

The word is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "portentous," which derives from the Latin word "portentus," meaning "omen," "wonder," or "prodigious event."  Originally, "portentous" carried a sense of foreboding or awe-inspiring significance.  However, over time, it evolved to also mean pompous or self-important, suggesting a display of exaggerated importance or significance.  Therefore, "nonportentous" directly opposes this latter meaning.
