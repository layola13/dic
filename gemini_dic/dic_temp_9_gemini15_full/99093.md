PHRASE->
interbronchial space, interbronchial lymph nodes, interbronchial inflammation, interbronchial pressure, interbronchial communication


词源:

* **inter-**:  Prefix meaning "between" or "among."
* **bronch-**: From Greek "brongchos," meaning "windpipe" or "bronchus."
* **-ial**: Adjectival suffix.

Therefore, "interbronchial" literally means "relating to the space between the bronchi."
