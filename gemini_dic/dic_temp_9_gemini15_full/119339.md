PHRASE->
There are not common phrases directly using "microcalorimetric". The word is used to describe a specific technique or instrument.  Instead, phrases would use related terms like "microcalorimetry analysis," "microcalorimetric technique," etc.


Examples of phrases incorporating the concept:

Microcalorimetric study = 微量热研究
Microcalorimetric data analysis = 微量热数据分析
Microcalorimetric technique application = 微量热技术应用
High-sensitivity microcalorimetric measurement = 高灵敏度微量热测量
Isothermal microcalorimetric titration = 等温微量热滴定


Word Origin:

* **micro-:**  From Greek "mikros," meaning "small."
* **calor-:** From Latin "calor," meaning "heat."
* **-imetric:** From Greek "-metrikos," meaning "measuring."

Therefore, "microcalorimetric" literally means "relating to the measurement of small amounts of heat."
