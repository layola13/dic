cystidean:/sɪˈstɪdiən/| n. |海胆类动物|A cystidean is an extinct class of echinoderms that were common in the Paleozoic Era.  They were characterized by a sac-like body enclosed in calcareous plates, and lacked arms.  They are considered to be an early branch in the echinoderm evolutionary tree.|Example:  Fossil evidence suggests that cystideans thrived in shallow marine environments during the Ordovician period.  化石证据表明，海胆类动物在奥陶纪时期在浅海环境中繁盛。|近义词：echinoderm (broad term)|反义词：N/A
