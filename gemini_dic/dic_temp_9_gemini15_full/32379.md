The word "chilian" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (perhaps a place name or surname), or a word from a less common dialect or specialized field.  If you can provide more context, I might be able to offer a more informed response.
