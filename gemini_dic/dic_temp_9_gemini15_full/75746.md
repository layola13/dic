The word "fulls" does not exist as a standalone word in standard English.  It's likely a misspelling or a specific context-dependent term.  Therefore, a full lexical entry as requested is impossible.  To provide helpful information, I need clarification on the intended word.  Is it a plural of a word?  A typo? A technical term? Please provide more context.
