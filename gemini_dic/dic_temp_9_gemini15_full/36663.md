USAGE->
This word is a highly specialized term used primarily in entomology (the study of insects).  Therefore, demonstrating grammatical usage in the same way as a common word like "what" is not applicable.  The word itself doesn't participate in common grammatical structures like tense or voice in the same way.  Instead, its usage is descriptive, appearing within sentences that describe insect biology.

Example 1 (Simple Sentence): The larva produced copious colleterium.  (幼虫分泌了大量的粘液腺分泌物。)

Example 2 (Complex Sentence):  Researchers observed the unique chemical composition of the colleterium secreted by the newly discovered species. (研究人员观察了新发现物种分泌的粘液腺分泌物的独特化学成分。)


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly involving "colleterium" due to its specialized scientific nature.  Phrases would be contextual and dependent on the specific entomological context.  For example, one might find a phrase like "colleterium analysis" or "colleterium function" within a scientific paper.
