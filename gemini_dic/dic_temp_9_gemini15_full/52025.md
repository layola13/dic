dial-up: /ˈdaɪæl ʌp/ | n., v. |拨号上网；拨号连接|

英文解析：Dial-up refers to a type of Internet access that uses a modem to establish a connection to an Internet service provider (ISP) over a standard telephone line.  This method involves dialing a phone number and using a modem to modulate and demodulate signals, converting digital data into analog signals for transmission over the phone line, and vice versa. Dial-up internet is significantly slower than broadband connections like DSL or cable internet.
