kymograph:/ˈkaɪməɡræf/| n. |肌动描记器，描记器|A kymograph is a device used to record variations in a process over time.  It typically involves a rotating drum or cylinder covered with paper or other recording medium, upon which a writing stylus traces a line representing the process being measured.  Early kymographs were used to record physiological processes like heartbeats and muscle contractions.  Modern versions are often digital.|The scientist used a kymograph to record the changes in blood pressure.|oscillograph, recorder| (no direct antonym)|名词
