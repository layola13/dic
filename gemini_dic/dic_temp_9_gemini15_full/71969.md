词源:
The word "flimflammery" is derived from the verb "flimflam," which itself is of uncertain origin, possibly an onomatopoeia suggesting the sound of trickery or deception.  The suffix "-ery" adds a sense of habitual practice or activity.  Therefore, "flimflammeries" means multiple instances of deceptive or fraudulent activities.
