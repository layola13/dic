prefeudalism: /ˌpriːˈfjuːdəlɪzəm/ | n. | 封建制之前的时期 |  A social and political system that existed before the full development of feudalism, often characterized by decentralized power structures, a less rigid social hierarchy, and varying degrees of autonomy for different groups.  It's a period of transition and lacks the definitive characteristics of fully established feudalism.  The specific characteristics vary greatly depending on the time and place. |  The historical evidence suggests a gradual shift from prefeudalism to feudalism, rather than a sudden transformation.  | 近义词：proto-feudalism, early medieval period | 反义词：feudalism
