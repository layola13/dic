词源:
in- (否定前缀) + constancy (稳定性，忠诚)  Constancy itself comes from the Latin word *constantia*, meaning "firmness," "steadfastness," derived from *constans*, the present participle of *constare*, meaning "to stand together," "to be firm."  Therefore, inconstancy literally means "not steadfast" or "lacking firmness."
