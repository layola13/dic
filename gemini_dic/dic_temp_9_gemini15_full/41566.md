The word "corporas" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "corpus," "corpora," or a word with a similar phonetic sound?

2. **It's a technical term:**  It might be a term used in a very specific field (e.g., a niche area of linguistics, law, or medicine). If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it might help determine its meaning.

3. **It's a neologism or invented word:** It might be a newly coined word or a word invented for a particular purpose.

Without more information, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  If you can provide the source or context where you found "corporas," I can offer a more accurate response.
