词源:
The word "gossamered" is derived from "gossamer," which ultimately comes from the Middle English word "gosomer," possibly a combination of "goose" and "summer."  The original meaning referred to the fine cobwebs seen floating in the air during late summer, believed to be spun by geese.  The "-ed" suffix transforms the noun "gossamer" into an adjective, describing something possessing the qualities of gossamer.
