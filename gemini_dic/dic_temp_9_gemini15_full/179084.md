词源:
The word "redepreciated" is formed by combining the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") with the verb "depreciated" (meaning "reduced in value").  "Depreciate" itself originates from the Latin word "deprecari" meaning "to pray against,"  later evolving to imply lessening the value of something.
