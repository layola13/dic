The word "meccan" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There's no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specific jargon or dialect not widely recognized.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis.
