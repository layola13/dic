USAGE->
This word is an adverb, and therefore doesn't have verb conjugations like the example word "what".  It describes how something is done, specifically relating to routes of administration.  There is no tense or voice to conjugate.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "nonvenously".  The context always revolves around medical administration.  Phrases would instead involve the specific route used (e.g., "by subcutaneous injection," "orally administered").
