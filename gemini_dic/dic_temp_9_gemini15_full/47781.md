例句：The decanter sat elegantly on the mahogany table, reflecting the candlelight.  醒酒器优雅地摆放在红木桌子上，反射着烛光。


近义词：carafe (though carafe is more general and can refer to other liquids)|反义词：bottle (in the sense of not being decanted)|词性:名词


词源:The word "decanter" comes from the verb "decan," meaning "to pour off gently," which in turn comes from the Latin "decantare," a combination of "de-" (off, away) and "cantare" (to sing, to pour).  The original meaning implied a careful pouring to avoid disturbing sediment.
