词源:  The word "famously" is derived from the adjective "famous," which comes from the Old French word "famous," ultimately derived from the Latin word "famōsus," meaning "well-known," "renowned," or "celebrated."  The suffix "-ly" is an adverbial suffix, transforming the adjective "famous" into the adverb "famously."
