词源:

The word "sever" comes from the Old French word "severer," meaning "to cut off" or "separate." This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "severare," which has the same meaning.  The Latin root is "severus," meaning "serious," "strict," or "severe," which also contributes to the word's meaning of something being serious or extreme.
