nonprolificacies: /ˌnɒnˌprəʊlɪˈfɪsɪsiz/ | n. |  非多产；缺乏多产的事物 |  The word "nonprolificacies" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") with "prolificacies" (the plural of "prolificacy," meaning the state or quality of being prolific).  It refers to instances or situations of being unfruitful or unproductive.  There are no established usages or examples in standard dictionaries or corpora.  The word would be understood contextually, but its awkwardness suggests it should be replaced with clearer, more common phrasing. |  This sentence attempts to highlight the nonprolificacies of the current research methods. 这句话试图强调当前研究方法的缺乏多产。 |  unfruitfulness, sterility, barrenness, inactivity |  prolificacy, fertility, abundance, productivity | n.
