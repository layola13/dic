semimineral: /ˌsɛmiˈmɪnərəl/ | adj. | 半矿物的；部分矿物的 | Partially mineral; having some of the characteristics of a mineral.  Semimineral substances are typically composed of both organic and inorganic materials. They lack the complete crystalline structure and homogeneity found in true minerals. | Example: Coal is often considered a semimineral substance because it contains organic matter along with mineral components.  煤炭通常被认为是一种半矿物物质，因为它除了矿物成分外还含有有机物。| 近义词: submineral (less common) | 反义词:  mineral, fully mineral


USAGE->
This word is primarily used as an adjective, describing a substance. Therefore, grammatical tenses and moods are applied to the verbs used *with* the word, not to the word itself.  Examples will illustrate its usage in different sentence structures.


Simple Present: The rock sample contains several semimineral inclusions.  岩石样本包含几种半矿物包裹体。
Simple Past: Geologists identified the substance as semimineral in origin. 地质学家将该物质确定为半矿物成因。


Present Perfect: Scientists have recently discovered a new type of semimineral formation. 科学家最近发现了一种新型的半矿物构造。
Past Perfect:  Before the analysis, they had believed the material was a fully formed mineral. 分析之前，他们认为该物质是一种完全形成的矿物。


Future Simple:  Further research will determine the precise semimineral composition. 进一步的研究将确定精确的半矿物成分。
Future Perfect: By next year, they will have completed the study of semimineral deposits in the region. 到明年，他们将完成对该地区半矿物矿床的研究。


Conditional Sentences: If the material were entirely semimineral, it would behave differently under pressure. 如果该物质完全是半矿物，它在压力下会表现不同。
If the sample had been purely semimineral, the results would have been different. 如果样本是纯半矿物的，结果就会不同。
