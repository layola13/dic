词源:

The word "concordat" comes from the Late Latin word *concordātum*, the past participle of *concordārī*, meaning "to agree."  This in turn derives from the prefix *con-* (together) and *cordāre* (to agree, to be of one mind), related to the Latin word *cor* (heart).


用法说明:

Concordat typically refers to a formal agreement, often one with significant legal and political weight.  While it can refer to any formal agreement, its most common usage is in the context of agreements between the papacy and a secular government. These agreements often address matters such as the Church's jurisdiction, the appointment of clergy, and the Church's property rights within the secular government's territory.
