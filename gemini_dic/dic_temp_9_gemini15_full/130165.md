词源:

The word "non-retroactive" is a compound word.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not,"  "retro-" is a prefix derived from the Latin "retro" meaning "backward" or "back," and "-active" is an adjective suffix meaning "having the power to act." Therefore, non-retroactive literally means "not acting backward" or "not applying to the past."
