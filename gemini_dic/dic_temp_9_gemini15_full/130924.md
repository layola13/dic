词源:

The word "nonascetic" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "ascetic".  "Ascetic" comes from the Late Latin word *asceticus*, which in turn derives from the Greek word *askētēs* (ἀσκητής), meaning "one who exercises," "practitioner," or "athlete."  This Greek term referred to those who engaged in rigorous self-discipline, often for religious reasons.  The meaning evolved to encompass the modern understanding of an ascetic lifestyle characterized by abstinence from worldly pleasures.


用法说明:

"Nonascetic" is used to describe individuals, lifestyles, or practices that are the opposite of ascetic.  It emphasizes the enjoyment of sensual pleasures and material comforts, often in contrast to a life of self-denial and austerity.  The term is typically used in a descriptive or comparative manner to highlight the difference between two contrasting ways of life.

例句:

1.  His nonascetic habits included fine dining, lavish parties, and expensive clothes. = 他的非禁欲生活方式包括精致的餐饮、奢华的派对和昂贵的衣服。

2.  The artist's nonascetic lifestyle fueled his creative energy, though some critics questioned its impact on his work's integrity. = 艺术家的非禁欲生活方式激发了他的创造力，尽管一些评论家质疑它对其作品完整性的影响。
