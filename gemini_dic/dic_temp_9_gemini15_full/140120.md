off-side: /ˈɒfˈsaɪd/ | /ˈɔːfˈsaɪd/ | adj. |越位的；不合法的|  In sports, particularly soccer (football), being in an off-side position means a player is closer to the opponent's goal line than both the ball and the second-to-last defender when the ball is played to them.  This is a violation of the rules.  More broadly, it can refer to anything that is out of place, inappropriate, or against the rules. |例句：The referee called the player off-side.  裁判判罚球员越位。

The striker was caught offside. 前锋被判越位。
