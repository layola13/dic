用法说明：

Recusancy is primarily a historical term, often used in the context of the English Reformation and the penal laws against Catholics who refused to attend the Church of England services. While it can be used more broadly to describe any act of defiance or refusal to comply, its strongest association remains with religious nonconformity in 16th and 17th century England.
