词源:

The word "gallstones" is a compound word.  "Gall" comes from Old English *gealla, meaning "bile," referencing the gallbladder where the stones form.  "Stones" is the plural of "stone," a common word referring to a hard mineral object.  Therefore, "gallstones" literally means "stones in the gallbladder."
