词源:
The word "eager" ultimately derives from the Old English word "ēager," meaning "sharp," "keen," or "sour."  This sense of sharpness evolved to imply a keenness of mind or spirit, leading to the modern meaning of intense desire or enthusiasm.  The connection is subtle but reflects the intensity associated with both the original and modern meanings.
