词源:
The word "nippy" (from which "nippier" is derived) likely comes from the Middle English word "nippen," meaning "to nip" or "to bite."  This suggests a quick, sharp action. Over time, the meaning shifted to describe something quick, lively, and brisk, especially in relation to cold weather (a "nippy" day being a cold day). The "-ier" suffix adds the comparative degree, making "nippier" mean "more nippy."
