词源:

The word "remembrances" comes from the Old French word "remembraunce," which itself derives from the Latin word "rememoratio," meaning "a recalling to mind."  The prefix "re-" means "again," "back," or "repeatedly," while "memoratio" relates to "memory."  Therefore, the core meaning has always been connected to the act of remembering.
