词源:
The word "hangbird" is a compound word formed from "hang" (meaning to suspend) and "bird".  It's a descriptive term based on the bird's nesting behavior, not a formally recognized taxonomic term.  The etymology of "hang" traces back to Proto-Germanic and ultimately to Proto-Indo-European roots related to bending or suspending.
