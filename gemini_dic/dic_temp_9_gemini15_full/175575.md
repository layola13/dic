词源:
The word "randomised" is derived from the adjective "random," which ultimately traces back to the Old French word "randon," meaning "swift course, gallop," which itself is of uncertain origin.  The "-ised" suffix indicates the past participle of the verb "to randomise," transforming something into a random state.  The modern use of "random" and its derivatives evolved from its older meaning of "without aim or direction" to the now prevalent statistical and computational usage.
