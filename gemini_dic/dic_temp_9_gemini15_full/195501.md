The term "semipagan" is a relatively modern descriptor, not found in historical texts. It's a compound word formed from "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partially") and "pagan."  The etymology of "pagan" traces back to the Latin word *paganus*, originally referring to a "country dweller" or "rustic." In the late Roman Empire, the term became associated with those who remained outside the Christian faith, often implying a connection to pre-Christian religious traditions.  Over time, it has evolved to encompass a wide range of polytheistic and nature-based spiritualities.
