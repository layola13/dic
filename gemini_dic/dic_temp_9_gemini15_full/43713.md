词源:  The word "creditworthy" is a compound word formed from "credit" and "worthy."  "Credit" comes from the Old French word "crede," meaning "belief" or "trust," ultimately deriving from the Latin "credere," meaning "to believe."  "Worthy" comes from the Old English "weorþig," meaning "deserving of honor or respect."  Therefore, "creditworthy" literally means "deserving of credit" or "worthy of trust."
