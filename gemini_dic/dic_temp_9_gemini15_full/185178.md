词源:
The word "retort" comes from the Middle French word "retorter," meaning "to twist back," which itself is derived from the Latin word "retorquere," with the same meaning.  The original sense referred to the twisting back of a vessel's neck in a chemical process, which evolved into the current meaning of a sharp verbal response.
