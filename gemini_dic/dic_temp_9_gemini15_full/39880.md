词源:

The word "constituencies" is the plural of "constituency".  "Constituency" comes from the Middle English word "constituencie," derived from the Old French "constituencie" and ultimately from the Latin "constituentia," meaning "the act of constituting or establishing."  The Latin root "constituere" means "to set up, establish, compose."  Therefore, the core meaning relates to the people who make up a group or body, specifically in a political context.
