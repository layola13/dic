USAGE->
This word, "seemlyhed," is not a standard English word.  Therefore, providing grammatical examples in different tenses is impossible.  The word appears to be a neologism or a misspelling.  It might be intended to be a combination of "seemly" (meaning appropriate or proper) and "hood" (meaning state or quality), implying a state of seeming propriety or plausibility.  However, it lacks established usage.


PHRASE->
N/A (as the word is not established)
