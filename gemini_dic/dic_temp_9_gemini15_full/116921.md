词源:
The word "mayorship" is derived from "mayor" + "-ship," a suffix used to denote a position, office, or status.  "Mayor" itself has origins in the Old French "maire," ultimately from the Latin "maior," meaning "greater" or "elder," reflecting the mayor's role as a leading figure in the community.
