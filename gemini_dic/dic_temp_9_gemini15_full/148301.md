词源:

The word "oversolemn" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the adjective "solemn" (meaning "formal and dignified; serious").  "Solemn" itself originates from Old French "solennel," ultimately derived from Latin "solennis," which is related to "solus" (alone) and possibly implied a ceremonial occasion where things were done in a formal and serious way.
