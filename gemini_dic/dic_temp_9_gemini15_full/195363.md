semimanufacturings:/ˌsɛmiˌmænjuˈfæktʃərɪŋz/| n.|半成品制造业；半成品加工|The term "semimanufacturings" refers to the processes and industries involved in partially completing the manufacturing of goods.  These processes typically fall between the extraction of raw materials and the final production of finished goods.  Semimanufacturing often involves transforming raw materials into intermediate products that will later be used in the creation of final consumer goods.  For example, steel production is a semimanufacturing process; the steel itself is not a finished product, but rather a component used in countless other manufactured goods. |The textile industry relies heavily on semimanufacturings to produce fabrics.|近义词：intermediate manufacturing, partial manufacturing|反义词：finished goods manufacturing, primary production|
