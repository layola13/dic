miscollocation:/ˌmɪskəˈloʊkeɪʃən/ | n. | 词语搭配错误 | The use of words together that are not normally used together, resulting in an unnatural or incorrect phrase.  This often occurs when a learner of a language tries to directly translate from their native language. | Example: "The report highlights the *serious* problem of *light* pollution." (While "serious problem" is fine, "light pollution" is usually not described as serious, but rather as a problem of brightness or visibility.) | 近义词：incorrect word combination, inappropriate word choice | 反义词：correct collocation, appropriate word choice |  词性：名词


USAGE->
This word is a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "what".  The usage focuses on identifying and correcting instances of miscollocation.

Example 1:  Identifying a miscollocation: "The author's *sharp* prose was *dull* and uninteresting."  The words "sharp" and "dull" are miscollocated because they are antonyms, and typically one wouldn't use them together to describe the same thing.

Example 2: Correcting a miscollocation: The original sentence: "He made a *rapid* decision to *slowly* leave." The corrected sentence: "He made a *quick* decision to leave."  "Rapid" and "slowly" are miscollocated.  "Quick" is a better fit for a quick decision.


PHRASE->
There aren't common set phrases using "miscollocation" as it's a technical term.  Instead, its usage is within discussions of linguistics, writing, and language learning.
