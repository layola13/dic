词源:
The word "fop" entered English in the late 17th century. It's believed to be a shortening of the word "fopdoodle," a term of uncertain origin which likely combined "fop" (of uncertain origin, possibly onomatopoeic)  with "doodle," meaning a simpleton or fool.  The meaning evolved to specifically refer to a man excessively concerned with his appearance and fashion.
