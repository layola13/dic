debuggability:/ˌdiːbʌɡəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可调试性 | The ease with which a program or system can be debugged.  It refers to the characteristics of a system that make it easy to find and fix errors.  High debuggability is a desirable quality in software engineering. | Example:  The modular design of the software significantly improved its debuggability.  软件的模块化设计显著提高了它的可调试性。  |近义词:  testability, maintainability | 反义词:  unmaintainability, opacity |
