词源:

The word "rejectingly" is derived from the verb "reject," which comes from the Old French word "rejeter," meaning "to throw back."  The suffix "-ingly" transforms the adjective "rejecting" (itself derived from "reject") into an adverb, indicating the manner in which an action is performed.


USAGE->  (Since rejectingly is an adverb,  tense conjugation is not applicable. The tense applies to the verb it modifies.)
