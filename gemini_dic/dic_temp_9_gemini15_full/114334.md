词源:
The word "maize" comes from Spanish *maíz*, which in turn originates from the Taíno word *mahiz*.  The Taíno were the indigenous people of the Caribbean islands, and they were the first to cultivate maize.  It subsequently spread throughout the Americas and the world.  In some parts of the world, notably North America, the term "corn" is used interchangeably with "maize," although technically "corn" refers to any cereal grain.
