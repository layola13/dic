词源:
The word "dious" ultimately derives from the Old French word "deios," meaning "divine," "godly," or "sacred."  However, over time, its meaning shifted dramatically, likely due to ironic or sarcastic usage. The modern meaning of "dious" is the exact opposite of its original meaning. The shift in meaning likely happened through a process of semantic bleaching and then pejoration, where the word lost its original positive connotation and acquired a negative one.
