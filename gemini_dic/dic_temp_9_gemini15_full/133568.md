词源:  The word is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "flagrance," which derives from the French word "flagrance," meaning "flagrant,"  ultimately from the Latin word "flagrans," present participle of "flagro," meaning "to burn" or "to blaze."  The sense of "burning" evolved into "obvious," "conspicuous," and then "flagrant" (in the sense of obviously wrong or wicked).
