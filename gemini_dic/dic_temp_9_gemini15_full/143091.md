词源:  The word "outbreast" is a relatively uncommon word formed by combining the prefix "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent than") with the noun "breast," referring to the chest or a prominent part.  While the exact historical development is difficult to trace definitively due to its infrequent use, its meaning is logically derived from the sense of surpassing someone or something in a forceful or prominent way, as if pushing past them with one's chest.
