self-repellency:/selfrɪˈpɛlənsɪ/| n. |自排斥性，自相斥性 |The tendency of a substance or organism to repel itself or its own kind.  This is often observed in physical phenomena, where like charges repel each other, or in biological contexts, where organisms may exhibit territorial behavior or avoid overcrowding. |Example: The self-repellency of the particles prevented them from aggregating.  自相斥的粒子阻止了它们的聚集。|近义词:autorepulsion, self-avoidance|反义词:self-attraction, aggregation|


USAGE->
