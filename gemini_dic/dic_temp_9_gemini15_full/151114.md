词源:
parasitize comes from the word parasite, which itself is derived from the Late Latin word *parasitus, meaning "one who eats at another's table," from Greek *parasitos, from *para- "beside, alongside" + *sitos "food, grain, meal."  The suffix "-ize" is a verb-forming suffix of Greek origin, meaning "to make, to become."
