The word "nonarticulatenesses" is a relatively rare and complex word.  It's a noun formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to the adjective "nonarticulate." Let's break it down:

* **Non-**: This is a prefix meaning "not."
* **Articulate**: This adjective means "able to speak clearly and effectively," or "expressed clearly and effectively."  It comes from the Latin word "articulatus," meaning "jointed," referring to the joining of sounds in speech.

Therefore, "nonarticulate" means "unable to speak clearly and effectively," or "not expressed clearly and effectively."

Adding "-nesses" transforms the adjective into a plural noun, indicating multiple instances of nonarticulation or lack of clear expression.  The word suggests a multiplicity of unclear or indistinct communications or expressions.


**USAGE->**

This word, due to its complexity, is not used in common everyday speech or writing.  Its usage would likely be found in academic or highly specialized contexts where the nuances of unclear communication are being discussed. Therefore, providing example sentences using the full range of grammatical tenses is impractical and unnatural.  The following example focuses on the simple present tense and shows the word in a context where it might appear:

**Simple Present:**

The professor noted several nonarticulatenesses in the student's essay, highlighting the need for clearer expression of ideas.  教授指出学生论文中有多处表达不清之处，强调需要更清晰地表达思想。


**Simple Past:**

The committee's report was filled with nonarticulatenesses, rendering its conclusions ambiguous. 委员会的报告充满了含糊不清之处，使其结论模棱两可。



There are no common phrases using "nonarticulatenesses."  The word itself is too specific and rarely used to have established common collocations.
