用法说明：

Separable is primarily used as an adjective, modifying nouns to indicate the possibility of separation.  It's frequently used in technical contexts, such as engineering or grammar, but can also appear in more general contexts.  It suggests a clean and relatively uncomplicated division, not necessarily a forceful or violent one.
