词源：
The word "relish" ultimately comes from the Old French "relescher," meaning "to lick up," or "to relish."  This, in turn,  has roots in the Vulgar Latin "re- + *lachiare," a combination of the prefix "re-" (again) and a root related to "licking."  The transition from "licking" to the modern sense of enjoying something greatly is a semantic shift over time.
