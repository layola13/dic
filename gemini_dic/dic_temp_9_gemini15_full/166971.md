The word "prestruggles" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a complete analysis following your requested format is impossible.  There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries or corpora.


To help, if you meant a different word or have a specific context in mind where you encountered "prestruggles," please provide more information.  I can then offer analysis of a similar-sounding or contextually relevant word.
