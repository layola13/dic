词源:

The noun "dish" ultimately derives from Old English *disc, meaning "plate" or "dish," which itself is of Germanic origin.  The verb sense of "dish" (to wash dishes) is a later development, directly related to the noun's primary meaning.  The sense of "to get rid of something" is a more figurative extension of this, implying a removal or disposal akin to clearing dishes from a table.
