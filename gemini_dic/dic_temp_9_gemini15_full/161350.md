词源:
The word "postredemption" is a compound word formed from the prefix "post-" (meaning "after") and the noun "redemption" (meaning "the action of saving or being saved from sin, error, or evil").  Therefore, its meaning is literally "after redemption."  The root of "redemption" traces back to Latin *redemere, from *re- (again) + *emere (to take, buy).  The sense evolved from buying back something previously lost to freeing someone from bondage or sin.
