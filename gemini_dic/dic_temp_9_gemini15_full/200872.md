词源:  Derived from "sling," meaning to throw or cast something, or a device for throwing. The "-ly" suffix transforms the noun/verb into an adverb, indicating a manner of movement or action resembling the movement of a sling.  The sense evolved from the physical action of a sling to a more figurative sense of loose or careless movement.
