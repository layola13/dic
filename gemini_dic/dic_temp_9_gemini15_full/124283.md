词源:
The word "mothballing" originates from the use of naphthalene mothballs (small balls of a chemical compound) to protect clothes and other fabrics from moths.  The process of storing items with mothballs to prevent insect damage eventually led to the figurative use of the word to describe the temporary cessation of activity or the storing of something for a later time.
