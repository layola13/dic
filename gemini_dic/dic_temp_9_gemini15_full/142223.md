ornithosauria:/ˌɔːrnɪθəˈsɔːriə/| n. |鸟龙类|A clade (a group of organisms believed to have evolved from a common ancestor) of extinct flying reptiles that lived during the Mesozoic Era (252 to 66 million years ago).  They are characterized by their lightweight skeletons, hollow bones, and large wings formed by a membrane stretched between the body and a greatly elongated fourth finger. Ornithosauria includes pterosaurs, which were not dinosaurs but closely related.  |Example: The discovery of a new *Ornithosauria* fossil sheds light on the evolution of flight.  鸟龙类新化石的发现揭示了飞行进化之谜。|近义词: pterosaur (though not strictly synonymous, as Ornithosauria is a broader clade)|反义词:None|
