endodermal:/ˌɛndoʊˈdɜːrməl/| adj.|内胚层的；内胚叶的 | Relating to the endoderm, the innermost of the three primary germ layers of an embryo.  The endoderm develops into the lining of the digestive and respiratory systems and other internal organs. | Example: The endodermal cells differentiate to form the lining of the gut. 内胚层细胞分化形成肠道的内衬。|近义词：entodermal |反义词：ectodermal, mesodermal
