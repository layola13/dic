kilovolt:/ˈkɪləʊvɒlt/ | n. |千伏|A kilovolt (kV) is a unit of electrical potential difference (voltage) equal to one thousand volts.  It's used to measure high voltages in electrical systems and equipment.  |例句：The high-voltage power line carries electricity at 220 kilovolts. 这条高压输电线以220千伏的电压输送电力。
The transformer steps up the voltage to several kilovolts. 变压器将电压升高到几千伏。|近义词：thousand volts|反义词：millivolt


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The power line carries 10 kilovolts. = 这条电线输送10千伏电力。
This system operates at a kilovolt level. = 这个系统在千伏级别运行。

一般过去时:
The voltage dropped to 5 kilovolts. = 电压下降到5千伏。
The experiment used 100 kilovolts. = 实验使用了100千伏电压。

现在完成时:
We have measured voltages up to 100 kilovolts. = 我们已经测量了高达100千伏的电压。
The system has consistently operated at 220 kilovolts. = 该系统一直以220千伏的电压运行。

过去完成时:
The equipment had already reached 5 kilovolts before the alarm sounded. = 警报响起前设备已经达到5千伏。
They had tested the circuit at various kilovolt levels. = 他们已经在不同的千伏级别测试了电路。

将来时:
The new power plant will generate electricity at 500 kilovolts. = 新电厂将以500千伏的电压发电。
We will increase the voltage to 1 kilovolt for the next test. = 下一次测试我们将电压提高到1千伏。

虚拟语气:
If the voltage were higher than 10 kilovolts, the equipment would be damaged. = 如果电压高于10千伏，设备将损坏。
I wish we had a device capable of measuring kilovolts. = 我希望我们有一台能够测量千伏的设备。

被动语态:
The voltage is controlled by a sophisticated system. = 电压由一个复杂的系统控制。
The experiment was conducted using 10 kilovolts. = 实验是用10千伏电压进行的。

疑问句:
What is the kilovolt rating of this transformer? = 这个变压器的千伏额定值是多少？
Does the system operate at high kilovolts? = 这个系统是否在高千伏下运行？

否定句:
The voltage did not exceed 1 kilovolt. = 电压没有超过1千伏。
The equipment is not designed to handle kilovolts. = 这台设备并非设计用于处理千伏电压。


PHRASE->
high kilovolts  高千伏
kilovolt range 千伏范围
kilovolt level 千伏等级
kilovolt peak 千伏峰值
kilovolt-ampere 千伏安
