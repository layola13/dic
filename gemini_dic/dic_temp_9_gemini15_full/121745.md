词源:
The word "misproposing" is formed by adding the prefix "mis-" (meaning wrong, bad, or wrongly) to the verb "proposing". "Proposing" comes from the Old French "proposer" and ultimately from the Latin "proponere," which means "to put forward," "to offer," or "to suggest."  Therefore, "misproposing" literally means "wrongly putting forward" or "making a bad proposal."
