词源:  The word "mistake" originates from the Old English "mis-tacan," which literally means "to mis-take," or "to take wrongly." The prefix "mis-" indicates a wrong or faulty action, and "taken" refers to the act of understanding or grasping something. Over time, the verb "mistake" evolved into the noun "mistake," representing the outcome of a wrong action or understanding.
