nonuniqueness:/ˌnɒnjuːˈniːknəs/ | n. |不唯一性，非唯一性 |The state or quality of not being unique; the existence of multiple solutions or possibilities.  This concept is often encountered in mathematics, computer science, and other fields where a single, definitive solution is not guaranteed. For example, in some mathematical problems, there might be multiple solutions that satisfy the given conditions, thus exhibiting nonuniqueness.|例句：The nonuniqueness of the solution to this differential equation makes it challenging to find a specific answer.  这个微分方程的解的不唯一性使得寻找特定答案具有挑战性。

The nonuniqueness of the equilibrium point implies that multiple stable states are possible. 平衡点的非唯一性意味着多种稳定状态是可能的。|近义词：multiplicity, ambiguity, plurality |反义词：uniqueness
