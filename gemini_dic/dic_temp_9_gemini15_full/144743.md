词源:

The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great degree) and "assertive" (meaning having or showing a confident and forceful personality).  "Assertive" itself comes from the verb "assert," ultimately from Latin *ad- ("to") + *serere ("to join, connect, bind").  The sense of "to declare or state positively" developed later.
