PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "inabstracted".  The word itself is quite uncommon and usually used directly as an adjective modifying a noun.  Instead, phrases expressing similar concepts are used:

词源:
The word "inabstracted" is formed by adding the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") to the word "abstracted".  "Abstracted" derives from the verb "abstract," ultimately from Latin *abstractus, the past participle of *abstrahere, meaning "to draw away," from *ab- ("away") + *trahere ("to draw").  Therefore, "inabstracted" means "not drawn away from the concrete," or "concrete," "specific," etc.
