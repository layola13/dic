WORD ORIGIN->

Execrableness derives from the word "execrable," which comes from the Latin word "exsecrabilis."  "Ex" means "out" or "from," "se" means "apart," and "crabrare" means "to curse" or "to detest."  Therefore, "exsecrabilis" literally means "to be cursed" or "to be detested."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "execrable" into the noun "execrableness," signifying the quality or state of being execrable.
