extrudabilities:/ɪkˈstruːdəˈbɪlətiz/| n. |挤出能力，可挤出性 |The ability of a material to be extruded.  This refers to how easily a material can be shaped by forcing it through a die.  Factors influencing extrudability include the material's viscosity, temperature, and the design of the extrusion equipment.|例句：The high extrudabilities of this polymer allow for the production of complex shapes.  这种聚合物的良好挤出能力允许生产复杂的形状。

The improved extrudabilities of the new formulation resulted in higher production rates. 新配方的改进挤出能力导致更高的生产率。|近义词：formability, moldability|反义词：unworkability, brittleness

PHRASE->
extrudability test = 挤出能力测试
improved extrudability = 改善的挤出能力
high extrudability = 高挤出能力
extrudability of polymers = 聚合物的挤出能力
measuring extrudability = 测量挤出能力

词源:
The word "extrudabilities" is derived from the verb "extrude," which comes from the Latin word "extrudere," meaning "to thrust out" or "to push out."  The suffix "-abilities" indicates the capacity or potential for being extruded.
