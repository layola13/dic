词源:

The word "nontemperateness" is a combination of:

* **non-**: a prefix meaning "not" or "lack of".
* **temperateness**:  referring to the quality of being temperate, meaning moderate, calm, or stable.  This, in turn, derives from the word "temperate," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "temperātus," the past participle of "temperāre," meaning "to moderate, temper, or mix."

用法说明:

"Nontemperateness" is a relatively uncommon word, primarily used in formal contexts when discussing aspects of climate or personality traits. It emphasizes the absence of moderation or stability.  It's less frequently used than words like "instability" or "volatility," which offer more concise alternatives in most situations.
