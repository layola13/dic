isolectic: /ˌaɪsoʊˈlɛktɪk/ | adj. | 等电的 |  Referring to a point at which the net electrical charge of a molecule is zero.  This is typically achieved by adjusting the pH of a solution to match the isoelectric point of the molecule.  The term is often used in biochemistry and related fields. | The isoelectric point of a protein can be determined experimentally.  等电点可以实验测定蛋白质。|近义词：isopotential (in some contexts)|反义词：None directly opposite, but terms describing charged states would be antonyms in context (e.g., positively charged, negatively charged) |形容词

USAGE->
