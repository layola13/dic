labiovelars:/ˌleɪbiˈoʊvɛlɑːrz/| n. |唇齿音|Labiovelars are sounds produced with both lip and velum articulations.  They are a type of consonant sound in phonetics where the sound is created by bringing the lips together (labial) and raising the back of the tongue towards the soft palate (velar) simultaneously.  This creates a combination of lip and velum constriction.  Examples include the sounds represented by the letters "w" and "gw" (as in "qu").|The English "w" sound, as in "wet," is a labiovelar approximant.  The "qu" sound in "quick" is a labiovelar affricate.|近义词: bilabial, velar |反义词: None (It's a descriptive term, not something that has opposites in the same way as positive/negative adjectives).
