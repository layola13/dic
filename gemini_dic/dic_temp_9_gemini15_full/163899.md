词源:
The word "predetain" is a relatively modern coinage, formed by adding the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") to the verb "detain."  "Detain" itself comes from the Old French word "detenir,"  meaning "to hold back," which ultimately derives from the Latin "detinere," composed of "de-" (away) and "tenere" (to hold).  Therefore, "predetain" literally means "to hold back before."
