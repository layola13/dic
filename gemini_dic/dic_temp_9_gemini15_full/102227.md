I cannot provide a detailed analysis of the word "{itely}" following your requested format because "{itely}" is not a complete English word.  It's a fragment.  To provide the requested analysis, I need a complete, valid English word.

If you meant a word containing "itely" as a suffix or part of a word, please provide the full word. For example, if you meant "definitely," "politely," or "immediately," I can then provide the requested information.
