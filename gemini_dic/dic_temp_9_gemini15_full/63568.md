词源:

The word "enviousness" is derived from the adjective "envious," which itself comes from the Old French word "envieux," meaning "envious, jealous."  This in turn has roots in the Latin word "invidia," meaning "envy," which is composed of the prefix "in-" (meaning "in," "on," or "against") and "vidēre" (meaning "to see").  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality.
