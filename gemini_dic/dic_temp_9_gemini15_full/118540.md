mesologarithm: /ˌmɛzoʊˈlɒɡərɪðəm/ | n. | 中数对数 | A mesologarithm is a mathematical function related to logarithms, specifically designed for use with values close to 1.  It's defined as  m(x) = log₂(1+x) for x close to 0. This function simplifies calculations involving small changes around a base value of 1.  It's less commonly used than standard logarithms.  | The mesologarithm simplifies calculations in certain scientific and engineering applications where values are close to unity. | 近义词: (No direct synonym, as it's a specialized function) | 反义词: (No direct antonym) | 名词
