kremlins:/ˈkrɛmlɪnz/| n.|克里姆林宫（复数）|The Kremlin, in its various forms and contexts, refers to the historic fortified complex at the heart of Moscow, Russia, and, by extension, to the Russian government or its leadership.  The word itself is derived from the Slavic word "kremlin," meaning "fortress" or "citadel."  The plural form "kremlins" is used when referring to multiple such fortified complexes, although this is less common as there is only one in Moscow that holds primary significance. |例句：Some people associate the actions of the Russian government with the whims of the Kremlins.  一些人将俄罗斯政府的行为与克里姆林宫的反复无常联系起来。

例句：Historically, several Russian cities boasted their own Kremlins, each a symbol of regional power.历史上，俄罗斯的几个城市都拥有自己的克里姆林宫，每个都是地区权力的象征。


近义词：citadels, fortresses, castles (in a broader sense)
