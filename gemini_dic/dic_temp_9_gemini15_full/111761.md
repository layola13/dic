词源:
The word "lodge" comes from Old English *logian, meaning "to lie, rest, or dwell". It is related to Old Norse *log, meaning "fire," suggesting an original sense of shelter or resting place near a fire.  The modern meanings have evolved over time, retaining connections to shelter, temporary residence, and formal submission.
