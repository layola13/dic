词源:
The verb "regard" comes from the Old French word "regarder," meaning "to look at," "to observe," or "to consider."  This, in turn, has roots in the Germanic "gerada," meaning "straight" or "direct," reflecting the idea of looking directly at something.  The "as" is a simple preposition indicating the object of the regard.
