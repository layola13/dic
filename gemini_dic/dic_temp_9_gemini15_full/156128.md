photostimulation:/ˌfoʊtoʊˌstɪmjʊˈleɪʃən/ | n. | 光刺激；光照刺激 | The process of stimulating cells or tissues using light.  It's used in various fields, including medicine and biology, to trigger specific cellular responses. For example, in optogenetics, photostimulation is used to control the activity of neurons using light-sensitive proteins. | Example:  Photostimulation of the retina can improve visual function in some patients. 光刺激视网膜可以改善某些患者的视觉功能。


Example: Researchers are exploring the use of photostimulation to treat neurological disorders. 研究人员正在探索利用光刺激治疗神经系统疾病。 | 近义词: light stimulation, optical stimulation | 反义词:  light inhibition (抑制)
