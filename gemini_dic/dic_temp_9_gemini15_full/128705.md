The word "nidulite" is not found in standard English dictionaries or geological databases.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a technical term from a very specialized field, or a proper noun.  To provide the requested information, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (A book, article, website, conversation?)
* **What is the subject matter?** (Geology, biology, literature, etc.?)


Without this information, I cannot provide the pronunciation, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc.
