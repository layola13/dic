pseudostella: /ˌsuːdəʊˈstɛlə/ | n. | 假恒星，拟恒星 | A pseudostella is an astronomical object that superficially resembles a star but is not one.  It might be a galaxy that appears star-like due to its distance or a very distant quasar. The term is rarely used in modern astronomy, often superseded by more specific classifications. | Example:  The distant object was initially classified as a pseudostella, but further observation revealed it to be a distant galaxy.  = 遥远的天体最初被归类为假恒星，但进一步的观测表明它是一个遥远的星系。| 近义词: quasi-star, star-like object | 反义词: true star, actual star | 名词
