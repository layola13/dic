词源:

The word "particularness" is derived from the adjective "particular," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "particulier," meaning "belonging to a part, separate, individual."  This in turn traces back to the Latin word "particularis," formed from "particula," meaning "a small part."  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix used to form nouns denoting a quality or state.


用法说明:

"Particularness" typically refers to the quality of being specific, detailed, or precise.  However, it can also carry a negative connotation, suggesting an excessive focus on minor details or a tendency to be overly picky or fastidious.  The context is crucial in determining the intended meaning.
