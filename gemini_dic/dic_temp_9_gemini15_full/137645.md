Etymology:

The word "nonunanimously" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adverb "unanimously".  "Unanimously" itself comes from "unanimous," which derives from the Latin words "unus" (one) and "animus" (mind, spirit).  Therefore, "unanimously" means "with one mind," or with complete agreement.  Adding "non-" creates the opposite meaning.
