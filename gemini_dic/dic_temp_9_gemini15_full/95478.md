词源:
The word "incivility" comes from the Latin word "civis," meaning "citizen," and the prefix "in-," meaning "not."  Therefore, "incivility" literally means "not being a good citizen" in terms of social behavior.  It evolved through the Old French "civile" (civil) and the Middle English "civilete" (civility) before reaching its modern form.
