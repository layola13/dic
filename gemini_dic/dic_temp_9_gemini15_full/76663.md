词源:
The word "galvanise" ultimately derives from the name of Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), an Italian physician and physicist.  Galvani's experiments with frog legs led to the discovery of bioelectricity, and the term "galvanism" (referring to the effects of electricity on living tissue) was coined in his honor.  The word later expanded to include the broader meaning of stimulating or exciting into action.  The use of "galvanise" to refer to the process of coating metal with zinc to protect it from corrosion is a later development, but still related to the original meaning through the association of electricity with a protective process.
