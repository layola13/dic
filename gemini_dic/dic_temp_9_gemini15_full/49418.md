The word "dellie" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  If you can provide more context (e.g., a sentence where you saw it, the topic it relates to), I may be able to help you find the correct word.

2. **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a name (person, place, or thing) or a brand name.

3. **It's a slang term or regional dialect word:** Its meaning would be limited to a specific group or area.

4. **It's a newly coined word:**  New words are constantly entering the language.

Without further information, I cannot provide the requested analysis. Please provide more context.
