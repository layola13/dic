The word "caravette" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "corvette" or "caravel."

2. **A neologism or proper noun:** A newly coined word or a name specific to a particular context (like a brand name).  More information is needed to understand its meaning.

Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, translation, explanation, examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical usages as requested in the format.  Please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
