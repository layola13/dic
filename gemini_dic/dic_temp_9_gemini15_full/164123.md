predispersions:/ˌpriːdɪsˈpɜːrʒənz/| n. |预分散；预分散体|A predispersion is a mixture of a solid material and a liquid that is prepared before the material is dispersed in a larger volume of liquid.  It's often used to improve the efficiency and uniformity of the final dispersion.  This is frequently done to prevent clumping or agglomeration of the solid particles. |例句：The predispersion of the pigment in a small amount of solvent improved the quality of the final paint. 预分散颜料在少量溶剂中提高了最终油漆的质量。

The predispersion of the powder ensured even distribution in the final product. 粉末的预分散确保了最终产品中的均匀分布。|近义词：premix, pre-blend |反义词：post-dispersion
