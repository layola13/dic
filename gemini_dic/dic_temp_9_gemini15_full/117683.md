The word "meites" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical information cannot be provided.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name, place, or brand.
3. **It's a word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.
4. **It's a newly coined word or slang:**  Neologisms and slang terms are constantly emerging.

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you can.  With more information, I can attempt to help.
