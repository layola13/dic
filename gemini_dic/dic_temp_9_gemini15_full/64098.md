英文解析:Eponyms are words or names that are derived from the names of persons, places, or things.  These names often become associated with a particular invention, discovery, event, or concept.  The person's name may be directly used to form the new word (e.g., "sandwich"), or it may be slightly modified (e.g., "pasteurization").  Eponyms are common in various fields, including science, technology, and history.
