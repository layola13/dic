interresistance:/ˌɪntərɪˈzɪstəns/| n. |互阻，交互阻抗|The mutual impedance between two or more components in an electrical circuit.  It refers to the opposition to the flow of current that arises from the interaction between different parts of a system. This is particularly relevant in complex circuits or systems with multiple conductors or pathways.| Example: The interresistance between the parallel branches significantly affected the overall circuit performance.  互阻现象影响了电路的整体性能。|近义词: mutual impedance, cross-impedance |反义词:  conductance (in the context of the opposite effect) |名词
