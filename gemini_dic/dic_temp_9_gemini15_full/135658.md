PHRASE->
This word, being a complex noun, doesn't readily form common phrases in the same way simpler words do.  It's more likely to be used in descriptive phrases. Examples:


a list of nonpreferablenesses
the identified nonpreferablenesses
significant nonpreferablenesses
numerous nonpreferablenesses
the major nonpreferablenesses


Word Origin:

The word is formed by combining:

* **non-**: a prefix meaning "not"
* **preferable**: an adjective meaning "more desirable"
* **-ness**: a suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives


Therefore, "nonpreferablenesses" literally means "the state or quality of being not preferable," or more simply, the undesirable aspects of something.
