词源:
The word "phenotype" is a blend of the Greek words "phainein" (to show, to appear) and "typos" (type, mark).  It was coined in the early 20th century by the Danish botanist Wilhelm Johannsen to distinguish between an organism's observable characteristics (phenotype) and its genetic makeup (genotype).
