词源:

The word "prestandardize" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and the verb "standardize" (meaning "to make something conform to a standard").  Therefore, it literally means "to standardize beforehand."

用法说明:

Prestandardize is a relatively uncommon verb, but it's useful when emphasizing the proactive nature of the standardization process.  It highlights that the standards were established *before* the actual application or implementation.  This is in contrast to standardizing something after it has already been used or implemented, which might be more reactive and less efficient.  It is often used in contexts involving manufacturing, data collection, testing procedures, and other processes where consistency and quality control are crucial.
