词源：

* **mild:**  From Old English *mild, meaning "gentle, soft, mild."  It's related to the German *mild and the Latin *mīlis (honey).

* **mannered:** From Old French *manere ("manner, way, custom"),  ultimately from Latin *manēre ("to remain, stay").  The "-ed" suffix here forms an adjective meaning "having the specified manner."

因此，“mild-mannered”字面意思是“具有温和举止的”。
