renewalism: /rɪˈnuːəlɪzəm/ | n. | 更新主义；复兴主义 |  The belief in or advocacy of renewal or revival, especially in a political or social context.  It often refers to movements that aim to revitalize traditional values or institutions while adapting them to modern circumstances.  The term is relatively uncommon and may be used in specific academic or political discussions.  |例句：The rise of renewalism in the party suggests a shift towards more traditional policies.  更新主义在该党的兴起表明政策转向更传统的方向。

The term "renewalism" is a relatively recent coinage, combining "renewal" with the suffix "-ism" to denote a belief system or ideology.  Its roots lie in the broader concept of renewal, which has been present in various historical and philosophical contexts.  The "-ism" suffix indicates a doctrine, system, or practice.  Therefore, the word's etymology traces back to the Latin word "renovare" (to renew) and the Greek suffix "-ismos" (forming nouns denoting doctrines or practices).
