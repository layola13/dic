词源:
The word "gleanings" comes from the verb "glean," which originates from the Old English word *glēan, meaning "to gather (what is left)" or "to pick up."  This reflects the original agricultural sense of collecting leftover grains after a harvest.  Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass the collection of any kind of scattered or leftover items or information.
