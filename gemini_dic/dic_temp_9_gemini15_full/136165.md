词源:  The word "nonregulations" is a compound word.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of," derived from Old French *non and ultimately from Latin *non. "Regulations" comes from the verb "regulate," which traces back to Old French *reguler and ultimately to Latin *regulare, meaning "to make straight, to rule, to govern." Therefore, "nonregulations" literally means "not governed by rules."
