词源:

The word "considerable" comes from the verb "consider," meaning "to think about carefully,"  combined with the suffix "-able," meaning "capable of being" or "worthy of."  Therefore, "considerable" originally meant "worthy of being considered." Over time, it evolved to also mean "large" or "substantial."


用法说明:

1. 表示数量或程度很大:  This usage emphasizes the size or extent of something.  For example: "a considerable sum of money" or "considerable effort."

2. 表示值得考虑: This usage highlights the importance or merit of something. For example: "a considerable risk" or "a considerable improvement."


The word "considerablest" is an older, less common variant of "considerable."  While grammatically correct, it sounds somewhat archaic or overly formal in modern English.  "Considerable" is the preferred and more widely used form.
