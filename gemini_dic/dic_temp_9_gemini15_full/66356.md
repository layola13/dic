词源:

The word "excusable" comes from the Old French word "escusable," which itself is derived from the Latin word "excusare."  "Excusare" is composed of the prefix "ex-" (out, from) and the verb "causare" (to plead, to allege).  Therefore, the root meaning points to "pleading one's way out" of a situation or removing a cause for blame.
