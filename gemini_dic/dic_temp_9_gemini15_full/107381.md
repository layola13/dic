词源:
The word "lamenters" is derived from the verb "lament," which comes from the Old French word "lamenter," meaning "to weep, to wail, to lament."  The Old French word ultimately traces back to the Latin word "lamentare," which has the same meaning.  The "-ers" suffix is a noun suffix indicating a person who performs the action of the verb.
