词源:
The word "preconsign" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and the verb "consign," which originally meant "to entrust" or "to give into someone's care."  Therefore, "preconsign" literally means "to entrust or send before."  The root of "consign" is the Latin word *consignare*,  from *con-* (together) + *signare* (to mark, sign).  The sense of shipping goods developed later.
