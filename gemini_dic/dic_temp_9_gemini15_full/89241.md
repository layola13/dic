词源:
The word "homily" comes from the Late Latin word *homilia*, which in turn derives from the Greek word *homilia* (ὁμιλία), meaning "conversation," "discourse," or "assembly."  The Greek word is related to *homilein* (ὁμιλεῖν), meaning "to converse," "to associate," or "to speak."  The shift in meaning from general conversation to specifically religious instruction occurred over time.
