radiopacity: /ˌreɪdiəʊˈpæsɪti/ | adj. | 射线不透性，放射线阻射性 | The degree to which a substance or tissue absorbs X-rays or other forms of radiation.  A high radiopacity indicates that the substance absorbs a lot of radiation, appearing bright or white on an X-ray image.  A low radiopacity indicates the opposite, appearing dark or black. | Example:  The metal implant showed high radiopacity on the X-ray.  X光片上金属植入物显示出高射线不透性。 |近义词: radiopaque |反义词: radiolucency


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The bone shows high radiopacity. = 骨骼显示高射线不透性。
This material exhibits low radiopacity. = 这种材料表现出低射线不透性。


一般过去时:
The tumor showed increased radiopacity compared to surrounding tissue. = 与周围组织相比，肿瘤显示出增加的射线不透性。
The dentist noted the filling's high radiopacity. = 牙医注意到填充物的高射线不透性。


现在完成时:
Researchers have observed variations in radiopacity across different samples. = 研究人员已经观察到不同样本之间射线不透性的变化。
The patient has shown improved radiopacity in the affected area since treatment. = 自治疗以来，患者患处的射线不透性有所改善。


过去完成时:
The radiologist had already identified the high radiopacity before the surgery. = 放射科医生在手术前已经发现了高射线不透性。
They had not anticipated the unexpectedly low radiopacity of the new material. = 他们没有预料到这种新材料的射线不透性出乎意料地低。


将来时:
The scan will likely reveal the radiopacity of the foreign object. = 扫描很可能会显示异物的射线不透性。
We will determine the radiopacity of the sample after further testing. = 我们将在进一步测试后确定样品的射线不透性。


虚拟语气:
If the object had higher radiopacity, it would be easier to detect on the X-ray. = 如果该物体具有更高的射线不透性，则更容易在X光片上检测到它。
I wish the image showed clearer radiopacity distinctions. = 我希望图像显示更清晰的射线不透性差异。


被动语态:
The radiopacity of the lesion was clearly demonstrated. = 病灶的射线不透性得到了清晰的证明。
Radiopacity is often used to differentiate between different tissues. = 射线不透性常用于区分不同的组织。


疑问句:
What is the radiopacity of this substance? = 这种物质的射线不透性是多少？
Does the radiopacity indicate a pathological condition? = 射线不透性是否表明病理状况？


否定句:
The tissue did not exhibit significant radiopacity. = 该组织没有表现出明显的射线不透性。
The image showed a lack of radiopacity in that area. = 图像显示该区域缺乏射线不透性。


PHRASE->
high radiopacity = 高射线不透性
low radiopacity = 低射线不透性
degree of radiopacity = 射线不透性程度
radiopacity measurements = 射线不透性测量
variations in radiopacity = 射线不透性的变化

词源:
radio- (from Latin radius, "ray") + opacity (from Latin opacus, "dark," "obscure")
