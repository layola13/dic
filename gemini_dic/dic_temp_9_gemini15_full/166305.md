The word "prereferences" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis as requested.  To help, I need clarification on the intended word.  Is it a possible misspelling of another word?  If it's a newly coined term, please provide context where you encountered it.
