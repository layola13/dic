词源:

From Latin *pronubialis, from pronuba ("bridesmaid," literally "one who leads the bride"), from pro ("before," "in front of") + nubere ("to veil," "to marry").  The word reflects the traditional role of bridesmaids in assisting the bride before and during the wedding ceremony.


用法说明:

The adjective "pronubial" is less common than "nuptial" or "bridal," but it is used to describe things related to marriage, particularly the period immediately before a wedding.  It emphasizes the pre-wedding aspects.  While "nuptial" often refers to the wedding ceremony itself, "pronubial" can encompass the preparations and events leading up to it.
