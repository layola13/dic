词源:
The word "mare" comes from the Old English word "mere," which also meant "female horse."  This word, in turn, has Proto-Germanic and Proto-Indo-European roots related to other words denoting female animals. The association with "nightmare" developed later, likely due to the perceived power and sometimes unpredictable nature of horses.  The figurative use referring to a bad-tempered woman is a more recent development, stemming from the original sense of a powerful and sometimes untamed animal.
