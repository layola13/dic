词源:
The word "outcharging" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent" or "exceeding") and the verb "charging" (meaning "to demand payment").  Therefore, it literally means "charging to a greater extent than is fair or reasonable."  There's no specific historical etymology beyond this straightforward combination of existing words.
