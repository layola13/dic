词源:

The term "navel-gazing" is a relatively recent addition to the English language.  It's a figurative expression, using the image of someone literally staring at their navel to represent a state of intense self-focus. The image is evocative and easily understood. While there's no single documented origin point, its usage has become widespread in the latter half of the 20th century.  The metaphorical application of the act of navel-gazing to describe self-absorption developed organically within the language.
