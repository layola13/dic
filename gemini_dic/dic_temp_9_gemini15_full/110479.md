词源:
The word "lily" comes from the Old English word "lilie," which in turn is derived from the Latin word "lilium."  The Latin word has roots in Greek, ultimately tracing back to a Proto-Indo-European root related to words meaning "white" and perhaps also indicating its association with whiteness and purity.
