The phrase's origin is uncertain, but it likely emerged in the mid-20th century as slang.  The imagery suggests a carefree abandonment of inhibitions, much like letting loose clothing hang freely. The "it" refers to one's inhibitions or reservations.  There is no single traceable source, but its usage reflects a growing social acceptance of less reserved behavior in certain contexts.
