词源:
The word "range" ultimately derives from the Old French word "ranger," meaning "to arrange," "to set in order," or "to place in a row."  This Old French word has roots in the Vulgar Latin word "rangare," which is of uncertain origin, possibly related to a Germanic root.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the spatial sense of extending over an area or a series of values.
