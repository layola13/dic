词源:  The word "imbecility" comes from the Old French word "imbecillité," which in turn derives from the Late Latin word "imbecillitas."  This Latin word is a combination of the prefix "im-" (meaning "not" or "without") and "becillus" (meaning "weak," "feeble," or "staff").  Therefore, the original meaning referred to physical weakness, but it evolved to encompass mental weakness and lack of intelligence.
