Word Origin:

The word is a combination of:

* **pseudo-**:  A prefix meaning "false," "sham," or "pretended."  It comes from the Greek word  ψευδής (pseudēs) meaning "false."
* **inspiring**: An adjective meaning "filling someone with the urge or ability to do or feel something, especially to do something creative."  It comes from the verb "inspire," which ultimately derives from the Latin word *inspirare* meaning "to breathe into."

Therefore, "pseudoinspiring" literally means "falsely inspiring" or "pretending to be inspiring."
