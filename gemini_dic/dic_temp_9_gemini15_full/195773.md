词源:  The word "semiwarfare" is a compound word formed from the prefix "semi-" (meaning "half," "partially," or "incomplete") and the noun "warfare" (meaning "military conflict").  Therefore, it literally means "half-war" or "partial warfare." The term emerged as a way to describe conflicts that do not meet the traditional definition of war but still involve significant violence and hostility.
