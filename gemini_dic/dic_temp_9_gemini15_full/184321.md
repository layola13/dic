词源：

The word "respectable" derives from the verb "respect," which comes from the Old French word "respecter," meaning "to look at again, to consider."  This, in turn, is from the Latin "respectus," a past participle of "respicere," meaning "to look back at, to regard, to consider." The suffix "-able" adds the meaning of "capable of being" or "worthy of."  Thus, "respectable" means "worthy of respect" or "capable of being respected."
