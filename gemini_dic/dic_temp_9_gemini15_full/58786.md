词源:  The word "dun" originates from the Old English word "dun," meaning "dark," "dull," or "gloomy." This likely refers to the somber mood of the debtor facing a demanding creditor.  The connection to demanding payment likely developed through the sense of "to make dull or gloomy" by persistent demands.  Over time, it evolved to specifically mean "to demand payment."
