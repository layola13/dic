randomizations:/ˌrændəmɪˈzeɪʃənz/ | n. |随机化；随机分配 | The process of assigning participants or treatments to groups in a completely random manner, eliminating bias.  This is crucial in scientific experiments to ensure valid results. | Example: The randomizations in the clinical trial ensured that the treatment and control groups were comparable.  临床试验中的随机化确保了治疗组和对照组具有可比性。|近义词：random assignments, random selections |反义词：systematization, structuring

USAGE->
