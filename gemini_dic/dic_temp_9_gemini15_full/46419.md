The word "dage" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a word from a specific dialect or jargon, or a neologism (newly coined word).  To provide an analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (book, website, conversation, etc.)
* **What was the surrounding text or conversation?** This would help determine the intended meaning.

If you can provide this context, I might be able to offer a possible interpretation and analysis.
