词源:
The word "fritter" comes from the Old French word *friteure*, meaning "frying," referring to the act of cutting something into small pieces for frying.  This evolved into the sense of breaking something down into small, insignificant parts, eventually leading to the meaning of wasting time or resources on unimportant things.
