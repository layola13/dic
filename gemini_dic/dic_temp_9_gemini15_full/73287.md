词源:  The word "forebodingnesses" is derived from the word "foreboding," which itself combines "fore-" (meaning "before" or "in anticipation of") and "boding" (meaning "omen" or "presentiment").  "Boding" comes from the Old English word "bodian," meaning "to announce," "to proclaim," or "to foretell."  Thus, "foreboding" literally means "a foretelling of something bad," and "forebodingnesses" is the plural form, indicating multiple instances of such feelings.
