The word "deral" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you intended another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* **It's a neologism or technical term:** It might be a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field.  If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it might be possible to determine its meaning.
* **It's a proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (like a place name or a person's name) that isn't widely known.


Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis. Please clarify the word or provide context.
