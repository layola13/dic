The word "mytiloid" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or recognized scientific terminology.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and usage description are impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a term from a very specialized field not widely known.  To provide the requested analysis, more context is needed.  For example, where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the source would help determine its meaning and possible origin.
