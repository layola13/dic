pelton:/ˈpɛltən/| n. |佩尔顿式水轮机|A Pelton wheel is a type of impulse turbine.  It's used in hydroelectric power plants to convert the kinetic energy of moving water into mechanical energy, which then generates electricity.  The water is channeled through nozzles to create high-velocity jets that strike buckets on the wheel's circumference.  The force of the water jets causes the wheel to rotate, driving a generator.|The Pelton wheel is highly efficient in high-head, low-flow applications.  This hydroelectric power plant uses a Pelton turbine to generate electricity.|近义词：impulse turbine, water turbine|反义词：无
