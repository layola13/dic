non-hyperbolic:/ˌnɒnˌhaɪpəˈbɒlɪk/| adj. |非双曲线的；非双曲型的|Not exhibiting the properties of a hyperbola.  This term is primarily used in mathematics, particularly in geometry and dynamical systems.  It describes systems or shapes that do not possess the characteristics of a hyperbola, such as its asymptotic behavior or specific geometric properties. |Example:  The non-hyperbolic fixed point indicates a stable equilibrium.  非双曲不动点表示稳定的平衡状态。The system exhibits non-hyperbolic behavior near the bifurcation point. 该系统在分叉点附近表现出非双曲行为。|近义词：non-chaotic (in some contexts), stable (in some contexts)|反义词：hyperbolic


USAGE->
This word is primarily used within a mathematical or scientific context, and doesn't have common usage in everyday conversation or general writing. Therefore, illustrating grammatical tenses with examples is less relevant than showing its usage in specific mathematical settings.

Example 1 (Geometry):
The mapping demonstrates non-hyperbolic dynamics in the region near the origin. 该映射在原点附近的区域展示了非双曲动力学。


Example 2 (Dynamical Systems):
The analysis reveals that the non-hyperbolic attractor is characterized by its slow convergence to the fixed point. 分析表明，非双曲吸引子的特点是其缓慢收敛到不动点。


Example 3 (Differential Equations):
The differential equation yields a non-hyperbolic solution under these specific boundary conditions. 在这些特定的边界条件下，微分方程产生非双曲解。


Example 4 (Complex Analysis):
The non-hyperbolic Riemann surface is distinguished by its lack of certain conformal properties. 非双曲黎曼曲面以其缺乏某些共形性质而著称。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "non-hyperbolic".  The term is highly specialized.
