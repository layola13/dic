The word "leerest" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  To get a helpful response, please provide a correctly spelled word.
