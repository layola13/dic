词源:

The word is formed by combining "mis-" (meaning "badly," "wrongly," or "ill") with "chanceful," which itself is derived from "chance" (meaning "opportunity," "luck," or "likelihood").  "Chanceful" originally meant "lucky" or "fortunate" but has largely fallen out of use except in this negative, prefixed form. Therefore, the word's meaning is the opposite of its etymological components individually.
