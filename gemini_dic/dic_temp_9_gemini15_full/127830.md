nematoid:/ˈnɛməˌtɔɪd/| n. |线虫；线形动物|A nematode is a type of worm belonging to the phylum Nematoda.  They are unsegmented, cylindrical worms found in a wide variety of habitats, including soil, water, and the bodies of plants and animals. Many are microscopic, but some can be quite large. Some nematodes are parasitic, causing disease in plants and animals, while others are free-living and play important roles in ecosystems. | Example: The farmer treated the soil to eliminate the harmful nematodes that were damaging his crops.  = 农民处理土壤以消除损害其作物的有害线虫。


The roots of the word "nematode" come from the Greek words "nēma" (νήμα), meaning "thread," and "eidos" (εἶδος), meaning "form" or "appearance."  Thus, the word literally means "thread-shaped."
