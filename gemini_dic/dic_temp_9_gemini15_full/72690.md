For example, a lens with a short focal length will have a wider field of view and lower magnification, while a lens with a long focal length will have a narrower field of view and higher magnification.|Example: The photographer adjusted the focal distance on his camera to achieve the desired depth of field.  摄影师调整了相机上的焦距以获得所需的景深。 The telescope's long focal distance allows for high magnification of distant objects. 这台望远镜的长焦距允许对远距离物体进行高倍率放大。|近义词：focal length|反义词：无|
