词源:
The word "skewer" ultimately derives from the Old French word "esquivier," which referred to a small, pointed stick.  This, in turn, has uncertain origins, possibly connected to a Germanic root. The "-ing" suffix indicates the present participle or gerund form, representing the action of skewering.
