re-feels:/ˌriːˈfiːlz/| n.|再感受，重新感受|The word "re-feels" is not a standard English word.  It's a neologism, a newly coined word, likely formed by combining "re-" (meaning again) and "feels" (the plural of "feel," referring to emotions or sensations).  It implies experiencing emotions or sensations again, perhaps after a period of time or in a new context.  The meaning depends heavily on context.|例句： I had a re-feels of nostalgia when I saw my old photos. (当我看到我的旧照片时，我又一次感到了怀旧之情。)  He experienced a re-feels of his childhood trauma after watching the movie. (看完电影后，他又一次经历了童年创伤的感受。) |近义词：recollections, renewed feelings, second feelings|反义词：forgetting, numbness|名词
