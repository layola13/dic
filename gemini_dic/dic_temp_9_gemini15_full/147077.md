词源:

The word "overliberality" is a compound word.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "too much," "excessive," or "beyond."  "Liberality" comes from the Latin word "liberalitas," meaning "generosity," "freedom," or "openness."  Therefore, "overliberality" literally means "excessive generosity" or "excessive freedom."
