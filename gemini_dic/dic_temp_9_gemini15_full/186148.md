词源:
The word "rhapsody" comes from the Greek word "rhapsōidia," which literally means "stitching together of songs."  In ancient Greece, a "rhapsode" was a performer who recited epic poems, often stitching together different parts to create a longer, more complex performance.  The word evolved to describe musical compositions of a similar character: long, complex, and emotionally charged.
