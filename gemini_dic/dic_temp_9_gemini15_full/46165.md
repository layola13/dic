词源:The word "cynicism" ultimately derives from the Greek word "kynikos," meaning "dog-like." This refers to the Cynic philosophers of ancient Greece, who lived a simple, austere life and openly criticized societal conventions, often adopting a harsh and provocative manner.  Their philosophy emphasized virtue and self-sufficiency, rejecting worldly possessions and social norms.  Over time, the term evolved to describe the more negative aspects of their philosophy, focusing on distrust and negativity.
