词源:

The word is a compound of "full" and "frontal."  "Full" signifies completeness or totality. "Frontal" refers to the front or face,  but in this context, it implies a direct, unobscured view of the entire front of the body.  The combined meaning emerged in the context of artistic and photographic depictions of nudity and later extended to more metaphorical uses.
