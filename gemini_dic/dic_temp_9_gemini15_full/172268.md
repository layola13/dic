词源:

The word "pussyfoot" is a blend of "pussy" (referring to a cat's paws) and "foot".  The image is of a cat walking softly and stealthily.  The word initially appeared in the early 20th century, gaining popularity during the Prohibition era in the United States, describing those who were timidly approaching the issue of alcohol.
