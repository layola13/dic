词源:
The word "ragamuffin" is a compound word.  "Rag" refers to old, torn pieces of cloth, and "muffin" originally referred to a small, round, often untidy person. The combination suggests a person dressed in tattered rags, hence the meaning.  The word's origins are ultimately uncertain, though it likely emerged in the 17th century.
