self-variances:/ˌsɛlfˈveriənsɪz/| n.|自身方差，自方差|The differences in variance within a single variable or data set.  Self-variances are often used in statistical analysis to understand the variability within a single group or population.  They are distinct from variances that compare differences between groups.|例句：Analyzing the self-variances of the data revealed significant internal inconsistencies. 分析数据的自身方差揭示了内部存在显著的不一致性。

The calculation of self-variances helps to understand the inherent variability within a dataset before making comparisons between different groups. 计算自方差有助于理解数据集中的固有变异性，然后才能比较不同组。|近义词：intra-variances, within-group variances|反义词：inter-variances, between-group variances|名词

The high self-variances in the control group suggest considerable individual differences in response to the treatment. 控制组的高自身方差表明对治疗的反应存在相当大的个体差异。

Example 2 (Inferential Statistics):
The analysis of self-variances allowed us to control for individual heterogeneity when comparing treatment effects across different patient subgroups. 自身方差分析使我们能够在比较不同患者亚组的治疗效果时控制个体异质性。
