词源:
The origin of "skedaddle" is uncertain, but it is believed to be of American origin, possibly emerging in the 19th century.  Several theories exist, but none are definitively proven. One suggestion links it to a Scottish dialect word.  Another suggests it is onomatopoeic, mimicking the sound of quick, hurried footsteps.
