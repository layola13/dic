词源:

The word "discerner" comes from the verb "discern," which itself originates from the Old French word "descerner," meaning "to separate," "to distinguish," or "to decide."  This in turn derives from the Latin word "discernere,"  a compound of "dis-" (apart) and "cernere" (to separate, to sift).  Therefore, the root meaning points to the ability to separate or distinguish between things.
