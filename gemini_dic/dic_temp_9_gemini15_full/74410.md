词源:

The word "franchisabilities" is derived from the noun "franchise" and the suffix "-abilities."

* **Franchise:**  Originates from Old French *franchise*, meaning "freedom, liberty, exemption from."  It evolved to encompass the grant of a right or privilege, especially the right to operate a business under an established name and system.

* **-abilities:** A suffix indicating the quality or state of being able to do something, or the capacity for something.  It's formed from "-able" (capable of) plus the noun-forming suffix "-ity."


Therefore, "franchisabilities" signifies the qualities or characteristics that make something suitable or capable of being franchised.
