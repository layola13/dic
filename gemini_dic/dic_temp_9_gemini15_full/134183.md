词源：

* **non-**:  prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of".
* **inclination**:  noun meaning "a liking or preference for something; a tendency to behave in a particular way".  It comes from the verb "incline," meaning "to lean or bend; to be disposed or predisposed."  The root is the Latin "inclinare," from "in-" (in, towards) + "clinare" (to bend).


用法说明：

"Noninclination" is a relatively uncommon word, often used in more formal writing.  It emphasizes the absence of any desire or predisposition to act in a certain way.  It is stronger than simply "disinclination" in implying a complete lack of interest or willingness.  It does not usually have grammatical variations beyond its basic noun form.  It can be modified by adjectives such as "strong," "marked," or "evident."
