词源:
The word "enact" comes from the Old French "enacter," which is a combination of the prefix "en-" (meaning "in" or "into") and "acter" (meaning "to act" or "to do").  The ultimate origin is the Latin word "agere," meaning "to do" or "to drive."  Thus, the original meaning is to "put into action."
