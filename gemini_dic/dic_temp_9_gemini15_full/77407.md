词源:
The verb "give in" is a phrasal verb, meaning the meaning is not simply the sum of its parts.  "Give" means to yield or surrender, and "in" indicates the direction of the yielding.  Its roots trace back to the Old English verb *giefan, meaning "to give,"  and the preposition "in" which has Germanic origins. The combination evolved over time into its current idiomatic meaning.
