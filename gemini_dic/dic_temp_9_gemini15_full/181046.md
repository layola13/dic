词源:
The word "reinclose" is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the verb "enclose" (meaning "to surround or confine").  "Enclose" itself has origins in the Old French word "enclore," ultimately deriving from the Latin "claudere" (to shut). Therefore, "reinclose" literally means "to shut again."
