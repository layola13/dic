non-homologous:/ˌnɒnhoʊˈmɒləɡəs/ | adj. | 非同源的 | Not homologous; not having the same evolutionary origin but performing similar functions.  Describes structures, genes, or characteristics that have evolved independently to perform similar functions, rather than being inherited from a common ancestor. | Example: The wings of birds and bats are non-homologous structures, as they evolved independently despite their similar function in flight.  鸟类和蝙蝠的翅膀是非同源结构，因为它们是独立进化而来的，尽管它们具有相似的飞行功能。 | 近义词: analogous, convergent | 反义词: homologous
