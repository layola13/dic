词源:  The word comes from the Old French word *descheveler*, meaning "to dishevel," which itself is composed of the prefix *des-* (meaning "to undo" or "to remove") and *chevel* (meaning "hair").  Therefore, the original meaning was specifically related to untangling or disarranging hair. Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass a more general sense of untidiness and disarray.
