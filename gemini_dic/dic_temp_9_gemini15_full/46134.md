cyme:/saɪm/| n.|聚伞花序|A cyme is a type of inflorescence (flower cluster) in which the central flower opens first, and the lateral flowers open later.  The main axis terminates in a flower, and subsequent flowers develop from lateral buds.  This results in a determinate inflorescence, meaning its growth is limited and it doesn't continue to grow indefinitely.  Different types of cymes exist, depending on the branching pattern.|例句：The elderflower has a characteristic flat-topped cyme. 接骨木花有一个独特的平顶聚伞花序。|The inflorescence of the plant was a delicate cyme. 这株植物的花序是一个精致的聚伞花序。|近义词：inflorescence, raceme (though racemes are indeterminate)|反义词：无|名词
