The word "presocialisms" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or common usage.  It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word, or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need clarification:

* **Is it a misspelling?**  Could you be thinking of a similar word, perhaps related to socialism or pre-socialist ideas?  Providing the intended context would be beneficial.
* **Is it a newly coined term?** If so, what is the intended meaning or context in which it is used?

Once you provide more information, I can offer a more accurate analysis.  If it's a genuine misspelling, I can suggest the correct word and provide the analysis as requested.
