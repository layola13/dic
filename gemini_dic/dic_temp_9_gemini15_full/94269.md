词源：

The word "impersonalities" is derived from the word "impersonal," which in turn is formed from the prefix "im-" (meaning "not") and the word "personal," which comes from the Old French word "personel" and ultimately from the Latin word "persona" (meaning "mask," "character," or "person").  Therefore, "impersonal" means "not having a distinct personality," and "impersonalities" refers to the instances or qualities of being impersonal.
