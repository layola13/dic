词源:
From Late Latin confiscāre, from Latin confiscāre "to seize," from fiscus "treasury."  The word ultimately derives from the Latin word "fiscus," meaning "treasury" or "money chest."  The prefix "con-" indicates thoroughness or completeness.  Therefore, "confiscate" originally meant to seize something entirely for the treasury.
