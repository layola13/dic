Etymology:

The word "fraternism" derives from the Latin word "frater," meaning "brother."  Through Old French "fraternité" (brotherhood), it entered English, initially referring to the bonds of brotherhood within religious orders.  The modern usage has expanded to encompass broader notions of camaraderie and mutual support within any group sharing a common bond.
