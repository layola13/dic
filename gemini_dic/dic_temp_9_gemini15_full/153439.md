pennatula:/pɛˈnætʃʊlə/| n. |海笔|A pennatula is a type of colonial marine invertebrate belonging to the order Pennatulacea.  They are often referred to as sea pens because of their resemblance to quill pens.  They have a central stalk that anchors them in the sediment, and numerous polyps branch out from it, creating a feathery appearance.  They are typically found in deeper waters.  They are bioluminescent, meaning they can produce light. | Example:  The divers observed a beautiful pennatula swaying gently in the current.  潜水员们观察到一支美丽的羽枝海笔在水流中轻轻摇曳。|近义词：sea pen|反义词：无
