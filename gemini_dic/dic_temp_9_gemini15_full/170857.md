pseudohalide:/ˈsuːdoʊˌheɪlaɪd/| n. |拟卤化物|A pseudohalide is an anion that resembles a halide ion (like chloride, Cl⁻) in its chemical behavior, but is not a halide.  These anions often contain carbon, nitrogen, or other non-halogen atoms. They can form compounds similar to halides, but with some important differences in properties. For example, they can participate in reactions similar to halide ions, such as forming salts with metals.  However, they may exhibit different reactivity and bonding characteristics.|Example: Cyanide (CN⁻) is a common pseudohalide.|近义词：anion (in the context of similar chemical behavior)|反义词：halide
