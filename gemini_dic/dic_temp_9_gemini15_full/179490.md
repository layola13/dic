The word "reeden" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps a word related to "reed" (a tall, slender plant)?  Providing context would help determine the intended word.
* **A dialect word or proper noun:** It might be a regionalism or a name.
* **A newly coined word:**  It's possible it's a very recent creation not yet widely used.


Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following your requested format. To help me assist you, please provide more information, such as:

* **The sentence or context where you encountered this word.** This will help clarify its meaning and intended usage.
* **Any other information about the source of the word.**  Did you see it in a book, online, or hear it spoken?

With more information, I can try to determine the intended word and provide the analysis you requested.
