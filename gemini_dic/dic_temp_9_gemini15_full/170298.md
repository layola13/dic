provenient:/prəˈviːniənt/| adj.| 起源的；产生的；发生的 |  Derived from or originating in a particular place or source.  This word is rarely used in modern English and is largely considered archaic or obsolete.  | Example: The provenient waters of the river flowed from the mountain springs.  这条河的源头之水来自山泉。|近义词：originating, deriving, emanating, stemming | 反义词：resulting (in a different sense, as provenient implies origin, while resulting implies consequence)
