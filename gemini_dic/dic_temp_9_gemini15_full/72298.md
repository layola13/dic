词源:
The word "flounder" ultimately derives from the Old English word *flunder, referring to the flatfish (a type of fish). The verb sense, implying a clumsy struggle, likely arose from the fish's seemingly awkward movements.  The connection is onomatopoeic in nature, suggesting the sound of struggling.
