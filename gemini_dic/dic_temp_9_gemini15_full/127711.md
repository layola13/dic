词源:
 neglect (v.) + -ful (adj. suffix) + -ness (n. suffix) + -es (plural suffix)

The word ultimately derives from the Old French *negliger  ("to neglect"), from *negligere (Latin), from *nec ("not") + *legere ("to gather, choose, read").  The suffix "-ful" indicates "full of," and "-ness" creates a noun meaning "the state or quality of being."  The "-es" is a standard plural marker for nouns.
