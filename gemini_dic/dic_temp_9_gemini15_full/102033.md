词源:
The word "isolated" comes from the past participle of the verb "isolate," which itself derives from the French word "isoler," meaning "to insulate" or "to separate."  The ultimate origin lies in the Latin word "insula," meaning "island."  The concept of being on an island is the root of the meaning of separation and detachment.
