ionised:/ˈaɪənaɪzd/| adj.| 电离的；离子化的 |  Describes an atom or molecule that has lost or gained electrons, resulting in a net electrical charge.  It's a state where an atom or molecule is no longer electrically neutral. | Example: The air in the upper atmosphere is highly ionised by solar radiation.  高层大气中的空气被太阳辐射高度电离。  The gas was ionised by the electric field. 气体被电场电离。|近义词：ionized (American spelling)|反义词：neutralized

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The sun ionizes the upper atmosphere. = 太阳电离高层大气。
This chemical reaction ionizes the solution. = 这个化学反应使溶液电离。

一般过去时:
The scientist ionised the gas sample. = 科学家电离了气体样本。
The lightning bolt ionised the air. = 闪电电离了空气。

现在完成时:
The radiation has ionised many of the atoms. = 辐射已经电离了许多原子。
The experiment has successfully ionised the molecules. = 实验成功地电离了分子。

过去完成时:
The air had already been ionised before the experiment began. = 实验开始前空气已经被电离了。
The sample had been ionised completely by the time the analysis started. = 分析开始时样品已经被完全电离了。

将来时:
The laser will ionise the target material. = 激光将电离目标材料。
The new device will ionise the water efficiently. = 新设备将有效地电离水。

虚拟语气:
If we increased the voltage, we would ionise the gas more effectively. = 如果我们增加电压，我们将更有效地电离气体。
I wish the experiment had ionised the sample more completely. = 我希望实验能更彻底地电离样品。

被动语态:
The gas was ionised by the electric discharge. = 气体被放电电离。
The atoms are being ionised by the high-energy particles. = 原子正在被高能粒子电离。

疑问句:
Is the gas fully ionised? = 气体完全电离了吗？
Has the solution been ionised properly? = 溶液被正确电离了吗？

否定句:
The gas was not fully ionised. = 气体没有完全电离。
The sample did not ionise under the given conditions. = 样品在给定条件下没有电离。


PHRASE->
highly ionised = 高度电离的
partially ionised = 部分电离的
ionised gas = 电离气体
ionised layer = 电离层
ionised radiation = 电离辐射
