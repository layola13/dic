The word "jizyah" does not exist in standard English.  It appears you are referring to the Arabic word **جِزْيَة (jizya)**.  Therefore, I will provide an analysis of the Arabic word *jizya*.  I cannot provide grammatical usages in the same way as for an English word, as *jizya* is a noun.


/dʒɪzˈjɑː/ | n. |人头税；非穆斯林赋税|A tax historically levied by Muslim rulers on non-Muslim subjects (dhimmis) in exchange for protection and the right to practice their religion.  The exact nature and application of the jizya varied considerably across different times and places, often subject to debate and differing interpretations within Islamic jurisprudence.|  The jizya was a significant source of revenue for many Muslim empires.  However, its implementation and the treatment of dhimmis were often highly contested issues.   |  tribute, tax, levy |  — (No direct antonym, but the *absence* of jizya could be considered the antonym in the context of historical governance of dhimmis)| noun

**Etymology:**

The word *jizya* (جِزْيَة) comes from the Arabic root ج ز ي (j-z-y), which relates to recompense, reward, or retribution.  The term originally signified a "payment" or "compensation," and its application to a tax on non-Muslims evolved over time.

**Historical Context:**

The jizya was a significant aspect of Islamic governance in many historical periods.  It was levied on non-Muslim adult males, generally excluding women, children, the elderly, the sick, and religious figures.  The amount varied based on factors such as wealth and social status.  The jizya was often justified within Islamic legal frameworks as a form of protection offered to non-Muslim communities living under Muslim rule in exchange for their safety and the right to practice their religion.


**Modern Usage:**

The term *jizya* is rarely used in everyday conversation. It is primarily discussed in historical, religious, and academic contexts related to Islamic history and law.  The historical application of the jizya remains a subject of complex and often contentious debate, with diverse interpretations of its historical significance and implications.  Modern usage often involves critical analysis of the historical context and its implications for interfaith relations and concepts of religious tolerance.

**Note:** Because this is an Arabic word, providing English grammatical usage examples (past tense, future tense, etc.) is irrelevant.  The word functions as a noun in Arabic and its usage in English discussion is similarly limited to its definition and related historical discussions.
