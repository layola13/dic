The word "mayfish" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word, a misspelling, or a proper noun specific to a certain context (like a place name or a brand name).  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide an answer in the requested format would be to fabricate information.
