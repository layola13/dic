词源:
The word "regret" comes from the Old French word "regreter," meaning "to lament, grieve, bewail."  This, in turn, ultimately derives from the Latin word "regerere," meaning "to bring back, restore." The sense of "regret" developed from the idea of wishing to bring back something lost or undo something done.
