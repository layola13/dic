词源:
The word "semi-double" is a compound word.  "Semi-" is a prefix derived from Latin "semi-", meaning "half" or "partly". "Double" refers to the number of rows of petals in a flower.  Therefore, "semi-double" literally means "half-double", indicating a flower with more than one row of petals, but not a full double bloom.
