The word "outquestions" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need to consider possible interpretations:

**Possibility 1: Misspelling**

If it's a misspelling, it could be one of the following:

* **Out-questions:** This could be a hyphenated compound word implying "to surpass in questioning," "to exceed in questioning," or "to ask more questions than."  This would be an informal usage.

* **Outquestions:** (Without a hyphen) This could be a verb implying a similar meaning to the hyphenated version.

In either case, we'd need context to understand its intended meaning.


**Possibility 2: Neologism**

If it's a neologism, its meaning would be entirely dependent on the context in which it was used.  Without that context, we cannot analyze it.
