词源:  The word "impassioned" comes from the Old French word "impassioner," meaning "to suffer passion," which in turn derives from the Latin word "passionem," the noun form of "pati," meaning "to suffer."  The prefix "im-" intensifies the meaning.  Therefore, "impassioned" literally means "filled with strong feeling."
