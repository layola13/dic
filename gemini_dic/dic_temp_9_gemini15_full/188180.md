The word "roux" is not "rouxes".  "Roux" is a singular noun, and "rouxes" is its plural form.  I will provide the analysis for "roux".


roux: /ruː/ | n. | 鲁 (浓稠酱汁)| A roux is a cooked mixture of fat and flour used as a thickening agent in sauces.  It forms the base of many sauces, soups, and stews. The color and flavor of the roux depend on how long it is cooked.  A light roux is cooked only briefly, while a dark roux is cooked for a much longer time, resulting in a darker color and nuttier flavor.|

例句：

She made a delicious béchamel sauce, starting with a blonde roux. = 她做了一道美味的白酱，是从浅色鲁开始的。

The chef carefully cooked the roux until it reached the desired dark brown color. = 厨师小心翼翼地烹制鲁，直到达到所需的深棕色。
