词源：The word "presupposed" comes from the prefix "pre-" (before) + "suppose" (to assume or believe).  The verb "suppose" ultimately traces back to Old French "supposer" and Latin "supponere," meaning "to place under."  Therefore, "presupposed" literally means "assumed beforehand" or "placed under beforehand."
