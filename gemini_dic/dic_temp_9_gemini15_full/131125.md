近义词:  (Depends entirely on context.  Possible options if referring to color might include):  dark gray, charcoal, brownish-black. If referring to race, this would be inappropriate and inaccurate, as it would be more appropriate to use terms like "non-Black" or other relevant descriptors.


反义词: (Also depends entirely on context.  If referring to color): black, inky black.  If referring to race, there is no direct antonym, as race is not a binary concept.
