The word "pesas" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a word from another language, possibly Spanish.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full etymological analysis and usage in English grammar tenses as requested in the format.  To help you, I need more context.  Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the language of origin will allow for a proper analysis.
