词源:

The word "ethereally" derives from the word "ether,"  which originally referred to a hypothetical substance believed to fill the upper regions of space.  This classical concept of ether, connected to lightness and the heavens,  gave rise to the modern meaning of "ethereally" implying something light, delicate, and seemingly unreal.
