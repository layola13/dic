词源：

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation, not a complete identity.

* **confidently**: From "confident," which derives from the Old French *confident*, meaning "trusting," itself from the Latin *confidere*, meaning "to trust." The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective "confident" into an adverb.
