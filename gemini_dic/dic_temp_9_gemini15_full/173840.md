/ˈkwɑːzaɪˈprɒɡrɛsɪv/ | adj. |准进行的；似进行的 | Quasi-progressive refers to verb forms that resemble progressive aspects (using "be" + present participle) but don't fully express continuous action.  They often convey a sense of temporary or habitual action, or a state viewed as ongoing.  It's a grammatical term used in linguistics, particularly in discussions of aspect and tense.  The term highlights the borderline nature of certain verb constructions. | The frequent use of the simple present tense in English, even when referring to ongoing actions, can be considered quasi-progressive in certain contexts. For example, "I work in London" can sometimes imply continuous residence,  though not as explicitly as "I am working in London".|近义词：inchoative, imperfective (in some contexts) | 反义词：perfective (in some contexts)
