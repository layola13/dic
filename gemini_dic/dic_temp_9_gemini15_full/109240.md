词源:
The word "leisurely" derives from the Old French word "leisire," meaning "leisure"  (freedom from work or duties; free time), which itself has roots in the Latin word "licere," meaning "to be permitted" or "to be allowed".  The "-ly" suffix transforms the noun "leisure" into an adverb, signifying "in a leisurely manner," and then into an adjective describing something characterized by leisure.
