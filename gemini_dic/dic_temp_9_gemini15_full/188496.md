词源:  The word "ruffian" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "ruffe," meaning "rough" or "wrinkled." This term likely referred to someone with a rough, unkempt appearance, which later became associated with violent and disorderly behavior.  The word evolved through various forms in different languages before settling into its current meaning.
