词源:

The word "resolution" comes from the Old French word "resolucion," which in turn derives from the Latin word "resolutionem," the accusative singular form of "resolutio."  "Resolutio" is formed from the verb "resolvere," meaning "to loosen, untie, dissolve, melt, or explain," which is itself a compound of "re-" (again) and "solvere" (to loosen).  The various meanings of "resolution" reflect the different senses of the original Latin verb.
