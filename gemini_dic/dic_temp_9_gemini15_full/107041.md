lactone:/ˈlæktoʊn/| n.|内酯|A lactone is a cyclic ester.  In other words, it's a compound formed by the intramolecular reaction between a hydroxyl group (-OH) and a carboxyl group (-COOH) of a hydroxycarboxylic acid. This forms a ring structure containing the carbonyl group (C=O) within the ring.  Lactones are common in nature and have various applications in different fields. | Example:  Many fruits and vegetables contain lactones that contribute to their aroma and flavor.  γ-Butyrolactone is a common solvent. | 近义词: cyclic ester | 反义词: (no direct antonym, but the opposite concept would be an open-chain ester)
