词源:
The word "endangerer" is derived from the verb "endanger," which combines the prefix "en-" (meaning "to cause to be") with the noun "danger."  The suffix "-er" is added to form the noun, indicating an agent or doer of the action.  Therefore, an "endangerer" is someone or something that causes danger.
