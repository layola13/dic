词源:

The word "commoditized" comes from the noun "commodity," which originates from the Old French "commodité," meaning "convenience, suitability."  The suffix "-ized" indicates the process of making something into a commodity.  The evolution reflects the shift in meaning from simply being convenient to being treated as a readily exchangeable good.
