hyetograph:/ˈhaɪɪtəɡræf/| n. |雨量图，降雨图 |A hyetograph is a graphical representation of the distribution of rainfall intensity over time during a storm or rainfall event.  It shows the rainfall intensity (e.g., in millimeters per hour or inches per hour) on the vertical axis and time on the horizontal axis. Hyetographs are essential tools in hydrology and water resource management for designing hydraulic structures (like culverts and bridges), assessing flood risks, and managing water supplies. |Example: The hyetograph revealed a peak rainfall intensity of 50 mm/hr during the intense thunderstorm.  = 雨量图显示在强烈雷暴期间，降雨强度峰值为每小时50毫米。


The hyetograph for the recent storm showed a rapid increase in rainfall intensity followed by a gradual decrease. = 最近那场暴风雨的雨量图显示，降雨强度先迅速增加，然后逐渐减少。|近义词：rainfall diagram, rainfall intensity graph|反义词：无

PHRASE->

There are no common set phrases specifically using "hyetograph." The usage is primarily within technical contexts.  However, related phrases could include:

Develop a hyetograph:  制作雨量图
Analyze a hyetograph: 分析雨量图
Construct a hyetograph: 建立雨量图
Interpret a hyetograph: 解读雨量图
Use a hyetograph in modeling: 在模型中使用雨量图


Word Origin:

The word "hyetograph" is a combination of "hieto-" (from the Greek word "hyetor," meaning "rain") and "-graph" (from the Greek word "graphein," meaning "to write" or "to draw").  Therefore, it literally means "a rain-drawing" or "a representation of rain."
