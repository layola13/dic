词源：

* **quasi-**:  from Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."  It indicates something that resembles or approximates something else but is not entirely or truly that thing.

* **sagaciously**: from  "sagacious," which comes from Latin *sagāx,* meaning "quick-witted," "perceptive," or "wise."


用法说明:

由于quasi-sagaciously是一个副词，它主要用于修饰动词，描述动作的方式。它不适用于名词或形容词。  它强调的是一种表面上的智慧或精明，而非真正的智慧或精明，往往带有讽刺或挖苦的意味。
