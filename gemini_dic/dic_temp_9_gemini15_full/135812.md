词源:
The word "nonprominences" is a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "prominences" (referring to bright, eruptive features on the sun).  Therefore, it literally means "not prominences."  The word "prominence" itself derives from the Latin word "prominere," meaning "to project," "stand out," or "be prominent."
