USAGE->
This word is quite rare and doesn't have common usage across different tenses or grammatical structures.  The usage will be determined by the context in which "graphicalness" (singular) is used,  and "graphicalnesses" (plural) is used to refer to multiple distinct graphic characteristics.  Because of this rarity, providing examples across all tenses is impractical and would be artificial.  Examples would need to be constructed around specific contexts.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "graphicalnesses".  The word itself is uncommon.
