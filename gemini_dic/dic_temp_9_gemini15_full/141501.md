opisthopulmonate:/ɒpɪsθəˈpʌlmənət/| adj.|后肺类的|Referring to a subclass of gastropods (snails and slugs) characterized by having a lung located in the posterior (rear) part of their body.  This contrasts with prosobranchs, which have their lung in the anterior (front) part.|Example: Many land snails are opisthopulmonate gastropods.|近义词:pulmonate (less specific)|反义词:prosobranch


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The land snail is an opisthopulmonate. = 这只陆地蜗牛是后肺类的。
This species exhibits opisthopulmonate characteristics. = 这个物种表现出后肺类的特征。


一般过去时:
Scientists classified the snail as opisthopulmonate. = 科学家将这只蜗牛归类为后肺类。
The researchers studied the opisthopulmonate respiratory system. = 研究人员研究了后肺类的呼吸系统。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several new opisthopulmonate species. = 研究人员已经鉴定出几种新的后肺类物种。
We have observed the opisthopulmonate's unique adaptations. = 我们观察到了后肺类独特的适应性。


过去完成时:
Before the classification, the snail had been wrongly identified as a prosobranch. = 在分类之前，这只蜗牛被错误地识别为前鳃类。
They had already studied the anatomy of opisthopulmonate gastropods. = 他们已经研究过后肺类腹足动物的解剖结构。


将来时:
Scientists will further investigate opisthopulmonate evolution. = 科学家将进一步调查后肺类的进化。
We will analyze the genetic makeup of opisthopulmonate snails. = 我们将分析后肺类蜗牛的基因构成。


虚拟语气:
If it were an opisthopulmonate, it would have a posterior lung. = 如果它是后肺类，它就会有后肺。
I wish I knew more about the diversity of opisthopulmonate species. = 我希望我能更多地了解后肺类物种的多样性。


被动语态:
The snail was classified as an opisthopulmonate. = 这只蜗牛被归类为后肺类。
The respiratory system of the opisthopulmonate is being studied. = 后肺类的呼吸系统正在被研究。


疑问句:
Is this snail an opisthopulmonate? = 这只蜗牛是后肺类吗？
What are the defining characteristics of opisthopulmonates? = 后肺类的决定性特征是什么？


否定句:
This snail is not an opisthopulmonate. = 这只蜗牛不是后肺类。
The study did not include any opisthopulmonate species. = 这项研究不包括任何后肺类物种。


PHRASE->
opisthopulmonate respiration = 后肺类呼吸
opisthopulmonate evolution = 后肺类进化
opisthopulmonate anatomy = 后肺类解剖学
opisthopulmonate phylogeny = 后肺类系统发育
