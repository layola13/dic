词源:  From the Latin word "dissimulare," meaning "to dissemble" or "to feign."  It's a combination of the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "away") and "simulare" (meaning "to imitate" or "to pretend").  Therefore, dissimulation literally means "not imitating" or "not pretending," ironically, as it refers to the act of *pretending* not to be something.
