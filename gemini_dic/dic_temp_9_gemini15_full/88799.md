The word "hoen" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* **It's a slang term or regional dialect word:**  If it's informal or specific to a certain area, it would not be included in standard dictionaries.  More context is needed.
* **It's a newly coined word or neologism:**  These words haven't yet gained widespread usage.
* **It's a proper noun:**  If it's a name or place name, the capitalization might be incorrect.

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling to get a helpful response.
