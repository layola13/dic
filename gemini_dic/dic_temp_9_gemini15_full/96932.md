词源:

The word "inextended" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "extended," which comes from the verb "extend," meaning "to stretch out" or "to prolong."  The root of "extend" is the Latin word "extendere," which is composed of "ex-" (out) and "tendere" (to stretch).


用法说明:

"Inextended" is primarily used to describe something that lacks extension or prolongation in time, space, or scope.  It emphasizes the shortness or brevity of something.  It's less common than "unextended" but carries the same meaning.  It functions as an adjective modifying a noun.
