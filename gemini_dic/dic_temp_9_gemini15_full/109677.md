leucoplast:/ˈluːkəplæst/| n. |白色体；无色体|Colorless plastids found in plant cells, lacking pigments such as chlorophyll.  They function in the storage of starch, lipids, or proteins.|Example: Potatoes store starch in their leucoplast.|近义词：amyloplast (if storing starch), elaioplast (if storing lipids), proteinoplast (if storing proteins)|反义词：chromoplast (colored plastid)
