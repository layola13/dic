词源:
From Middle English *menstruacioun, from Old French menstruacion, from Late Latin menstruatio, from Latin menstruus ("monthly"), from mensis ("month").  The root ultimately connects to the Indo-European root *me- ("to measure").  The connection lies in the regular monthly occurrence of menstruation.
