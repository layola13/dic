词源:

The term "face-saving" is a compound word combining "face," referring to reputation or public image, and "saving," meaning to rescue or preserve.  It emerged in the 20th century, reflecting growing interest in social psychology and the importance of social interaction.  The concept is deeply rooted in East Asian cultures, particularly emphasizing the preservation of honor and dignity.  However, its usage has become widespread in English, reflecting a universal concern for maintaining a positive self-image.
