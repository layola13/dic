近义词：susceptible, prone, inclined, liable

反义词：resistant, immune, impervious


词性：形容词


词源：

* **pre-:**  prefix meaning "before" or "in advance of"
* **dis-:** prefix indicating negation or reversal (though in this case, it contributes more to the sense of "inclination towards")
* **position:** from Latin *positus*, past participle of *ponere* "to place," implying a prior state or condition.
* **-al:** suffix forming adjectives.

Therefore, "predispositional" literally means "previously positioned" or "previously inclined," indicating a prior state or tendency.  The "dis" doesn't negate "position" but rather contributes to the idea of a pre-existing inclination or susceptibility.
