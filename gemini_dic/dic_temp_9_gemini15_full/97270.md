词源:
The word "influence" comes from the Old French word "influence," which itself originates from the Latin word "influentia," meaning "an inflow," "flowing in," or "influence."  The Latin word is related to the verb "influere," meaning "to flow in."  The original astronomical meaning referred to the supposed effect of celestial bodies on human affairs.  Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass any kind of power or effect on someone or something.
