词源:  The word "noncurdling" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "curdling," which derives from the Middle English word "curdlen," meaning "to coagulate or thicken."  The ultimate root is likely Proto-Germanic *kwort- meaning "to twist or turn," referring to the twisting or thickening of milk.
