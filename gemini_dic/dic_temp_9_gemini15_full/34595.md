词源:
The word "cleated" derives from the noun "cleat," meaning a spike, stud, or projecting piece providing grip.  The word "cleat" itself has origins in Middle Dutch *kleet, meaning "a small piece of wood," possibly related to the Old English word "clēat," with a similar meaning.  The "-ed" suffix indicates the past participle or adjectival form, describing something that has cleats or is equipped with them.
