mach's:/mæks/| n. |马赫数|The Mach number is a dimensionless quantity representing the ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound in the surrounding medium.  It's used in aerodynamics and fluid dynamics to characterize the flow regime around an object.|例句：The plane was traveling at Mach 2. = 飞机以2马赫的速度飞行。|例句：At Mach 1, the sound barrier is broken. = 在1马赫时，声障被打破。|近义词：speed ratio (in specific context)|反义词：None specifically.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The Mach number is calculated using a specific formula. = 马赫数是使用特定公式计算的。
What is the Mach number of this aircraft? = 这架飞机的马赫数是多少？


一般过去时:
The Concorde routinely flew at supersonic speeds (Mach 2+). = 超音速协和式飞机经常以超音速（2马赫以上）飞行。
What Mach number did the rocket reach during ascent? = 火箭在上升过程中达到了多少马赫数？


现在完成时:
Scientists have developed sophisticated methods for calculating Mach numbers. = 科学家们已经开发出计算马赫数的复杂方法。
The experimental aircraft has achieved a Mach number exceeding 5. = 实验飞机已经达到了超过5马赫的速度。


过去完成时:
Before the flight, engineers had calculated the expected Mach number. = 在飞行之前，工程师们已经计算出预期的马赫数。
They had never before reached such a high Mach number. = 他们以前从未达到过如此高的马赫数。


将来时:
Future spacecraft will operate at much higher Mach numbers. = 未来的宇宙飞船将在更高的马赫数下运行。
What Mach number will the new jet reach during its test flight? = 新型喷气式飞机在试飞期间将达到多少马赫数？


虚拟语气:
If the Mach number were higher, the shockwave would be stronger. = 如果马赫数更高，冲击波就会更强。
I wish the Mach number data were more accurate. = 我希望马赫数数据更准确。


被动语态:
The Mach number is determined by dividing the object's speed by the speed of sound. = 马赫数是通过将物体的速度除以声速来确定的。
The maximum Mach number was exceeded during the test. = 在测试过程中超过了最大马赫数。


疑问句:
What is the Mach number at this altitude? = 在这个高度的马赫数是多少？
How is the Mach number measured? = 马赫数是如何测量的？


否定句:
The missile did not reach Mach 3 during the launch. = 导弹发射时没有达到3马赫。
The Mach number was not significantly affected by the atmospheric conditions. = 马赫数不受大气条件的显著影响。
