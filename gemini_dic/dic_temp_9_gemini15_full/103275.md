英文解析:The name Jezebel comes from the Old Testament, where it refers to the Phoenician princess who married King Ahab of Israel.  She is depicted as a wicked and idolatrous queen who promoted the worship of Baal and persecuted the prophets of Yahweh.  This biblical portrayal has made "Jezebel" a byword for a wicked, seductive, and cruel woman.  The term is almost always used negatively.
