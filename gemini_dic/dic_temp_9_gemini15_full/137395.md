nontensile:/ˈnɒnˈtɛnsaɪl/ | adj. | 非张力的；非拉伸的 | Not capable of being stretched or strained; not tensile.  This term is primarily used in materials science and engineering to describe materials that do not exhibit significant tensile strength or elasticity.  | Example: The nontensile material was unsuitable for use in the bridge's suspension cables.  非张力材料不适合用于桥梁的悬索电缆。 | 近义词：inextensible, unstretchable | 反义词：tensile, elastic


USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective and doesn't have verb conjugations like "to be".  The grammatical usage focuses on its descriptive function within a sentence.  Examples illustrate its use in various sentence structures.

肯定句:
The rope is nontensile and will not stretch under load. = 这根绳子是非张力的，在负重下不会伸长。
This nontensile fabric is ideal for upholstery. = 这种非张力的织物非常适合用于室内装潢。


否定句:
The material is not nontensile; it stretches easily. =  这种材料不是非张力的；它很容易拉伸。
That's not a nontensile material, it's quite stretchy. = 那不是非张力的材料，它相当有弹性。


疑问句:
Is the material nontensile or elastic? = 这种材料是非张力的还是弹性的？
Is this a nontensile fiber? = 这是非张力的纤维吗？


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "nontensile."  Its usage is limited to technical contexts.  The following phrases might incorporate "nontensile" in a sentence, but they're not common collocations:

nontensile properties = 非张力特性
nontensile strength =  非张力强度 (Note: this is somewhat contradictory, as strength is usually associated with tensile properties. It may describe resistance to other types of stress.)
nontensile material = 非张力材料
lack of nontensile characteristics = 缺乏非张力特性
assessing nontensile behavior = 评估非张力行为
