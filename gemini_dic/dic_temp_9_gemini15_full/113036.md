luminescence:/ˌluːmɪˈnɛsəns/ | n. |发光，冷光 | The emission of light by a substance not as a result of heat; a process that produces light without significant heat.  Luminescence is a broad term encompassing various phenomena like fluorescence, phosphorescence, and chemiluminescence. | Example: Fireflies exhibit a remarkable form of bioluminescence.  萤火虫展现出一种非凡的生物发光现象。The gemstone showed a beautiful luminescence under ultraviolet light.  宝石在紫外线下展现出美丽的冷光。|近义词：phosphorescence, fluorescence, bioluminescence | 反义词：darkness, obscurity |

词源:
The word "luminescence" comes from the Latin word "lumen," meaning "light," and the suffix "-escence," indicating a process or state of becoming.  Therefore, luminescence literally means "the process of becoming light."
