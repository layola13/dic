词源:
The word "invigilance" comes from the Latin word "vigilans," meaning "watchful" or "alert."  The prefix "in-" in this context doesn't mean "not," but rather indicates the act of, or being engaged in, the action.  Therefore, "invigilance" literally means "the act of watching over" or "supervision."
