词源:
The word derives from the Latin "incontinens," meaning "incontinent," which itself combines the prefix "in-" (not) and "continens" (containing, holding back).  Therefore, "incontinently" originally meant "without restraint" or "without control," referring to a lack of self-control, especially in relation to bodily functions or emotions.  Its modern usage retains this sense of immediacy and lack of restraint, though it's less frequently used in the context of bodily functions.
