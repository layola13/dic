词源:
The word "intercipient" derives from the verb "intercept," which itself comes from the Latin prefix "inter-" (between, among) and the verb "capere" (to take, seize).  The suffix "-ient" forms an adjective meaning "having the nature of" or "tending to." Therefore, "intercipient" literally means "having the nature of intercepting" or "tending to intercept."
