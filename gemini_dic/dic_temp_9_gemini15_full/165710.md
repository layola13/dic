The word "premusically" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, I need to know the intended meaning or context where you encountered this word.  Was it perhaps a typo of a similar-sounding word, or a creative word invented for a specific purpose?  Providing more context will allow me to offer a more accurate response.
