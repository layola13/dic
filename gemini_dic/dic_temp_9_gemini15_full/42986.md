词源:

The word "covetously" derives from the verb "covet," which comes from the Old French word "coveiter," meaning "to desire greatly" or "to long for."  This in turn has roots in the Latin word "cupere," meaning "to desire."  The "-ously" suffix is an adverbial ending, transforming the adjective "covetous" into the adverb "covetously."
