chesstree:/ˈtʃɛsttriː/| n. |棋盘游戏树|A hypothetical tree-like structure used in game playing, especially chess, to represent all possible game states and moves.  It's a concept used in artificial intelligence and game theory to analyze and strategize. The root of the tree represents the initial game state, and each branch represents a possible move, leading to a new game state. This continues recursively until terminal nodes (end of the game) are reached.|Example:  The chess engine analyzed the chestree to find the optimal move.|近义词：game tree, decision tree|反义词：无|名词


USAGE->

将来时:
The AI will generate a chestree to determine its next move. = 人工智能将生成一个棋盘游戏树来决定下一步行动。
