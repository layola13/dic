The word "seur" is not a word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please double-check your spelling.
* **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name, place, or brand.
* **It's from a specific dialect or jargon:** It might be used within a particular community or field.
* **It's a newly coined word:**  New words are constantly being created.

To provide the analysis you requested, I need the correct spelling of the word you intend.
