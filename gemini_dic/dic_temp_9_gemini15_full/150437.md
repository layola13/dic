The word "panta" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  If you could provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to suggest a possible correct spelling.

2. **A word from another language:**  "Panta" might be a word from another language.  If you can tell me the language's origin, I can try to find a translation and explanation.

3. **A proper noun or neologism:** It could be a proper noun (like a place name or person's name) or a newly coined word (neologism) not yet included in standard dictionaries.  Again, context is crucial.

Please provide more information so I can help you.
