The word "choots" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible. It's likely a misspelling, a slang term, a dialect word, or a proper noun.  To provide an analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (e.g., a book, a conversation, online)
* **What was the surrounding text or conversation?** This will help determine the intended meaning.


If you can provide this context, I can try to offer a possible interpretation and analysis.
