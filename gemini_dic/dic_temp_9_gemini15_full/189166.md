词源:
The word "sacking" originates from the verb "to sack," meaning to plunder or loot.  This meaning evolved from the act of emptying or stripping something, like emptying a sack.  The application to dismissing employees likely developed from the idea of abruptly removing someone from their position, similar to the sudden emptying of a sack.
