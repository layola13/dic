词源:

The word "mongrelizing" is derived from "mongrel," meaning a mixed-breed animal, particularly a dog. "Mongrel" itself has a complex etymology, possibly originating from the Old French "mon gre," meaning "of my pleasure" or "my choice," suggesting an animal of mixed parentage bred without careful selection.  The "-izing" suffix indicates the process of making something into a mongrel.
