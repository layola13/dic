The word is a combination of:

* **hyper-**: A prefix meaning "over," "above," or "excessive."  Derived from Greek ὑπέρ (hupér).
* **romantic**: Relating to romance or idealized love.  Derived from the French word *romantique*, ultimately from the Italian *romanesco*.

Therefore, "hyperromantically" signifies an excessive or exaggerated degree of romanticism.
