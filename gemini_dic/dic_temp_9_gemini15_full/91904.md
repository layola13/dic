USAGE->

This word is relatively rare and doesn't readily lend itself to typical grammatical tense conjugations like the example you provided for "what".  The grammatical usage would depend entirely on the sentence structure in which it's used.  Examples:


Present Simple:  The professor's lectures were often characterized by hyperlogicalities.  教授的讲座经常以超逻辑性为特征。

Past Simple: Her defense relied on a series of hyperlogicalities that ultimately undermined her credibility.  她的辩护依赖于一系列超逻辑的论证，最终损害了她的信誉。


PHRASE->

There are no common idiomatic phrases using "hyperlogicalities".  The word is too specialized for common phrasal usage.
