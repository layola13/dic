词源:

The term "derring-do" is a compound word of somewhat obscure origin.  "Derring" is an archaic word meaning "daring" or "bold," and "do" is simply the verb meaning "to act" or "to perform." It's believed to have arisen in the late 16th or early 17th century, likely influenced by the romantic and adventurous spirit of the Elizabethan era. Its use solidified in literature, most notably through the works of Edmund Spenser's "The Faerie Queene," where it contributed to its enduring image as evocative of heroic, adventurous deeds.
