词源:
The word "reasonable" comes from the Old French word "resnable," which itself derives from the Old French "raison," meaning "reason."  The suffix "-able" indicates something capable of being or worthy of being.  Therefore, "reasonable" literally means "capable of being reasoned," or "consistent with reason."
