词源:
The word "depriver" comes from the verb "deprive," which originates from the Old French word "depriver," meaning "to take away from," "to rob," or "to divest."  This in turn derives from the Latin verb "privare," meaning "to deprive," "to take away," or "to rob," which itself is related to the Latin word "privus," meaning "deprived," "private," or "peculiar."
