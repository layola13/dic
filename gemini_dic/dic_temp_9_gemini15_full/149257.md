Etymology:

The word "oystercatcher" is a compound word, combining "oyster" and "catcher."  "Oyster" comes from the Old French "oistre," ultimately derived from the Latin "ostrea."  "Catcher" is derived from the Old English word "caccian," meaning "to catch" or "to seize."  The name directly reflects the bird's primary food source and hunting method.
