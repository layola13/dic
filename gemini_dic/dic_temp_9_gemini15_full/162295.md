The word "preaccomplishing" is formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") with the verb "accomplishing" (meaning "to achieve or complete").  It's a relatively modern coinage, likely not found in older dictionaries, reflecting the need to express the idea of completing something ahead of schedule in a single word.
