词源:

The word "cornerstone" is a compound word.  "Corner" comes from Old English *cornor, meaning "angle," "a place where two lines or surfaces meet." "Stone" comes from Old English *stān,  meaning "stone."  The combination signifies a stone placed in a corner, originally in the context of building construction, often a significant or ceremonial stone.  Its metaphorical extension to represent fundamental principles came later.
