词源:

The word "overskepticalness" is a relatively new formation. It's a combination of:

* **over-**:  A prefix indicating "too much" or "excessive."
* **skeptical**: Adjective meaning inclined to doubt or question.  Derived from the Greek "skeptikos," meaning "inquiring," related to "skeptesthai," meaning "to consider" or "to look at."
* **-ness**: A suffix forming nouns of state or condition.

Therefore, "overskepticalness" literally means "the state of being excessively skeptical."
