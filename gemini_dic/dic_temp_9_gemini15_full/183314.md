词源:

The word "reproachfulness" is derived from the verb "reproach" and the suffix "-fulness."

* **reproach:**  This word comes from Old French *reprochier*, ultimately from Latin *repropinquare*, meaning "to draw near again,"  "to approach."  The semantic shift to "blame" or "rebuke" occurred over time.  The idea is that one brings something bad or wrong to someone's attention, bringing them "near" to their fault.

* **-fulness:** This suffix is a common English suffix forming nouns that mean "the state or quality of being..."  In this case, it means "the state or quality of being reproachful."
