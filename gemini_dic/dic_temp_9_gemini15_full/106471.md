词源:  The word "kowtow" originates from the Mandarin Chinese word  叩頭 (kòutóu), literally meaning "to knock the head."  This referred to the ritual prostration performed in ancient China as a sign of deep respect or submission to superiors, especially the emperor.  The word entered English in the 17th century through contact with China.
