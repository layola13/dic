/ˌoʊvərˈmɛloʊnɪsnɪsiz/ | n. |过度成熟；过度成熟的状态 |The word "overmellownesses" is not a standard English word.  It's a neologism, likely formed by combining "over-" (meaning excessively) with "mellowness" (a state of being mellow, ripe, or mature).  Therefore, it would describe an excessive or extreme state of mellowness, perhaps implying something past its prime or overly soft and ripe.  There is no established dictionary definition, usage, or synonyms/antonyms.  The meaning would depend entirely on context. | Example: The overmellownesses of the fruit made them too soft to transport.  (The fruit was excessively ripe and therefore too soft for shipping.) |  N/A | N/A | n.
