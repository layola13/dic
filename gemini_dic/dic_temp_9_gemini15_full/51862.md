dextronic: /dɛkˈstrɒnɪk/ | adj. | 电子控制的，电子驱动的 |  Combining "dexterous" (skillful in physical movements) and "electronic," this term describes systems or devices controlled or powered by electronics, often implying a high degree of precision and control. It suggests sophisticated electronic mechanisms enabling nimble and precise actions. | Example: The dextronic surgical robot allowed for minimally invasive procedures with exceptional accuracy.  | 近义词：electronically controlled, automated, robotic  | 反义词：manual, mechanical (in the sense of lacking electronic control) | 形容词
