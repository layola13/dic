英文解析:The term "nonhedonistic" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "hedonistic" (relating to hedonism, the pursuit of pleasure as a primary goal in life).  Therefore, "nonhedonistic" describes something or someone that does not prioritize pleasure or happiness. It suggests a focus on other values, such as duty, virtue, self-improvement, or spiritual growth, often at the expense of immediate gratification.
