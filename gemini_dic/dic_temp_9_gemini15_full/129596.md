词源:

The word "non-compensation" is a compound word.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of," derived from Latin "non."  "Compensation" comes from the Latin "compensatio," meaning "making amends,"  itself from "compensare," "to weigh equally."  Therefore, "non-compensation" literally means "the state of not being compensated."
