词源:
The word "firing" originates from the Old English word "fyran," meaning "to set on fire" or "to kindle."  This root also gave rise to words like "fire" and "fiery."  The sense of "dismissing from employment" developed later, likely metaphorically referring to the swift and decisive nature of the action, similar to the suddenness of igniting something.
