mensurability: /ˌmɛʒərəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可测性，可度量性 | The quality or state of being measurable; the extent to which something can be measured.  It refers to the ability to assign numerical values to a variable or phenomenon.  This is crucial in various fields, including mathematics, statistics, and physics. | Example: The mensurability of the risk involved in this investment is a key factor in deciding whether to proceed.  这个投资所涉及风险的可测性是决定是否继续的关键因素。  | 近义词: measurability, quantifiability | 反义词: unmeasurability, unquantifiability | 名词

PHRASE->
high mensurability = 高可测性
low mensurability = 低可测性
degree of mensurability = 可测性程度
assess mensurability = 评估可测性
improve mensurability = 提高可测性

词源:  Derived from "measure" (Old French *mesure, from Latin mensura, from metiri "to measure") + "-ability" (suffix indicating capacity or capability).  Therefore, it literally means "the ability to be measured."
