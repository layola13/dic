immiscibilities:/ɪmɪsɪˈbɪlətiz/ | n. |不相溶性；不相容性 | The inability of two or more substances to mix or blend together to form a homogeneous mixture.  This refers to the lack of miscibility, often observed in liquids.  The degree of immiscibility can vary; some substances may show partial miscibility while others are completely immiscible. | Example: The immiscibilities of oil and water are well-known.  油和水的互不相溶是众所周知的。


The immiscibilities of these polymers prevented the formation of a uniform blend. 这些聚合物的互不相溶性阻止了均匀混合物的形成。|近义词：incompatibility, insolubility |反义词：miscibility, compatibility
