choriambus:/ˈkɔːriæmbəs/| n. |舞蹈步; 抑扬格|A choriambus is a metrical foot in classical poetry consisting of four syllables with a pattern of short-long-long-short (˘˘˘˘).  It's a combination of an iamb and a trochee.  The term is primarily used in discussions of classical prosody and metrics.|Example: The word "choriambus" itself, when stressed according to classical pronunciation, could potentially fit the pattern (depending on the language and pronunciation).  However, English pronunciation doesn't easily map to the classical metrical system.|近义词:None (it's a specific metrical foot)|反义词:None (it's not a concept that readily lends itself to antonyms)|名词
