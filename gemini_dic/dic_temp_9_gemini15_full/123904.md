词源:
The word "mordication" is derived from the Latin word "mordere," meaning "to bite."  The sense of "biting" evolved to represent a feeling of being deeply affected or wounded, leading to the modern understanding of discouragement or dejection.  The "-ation" suffix indicates the action or process.
