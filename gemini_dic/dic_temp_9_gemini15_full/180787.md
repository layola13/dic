词源:
The word "regurgitate" comes from the Latin word "regurgitare," which means "to flow back."  The prefix "re-" means "back" or "again," and "gurgitare" is related to "gurges," meaning "whirlpool" or "gulf."  The original sense referred to the physical act of bringing up swallowed food, and later extended to the metaphorical sense of repeating something unthinkingly.
