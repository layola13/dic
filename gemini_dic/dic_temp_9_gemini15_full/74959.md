friation:/fraɪˈeɪʃən/| n. |摩擦；磨损|The process of rubbing two surfaces together, causing wear or damage.  Friation is often used in a technical context to describe the mechanical wear of materials.|例句：The friation of the metal parts caused significant damage to the machine. 金属部件的摩擦对机器造成了严重的损坏。  The excessive friation led to premature engine failure. 过度的摩擦导致发动机过早损坏。|近义词：abrasion, attrition, wear, friction|反义词：smoothness, lubrication


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The engine experiences significant friation during operation. = 发动机在运行过程中会经历严重的摩擦。
Friation of the gears reduces their lifespan. = 齿轮的摩擦会缩短其使用寿命。


一般过去时:
Excessive friation damaged the bearing last week. = 上周过度的摩擦损坏了轴承。
The friation between the two surfaces caused a noticeable scratch. = 两个表面之间的摩擦造成了明显的划痕。


现在完成时:
The constant friation has worn down the brake pads. = 持续的摩擦已经磨损了刹车片。
Years of friation have significantly reduced the effectiveness of the machine. = 多年的摩擦已经大大降低了机器的效率。


过去完成时:
Before the breakdown, the machine had experienced extensive friation. = 在故障发生之前，机器已经经历了大量的摩擦。
The excessive friation had already weakened the structure before the accident. = 事故发生前，过度的摩擦已经削弱了结构。


将来时:
Continued use will cause further friation of the components. = 持续使用会造成部件进一步的磨损。
The increased load will likely result in greater friation. = 增加的负载可能会导致更大的摩擦。


虚拟语气:
If there were less friation, the engine would last longer. = 如果摩擦较小，发动机寿命会更长。
I wish the friation in this machine were less. = 我希望这台机器的摩擦更小。


被动语态:
The parts were damaged by the friation. = 部件被摩擦损坏。
The machine's performance was affected by excessive friation. = 机器性能受到过度摩擦的影响。


疑问句:
Is the friation causing the noise? = 摩擦声是摩擦引起的？
What is causing this level of friation? = 什么导致了这种程度的摩擦？


否定句:
The friation was not severe enough to cause failure. = 摩擦并不严重到导致故障。
Proper lubrication prevents excessive friation. = 适当的润滑可以防止过度摩擦。



PHRASE->
friation wear = 摩擦磨损
friation resistance = 抗摩擦性
friation coefficient = 摩擦系数
reduce friation = 减少摩擦
friation test = 摩擦试验
