priestianity:/ˌpriːstiˈænɪti/| n. |僧侣统治；僧侣制度|The hypothetical system of governance or social order where priests hold dominant power and influence.  This is not a real word found in standard dictionaries; it's likely a neologism or a made-up word combining "priest" and "Christianity". It suggests a society or system heavily influenced by priestly authority, potentially in a way that deviates from or exceeds the typical influence of religious leaders in a Christian context.  | Example:  The author described a dystopian future ruled by a strict priestianity, where religious dogma dictated every aspect of life.  |近义词: theocracy,clericalism |反义词: secularism, democracy

PHRASE->

Because "priestianity" is not an established word,  phrases using it would be similarly neologistic and depend heavily on context.  Examples are difficult to provide reliably as standard phrases don't exist.  One could potentially construct phrases like:

"the rise of priestianity," "the dangers of priestianity," "a critique of priestianity," "the fall of priestianity," "aspects of priestianity."  These are illustrative and not established phrases.
