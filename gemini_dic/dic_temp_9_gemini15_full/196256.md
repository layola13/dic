词源:
The word "sere" ultimately derives from the Old French word "sec," meaning "dry."  This Old French word, in turn, has roots in the Latin word "siccus," also meaning "dry."  The evolution of the word reflects the long-standing association between the word and the condition of dryness.

用法说明:

The adjective "sere" is primarily used to describe the appearance of vegetation or landscapes that are dry and withered, often due to a lack of moisture or the passage of time.  It can also be used more figuratively to describe something that is lifeless or lacking in vitality.  The word often carries a sense of age and decay.  It is less common than words like "dry" or "withered," but it offers a more evocative and poetic description.
