maximal:/ˈmæksɪməl/| adj.|最大的；极大的；最大限度的|  The word "maximal" describes something that is as large or great as possible within a given context or constraint.  It doesn't necessarily mean the absolute largest possible thing in all existence, but rather the largest within a specific set of limitations.  For example, a maximal subset of a set is a subset that cannot be made larger without violating the constraints defining the subset.  |例句：The company achieved maximal efficiency by streamlining its processes. 公司通过精简流程实现了最大效率。
