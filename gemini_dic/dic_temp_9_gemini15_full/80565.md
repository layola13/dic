词性：名词

词源:  The word is a compound of "goody-goody," a term of informal reproach for someone who is excessively or hypocritically virtuous, and the suffix "-ness," which forms nouns of state or quality.  "Goody-goody" itself is likely a reduplication of "goody," an archaic term for a sweet treat or a good or kind person.  The shift in meaning from simply "good" to "excessively or affectedly good" reflects a common linguistic phenomenon where terms of praise can become terms of derision when used ironically or sarcastically.
