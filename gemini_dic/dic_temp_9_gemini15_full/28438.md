carboxyl:/kɑːrˈbɒksɪl/| n. |羧基|A carboxyl group is an organic functional group consisting of a carbon atom double bonded to an oxygen atom and single bonded to a hydroxyl group (-OH).  It is represented as -COOH or -CO₂H. Carboxyl groups are acidic and readily ionize to release a proton (H+), forming a carboxylate ion (-COO⁻). This acidic nature is crucial to the properties of many organic molecules, including amino acids and fatty acids.|The carboxyl group in acetic acid gives it its acidic properties.|近义词: carboxylate (ion)|反义词:N/A

PHRASE->
carboxyl group = 羧基
carboxylic acid = 羧酸
carboxylate anion = 羧酸根阴离子
carboxyl terminal = 羧基端
carboxypeptidase = 羧肽酶

词源:
From "carbo-" (carbon) + "-oxyl" (referring to oxygen).  The "-yl" suffix indicates a group or radical.  It reflects the chemical structure: a carbon atom bonded to an oxygen atom (carbonyl) and a hydroxyl group.
