The word "chiral" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a very obscure term.  Did you perhaps mean "chiral"?


If you meant **chiral**:

/ˈkaɪrəl/ | adj. | 手性的；对映异构的 | Relating to or denoting isomers that are mirror images of one another and cannot be superimposed.  This term is primarily used in chemistry and related fields.  Chiral molecules exhibit chirality, meaning they have a "handedness" – like a left hand and a right hand, which are mirror images but not superimposable.  This property affects their interaction with polarized light and other chiral molecules.

例句：

Many biologically active molecules are chiral. = 许多具有生物活性的分子都是手性的。

The chiral center in this molecule is the carbon atom bonded to four different groups. = 这个分子中的手性中心是与四个不同基团键合的碳原子。


近义词：stereoisomeric (in a specific context)

反义词：achiral


词性: adjective


USAGE->  (Since "chiral" is primarily an adjective, tense considerations don't apply in the same way as with verbs.)

Describing a molecule:
The molecule is chiral. = 这个分子是手性的。
This compound exhibits chiral properties. = 此化合物表现出手性特性。

In a comparative sense:
This isomer is chiral, unlike its counterpart. = 与其对应物不同，这种异构体是手性的。
The two enantiomers are chiral, but mirror images of each other. = 这两种对映异构体都是手性的，但互为镜像。


PHRASE->

chiral center: 手性中心
chiral molecule: 手性分子
chiral recognition: 手性识别
chiral chromatography: 手性色谱法
chiral catalyst: 手性催化剂
