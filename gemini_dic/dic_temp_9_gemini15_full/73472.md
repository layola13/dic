词源:  The word "forepossessed" is a combination of "fore-" (meaning "before" or "prior") and "possessed" (meaning "controlled" or "influenced").  The "possessed" element  has roots in the Latin word "possidere," meaning "to sit upon" or "to occupy."  The overall meaning thus points to a prior state of being occupied or controlled by a particular feeling, idea, or belief.
