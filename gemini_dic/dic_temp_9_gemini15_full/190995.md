词源:
Scallywaggery is derived from "scallywag," a playful term for a mischievous or roguish person.  The "-ery" suffix adds the sense of action or practice, resulting in "scallywaggery" meaning the actions or behavior of a scallywag.  The ultimate origin of "scallywag" is uncertain, but it's believed to be of uncertain origin, possibly a blend of words or a playful alteration of existing terms.
