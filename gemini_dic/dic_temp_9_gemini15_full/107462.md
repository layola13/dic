词源:
The word "lampshade" is a compound word formed from "lamp" and "shade".  "Lamp" comes from the Latin word "lampa," meaning a lamp or torch. "Shade" comes from the Old English word "scadu," meaning shadow or shelter. Thus, "lampshade" literally means a cover that provides shadow or shelter for a lamp.
