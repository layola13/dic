词源：

The word is a combination of "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and "methodical" (meaning "systematic" or "orderly").  It describes something that is not systematic or planned before it is done.


用法说明：

Premethodical is primarily used as an adjective to describe actions, processes, or approaches that lack pre-planning or a systematic approach.  It often implies a degree of randomness or impulsiveness.  It is less common than its antonym, "methodical," but is useful in situations where emphasizing the lack of forethought is important.
