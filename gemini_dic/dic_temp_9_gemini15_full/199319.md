词源:
The word "simarre" is derived from the French word of the same spelling. Its ultimate origin is uncertain, but it likely comes from an earlier form, possibly related to words signifying loose or flowing garments.  The French word itself entered the English language, reflecting the historical influence of French fashion and language.
