词源:
The word "prisonment" is derived from the Old French word "prisonnement," which in turn comes from the Latin word "prensio," meaning "seizure" or "capture."  The suffix "-ment" indicates a state or condition.  Therefore, "prisonment" literally signifies the state of being seized or captured, specifically in a prison.
