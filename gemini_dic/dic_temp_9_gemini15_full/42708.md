countertransports:/ˈkaʊntərtrænspɔːrts/ | n. |逆向转运，反向转运 |The simultaneous transport of two different substances across a membrane in opposite directions.  This often involves one substance moving down its concentration gradient to provide the energy for the other substance to move against its gradient.  |例句：Sodium-potassium pumps are examples of countertransport, where sodium ions are pumped out of the cell and potassium ions are pumped in. 钠钾泵是逆向转运的例子，其中钠离子被泵出细胞，钾离子被泵入细胞。

The process of countertransport is crucial in maintaining cellular homeostasis. 逆向转运过程对维持细胞稳态至关重要。|近义词：antiport, exchange diffusion |反义词：symport, cotransport |名词

否定句:
Countertransport does not always require ATP. = 逆向转运并不总是需要ATP。
The cells did not exhibit countertransport under these conditions. = 在这些条件下，细胞没有表现出逆向转运。


PHRASE->
There are not common phrases directly using "countertransport" as it is a scientific term. However, related phrases include:

active transport 逆向转运
membrane transport 膜转运
ion transport 离子转运
secondary active transport 次级主动转运
sodium-potassium pump 钠钾泵



词源:

The word "countertransport" is a compound word formed from "counter-" (meaning "opposite" or "against") and "transport" (meaning "to carry or move").  The term reflects the process of moving substances in opposite directions across a membrane.
