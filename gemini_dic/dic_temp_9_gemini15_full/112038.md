词源:

* **long-winded:**  This adjective is a compound word. "Long" is an old English word meaning "extended in duration or space". "Winded" in this context derives from the Old English word "windan," meaning "to wind,"  suggesting a winding, circuitous, and thus lengthy path of speech.  The imagery is one of a speaker meandering and taking a long, indirect route to their point.

* **-ness:** This suffix is a common English suffix that turns adjectives into nouns, indicating a state, condition, or quality.  In this case, it transforms the adjective "long-winded" into the noun "long-windedness," indicating the state of being long-winded.
