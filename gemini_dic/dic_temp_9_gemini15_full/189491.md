The word "sakiyeh" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a transliteration of a word from another language, most probably Arabic.  Therefore, I cannot provide a complete analysis following the requested format.  To do so, I need the source language and its meaning.

If you can provide the source language and meaning of "sakiyeh", I can then attempt to provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, word class, translation, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical applications (though the latter will depend heavily on the word's function in its source language).
