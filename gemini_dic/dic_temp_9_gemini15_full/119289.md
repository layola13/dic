词源:
The word "micro-encapsulation" is a compound word. "Micro-" is a prefix meaning "small," derived from the Greek word "μικρός" (mikrós). "Encapsulation" comes from "en-" (in or into) and "capsule" (a small case or covering), ultimately deriving from the Latin word "capsula" (a small box).  Therefore, "micro-encapsulation" literally means "the process of enclosing something in small capsules".
