/ˈsuːdəʊveəriːz/ | n. | 假变异；伪变异 | Pseudovaries refers to a phenomenon where something appears to be varying or changing, but the variation is not genuine or significant.  It often implies a superficial or artificial change, lacking true underlying variation.  The term is primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly in biology and genetics, to describe situations where observed differences are not due to actual genetic or phenotypic changes but to other factors.  | Example: The observed pseudovaries in the experimental group could be attributed to measurement error rather than a true biological effect.  | 近义词:  apparent variation, seeming change, superficial difference | 反义词: true variation, genuine change, real difference |  n.

The results show a level of pseudovaries that needs further investigation. = 结果显示存在一定程度的假变异，需要进一步调查。


一般过去时 (Past Simple):  Previous research identified several instances of pseudovaries. = 先前的研究发现了几个假变异的例子。
The experiment revealed the pseudovaries were caused by environmental factors. = 实验表明，假变异是由环境因素造成的。


现在完成时 (Present Perfect): Researchers have observed pseudovaries in multiple populations. = 研究人员在多个群体中观察到假变异。
Scientists have documented numerous cases of pseudovaries in their studies. = 科学家们在他们的研究中记录了许多假变异的案例。


过去完成时 (Past Perfect): They had already accounted for the pseudovaries before publishing the results. = 他们在发表结果之前就已经考虑到了假变异。
The team realized that the discrepancies were pseudovaries that they had overlooked. = 研究小组意识到这些差异是他们忽略的假变异。


将来时 (Future Simple): Future studies will attempt to eliminate the pseudovaries. = 未来的研究将尝试消除假变异。
We expect to see less pseudovaries with improved experimental design. = 我们期望通过改进实验设计来减少假变异。


被动语态 (Passive Voice): The pseudovaries were wrongly interpreted as significant changes. = 假变异被错误地解释为重大变化。
The impact of the pseudovaries has been underestimated. = 假变异的影响被低估了。


疑问句 (Interrogative Sentence): Are these variations true variations or merely pseudovaries? = 这些变化是真正的变化还是仅仅是假变异？
Could the observed discrepancies be attributed to pseudovaries? = 观察到的差异是否可以归因于假变异？


否定句 (Negative Sentence): The data did not show any significant pseudovaries. = 数据没有显示任何显著的假变异。
