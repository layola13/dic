nonentreatingly:  /ˌnɒnɪnˈtriːtɪŋli/ | adv. | 不恳求地；不哀求地 |  This word is not found in standard English dictionaries. It appears to be a newly coined word, likely formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") and a hypothetical verb "entreat," meaning "to ask earnestly or beg."  The "-ingly" suffix indicates an adverbial function. Therefore, it describes a manner of acting without entreaty or begging. | Example: He approached the task nonentreatingly, expecting no special treatment. 他不卑不亢地处理任务，不指望得到特殊待遇。| 近义词: unimportunately, without pleading,  firmly | 反义词: entreatingly, supplicatingly, pleadingly
