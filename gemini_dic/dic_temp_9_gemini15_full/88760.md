词源:

The origin of "hocus pocus" is uncertain, but it is believed to be a corrupted form of a Latin phrase. Some theories suggest it derives from "hoc est corpus" ("this is the body"), a phrase used in the Catholic Eucharist.  Other theories propose a connection to the words "ocus pocus," possibly related to incantations or charms.  The evolution of the phrase over time has led to its current use as a general term for magic tricks or meaningless words.  Regardless of its precise origin, its use in magic shows dates back to at least the 16th century.
