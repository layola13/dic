词源:
emancipate comes from the Late Latin word *emancipare*, meaning "to set free," which is a combination of the prefix *e-* (out, from) and *mancipium* (property, possession).  The word ultimately traces back to the Proto-Indo-European root *man-*, meaning "to hand over," reflecting the legal concept of freeing someone from the ownership of another.
