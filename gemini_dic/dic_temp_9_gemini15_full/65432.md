英文解析:Euphuistic writing or speech is characterized by excessive use of elaborate figures of speech, often with a focus on alliteration, antithesis, and balanced sentence structure.  It is often seen as artificial and overly ornate, prioritizing style over clarity and directness.  The term derives from John Lyly's 16th-century prose style, which was extremely popular at the time but later fell out of favor due to its perceived artificiality.


例句：

The novel's euphuistic descriptions of nature felt contrived and unnatural to many readers. = 这部小说中对大自然的华丽描写，让许多读者感觉做作而不自然。


词源:The term "euphuistic" is derived from the word "euphuism," which itself comes from the title of John Lyly's highly influential prose work, *Euphues: The Anatomy of Wit* (1578).  "Euphues" is a Greek word meaning "well-spoken" or "of good reputation," but Lyly's use of the word established its association with a specific, highly stylized and artificial form of writing.
