homography:/həˈmɒɡrəfi/ | /hoˈmɑːɡrəfi/ | n. |单应性；透视变换|A homography is a projective transformation between two projective planes.  It is a type of transformation that maps lines to lines and preserves the cross-ratio of four collinear points.  In computer vision, homographies are used to rectify images, stitch panoramas, and estimate camera motion.|Example:  The homography matrix was calculated to align the two images. 单应性矩阵被计算出来以对齐两张图像。|近义词: projective transformation, perspective transformation |反义词: N/A
