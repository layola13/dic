USAGE->
This word is so rarely used that providing example sentences for various tenses is impractical and misleading. The grammatical structures would be identical to those of other plural nouns.  For example:


General Present Tense:
The nonobstructivenesses are apparent. = 非阻塞性是明显的。
The nonobstructivenesses of the system are remarkable. = 系统的非阻塞性是显著的。


General Past Tense:
The nonobstructivenesses were significant. = 非阻塞性是重要的。
The nonobstructivenesses of the previous system were lacking. = 前一个系统的非阻塞性不足。



PHRASE->
This word is not commonly used in phrases.  Phrases would be built around the concept of non-obstruction rather than the word itself.  For example, one might use phrases like "smooth workflow," "unimpeded progress," or "efficient operation" to convey the same meaning.
