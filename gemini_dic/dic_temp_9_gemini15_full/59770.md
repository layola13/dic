词源:

The word "economizers" derives from the verb "economize," which itself comes from the noun "economy."  "Economy" originates from the Old French "economie" and ultimately from the Greek "οἰκονομία" (oikonomia), meaning "household management," from "οἶκος" (oikos, "house") and "νέμειν" (nemein, "to manage").  Thus, the core meaning reflects efficient management of resources.
