gregarine:/ˈɡreɡərin/| n. |格雷格林虫|A type of parasitic sporozoan protozoan, typically found in the intestines of invertebrates.  Gregarines are characterized by their elongated, worm-like shape and their ability to infect a wide range of hosts. They are typically non-motile in their mature stages and reproduce through spore formation.| Example:  The researchers observed several gregarines in the gut of the grasshopper. 研究人员在蝗虫的肠道中观察到几条格雷格林虫。|近义词： sporozoan, protozoan |反义词：  (no direct antonym; perhaps "host organism")


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Gregarines infect many invertebrates. = 格雷格林虫感染许多无脊椎动物。
The scientist studies gregarine parasites. = 科学家研究格雷格林寄生虫。


一般过去时:
Researchers discovered a new species of gregarine. = 研究人员发现了一种新的格雷格林虫物种。
We observed the gregarine's life cycle. = 我们观察了格雷格林虫的生命周期。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified many types of gregarines. = 科学家已经鉴定了许多种类的格雷格林虫。
They have studied the effects of gregarine infection. = 他们已经研究了格雷格林虫感染的影响。


过去完成时:
The parasite had already infected the host before treatment began. = 在治疗开始之前，寄生虫已经感染了宿主。(虽然例子中没有gregarine，但符合过去完成时的语法结构)
The researchers had completed their study of gregarines. = 研究人员已经完成了他们对格雷格林虫的研究。


将来时:
We will examine the gregarine samples under a microscope. = 我们将在显微镜下检查格雷格林虫样本。
Scientists will continue to research gregarine parasites. = 科学家将继续研究格雷格林寄生虫。


虚拟语气:
If the infection were severe, the host would die. = 如果感染严重，宿主就会死亡。(虽然例子中没有gregarine，但符合虚拟语气的语法结构)
If the gregarine were to mutate, it could become even more harmful. = 如果格雷格林虫发生突变，它可能会变得更具危害性。


被动语态:
The host was infected by the gregarine. = 宿主被格雷格林虫感染了。
The gregarine's life cycle was carefully studied. = 格雷格林虫的生命周期被仔细研究了。


疑问句:
What type of invertebrate does this gregarine infect? = 这种格雷格林虫感染什么类型的无脊椎动物？
Where are gregarines commonly found? = 格雷格林虫通常在哪里发现？


否定句:
The sample did not contain any gregarines. = 样本中不包含任何格雷格林虫。
We did not observe any significant changes in the host. = 我们没有观察到宿主有任何显著变化。(虽然例子中没有gregarine，但符合否定句的语法结构)


PHRASE->
gregarine infection = 格雷格林虫感染
gregarine parasite = 格雷格林寄生虫
gregarine life cycle = 格雷格林虫生命周期
intestinal gregarine = 肠道格雷格林虫
species of gregarine = 格雷格林虫物种
