dodecahedra:/ˌdoʊˌdekəˈhiːdrə/| n. |十二面体|A solid geometric figure with twelve plane faces.  A dodecahedron is a polyhedron with twelve faces.  Different types exist, such as the regular dodecahedron (with twelve regular pentagons as faces) and various irregular dodecahedra. |例句：The crystal structure resembled a regular dodecahedron.  这种晶体结构类似于正十二面体。

The model was a complex dodecahedron made of intricately carved wood.  这个模型是一个由复杂雕刻的木头制成的复杂十二面体。

stellated dodecahedron = 星形十二面体

词源：
From Late Latin *dodecahedron, from Greek δωδεκάεδρον (dōdekaedron), from δώδεκα (dōdeka, "twelve") + ἕδρα (hedra, "base, seat").  The Greek word literally means "twelve-sided figure".
