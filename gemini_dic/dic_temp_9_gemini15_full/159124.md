词源:

The word "pockmark" is a compound word.  "Pock" comes from the Middle English word "pok," meaning a pustule or blister, particularly one caused by smallpox.  The suffix "-mark" simply indicates a mark or scar left behind. Thus, a pockmark is literally a mark left by a pock or pustule.  The connection to smallpox is historically significant, as smallpox was a widespread disease leaving characteristic pock marks on survivors.
