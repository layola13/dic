* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name or place name.
* **It's a word from a specific dialect or jargon:**  It might be used within a particular community or field.
* **It's a newly coined word:**  It's possible, though unlikely, that it's a very recent invention.
