pseudobranchia:/ˌsuːdəʊˈbræŋkiə/| n. |假鳃|A pseudobranch is a gill-like structure found in some fish, particularly those that have a connection to the eye.  It's not a true gill involved in respiration but rather thought to have functions related to oxygenating the eye or regulating blood flow.  In some species, its function is still debated or not fully understood. |Example: The pseudobranchia of the trout is located near the eye and is believed to help oxygenate the eye tissues.|近义词: accessory gill (in some contexts)|反义词: none.
