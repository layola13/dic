The cat is completely house-trained and uses the litter box. 这只猫已经完全接受了家居训练，会使用猫砂盆。


词源:

The term is a compound word combining "house" and "trained."  "Trained" refers to the process of teaching an animal, typically a pet, to behave in a specific way, in this case, to eliminate waste only in designated areas (outside or a litter box).


用法说明:

House-trained is primarily used to describe animals, particularly dogs and cats, that have been taught to urinate and defecate outside or in a designated area within the house. It implies a level of discipline and control over the animal's bodily functions.  The term can also be used metaphorically to describe people who are disciplined and well-behaved, but this is less common.  The adjective can be used before a noun (a house-trained dog) or predicatively (The dog is house-trained).
