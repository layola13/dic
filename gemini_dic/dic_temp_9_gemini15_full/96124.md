/ɪnˈdɛl/ | n. |插入缺失|insertion or deletion of one or more nucleotides in a DNA sequence.|Indels are common mutations in DNA that can lead to genetic diseases.|近义词：mutation, variation|反义词：None

例句：

The researchers identified several indels in the gene responsible for the disease. 研究人员在导致该疾病的基因中发现了几个插入缺失。

This indel resulted in a frameshift mutation, altering the protein's function.  这个插入缺失导致移码突变，改变了蛋白质的功能。


词源:

The word "indel" is a portmanteau (a blend of two words) of "insertion" and "deletion".  It's a relatively recent term, arising from the field of molecular biology and genetics.


USAGE->

(Indels are primarily discussed within the context of genetics and molecular biology, so tense variations are less common than with other words.  The examples below illustrate typical usage.)

一般现在时:
Indels are common sources of genetic variation. 插入缺失是基因变异的常见来源。
The study analyzes the frequency of indels in different populations. 该研究分析了不同人群中插入缺失的频率。

一般过去时:
Scientists discovered a novel indel associated with a rare disease. 科学家发现了一种与罕见疾病相关的新的插入缺失。
The researchers sequenced the genome and identified several indels. 研究人员对基因组进行了测序，并识别出多个插入缺失。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified numerous indels in the human genome. 研究人员已经鉴定了人类基因组中的许多插入缺失。
Scientists have developed sophisticated tools for detecting indels. 科学家已经开发出检测插入缺失的先进工具。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, they had not anticipated the number of indels found. 在分析之前，他们没有预料到发现的插入缺失的数量。
The study had already shown a correlation between indels and the disease. 这项研究已经显示了插入缺失与疾病之间的相关性。


将来时:
Future research will focus on understanding the functional consequences of indels. 未来的研究将集中于了解插入缺失的功能后果。
They will use advanced sequencing techniques to identify more indels. 他们将使用先进的测序技术来识别更多的插入缺失。


PHRASE->

(Phrases involving "indel" are highly specialized and context-dependent.  General phrases are not applicable.)

indel detection: 插入缺失检测
indel frequency: 插入缺失频率
indel polymorphism: 插入缺失多态性
indel mapping: 插入缺失作图
indel analysis: 插入缺失分析
