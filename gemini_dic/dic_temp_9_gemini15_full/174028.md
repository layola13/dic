词源：

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," "almost," or "nearly."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation rather than a complete identity.

* **unanimously**: From "unanimous,"  itself derived from Latin *unus* ("one") and *animus* ("mind, spirit").  Therefore, unanimous means "of one mind," implying complete agreement.


用法说明：

"Quasi-unanimously" is used to describe a situation where a large majority agrees on something, but not absolutely everyone.  There might be a small number of dissenting opinions or abstentions.  It conveys a sense of near-unanimity, highlighting that the agreement is very strong, even though not perfectly complete.  It's a more nuanced way of expressing near-unanimous support than simply saying "almost unanimously," subtly emphasizing the nearness to complete unanimity.
