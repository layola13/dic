词源:

Defender comes from the Old French "defendour,"  ultimately deriving from the Latin "defendere," meaning "to ward off," "to protect," or "to forbid." The suffix "-er" indicates the agent or doer of the action.  The possessive form "'s" is a standard English grammatical construct indicating possession or association.
