词源:  The word "heartstricken" is a compound word.  "Heart" refers to the emotional center, and "stricken" means afflicted or severely affected.  The suffix "-en" transforms the adjective "stricken" into a participial adjective, modifying "heart".  Therefore, "heartstricken" literally means "having one's heart struck or afflicted".  The word's origins trace back to the Old English word "strican," meaning "to strike".
