词源:

* **displaced:**  This comes from the verb "displace," meaning to force someone or something out of their usual place or position.  It's formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away" or "opposite") and the verb "place."

* **persons:** This is the plural of "person," referring to an individual human being.


用法说明:
