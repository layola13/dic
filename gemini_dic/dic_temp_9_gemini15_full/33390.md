The word "chupatty" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a regionalism, a slang term, or a word from a fictional language.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide the requested information, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (Book, conversation, website, etc.)
* **What was the context of its use?**  (This will help determine its meaning and possible origin.)

Without this information, I cannot provide the requested format.
