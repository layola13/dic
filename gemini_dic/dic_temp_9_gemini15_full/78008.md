词源:  The word "gentleness" originates from the Old French word "gentilesse," meaning "noble birth, gentility," which itself derives from the Latin word "gentilis," meaning "of noble birth, belonging to a clan or family."  Over time, the meaning shifted to encompass the qualities associated with nobility, such as courtesy, refinement, and kindness, ultimately leading to the modern meaning of gentleness.
