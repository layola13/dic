metamictization:/ˌmɛtəmɪksaɪˈzeɪʃən/| n. |变质作用，非晶质化|The process by which a crystalline material is transformed into an amorphous, or metamict, state due to self-irradiation by radioactive elements within the crystal lattice.  This often results in a loss of crystallinity and changes in physical properties such as density and color.|例句：The metamictization of zircon is a well-studied phenomenon in geochronology.  锆石的变质作用是地质年代学中一个被充分研究的现象。|The metamictization of monazite can affect its dating accuracy. 独居石的变质作用会影响其测年精度。|近义词：amorphization|反义词：crystallization
