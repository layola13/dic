resistor:/rɪˈzɪstər/| n. |电阻器，阻抗器 |A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.  Resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. | Example: The circuit needs a 100-ohm resistor to limit the current.  这个电路需要一个100欧姆的电阻器来限制电流。

The circuit contains several resistors in series.  这个电路包含几个串联的电阻器。|近义词：impedance, resistance (as a concept) |反义词：conductor


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The resistor limits the current flow. = 电阻器限制电流。
This resistor reduces the voltage. = 这个电阻器降低电压。


一般过去时:
The resistor failed last night. = 电阻器昨晚坏了。
The engineer replaced the faulty resistor. = 工程师更换了有故障的电阻器。


现在完成时:
We have installed a new resistor. = 我们已经安装了一个新的电阻器。
They have tested the resistor thoroughly. = 他们已经彻底测试了电阻器。


过去完成时:
The circuit malfunctioned because the resistor had burned out. = 电路出现故障是因为电阻器烧坏了。
Before the repair, the resistor had already been damaged. = 维修前，电阻器已经损坏。


将来时:
We will install a higher wattage resistor. = 我们将安装一个更高瓦数的电阻器。
The technician will check the resistor tomorrow. = 技术人员明天将检查电阻器。


虚拟语气:
If the resistor were larger, the current would be lower. = 如果电阻器更大，电流就会更小。
I wish I had chosen a different resistor. = 我真希望我选择了不同的电阻器。


被动语态:
The resistor is being tested now. = 电阻器正在测试中。
The resistor was damaged during the experiment. = 电阻器在实验中受损。


疑问句:
What type of resistor is needed? = 需要什么类型的电阻器？
Is this resistor the correct value? = 这个电阻器的值正确吗？


否定句:
The circuit doesn't have the correct resistor. = 电路没有正确的电阻器。
The resistor didn't work properly. = 电阻器工作不正常。


PHRASE->
variable resistor = 可变电阻器
power resistor = 大功率电阻器
current-limiting resistor = 限流电阻器
pull-down resistor = 下拉电阻器
series resistor = 串联电阻器

词源:
The word "resistor" comes from the verb "resist," meaning "to oppose," combined with the suffix "-or," which denotes an agent or instrument.  The word reflects the resistor's function of resisting the flow of electric current.  Its origins trace back to the Latin word "resistere," meaning "to stand against."
