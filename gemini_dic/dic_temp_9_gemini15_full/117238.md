mebibyte:/ˈmɛbɪbaɪt/| n. |兆字节（二进制兆字节）|A mebibyte (MiB) is a unit of information or computer storage equal to 2<sup>20</sup> bytes, or 1,048,576 bytes.  It's a binary prefix unit, unlike the megabyte (MB) which is based on the decimal system (10<sup>6</sup> bytes, or 1,000,000 bytes). The difference stems from the use of powers of two in computer memory addressing.  The term is designed to reduce ambiguity and confusion between the decimal and binary interpretations of "megabyte".|The hard drive has a capacity of 1 terabyte, which is equivalent to 1024 gigabytes or 1,048,576 mebibytes.|近义词: MB (megabyte, in informal contexts), GiB (gibibyte)|反义词:None.
