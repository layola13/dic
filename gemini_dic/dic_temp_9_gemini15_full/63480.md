词源:  The word "entrustment" is derived from the verb "entrust," which itself comes from the Old English  "in-trūsian," meaning "to put into trust."  The prefix "in-" indicates "into," and "trūsian" is related to the word "trust." Therefore, the word's origin reflects the core meaning of placing something or someone into the care and responsibility of another, based on trust.
