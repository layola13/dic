prototroch:/ˈproʊtətrɒk/ | n. |原环带，原口环带 | A ring of cilia around the mouth of certain larval invertebrates, such as trochophore larvae.  It is used for locomotion and feeding. | Example: The prototroch of the trochophore larva beat rhythmically, propelling it through the water.  原口幼虫的原环带有节奏地跳动，推动它在水中前进。|近义词：ciliated band, larval band|反义词：无
