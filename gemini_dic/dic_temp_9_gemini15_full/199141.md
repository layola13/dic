词源:

The word "silhouetted" derives from the name Étienne de Silhouette (1709-1767), a French finance minister known for his economical lifestyle.  During his time, a popular form of portraiture involved cutting out a person's profile from dark paper, creating a cheap and simple likeness. These portraits became known as "silhouettes," and the term has since evolved to describe any dark outline against a light background.
