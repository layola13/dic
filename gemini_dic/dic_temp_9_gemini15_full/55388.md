词源:  From Old French *destemprer (to spoil, distemper, disturb), from Latin *dis- (apart) + temperare (to mix, moderate, temper).  The original meaning referred to a disordered or unbalanced state, both physically and mentally.  The modern usage retains both aspects, particularly in reference to canine illness and human mood.
