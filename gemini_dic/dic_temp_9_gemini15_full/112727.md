The word "loyed" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible it's:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A neologism or slang:**  A newly coined word or term used within a specific community or context.  If this is the case, please provide more context where you encountered this word.
* **A proper noun:**  It might be a name or a place name, not a common word.

Please provide more information or clarify the spelling so I can assist you properly.
