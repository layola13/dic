The word "hamfatter" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established meaning, pronunciation, etymology, or usage.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word), a misspelling, or a word from a very niche context (e.g., slang, jargon, fictional work).  Therefore, a complete analysis according to the requested format is impossible.
