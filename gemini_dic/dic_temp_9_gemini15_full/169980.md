protamine:/ˈproʊtəmiːn/| n. |鱼精蛋白，精蛋白|A simple, low-molecular-weight protein found in the sperm of fish and some other animals. It is rich in arginine and has a high positive charge, which allows it to bind to DNA. Protamines are involved in packaging and condensing DNA in sperm, making it compact and stable for fertilization.|Example: Protamines are essential for the proper packaging of DNA in sperm cells.|近义词：histone (partially, as both are involved in DNA packaging)|反义词：None specifically, but proteins with opposite charges could be considered contrasting.
