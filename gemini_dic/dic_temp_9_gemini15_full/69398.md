词源:  The word "feedstock" is a compound word.  "Feed" comes from Old English *fēdan, meaning "to give food to," and "stock" comes from Old Norse *stǫkkr, meaning "a log, stump, or piece of timber."  The combination suggests materials that are "fed" into a process like logs into a mill.  Its modern meaning developed in the context of industrial manufacturing, referring to the raw materials that are input into a process.
