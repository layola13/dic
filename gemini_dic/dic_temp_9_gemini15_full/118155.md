The word "mensurableness" is derived from the verb "measure" and the suffix "-able," meaning "capable of being."  The root "mens-" comes from the Latin word "mensura," meaning "measure."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "measurable" into a noun, indicating the quality or state of being measurable.
