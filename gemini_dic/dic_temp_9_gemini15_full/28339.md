词源:

The word "caramel" ultimately derives from the Spanish word "caramelo," which in turn comes from the Latin word "calamellum," meaning "reed," or a small cane. This connection arises because sugar was originally refined using cane. The process of caramelization, creating the characteristic brown color and flavor of caramel, involves heating sugar until it melts and browns.  Over time, "caramelo" evolved into "caramel," and then "caramels" to denote the candy.
