词源:
The term "low-key" emerged in the mid-20th century, combining "low" (meaning subdued or not intense) with "key" (referring to the intensity or prominence of something).  While the exact origin is difficult to pinpoint, its usage expanded significantly in recent decades, especially in informal contexts and online communication.  The metaphorical use, to describe a person or event as understated, is a relatively modern development.
