词源:
The word "craftsmanship" is a combination of "craftsman" and the suffix "-ship."  "Craftsman" comes from the Middle English "craftesman,"  ultimately deriving from the Old English "cræft" (meaning "skill, strength, power") and "mann" (meaning "man"). The suffix "-ship" indicates "state, condition, skill, or art."  Therefore, "craftsmanship" literally means the "skill or art of a craftsman."
