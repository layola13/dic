pseudobreccia: /ˌsuːdəʊˈbreʃə/ | n. | 假角砾岩 |  A rock that resembles a breccia (a rock composed of angular fragments cemented together) but is formed by a different process, such as the deformation and fracturing of a pre-existing rock without significant displacement of the fragments.  Unlike true breccias, pseudobreccias typically show less angularity and less evidence of significant transport or impact.  The fragments may be connected by a matrix of similar material. |  The metamorphic rock displayed pseudobrecciation due to intense pressure.  这块变质岩由于巨大的压力而呈现假角砾结构。 The sample shows features consistent with pseudobrecciation, rather than true brecciation. 样本显示的特征与假角砾岩一致，而不是真正的角砾岩。 |  breccia, fractured rock |  conglomerate (if the fragments are rounded) |  n.
