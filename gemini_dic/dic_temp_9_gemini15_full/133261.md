词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") + "exhaustiveness," which derives from "exhaustive" (meaning "thorough, complete").  "Exhaustive" itself comes from the verb "exhaust," ultimately from Old French *exhauster (to empty, drain), from Latin *exhaurire (to draw out, drain).


用法说明:

Nonexhaustiveness is primarily used as a noun. It's often used in academic writing and technical documentation to acknowledge that a given list, set of data, or explanation is not entirely comprehensive.  It signals that there might be additional information, items, or factors not explicitly mentioned.  It is a way to avoid making claims of absolute completeness.
