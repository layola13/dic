catachresis:/ˌkætəˈkriːsɪs/| n. |辞藻滥用；语义错位；移就；比喻不当|The use of a word in a way that is not considered correct, often to create a striking or unusual effect.  It involves using a word or phrase in a way that stretches its conventional meaning, often for rhetorical effect, but sometimes due to a lack of a more precise term. This can involve metaphor, metonymy, or other figures of speech.|例句：The phrase "the leg of the table" is a catachresis because tables don't have legs in the biological sense. 桌子的“腿”就是一个辞藻滥用的例子，因为桌子在生物学意义上并没有腿。

例句：Shakespeare's use of "eye of heaven" for the sun is a classic example of catachresis. 莎士比亚用“天堂之眼”来指代太阳是辞藻滥用的经典例子。
