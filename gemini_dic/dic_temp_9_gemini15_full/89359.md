homomorphy:/həˈmɔːrfɪ/| n. |同形性，同态性 |The resemblance in form or structure between organs or parts of different organisms, due to inheritance from a common ancestor.  It refers to a similarity of structure between different species that is due to common ancestry, not convergent evolution.  Homomorphy contrasts with analogy or homoplasy, where similar structures evolve independently in unrelated organisms. | Example: The wings of bats and birds are an example of homoplasy (analogous structures), while the forelimbs of humans and bats are an example of homomorphy (homologous structures).  蝙蝠和鸟类的翅膀是同源性（类似结构）的例子，而人和蝙蝠的前肢是同形性（同源结构）的例子。|近义词：homology (in some contexts), similarity |反义词：analogy, homoplasy
