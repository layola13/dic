词源:  The word originates from the 17th-century practice of abandoning mutineers or other undesirables on remote islands.  This practice was associated with marooning individuals on islands, particularly in the Caribbean.  The word "maroon" itself comes from the Spanish word "cimarrón," meaning "wild" or "runaway," referring to runaway slaves who lived in the wilderness.  Over time, "marooning" evolved to describe the act of abandoning anyone in a desolate place, not just on islands.
