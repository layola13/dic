re-decays: /ˌriːdɪˈkeɪz/ | v. | 再衰变，重新衰变 |  The process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation. This term often refers to a secondary decay process after an initial decay event.  | Example:  After the initial alpha decay, the daughter nucleus underwent re-decays through beta emission.  再衰变发生在初始α衰变之后，子核通过β衰变再次衰变。 | 近义词：secondary decay, further decay | 反义词：decay stability (lack of further decay) | 动词


USAGE->
