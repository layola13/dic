词源:
The word "overfaint" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much") and the adjective "faint" (meaning "weak" or "unconscious").  Therefore, it literally means "excessively faint" or "too faint".  The word's origin traces back to the Old French word "feint," meaning "feigned," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "fingere," meaning "to feign" or "to shape." While the modern meaning is not directly about feigning, the connection to a weakened state is present.
