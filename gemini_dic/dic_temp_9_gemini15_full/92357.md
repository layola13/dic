hypocellular:/ˌhaɪpoʊˈsɛljələr/| adj.| 细胞减少的，细胞稀少的 | Having fewer cells than normal.  This term is often used in the context of describing tissues or blood samples.  | Example: The bone marrow biopsy showed a hypocellular pattern, indicating possible bone marrow failure. 骨髓活检显示细胞减少的模式，表明可能存在骨髓衰竭。|近义词：oligocellular, paucicellular |反义词：hypercellular


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The bone marrow is hypocellular in this patient. =  这位病人的骨髓细胞减少。
This tissue sample shows a hypocellular appearance. = 这个组织样本显示细胞稀少。


一般过去时:
The biopsy results indicated that the sample was hypocellular. = 活检结果表明样本细胞减少。
The doctor noted that the patient's blood was hypocellular. = 医生注意到病人的血液细胞减少。


现在完成时:
The patient has presented with a hypocellular bone marrow for several months. = 病人已经出现骨髓细胞减少数月了。
Researchers have found that certain conditions lead to hypocellularity. = 研究人员发现某些疾病会导致细胞减少。


过去完成时:
The analysis showed that the tissue had already been hypocellular before the treatment. = 分析表明，该组织在治疗前就已经细胞减少了。
The patient had experienced progressive hypocellularity for years. = 病人多年来经历了进行性细胞减少。


将来时:
The treatment is expected to improve the hypocellular condition. = 预计治疗将改善细胞减少的情况。
Without intervention, the bone marrow will likely become more hypocellular. =  如果不干预，骨髓可能会变得更加细胞稀少。


虚拟语气:
If the bone marrow were more hypocellular, the prognosis would be worse. = 如果骨髓细胞减少更多，预后会更差。
It is as if the tissue were hypocellular due to long-term medication. = 仿佛由于长期服药导致组织细胞减少。


被动语态:
The diagnosis of hypocellularity was confirmed by the pathologist. = 病理学家证实了细胞减少的诊断。
The effects of chemotherapy on bone marrow cellularity are often observed as hypocellularity. = 化疗对骨髓细胞的影响通常表现为细胞减少。


疑问句:
Is the hypocellularity a primary or secondary condition? = 细胞减少是原发性还是继发性疾病？
Could the hypocellular pattern be related to the patient's recent illness? = 细胞减少的模式是否与患者最近的疾病有关？


否定句:
The bone marrow was not hypocellular, but rather hypercellular. = 骨髓不是细胞减少的，而是细胞增多的。
The results did not indicate a significant degree of hypocellularity. = 结果没有显示出显著程度的细胞减少。


PHRASE->
hypocellular bone marrow = 细胞减少的骨髓
hypocellular pattern = 细胞减少的模式
degree of hypocellularity = 细胞减少程度
hypocellular anemia = 细胞减少性贫血
hypocellularity of the tissue = 组织细胞减少
