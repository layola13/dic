词源:  The word is formed from "non-" (meaning "not") and "committal" (relating to commitment). "Committal" comes from the verb "commit," which ultimately traces back to the Old French "commettre" and the Latin "committere," meaning "to entrust, to give over, to pledge."  Therefore, "non-committal" literally means "not pledging or committing."
