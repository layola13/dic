用法说明：

"Non-vanishing" is primarily used in mathematical and scientific contexts, particularly where it describes a quantity or function that does not become zero or insignificant. It emphasizes the continuous or persistent presence of something.

In less formal settings, synonyms like "persistent," "enduring," "continuing," or "lasting" might be used, depending on the specific context.  However, these synonyms may not carry the precise mathematical connotation of "non-vanishing".
