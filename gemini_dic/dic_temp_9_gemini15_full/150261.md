词源:
The term "Pandora's box" originates from Greek mythology.  Pandora, the first woman, was given a jar (often mistakenly called a box) by Zeus, which contained all the evils and misfortunes of the world.  When she opened it, these evils were released upon humanity.  The image of a container releasing unforeseen and undesirable consequences has become a common metaphor.
