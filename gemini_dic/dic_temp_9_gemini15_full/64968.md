USAGE->
This word is rare and doesn't have common usage examples across different tenses like "what".  Its usage is primarily limited to discussing the degree to which something can be estimated.  Therefore, providing examples across all tenses is inappropriate.  Instead, here are examples demonstrating its use in different sentence structures:


肯定句:
The estimablenesses of the risks involved were carefully considered.  所涉及风险的可估量性受到了仔细考虑。

否定句:
The low estimablenesses of future market trends made investors hesitant. 未来市场趋势的可估量性低，使投资者犹豫不决。

疑问句:
What are the estimablenesses of the potential benefits?  潜在利益的可估量性是多少？

比较句:
The estimablenesses of the two projects were quite different. 这两个项目的可估量性大相径庭。


PHRASE->
Because "estimablenesses" is a rarely used noun,  providing common phrases is not practical.  The word itself is the core concept, and phrases would largely be built around describing the degree of estimability of a specific thing.  For example:

high estimablenesses of... (高可估量性...)
low estimablenesses of... (低可估量性...)
the estimablenesses concerning... (关于...的可估量性)
assessing the estimablenesses of... (评估...的可估量性)
debating the estimablenesses of... (辩论...的可估量性)


词源:

Estimableness (可估量性) is derived from the adjective "estimable," which in turn comes from the verb "estimate" (估计). The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun indicating a quality or state.  "Estimate" has roots in Latin *aestimare, from *ad- (to) + *aestimare (to value, to estimate).
