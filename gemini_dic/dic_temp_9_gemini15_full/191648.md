schorl: /ʃɔːrl/ | n. | 黑电气石 | A black, opaque variety of tourmaline, a crystalline boron silicate mineral.  Schorl is the most common type of tourmaline and is typically black, although it can sometimes exhibit dark brown or greenish hues. It's known for its hardness and piezoelectric properties. | Example: The geologist identified the black mineral as schorl, a common type of tourmaline.  地质学家将这种黑色矿物鉴定为黑电气石，一种常见的电气石。| 近义词: tourmaline (general term) | 反义词: (no direct antonym, as it refers to a specific type of mineral) | 名词
