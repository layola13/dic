prebenefitted: /ˌpriːˈbɛnɪfɪtɪd/ | adj. | 预先受益的；事先获益的 |  This word is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before) and "benefitted" (past participle of "benefit"). It implies receiving benefits before a certain event or point in time.  There is no established dictionary definition or common usage.  Therefore, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage is not possible for this non-existent word.  To express the intended meaning, one would use alternative phrasing.  For example, "They preemptively benefited from the policy change" or "They received benefits in advance of the project's completion."
