词源:
The word "misprofess" is a combination of the prefix "mis-" (meaning "wrongly" or "badly") and the verb "profess" (meaning "to declare openly; to claim; to affirm").  Therefore, "misprofess" literally means "to declare wrongly" or "to falsely claim."  The word's roots trace back to the Latin word "profiteri," meaning "to declare openly."
