The word "premadnesses" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word), possibly a playful or intentionally unconventional combination of "pre-" (meaning before or in advance) and "madnesses."  Therefore, a full etymological breakdown and standard usage explanation are impossible.


To illustrate how to provide the requested information for *existing* words, let's use the word "madness":
