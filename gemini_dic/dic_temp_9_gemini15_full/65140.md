词源：
The name "Ethiopia" derives from the Greek word Αἰθιοπία (Aithiopía), ultimately from the ancient Egyptian term "ṯȝ-hwty" meaning "land of the burnt faces".  This referred to the dark-skinned inhabitants of the region.  The name was adopted by the Greeks and later used by the Romans and other Europeans.  The country itself has used various names throughout its history,  with the modern Amharic name being ኢትዮጵያ (ʾĪtyōṗṗyā).
