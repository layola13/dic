词源:

The word "reprieve" comes from the Old French word "reprieve," meaning "to take back," "to recover," or "to retake."  This in turn derives from the verb "reprendre," which combines the prefix "re-" (again) and "prendre" (to take).  The original meaning was specifically related to taking back something previously given, and this evolved to mean a taking back of a punishment or sentence.
