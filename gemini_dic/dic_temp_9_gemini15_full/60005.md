词源：

The word "editorializing" is derived from "editorial," which itself comes from the Latin word "editor," meaning "publisher" or "one who edits."  The suffix "-izing" indicates the act or process of doing something.  Therefore, "editorializing" literally means "the act of engaging in editorial work," specifically in the sense of expressing personal opinions within a context where objectivity is expected.
