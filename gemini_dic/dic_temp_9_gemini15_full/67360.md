/ɪkˌstɛnʃənəlɪzəm/ | n. | 外延论；外延主义 | Extensionalism is a philosophical position that emphasizes the importance of observable, external facts and evidence over internal mental states or subjective experiences in understanding reality. It contrasts with intensionalism, which prioritizes meaning and concepts.  Extensionalism often focuses on the observable consequences and effects of actions or beliefs, rather than their inherent nature or intention.  |  Example:  The scientist's approach to the problem was purely extensionalist; he focused solely on the measurable data, ignoring the theoretical implications.  | 近义词：empiricism, behaviorism | 反义词：intensionalism, idealism
