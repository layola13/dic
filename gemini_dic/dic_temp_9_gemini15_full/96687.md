词源:  The word "inebriated" comes from the Latin word "inebriare," meaning "to intoxicate" or "to make drunk."  It's a combination of the prefix "in-" (meaning "in" or "into") and "ebrius" (meaning "drunk").  The word evolved through Middle French and Middle English before reaching its current form.
