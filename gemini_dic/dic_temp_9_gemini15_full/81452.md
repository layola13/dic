词源:  Derived from the adjective "grating," which means harsh or unpleasant to the ear or touch.  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb.  The root is likely connected to the Old English word "gratan," meaning "to rub" or "scrape."  This reflects the sense of something causing friction or irritation.
