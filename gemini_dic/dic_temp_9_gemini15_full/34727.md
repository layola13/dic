clickjacking: /ˈklɪkdʒækɪŋ/ | n. | 点击劫持 |  A malicious technique where a website user is tricked into clicking something different from what the user perceives they are clicking.  This is achieved by embedding an invisible or cleverly disguised iframe containing the target website on a deceptive page. The attacker can then use the user's clicks on the hidden iframe to perform actions on the target site, such as making purchases, changing settings, or stealing data, without the user's knowledge or consent. | Example:  The attacker used clickjacking to make unauthorized purchases on the victim's online banking account by overlaying a seemingly harmless image over the actual "submit" button.  | 近义词: UI redressing,  hidden iframe attack | 反义词:  None (it's a type of attack, not a state) |  n.
