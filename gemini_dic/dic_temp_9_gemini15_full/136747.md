WORD ORIGIN->

The word "nonsensuousness" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "sensuousness".  "Sensuousness" derives from the adjective "sensuous," ultimately tracing back to the Latin word "sensualis," meaning "pertaining to the senses."  Therefore, "nonsensuousness" signifies the absence or lack of qualities associated with the senses, implying a detachment from physical or sensory experiences.
