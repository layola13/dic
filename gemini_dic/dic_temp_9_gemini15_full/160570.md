porpentine:/ˈpɔːrpənˌtaɪn/| n. |毒蛇；（古）多刺的动物|A porpentine is an archaic and now largely obsolete word for a porcupine.  The term is derived from a misinterpretation of the original French word. While it doesn't have a direct modern English equivalent, it evokes the image of a spiky, potentially dangerous creature.|例句：The old manuscript mentioned a fearsome porpentine guarding the treasure.  = 古籍中提到一条可怕的毒蛇守护着宝藏。(Note: This uses the archaic sense of danger, not necessarily a literal porcupine.)|近义词：porcupine, hedgehog (in some contexts)|反义词：None specifically, but words suggesting harmlessness could be considered antonyms in the context of the archaic usage.
