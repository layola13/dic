neurokeratin: /ˌnʊroʊˈkɛrətɪn/ | n. | 神经角蛋白 |  A hypothetical protein, once thought to be a component of nervous tissue, similar to keratin but found in the nervous system.  Its existence is now largely disputed. |  例句：The theory of neurokeratin as a structural component of nerve fibers was once prevalent but is now considered outdated. = 神经角蛋白作为神经纤维结构成分的理论曾经盛行，但现在已被认为过时了。


近义词：There are no true synonyms as the existence of neurokeratin is questionable.  Terms related to nervous system proteins might be considered loosely related, depending on context.


反义词：N/A (due to the lack of confirmed existence)


词性: 名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:

There is no definitive proof of neurokeratin's existence. = 没有神经角蛋白存在的明确证据。


PHRASE->
The term "neurokeratin" is rarely used in modern scientific literature, so there are no common phrases.  Instead, related terms are used, such as:

neurofilament proteins
nervous system proteins
glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)
myelin basic protein (MBP)
axonal proteins
