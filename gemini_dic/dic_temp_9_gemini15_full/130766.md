英文解析:The word "nonanalogous" means lacking analogy; not comparable. It indicates a lack of similarity or correspondence between two things that might otherwise be expected to be related.  It implies a significant difference rather than just a minor variation.

词源:

The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "analogous," which derives from the Greek words "ana-" (meaning "up," "again," or "through") and "logos" (meaning "word," "reason," or "ratio").  "Analogous" originally referred to a relationship of proportion or similarity, often in a reasoned or logical sense.  Therefore, "nonanalogous" directly negates this sense of similarity.
