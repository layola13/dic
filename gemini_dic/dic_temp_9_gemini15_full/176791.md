词源:
The word "readjust" is formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") to the word "adjust."  "Adjust" itself comes from the Old French word "ajuster," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "ad-" (to) + "iustare" (to make right, to arrange).  Therefore, "readjust" literally means "to adjust again" or "to make right again."
