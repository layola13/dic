nondecasyllable:/ˌnɒndeˈkæsɪləbəl/ | n. | 十一音节词 | A word of eleven syllables.  This is a relatively rare word formation and is primarily used in linguistic contexts to describe words with a specific syllabic structure.  It is formed from the combining forms "non-" (nine) + "deca-" (ten) + "-syllable" (syllable). Note that the prefix "non-" in this context doesn't mean "not," but rather acts as a numerical prefix indicating nine + two. | The word "floccinaucinihilipilification" is sometimes cited as an example of a nondecasyllable, though its syllable count is debated. | 近义词:  (None readily available, as this is a specific technical term.) | 反义词: (None readily available, as this describes a specific characteristic) |  词性: noun


USAGE->
This word doesn't have a typical usage in everyday conversation or writing. Its use is highly specialized and restricted to discussions of linguistics, phonetics, or metrics (poetry).  Therefore, providing examples of grammatical tenses and moods would be artificial and unhelpful.  The word itself is the subject of the sentence.
