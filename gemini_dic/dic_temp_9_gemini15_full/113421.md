lymphocytes:/ˈlɪmfəsaɪts/| n. |淋巴细胞|A type of white blood cell that is part of the body's immune system. Lymphocytes are crucial for fighting off infections and diseases.  They are produced in the bone marrow and lymph nodes. There are several types of lymphocytes, including B cells, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, each with specific roles in the immune response. |Example:  The doctor ordered a blood test to check the patient's lymphocyte count.|近义词: leukocytes, white blood cells|反义词:N/A

USAGE->
一般现在时:
Lymphocytes fight infections. = 淋巴细胞对抗感染。
The body produces lymphocytes in the bone marrow. = 身体在骨髓中产生淋巴细胞。


一般过去时:
The lab technician counted the lymphocytes in the sample. = 实验室技师计算了样本中的淋巴细胞数量。
My immune system produced more lymphocytes to fight the virus. = 我的免疫系统产生了更多的淋巴细胞来对抗病毒。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several types of lymphocytes. = 科学家已经鉴定了几种类型的淋巴细胞。
Researchers have studied the role of lymphocytes in immune responses. = 研究人员研究了淋巴细胞在免疫反应中的作用。


过去完成时:
The patient’s lymphocyte count had dropped significantly before the treatment. = 在治疗之前，病人的淋巴细胞计数显著下降。
The infection had already weakened the patient’s lymphocytes. = 感染已经削弱了病人的淋巴细胞。


将来时:
Researchers will continue to study the functions of lymphocytes. = 研究人员将继续研究淋巴细胞的功能。
New treatments will target specific types of lymphocytes. = 新疗法将针对特定类型的淋巴细胞。


虚拟语气:
If the patient had more lymphocytes, the infection would have been less severe. = 如果病人有更多淋巴细胞，感染就不会那么严重。
It is important that the lymphocytes function properly. = 淋巴细胞正常运作非常重要。


被动语态:
Lymphocytes are produced in the bone marrow. = 淋巴细胞在骨髓中产生。
The lymphocyte count was monitored closely. = 淋巴细胞计数被密切监测。


疑问句:
What are the different types of lymphocytes? = 淋巴细胞有哪些不同类型？
How do lymphocytes recognize foreign invaders? = 淋巴细胞如何识别外来入侵者？


否定句:
The patient did not have enough lymphocytes to fight the infection. = 病人没有足够的淋巴细胞来对抗感染。
Lymphocytes alone cannot cure all diseases. = 淋巴细胞本身无法治愈所有疾病。


PHRASE->
lymphocyte count = 淋巴细胞计数
lymphocyte depletion = 淋巴细胞减少
lymphocyte activation = 淋巴细胞活化
lymphocyte proliferation = 淋巴细胞增殖
lymphocyte differentiation = 淋巴细胞分化

词源:
From lympho- (lymph) + -cyte (cell).  The word ultimately derives from Latin *lympha ("clear water," "pure water").
