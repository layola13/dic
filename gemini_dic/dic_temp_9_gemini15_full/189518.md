词源:
The word "salamander" has a complex etymology, ultimately deriving from the ancient Greek word σαλαμάνδρα (salamandra).  The Greek word was associated with mythical creatures believed to inhabit fire.  The association with fire persisted in later languages, contributing to the common image of salamanders as fire-resistant creatures.  The modern scientific understanding of salamanders as amphibians developed much later.
