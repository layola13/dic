词源:
The word "rebukingly" is derived from the verb "rebuke," which comes from the Old French word "rebuker," meaning "to repulse, to refuse."  The "-ing" suffix transforms the verb into a present participle, which then functions as an adverb with the addition of the "-ly" suffix.  The root is likely related to the Latin word "re" (back, again) and a word related to "push."
