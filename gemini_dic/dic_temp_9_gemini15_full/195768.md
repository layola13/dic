semivocal:/ˈsemiˌvoʊkəl/| adj.| 半元音的 |A semivocal is a sound that is produced with less obstruction of airflow than a vowel, but more than a consonant.  It is also known as a glide. Semivocals function as consonants in some contexts and vowels in others.  They are typically articulated with a relatively open vocal tract, allowing for a smooth transition between adjacent sounds. | The "y" in "yes" and the "w" in "wet" are examples of semivocals. |近义词：glide, approximant |反义词：vowel (in terms of strict categorization), consonant (in terms of function)|


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The "y" in "yes" functions as a semivocal. = “yes”中的“y”起半元音作用。
The "w" in "wet" acts as a semivocal sound. = “wet”中的“w”充当半元音。


一般过去时:
The "y" sound in yesterday was a semivocal. = 昨天中的“y”音是一个半元音。
The "w" sound in "flowed" functioned as a semivocal. = "flowed"中的"w"音起半元音作用。


现在完成时:
Phoneticians have classified "y" and "w" as semivocals. = 语音学家已将“y”和“w”归类为半元音。
Linguists have long recognized the semivocal nature of these sounds. = 语言学家长期以来已经认识到这些声音的半元音性质。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, they had not considered "y" a semivocal. = 在分析之前，他们没有认为“y”是半元音。
Scholars had previously debated the classification of semivocals. = 学者们之前曾就半元音的分类进行过辩论。


将来时:
Future research will likely further refine our understanding of semivocals. = 未来的研究可能会进一步完善我们对半元音的理解。
Linguists will continue to study the subtle variations in semivocal sounds. = 语言学家将继续研究半元音的细微变化。


虚拟语气:
If "y" were a full vowel, the pronunciation would be different. = 如果“y”是一个完全的元音，发音就会不同。
I wish I had understood the semivocal aspects earlier. = 我希望我早点理解半元音的方面。


被动语态:
The sounds were classified as semivocals by the researchers. = 研究人员将这些声音归类为半元音。
The nature of semivocals is often misunderstood. = 半元音的性质经常被误解。


疑问句:
Are "y" and "w" always considered semivocals? = “y”和“w”总是被认为是半元音吗？
What are the acoustic properties of semivocals? = 半元音的声学特性是什么？


否定句:
"Y" and "w" are not always considered true consonants. = “y”和“w”并不总是被认为是真正的辅音。
These sounds are not simply vowels or consonants. = 这些声音不仅仅是元音或辅音。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "semivocal".  The term is primarily used in linguistic analysis.  Instead, examples would illustrate its usage within phonetic descriptions. For example:
The semivocal glide in "yellow". =  "yellow"中的半元音滑音。
The semivocal articulation of "w". = "w"的半元音发音。
The function of semivocals in English. = 半元音在英语中的作用。
The acoustic analysis of semivocals. = 半元音的声学分析。
The classification of semivocals. = 半元音的分类。
