The word "polary" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  It's possible it's:

* **A misspelling:** Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps you could provide more context where you encountered this word.
* **A neologism or technical term:**  It might be a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field.  If this is the case, please provide the context.
* **A word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.


Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.
