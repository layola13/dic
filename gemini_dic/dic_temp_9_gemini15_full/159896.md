polymyodous:/ˌpɒliˈmaɪədəs/ | adj. | 多肌的 | Having many muscles.  This term is typically used in a biological context, referring to organisms or body parts with a high number of muscles.  | Example: The polymyodous nature of the insect's leg allowed for intricate movement.  多肌的昆虫腿部结构使其能够进行复杂的运动。 | 近义词: multi-muscular (less common) | 反义词: monomyodous (having a single muscle)
