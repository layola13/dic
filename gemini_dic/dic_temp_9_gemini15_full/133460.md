词源:
The word "nonfeasibility" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "feasibility" (meaning "the state or quality of being feasible; practicability").  "Feasible" itself comes from the Old French "faisable," derived from the verb "faire" (to do, make).  Thus, nonfeasibility literally means "not being able to be done or made."
