heterosis:/ˌhɛtəˈroʊsɪs/ | n. |杂种优势，异种优势 |The superior performance of hybrid offspring compared to their parents.  This phenomenon is also known as hybrid vigor. It's often observed in plants and animals where crossbreeding results in offspring with increased size, strength, yield, or other desirable traits. | Example:  The farmer observed significant heterosis in his corn crop after cross-pollinating different varieties.  这个农民在他不同品种的玉米进行异花授粉后，观察到显著的杂种优势。

|近义词：hybrid vigor,  |反义词：inbreeding depression |
