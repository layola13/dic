flowabilities:/ˌfloʊəˈbɪlətiz/| n. |流动性，易流动性 |The ability of a substance to flow.  This term is often used in materials science and engineering to describe the ease with which a material can be deformed or shaped.  It's influenced by factors like viscosity, temperature, and particle size. |例句：The high flowabilities of the molten metal allowed for efficient casting. 高熔融金属的流动性使得铸造效率很高。

The low flowabilities of the cement mixture made it difficult to pump. 水泥混合物的低流动性使得泵送困难。|近义词：fluidity, pourbility, runnability |反义词：viscosity, stickiness

词源:
The word "flowabilities" is derived from the noun "flow" and the suffix "-abilities."  "Flow" originates from Old English *fleogan, meaning "to flow" or "to glide," related to the Proto-Germanic *fleugan and further back to Proto-Indo-European *pleu-. The suffix "-abilities" indicates the state or quality of being able to flow.
