Word Origin:

The word "ranknesses" is derived from "rank," meaning "high in position or status," which ultimately comes from Old French "ranc" and earlier Germanic roots associated with rows or lines. The suffix "-ness" indicates a state or quality, making "rankness" a noun signifying the state of being rank.  The addition of "-es" makes it plural.  The meaning has broadened to include a strong degree of something, often something unpleasant or undesirable, beyond just social hierarchy.
