词源:
The word "rinse" comes from the Old French word "rincer," meaning "to cleanse," which itself has roots in the Latin word "rescindo," meaning "to cut off, cut back, or untie."  The original sense implied a thorough cleaning, suggesting a separation or removal of something unwanted.  Over time, the meaning evolved to specifically denote washing with water.
