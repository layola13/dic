词源:

The word "ruffian" ultimately derives from the Middle French word "ruffien," meaning "bully, cheat," which itself originates from the Old Italian "ruffiano," also meaning "pimp, cheat, swindler."  These words likely connect to the Old French "ruf," meaning "rough, rude," which ultimately points towards a Proto-Germanic root suggesting a connection to words signifying a rough or unpolished quality.
