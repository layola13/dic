词源:
The word "kid" as a noun referring to a young goat ultimately derives from the Old English word *cȳð.  The use of "kid" to refer to a child is thought to be a later development, possibly a shortening of "kidling," a diminutive of "kid."  The verb sense, meaning to tease or joke, is a further extension of the meaning.
