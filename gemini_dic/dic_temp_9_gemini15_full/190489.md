词源:
The word "satanicalness" is derived from "satanic" (撒旦的，恶魔的), which in turn comes from "Satan" (撒旦), the name of the adversary in Christian theology. The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun indicating a state, quality, or condition.  Therefore, "satanicalness" refers to the quality or state of being satanic.
