churnabilities:/ˌtʃɜːrnəˈbɪlətiz/| n.|搅动能力；可搅动性|The word "churnabilities" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a neologism, likely formed by combining "churn" (to stir or agitate vigorously) and "-abilities" (a suffix indicating capacities or capabilities).  Therefore, a definition must be inferred from its component parts. It would refer to the qualities or capacities related to the ability to churn or be churned; the degree to which something can be agitated or stirred.|The cream's churnabilities were excellent, resulting in a smooth, delicious butter.  (奶油的可搅动性极佳，做出来的黄油又滑又好吃。)|近义词:agitation capabilities, stirring potential|反义词:immobility, unmixability
