photosynthesises:/ˌfoʊtoʊˈsɪnθəsaɪzɪz/| v.|光合作用|The process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll.|例句：Plants photosynthesise to produce their own food. 植物进行光合作用以制造自身食物。

例句：The algae in the pond photosynthesise efficiently. 池塘里的藻类高效地进行光合作用。


近义词：photosynthesize (less formal)


反义词：None (the opposite would be a process that doesn't produce food from light, but there isn't one single word for that)


词性:verb


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Plants photosynthesise using sunlight and water. = 植物利用阳光和水进行光合作用。
Algae photosynthesise more efficiently in clear water. = 在清澈的水中，藻类进行光合作用的效率更高。


一般过去时:
The plants photosynthesised rapidly in the bright sunlight. = 在明亮的阳光下，植物迅速地进行了光合作用。
The experiment showed that the leaves photosynthesised less in the shade. = 实验表明，叶子在阴凉处的光合作用较少。


现在完成时:
The plants have photosynthesised enough food for the winter. = 植物已经进行了足够的光合作用来储存过冬的食物。
Scientists have photosynthesised artificial food using sunlight and water. = 科学家已经利用阳光和水人工合成了食物。


过去完成时:
The plant had photosynthesised less before the drought. = 在干旱之前，植物的光合作用较少。
The researchers had photosynthesised a new type of biofuel before the conference. = 研究人员在会议之前已经合成了一种新型生物燃料。


将来时:
The plants will photosynthesise more quickly with increased carbon dioxide levels. = 随着二氧化碳浓度的增加，植物的光合作用会加快。
We predict that the algae will photosynthesise better in the new tank. = 我们预测藻类在新水箱中会更好地进行光合作用。


虚拟语气:
If the plants photosynthesised more efficiently, we could produce more food. = 如果植物的光合作用效率更高，我们就能生产更多食物。
If the leaves had photosynthesised more, the plant would have grown taller. = 如果叶子进行的光合作用更多，植物就会长得更高。


被动语态:
Oxygen is photosynthesised by plants. = 氧气是由植物进行光合作用产生的。
Food is photosynthesised by plants using sunlight. = 食物是由植物利用阳光进行光合作用产生的。


疑问句:
Does this plant photosynthesise effectively? = 这棵植物的光合作用有效吗？
How efficiently do these algae photosynthesise? = 这些藻类的光合作用效率如何？


否定句:
The plant didn't photosynthesise well due to the lack of sunlight. = 由于缺乏阳光，植物的光合作用不好。
The experiment showed that the leaves did not photosynthesise effectively in the dark. = 实验表明，叶子在黑暗中无法有效地进行光合作用。


PHRASE->
There are not many common phrases directly using "photosynthesises"  as it's a scientific term.  Phrases would typically revolve around the process itself.  Examples:

efficiently photosynthesise: 高效地进行光合作用
rate of photosynthesis: 光合作用速率
photosynthesis process: 光合作用过程
artificial photosynthesis: 人工光合作用
photosynthetic organisms: 光合生物


词源:
From "photo-" (light) + "synthesis" (putting together).  It describes the process of creating something (sugars) from light.
