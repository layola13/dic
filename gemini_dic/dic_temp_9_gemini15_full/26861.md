词源:
The word "cajole" comes from the Old French word "cajouler," which meant "to chatter" or "to babble."  This ultimately derives from a Vulgar Latin word of uncertain origin, possibly related to terms meaning "to caress" or "to stroke."  The meaning shifted over time from simply talking to skillfully persuading through flattery and coaxing.
