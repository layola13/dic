词源:
The word "what" originates from the Old English word "hwæt," which also meant "what."  Its origins trace back to Proto-Germanic and even further to Proto-Indo-European roots, sharing ancestry with words expressing interrogation and questioning in many other languages.  The modern spelling and pronunciation evolved over centuries of linguistic change.
