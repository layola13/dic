self-ionization: /ˌsɛlfˌaɪənaɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 自电离 | The process by which a molecule of a substance spontaneously ionizes into a cation and an anion.  This is often seen in pure liquids, especially water, where a small fraction of molecules dissociate into hydronium (H₃O⁺) and hydroxide (OH⁻) ions. | Example: The self-ionization of water is an equilibrium reaction, with a small but significant concentration of ions present even in pure water. 水的自电离是一个平衡反应，即使在纯水中也存在少量但重要的离子浓度。| 近义词：autoionization | 反义词：N/A
