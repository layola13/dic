词源:
The word "extroversions" is derived from "extroversion," which itself comes from the combination of the prefix "extra-" (meaning "outside" or "beyond") and the verb "to revert" (meaning "to turn back").  The original psychological concept referred to the turning of one's attention outwards, towards external stimuli and social interaction, as opposed to introversion, which focuses inwards.  The "-sion" suffix indicates a state or process.  Therefore, "extroversions" signifies multiple instances or aspects of this outward-focused personality trait.
