词源:
The word "rockingly" is derived from the adjective "rocking," which itself has a dual etymology.  In the sense of "excellent" or "stylish," it's a relatively recent development associated with rock music culture. In the sense of "moving to and fro," it comes from the verb "to rock," which has Old English roots.  The "-ly" suffix is a common adverbial suffix in English, transforming adjectives into adverbs.
