词源:
The term "cross-dressing" is a compound word. "Cross" here means "to go across" or "to go beyond," indicating a transgression of gender norms. "Dressing" refers to the act of putting on clothes.  Therefore, "cross-dressing" literally means dressing in a way that crosses or transcends traditional gender boundaries.  The term emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, reflecting evolving societal understandings of gender.
