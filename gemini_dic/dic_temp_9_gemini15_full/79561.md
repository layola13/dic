The word "glones" is not a word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible this is:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you intended another word.  Could you double-check the spelling or provide more context where you encountered this word?
* **A neologism:** A newly coined word not yet widely accepted.
* **A proper noun:** A name or place name not found in common dictionaries.
* **A word from a specific dialect or jargon:**  A word used within a particular community or field.


To provide the analysis you requested, I need a valid English word.  Please clarify.
