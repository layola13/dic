词性:形容词


词源:
The word "miserably" is derived from the adjective "miserable," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "miserable," meaning "wretched, pitiable."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "miser," meaning "wretched, unhappy,"  combined with the suffix "-able," indicating a capability or tendency.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, modifying verbs and adjectives to indicate manner or degree.
