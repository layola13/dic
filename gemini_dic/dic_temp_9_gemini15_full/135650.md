词源：

The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "predicative," which is derived from the word "predicate."  "Predicate" comes from the Latin word "praedicare," meaning "to proclaim, preach, assert."  Therefore, "nonpredicative" literally means "not asserting" or "not forming part of the assertion" in a sentence.
