markedness:/ˈmɑːrkɪdnəs/ | /ˈmɑːrkɪdnɪs/ | n. | 显著性；标记性；突出性 | The inherent prominence or salience of a linguistic element compared to others in a system.  This prominence can be phonetic, phonological, semantic, or syntactic.  For example, in English, the voiced consonants /b/, /d/, /g/ are often considered marked compared to their voiceless counterparts /p/, /t/, /k/, as voicing is an added feature.  Markedness is a key concept in phonology, morphology, and syntax, helping to explain why certain linguistic forms are more common or easier to learn than others.  It's often contrasted with unmarkedness. |  The markedness of the /r/ sound in American English compared to British English is a frequent topic of discussion.  The high degree of markedness of certain grammatical structures can lead to errors in language acquisition. | 近义词：prominence, salience, distinctiveness | 反义词：unmarkedness
