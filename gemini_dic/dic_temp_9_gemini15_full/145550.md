词源:

The word "overcommunicating" is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to a greater extent than is necessary) and "communicating" (the act of conveying information or expressing thoughts).  The root of "communicate" comes from the Latin word "communicare," meaning "to share," "to impart," or "to make common."
