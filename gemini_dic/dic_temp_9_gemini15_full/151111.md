This word is extremely rare and not commonly used in everyday English.  It's a noun formed from the adjective "parasitical" by adding the suffix "-ness," which indicates a state or quality.  Therefore, it refers to the multiple instances or aspects of parasitic behavior or characteristics.  There's no widely established usage, and the word feels overly academic and cumbersome.  A simpler alternative would usually be preferred.


There are no standard grammatical examples to be provided for such an uncommon and rarely used word.  Grammatical constructions would mirror those of any other plural noun. For example:


* **Plural possessive:** The parasiticalnesses of the various species were documented. (各种物种的寄生性都被记录在案。)
* **Use with a verb:** The parasiticalnesses in the garden are becoming a problem. (花园里的寄生现象正成为一个问题。)
* **Use with prepositions:**  The report detailed the parasiticalnesses within the host organism. (报告详细描述了寄主生物体内的寄生现象。)
* **Use with adjectives:**  The numerous parasiticalnesses observed require immediate action. (观察到的众多寄生现象需要立即采取行动。)

The word lacks common phrases or idioms because of its rarity.  It's best to avoid using this word unless in a highly specialized context where precision demands its usage.  Simpler alternatives like "parasitic behaviors," "parasitism," or "parasitic characteristics" are significantly more suitable for most purposes.
