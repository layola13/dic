词源:  The word is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "melodramatic."  "Melodramatic" itself comes from "melodrama," a genre of drama characterized by exaggerated emotions, sensational plots, and musical accompaniment.  "Melodrama" is a combination of "melo-" (from Greek "melos," meaning "song, melody") and "drama."
