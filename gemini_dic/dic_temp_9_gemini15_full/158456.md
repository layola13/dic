Etymology:

The word "plectognathic" is derived from the Greek words:

* **plektos** (πλεκτός): meaning "plaited," "interwoven," or "braided"
* **gnathos** (γνάθος): meaning "jaw"

Therefore, "plectognathic" literally refers to having "braided" or "fused" jaws.  This accurately describes the characteristic fused jaw structure of the fish group.


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in a scientific context, specifically in ichthyology (the study of fish).  Therefore, grammatical examples in various tenses are less relevant than a focus on how it's used to describe fish.
