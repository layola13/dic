The word "overobjectification" is a compound word. It combines the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessive") with "objectification," which is derived from "object" (a thing) and the suffix "-ification" (meaning "the process of making something into").  Therefore, it literally means "the process of making something excessively into an object."
