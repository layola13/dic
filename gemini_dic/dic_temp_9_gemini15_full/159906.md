polynucleolar:/ˌpɒliˌnjuːkliˈəʊlə(r)/| adj. |多核仁的|Having or relating to multiple nucleoli.  Polynucleolar cells are characterized by the presence of more than one nucleolus per nucleus. This can be an indicator of certain cellular processes or conditions.  |例句：The polynucleolar cells were observed under the microscope. 显微镜下观察到多核仁细胞。The study showed a correlation between polynucleolar activity and increased cell growth. 研究表明多核仁活性与细胞生长增加之间存在相关性。|近义词：multinucleolate |反义词：mononucleolar

词源:
* **poly-**:  from Greek πολύς (polús), meaning "many" or "much".
* **nucleol-**: from Latin *nucleolus*, the diminutive of *nucleus*, meaning "kernel" or "little nut".  This refers to the nucleolus within the cell nucleus.
* **-ar**: adjectival suffix indicating "relating to" or "characterized by".
