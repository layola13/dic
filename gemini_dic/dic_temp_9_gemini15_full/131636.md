词源:
The word "noncomprehensive" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "comprehensive" (meaning "including all or nearly all elements or aspects of something").  "Comprehensive" itself comes from the Latin "comprehendere," meaning "to grasp, to understand fully."
