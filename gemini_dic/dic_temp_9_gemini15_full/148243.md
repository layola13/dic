(overskeptically本身就是一个完整的词，没有常用的短语搭配)


词源:
The word "overskeptically" is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively"), the adjective "skeptical" (meaning "having or showing doubt), and the adverbial suffix "-ly" (indicating manner).  Therefore, it literally means "in an excessively skeptical manner".  The root of "skeptical" traces back to the Greek word "skeptikos," meaning "inquiring," which itself comes from "skeptesthai," meaning "to look," "consider," or "examine."
