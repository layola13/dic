equinumerant: /ˌiːkwɪˈnjuːmərənt/ | adj. | 基数相同的；等势的 | Having the same cardinality; possessing the same number of elements.  Equinumerant sets are sets that can be put into one-to-one correspondence.  | The two sets are equinumerant, meaning they have the same number of elements.  两个集合是等势的，这意味着它们具有相同数量的元素。 |  equivalent, isomorphic |  disparate, unequal  |形容词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in mathematics and set theory, so typical grammatical usages in everyday conversation are limited.  The following examples demonstrate its use in formal mathematical contexts.


一般现在时:
These two sets are equinumerant. = 这两个集合是等势的。
The elements in set A are equinumerant with those in set B. = 集合A中的元素与集合B中的元素等势。


一般过去时:
The mathematicians proved that the two sets were equinumerant. = 数学家们证明了这两个集合是等势的。
We discovered that the datasets were equinumerant. = 我们发现这两个数据集是等势的。


现在完成时:
Researchers have shown that these infinite sets are equinumerant. = 研究人员已经证明了这些无限集是等势的。
We have determined that the samples are equinumerant. = 我们已经确定这些样本是等势的。


过去完成时:
They had already established that the groups were equinumerant before proceeding with the analysis. = 在进行分析之前，他们已经确定这些群是等势的。
It had been previously shown that the two collections were equinumerant. = 此前已经证明这两个集合是等势的。


将来时:
We will demonstrate that the sets are equinumerant in the next theorem. = 我们将在下一个定理中证明这些集合是等势的。
The proof will show that these structures are equinumerant. = 证明将表明这些结构是等势的。


虚拟语气:
If the sets were equinumerant, the theorem would hold true. = 如果集合是等势的，那么定理成立。
If the datasets had been equinumerant, the results would have been more consistent. = 如果数据集是等势的，结果会更一致。


被动语态:
It was shown that the groups were equinumerant. = 已经证明这些群是等势的。
The equinumerancy of the sets was confirmed by the experiment. = 实验证实了这些集合的等势性。


疑问句:
Are these two sets equinumerant? = 这两个集合是等势的吗？
Is it possible to prove that these collections are equinumerant? = 是否可以证明这些集合是等势的？


否定句:
The two sets are not equinumerant. = 这两个集合不是等势的。
It was determined that the samples were not equinumerant. = 已经确定这些样本不是等势的。


PHRASE->
Because "equinumerant" is a highly specialized term,  common phrases using it are limited to mathematical contexts.  Examples would include phrases within mathematical proofs or theorems, such as: "It follows that the sets are equinumerant...",  "We show that A and B are equinumerant by...", or "The condition of equinumerancy implies...".  It’s not commonly used in idiomatic expressions.
