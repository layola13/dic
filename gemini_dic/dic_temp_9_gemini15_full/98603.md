词源:
The word "instruction" comes from the Old French word "instruction," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "instructio," a combination of "in-" (in, into) and "struere" (to build, to arrange).  The original meaning thus suggests the act of building up or arranging something, which evolved into the modern sense of giving guidance or commands.
