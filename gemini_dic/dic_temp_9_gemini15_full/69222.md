词源:
The word "fearlessness" is derived from the word "fear" and the suffix "-lessness," which indicates the absence or lack of something.  "Fear" comes from Old English *fæger, meaning "danger, harm."  The suffix "-less" is of Old English origin, meaning "without." Therefore, fearlessness literally means "without fear."
