词源:
The word is a compound of "shirt" and "sleeves," both originating from Old English.  "Shirt" comes from "scyrte," a short tunic, while "sleeve" derives from "slefe," meaning a covering for the arm. The combined term "shirtsleeves" developed naturally to describe the sleeves of a shirt, and later gained its figurative meaning.
