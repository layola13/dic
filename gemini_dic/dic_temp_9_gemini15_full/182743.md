词源:  The word "reparable" comes from the verb "repair," which itself comes from the Old French word "repaier," meaning "to recompense, to make amends, to satisfy."  The prefix "re-" indicates doing something again or anew. Thus, "reparable" literally means "able to be repaired or made whole again."
