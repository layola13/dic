词源:
The verb "to ghost" in this sense is a relatively recent addition to the English lexicon. It's a figurative use of the word "ghost," referring to the act of disappearing like a ghost, leaving no trace.  The use of "ghost" in this way gained popularity in the early 2010s, coinciding with the rise of online dating and social media.
