re-fences:  /ˌriːˈfɛnsɪz/ | n. | 围栏；参考；参照；(尤指书中的) 脚注 |  The word "re-fences" is not a standard English word. It seems to be a misspelling or a newly coined word combining "re-" (again, back) and "fences".  If it is intended to mean "references" with a potential emphasis on the act of referring again or reviewing, its meaning would be similar to "references" or "citations", especially in academic contexts. The word "fences" itself refers to barriers, often made of wood or wire, used to enclose an area. Adding the prefix "re-" could imply rebuilding, repairing, or reconsidering fences or references. | 例句：The farmer repaired the re-fences around his property. (农民修理了他房产周围的围栏)  |近义词：references, citations, barriers, enclosures,  | 反义词：openings, gaps
