Word Origin:

The word "nondecorousnesses" is formed by combining several elements:

* **non-:**  A prefix meaning "not."
* **decorous:** An adjective meaning "proper; in accordance with accepted standards of good taste or propriety."  Derived from the French "décorum" (from Latin "decor").
* **-ness:** A suffix forming nouns of state or quality, indicating the condition of being something.
* **-es:** A plural suffix.


Therefore, "nondecorousnesses" denotes the plural instances of a lack of decorum or propriety.  It's a relatively uncommon word, used primarily in formal contexts where a precise and emphatic description of multiple instances of inappropriate behavior is required.

The word is not commonly used in everyday conversation.  More common alternatives might be "rude behaviors," "impolite acts," or simply "improprieties," depending on the specific context.  The word highlights the multiple and repeated nature of the unseemly acts.
