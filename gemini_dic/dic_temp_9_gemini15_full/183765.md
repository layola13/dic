The word "rescowe" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a proper noun (perhaps a place name or surname), or a word from a very specialized or obscure field.  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.
