nonaspirated: /ˌnɒnˈæspəreɪtɪd/ | adj. | 不送气的 |  Describes a consonant sound produced without a puff of air from the lungs.  This is in contrast to aspirated consonants, which are pronounced with a noticeable burst of air.  The difference is often subtle and can vary across languages and dialects.  Non-aspirated consonants are often found in languages like Spanish and Korean, while aspirated consonants are common in English and Hindi. |
