词源:The word "hobgoblin" is a compound word originating in the Middle English period. It combines "hob" (a variant of "hobgoblin" itself, and also possibly related to "hob" meaning "elf" or "goblin") and "goblin," both terms referring to supernatural beings.  The specific origins of "hob" are uncertain, but its association with mischievous spirits dates back centuries.  "Goblin" originates from the Middle French "gobelin," ultimately derived from a Germanic root, likely meaning something along the lines of "ghost" or "specter."
