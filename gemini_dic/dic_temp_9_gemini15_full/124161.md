The word "mortrew" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  It's possible this is:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **An archaic word:** It might be a word from an older form of English or a dialect no longer in common use.  If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it might help determine its meaning.
* **A proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (a name of a person, place, or thing) not included in general dictionaries.
* **A neologism:** It might be a newly coined word not yet widely adopted.

To help me assist you, please provide more information about where you found "mortrew" and any surrounding context.
