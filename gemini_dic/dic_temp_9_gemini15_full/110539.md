词源:
The term "limelight" originates from the 19th-century theatrical lighting technology.  Before electric lights, stage lighting was achieved using limelight, a brilliant light produced by heating a cylinder of lime with an oxyhydrogen flame. Actors performing on stage were literally "in the limelight," and the phrase came to be associated with the intense public attention given to performers.  The use of the word to mean “public attention” developed from this literal usage.
