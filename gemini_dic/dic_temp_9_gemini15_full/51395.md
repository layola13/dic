词源:
The word "determined" comes from the Old French word "determiner," meaning "to limit, bound, define," ultimately from the Latin word "determinare," which has the same meaning.  The Latin word is composed of "de-" (completely) and "terminare" (to bound, to end).  The sense of "to decide" evolved from the idea of setting a definite boundary or limit.
