词源:
The word "compartmentalize" comes from the noun "compartment," meaning a separate section or division within a larger structure.  "Compartment" itself derives from the French word "compartiment," ultimately from the Latin "compartir" (to share, divide). The "-ize" suffix is added to transform the noun into a verb, indicating the action of dividing into compartments.
