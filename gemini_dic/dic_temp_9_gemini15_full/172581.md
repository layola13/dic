pyrometric:/ˌpaɪrəˈmɛtrɪk/ | adj. |测温的，高温测量的 | Relating to the measurement of high temperatures.  Pyrometric methods are used in various industrial processes to monitor and control temperatures in furnaces and other high-temperature environments. | Example:  The pyrometric readings indicated that the furnace had reached the desired temperature. = 测温读数表明炉子已达到所需温度。  The engineer used a pyrometric device to measure the temperature of the molten steel. = 工程师使用测温设备测量熔融钢的温度。 | 近义词: thermometric (for lower temperatures) | 反义词:  None directly opposite, but  'non-pyrometric' could be used to describe methods not involving high-temperature measurement.
