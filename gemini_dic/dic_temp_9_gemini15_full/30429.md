词源:  From Late Middle English *centralisacioun, from Old French centralisacion, from centraliser ‘to centralize’, from Latin centrum ‘centre’ + -alis + -ation.  The Latin root "centrum" ultimately derives from the Greek word "kéntron," meaning "a sharp point, sting, spur." The evolution of meaning reflects the idea of a central point of control or activity radiating outwards.
