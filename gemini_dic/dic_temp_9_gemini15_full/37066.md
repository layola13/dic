词源:

The word "combatively" is derived from the adjective "combative," which in turn originates from the noun "combat."  "Combat" comes from the Old French word "combatre," meaning "to fight" or "to battle." This Old French word itself descends from the Late Latin "combattere," a compound of "cum" (with) and "battere" (to beat).  Thus, "combatively" traces its roots back to the fundamental concept of physical or verbal fighting.
