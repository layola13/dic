/diːˈpiː/ | n. | 动态规划 | Dynamic programming is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing their solutions to avoid redundant computations.  | Example: Dynamic programming is often used in optimization problems. 动态规划常用于优化问题。 | 近义词：optimization, recursion | 反义词：brute force  | 名词
