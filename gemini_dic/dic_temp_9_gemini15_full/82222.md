词源:

The word "grottoes" comes from the Italian word "grotta," meaning "cave."  The Italian word itself has roots in the Vulgar Latin *crūpta,  a derivative of the classical Latin "crypta," meaning "vault," "crypt," or "underground chamber."  Thus, the word's history traces back to the Roman understanding of subterranean spaces.
