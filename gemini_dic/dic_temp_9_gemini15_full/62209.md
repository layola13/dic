词源:

The word "encourager" is derived from the verb "encourage," which comes from the Old French word "encorager," meaning "to give courage to" or "to hearten."  The prefix "en-" means "in" or "into," and the root "-courage" comes from the Latin word "cor," meaning "heart."  Therefore, the word literally means "to put heart into."
