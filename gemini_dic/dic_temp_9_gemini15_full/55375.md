The word "distasting" is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "the opposite of") and the word "tasting."  While "tasting" typically refers to the act of experiencing flavor, in this context it implies something unpleasant to the senses, leading to a feeling of dislike.  Therefore, "distasting" signifies something that is unpleasant to the senses, especially the sense of taste, and produces revulsion or disgust.
