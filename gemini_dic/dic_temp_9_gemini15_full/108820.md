词源:

The phrase is a combination of common English words with a long history.  "Leave" has Old English roots, as does "alone." "Well enough" reflects the common use of "well" as an adverb modifying an adjective or adverb. The phrase's meaning developed over time as a proverb, reflecting a cautionary approach to unnecessary intervention.  There isn't a single identifiable origin point, but rather a gradual emergence into common usage.
