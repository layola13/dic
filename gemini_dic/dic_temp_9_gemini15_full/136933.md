USAGE->
This word is a relatively uncommon and complex noun.  It doesn't lend itself to typical grammatical tense conjugations like "What" in the example.  Instead, we'll focus on how it functions in sentences.


Example Sentences:

The architect's plans addressed the building's many nonspaciousnesses. 建筑师的方案解决了建筑物的许多狭窄之处。

The city's numerous nonspaciousnesses contributed to its feeling of overcrowding. 城市的众多狭窄之处导致其感觉过度拥挤。


PHRASE->

lack of space
confined quarters
cramped conditions
limited room
small spaces
