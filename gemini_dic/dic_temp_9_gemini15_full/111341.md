词源:
The word "livelihood" comes from the Old English "lifelāc," which combines "līf" (life) and "lāc" (play, game, manner, conduct, or offering).  The modern sense evolved from the idea of the "manner of life" or "way of living" one sustains.  The "-hood" suffix, common in English, signifies state or condition.  Therefore, "livelihood" originally meant the manner in which one lived and has gradually narrowed to mean the means of supporting oneself.
