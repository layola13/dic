词源:  The word "detachments" comes from the verb "detach," which is formed from the Old French prefix "de-" (meaning "off" or "away") and the Old French word "tacher" (meaning "to fasten" or "to attach"). Thus, "detach" originally meant "to unfasten" or "to separate."  The "-ment" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, indicating the action or state of being detached.
