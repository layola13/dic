词源:

Championing ultimately derives from the Old French word "champion," meaning "battlefield champion," "knight," or "fighter."  This word further traces back to the Latin "campus," meaning "field" or "plain." The sense evolved from a literal battlefield champion to a figurative champion of a cause or idea.
