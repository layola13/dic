reamends is not a valid English word.  There is no word with that spelling in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or word class.  To get a helpful response, please double-check the spelling of the word you intended to ask about.
