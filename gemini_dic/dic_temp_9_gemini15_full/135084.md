词源:

The word "nonobjectification" is a relatively modern term formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with "objectification".  "Objectification" itself comes from "object" (a thing) and the suffix "-ification" (meaning "the act or process of").  Therefore, "nonobjectification" literally means "not treating someone as an object." The concept itself has roots in feminist philosophy and related fields concerned with ethical treatment of persons and combating dehumanization.
