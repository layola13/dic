词源:
The word "butcherer" is derived from the word "butcher," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "boc" (meaning "male goat") and "bouc" (meaning "billy goat"), along with the Old North French word "boche," which meant "slaughtering animal." The "-er" suffix is an agent suffix indicating a person who performs the action.  Over time, the word evolved to refer to someone who slaughters and sells meat, regardless of the animal.
