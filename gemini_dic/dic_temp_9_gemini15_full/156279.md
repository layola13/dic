phyllome:/ˈfaɪloʊm/| n. |叶状体，叶状器官|A phyllome is a botanical term referring to any leaf-like structure in plants, including leaves, bracts, sepals, petals, and stamens.  It encompasses all appendages arising from the plant stem that are generally considered to be modified leaves.  The term emphasizes the evolutionary homology of these diverse structures, suggesting they all derive from a common ancestral leaf form.|Example: The petals of a rose are phyllomes, modified leaves specialized for attracting pollinators.|近义词:leaf (in some contexts), appendage|反义词:N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The petals are phyllomes. = 花瓣是叶状体。
This plant displays modified phyllomes. = 这株植物展示了变形的叶状体。

一般过去时:
Scientists studied the phyllomes of ancient plants. = 科学家研究了古代植物的叶状体。
The botanist identified the phyllomes as bracts. = 植物学家将这些叶状体鉴定为苞片。

现在完成时:
Researchers have analyzed the genetic basis of phyllome development. = 研究人员已经分析了叶状体发育的遗传基础。
Botany has long classified various structures as phyllomes. = 植物学长期以来将各种结构归类为叶状体。

过去完成时:
Before the discovery, they had not understood the phyllome's function. = 在发现之前，他们不了解叶状体的功能。
They had already classified those structures as phyllomes. = 他们已经将这些结构归类为叶状体。

将来时:
Scientists will further investigate the phyllome's evolution. = 科学家将进一步研究叶状体的进化。
We will use this model to predict phyllome development. = 我们将使用这个模型来预测叶状体的发育。

虚拟语气:
If these were phyllomes, they would exhibit certain characteristics. = 如果这些是叶状体，它们将表现出某些特征。
I wish I knew more about the diverse forms of phyllomes. = 我希望我能更多地了解叶状体的多样形式。

被动语态:
The phyllomes were carefully examined under a microscope. = 叶状体在显微镜下被仔细检查。
The evolutionary origins of phyllomes are being actively researched. = 叶状体的进化起源正在积极研究中。

疑问句:
Are these structures truly phyllomes? = 这些结构真的是叶状体吗？
What are the key characteristics distinguishing different types of phyllomes? = 区分不同类型叶状体的关键特征是什么？

否定句:
Those appendages are not phyllomes; they are modified stems. = 那些附属物不是叶状体；它们是变形的茎。
The classification of these structures as phyllomes is not universally accepted. = 将这些结构分类为叶状体并非普遍被接受。


PHRASE->
types of phyllomes = 叶状体的类型
development of phyllomes = 叶状体的发育
evolution of phyllomes = 叶状体的进化
modified phyllomes = 变形的叶状体
functions of phyllomes = 叶状体的功能
