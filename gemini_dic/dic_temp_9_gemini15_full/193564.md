self-alignments:/ˌsɛlf əˈlaɪnmənts/| n. | 自对齐，自我校准 | Self-alignments refer to the processes or mechanisms by which a system or component automatically adjusts its position or orientation to achieve a desired configuration or alignment. This often involves feedback mechanisms and error correction to ensure accuracy.  | Example: The gyroscopes in the spacecraft provide continuous self-alignments, ensuring accurate navigation.  自动对准系统确保飞船精确导航。|近义词：self-adjustment, automatic alignment, self-calibration |反义词：misalignment, manual adjustment | 名词
