词源:
The word "shyster" itself is of uncertain origin, but it's likely derived from the Yiddish word "sheyster," meaning "a cheat" or "a swindler."  The "-ism" suffix denotes a practice, system, or doctrine.  Therefore, "shysterism" denotes the practice of engaging in dishonest or unethical behavior, especially of a legal nature.
