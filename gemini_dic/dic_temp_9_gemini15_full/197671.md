USAGE->
This is a proper noun and doesn't have verb conjugations or other grammatical variations in the way a typical verb or adjective would.  The word itself doesn't change grammatically; only its usage in a sentence changes.

PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "Shevchenko" as a core component.  The name might be part of a phrase describing a work by Taras Shevchenko, or referencing the Shevchenko Institute, etc., but those phrases would be context-dependent.  For example:

"Shevchenko's poetry" = 谢甫琴科的诗歌
"The Shevchenko Monument" = 谢甫琴科纪念碑
