词源:

The word "fondling" comes from the Middle English word "fondelen," meaning "to touch gently" or "to caress."  This in turn likely derives from the Old French word "fondre," meaning "to melt" or "to be tender," suggesting a connection to the idea of gentle, melting touch.  The modern English word retains this sense of gentle affection, but has also acquired connotations of sexual touching, especially when used in a negative or inappropriate context.
