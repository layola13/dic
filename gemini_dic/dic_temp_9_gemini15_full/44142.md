The word "criterial" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  If you intended to use a different word, please provide the correct spelling.  If you encountered this word in a specific context, providing that context might help determine its intended meaning.

Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis according to the requested format.
