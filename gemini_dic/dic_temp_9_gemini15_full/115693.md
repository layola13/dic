词源:
The word "marginalities" is derived from the word "marginal," which comes from the Latin word "marginalis," meaning "of or pertaining to a margin."  The suffix "-ities" indicates a plural or a state of being.  Therefore, "marginalities" refers to the multiple conditions or aspects of being marginal or on the fringes of society.
