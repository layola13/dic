词源:  The word "illabile" is derived from the Latin prefix "il-" (meaning "not") and the Latin word "labilis," meaning "liable to slip, fall, or change," related to "labor" (to slip, glide).  Therefore, "illabile" literally means "not liable to slip," but in its modern usage it has evolved to mean the opposite, i.e., "liable to slip or change."
