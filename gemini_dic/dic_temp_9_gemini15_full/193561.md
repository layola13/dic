self-alignment:/ˌsɛlf əˈlaɪnmənt/| n. |自我对齐，自我校准|The process by which a system aligns its internal goals with its external goals, often in the context of artificial intelligence.  This ensures the AI acts in ways consistent with human values and intentions.  It addresses the potential risks of misaligned AI, where the AI's goals diverge from those of its creators. | Example:  Researchers are exploring different methods for self-alignment in advanced AI systems to prevent unintended consequences.  = 研究人员正在探索高级人工智能系统中自我对齐的不同方法，以防止意外后果。|近义词: self-regulation, consistency, conformity |反义词: misalignment, divergence, inconsistency |名词

词源:

The term "self-alignment" is a compound word.  "Self" is an Old English word meaning "own" or "same," while "alignment" comes from the Old French "alignement," ultimately derived from the Latin "ad" (to) + "linea" (line).  Therefore, "self-alignment" literally means the act of bringing something into alignment with itself, or its own intended purpose or values.
