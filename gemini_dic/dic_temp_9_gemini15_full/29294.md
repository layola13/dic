词源:
The word "castable" is derived from the verb "cast," meaning to throw or hurl, but in this context, it refers to the act of shaping molten material by pouring it into a mold.  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or suitability.  The root ultimately traces back to Proto-Germanic *kaustan, meaning "to throw."
