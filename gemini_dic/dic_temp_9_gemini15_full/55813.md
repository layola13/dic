词源:
The word "divestiture" comes from the Latin word "divestire," meaning "to undress" or "to strip."  The prefix "di-" means "away" or "apart," and "vestire" is related to "vestis," meaning "clothing" or "garment."  Over time, the meaning shifted from the literal act of removing clothing to the more figurative sense of relinquishing or giving up something.
