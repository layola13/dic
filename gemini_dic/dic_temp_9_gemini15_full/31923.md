The word "chegoe" is not a word in standard English.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information according to the requested format.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a word from another language:**  If it's from another language, please specify the language so I can attempt a translation and explanation.
* **It's a newly coined word or slang:**  If it's a very recent invention, it might not yet be in standard dictionaries.

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you'd like assistance.
