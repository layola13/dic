词源:
The word "politicise" (or "politicize") comes from the noun "politics," ultimately derived from the Greek word "politikos," meaning "of or relating to citizens" or "political."  The suffix "-ise" /-ize" is a verb-forming suffix indicating "to make or become." Therefore, "politicise" means "to make something political."
