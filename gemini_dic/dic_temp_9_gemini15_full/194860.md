semi-classical:/ˈsɛmiˈklæsɪkəl/ | adj. | 半经典的；介于经典和现代之间的 |  Describes something that blends elements of classical methods or theories with modern or more recent approaches. It often implies an incomplete or transitional state between a purely classical and a fully modern system or approach.  | Example:  The physicist developed a semi-classical model of the atom, combining classical mechanics with quantum theory.  物理学家开发了一个半经典的原子模型，将经典力学与量子理论结合起来。  | 近义词：hybrid, transitional, partly classical | 反义词：purely classical, purely modern |  形容词

词源:
The word "semi-classical" is a compound word formed from "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partly") and "classical" (referring to established, traditional, or canonical methods or theories).  Its meaning arises from the combination of these two elements, indicating a blend of traditional and modern approaches.
