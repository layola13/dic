The word "nonc" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you intended another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* **It's slang or jargon:** It might be used within a specific community or context.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered the word), I might be able to help.
* **It's a newly coined word:**  New words are created all the time.  However, without more information, it's impossible to analyze its meaning and usage.


Please provide more information so I can assist you.
