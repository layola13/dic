词源:

The word "centredness" is derived from the word "centre" (or "center" in American English), which ultimately originates from the Old French word "centre," and before that, from the Latin word "centrum," meaning "centre point."  The suffix "-edness" is a common English suffix that forms nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.  Therefore, "centredness" literally means "the state or quality of being centred."
