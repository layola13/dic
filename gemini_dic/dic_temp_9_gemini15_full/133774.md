The word "nongelatinousness" is a relatively uncommon word, formed by adding the negative prefix "non-" to the noun "gelatinousness."

**Word Origin:**

* **gelatin:** From French *gelée*, past participle of *geler* "to freeze," from Late Latin *gelāre*. Ultimately related to Latin *gelu* "frost, ice."
* **-ous:**  Suffix forming adjectives meaning "full of," "having the quality of," or "characterized by."
* **-ness:** Suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.
* **non-:**  Prefix meaning "not."


**Usage:**

This word describes a lack of gelatinous properties.  Gelatinous substances are jelly-like, viscous, and often transparent.  Therefore, "nongelatinousness" refers to a substance that is not jelly-like, not viscous, and not having a jelly-like consistency.

Because it's a relatively uncommon word, there are limited examples readily available in standard corpora.  Its usage would primarily be found in scientific or technical contexts discussing the physical properties of materials.
