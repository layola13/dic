词源:

The word "canopy" ultimately derives from the Medieval Latin word *canopium*, which itself comes from the Greek word κωνωπεῖον (kōnōpeîon), meaning "mosquito net".  This reflects the original use of canopies as protective coverings, similar to mosquito nets.  The Greek word is derived from κώνωψ (kōnōps), meaning "gnat" or "mosquito".
