The word "lefter" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps it's meant to be "left-er,"  a comparative form implying "more to the left."  However, even this is unusual and grammatically questionable in most contexts.

2. **A neologism or slang:**  It could be a newly coined word, a regional dialect word, or slang used within a specific community.  Without more context, its meaning is impossible to determine.

3. **A typo:** A simple typing error.


Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following your requested format. To do so, I would need a valid English word.  If you can provide the correct spelling or more context about where you encountered this word, I can offer a more accurate analysis.
