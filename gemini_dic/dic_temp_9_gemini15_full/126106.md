mutationist: /mjuːˈteɪʃənɪst/ | n. |突变论者；突变主义者 | A mutationist is a biologist who believes that evolution is primarily driven by mutations, rather than by natural selection.  Mutationists often emphasize the role of large-scale genetic changes in driving evolutionary change. | Example:  Early 20th-century mutationists challenged Darwin's theory of gradual evolution through natural selection.  早期20世纪的突变论者挑战了达尔文关于通过自然选择进行渐进进化的理论。 |近义词:  evolutionary biologist (if focusing on the biological aspect) |反义词: selectionist (emphasizing natural selection)
