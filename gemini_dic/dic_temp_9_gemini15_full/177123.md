词源:
The word "reapprehension" comes from the prefix "re-" (again) and the noun "apprehension," which itself comes from the Latin word "apprehendere," meaning "to seize" or "to grasp."  Thus, the original meaning refers to seizing again.  Over time, the word evolved to also include the sense of anxiety or fear, reflecting the feeling one might have upon being seized or the anticipation of a negative event.
