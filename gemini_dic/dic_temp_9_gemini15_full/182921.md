词源:

The word "repetitiousnesses" is derived from the adjective "repetitious," which itself comes from the verb "repeat."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality. The addition of "-es" denotes a plural form, though it refers to multiple instances of the quality of repetitiveness rather than separate acts of repetition.  Therefore, the etymology traces back to Latin "repetere" (to repeat), through Old French and Middle English.
