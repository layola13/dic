The word "refar" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word, or a word with a similar meaning.  Could you double-check the spelling or provide more context?
* **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, a technical term, or slang used within a specific community.  If this is the case, providing the context where you encountered the word would be helpful.
* **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted in English.  Again, context would be helpful.
