jesuses:/ˈdʒiːzəsɪz/| n.|耶稣们，耶稣的复数形式|The word "jesuses" is the plural form of "Jesus,"  the name of Jesus Christ.  It is rarely used and considered grammatically incorrect by many, as "Jesuses" sounds unnatural and awkward.  A more appropriate plural would be "people named Jesus" or simply "Jesuses" in a context where multiple individuals named Jesus are clearly implied. |例句：While grammatically possible,  using "There were three Jesuses in the room" is stylistically awkward.  It's better to say "There were three men named Jesus in the room." |近义词: people named Jesus, several Jesuses (awkward)|反义词:N/A
