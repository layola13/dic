词源:

The word is a compound word.  "Pro-" is a prefix meaning "in favor of" or "supporting," derived from Latin "pro" meaning "for" or "in front of." "Austrian" is derived from "Austria," ultimately from the Old High German "Ostarrichi," meaning "eastern realm."  Therefore, "pro-Austrian" literally means "in favor of Austria" or "supporting Austria."
