residuals:/rɪˈzɪdʒuəlz/ | n. | 残差；剩余物；剩余部分 | The residuals are the differences between the observed values and the values predicted by a model.  残差是观测值与模型预测值之间的差异。|  The factory had to deal with the residuals from the manufacturing process. 工厂不得不处理制造过程中的残留物。 | remnants, remainders, leftovers |  nothing (in the sense of what's left) | 名词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The model explains most of the data, but some residuals remain. = 模型解释了大部分数据，但仍有一些残差。
There are always residuals in any statistical analysis. = 任何统计分析中总会有残差。


一般过去时:
The residuals from the previous experiment were analyzed. = 对先前实验的残差进行了分析。
Large residuals indicated a problem with the data collection. = 大的残差表明数据收集存在问题。


现在完成时:
Scientists have carefully examined the residuals from the reaction. = 科学家们仔细检查了反应后的残留物。
We have found that the residuals are normally distributed. = 我们发现残差服从正态分布。


过去完成时:
Before the final analysis, the researchers had removed the outliers and recalculated the residuals. = 在最终分析之前，研究人员去除了异常值并重新计算了残差。
The team had already identified several sources of error that contributed to the large residuals.  = 该团队已经确定了导致较大残差的几个误差来源。


将来时:
Researchers will analyze the residuals to refine the model. = 研究人员将分析残差以改进模型。
We will examine the residuals to check for any patterns. = 我们将检查残差以查找任何模式。


虚拟语气:
If the residuals were smaller, the model would be more accurate. = 如果残差更小，模型将更准确。
It is important to note that if the residuals are not randomly distributed, the model may be misspecified. = 重要的是要注意，如果残差不是随机分布的，则模型可能指定错误。


被动语态:
The residuals were plotted against the predicted values. = 残差相对于预测值作图。
The residuals are often used to assess the goodness of fit of a statistical model. = 残差常用于评估统计模型的拟合优度。


疑问句:
What are the residuals telling us about the model? = 残差告诉我们关于模型的什么信息？
Are the residuals normally distributed? = 残差是否服从正态分布？


否定句:
The residuals do not show any obvious patterns. = 残差没有显示任何明显的模式。
The model does not account for all the variation, as evidenced by the remaining residuals. = 模型并未解释所有变异，残留的残差证明了这一点。
