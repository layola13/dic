inexpiably:/ɪnˈɛkspɪəbli/| adj. | 不可解释地，无法解释地 | Incapable of being explained or accounted for; inexplicably.  The adjective "inexpiably" describes something that cannot be explained or justified. It suggests a deep mystery or a profound lack of understanding. | The crime remained inexplicably unsolved. 犯罪案件无法解释地没有破获。

The origins of the word are as follows:

* **in-:**  A prefix meaning "not" or "without."
* **expiable:**  From Latin "expiabilis," meaning "capable of being atoned for" or "capable of being explained."  This root relates to the concept of "expiation," which is the act of making amends or atoning for wrongdoing.  The "expiable" portion implies that something can be explained or justified, often through some form of atonement or clarification.

Therefore, "inexpiably" means "not capable of being explained or atoned for."  It emphasizes the irremovability of the mystery or the inability to find a satisfactory explanation.
