The word "rited" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a very rare, archaic, or dialectal word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  To assist you, I need a correctly spelled word.  If you can provide the intended word, I will gladly provide the analysis as requested.
