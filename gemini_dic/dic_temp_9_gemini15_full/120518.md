词源:

The word "minutiae" comes from the Latin word "minutia," the diminutive of "minutus," meaning "small" or "minute."  It entered English in the 17th century.


用法说明:

Minutiae is always used as a plural noun. It refers to small, often insignificant details that, while individually unimportant, can collectively contribute to a larger understanding or picture.  It often implies a large number of such details.  The word carries a connotation of careful attention to detail, but also sometimes suggests an overwhelming or excessive focus on insignificant aspects.
