英文解析：The word "hypertense" combines the prefix "hyper-" (meaning "excessive" or "above") with "tense" (meaning strained or anxious).  It describes a state of extreme tension, often accompanied by anxiety or nervousness.  The person experiencing hypertensity is likely on edge, easily agitated, and possibly exhibiting physical symptoms of stress.


例句：

词源:

* **hyper-**: From Greek ὑπέρ (hupér), meaning "over," "above," "beyond."
* **tense**: From Old French *tens, from Latin *tensus, past participle of *tendere, "to stretch."


用法说明:  "Hypertense" is primarily used as an adjective to describe a person, situation, or atmosphere.  It emphasizes the extreme nature of the tension involved.  It's less frequently used than "tense" because it suggests a heightened, almost unbearable level of stress.
