词源:

The word "interactivities" is derived from the word "interactive," which itself is a combination of the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and the word "active."  Therefore, "interactivities" refers to the various ways in which things or people interact with each other. The "-ities" suffix transforms the adjective "interactive" into a noun, signifying the qualities or characteristics of being interactive.
