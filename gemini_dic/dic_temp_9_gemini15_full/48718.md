词源:  From the verb "defy," which comes from the Old French "defier" meaning "to challenge, to forbid."  This in turn has roots in the Latin "dis-" (away, apart) and "fidere" (to trust), suggesting an original meaning of "to distrust" or "to mistrust," evolving into a sense of open challenge or resistance.
