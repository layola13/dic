USAGE->

This word is so rare that providing examples across various tenses and grammatical structures is impractical and would be misleading. The usage is almost exclusively limited to academic or highly specialized contexts.  Therefore, tense examples are omitted.

PHRASE->

Because "equatabilities" is a rarely used word, providing common phrases is not applicable.
