词源:
The word "fainty" is derived from the adjective "faint," ultimately from the Old French "faindre" meaning "to feign, dissemble, pretend," and earlier from the Latin "fingere" with the same meaning. While the modern meaning of "faint" is not directly related to pretending, the original sense of weakness or feebleness might have contributed to the evolution of its current meaning.  The "-y" suffix adds an adjectival quality, indicating a state or condition.  Therefore, "fainty" describes something that is characterized by faintness or weakness.
