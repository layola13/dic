PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "mussulmanic".  The word itself is archaic and should be avoided.  Instead, use "Muslim" or "Islamic" in any phrasing.  For example:

Muslim community = 穆斯林社群
Islamic law = 伊斯兰法
Islamic art = 伊斯兰艺术
Muslim world = 穆斯林世界
Islamic studies = 伊斯兰研究


词源:
The word "mussulmanic" is derived from "Mussulman," an older, now largely obsolete term for a Muslim.  "Mussulman" itself comes from the Arabic word "muslim," meaning "one who submits (to God)."  The suffix "-ic" is added to create an adjectival form.  The term carries a history of colonial usage and has negative connotations for many.

注意事项:  The word "mussulmanic" is strongly discouraged due to its outdated and potentially offensive nature.  Use "Muslim" or "Islamic" instead.
