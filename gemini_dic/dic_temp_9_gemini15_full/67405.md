externalistic:/ˌɛkˌstɜːrnəlˈɪstɪk/ | adj. | 外在的；外部主义的 | Relating to or characteristic of externalism, a philosophical position that emphasizes external factors in determining meaning, truth, or knowledge.  It contrasts with internalism, which focuses on internal mental states.  For example, in semantics, an externalist view might hold that the meaning of a word is determined by its use in a community, rather than solely by an individual's understanding. | Example:  The speaker presented an externalistic theory of meaning, arguing that reference depends on social factors.  = 演讲者提出了一种外部主义的意义理论，认为指称依赖于社会因素。


The judge's decision was based on externalistic evidence, not just the defendant's testimony. = 法官的判决是基于外部证据，而不仅仅是被告的证词。| 近义词：extrinsic, outward, objective | 反义词：internalistic, intrinsic, subjective


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in philosophical discussions and academic writing, particularly in the fields of philosophy of mind, epistemology, and semantics. Therefore, providing typical grammatical examples in different tenses like the example word "what" is not applicable.  Instead, I will provide examples illustrating its usage in different contexts within philosophical discussions.

Example sentences demonstrating usage in different philosophical contexts:

Epistemology:
An externalistic theory of justification claims that the reliability of a belief depends on its causal origins, rather than solely on the believer's internal mental states. = 一种外部主义的合理性理论认为，信念的可靠性取决于其因果起源，而不是仅仅取决于相信者的内部心理状态。

Externalistic accounts of knowledge often appeal to the social and environmental factors that contribute to the acquisition of true beliefs. = 关于知识的外部主义解释通常诉诸于有助于获得真信念的社会和环境因素。

Semantics:
Externalistic semantics, unlike internalistic semantics, focus on the relationship between words and the external world, rather than on the mental representations of speakers. = 外部主义语义学与内部主义语义学不同，它关注词语与外部世界之间的关系，而不是说话者的心理表征。

Externalistic theories of reference claim that the reference of a term is fixed by its causal history, not by the speaker's intentions. = 关于指称的外部主义理论认为，术语的指称是由其因果历史决定的，而不是由说话者的意图决定的.

Philosophy of Mind:
Externalistic theories of mental content argue that the content of our thoughts is determined by the environment and our interactions with it, not solely by our internal mental states.  = 关于心理内容的外部主义理论认为，我们思想的内容是由环境以及我们与环境的互动决定的，而不仅仅是由我们的内部心理状态决定的。
