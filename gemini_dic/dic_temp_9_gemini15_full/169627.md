词源:  From Middle English *propiciacioun, from Old French *propiciacion, from Latin propitiatio, from propitiare "to appease, conciliate," from propitius "favorable, gracious."  The Latin root ultimately relates to PIE *pro- "forward" + *pe- "to feed, nourish," suggesting the idea of "feeding forward" to gain favor.
