词源:
The word "skeleton" comes from the late Middle English word "skeletone," which is derived from the Late Latin word "scheleton," ultimately from the Greek word "skeletos," meaning "dried up," "mummified," or "body."  The Greek word highlights the skeletal remains' appearance after the flesh has decayed.
