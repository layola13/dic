The word "emboitement" is a French word. It is derived from the verb "boîter," meaning "to box" or "to fit into a box,"  with the prefix "en-" indicating "in" or "into."  Therefore,  "emboitement" literally means "the act of boxing in" or "fitting into one another."  It's a relatively uncommon word even in French, primarily used in technical contexts.
