词源:
The word "damnedest" is a superlative form of "damned," which itself is a euphemism for "condemned" (to hell).  The addition of "-est" creates a superlative, implying the highest degree or most extreme example.  The original meaning is related to religious condemnation, but in modern usage, it's primarily an intensifier.
