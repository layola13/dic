英文解析:The word "deritualized" describes something that has lost its ritualistic or ceremonial aspects.  It suggests a simplification or removal of traditional formalities and observances associated with a particular event, practice, or belief system.  This can be due to changes in societal norms, intentional simplification, or a conscious rejection of tradition.

例句:

词源:

The word is formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove or deprive of") to the word "ritualized," which itself is derived from "ritual" ("a religious or solemn ceremony or act") and the suffix "-ized" (meaning "to make or become").  Therefore, "deritualized" literally means "deprived of ritual."
