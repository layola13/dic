plathelminthes:/ˌplætəlˈmɪnθiːz/| n. |扁形动物门|Platyhelminthes is a phylum of relatively simple invertebrates, characterized by their flat, bilaterally symmetrical bodies. They are acoelomate, meaning they lack a body cavity.  They include free-living forms like planarians, and parasitic forms like flukes and tapeworms.  They are known for their simple nervous systems and varied reproductive strategies.  | Example:  The study focused on the regenerative capabilities of certain species within the phylum Platyhelminthes.  这项研究集中在扁形动物门某些物种的再生能力上。
