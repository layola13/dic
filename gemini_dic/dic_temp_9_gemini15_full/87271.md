Hermaphrodism is a natural occurrence in many plant and animal species.  |例句：Some species of snails exhibit hermaphrodism, meaning each individual possesses both male and female reproductive organs.  一些蜗牛物种表现出雌雄同体现象，这意味着每个个体都拥有雄性和雌性生殖器官。

例句：The study of hermaphrodism in plants helps us understand the evolution of reproductive strategies.  对植物雌雄同体现象的研究帮助我们理解生殖策略的进化。

近义词：intersexuality, androgyny |反义词：unisexuality, gonochorism
