词源:  The word "prefurnishing" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the noun "furnishing" (the act of providing furniture and other necessary items to a room or building).  It's a relatively modern word, formed through the natural process of combining existing elements to create a new word to describe a specific action or concept.
