linear:/ˈlɪniər/ | adj. |线性的，直线的，线状的 | Relating to or resembling a line; straight.  Characterized by a relationship between two variables where a change in one is directly proportional to a change in the other. |例句：The relationship between distance and time is linear in uniform motion.  匀速运动中，距离和时间的关系是线性的。


例句：The graph shows a linear relationship between temperature and pressure.  该图表显示了温度和压力之间的线性关系。


近义词：straight, rectilinear, aligned | 反义词：nonlinear, curved, curvilinear


词源:  From Latin *linearis, from linea "line".  The word ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *lein-, meaning "to bend, to flex," which seems counterintuitive given the word's modern meaning. However, the original meaning likely referred to a perfectly straight, unbent line.


用法说明:

linear function 线性函数
A linear function is a function whose graph is a straight line.  It can be represented in the form y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept.


例句:The formula for calculating simple interest is a linear function. 计算单利息的公式是一个线性函数。


例句:The speed of a car traveling at a constant velocity is a linear function of time. 以恒定速度行驶的汽车的速度是时间的线性函数。



linear algebra 线性代数
Linear algebra is the branch of mathematics concerning vector spaces and linear mappings between such spaces.

例句：Linear algebra is essential for understanding many areas of physics and engineering. 线性代数对于理解物理学和工程学的许多领域至关重要。


例句：Matrix operations are a fundamental concept in linear algebra. 矩阵运算是线性代数中的一个基本概念。


linear programming 线性规划
Linear programming is a mathematical method used to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships.

例句：Linear programming is used to optimize resource allocation in many industries. 线性规划用于优化许多行业的资源分配。


例句：Many real-world problems can be modeled using linear programming techniques. 许多现实世界的问题可以使用线性规划技术进行建模。


linear equation 线性方程
A linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and a single variable.

例句：Solving a system of linear equations is a common task in mathematics. 求解线性方程组是数学中的一项常见任务。


例句：A linear equation can be represented graphically as a straight line. 线性方程可以用图形表示为一条直线。
