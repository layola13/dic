词源:  The word "drabness" derives from the adjective "drab," which, in its earliest usage, referred to a dull brownish-grey colour.  The origin of "drab" itself is uncertain, but it's possibly related to an obsolete word meaning "mud" or "mire."  The sense of dullness and monotony extended from the color to describe a general lack of vibrancy or interest.
