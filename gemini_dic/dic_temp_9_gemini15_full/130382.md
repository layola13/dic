词源:  The word "non-valuable" is a compound word. "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "valuable" is an adjective derived from the noun "value," ultimately from Old French *valoir ("to be worth").  The concept of value itself has roots in Latin *valēre ("to be strong, be well").  Thus, "non-valuable" literally means "not having worth or strength."
