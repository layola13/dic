词源:  The word "cornified" is derived from the word "corn," meaning "horn,"  which in turn comes from the Old English word "horn."  The suffix "-ified" indicates the process of becoming something. Therefore, "cornified" literally means "having become horn-like."  The connection to "horn" is related to the hard, keratinous nature of horns and the similar properties of cornified cells.
