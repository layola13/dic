We have observed that the substance has always been nongaseous at room temperature. = 我们观察到该物质在室温下一直是非气态的。


过去完成时:
The reaction had produced a nongaseous byproduct before the observation. = 在观察之前，反应已经产生了一种非气态的副产物。
The researchers had determined that the substance was nongaseous in its original state. = 研究人员已经确定该物质在其原始状态下是非气态的。


将来时:
The substance will remain nongaseous unless heated to a high temperature. = 除非加热到高温，否则该物质将保持非气态。
The experiment will show that the compound is nongaseous at low pressures. = 实验将表明该化合物在低压下是非气态的。


虚拟语气:
If the substance were nongaseous, the reaction would proceed differently. = 如果该物质是非气态的，反应过程将不同。

疑问句:
Is the substance in question nongaseous at room temperature? = 该物质在室温下是否是非气态的？
Are all the reactants nongaseous in this chemical reaction? = 在这个化学反应中，所有反应物都是非气态的吗？


否定句:
The gas was not nongaseous; it was in a gaseous state. = 该气体并非非气态；它处于气态。
The products of the reaction were not all nongaseous. = 该反应的产物并非全是气态的。


PHRASE->
nongaseous phase = 非气态相
nongaseous component = 非气态组分
nongaseous substance = 非气态物质
nongaseous matter = 非气态物质
nongaseous state = 非气态状态

词源:
The word is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "gaseous" (referring to a gas).  "Gaseous" itself derives from "gas," which has a complex etymology ultimately related to the chaotic nature of gases.
