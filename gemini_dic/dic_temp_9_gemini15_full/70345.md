词源:
The word "fiend" ultimately derives from the Old English word "fēond," meaning "enemy," "foe," or "devil."  This word itself has Germanic roots, related to words meaning "hate" or "hostility." Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass not only literal evil spirits but also individuals with an intense passion or obsession, often to an extreme degree.  The modern usage reflects this dual meaning—someone passionately devoted to something or someone wicked and malicious.
