overengineer:/ˌoʊvərˌɛndʒɪˈnɪr/ | vt. |过度设计；设计过度 | To design or build something with more complexity or features than are necessary or desirable.  This often leads to increased cost, complexity, and reduced efficiency.  | 例句：They overengineered the simple device, making it expensive and difficult to maintain.  他们过度设计了这个简单的装置，使其变得昂贵且难以维护。

They overengineered the solution, adding unnecessary features that slowed down the system. 他们过度设计了方案，添加了不必要的特性，导致系统运行缓慢。


近义词：overcomplicate, overbuild, overdesign | 反义词：simplify, streamline

将来时:
They will overengineer the next iteration of the product. = 他们将在产品的下一次迭代中过度设计。
We will likely overengineer the project unless we carefully plan it. = 除非我们仔细计划，否则我们很可能会过度设计这个项目。


虚拟语气:
If they hadn't overengineered the system, it would be more efficient. = 如果他们没有过度设计系统，它会更高效。

疑问句:
Was the software overengineered? = 软件是否被过度设计了？
Did they overengineer the solution? = 他们是否过度设计了方案？


否定句:
They didn't overengineer the design; it's simple and effective. = 他们没有过度设计这个设计；它简单有效。
We didn't overengineer the process; it's streamlined and efficient. = 我们没有过度设计这个流程；它简化且高效。
