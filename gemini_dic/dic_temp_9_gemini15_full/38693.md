词源:
The word "condenser" comes from the verb "condense," meaning "to make more compact or dense," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "condensare," which is a combination of "con-" (together) and "densare" (to thicken).  The application to both refrigeration and electronics reflects the core meaning of bringing something together or making it more compact.
