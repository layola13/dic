词源:
From Late Latin *capitulat-, from Latin capitulare "to arrange in chapters," from capitulum "chapter," diminutive of caput "head."  The original meaning referred to the surrender of terms of a treaty, which were often arranged in chapters or sections.  The sense evolved to encompass the surrender itself.
