/ɪntərˈwɪʃt/ | adj. | 互相祝愿的，彼此祝愿的 |  The word "interwished" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word. It's likely formed by combining "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and "wished" (past tense of "wish").  It suggests a reciprocal exchange of wishes.  There is no established meaning or usage in dictionaries or standard English corpora.  Therefore, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage is not possible.  The meaning would depend entirely on the context in which it is used.  |  No example sentences can be provided as the word is not established. | No synonyms or antonyms exist. | adj.
