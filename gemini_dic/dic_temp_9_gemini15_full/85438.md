hash's: /hæʃɪz/ | n. | 哈希值(复数) | The plural form of "hash," referring to multiple hash values or instances of hashing.  It often appears in contexts related to cryptography, data structures, or computer science. | Example: The system generates multiple hashes' for each file to ensure data integrity.  这个系统为每个文件生成多个哈希值以确保数据完整性。 |近义词: checksums (if referring to data integrity)|反义词: (no direct antonym)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The program generates many hashes. = 程序生成许多哈希值。
These hashes represent the data. = 这些哈希值代表数据。

一般过去时:
The server calculated the hashes. = 服务器计算了哈希值。
We compared the hashes for differences. = 我们比较了哈希值的差异。


现在完成时:
The system has produced several hashes. = 系统已经生成了几个哈希值。
They have checked all the hashes. = 他们已经检查了所有哈希值。


过去完成时:
The program had already computed the hashes. = 程序已经计算好了哈希值。
We had compared the hashes before the report. = 我们在报告之前已经比较了哈希值。


将来时:
The algorithm will generate new hashes. = 该算法将生成新的哈希值。
We will check the hashes tomorrow. = 我们明天将检查哈希值。


虚拟语气:
If the hashes matched, we would proceed. = 如果哈希值匹配，我们将继续进行。
I wish the hashes were consistent. = 我希望哈希值一致。


被动语态:
The hashes were checked automatically. = 哈希值被自动检查。
The hashes are being compared now. = 哈希值正在被比较。


疑问句:
Are these the correct hashes? = 这些是正确的哈希值吗？
How many hashes were generated? = 生成了多少个哈希值？


否定句:
The hashes did not match. = 哈希值不匹配。
The system did not produce the expected hashes. = 系统没有生成预期的哈希值。


PHRASE->
hash function: 哈希函数
hash table: 哈希表
hash algorithm: 哈希算法
collision resistant hash: 抗碰撞哈希
cryptographic hash: 密码哈希
