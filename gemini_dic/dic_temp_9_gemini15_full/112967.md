词源:

The word "lukewarm" is a compound word. It originates from the Old English word "hlūc," meaning "warm," and the Old English suffix "-wærm," meaning "warm."  The "hlūc" part evolved through Middle English "luke" to the modern "luke." Thus,  "lukewarm" literally means "moderately warm."  It later extended its meaning to include figurative senses of lacking enthusiasm or passion.
