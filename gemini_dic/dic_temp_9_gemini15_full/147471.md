词源:

* **over-**:  Prefix meaning "too much," "excessively," or "above."
* **opinionated**: Adjective meaning "having strong opinions; stubborn."  This word itself comes from "opinion" + "-ated" (a suffix forming adjectives).

Therefore, "overopinionated" combines the prefix "over-" with the adjective "opinionated" to create a word describing someone who holds opinions to an excessive degree.
