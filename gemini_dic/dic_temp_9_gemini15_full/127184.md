英文解析：Naturalness refers to the quality or state of being natural,  unartificial, or spontaneous. It can describe something that exists in nature without human intervention, or it can refer to a person's natural ability or behavior.  The word is formed by adding the possessive 's' to "naturalness," indicating possession or belonging.  However,  grammatically, this is unusual and might be considered an error.  It's more common and grammatically correct to use phrasing like "the naturalness of something" or "its naturalness."
