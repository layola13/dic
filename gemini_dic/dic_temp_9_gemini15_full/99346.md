interdefinability: /ˌɪntərˌdɪfaɪnəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 相互定义性 | The property or state of being mutually definable; the ability of two or more concepts to be defined in terms of each other.  This often arises in systems where the meaning of one concept depends on the understanding of another, and vice-versa, creating a circular but ultimately coherent definition. | The interdefinability of 'left' and 'right' is apparent; you can't define one without implicitly defining the other.  | 近义词：mutual dependence, reciprocal definition | 反义词：independence, separate definition | 名词


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in philosophical and logical discussions, particularly within the context of:

* **Formal systems:**  Interdefinability is crucial in examining the consistency and completeness of axiomatic systems.  If two terms are interdefinable, their definitions can be substituted for each other without changing the meaning of the system.
* **Ontology:**  The study of being explores the relationships between concepts, and interdefinability plays a role in understanding how concepts are related and defined.
* **Semantics:**  The study of meaning often examines how words and concepts relate to each other, and interdefinability is a key aspect of semantic relationships.
* **Mathematics:** In certain mathematical structures, concepts may be interdefinable, allowing for alternative definitions and approaches to problem-solving.


Example Sentences (Illustrative, as specific examples require contextual understanding):

1.  The high degree of interdefinability between "justice" and "fairness" makes it difficult to define either term independently. =  正义与公平之间高度的相互定义性使得难以独立定义任一术语。

2. The apparent interdefinability of 'cause' and 'effect' in some philosophical systems has led to ongoing debate about causality. = 在一些哲学体系中，“因”与“果”的表面相互定义性导致了关于因果关系的持续争论。

4. **Self-referential:** Although not strictly synonymous, self-referential systems often exhibit aspects of interdefinability.
5. **Defined in terms of:** This phrase directly describes the mechanism by which interdefinability operates.
