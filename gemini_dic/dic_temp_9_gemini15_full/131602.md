词源:  The word is formed by the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "complacent," which comes from the Old French word "complaisant," meaning "pleasing," derived from the Latin "complacēre," meaning "to please."  Therefore, "noncomplacent" literally means "not pleasing oneself" or "not self-satisfied."
