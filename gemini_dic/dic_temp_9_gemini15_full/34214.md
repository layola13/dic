词源:  The word "clanger" originates from the onomatopoeic word "clang," meaning a loud, resonant metallic sound.  The sense of a "serious mistake" developed from the idea of something going wrong with a loud, noticeable noise.  Think of a dropped pot or a badly played musical note.  The clanging sound became associated with the obviousness and impact of the error.
