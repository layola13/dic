词源:
The idiom "face the music" originates from the 19th century.  Its original meaning was related to military formations.  Soldiers would "face the music" literally, meaning to stand and wait for an inspection or review which might have involved musical accompaniment. This gradually evolved to its current figurative meaning of confronting the unpleasant consequences of one's actions. The "music" in this context represents the criticism, punishment, or disapproval one must endure.
