词源:
The word "jazz" has an uncertain etymology, with several competing theories.  One popular theory links it to a slang term used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, possibly derived from African American Vernacular English.  Other suggestions include connections to words meaning "energy," "spirit," or "sexual excitement," reflecting the vibrant and improvisational nature of the music.  The exact origin remains debated.
