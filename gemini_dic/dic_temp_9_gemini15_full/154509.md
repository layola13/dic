词源:
The word "perpetrate" comes from the Late Latin word "perpetratus," the past participle of "perpetrare," meaning "to accomplish," "to complete," or "to carry through."  This in turn is from "per-" (through, thoroughly) and "petrare" (to go through, accomplish).  The original meaning is neutral, but over time, its usage shifted primarily to negative actions.
