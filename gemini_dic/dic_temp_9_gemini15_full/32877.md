chondrification:/ˌkɒndrɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/| n. |软骨化；成软骨|The process by which cartilage is formed.  This can refer to the development of cartilage in the embryo or the replacement of other tissues with cartilage.|Example:  Chondrification of the skeleton begins early in embryonic development.  软骨骨骼的形成始于胚胎发育早期。|近义词：cartilaginification|反义词：ossification (bone formation)
