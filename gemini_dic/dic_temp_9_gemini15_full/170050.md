词源:
The word "proteolytic" is derived from "proteolysis," which in turn comes from "protein" (from Greek *prōteios*, meaning "primary" or "of first importance") and the suffix "-lysis" (from Greek *lýsis*, meaning "loosening," "dissolution," or "separation").  Therefore, "proteolytic" literally means "relating to the breaking down of proteins."
