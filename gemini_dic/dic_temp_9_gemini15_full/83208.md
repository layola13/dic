词源:
The word "guzzler" is derived from the verb "guzzle," which means to drink greedily or rapidly.  "Guzzle" itself likely originated from an imitative word, reflecting the sound of drinking noisily.  The "-er" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, indicating someone or something that performs the action of guzzling.
