词源:

The word "indelicate" is derived from the Old French word "indelicat," which itself comes from the Latin prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the Late Latin word "delicatus," meaning "delicate," "refined," or "dainty." The evolution reflects a simple negation of the positive qualities of "delicate."
