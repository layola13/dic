词源:  The word derives from the Late Latin word *eleemosyna*, which itself comes from the Greek word ἐλεημοσύνη (*eleēmosynē*), meaning "alms," "charity," or "mercy."  This Greek term is composed of ἐλεειν (*eleein*), meaning "to pity" or "to have mercy," and μοσύνη (*mosynē*),  a suffix indicating "act" or "custom."  Thus, the word's roots point to the act of showing pity or mercy through charitable giving.
