词源:

The word "disparageable" is derived from the verb "disparage," which comes from the Old French word "desparagier," meaning "to make unequal, to lower in rank or value."  The prefix "dis-" adds a negative or contrary sense, while "-able" indicates capability or possibility.  Therefore, "disparageable" means capable of being lowered in rank or value, or of being treated with contempt.
