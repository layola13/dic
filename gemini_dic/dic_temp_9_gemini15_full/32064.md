Etymology:  The word "cherubic" is derived from the word "cherub," which originates from the Hebrew word כרוב (kerub), meaning "one who intercedes," or "one who praises."  In the Hebrew Bible, cherubim are celestial beings, often depicted as winged creatures with human-like faces, guarding sacred places.  The Christian tradition adopted this imagery, often portraying cherubim as beautiful, innocent children.  The adjective "cherubic" thus evolved to describe the appealing qualities associated with these depictions.
