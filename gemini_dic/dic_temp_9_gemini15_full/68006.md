factive:/ˈfæktɪv/| adj.| 事实的；陈述事实的 |  A factive verb is one that presupposes the truth of its complement clause.  In other words, if you use a factive verb, you're implying that what you're saying in the complement clause is true.  | Example:  He regretted that he had lied. (The fact that he lied is presupposed.)  | 近义词：truthful, veridical | 反义词：non-factive


例句：

He admitted that he was wrong.  (他承认自己错了。)


She realized that she had made a mistake. (她意识到自己犯了一个错误。)


词源:

The word "factive" is derived from the Latin word "factum," meaning "fact" or "deed."  The suffix "-ive" indicates an adjective, meaning "having the nature of."


用法说明:

Factive verbs are used to express a state of affairs where the speaker believes the complement clause to be true.  The truth of the complement is not something that is being debated or questioned; it is presented as a given.  Common factive verbs include:

* regret (后悔)
* realize (意识到)
* admit (承认)
* discover (发现)
* know (知道)
* be aware (意识到)
* be glad (高兴)
* be sorry (抱歉)
* be certain (确信)


Non-factive verbs, in contrast, do not presuppose the truth of their complement clause. Examples include:

* believe (相信)
* think (认为)
* suppose (假设)
* say (说)
* suggest (建议)


The difference is crucial in semantics and pragmatics because factive verbs carry a stronger implication of truth than non-factive verbs.


Unlike the example provided with "what",  factive verbs are a specific grammatical category and not a question word or phrase.  Therefore, the USAGE section concerning tenses, moods, and sentence types is not applicable to the word "factive" itself.  The word "factive" describes a property of verbs and their clauses, not a grammatical structure that can be conjugated.
