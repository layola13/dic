evolvent:/ˈiːvɒlvənt/| n. |渐开线|A curve generated by the end of a taut string unwinding from a cylinder or other curve.  It is a mathematical curve with applications in gear design and other engineering fields.  The shape is defined by the curve from which the string unwinds. For example, the involute of a circle is a common type in mechanical engineering. |The gear teeth are designed using involutes to ensure smooth and constant transmission of power.  The shape of the cam follower can also be an evolvent. |近义词：involute (often used interchangeably)|反义词：无直接反义词
