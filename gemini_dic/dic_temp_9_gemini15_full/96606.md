inductric:/ɪnˈdʌktrɪk/| adj.|感应的，诱导的| Relating to or caused by induction.  The word is rarely used in modern English and is largely obsolete.  It's primarily found in older scientific texts relating to electromagnetic induction. | Example: The inductric effect of the coil was measured.  感应线圈的感应效应被测量了。|近义词: inductive (more common)|反义词:  None specifically, but words implying a lack of induction (e.g., resistive) could be considered antonyms in specific contexts.|形容词


USAGE->
This word is so rarely used that providing example sentences across various tenses is impractical and misleading.  The grammatical usage would follow standard adjective rules.  For example:

一般现在时:
The inductric current is strong. = 感应电流很强。
The machine shows an inductric effect. = 这台机器显示出感应效应。


一般过去时:
The inductric field was significant. = 感应场很显著。
The experiment demonstrated an inductric phenomenon. = 实验展示了一种感应现象。


现在完成时:
Scientists have observed many inductric processes. = 科学家们已经观察到许多感应过程。
The research has revealed a new inductric property. = 研究揭示了一种新的感应特性。


过去完成时:
They had already measured the inductric force before the experiment concluded. = 他们在实验结束前已经测量了感应力。
The engineers had anticipated the inductric behavior of the system. = 工程师们已经预料到系统的感应行为。


将来时:
The new technology will utilize inductric principles. = 新技术将利用感应原理。
We will investigate the inductric properties of this material. = 我们将研究这种材料的感应特性。



PHRASE->
Because "inductric" is an adjective,  it doesn't form common phrases in the same way verbs or nouns do.  Phrases would involve it modifying a noun,  for example:


inductric field: 感应场
inductric current: 感应电流
inductric effect: 感应效应
inductric coupling: 感应耦合
inductric properties: 感应特性
