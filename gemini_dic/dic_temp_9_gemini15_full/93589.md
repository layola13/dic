词源:
The word "embalm" comes from the Old French word "enbaumer," which is a compound of "en-" (in) and "baumer" (to perfume, to balm).  It ultimately derives from the Greek word "balsamon," meaning "balsam."  The practice of embalming has ancient origins, particularly associated with the Egyptians' use of balsams and resins for preserving bodies.
