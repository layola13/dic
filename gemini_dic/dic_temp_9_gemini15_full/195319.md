/ˈsemiˌlɛnz/| n. |半透镜|A semilens is a type of optical element that partially transmits and partially reflects light.  It's often used in applications where both transmitted and reflected light are needed, unlike a regular lens which primarily focuses or refracts light.  It can be designed to split a light beam into two beams, or to create other specific light manipulation effects.|Example: The laser beam was split into two beams using a semilens, one for measurement and one for processing. |近义词: partial reflector, beam splitter|反义词: full reflector, full lens|名词
