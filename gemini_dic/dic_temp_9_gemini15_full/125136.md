词源:

The word "multi-platinum" is a compound word.  "Multi-" is a prefix meaning "many" or "multiple," derived from Latin "multus" (much, many). "Platinum" refers to the platinum record certification awarded to albums or singles that reach a certain high sales threshold.  The term evolved from the original "platinum record" which denoted a higher sales level than a "gold record". The "multi-" prefix emphasizes the achievement of multiple platinum certifications, indicating exceptionally high sales figures.
