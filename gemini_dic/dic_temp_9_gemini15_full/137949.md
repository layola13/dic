The word "nonweakness" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's a neologism, meaning a newly coined word or expression.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  However, we can analyze it based on its constituent parts:

"non-" : /ˈnɒn/ | prefix | 非，不 |  Negates the following word. | Example: non-profit |  N/A | weakness


"weakness" : /ˈwiːknəs/ | n. | 弱点，缺点 | A fault, failing, or deficiency. | Example: His main weakness is his impatience.  |  shortcoming, flaw, defect | strength, advantage


Therefore, "nonweakness" would logically mean *the absence of weakness* or *strength*, or a *lack of deficiencies*.  However,  it's important to note that its usage is highly unconventional and should be avoided in formal writing or communication unless explicitly defined within a specific context.


Since it's not a real word, I cannot provide the usage examples, phrases, etc. as requested in the template.  If you intended a different word or have a specific context in mind where this word might be used, please provide more details.
