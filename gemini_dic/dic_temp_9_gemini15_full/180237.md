refractometry:/rɪˌfræktˈɒmɪtri/ | n. | 折射测定法 | The measurement of the refractive index of a substance, often used to determine its purity or concentration. Refractometry is a widely used technique in various fields, including chemistry, food science, and medicine, to analyze the composition and properties of liquids and solids.  | Example:  Refractometry was used to determine the sugar concentration in the fruit juice. 折射测定法被用来测定果汁中的糖浓度。


The refractive index of this solution was measured using refractometry.  用折射测定法测量了该溶液的折射率。| 近义词: refractive index measurement,  | 反义词:  (no direct antonym, as it's a measurement technique) | 名词
