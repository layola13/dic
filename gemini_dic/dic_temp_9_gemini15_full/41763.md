WORD ORIGIN->
The word "corruptibilities" is derived from the adjective "corruptible," which in turn comes from the Latin word "corruptus," the past participle of "corrumpere," meaning "to break, destroy, or ruin."  The suffix "-ibilities" indicates a state or capacity.  Therefore, "corruptibilities" refers to the inherent qualities or tendencies towards corruption.
