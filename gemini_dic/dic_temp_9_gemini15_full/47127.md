dauphin:/ˈdɔːfɪn/ | n. | 海豚；王储 | The Dauphin was the heir apparent to the throne of France.  |  近义词：heir apparent, crown prince | 反义词：N/A


英文解析：
Historically, the Dauphin was the title given to the heir apparent to the French throne.  The title originated in the 14th century and was associated with the province of Dauphiné.  Today, the word is also commonly used to refer to a dolphin, a type of marine mammal.  The connection between the two meanings is largely etymological,  with the original meaning having influenced the later, less common usage.


例句：
The historical Dauphin of France held significant power and influence. = 法国的历史上的王储拥有重要的权力和影响力。

He mistook the playful dolphin for a dauphin, a historical figure. = 他把嬉戏的海豚误认为是王储，一个历史人物。



词源:
The word "dauphin" comes from the Old French word "dauphins," which means "dolphin."  This was originally a reference to a type of fish (a dolphin), and the connection to the French royal title arose because the Dauphiné region had a dolphin as its symbol.  The county of Vienne, later the Dauphiné, was given to the heir apparent of the French throne, thus establishing the association.
