homoeomorphism:/ˌhoʊmioʊˈmɔːrfɪzəm/| n. |同胚|A homeomorphism is a continuous bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between two topological spaces whose inverse is also continuous.  In simpler terms, it's a mapping between two spaces that preserves their topological properties, such as connectedness, compactness, and the number of holes.  Two spaces that can be related by a homeomorphism are said to be homeomorphic.  They are essentially the same from a topological perspective, though they may look different geometrically.|Example: A circle is homeomorphic to a square, because you can continuously deform one into the other without cutting or gluing.|近义词：topological equivalence|反义词：无直接反义词，但可以考虑与“不具有同胚关系”的拓扑空间对比。


USAGE->

一般现在时:
A homeomorphism preserves the topological properties of a space. = 同胚保持空间的拓扑性质。
This function is a homeomorphism between these two manifolds. = 此函数是这两个流形之间的同胚。


一般过去时:
The mathematician proved that the two surfaces were homeomorphic. = 数学家证明了这两个曲面是同胚的。
We found a homeomorphism between the sphere and the torus. = 我们找到了球面和环面之间的同胚。


现在完成时:
Researchers have discovered many interesting homeomorphisms between different spaces. = 研究人员已经发现了不同空间之间许多有趣的同胚。
Mathematicians have long studied the properties of homeomorphisms. = 数学家们长期以来一直在研究同胚的性质。


过去完成时:
Before the proof was completed, we had already identified a potential homeomorphism. = 在证明完成之前，我们已经确定了一个潜在的同胚。
They had shown that the two spaces were not homeomorphic. = 他们已经证明这两个空间不是同胚的。


将来时:
We will explore the concept of homeomorphism in greater detail later. = 我们稍后将更详细地探讨同胚的概念。
This theorem will help us to identify homeomorphisms between complex spaces. = 这个定理将帮助我们识别复杂空间之间的同胚。


虚拟语气:
If this mapping were a homeomorphism, it would preserve connectedness. = 如果这个映射是同胚，它将保持连通性。
I wish I understood the intricacies of homeomorphism theory better. = 我希望我更好地理解同胚理论的复杂性。


被动语态:
The equivalence of the two spaces was demonstrated by a homeomorphism. = 两个空间的等价性是由一个同胚证明的。
The homeomorphism is being applied to analyze the properties of the surface. = 该同胚正被用来分析表面的性质。


疑问句:
Is this transformation a homeomorphism? = 这种变换是同胚吗？
What conditions are necessary for a mapping to be a homeomorphism? = 一个映射成为同胚需要什么条件？


否定句:
That function is not a homeomorphism because it's not continuous. = 该函数不是同胚，因为它不连续。
The two spaces are not homeomorphic because they have a different number of connected components. = 这两个空间不是同胚的，因为它们具有不同数量的连通分量。


PHRASE->

homeomorphism group = 同胚群
homeomorphism theorem = 同胚定理
homeomorphism between manifolds = 流形之间的同胚
homeomorphism class = 同胚类
covering homeomorphism = 覆盖同胚
