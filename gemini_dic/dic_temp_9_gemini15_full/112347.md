lorication:/ˌlɔːrɪˈkeɪʃən/| n. |甲壳化；(动物)形成甲壳|The process of forming a lorica or shell-like covering.  This is often seen in protists and some invertebrates.  The lorica provides protection and support. |例句：The diatom's lorication provided protection from predation.  硅藻的甲壳化提供了免受捕食的保护。

The lorication of the foraminifera is a complex process. 有孔虫的甲壳化是一个复杂的过程。|近义词：shell formation, encasement, armoring|反义词：decalcification, denudation


USAGE->

疑问句:
What triggers lorication in this species? = 什么触发了该物种的甲壳化？
How does the process of lorication impact the organism's survival? = 甲壳化过程如何影响生物体的生存？


否定句:
The organism did not exhibit lorication. = 该生物没有表现出甲壳化。
Some species do not undergo lorication. = 有些物种不进行甲壳化。
