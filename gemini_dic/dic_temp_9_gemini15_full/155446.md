phenogamia:/ˌfiːnoʊˈɡeɪmiə/| n. |显花植物|The term "phenogamia" refers to flowering plants, those plants that produce flowers as their reproductive structures.  It's an older botanical term, less frequently used today in favor of "angiosperms".  The word highlights the visible nature of the reproductive organs (flowers) in these plants, contrasting them with cryptogams (plants without visible reproductive organs).| Example: The study focused on the diversity of phenogamia in the rainforest.  这项研究的重点是热带雨林中显花植物的多样性。|近义词：angiosperms|反义词：cryptogams
