词源:
The word "overdebilitating" is formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or to an excessive degree) to the present participle "debilitating" (from the verb "debilitate").  "Debilitate" comes from the Latin word "debilitare," meaning "to weaken." Therefore, "overdebilitating" signifies a level of weakening that is beyond the usual or normal degree.
