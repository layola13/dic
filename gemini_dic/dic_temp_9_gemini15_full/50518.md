词源:
The word "deprostrate" comes from the prefix "de-" (meaning "down" or "away") and the word "prostrate," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "prostratus," the past participle of "prosternere," meaning "to throw down," "to overthrow," or "to lay flat."  Thus, "deprostrate" combines the sense of being "thrown down" or "laid low," both physically and emotionally.
