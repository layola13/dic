词源:
The word "marshmallow" comes from the marsh-mallow plant (Althaea officinalis).  The root of this plant was traditionally used to make a confection, and the name transferred to the modern, commercially produced sweet.  The plant's name itself is derived from the Old French "althea," ultimately from the Greek "althaía," meaning "to heal."  This reflects the plant's historical use in medicine.
