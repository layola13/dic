词源:
The word "downgrading" is formed from the prefix "down-" (meaning "to a lower level") and the verb "grading" (meaning "to assign a grade or rank").  The root is related to the Old English word "grādan," meaning "to go, walk, step, proceed."  The sense of assigning levels or ranks developed later.
