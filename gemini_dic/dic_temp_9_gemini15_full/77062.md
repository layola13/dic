garnishable:/ˈɡɑːrnɪʃəbəl/ | adj. | 可装饰的；可扣押的 |  capable of being garnished; subject to garnishment.  This refers to two distinct but related meanings:  one relating to food decoration and the other to legal seizure of assets. |

例句1 (food decoration): The cake was garnishable with fresh berries and whipped cream.  这个蛋糕可以用新鲜浆果和鲜奶油装饰。

例句2 (legal seizure):  His wages were garnishable to satisfy the court judgment. 他的工资可以被扣押以满足法院判决。


近义词 (food decoration):  decorable, embellishable

近义词 (legal seizure):  attachable, seizable


反义词 (food decoration): undecorated, plain

反义词 (legal seizure):  exempt, unattachable


词源:  From "garnish," ultimately from Old French *garnir, meaning "to furnish, equip, supply." The legal sense developed later, borrowing the idea of "seizing" or "taking" assets.
