lulu:/ˈluːluː/| n. |露露（女子名）；(非正式)好东西，漂亮东西 |A girl's name; also an informal term for something delightful or attractive.  |例句：Lulu is a popular name for girls. 露露是一个很受欢迎的女孩名字。 My new dress is a real lulu! 我的新裙子真是太漂亮了！|近义词：darling, sweetie, gem |反义词:  trash, junk


USAGE->
This word is primarily a proper noun (a name) and thus doesn't typically inflect through tenses or voice like verbs.  The informal use as a noun describing something delightful doesn't lend itself to grammatical analysis in the same way as a verb.  Therefore, tense and voice examples are not applicable.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "lulu" as a core element.  Its usage is quite limited.
