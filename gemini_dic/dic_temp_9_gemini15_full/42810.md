词源:
The word "courage" ultimately derives from the Old French word "corage," which itself comes from the Latin word "cor," meaning "heart."  The original sense was more closely related to the heart's strength or spirit, rather than just the absence of fear.  Over time, the meaning shifted to emphasize the mental strength needed to overcome fear and adversity.
