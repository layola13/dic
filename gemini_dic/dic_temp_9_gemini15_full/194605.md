词源:  The word is a compound of "self," meaning oneself, and "suspicion,"  meaning a feeling that someone is not honest or trustworthy.  "Suspicion" itself derives from the Old French word "suspicion," ultimately from the Latin "suspicio," meaning "a looking at, examination, suspicion," from "suspicere," meaning "to look up at, suspect." Therefore, self-suspicion literally means "suspecting oneself."
