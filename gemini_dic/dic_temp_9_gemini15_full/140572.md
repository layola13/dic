词源:

The word "oligistic" is derived from the Greek word "oligos" (ὀλίγος), meaning "few," and "-istic," a suffix indicating "relating to" or "characterized by."  Therefore, "oligistic" literally means "relating to a few."  Its application in economics highlights the few powerful entities controlling a market.
