catacrotic:/ˌkætəˈkrɒtɪk/| adj.|降压的；回落性的| Relating to the downward stroke of a pulse wave, particularly the fall in blood pressure after the systolic peak.  The term is often used in the context of electrocardiography and pulse wave analysis. |Example: The patient's blood pressure tracing showed a prominent catacrotic notch.|近义词：descending, falling|反义词：anacrotic


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The catacrotic wave is usually less pronounced than the anacrotic wave. = 降压波通常不如升压波明显。
This medication affects the catacrotic phase of the pulse. = 这种药物影响脉搏的降压期。


一般过去时:
The doctor observed a delayed catacrotic notch on the electrocardiogram. = 医生在心电图上观察到一个延迟的降压切迹。
The patient's catacrotic slope was steeper than normal. = 病人的降压斜率比正常更陡峭。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several factors influencing the catacrotic wave. = 研究人员已经确定了几个影响降压波的因素。
We have found a correlation between heart rate and catacrotic wave amplitude. = 我们发现心率和降压波幅度之间存在相关性。


过去完成时:
Before the intervention, the patient had exhibited a significantly altered catacrotic wave. = 在干预之前，患者表现出明显改变的降压波。
The study had shown that age affected the catacrotic notch morphology. = 该研究表明年龄影响降压切迹的形态。


将来时:
We will analyze the catacrotic phase of the pulse wave in detail. = 我们将详细分析脉搏波的降压期。
Future research will investigate the mechanism behind the catacrotic notch. = 未来的研究将调查降压切迹背后的机制。


虚拟语气:
If the catacrotic wave were more pronounced, it would indicate a specific cardiac condition. = 如果降压波更明显，则表明存在某种特定的心脏疾病。
It is as if the catacrotic notch were absent in this particular ECG tracing. = 就好像在这个特定的心电图描记中缺失了降压切迹。


被动语态:
The catacrotic notch is often measured using automated software. = 降压切迹通常使用自动化软件进行测量。
The shape of the catacrotic wave is influenced by various physiological factors. = 降压波的形状受各种生理因素的影响。


疑问句:
Is the catacrotic wave altered in this patient's ECG? = 这位患者的心电图中降压波是否发生了改变？
What causes the variations in the catacrotic notch? = 什么原因导致降压切迹的变化？


否定句:
The ECG tracing did not show a significant catacrotic notch. = 心电图描记没有显示明显的降压切迹。
This patient's pulse wave does not exhibit a typical catacrotic decline. = 这位患者的脉搏波没有表现出典型的降压下降。


PHRASE->
catacrotic notch: 降压切迹
catacrotic slope: 降压斜率
catacrotic wave: 降压波
catacrotic incisura: 降压切迹 (synonym for catacrotic notch)
analysis of the catacrotic phase: 降压期的分析
