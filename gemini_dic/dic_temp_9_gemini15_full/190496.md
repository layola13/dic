The word "satanity" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word, or a misspelling.


If you intended a different word, or if "satanity" is meant to be a deliberately created term, please provide more context.  With more information, a possible interpretation and analysis could be attempted.  For example, it might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps it's a misspelling of a similar-sounding word with a known meaning.
* **A portmanteau:** It could be a blend of "satan" and another word, creating a new word with a specific meaning within a particular context.
* **A newly coined word:** It might be a word invented for a specific purpose, like in fiction or a niche online community.


Without additional context, any analysis would be purely speculative.
