**USAGE (applicable to both "catholicity's" and "catholicness's"):**

Since these are possessive nouns, they primarily function within possessive structures. There are no specific tense or voice conjugations applicable.  Their usage is always dependent on the noun they modify.

**PHRASE:**

There are no common phrases specifically using "catholicity's" or "catholicness's," given their rarity.  Phrases would be constructed around the possessed noun,  e.g., "the catholicity of his beliefs," "the catholicness of her approach."


**Note:**  Both "catholicity's" and "catholicness's" are unusual word forms.  In most writing, it would be better to rephrase the sentence to avoid using the possessive form and instead use a more standard construction. For example, instead of "the church's catholicity's reach," one could write "the reach of the church's catholicity" or "the church's widely inclusive reach."
