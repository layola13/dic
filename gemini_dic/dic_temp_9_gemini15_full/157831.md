词源:
The word "plagiarized" is derived from the Latin word "plagiārius," meaning "kidnapper" or "abductor."  The original sense referred to the kidnapping of slaves or children.  The literary meaning of stealing someone else's ideas or writings evolved later, drawing a parallel between stealing a person and stealing intellectual property.
