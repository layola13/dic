词源:
The word "mishandle" is a combination of the prefix "mis-" (meaning "badly" or "wrongly") and the verb "handle" (meaning "to manage" or "to deal with").  Therefore, it literally means "to handle badly".  The word's roots trace back to Old English "handlian,"  from "hand" (hand) + "-lian" (a suffix indicating an action or process).
