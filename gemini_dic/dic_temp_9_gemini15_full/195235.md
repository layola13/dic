词源:

The word "semiexpositive" is a combination of:

* **semi-:** A prefix meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."  It comes from Latin.

* **expositive:** An adjective meaning "explanatory," derived from the verb "to expound" (meaning to explain in detail).  This in turn comes from the Latin "exponere," meaning "to set forth," "to explain."


用法说明:

The word "semiexpositive" is primarily used in academic or critical contexts, particularly when discussing writing styles or forms of communication. It is not a word used in everyday conversation.  It suggests that while some explanation is given, a significant portion remains unexplained or unclear.
