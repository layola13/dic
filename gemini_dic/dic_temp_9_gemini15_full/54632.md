词源:

The word "dismissers" is derived from the verb "dismiss," which has roots in the Old French word "desmettre," meaning "to send away,"  "to remove," or "to put aside."  The suffix "-er" forms a noun denoting a person who performs the action of the verb.  Therefore, "dismissers" refers to those who perform the action of dismissing.
