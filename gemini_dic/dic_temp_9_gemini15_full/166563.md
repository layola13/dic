词源:

The word "precious" originates from the Old French word "precieux," which itself derives from the Latin word "pretiosus."  "Pretiosus" is formed from "pretium," meaning "price" or "value," plus the suffix "-osus," indicating "full of" or "abounding in." Therefore, the original meaning implied something of great price or value.


用法说明:

1.  **Describing material objects:**  "Precious" is commonly used to describe objects of high monetary or sentimental value, such as jewels, antiques, or cherished mementos.

2.  **Describing people:** It can be used to describe someone beloved or cherished, often in a slightly informal or affectionate way, especially when referring to children or loved ones.  However, overuse can sound overly sentimental or insincere.

3.  **Figurative use:** "Precious" can be used figuratively to describe something that is rare, valuable, or important in a non-material sense, such as time, opportunity, or knowledge.  It can also be used sarcastically to describe something overly sentimental or affected.

4.  **Emphasis:** The word can be used to add emphasis to the value or importance of something.
