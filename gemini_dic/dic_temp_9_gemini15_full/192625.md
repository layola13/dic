词源:  The word "scurrile" ultimately derives from the Late Latin word *scurribilis*, meaning "jesting," or "buffoonish." This in turn comes from the Latin word *scurra*, meaning "buffoon," "jester," or "scoundrel."  The meaning shifted over time to encompass the offensive and indecent nature often associated with such figures.
