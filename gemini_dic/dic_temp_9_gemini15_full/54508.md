英文解析:

The adjective "disjointed" describes something that is lacking coherence or connection.  It implies a lack of unity or order, where parts are separated and don't fit together smoothly. This can apply to various things, including speech, ideas, arguments, narratives, or even physical objects.  A disjointed argument, for instance, jumps from one point to another without logical transitions. A disjointed narrative lacks a smooth flow and feels fragmented.
