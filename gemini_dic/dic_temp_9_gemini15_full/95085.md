词源:

The word "inalienableness" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the verb "alienate" (meaning "to transfer or estrange"), and the suffix "-ness" (meaning "state or quality").  "Alienate" itself comes from the Latin word "alienare," meaning "to make another's, to estrange."  Therefore, "inalienableness" literally means "the state of not being able to be alienated or transferred."
