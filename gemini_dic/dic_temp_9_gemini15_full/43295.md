词源:

The word "crafty" originates from the Old English word "cræftig," meaning "skillful," "powerful," or "strong."  This root eventually evolved through Middle English to its modern form. The sense shifted over time from simply meaning "skillful" to encompass the more negative connotation of "skillful in deception."
