词源:

The word "landlubberliness" is derived from "landlubber," which is a compound word.  "Land" refers to the land, and "lubber" is an archaic word meaning a clumsy or awkward person.  The suffix "-ness" is added to transform the adjective into a noun, denoting the state or quality of being a landlubber.  The term reflects the historical contrast between those accustomed to life at sea and those who were not.
