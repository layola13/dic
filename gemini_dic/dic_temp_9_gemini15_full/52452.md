词源:
The term "diehard" originated in the late 19th century, combining "die" (meaning "to die") and "hard" (meaning "difficult" or "stubborn").  It initially referred to soldiers who fought fiercely and refused to surrender, even in the face of certain death. The meaning gradually extended to describe anyone stubbornly clinging to their beliefs or commitments.
