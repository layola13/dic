词源:  The word "robustest" derives from the Old French word "robuster," meaning "strong" or "vigorous."  This, in turn, has roots in the Latin word "robustus," which also means "strong," "hardy," or "oak-like."  The "-est" suffix indicates the superlative degree, signifying the highest degree of the quality.
