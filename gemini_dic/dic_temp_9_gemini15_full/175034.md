radiodensity: /ˌreɪdiəʊˈdensɪti/ | n. | 射线密度 | The degree to which a substance or tissue absorbs X-rays or other forms of radiation.  It is a measure of how opaque the substance is to radiation.  Higher radiodensity means greater absorption of radiation, appearing whiter on a radiograph. | Example:  The radiodensity of bone is much higher than that of soft tissue. 骨骼的射线密度远高于软组织。 The increased radiodensity in the lung field suggested a possible pneumonia. 肺部的射线密度增加提示可能存在肺炎。 | 近义词: opacity, attenuation  | 反义词: radiolucency |  名词
