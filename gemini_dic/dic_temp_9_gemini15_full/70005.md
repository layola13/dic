词源:
The word "fetichist" comes from the Portuguese word "feitiço," meaning "charm" or "amulet."  This term was adopted by anthropologists to describe objects believed to possess magical powers, and later evolved to encompass the psychological phenomenon of sexual attraction to such objects or other non-genital body parts.
