homothermic:/ˌhoʊməˈθɜːrmɪk/ | adj. | 同温性的；恒温的 |  Maintaining a relatively constant internal body temperature, regardless of external temperature fluctuations.  This is characteristic of mammals and birds. | Example:  Mammals are homothermic animals, meaning they can regulate their body temperature internally. 哺乳动物是恒温动物，这意味着它们可以内部调节体温。 |近义词: warm-blooded, endothermic | 反义词: poikilothermic, cold-blooded

USAGE->
一般现在时:
Birds maintain a homothermic body temperature. = 鸟类保持恒定的体温。

过去完成时:
Before the discovery, it was believed that only birds and mammals were homothermic. = 在这项发现之前，人们认为只有鸟类和哺乳动物是恒温的。
The scientists had already established that the species was homothermic. = 科学家们已经确定该物种是恒温的。

将来时:
Future research will further explore the mechanisms of homothermic regulation. = 未来的研究将进一步探索恒温调节的机制。

被动语态:
The body temperature was maintained at a homothermic level. = 体温保持在恒温水平。
The homothermic nature of the animal was confirmed by the experiment. = 该动物的恒温特性得到了实验的证实。

疑问句:
Is this species homothermic or poikilothermic? = 这个物种是恒温的还是变温的？
Are all mammals truly homothermic? = 所有哺乳动物都是真正的恒温动物吗？

否定句:
This reptile is not homothermic; it is poikilothermic. = 这种爬行动物不是恒温的；它是变温的。
The evidence does not support the claim that this insect is homothermic. = 证据不支持这种昆虫是恒温动物的说法。
