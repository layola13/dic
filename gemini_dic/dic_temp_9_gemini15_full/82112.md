词源:  The word "groggily" derives from "grog," a type of strong alcoholic drink. The term "grog" itself is believed to have originated in the early 18th century, possibly named after Admiral Edward Vernon, who was nicknamed "Old Grog" because of his fondness for wearing a grogram coat.  Over time, the term "grog" came to be associated with intoxication, and consequently, "groggily" describes the mannerisms of someone under the influence of alcohol or simply very sleepy.  The "-ily" suffix transforms the noun into an adverb, modifying verbs to indicate how an action is performed.
