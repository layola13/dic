modulus:/ˈmɒdʒʊləs/ /ˈmɑːdʒʊləs/| n. |模数；模；模量；余数 |The modulus is a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in number theory and abstract algebra. It represents the remainder after division. In materials science, it refers to a measure of elasticity or stiffness.  |Example: The modulus of elasticity is a measure of a material's stiffness.  弹性模量是衡量材料刚度的指标。  The modulus of 17 divided by 5 is 2. 17除以5的余数是2。|近义词：remainder, measure, factor|反义词：N/A
