premosaic: /ˌpriːmoʊˈzeɪɪk/ | adj. | 预镶嵌的；前镶嵌的 |  Relating to or denoting a stage in development before the formation of a mosaic; existing or occurring before the formation of a mosaic.  | Example: The premosaic stage of development is crucial for understanding the final pattern.  预镶嵌发育阶段对于理解最终模式至关重要。 | 近义词:  antecedent, preliminary | 反义词: postmosaic


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The premosaic pattern is visible under the microscope. = 预镶嵌模式在显微镜下可见。
This process is premosaic in nature. = 这个过程本质上是预镶嵌的。


一般过去时:
The researchers observed the premosaic stage of cell division. = 研究人员观察了细胞分裂的预镶嵌阶段。
The premosaic structure was clearly defined. = 预镶嵌结构清晰可见。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several genes involved in premosaic development. = 科学家们已经确定了几种参与预镶嵌发育的基因。
We have observed this premosaic arrangement in multiple species. = 我们已经在多个物种中观察到这种预镶嵌排列。


过去完成时:
Before the mosaic was formed, the cells had already undergone premosaic differentiation. = 在镶嵌体形成之前，细胞已经经历了预镶嵌分化。
The system had exhibited a clear premosaic pattern prior to the final stage. = 在最终阶段之前，该系统已经表现出清晰的预镶嵌模式。


将来时:
Future research will focus on the genetic mechanisms underlying premosaic patterning. = 未来的研究将集中在预镶嵌图案的遗传机制上。
We will analyze the premosaic distribution of the proteins. = 我们将分析蛋白质的预镶嵌分布。


虚拟语气:
If the premosaic pattern were disrupted, the final outcome would be different. = 如果预镶嵌模式被破坏，最终结果将不同。
It would be helpful if we had more data on premosaic stages. = 如果我们有更多关于预镶嵌阶段的数据，那就有帮助了。


被动语态:
The premosaic stage is often overlooked in current research. = 预镶嵌阶段在当前的研究中经常被忽视。
The premosaic arrangement of cells was carefully documented. = 细胞的预镶嵌排列被仔细记录下来。


疑问句:
Is this structure premosaic in origin? = 这种结构的起源是预镶嵌的吗？
What are the key characteristics of the premosaic stage? = 预镶嵌阶段的主要特征是什么？


否定句:
The pattern is not premosaic; it's a post-mosaic formation. = 该模式不是预镶嵌的；它是镶嵌后形成的。
The cells did not exhibit a clear premosaic arrangement. = 细胞没有表现出清晰的预镶嵌排列。
