词源:  The word is derived from "highbrow," which itself originated in the early 20th century.  "Highbrow" originally referred to someone with refined tastes and intellectual interests, but over time, it took on a more negative connotation, suggesting pretentiousness. The suffix "-ish" adds a slightly diminishing or less intense quality to the word, implying a tendency towards highbrow behavior rather than a fully committed embodiment of it.
