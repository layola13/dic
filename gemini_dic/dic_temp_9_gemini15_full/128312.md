词源:

The word "neurotically" derives from the noun "neurosis," which comes from the Greek word "neuron" (νεῦρον), meaning "nerve."  The suffix "-otic" indicates a relating to or pertaining to. Thus, "neurotic" originally referred to a nervous disorder, and "neurotically" describes behavior stemming from such a condition.  The meaning has broadened to encompass more general anxiety and obsessive behaviors.
