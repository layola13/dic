词源:

The word "outgoing" comes from the combination of "out" (meaning away from a place) and "going" (the present participle of the verb "to go").  Its meaning evolved from the literal sense of "departing" or "leaving" to the figurative sense of being socially extroverted and active.  The shift in meaning reflects the idea that outgoing individuals are those who actively "go out" and engage with the world.
