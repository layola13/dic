词源：The word "opiniated" comes from the noun "opinion," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "opinio," meaning "opinion," "belief," or "judgment." The suffix "-ated" is a past participle suffix indicating a state or condition.  Therefore, "opiniated" literally means "having opinions," but with the strong connotation of being excessively or unreasonably attached to those opinions.
