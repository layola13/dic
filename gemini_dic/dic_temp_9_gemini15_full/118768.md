词源:

The word "metallist" is a relatively modern term, formed by combining "metal" (referring to heavy metal music) with the suffix "-ist," which denotes a person who practices, performs, or is associated with a particular activity or art form.  The term's emergence parallels the growth and popularization of the heavy metal music genre itself.
