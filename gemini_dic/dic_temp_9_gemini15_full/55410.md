distich:/ˈdɪstɪk/| n.|对句；(诗歌中的) 二行诗句|A distich is a pair of successive lines of verse, especially one forming a complete thought or syntactic unit.  It is often found in poetry, and can be rhyming or unrhyming.|Example:  The following lines from Shakespeare's Sonnet 18 form a distich: "So long as men can breathe or eyes can see, / So long lives this, and this gives life to thee."  这句莎士比亚第18首十四行诗中的两行组成一个对句：“只要人们能呼吸，眼睛能看见，/这诗就长存，这诗给你生命。”|近义词：couplet (if rhyming)|反义词：stanza (if referring to a longer poetic unit)
