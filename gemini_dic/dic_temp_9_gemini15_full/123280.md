monoethanolamine:/ˌmɒnəʊˌiːθænˈɒləmiːn/| n. |一乙醇胺|Monoethanolamine (MEA) is an organic compound with the formula HOCH2CH2NH2.  It is a colorless, viscous liquid that is miscible with water and many organic solvents.  It's a primary amino alcohol, meaning it contains both an amine group (-NH2) and an alcohol group (-OH). MEA is a weak base and readily absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2), a property exploited in various industrial applications. |例句：MEA is commonly used in gas treating processes to remove CO2 from natural gas.  一乙醇胺常用在气体处理过程中去除天然气中的二氧化碳。

The synthesis of MEA involves reacting ethylene oxide with ammonia.  一乙醇胺的合成涉及环氧乙烷与氨的反应。|近义词：ethanolamine (a broader term)|反义词：N/A

词源:
The name "monoethanolamine" is derived from its chemical structure.  "Mono" indicates one molecule of ethylene oxide reacting, "ethanolamine" refers to the resulting compound containing both an ethane (-CH2CH2-) group and an amine (-NH2) group and an alcohol (-OH) group.
