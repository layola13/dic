词源：The word "gunboat" is a compound word formed from "gun" and "boat".  It reflects the vessel's primary function: carrying and deploying guns.  The earliest recorded use of the term dates back to the 19th century, coinciding with the increased use of such vessels in colonial expansion and riverine warfare.
