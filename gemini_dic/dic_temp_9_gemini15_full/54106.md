PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "disembowelment" as it's a highly specific and infrequent term.  Instead, phrases would focus on the act or its consequences, such as:

method of disembowelment  剖腹的方法
evidence of disembowelment 剖腹的证据
horrific disembowelment  可怕的剖腹
gruesome disembowelment  令人毛骨悚然的剖腹
scene of disembowelment 剖腹现场


词源:
dis- (否定前缀) + embowel (to put in the bowels or intestines)  + -ment (名词后缀)

The word "embowel" itself is now largely archaic, but its meaning is clear from the context of "disembowelment."  The prefix "dis-" negates the meaning, hence "removal from the bowels."
