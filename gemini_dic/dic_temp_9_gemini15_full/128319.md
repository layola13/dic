neurotoxicity:/ˌnʊroʊtɒksɪsɪti/| n. |神经毒性 |The toxic effect of a substance on the nervous system.  Neurotoxicity can manifest in various ways depending on the substance, dosage, and route of exposure.  It can range from mild symptoms like headache and dizziness to severe neurological damage, including paralysis and death. | Example:  Exposure to certain pesticides can cause neurotoxicity, leading to tremors and cognitive impairment.  = 接触某些杀虫剂会导致神经毒性，从而导致震颤和认知障碍。


The long-term effects of this medication are still being studied, with particular concerns about potential neurotoxicity. = 这种药物的长期影响仍在研究中，尤其关注其潜在的神经毒性。

近义词： nerve damage, neural toxicity | 反义词：neuroprotection
