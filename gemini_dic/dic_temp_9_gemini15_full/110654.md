The word "linch" does not appear to be a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Perhaps you could provide more context where you encountered this word.

2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a place name, a surname, or a brand name.  Again, context is needed.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a regional dialect word, or slang not yet widely recognized.

4. **It's a typo:**  A simple typographical error.

Without further information, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible. Please provide more context so I can help you.
