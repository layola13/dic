词源:

The word "displayer" is derived from the verb "display," which comes from the Old French word "despleier," meaning "to unfold, spread out."  The suffix "-er" is an agentive suffix, indicating a person or thing that performs the action of the verb.  Therefore, "displayer" literally means "one who displays" or "a device that displays."
