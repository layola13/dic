词源:
The word "seashell" is a compound word.  "Sea" refers to the ocean, and "shell" refers to the hard outer covering of various creatures.  The combination "seashell" specifically refers to shells found in the sea.  The etymology of "shell" itself is from Old English *scel, related to Old High German *scalha and ultimately to Proto-Indo-European *skel- meaning "shell, husk".
