WORD ORIGIN->
Connoisseurship derives from the word "connoisseur,"  which comes from the Old French *connoisseur*, meaning "knowing, skilled."  This, in turn, is from the verb *connoistre*, meaning "to know," related to the Latin *cognoscere*, meaning "to know, learn, understand."  The suffix "-ship" denotes "the state or quality of being." Therefore, connoisseurship literally means "the state or quality of being knowledgeable and skilled in a particular area of expertise, especially in the arts."
