keymap:/ˈkiːmæp/ | n. | 键位图，按键映射 | A keymap is a representation of the correspondence between physical keys on a keyboard and the characters or commands they produce.  It defines how each key or key combination translates into input for a computer or other device. For example, a keymap might specify that pressing the "A" key produces the letter "a", while pressing "Ctrl" + "C" copies selected text. | Example: The default keymap on this keyboard is QWERTY, but I've customized it to a Dvorak layout for improved typing efficiency. |近义词：keyboard layout, key assignment |反义词：无
