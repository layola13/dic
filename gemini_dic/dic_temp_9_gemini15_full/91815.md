词源:
The word "hyperform" is a relatively recent coinage, combining "hyper" (meaning "above," "beyond," or "excessive") with "form" (referring to the shape, structure, or composition of a material or substance).  Therefore, it literally means "beyond-performance form" or "excessively-performing form".  Its creation reflects the increasing need for a concise term to describe materials with significantly enhanced capabilities.
