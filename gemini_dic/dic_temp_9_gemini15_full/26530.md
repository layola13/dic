The word "cabell" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you intended another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name or place-name, specific to a certain region or family.
* **It's a neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or informal term not yet widely recognized.
* **It's from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into English.

If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
