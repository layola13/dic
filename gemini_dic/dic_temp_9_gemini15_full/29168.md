词源:
The word "cashability" is derived from the word "cash" and the suffix "-ability," which indicates the capacity or potential for something. "Cash" ultimately comes from the Old French "casse," meaning "box," referring to a money box or chest.  The suffix "-ability" comes from the Latin "-abilitas," meaning "ability" or "capacity."  Therefore, "cashability" signifies the ability of something to be converted into cash.
