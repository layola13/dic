词源:
The word "exorbitantly" is derived from the word "exorbitant," which comes from the Late Latin word "exorbitans," meaning "straying from the orbit," or figuratively, "going beyond proper limits".  The prefix "ex-" means "out of" or "beyond," and "orbit" refers to a path or course.  Therefore, "exorbitant" originally described something that deviated from its proper course or bounds, and "exorbitantly" modifies actions or states exhibiting this excessive nature.
