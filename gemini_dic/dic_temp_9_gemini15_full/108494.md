词源:  The word "layest" is the archaic second-person singular past tense form of the verb "lay." It comes from the Old English verb *lecgan*, meaning "to lay" or "to place."  The "-est" ending is a characteristic of the second-person singular past tense in older forms of English.  This form is rarely used in modern English.
