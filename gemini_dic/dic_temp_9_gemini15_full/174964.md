词源:

The term "radical-chics" is a relatively modern compound word. "Radical" comes from the Latin word "radix," meaning "root," and has evolved to signify something fundamental or extreme. "Chics" is the plural of "chic,"  ultimately derived from the French word "chic," meaning stylish, elegant, or fashionable.  The combination thus describes women who are stylish but in a dramatically unconventional or rebellious way.
