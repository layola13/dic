词源:  Derived from the verb "rally," meaning to come together or recover strength. The "-ingly" suffix transforms the verb into an adverb, describing the manner in which something is done.  The root of "rally" can be traced back to the Old French word "rallier," meaning "to reassemble, reunite."


USAGE->
This word is an adverb, and thus does not inflect for tense, person, number, or voice.  It describes the manner in which an action is performed.  There's no need for separate examples for different grammatical tenses.


PHRASE->
There are no common set phrases directly using "rallyingly."  The word itself functions as a modifier to a verb, describing the way an action is done.  For example, one might say "He spoke rallyingly," but this is not a set phrase.
