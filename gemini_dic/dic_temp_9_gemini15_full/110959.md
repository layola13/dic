liquefiable:/ˈlɪkwɪfaɪəbl/| adj.| 可液化的；可液态化的 | Capable of being liquefied; able to be converted into a liquid state.  |例句：Under high pressure, many gases are liquefiable.  在高压下，许多气体都是可液化的。 |例句：The process involves heating the solid until it becomes liquefiable. 这个过程包括加热固体直到它变成可液化的。|近义词：meltable, fusible |反义词：infusible, unmeltable


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The gas is liquefiable under pressure. =这种气体在压力下是可液化的。
This substance is easily liquefiable. =这种物质很容易液化。

一般过去时:
The scientists found that the material was liquefiable. =科学家们发现这种材料是可液化的。
The experiment showed the substance was readily liquefiable. =实验表明该物质很容易液化。

现在完成时:
They have discovered that many materials are liquefiable under specific conditions. =他们已经发现许多物质在特定条件下是可液化的。
Scientists have successfully liquefied a previously unliquefiable gas. =科学家们成功地液化了一种以前无法液化的气体。

过去完成时:
They had already determined that the compound was liquefiable before starting the experiment. =在开始实验之前，他们已经确定该化合物是可液化的。
Researchers had found that the substance was not liquefiable at room temperature. =研究人员发现该物质在室温下不可液化。

将来时:
This new technology will allow us to liquefy previously unliquefiable substances. =这项新技术将使我们能够液化以前无法液化的物质。
We will investigate whether this material is liquefiable at low temperatures. =我们将研究这种物质在低温下是否可液化。

虚拟语气:
If the substance were liquefiable, the process would be much simpler. =如果这种物质可液化，这个过程就会简单得多。
I wish this material were more easily liquefiable. =我希望这种物质更容易液化。

被动语态:
The gas was liquefied under high pressure. =这种气体在高压下被液化了。
The solid material can be liquefied by heating. =固体材料可以通过加热液化。

疑问句:
Is this material liquefiable at room temperature? =这种物质在室温下可液化吗？
Are all gases liquefiable under sufficient pressure? =所有气体在足够压力下都能液化吗？

否定句:
This substance is not liquefiable at normal atmospheric pressure. =这种物质在正常大气压下不可液化。
That compound proved to be non-liquefiable. =那个化合物被证明是不可液化的。


PHRASE->
