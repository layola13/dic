chiastic:/kaɪˈæstɪk/| adj.| 交叉的；对称的；十字形的 | Relating to or characterized by chiasmus;  a figure of speech in which two successive clauses or phrases are parallel in syntax but reverse in the order of the corresponding words.  It's a rhetorical device where the grammatical structure of the first clause or phrase is inverted in the second, creating a mirror-like effect. | Example: "Never let a fool kiss you or a kiss fool you."  This sentence uses chiasmus, as the structure of the first half ("Never let a fool kiss you") is reversed in the second half ("or a kiss fool you"). | 近义词： crisscross, intersecting, inverted | 反义词：parallel (in the sense of lacking inversion)


Etymology: From Greek *χιασμός (khiasmós), from χιάζω (khiázō) "to mark with an X," from χ (khi) "chi," the Greek letter X.
