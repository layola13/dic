词源:
The word "nonaristocratic" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "aristocratic," which ultimately derives from the Greek words "aristos" (meaning "best") and "kratos" (meaning "power" or "rule").  Thus, "aristocratic" originally referred to those belonging to the ruling class, considered the "best" in society.  The addition of "non-" reverses this meaning.
