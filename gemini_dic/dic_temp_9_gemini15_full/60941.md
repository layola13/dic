词源:
The word "elevator" comes from the verb "elevate," meaning "to raise or lift up."  This ultimately derives from the Latin word "elevare," which is a combination of "e-" (out, up) and "levare" (to lift, raise).  The word's meaning and function naturally extended to the mechanical device that elevates people and objects.
