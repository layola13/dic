词源：

The word "saliency" is derived from the French word "saillant," meaning "projecting," "standing out," or "conspicuous."  This, in turn, comes from the Latin word "salire," meaning "to leap" or "to jump."  The implied meaning is that something salient leaps out at you or jumps to your attention.
