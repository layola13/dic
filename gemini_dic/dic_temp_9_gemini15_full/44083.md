词源：
The word "criosphinx" is a modern coinage, a blend of "crio-" (from Greek *κρύος* *kryos*, meaning "frost," "ice," or "cold") and "sphinx."  It's a creative combination reflecting the icy imagery often associated with the invented creature.  There's no ancient or established meaning for the term.
