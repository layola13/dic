词源:
The word "fainthearted" is a compound word.  "Faint" meaning weak or lacking strength, and "hearted" referring to the heart, the seat of emotion and courage.  Therefore, "fainthearted" literally means having a weak heart in terms of courage.  The word's origins trace back to the Old English words "fægen" (glad, joyful) and "heorte" (heart), although the modern meaning has evolved from a literal weakening of the heart to a metaphorical lack of courage.
