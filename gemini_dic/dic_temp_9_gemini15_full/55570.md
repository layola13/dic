词源:
The word "disturbed" comes from the verb "disturb," which is formed from the Old French word "destourber," meaning "to push aside," "to hinder," or "to upset."  The prefix "de-" indicates removal or reversal, and "tourber" relates to the idea of troubling or confusing.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass emotional and mental states as well as physical disruptions.
