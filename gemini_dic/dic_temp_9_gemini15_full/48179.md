decomposable:/ˌdiːkəmˈpoʊzəbəl/ | adj. | 可分解的；可拆卸的 | Able to be decomposed or separated into constituent parts.  This adjective describes something that can be broken down into simpler components.  It often implies a systematic or organized breakdown, rather than a random disintegration. | Example: The software is decomposable into modules, making it easier to maintain.  这个软件可以分解成模块，从而更容易维护。 The complex problem was decomposable into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.  这个复杂的问题可以分解成更小、更容易管理的子问题。 | 近义词：separable, divisible, analyzable | 反义词：indivisible, inseparable, unanalyzable
