nonstationarity:/ˌnɒnˌsteɪʃəˈnærɪti/| n. |非平稳性|The property of a time series or process whose statistical properties, such as mean, variance, or autocorrelation, change over time.  This contrasts with stationarity, where these properties remain constant.  Nonstationarity is a common characteristic of many real-world time series data, including financial markets, climate data, and physiological signals. |The analysis of nonstationary time series data requires specialized techniques, as traditional methods that assume stationarity may produce misleading results. For example, the stock market's price is a classic example of nonstationarity, as its mean and volatility change significantly over time.
