ergodic:/ɜːrˈɡɒdɪk/| adj.|遍历的；遍历性的|Of or relating to an ergodic process, a stochastic process whose time average equals its ensemble average.  In simpler terms, it means that a system will eventually visit all possible states if given enough time.  The term is frequently used in mathematics, statistics, and physics, particularly in the study of dynamical systems and stochastic processes.|例句：The ergodic hypothesis is crucial to statistical mechanics. 遍历假设对统计力学至关重要。

The random walk is an example of an ergodic process. 随机游走是遍历过程的一个例子。
