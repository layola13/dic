kilohertz:/ˈkɪləhɜːrts/| n. |千赫兹|Kilohertz (kHz) is a unit of frequency equal to one thousand hertz (Hz).  It's used to measure the number of cycles or oscillations per second of a wave, often in the context of sound or radio waves.|The radio station broadcasts at 98.5 kilohertz.|近义词：thousand hertz|反义词:  (No direct antonym;  context-dependent, e.g., megahertz for higher frequency)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The radio operates at 100 kilohertz. = 收音机在100千赫兹的频率下运行。
This device measures frequency in kilohertz. = 此设备以千赫兹为单位测量频率。

一般过去时:
The signal transmitted at 50 kilohertz yesterday. = 昨天信号以50千赫兹的频率传输。
The old equipment only handled up to 10 kilohertz. = 旧设备只能处理高达10千赫兹的频率。

现在完成时:
We have measured the frequency in kilohertz for years. = 我们多年来一直在以千赫兹为单位测量频率。
The scientists have discovered a new signal in the kilohertz range. = 科学家们发现了一种新的千赫兹范围内的信号。

过去完成时:
They had already calibrated the equipment to kilohertz before the experiment. = 他们在实验前已经将设备校准到千赫兹。
The engineers had found that the system operated most efficiently at 20 kilohertz. = 工程师们发现该系统在20千赫兹的频率下运行效率最高。

将来时:
The new system will operate at higher kilohertz frequencies. = 新系统将在更高的千赫兹频率下运行。
They will measure the sound waves in kilohertz during the test. = 他们在测试期间将以千赫兹为单位测量声波。

虚拟语气:
If the frequency were higher than 10 kilohertz, the signal would be clearer. = 如果频率高于10千赫兹，信号会更清晰。
I wish the equipment could handle frequencies up to 100 kilohertz. = 我希望设备能够处理高达100千赫兹的频率。

被动语态:
The frequency is measured in kilohertz. = 频率以千赫兹为单位测量。
The signal was transmitted at 90 kilohertz. = 信号以90千赫兹的频率传输。

疑问句:
What is the frequency of this signal in kilohertz? = 此信号的频率是多少千赫兹？
At what kilohertz does this device operate best? = 此设备在多少千赫兹下运行最佳？

否定句:
The signal was not transmitted at 100 kilohertz. = 信号并非以100千赫兹的频率传输。
This device does not operate below 5 kilohertz. = 此设备在5千赫兹以下不运行。
