词源:
The word "melancholia" comes from the Greek words "melas" (μέλας), meaning "black," and "chole" (χολή), meaning "bile."  In ancient Greek humoral theory, melancholia was believed to be caused by an imbalance of black bile in the body.  The plural form "melancholias" simply adds the plural suffix "-s".
