multipotent:/ˈmʌltiˌpoʊtənt/| adj. |多能的，多潜能的 |Able to differentiate into more than one, but not all, cell types.  Multipotent cells are less versatile than pluripotent cells, which can develop into any cell type. |Example:  Hematopoietic stem cells are multipotent, giving rise to various blood cell types.造血干细胞是多能的，可以产生各种血细胞类型。|近义词:pluripotent (to a lesser extent), pleuripotent |反义词:unipotent, totipotent
