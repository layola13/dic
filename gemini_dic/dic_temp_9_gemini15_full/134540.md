nonlinearity:/ˌnɒnˌlɪniˈærɪti/| /ˌnɑːnˌlɪniˈærɪti/| n. |非线性；非线性现象|The property of not being linear;  a departure from proportionality between cause and effect.  This is common in many real-world systems where a small change in input can lead to a disproportionately large change in output. For example,  the relationship between force and acceleration might not always follow a straight line.|The climate system exhibits significant nonlinearity, making accurate long-term predictions challenging.  气候系统表现出显著的非线性，使得准确的长期预测具有挑战性。The response of the circuit to the input signal showed significant nonlinearity. 电路对输入信号的响应显示出明显的非线性。|linearity|linearity|
