metamict:/ˈmɛtəmɪkt/| adj.| 变质的；非晶质的 |  Describes a crystalline material that has become amorphous (lacking a defined crystal structure) due to self-irradiation from radioactive decay of constituent elements.  This process disrupts the original crystal lattice, leading to changes in physical properties like density, hardness, and color. | Example: The zircon crystals showed signs of being metamict due to the presence of uranium and thorium.  锆石晶体由于铀和钍的存在而显示出变质的迹象。|近义词：amorphous, disordered |反义词：crystalline, ordered |


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The zircon is metamict. = 锆石是变质的。
This material appears metamict under the microscope. = 在显微镜下，这种材料看起来是变质的。


一般过去时:
The sample became metamict over millions of years. = 样品在数百万年的时间里变成了变质的。
The radiation damaged the crystal, making it metamict. = 辐射破坏了晶体，使其变质。


现在完成时:
The mineral has become metamict due to internal radiation. = 矿物由于内部辐射而变成了变质的。
Scientists have observed many metamict minerals. = 科学家们已经观察到许多变质矿物。


过去完成时:
The crystal had already become metamict before the analysis. = 在分析之前，晶体就已经变质了。
The researchers found that the mineral had been metamict for eons. = 研究人员发现这种矿物已经变质了无数个时代。


将来时:
Further irradiation will likely make the sample metamict. = 进一步的辐射很可能会使样品变质。
The mineral will probably become metamict in the future. = 这种矿物将来可能会变质。


虚拟语气:
If the sample contained more uranium, it would be metamict. = 如果样品含有更多的铀，它就会变质。
I wish I had known the sample was metamict earlier. = 我真希望我早点知道样品是变质的。


被动语态:
The crystal was rendered metamict by radioactive decay. = 晶体因放射性衰变而变成变质的。
Many minerals are made metamict by natural processes. = 许多矿物都是通过自然过程变成变质的。


疑问句:
Is this mineral metamict? = 这种矿物是变质的吗？
Are all zircon crystals metamict? = 所有锆石晶体都是变质的吗？


否定句:
The crystal is not metamict; it is crystalline. = 晶体不是变质的；它是晶体的。
This sample did not show any signs of being metamict. = 这个样品没有显示任何变质的迹象。


PHRASE->
