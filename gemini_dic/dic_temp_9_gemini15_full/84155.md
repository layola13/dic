half-oxidized: /ˌhæfˈɒksɪdaɪzd/ | adj. | 半氧化的 | Partially oxidized; describing a substance where only some of its atoms have lost electrons.  This term is often used in chemistry and materials science to describe a state intermediate between fully reduced and fully oxidized states.  | Example: The half-oxidized state of the metal catalyst was crucial for its activity. 半氧化的金属催化剂状态对其活性至关重要。 | 近义词: partially oxidized, incompletely oxidized | 反义词: fully oxidized, fully reduced |


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The metal is half-oxidized. = 金属处于半氧化状态。
The sample shows a half-oxidized surface. = 样品显示出半氧化的表面。


一般过去时:
The compound was half-oxidized during the reaction. = 该化合物在反应过程中被半氧化。
The material became half-oxidized after exposure to air. = 材料暴露在空气中后变成了半氧化状态。


现在完成时:
The catalyst has been half-oxidized. = 催化剂已经被半氧化了。
The surface has become half-oxidized over time. = 表面随着时间的推移变得半氧化了。


过去完成时:
The reaction had already half-oxidized the substrate before the addition of the reagent. = 在添加试剂之前，反应已经将底物半氧化了。
The sample had been half-oxidized prior to analysis. = 样品在分析之前就已经半氧化了。


将来时:
The material will be half-oxidized under these conditions. = 在这些条件下，材料将被半氧化。
The experiment will show that the compound is half-oxidized. = 实验将表明该化合物是半氧化的。


虚拟语气:
If the temperature were higher, the compound would be half-oxidized. = 如果温度更高，化合物将被半氧化。
It is unlikely that the sample would be half-oxidized under normal conditions. = 在正常条件下，样品不太可能被半氧化。


被动语态:
The substance was half-oxidized by the oxidizing agent. = 该物质被氧化剂半氧化了。
The sample is being half-oxidized in the furnace. = 样品正在炉中被半氧化。


疑问句:
Is the material half-oxidized? = 材料是半氧化的吗？
Has the reaction half-oxidized the substrate? = 反应是否将底物半氧化了？


否定句:
The material is not half-oxidized; it is fully oxidized. = 材料不是半氧化的；它是完全氧化的。
The sample was not half-oxidized, but rather fully reduced. = 样品不是半氧化的，而是完全还原的。


PHRASE->
half-oxidized state 半氧化态
degree of half-oxidation 半氧化程度
half-oxidized layer 半氧化层
half-oxidized surface 半氧化表面
characterization of half-oxidized materials 半氧化材料的表征
