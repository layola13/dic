refolding: /ˌriːˈfoʊldɪŋ/ | n. | 再折叠；重新折叠 | The process of restoring a protein or other molecule to its native three-dimensional structure after it has been denatured or unfolded.  This is often crucial in protein biochemistry and biotechnology. | Example: The refolding of the protein was successful, restoring its enzymatic activity.  重新折叠蛋白质成功了，恢复了它的酶活性。|近义词：reconfiguration, restructuring |反义词：unfolding, denaturation

USAGE->
