词源:
The word "defame" comes from Old French *desfamer*, meaning "to slander, to speak ill of".  The prefix "de-" indicates "away from" or "removal of," while the root "-famer" is related to Latin *fama*, meaning "fame, reputation".  Therefore, the original meaning points to the removal or damaging of one's good reputation.
