presatisfactory: /ˌpriːˌsætɪsˈfæktəri/ | adj. |尚可的，勉强令人满意的|  Acceptable but not particularly good; barely satisfactory.  The word combines "pre-" meaning "before" or "in anticipation of," and "satisfactory," indicating a level of fulfillment. However, the "pre-" prefix suggests that it falls short of complete satisfaction. It implies a feeling that something is adequate only in a minimal sense.  |例句：The results were presatisfactory, but we need to improve significantly. 结果勉强令人满意，但我们需要大幅改进。


The project's progress is presatisfactory, requiring additional effort. 项目进展尚可，需要付出更多努力。|近义词：adequate, sufficient, passable, tolerable |反义词：unsatisfactory, inadequate, disappointing, excellent
