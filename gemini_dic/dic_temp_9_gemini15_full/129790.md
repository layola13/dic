The word "non-Flemings" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It seems to be a made-up word, likely intended to refer to people who are not Flemings.  Therefore, a full etymological and grammatical analysis cannot be provided. However, we can analyze its potential meaning and structure:


**non-Flemings:**

/nɒnˈflɛmɪŋz/ | n. | 非弗拉芒人 | People who are not of Flemish origin or nationality.  This word is derived by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "Flemings," which refers to the people of Flanders (a region in Belgium).


**Etymology:**

* **non-:**  A prefix of English origin meaning "not," "opposite of," or "lacking."  It's derived from Latin "non," the negative adverb.
* **Flemings:** This refers to the inhabitants of Flanders, a region in Belgium historically part of the Burgundian Netherlands. The origin of the term "Flemish" is uncertain, but it is linked to the Germanic tribes who inhabited the area.


**Usage:**

The word would be used in a similar manner to other terms indicating exclusion, such as "non-Americans" or "non-Europeans."  It would be used in contexts where a distinction is being made between Flemings and others.


**Example Sentences:**

The survey was conducted to determine the opinions of both Flemings and non-Flemings regarding the new policy. =  这项调查旨在确定弗拉芒人和非弗拉芒人对这项新政策的看法。

**Note:** Because "non-Flemings" is not a standard word, its usage might be perceived as slightly awkward or unusual.  More common and natural alternatives like "non-Flemish people" are preferable in most contexts.  The grammatical properties are identical to other plural nouns.
