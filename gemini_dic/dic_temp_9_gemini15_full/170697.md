pseudoanaemia:/ˌsuːdəʊəˈniːmiə/| n. |假性贫血|A condition that mimics the symptoms of anemia (low red blood cell count) but is not caused by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin.  Instead, it's due to other factors that affect how the body transports or utilizes oxygen. Examples include fluid retention, which dilutes the blood, making it seem like there are fewer red blood cells. |Example:  The patient presented with symptoms of fatigue and pallor, leading to a suspicion of anemia, but further tests revealed it was pseudoanemia due to fluid overload.  病人出现疲劳和苍白的症状，让人怀疑是贫血，但进一步的检查显示这是由于液体超负荷引起的假性贫血。|近义词：pseudoanemia, false anemia |反义词：true anemia, iron-deficiency anemia
