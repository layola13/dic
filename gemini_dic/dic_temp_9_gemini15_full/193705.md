词源:

The word is a compound of "self-" (meaning oneself) and "confiding" (meaning trusting or revealing).  The "confiding" element here takes on a slightly different nuance, implying a trust in one's own abilities that borders on overconfidence.  The overall meaning shifts from simply being confident to being excessively so, often to a negative degree.
