mesosauria:/ˌmɛsoʊˈsɔəriə/| n. | 中龙类 | Mesosauria is an extinct order of aquatic reptiles that lived during the Early Permian period.  They were among the earliest known reptiles to have adapted to a fully aquatic lifestyle.  They possessed a long, slender body with a long neck and tail, and their limbs were paddle-like.  Fossils have been found in South America and Africa, providing evidence for continental drift. |  The discovery of *Mesosaurus* fossils in both South America and Africa provided crucial evidence supporting the theory of continental drift.  | 近义词:  (no direct synonyms, as it's a taxonomic order) | 反义词: (no direct antonyms)
