词源:
The word "confound" ultimately derives from the Old French word "confondre," which means "to mix together, confuse."  This in turn comes from the Latin "confundere,"  composed of the prefix "con-" (together) and "fundere" (to pour).  The original sense of pouring things together evolved into the modern meaning of mixing up or confusing things, both literally and figuratively.
