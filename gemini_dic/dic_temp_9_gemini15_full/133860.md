nongraphitic: /ˌnɒnɡræˈfɪtɪk/ | adj. |非石墨的，无石墨的 | Not possessing the crystalline structure of graphite; referring to materials lacking the layered structure and properties characteristic of graphite.  Such materials may be amorphous carbon or have other structural arrangements. |  例句：The nongraphitic carbon showed different electrochemical properties compared to graphite.  非石墨碳显示出与石墨不同的电化学性质。


The analysis revealed a significant amount of nongraphitic carbon in the sample. 分析显示样品中含有大量的非石墨碳。


近义词：amorphous, non-crystalline | 反义词：graphitic, crystalline

USAGE->
(由于nongraphitic是一个形容词，它本身不构成谓语，因此无法按动词的时态进行例句展示。以下例句展示了其在不同句法结构中的用法。)

肯定句:
The material is nongraphitic in nature. =这种材料本质上是非石墨的。
The resulting carbon was largely nongraphitic. =生成的碳大部分是非石墨的。


否定句:
The carbon is not nongraphitic; it exhibits a clear graphite structure. = 碳不是非石墨的；它呈现出清晰的石墨结构。
The sample was determined to be not entirely nongraphitic. = 样本被确定并非完全是非石墨的。


疑问句:
Is the carbon deposit nongraphitic? = 碳沉积物是非石墨的吗？
Are these particles nongraphitic in origin? = 这些颗粒的起源是非石墨的吗？


比较句:
Nongraphitic carbon is less conductive than graphitic carbon. = 非石墨碳的导电性低于石墨碳。
The properties of nongraphitic carbon differ substantially from those of crystalline graphite. = 非石墨碳的性质与结晶石墨的性质大相径庭。


PHRASE->
(由于nongraphitic本身就是一个完整的形容词，它不与其他词组成固定词组，以下列出一些常见的搭配)


nongraphitic carbon: 非石墨碳
nongraphitic materials: 非石墨材料
highly nongraphitic: 高度非石墨的
partially nongraphitic: 部分非石墨的
degree of nongraphiticity: 非石墨化程度


词源:
The word "nongraphitic" is derived from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "graphitic," which itself is derived from "graphite."  Graphite comes from the Greek word "graphein," meaning "to write," reflecting its historical use in pencils.
