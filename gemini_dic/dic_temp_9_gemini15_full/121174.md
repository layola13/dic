The word "misdight" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information according to the requested format.  It may be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure dialect.
