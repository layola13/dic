longingness's:/ˈlɒŋɪŋnəsɪz/ | n. |渴望的状态（复数）|The word "longingness's" is not a standard English word.  It's an unusual and arguably incorrect formation.  It appears to be an attempt to pluralize the already somewhat unusual noun "longingness," which itself is a noun formed from the adjective "longing" by adding the suffix "-ness." The correct way to express the plural would simply be "longingnesses."  The apostrophe-s ('s) is typically used to show possession, not plurality for regular nouns. |例句：There is no standard usage for "longingness's" as it's grammatically incorrect.  A correct sentence using the related word would be: "Her longingnesses for her homeland were palpable." = 她对家乡的渴望是显而易见的。|近义词:yearnings (plural), desires (plural), aspirations (plural)|反义词:contentment, satisfaction, indifference|名词
