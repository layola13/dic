USAGE->
This word is extremely rare and doesn't lend itself to typical grammatical tense variations like the examples provided for "what".  Sentences using "intervital" would be highly context-specific and usually within a scientific or philosophical discussion.  Therefore, providing examples for all tenses would be artificial and unhelpful.


PHRASE->
There are no common or established phrases using "intervital".  The word itself is so uncommon that phraseology around it is nonexistent.
