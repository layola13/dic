emulsifications:/ɪˌmʌlsɪfɪˈkeɪʃənz/| n. |乳化作用，乳化过程 |The process of mixing two or more immiscible liquids (like oil and water) to form a stable emulsion.  This is achieved using an emulsifier, which reduces the interfacial tension between the liquids. |Example: The emulsifications of oil and vinegar are crucial for making mayonnaise.  乳化油和醋对于制作蛋黄酱至关重要。

The process of homogenizing milk creates a stable emulsion, preventing the separation of fat. 均质化牛奶的过程会产生稳定的乳状液，防止脂肪分离。|近义词：emulsification (singular), homogenization |反义词：separation, stratification
