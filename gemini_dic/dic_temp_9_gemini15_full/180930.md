词源:
The word "reignitions" is derived from the verb "reignite," which combines the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") with the verb "ignite" (meaning "to set on fire").  "Ignite" itself comes from the Latin word "ignis," meaning "fire." Therefore, "reignitions" literally means "the acts of setting on fire again."
