词源:
The word "hominess" is derived from the word "home," ultimately from the Old English word "hām," meaning "village," "estate," or "dwelling place."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, "hominess" describes the quality of being homelike or having a comfortable and cozy atmosphere.
