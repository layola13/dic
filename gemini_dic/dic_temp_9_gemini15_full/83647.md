词源:
The word "haemophiliac" is derived from "haemophilia" + "-iac," a suffix indicating a person afflicted with a particular condition.  "Haemophilia" itself comes from the Greek words "haima" (αἷμα), meaning "blood," and "philia" (φιλία), meaning "love" or "fondness,"  referring to the excessive tendency to bleed.  The "-iac" suffix is of Greek origin as well,  used to form nouns denoting a person suffering from a particular disease or condition.
