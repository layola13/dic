sextoness:/ˈsɛkstənɪs/| n.| 萨克逊人的女性 | The word "sextoness" is a relatively rare and archaic term referring to a female sexton.  A sexton is a person employed to maintain a church and churchyard, often including tasks like ringing the bells, cleaning, and preparing the church for services.  Therefore, a sextoness would be a woman who performs these duties.  Its usage is largely limited to historical contexts or situations where gender-specific language is employed. |The old church employed a sextoness who was known for her meticulous care of the building. = 老教堂雇用了一位以细致呵护教堂建筑而闻名的女管理员。 The sextoness diligently polished the brasses and kept the flowers fresh. = 女管理员勤勉地擦拭黄铜器并保持鲜花新鲜。|近义词:female sexton, church caretaker (female)|反义词:None specifically, but could be contrasted with male sexton.


词源:
The word is a combination of "sexton" and the suffix "-ess," which is a feminine suffix added to nouns to indicate the female form. "Sexton" itself derives from Old French *sexton, ultimately from Latin *sacrista (sacrist).  The Latin term referred to a person in charge of the sacred objects in a church.
