词源:

The word "portentously" derives from the adjective "portentous," which in turn comes from the Late Latin word "portentosus," meaning "full of portents" or "ominous."  A "portent" is a sign or warning that something, especially something momentous or calamitous, is likely to happen.  The ultimate root lies in the Latin verb "portendere," meaning "to portend," "to foretell," or "to be a sign of."
