proembryo:/ˈproʊɛmbrɪoʊ/| n. |原胚,前胚|A proembryo is the earliest stage of an embryo's development, preceding the formation of distinct embryonic structures.  It is a mass of cells resulting from fertilization, but it has not yet differentiated into the recognizable parts of an embryo.  The exact definition can vary slightly depending on the organism. |Example: The proembryo develops into a mature embryo after several stages of cell division and differentiation.  原胚在经过几个阶段的细胞分裂和分化后发育成为成熟的胚胎。|近义词: zygote (in some contexts), early embryo |反义词: mature embryo


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The proembryo develops rapidly. = 原胚发育迅速。
This plant's proembryo shows signs of differentiation. =  这种植物的原胚显示出分化的迹象。


一般过去时:
The researcher observed the proembryo under a microscope. = 研究人员在显微镜下观察了原胚。
The proembryo had already begun to divide. = 原胚已经开始分裂。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied proembryo development extensively. = 科学家们已经广泛研究了原胚发育。
The proembryo has not yet formed distinct tissues. = 原胚尚未形成明显的组织。


过去完成时:
The cells had already fused to form the proembryo before the observation. = 在观察之前，细胞已经融合形成原胚。
The experiment had shown that the proembryo was sensitive to temperature changes. = 实验表明原胚对温度变化敏感。


将来时:
The proembryo will develop into a seedling. = 原胚将发育成为幼苗。
Researchers will further investigate the proembryo's gene expression. = 研究人员将进一步研究原胚的基因表达。


虚拟语气:
If the proembryo were damaged, development would be impaired. = 如果原胚受损，发育就会受损。
It would be helpful if we had more information about the proembryo's structure. = 如果我们有更多关于原胚结构的信息，那将会有帮助。


被动语态:
The proembryo was carefully examined. = 原胚被仔细检查。
The proembryo's development is influenced by environmental factors. = 原胚的发育受环境因素的影响。


疑问句:
What stage of development is this proembryo in? = 这个原胚处于哪个发育阶段？
How does the proembryo's size change over time? = 原胚的大小随时间如何变化？


否定句:
The proembryo did not show any signs of abnormality. = 原胚没有显示任何异常迹象。
The proembryo was not yet visible under low magnification. = 在低倍率下，原胚还不可见。


PHRASE->

proembryo development = 原胚发育
proembryo culture = 原胚培养
proembryo stage = 原胚阶段
proembryo morphology = 原胚形态
study of proembryo = 原胚的研究
