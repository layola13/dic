monociliated:/ˌmɒnəʊˈsɪlieɪtɪd/| adj. |单纤毛的|Having only one cilium.  This term is typically used in biology to describe cells or organisms possessing a single cilium.  The cilium plays a vital role in cell motility, sensory perception, and fluid movement.|例句：The monociliated cells in the respiratory tract help to clear mucus.  呼吸道中的单纤毛细胞有助于清除粘液。

The olfactory neurons are monociliated sensory neurons.嗅觉神经元是单纤毛感觉神经元。|近义词：uniciliate |反义词：multicilliated
