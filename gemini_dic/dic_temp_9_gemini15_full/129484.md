The word "non-analogous" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "analogous," which means "showing an analogy or similarity."  Therefore, "non-analogous" means lacking analogy or similarity. Its etymology traces back to the Greek words "ana-" (up, upon) and "logos" (word, reason, ratio), reflecting the original sense of a proportional relationship or similarity between things. The prefix "non-" is of Latin origin.
