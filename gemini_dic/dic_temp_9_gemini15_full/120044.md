The word "millistere" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis according to the specified format.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a technical term from a very specialized field, or a word from a constructed language.  More context is needed to understand its potential meaning.
