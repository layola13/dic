hyperconjugated: /ˌhaɪpərˈkɒndʒʊɡeɪtɪd/ | adj. | 超共轭的 |

英文解析:Describes a phenomenon in chemistry where the interaction of electrons in a sigma bond with an adjacent empty or partially filled p or π orbital results in increased stability of the molecule.  This interaction extends beyond the typical conjugation found in pi systems.  It involves the delocalization of electron density from sigma bonds (typically C-H or C-C) into an adjacent empty or partially filled p orbital.  This stabilization effect can influence molecular properties such as bond lengths, reactivity, and spectroscopic characteristics.

例句:

Hyperconjugation stabilizes carbocations by donating electron density from adjacent C-H bonds. = 超共轭通过从相邻的C-H键提供电子密度来稳定碳正离子。

The increased stability of the molecule due to hyperconjugation is evident in its higher boiling point. = 分子由于超共轭而增加的稳定性在其较高的沸点中显而易见。


近义词:  (There isn't a direct synonym, as hyperconjugation is a specific chemical phenomenon.)  Resonance (but resonance is a broader term and involves pi electrons primarily)

反义词: (There isn't a direct antonym, the absence of hyperconjugation would simply mean less stabilization.)  Localized (referring to electron density)
