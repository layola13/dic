The word "resees" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "reese's" (referring to Reese's Peanut Butter Cups), "recess," "resee" (though "resee" itself isn't a common word), or a similar word?

2. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (a name of a person, place, or thing) specific to a certain context.  If you provide the context where you encountered this word, I might be able to help.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word or slang term not yet widely recognized.  Again, context is crucial.

4. **It's a typographical error:** A simple typo in a larger text.


Without more information, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format. Please provide the context or intended spelling.
