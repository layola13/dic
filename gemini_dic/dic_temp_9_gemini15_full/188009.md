WORD ORIGIN->
The word "rough-hewn" is a compound adjective formed from "rough," meaning uneven or unpolished, and "hewn," the past participle of the verb "hew," meaning to chop or cut with an axe or other tool.  The origin of "rough" traces back to Old English "hrūh," while "hew" comes from Old English "heawan."  Thus, "rough-hewn" literally means "roughly chopped or cut."
