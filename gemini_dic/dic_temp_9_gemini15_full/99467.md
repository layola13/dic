"Interfascicular connective tissue" (束间结缔组织)
"Interfascicular blood vessels" (束间血管)
"Interfascicular nerve fibers" (束间神经纤维)
"Increased interfascicular spacing" (束间间距增加)

WORD ORIGIN->
* **inter-**:  Latin prefix meaning "between," "among," or "amongst."
* **fascicul-**: From Latin "fasciculus," a diminutive of "fascis," meaning "bundle."
* **-ar**:  Latin suffix forming adjectives.

Therefore, "interfascicular" literally means "between bundles" or "between fascicles."
