词源:
The word "coordinator" comes from the verb "coordinate," which itself is derived from the Latin words "co-" (meaning "together") and "ordinare" (meaning "to arrange" or "to order").  Therefore, the core meaning of "coordinator" relates to the act of bringing things together in an organized manner.
