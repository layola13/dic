WORD ORIGIN->

The word "overopinionatedness" is formed by combining several elements:

* **over-**:  A prefix indicating excess or to a greater extent than is necessary or desirable.
* **opinionated**:  An adjective describing someone who is stubbornly adhering to their own opinions.  It comes from "opinion" + "-ated" (a suffix indicating having a particular quality).
* **-ness**: A suffix that turns an adjective into a noun, indicating a state, quality, or condition.


Therefore, "overopinionatedness" literally means "the state of being excessively opinionated."
