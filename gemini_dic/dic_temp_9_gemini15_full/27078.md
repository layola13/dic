词源:
The word "calibrate" comes from the Medieval Latin word "calibrare," meaning "to determine the caliber of (a cannon)," which in turn is derived from the Arabic word "qālib," meaning "mold" or "form."  The original meaning related to the standardization of the bore (diameter) of a cannon, which directly relates to the accuracy and consistency of the weapon's performance.  Over time, the meaning broadened to include the adjustment of any instrument to a standard or specified measure.
