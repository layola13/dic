词源:
The word "rooking" is derived from the word "rook," which originally referred to a type of bird and later became associated with a chess piece.  The sense of "cheating" likely developed from the idea of a rook (chess piece) being used deceptively in a game.  The modern usage as a noun meaning "beginner" is a more recent development, possibly due to the association of inexperienced players with being easily "rooked" or cheated.
