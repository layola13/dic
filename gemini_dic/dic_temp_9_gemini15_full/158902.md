词源:
The word "plunge" originates from the Old French word "plonger," meaning "to dive" or "to immerse."  This, in turn, has roots in the Latin word "plumbare," meaning "to sound (the depth of water) with a plumb line."  The original sense of measuring depth has evolved to encompass the act of diving or falling rapidly.
