The word "gishes" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a proper noun (like a name or place), or a word specific to a particular dialect or field.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide the requested information, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered "gishes".
