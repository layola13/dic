clinodome:/ˈklaɪnədoʊm/| n. |斜穹顶，倾斜屋顶|A clinodome is a crystal face that is inclined to all three crystallographic axes.  It's a type of crystallographic form found in various crystal systems.  The term is used primarily in crystallography and mineralogy.|例句：The mineral exhibited a prominent clinodome face, clearly visible under the microscope.  这种矿物呈现出明显的斜穹顶面，在显微镜下清晰可见。


The analysis of the crystal structure revealed several well-defined clinodomes. 晶体结构分析揭示了几个定义明确的斜穹顶。|近义词：斜面(oblique face) (in a broader sense)|反义词：正交面(orthogonal face) (in a broader sense)|名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used within the specialized context of crystallography and mineralogy.  Therefore, grammatical examples demonstrating tenses, voice, etc., are not applicable in the same way as for a common word like "what".  Instead, usage examples will focus on its application in descriptive mineralogy and crystallography.


Example 1 (Descriptive):
The crystal displayed a series of well-developed clinodomes, indicating a specific crystallographic symmetry. 该晶体显示出一系列发育良好的斜穹顶，表明其具有特定的晶体学对称性。

Example 2 (Analytical):
Careful measurement of the clinodome angles allowed for accurate determination of the unit cell parameters. 仔细测量斜穹顶的角度可以精确确定晶胞参数。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "clinodome".  The term is highly technical and limited to scientific contexts.
