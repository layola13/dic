词源:

Friability is derived from the Latin word *friabilis*, meaning "easily crumbled."  The suffix *-ity* is a common English suffix used to form nouns denoting a quality or state.  Thus, friability denotes the *state* of being easily crumbled.

用法说明:

Friability is primarily used in scientific and technical contexts, particularly in fields like geology, materials science, and pharmacy.  It describes the ease with which a solid material can be broken down into smaller pieces.  The opposite of friability is toughness or durability.  The degree of friability can be influenced by factors such as moisture content, particle size, and the material's internal structure.
