hypallelomorph:/ˌhaɪpælˈɛləmɔːrf/ | n. | 并列异形词 | A word or phrase that is formed by combining elements from different words or phrases, resulting in a new word or phrase with a similar meaning but a different form.  It often involves a combination of morphemes from different words to create a new word with a parallel or analogous structure.  The term is primarily used in linguistics and morphology.  There are no widely accepted common examples as the term itself is quite specialized.  The formation process is more of a theoretical concept than a frequently observed phenomenon. |  There is no readily available example sentence in common usage due to the highly specialized nature of the term.  The concept is better illustrated through theoretical linguistic examples rather than real-world sentences. For example, consider a hypothetical scenario where "bio" (from biology) and "techno" (from technology) combine to create "biotechno," representing a parallel structure to other combined terms like "geotechno". | 近义词:  (No direct synonyms, as the term describes a process rather than a specific word) | 反义词: (No direct antonyms) | n.
