词源:  The word "metaphrastical" derives from the Greek words "meta-" (meaning "beyond," "after," or "change") and "phrasis" (meaning "phrase" or "expression").  The term "metaphrase" itself emerged in classical rhetoric to describe a type of translation that prioritized literal rendering over stylistic adaptation.
