注意事项:

The word "Jew" can be offensive depending on context and the speaker's intent.  It's generally preferred to use "Jewish person" or "Jewish people" as more respectful and inclusive alternatives.  The historical use of the word "Jew" has been associated with discrimination and prejudice.  Therefore, careful consideration of context and audience is crucial when using this word.
