词源:
The word "conjure" comes from the Old French word "conjurer," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "coniurare," meaning "to swear together," or "to conspire."  This original meaning relates to the idea of using incantations or oaths to bind spirits or influence events. Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the magical creation or evocation of things.
