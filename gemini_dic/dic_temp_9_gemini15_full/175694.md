/ræpfʊli/ | adv. | 狂喜地，欣喜若狂地 |  The word "rapfully" is not a standard English word. It's likely a neologism or a misspelling.  It seems to be intended to convey a feeling of intense joy or excitement, perhaps combining aspects of "rapturous" and "rapid." However, its lack of established usage means there's no standard definition or example sentences.  It's best avoided in formal writing. |  No example sentences exist as it's not a recognized word. | 近义词: rapturously, ecstatically, joyfully | 反义词: sadly, sorrowfully, dejectedly | adv.
