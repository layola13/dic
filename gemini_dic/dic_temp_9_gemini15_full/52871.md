词源:

diminishing comes from the verb "diminish," which originates from Old French *demenui(ssir) and ultimately from Latin *deminuere.  *deminuere is a compound of *de- (down, away) and *minuere (to lessen).  The "-ing" suffix transforms the verb into a present participle, functioning as an adjective in this case.
