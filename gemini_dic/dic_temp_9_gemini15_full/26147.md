词源:
The word "busty" derives from "bust," meaning "the chest or upper body of a person."  This "bust" itself originates from the Middle English word "bust," ultimately connected to the Old French "buste" and the Latin "bustum" (a tomb or monument).  The "-y" suffix adds an intensifying or descriptive quality, indicating abundance or fullness.  The evolution reflects a shift from a neutral anatomical term to one with more suggestive connotations over time.
