The word "doughtiness" derives from the Old English word "dūhtig," meaning "brave," "valiant," or "strong."  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix that forms nouns of quality or state.  Therefore, "doughtiness" literally means "the state or quality of being doughty."  The possessive "doughtiness's" simply adds possessive case to the noun.
