nyctitropic:/ˌnɪkˈtɪtrəpɪk/| adj.| 向光性的（指夜间）；夜间向光性的 | Relating to or exhibiting nyctitropism, the movement of plants in response to darkness.  Nyctitropic movements are often a diurnal rhythm, occurring daily regardless of light conditions.  This is distinct from phototropism which refers to plant responses to light itself. | Example: The leaves of some plants exhibit nyctitropic movements, folding up at night and opening during the day.  某些植物的叶子表现出夜向性运动，晚上卷起来，白天张开。| 近义词：sleep-movement, nocturnal | 反义词：phototropic


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The plant exhibits nyctitropic movements. = 植物表现出夜向性运动。
Nyctitropic responses vary between species. = 不同物种的夜向性反应各不相同。


一般过去时:
The leaves displayed nyctitropic behavior last night. = 昨晚叶子表现出夜向性行为。
Researchers observed nyctitropic movement in the experiment. = 研究人员在实验中观察到夜向性运动。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied nyctitropic responses for decades. = 科学家们已经研究夜向性反应几十年了。
The plant has shown consistent nyctitropic patterns. = 这株植物表现出一致的夜向性模式。


过去完成时:
The leaves had already folded before sunset. = 日落之前叶子已经卷起来了。
The researchers had completed their study of nyctitropic behavior. = 研究人员已经完成了他们对夜向性行为的研究。


将来时:
The plant will likely exhibit nyctitropic movement tonight. = 这株植物今晚可能会表现出夜向性运动。
We will observe the nyctitropic response under controlled conditions. = 我们将在受控条件下观察夜向性反应。


虚拟语气:
If the plant were to lack nyctitropism, its leaves would remain open at night. = 如果植物缺乏夜向性，它的叶子会在晚上保持张开。
I wish I understood the mechanisms behind nyctitropic movements better. = 我希望我更好地理解夜向性运动背后的机制。


被动语态:
Nyctitropic movements are often influenced by circadian rhythms. = 夜向性运动经常受到昼夜节律的影响。
The nyctitropic response was carefully documented by the researchers. = 研究人员仔细记录了夜向性反应。


疑问句:
Does this plant show nyctitropic movements? = 这株植物表现出夜向性运动吗？
What factors influence nyctitropic responses? = 哪些因素会影响夜向性反应？


否定句:
This species does not exhibit pronounced nyctitropic behavior. = 这个物种没有表现出明显的夜向性行为。
The experiment did not reveal any significant nyctitropic response. = 实验没有发现任何明显的夜向性反应。
