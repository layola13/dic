self-lubrication: /ˌsɛlfˌluːbrɪˈkeɪʃən/ | n. | 自润滑 | The ability of a machine or system to lubricate itself without external assistance.  This often involves the use of materials that inherently possess lubricating properties or designs that facilitate internal lubrication.  | Example: The bearings in this motor utilize self-lubrication, requiring less maintenance.  这个马达的轴承采用自润滑，需要较少的维护。 | 近义词: automatic lubrication, self-oiling | 反义词:  external lubrication, requiring lubrication
