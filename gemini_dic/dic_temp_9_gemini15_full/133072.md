The word "nonequations" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a neologism, possibly a combination of "none" and "equations,"  created to describe a situation or concept lacking equations.  Therefore, a traditional word analysis like the one requested for "what" is not possible.  It would require context to understand its intended meaning.

To provide a helpful response, let's assume "nonequations" is meant to refer to a situation where there are no mathematical equations, or a system or concept lacking mathematical formulations.


If we were to *invent* a word entry for this non-existent word,  it might look like this (based on its hypothetical meaning):


nonequations: /ˌnʌnɪˈkweɪʒənz/ | n. | 非方程式；无方程式的系统 | A situation or system lacking mathematical equations or formulas; a descriptive, rather than quantitative, approach. | Example:  The social sciences often rely on nonequations, focusing on qualitative analysis instead of mathematical modeling.  社会科学通常依赖于非方程式，专注于定性分析而不是数学建模。|近义词: qualitative descriptions, non-mathematical models | 反义词: equations, mathematical models, quantitative analysis | noun


USAGE->  (Illustrative examples based on the invented meaning)


General Usage:
The research relied heavily on nonequations, using interviews and case studies to understand the phenomenon.  这项研究很大程度上依赖于非方程式，使用访谈和案例研究来了解这种现象。

The artist's work is characterized by nonequations; it's more about feeling than precise measurement.  这位艺术家的作品以非方程式为特征；它更关乎感觉而不是精确的测量。


There are no further grammatical usages (tenses, moods, etc.) applicable because "nonequations" is a noun.  There is no verb form.  Phrase examples would also depend entirely on the context in which the word is used (and since it is not a real word, phrasing examples are speculative).
