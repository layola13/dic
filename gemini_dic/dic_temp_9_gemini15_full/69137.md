favosite:/ˈfævəsaɪt/| n. |蜂巢状灰岩|A type of fossil coral, characterized by a honeycomb-like structure.  It's a sedimentary rock composed of the skeletons of colonial corals.  These corals lived in shallow marine environments during the Paleozoic Era. The honeycomb structure is formed by the tightly packed, polygonal corallites (individual coral skeletons) which are visible on the surface of the rock.|The favosite fossil I found was remarkably well-preserved.|近义词：honeycomb coral,  |反义词:无|名词
