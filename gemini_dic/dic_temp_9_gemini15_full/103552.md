词源:

The word "jogtrotter" is a relatively recent coinage, formed by combining "jog" and "trotter."  "Jog" as a verb meaning to run at a slow pace comes from the Old Norse word "joga" meaning to shake or jolt. "Trotter" is from the Old French "trotter" meaning to run quickly or to trot. The combination creates a neologism emphasizing a slow but steady running pace.
