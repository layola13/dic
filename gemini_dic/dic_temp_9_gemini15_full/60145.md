词源:
The word "effectuate" comes from the Late Latin word "effectuare," which is a combination of "effectus" (past participle of "efficere," meaning "to bring about" or "to accomplish") and the suffix "-ate," which indicates "to make" or "to cause to be."  Therefore, the word's root implies the act of making something effective or causing something to happen.
