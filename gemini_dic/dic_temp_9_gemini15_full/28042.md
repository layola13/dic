词源:
The word "caparisoned" is derived from the noun "caparison," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "capadison," meaning "horse cloth," or "covering for a horse."  This Old French word itself has roots in the Medieval Latin "cappare," meaning "to cut" or "to shear" (referring to the cutting of cloth for the horse covering), possibly with influence from Arabic sources.
