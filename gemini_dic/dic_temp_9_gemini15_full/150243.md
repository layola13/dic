词源:

The word "panderingly" derives from the verb "to pander," which ultimately traces back to the Greek word "pandēros," referring to a pimp or procurer.  Over time, the meaning shifted to encompass any act of gratifying another's desires, especially in a base or servile manner. The "-ingly" suffix transforms the verb into an adverb, modifying the action described.
