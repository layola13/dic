The word "flimflammer" is a compound word.  "Flimflam" itself is of uncertain origin, but it's likely onomatopoeic, suggesting the sound or swiftness of a deceptive act.  The "-er" suffix is a common agentive suffix in English, indicating a person who performs the action.  Therefore, a "flimflammer" is someone who performs the action of "flimflamming," which is to swindle or cheat.  The term's usage reflects its origins in informal speech and has continued in that vein.
