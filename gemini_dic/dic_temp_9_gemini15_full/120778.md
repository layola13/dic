词源:
The word "misapprehension" comes from the prefix "mis-" (wrong, bad) and the word "apprehension," which originally meant "understanding" or "grasping."  Apprehension itself comes from the Latin word "apprehendere," meaning "to seize" or "to grasp." Therefore, misapprehension literally means a "wrong grasping" or "wrong understanding."
