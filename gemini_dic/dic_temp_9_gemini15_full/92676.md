词源:
The term "ice hockey" is a compound word. "Ice" refers to the surface on which the game is played, and "hockey" derives from the French word "hoquet," meaning "shepherd's crook."  The original game, played on grass, used sticks resembling shepherd's crooks. The term evolved as the game transitioned to ice.
