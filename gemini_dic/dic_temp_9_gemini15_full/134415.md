词源:

The word is formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") with "invincibility" (the state of being invincible).  "Invincibility" itself comes from "invincible," which is from the Latin "invincibilis," from "in-" (not) + "vincere" (to conquer).  Therefore, noninvincibility literally means "not the state of being unconquerable."
