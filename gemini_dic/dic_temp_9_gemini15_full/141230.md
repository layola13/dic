ootooid:/ˈoʊtoʊɔɪd/| n. |类卵形体，卵形物|  A hypothetical, ovoid-shaped structure or organism, often used in theoretical biology or paleontology to describe a vaguely defined fossil or body plan. The term lacks precise scientific definition and is generally avoided in formal publications due to its ambiguity.  |Example:  The paleontologist described the newly discovered fossil as an "ootooid," acknowledging the uncertainty of its classification. = 古生物学家将新发现的化石描述为“类卵形体”，承认其分类的不确定性。|近义词: ovoid, ovum (in some contexts),  ellipsoid |反义词:  (no direct antonyms, as it describes a shape, not a quality)|名词
