词源:
The term "cross-channel" is a compound word.  "Cross" indicates the interaction or movement between different entities, and "channel" refers to a specific communication medium (e.g., email, social media, website).  Therefore, "cross-channel" literally means "across different channels."  Its usage in marketing and advertising developed relatively recently with the rise of the internet and the proliferation of digital communication platforms.
