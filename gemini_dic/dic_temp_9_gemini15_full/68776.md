词源:

The word "farseeing" combines "far" (meaning distant or remote in time or space) and "seeing" (meaning perceiving or understanding).  The "far" element indicates a perception extending into the future, while "seeing" represents the act of understanding or anticipating future events.  This combination creates the meaning of having the ability to foresee future events.


用法说明:

farseeing主要用作形容词，修饰人或其计划、策略等。它强调的是一种洞察力和预见未来的能力，而不是简单的预测。
