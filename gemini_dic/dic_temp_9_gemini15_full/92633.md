由于 "ibans" 不是一个标准的英文单词，它很可能是一个缩写或者拼写错误。如果它指的是 "IBANs" (International Bank Account Numbers)，则解析如下：

/ˈaɪbæn/ | n. |国际银行账户号码 | International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs) are internationally standardized bank account numbers. They are used to identify bank accounts across different countries.  An IBAN typically includes country code, check digits, and the account number itself.  This format allows for easier international money transfers. | Example: My IBAN is DE89 3704 0044 0532 0130 00. 我的IBAN是DE89 3704 0044 0532 0130 00. |近义词: bank account number, account details | 反义词: (无直接反义词)
