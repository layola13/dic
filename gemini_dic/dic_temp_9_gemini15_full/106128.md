The word "knite" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  The intended word might be "knight" (a title of honor) or "knit" (to make fabric by looping yarn).

2. **It's a dialectal word:** It might be a word used in a specific region or community, but not widely known.

3. **It's a newly coined word or a proper noun:**  It could be a very recent invention or a name.
