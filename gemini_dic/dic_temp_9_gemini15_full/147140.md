词源:
The word "overlooker" is a compound word formed from "overlook" + "-er".  "Overlook" combines the prefix "over-" (meaning "above" or "beyond") with "look," indicating the act of looking over or supervising something. The suffix "-er" denotes a person who performs the action.  Thus, an overlooker is literally someone who looks over something or someone.
