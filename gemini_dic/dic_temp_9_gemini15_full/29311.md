词源:

The word "caster" ultimately derives from the Old French word "chaster," meaning "to cast" or "to throw."  This relates to the act of throwing or scattering seeds (hence the agricultural meaning), and the act of "casting" a voice or message (hence the broadcasting meaning).  The development of the "wheel" meaning likely stems from the imagery of wheels being cast or rolled.
