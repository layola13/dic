词源:
The word "cabbaging" is an informal term, likely deriving from the image of hiding things, like a cabbage, in a concealed place.  The core meaning relates to the secretive nature of the action, similar to how a cabbage might be hidden within a garden. There's no direct etymological link to a specific older word, rather it's a figurative expression that evolved through colloquial usage.
