词源:

The word "enfeeblement" is derived from the verb "enfeeble," which itself comes from the Old French word "enfeblesser," meaning "to weaken."  The prefix "en-" intensifies the meaning, while "-ment" is a suffix forming nouns of action or state.  The ultimate root can be traced back to the Latin "fēbilis," meaning "weak."
