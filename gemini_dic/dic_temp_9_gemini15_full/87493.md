heterocephalous: /ˌhɛtərəˈsɛfələs/ | adj. | 异头部的，头端不对称的 | Having two dissimilar ends or poles; referring to structures with unequal or differently developed ends.  The term is often used in biology and zoology to describe organisms or structures with different ends or poles.  For example, a heterocephalous organism might have a head that is distinctly different from its tail. | The newly discovered species exhibited a heterocephalous morphology, with one end significantly larger and more complex than the other.  | 近义词: asymmetrical, dissimilar, uneven | 反义词: homocephalous, symmetrical

Before the study, it had been assumed the structure was homocephalous. = 在研究之前，人们认为该结构是同头部的。


将来时:
Further research will determine if the new species is heterocephalous. = 进一步的研究将确定新物种是否为异头部的。
