词源:
Condemnable comes from the verb "condemn," which comes from the Old French "condamner" and ultimately from the Latin "condemnare," meaning "to sentence, to pronounce judgment against."  The suffix "-able" indicates something capable of being done or worthy of a particular action.  Therefore, condemnable means "capable of being condemned."
