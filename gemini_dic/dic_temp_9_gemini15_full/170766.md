pseudocoelia:/ˌsuːdoʊˈsiːliə/| n. |假体腔|A pseudocoelom (also called a pseudocoel) is a body cavity that is not completely lined by mesoderm.  Unlike a true coelom (eucoelom), which is completely surrounded by mesodermal tissue, a pseudocoelom is only partially lined by mesoderm.  This means there is a space between the endoderm (inner lining of the gut) and the mesoderm (middle layer) that is not completely enclosed by mesodermal tissue.  Animals with pseudocoels are called pseudocoelomates.|Example:  Roundworms (nematodes) are a well-known example of organisms with a pseudocoelom. Their pseudocoelom acts as a hydrostatic skeleton, providing support and aiding in movement. |近义词:blastocoel (in early development)|反义词:eucoelom|
