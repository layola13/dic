词源:

* **mis-**:  A prefix meaning "wrongly," "badly," or "ill."
* **interpret-**: From Latin *interpretari* "to explain, translate, understand," from *inter-* "between" + *precari* "to pray, ask."  This reflects the original sense of interpreting as mediating between parties or ideas.
* **-able**: A suffix meaning "capable of being," "worthy of," or "suitable for."

因此，misinterpretable 的字面意思是“能够被错误解释的”。
