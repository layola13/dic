词源：
The word "reckoning" comes from the Old English word "reccan," meaning "to care for," "to think," or "to calculate."  The addition of "with" indicates the direct engagement with a particular issue or entity.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the idea of settling accounts, dealing with consequences, and confronting difficulties.
