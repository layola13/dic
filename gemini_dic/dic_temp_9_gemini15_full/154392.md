permeance:/ˈpɜːrmiəns/| n. |磁导率，渗透性|The ease with which magnetic flux can pass through a material.  It is the reciprocal of reluctance.  In other contexts, it can refer to the ease with which a substance allows another to pass through. |例句：The high permeance of the core allowed for efficient energy transfer.  高磁导率的核心允许高效的能量传输。|例句：The material's permeance to water was tested under various conditions. 该材料的透水性在各种条件下进行了测试。|近义词：conductivity, permeability|反义词：reluctance, impermeability
