USAGE->

This word doesn't have verb, adjective or other forms, as it's a noun referring to a specific area of linguistic study.  Therefore, the typical grammatical usages don't apply.  Instead, let's show examples of how it's used in sentences:


Example 1:
The professor's lecture today was strictly on nonpragmatics, focusing solely on sentence structure and meaning, ignoring real-world context. = 今天的教授讲座严格限于非语用学，只关注句子结构和含义，忽略了现实世界的语境。

Example 4:
The difference between pragmatics and nonpragmatics is often a matter of focus and methodology. = 语用学和非语用学之间的区别往往是关注点和方法论的问题。

Example 5:
Many linguists believe that a complete understanding of language requires integrating both pragmatic and nonpragmatic approaches. = 许多语言学家认为，要完全理解语言，就需要整合语用学和非语用学的方法。


PHRASE->

Nonpragmatics is a field of study, not a phrase itself. It doesn't have common phrases associated with it in the same way that, say, "what" does.  Therefore, no phrase examples are applicable.
