This word is not a standard dictionary entry. It's a newly coined word formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") and "neutralities" (the plural of neutrality).  Therefore, a detailed etymology in the traditional sense is not applicable. However, we can analyze its components:

* **non-:**  A prefix meaning "not," "opposite of," or "lack of."  Its origin is from Old English *ne, *not*.

* **neutrality:** This noun refers to the state of not supporting or helping either side in a conflict, disagreement, etc.; impartiality.  It comes from the Latin *neutralis*, meaning "neither," itself derived from *neuter* ("neither").


The word "nonneutralities" therefore signifies the absence or opposite of neutrality;  it implies the presence of bias, prejudice, or partiality.  It suggests systemic or inherent imbalances, rather than simply isolated instances of unfairness.

Because this is a newly constructed term, usage examples are limited and would need to be contextualized.  The example sentence provided above illustrates a common potential application.


The grammatical properties would follow standard plural noun rules:

* **Plural:** nonneutralities
* **Possessive:** nonneutralities'


There is no verb form directly derived from this noun.  To express actions related to nonneutrality, you would use verbs like: *exhibit nonneutrality*, *demonstrate nonneutrality*, *address nonneutrality*, *eliminate nonneutrality*.


There are no standard phrases directly using "nonneutralities."  Phrases would have to be context-dependent and would likely incorporate the word within a larger descriptive phrase.  For example: "instances of nonneutrality", "concerns about nonneutrality", "analysis of nonneutralities".
