词源:

The word "pregnancy" comes from the Old French word "pregnance," which in turn derives from the Latin word "praegnans," meaning "pregnant."  "Praegnans" is formed from the prefix "prae-" (meaning "before" or "forward") and the verb "gignere" (meaning "to beget" or "to bear").  Therefore, the word's root suggests the state of carrying a child before birth.
