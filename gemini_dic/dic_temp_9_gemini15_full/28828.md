carp-entered:  /kɑːrpˈɛntəd/ | adj. |  用木头建造的；木制的 |  Made or constructed of wood, especially in a skillful or elaborate manner.  This word is not a standard English word and appears to be a blend of "carpenter" and a suffix "-ed," suggesting something made by a carpenter or having the characteristics of carpentry. It lacks established dictionary entries. | Example: The child built a small, intricately carp-entered house.  孩子搭建了一个精致的木制小房子。(This sentence uses the word in a context implying its invented meaning.)| 近义词: wooden, timbered | 反义词:  non-wooden, metal, plastic |  adj.
