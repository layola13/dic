词源:
The word "demeritorious" comes from the Latin word "demereri," meaning "to deserve badly" or "to be deserving of punishment."  The prefix "de-" indicates negation or deprivation, while "-itorious" is a suffix denoting "worthy of" or "characterized by."  Therefore, demeritorious literally means "not deserving of merit" or "deserving of demerit."
