词源:

The word "shortening" comes from the verb "shorten," which is formed from the Old English word "scortian," meaning "to cut short."  The "-ing" suffix denotes the act or process of doing something.  The use of "shortening" to refer to a type of fat is a later development, likely related to its ability to make baked goods tender and thus, in a sense, "shorten" the texture.
