词源:

The word "dilettante" comes from the Italian word "dilettare," meaning "to delight" or "to please."  It originally referred to someone who pursued an activity for pleasure rather than profit or expertise. Over time, it acquired its current, somewhat negative connotation, suggesting superficiality and lack of serious commitment.
