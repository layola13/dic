/ɪˈfɛktʃuəlˌnɛsɪz/ | n. |效力；效能 | The effectualnesses of the new drug are being studied. 新药的疗效正在研究中。 | effectiveness, potency, efficacy | ineffectiveness, inefficacy | 名词


The word "effectualnesses" is a relatively uncommon word, being the plural of "effectualness," which itself is less frequent than "effectiveness."  Both refer to the state or quality of being effectual, meaning producing the intended result; successful.  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "effectual" into a noun.

**Etymology:**

* **effectual:**  From Middle English *effectuel*, from Old French *effectuel*, from Latin *effectuālis*, from *effectus* (past participle of *efficere* "to effect, accomplish"), from *ex-* "out" + *facere* "to make, do."

* **-ness:**  A common English suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.

**Usage:**

While grammatically correct, using "effectualnesses" is generally avoided in favor of the simpler and more common "effectivenesses" or even just "effectiveness" in most contexts. The plural form is only necessary when referring to multiple instances of effectiveness, each distinct from the other. For example, multiple different medications might each have their own distinct "effectualnesses".

**Example Sentences:**

* The different approaches to the problem showed varying degrees of effectualnesses.  不同的方法对这个问题的解决效果各不相同。
*  The study compared the effectualnesses of two different teaching methods. 这项研究比较了两种不同教学方法的有效性。


**Synonyms:**

* Effectivenesses
* Potencies
* Efficacies
* Capabilities
* Potentials


**Antonyms:**

* Ineffectivenesses
* Inefficacies
* Inefficiencies
* Uselessnesses
* Impotencies


There is no specific need to demonstrate grammatical tenses, voice, or moods for this noun as the word itself does not conjugate.  The grammatical context will be dependent on the sentence in which "effectualnesses" is used.  For example, if discussing the outcome of multiple experiments, one might say: "The effectualnesses *were* documented in the report".  Here, the plural noun "effectualnesses" agrees with the past tense verb "were".
