It is a result of the process of elimination, often used in algebra and other branches of mathematics.  For example, in solving a system of linear equations, the eliminant might be a single equation in one variable, obtained by eliminating the other variables. | The eliminant of these two equations is x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.  这个两个方程的消元结果是 x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0。 |resultant, resolvent|  (无明确反义词，可根据语境使用“original equation”等)|名词


USAGE->
(由于eliminant本身为名词，不适用动词时态变化)

PHRASE->
(由于eliminant为专业术语，常用搭配较少)
eliminant of equations: 方程的消元式
compute the eliminant: 计算消元式
the resultant eliminant: 最终的消元式
find the eliminant: 求消元式
the value of the eliminant: 消元式的值
