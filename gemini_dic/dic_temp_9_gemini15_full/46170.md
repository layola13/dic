词源:
From Middle English *cynosure, from Old French *cinosire, from Medieval Latin *cynosura, from Greek κυνόσουρα (kunosoura), literally "dog's tail," from κύων (kuōn, "dog") + οὐρά (oura, "tail").  The Greek word referred to the constellation Ursa Minor (the Little Bear), whose brightest star, Polaris (the North Star), was used for navigation.
