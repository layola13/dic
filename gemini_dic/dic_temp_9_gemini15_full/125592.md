/ˌmʌltɪˈtjuːdɪnəsnəsɪz/ | n. |众多；大量；无数 | The sheer multitudinousnesses of the stars in the night sky are breathtaking.  | 近义词：multitudes, masses, a profusion of | 反义词：scarcity, fewness, paucity |


英文解析:  This word is a rare and somewhat contrived formation. It's a pluralization of "multitudinousness," which itself is a noun meaning a great number or multitude.  The addition of another "-ness" creates a sense of intensified multitude or the quality of being characterized by numerous things.  It's not a word you'd encounter in everyday conversation but might appear in highly descriptive or literary contexts.


例句:

The multitudinousnesses of the challenges facing the new CEO were staggering.  = 面对新任首席执行官的众多挑战令人震惊。


The artist captured the multitudinousnesses of human emotion in his latest painting. = 艺术家在他的最新绘画作品中捕捉到了人类情感的众多方面。


词源:

The word derives from the Latin "multus" (many) + "tudo" (state or condition) + "-ness" (a suffix forming abstract nouns).  The double "-ness" ending is a highly unusual and somewhat artificial construction, emphasizing the sheer abundance and complexity of the multitude.
