词源:
The word "disembarrassment" is derived from the verb "disembarrass," which itself is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away from" or "removal of") and the verb "embarrass."  The word "embarrass" ultimately comes from the Old French "embarasser," meaning "to hinder" or "to impede."  Therefore, "disembarrassment" signifies the removal of hindrance or impediment, leading to a state of relief.
