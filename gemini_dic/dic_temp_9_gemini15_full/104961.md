The word "kemb" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical information following the requested format.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* **A dialect word:** It might be a word from a specific regional dialect or a very niche slang term.
* **A neologism:** It could be a newly coined word not yet widely used.
* **A word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language without common usage in English.

To help me provide the information you need, please clarify the word or provide more context where you encountered it.
