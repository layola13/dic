词源:
The word "fearmonger" is a compound word formed by combining "fear" and "monger."  "Fear" refers to a feeling of anxiety and apprehension. "Monger" is an Old English word meaning "trader" or "dealer," often used in compounds to denote someone who deals in or promotes something negative (e.g., war-monger, scandal-monger).  Therefore, a fearmonger is someone who trades in or promotes fear.
