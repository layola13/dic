The word "lienet" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please double-check your spelling.
2. **It's a neologism or technical term:**  It might be a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field (e.g., a specialized area of law, finance, or technology). If this is the case, please provide the context in which you encountered the word.
3. **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name or a place name.  Again, context is needed.


To provide the analysis you request, I need the correct word or more information about its usage.
