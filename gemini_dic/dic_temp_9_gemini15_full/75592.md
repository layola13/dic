fuel-rods:/ˈfjuːəlˌrɑːdz/ | n. | 燃料棒 | Long, slender rods containing nuclear fuel, used in nuclear reactors to generate heat.  They are typically made of uranium dioxide pellets encased in a cladding material, usually zirconium alloy. | Example: The reactor core is composed of hundreds of fuel rods. 核反应堆堆芯由数百根燃料棒组成。  The spent fuel rods are highly radioactive and require careful handling.  用过的燃料棒具有很强的放射性，需要小心处理。 | 近义词：fuel elements, reactor fuel | 反义词：无


USAGE->
