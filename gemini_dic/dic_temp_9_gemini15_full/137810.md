nonverminousnesses:/ˌnɒnˈvɜːmɪnəsnəsiz/ | n. |非寄生虫性；无害性 |The word "nonverminousnesses" is extremely rare and largely theoretical. It's formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), the suffix "-ness" (meaning "state or quality of"), and the plural suffix "-es" to the already uncommon word "verminous."  It would describe the state or qualities of being free from vermin or parasitic infestations; the absence of infestations.  The word is so unusual that creating example sentences feels contrived.  It lacks common usage and is unlikely to be encountered in everyday language.  Instead, simpler phrases would be preferred to express similar meanings. |近义词：absence of parasites, freedom from infestation, cleanliness |反义词：infestations, verminousness
