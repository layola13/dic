词源:

The word "circuit-breaker" is a compound word. "Circuit" comes from the Old French "circut," meaning "circle," ultimately from Latin "circus."  "Breaker" comes from Old English "brecan," meaning "to break."  Therefore, a circuit breaker is literally a device that "breaks" an electrical "circuit."
