WORD ORIGIN->
The word is a combination of:

* **over-**:  A prefix indicating excess or to a great extent.
* **objectified**:  The past participle of the verb "objectify," meaning to treat someone or something as a mere object.  "Objectify" itself comes from "object" (a thing) + "-ify" (to make or become).


Therefore, "overobjectified" literally means "excessively made into an object."
