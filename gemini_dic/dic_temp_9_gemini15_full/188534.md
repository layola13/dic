词源:  Derived from the adjective "rugged," which ultimately comes from the Old Norse word "rugga," meaning "to shake" or "to rock." This reflects the original sense of something being uneven or rough.  Over time, the meaning expanded to include strength and resilience, particularly in reference to terrain or physical appearance.
