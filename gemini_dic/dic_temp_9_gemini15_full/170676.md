PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "pseudo-Swedish" as a core component.  The term itself describes a stylistic choice, not a set of phrases.  Instead, examples would be specific instances of invented or misused Swedish words within a fictional context.  For example:  "The characters spoke in a strange pseudo-Swedish dialect," or "The magical incantations were composed of pseudo-Swedish words," or "The tavern's sign boasted a pseudo-Swedish name."
