preconnection: /ˌpriːkəˈnekʃən/ | n. | 预连接，预先连接 | A preconnection is an action taken in advance to establish a connection, often used in the context of networking or database systems to speed up subsequent connections.  It involves setting up a connection before it's actually needed, so that when it is needed, the connection is already established and ready to use. This can significantly reduce latency and improve performance. | Example: The application established a preconnection to the database server to improve response time.  该应用程序与数据库服务器建立了预连接以提高响应时间。 | 近义词：preliminary connection, advance connection | 反义词：disconnection

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The server maintains multiple preconnections to handle incoming requests efficiently. = 服务器维护多个预连接以有效处理传入请求。
This application establishes a preconnection before the user logs in. = 此应用程序在用户登录之前建立预连接。


一般过去时:
The engineer configured the system to create preconnections during startup. = 工程师配置了系统，以便在启动时创建预连接。
The application failed to establish a preconnection, resulting in a slow response. = 应用程序未能建立预连接，导致响应速度缓慢。


现在完成时:
The network has established several preconnections to improve bandwidth. = 网络已建立多个预连接以提高带宽。
The team has completed the implementation of preconnections for faster data access. = 团队已完成预连接的实施，以加快数据访问速度。


过去完成时:
Before the transaction started, the client had already established a preconnection. = 在事务开始之前，客户端已经建立了预连接。
The system had failed to create preconnections, leading to significant delays. = 系统未能创建预连接，导致严重的延迟。


将来时:
The new software will utilize preconnections to enhance performance. = 新软件将利用预连接来提高性能。
The upgrade will enable the system to automatically establish preconnections. = 此升级将使系统能够自动建立预连接。


虚拟语气:
If the system had preconnections, the response time would be much faster. = 如果系统有预连接，响应时间会快得多。
It is recommended that the application establish preconnections for optimal performance. = 建议应用程序建立预连接以获得最佳性能。


被动语态:
Preconnections are established by the client application before the main connection. = 预连接由客户端应用程序在主连接之前建立。
Several preconnections were created to improve the application's responsiveness. = 创建了多个预连接以提高应用程序的响应速度。


疑问句:
Are preconnections enabled in the current configuration? = 当前配置中是否启用了预连接？
How many preconnections does the server currently maintain? = 服务器当前维护多少个预连接？


否定句:
The system does not support preconnections. = 系统不支持预连接。
The application did not create a preconnection, resulting in a delay. = 应用程序没有创建预连接，导致延迟。


PHRASE->
preconnection pool = 预连接池
establish a preconnection = 建立预连接
manage preconnections = 管理预连接
optimize preconnections = 优化预连接
preconnection timeout = 预连接超时
