词源:
The word "impulsively" is derived from the adjective "impulsive," which comes from the Latin word "impulsus," the past participle of "impellere," meaning "to drive or push."  The suffix "-ive" indicates an adjective, and "-ly" transforms it into an adverb.  Therefore, "impulsively" literally means "in a manner of being driven or pushed," reflecting the sudden and often unplanned nature of impulsive actions.
