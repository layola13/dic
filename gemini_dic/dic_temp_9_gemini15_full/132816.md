noneclipsing:/ˌnɒnɪˈklɪpsɪŋ/ | adj. | 非食的，不发生食的 | Not exhibiting an eclipse; referring to binary stars whose orbits are not oriented such that one star passes in front of the other as seen from Earth.  This results in a consistently bright observed light curve. | Example:  The noneclipsing binary star system showed a stable light output over many years.  这个非食双星系统多年来显示出稳定的光输出。|近义词：uneclipsed, unocculted | 反义词： eclipsing


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The binary star system is noneclipsing. = 这个双星系统是非食的。
This observation confirms the star is noneclipsing. = 此次观测证实这颗恒星是非食的。


一般过去时:
Astronomers determined the system was noneclipsing. = 天文学家确定该系统是非食的。
The previous study classified the star as noneclipsing. = 先前的研究将这颗恒星归类为非食的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have confirmed that the binary is noneclipsing. = 科学家已经证实该双星是非食的。
Researchers have observed this noneclipsing system for decades. = 研究人员几十年来一直在观测这个非食系统。


过去完成时:
Before the new data, the system had been considered noneclipsing. = 在新的数据出现之前，该系统曾被认为是非食的。
They had initially believed the binary was noneclipsing, but later observations proved otherwise. = 他们最初认为该双星是非食的，但后来的观测证明并非如此。


将来时:
Future observations will likely confirm it's a noneclipsing binary. = 未来的观测可能会证实它是一个非食双星。
We will determine if the system is truly noneclipsing. = 我们将确定该系统是否真的是非食的。


虚拟语气:
If the system were noneclipsing, the light curve would be constant. = 如果该系统是非食的，那么光变曲线将是恒定的。
I wish we had known the star was noneclipsing earlier. = 我希望我们早点知道这颗恒星是非食的。


被动语态:
The star was classified as noneclipsing by the researchers. = 这颗恒星被研究人员归类为非食的。
The noneclipsing nature of the system was confirmed. = 该系统的非食性质得到了证实。


疑问句:
Is the binary system noneclipsing? = 这个双星系统是非食的吗？
Are these stars noneclipsing? = 这些恒星是非食的吗？


否定句:
The binary is not noneclipsing; it shows periodic dips in brightness. = 这个双星系统并非是非食的；它显示出周期性的亮度下降。
The star is not classified as noneclipsing. = 这颗恒星未被归类为非食的。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "noneclipsing".  The term is primarily used in its literal astronomical context.  Phrases would need to be built around the concept. For example:


noneclipsing binary systems  = 非食双星系统
observations of noneclipsing binaries = 对非食双星的观测
characteristics of noneclipsing stars = 非食恒星的特征
analysis of noneclipsing data = 对非食数据的分析
the noneclipsing nature of… = …的非食性质
