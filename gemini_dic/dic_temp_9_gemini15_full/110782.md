The word "linia" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full etymological analysis, usage examples, synonyms, or antonyms in the requested format.  If you can provide the correct spelling or the language of origin, I can offer assistance.
