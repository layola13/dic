overnationalized: /ˌoʊvərˈnæʃənəlaɪzd/ | adj. | 过度民族化的；超越国家界限的 |  Excessively nationalized; extending beyond national boundaries. The term often implies a negative connotation, suggesting an excessive focus on national interests to the detriment of international cooperation or global perspectives.


英文解析:The word "overnationalized" is formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") to "nationalized," which itself describes something brought under state control.  Therefore, "overnationalized" describes a situation where national control or influence has become excessive or inappropriately extended.  This can apply to various aspects, including economies, industries, or even political ideologies.
