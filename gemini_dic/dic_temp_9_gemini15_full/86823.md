词源:

* **hemato-**:  From Greek *haima*, meaning "blood."
* **-logist**: From Greek *-logos*, meaning "study" or "science."
* **-'s**:  English possessive suffix.

Therefore, "hematologist" literally means "one who studies blood," and "hematologist's" signifies something belonging to or associated with such a person.
