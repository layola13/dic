Etymology:

The word "nutant" comes from the Latin verb *nutare*, meaning "to nod" or "to sway."  This verb is related to the Latin word *nuo*, also meaning "to nod." The suffix "-ant" is a present participle suffix, indicating something that is doing the action of the verb.  Therefore, "nutant" literally means "nodding" or "swaying," specifically describing a downward movement.
