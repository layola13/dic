corrosivities:/ˌkɔːroʊˈsɪvətiz/ | n. |腐蚀性，侵蚀性 |The term "corrosivities" refers to the degree or extent to which a substance causes corrosion.  It encompasses the various properties and characteristics of materials that contribute to their ability to degrade or damage other materials through chemical or electrochemical reactions.  This includes factors like acidity, alkalinity, oxidizing potential, and the presence of specific ions.  The higher the corrosivity, the more damaging the substance is to other materials. |例句：The study investigated the corrosivities of different types of acid on various metals. 这项研究调查了不同类型酸对各种金属的腐蚀性。

The corrosivities of the wastewater need to be carefully monitored. 废水的腐蚀性需要仔细监测。|近义词：corrosiveness, erosiveness,destructiveness |反义词：inertness, passivity

词源:

The word "corrosivities" is derived from the adjective "corrosive," which in turn comes from the Latin verb "corrodere," meaning "to gnaw," "to eat away," or "to erode."  The suffix "-ivity" indicates a quality or state, thus "corrosivities" signifies the degree or capacity of causing corrosion.
