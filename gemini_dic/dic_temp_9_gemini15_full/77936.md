The word "genoes" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a place name, a surname, or a brand name not widely known.
* **It's a neologism or technical term:** It might be a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field.
* **It's from a different language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language.

If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, a sentence it appeared in, etc.), I may be able to assist you further.
