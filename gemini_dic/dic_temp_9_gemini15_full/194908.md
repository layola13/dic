semi-illiterateness: /ˌsɛmiˌɪlɪtərətˈnɪs/ | n. | 半文盲；半识字 |  A state of having limited literacy skills;  the condition of being only partially literate.  It implies a level of reading and writing ability below what is considered functional or adequate for everyday life. This is not necessarily due to a lack of education, but rather a gap between formal education and practical application of literacy skills.
