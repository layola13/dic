词源:
The word "deadline" originated in the late 19th century in the context of prisons.  A "dead line" was originally a line that prisoners were forbidden to cross, often drawn around a prison or execution area.  If a prisoner crossed this line, they faced execution.  The term eventually evolved to refer to any limit or point beyond which something is no longer possible or permissible.
