词源:  The word "demoralization" is derived from the verb "demoralize," which itself comes from the French word "démoraliser," a combination of "dé-" (meaning "un-" or "away from") and "moraliser" (meaning "to moralize" or "to instill morals").  The original meaning, therefore, hinted at a removal or loss of morals, but the modern usage focuses more on the loss of spirit and confidence.
