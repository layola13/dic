词源:
The word "overhandle" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "handle" (meaning "to deal with" or "to manage").  Therefore, it literally means "to handle too much."  Its usage reflects a relatively modern development, arising from the increasingly complex nature of modern management and problem-solving. There isn't a traceable historical etymology beyond this straightforward composition.
