词源:

The word "schmalz" comes from the Yiddish word שמאָלץ (shmalts), meaning "rendered chicken fat" or "lard".  Its figurative meaning, referring to excessive sentimentality, developed later, likely due to the rich, often overly sweet nature of dishes made with schmaltz.  The association between richness and excessive emotionality gave rise to its current usage.
