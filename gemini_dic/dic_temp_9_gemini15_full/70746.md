fine-tuning:/ˈfaɪnˌtuːnɪŋ/ | n. |微调；精细调整 |The process of making small adjustments to a system or model to improve its performance.  It often involves making subtle changes to parameters or hyperparameters to optimize the output. For example, in machine learning, fine-tuning a pre-trained model involves adapting it to a specific task or dataset. |例句：After initial training, we performed fine-tuning on a smaller dataset to improve accuracy.  在初步训练之后，我们在较小的数据集上进行了微调以提高准确性。|近义词：adjustment, refinement, optimization |反义词：coarse adjustment, rough tuning |词性:名词
