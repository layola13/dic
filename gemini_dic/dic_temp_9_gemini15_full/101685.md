* **remediable:**  An adjective meaning "capable of being remedied or corrected."  This comes from the Latin "remedium" (remedy).
* **-ness:** A suffix that transforms an adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality.
* **-es:**  A plural suffix.

Therefore, "irremediablenesses" literally means "the states or qualities of being incapable of being remedied or corrected" (plural).
