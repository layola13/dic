The word "cockes" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a very obscure, regional term.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To help you, I need clarification:

* **Did you intend to spell a different word?**  Please provide the correct spelling if you can.  Similar-sounding words might include "cocks," "cooks," "coaxed," etc.  Even a slightly different spelling could make a huge difference.

* **What is the context in which you encountered this word?** Knowing the sentence or paragraph where you saw "cockes" would greatly assist in determining its intended meaning and potential origin.

Once you provide this information, I can offer a more accurate and helpful analysis.
