impedances:/ɪmˈpiːdənsɪz/| n. |阻抗(复数)|The opposition to the flow of alternating current in an electrical circuit, comprising resistance and reactance.|The high impedance of the headphones prevented a clear sound.|近义词：resistance, reactance|反义词：conductance

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The impedance of this circuit is high. = 这个电路的阻抗很高。
What impedance does this speaker have? = 这个扬声器的阻抗是多少？


一般过去时:
The impedance was too high for the amplifier. = 阻抗对于放大器来说太高了。
We measured the impedance yesterday. = 我们昨天测量了阻抗。


现在完成时:
Engineers have calculated the impedance. = 工程师们已经计算出了阻抗。
They have reduced the impedance significantly. = 他们已经显著降低了阻抗。


过去完成时:
The impedance had already been measured before the test. = 在测试之前阻抗已经被测量过了。
We had underestimated the impedance. = 我们低估了阻抗。


将来时:
The impedance will be lower at higher frequencies. = 在更高的频率下，阻抗将会更低。
They will measure the impedance tomorrow. = 他们明天将测量阻抗。


虚拟语气:
If the impedance were lower, the signal would be clearer. = 如果阻抗更低，信号会更清晰。
I wish the impedance was lower. = 我希望阻抗更低。


被动语态:
The impedance was calculated by the engineer. = 阻抗是由工程师计算的。
The impedance is being tested now. = 阻抗正在被测试。


疑问句:
What is the impedance of this component? = 这个组件的阻抗是多少？
How do we measure the impedance? = 我们如何测量阻抗？


否定句:
The impedance is not low enough. = 阻抗不够低。
We did not measure the impedance correctly. = 我们没有正确测量阻抗。


PHRASE->
high impedance = 高阻抗
low impedance = 低阻抗
input impedance = 输入阻抗
output impedance = 输出阻抗
characteristic impedance = 特性阻抗
