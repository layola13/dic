endodermic:/ˌɛndoʊˈdɜːrmɪk/| adj.|内胚层的；内胚叶的 | Relating to the endoderm, the innermost of the three primary germ layers of an embryo.  The endoderm develops into the lining of the digestive tract and other internal organs. |Example: The endodermic cells eventually differentiate into various tissues of the digestive system. 内胚层细胞最终分化成消化系统的各种组织。|近义词:entodermal|反义词:ectodermic, mesodermic
