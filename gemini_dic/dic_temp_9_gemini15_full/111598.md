词源:
The word "lobster" comes from the Old French "lobistre," possibly from a Germanic source related to "loppen" (to leap or hop), describing the lobster's movement. "Trap" is from the Old English "trappe," meaning a snare or pitfall.  The compound "lobster-trap" simply combines these two words to describe a trap specifically designed for catching lobsters.
