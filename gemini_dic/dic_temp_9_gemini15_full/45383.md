词源:

The word "cunningnesses" is derived from the adjective "cunning," which comes from the Old English word "cunnan," meaning "to know" or "to be able."  Over time, "cunnan" evolved to mean skillful and clever, but also sly and deceitful. The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "cunning" into a noun, indicating a quality or state of being cunning. The addition of "-es" makes it plural, referring to multiple instances or types of cunning behavior.
