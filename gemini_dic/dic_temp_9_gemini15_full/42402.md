词源:
The word "counterclaim" is a compound word formed from "counter," meaning "against" or "in opposition to," and "claim," meaning "a statement that something is true."  Therefore, a counterclaim is a claim made in opposition to another claim.  The word evolved naturally from the legal and argumentative contexts where opposing statements are common.
