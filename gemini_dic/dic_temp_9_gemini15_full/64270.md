equiradial:/ˌiːkwɪˈreɪdiəl/| adj. |等径的，等辐射的|Having or characterized by equally spaced radii.  It describes a structure or pattern where all radii are of equal length from a central point.|The spokes of a perfectly constructed wheel are equiradial.|近义词：isoradial, equiangular (in certain contexts)|反义词：irregular, unequal


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The spokes of this wheel are equiradial. = 这个轮子的辐条是等长的。
This design features equiradial lines emanating from the center. = 这个设计特点是从中心辐射出来的等长线。


一般过去时:
The ancient structure showed remarkably equiradial construction. = 古代建筑展现出非常出色的等径结构。
The artist's design was based on equiradial patterns. = 艺术家的设计基于等径图案。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered many examples of equiradial formations in nature. = 科学家们已经发现了自然界中许多等径结构的例子。
Researchers have confirmed that the pattern is indeed equiradial. = 研究人员已经证实该图案确实是等径的。


过去完成时:
Before the restoration, the wheel's spokes were not equiradial. = 修复之前，车轮的辐条不是等长的。
The analysis revealed that the earlier design had not been perfectly equiradial. = 分析表明，早期的设计并非完全等径。


将来时:
Future designs will likely incorporate more equiradial elements. = 未来的设计可能会包含更多等径元素。
We will test whether the new material allows for perfectly equiradial construction. = 我们将测试新材料是否允许完全等径的结构。


虚拟语气:
If the design were perfectly equiradial, it would be stronger. = 如果设计完全等径，它会更坚固。
I wish the radiating lines were more equiradial. = 我希望辐射线更等径。


被动语态:
The symmetry of the object is achieved through equiradial arrangement. = 物体的对称性是通过等径排列实现的。
Equiradial patterns are often found in natural phenomena. = 等径图案经常出现在自然现象中。


疑问句:
Are the lines emanating from the center equiradial? = 从中心辐射出来的线是等长的吗？
Is the structure characterized by equiradial symmetry? = 该结构的特点是等径对称吗？


否定句:
The spokes are not perfectly equiradial. =辐条并非完全等长。
The pattern is not strictly equiradial. =图案并非严格等径。


PHRASE->
equiradial symmetry = 等径对称
equiradial pattern = 等径图案
equiradial arrangement = 等径排列
equiradial construction = 等径结构
equiradial lines = 等径线
