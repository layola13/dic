词源:

The word "governableness" is derived from the verb "govern" and the suffix "-able," which means "capable of being."  "Govern" itself has roots in Old French "governer" and ultimately Latin "gubernāre," meaning "to steer, to guide."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "governable" into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being governable.
