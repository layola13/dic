词源：

The word "non-visceral" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "visceral."  "Visceral" comes from the Latin word "viscera," meaning "internal organs."  The original meaning of "visceral" related to the internal organs, but it evolved to describe strong, instinctive emotions felt deeply within, as if they originated from these organs.  Therefore, "non-visceral" denotes the absence of these deep, instinctive feelings.
