词源:

* **over-**:  prefix indicating excess or to a greater degree than normal. (过度，超过)
* **optimism**: from Latin *optimum* ("best") + *ismus* (suffix forming nouns denoting doctrines, systems, etc.). (乐观主义)


用法说明:

* **overoptimisms** is a noun, and usually used in the plural form.  It refers to multiple instances of excessive optimism.  While you *could* theoretically use it in the singular,  it's less common and sounds somewhat awkward.  Using "overoptimism" directly would be more natural.
* It's often used to describe situations where excessive optimism has led to negative consequences.

The word does not have verb, adjective or adverb forms.  You would use other words to express those aspects, for example:

* **Adjective**: Overoptimistic (过度乐观的)
* **Verb**: To be overoptimistic (过于乐观)
* **Adverb**: Overoptimistically (过于乐观地)


There is no need to provide grammatical tenses, voices, etc., for a single noun.  The grammatical usage would be determined by the sentence in which it's used.
