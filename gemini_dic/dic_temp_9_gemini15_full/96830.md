词源:

The word "inestimabilities" is derived from the adjective "inestimable," which itself comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the verb "estimate."  "Estimate" comes from the Old French "estimer," ultimately from the Latin "aestimare," meaning "to value, appraise, or estimate." Therefore, "inestimable" means "not able to be estimated or valued," and "inestimabilities" refers to things possessing this quality.
