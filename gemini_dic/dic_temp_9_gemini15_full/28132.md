词源:
The word "capitol" ultimately derives from the Latin word "capitolium," which referred to the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus on the Capitoline Hill in ancient Rome.  This temple was a center of Roman political and religious life, and the term came to be associated with government and legislative power. Over time, "capitolium" evolved into the English word "capitol," retaining the connection to governmental buildings.


用法说明:
capitol主要用作名词，指州议会大厦或（美国）国会大厦。它通常指一个具体的建筑物，而非泛指的政府建筑。  需要注意的是，"Capitol"（首字母大写）通常特指美国的国会大厦，而州议会大厦则用小写"capitol"。


例句:
1.  Many tourists visit the state capitol every year.  每年都有许多游客参观州议会大厦。

2.  The Capitol dome is a recognizable symbol of American democracy. 国会大厦圆顶是美国民主的标志性象征。
