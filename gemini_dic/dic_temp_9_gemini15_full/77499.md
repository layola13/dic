词源:  The word "gazetteer" derives from "gazette," a newspaper or official journal, ultimately from the Italian word *gazzetta*, a small coin, referring to the price of early newspapers.  The suffix "-eer" indicates a person or thing connected with the noun. Thus, a gazetteer originally referred to a writer or compiler of a gazette, and later, the geographical dictionary itself.
