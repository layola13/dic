词源:
The word "overlavish" is a combination of "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and "lavish" (meaning "sumptuous" or "extravagant").  Both parts have Germanic origins. "Lavish" traces back to Old French "laviss," possibly related to Old French "laver" (to wash), suggesting an abundance like a washing of riches.
