词源:

From Late Latin *puncticulosus, from punctum "point," ultimately from Latin pungere "to prick, sting."  The sense development is from "making points" (of emphasis or precision) to "meticulous."


用法说明：

Punctilious is used to describe someone who pays close attention to details and is very careful in their actions and behavior. It often implies a level of formality and precision that can sometimes be seen as excessive.  The word carries a slightly more positive connotation than some synonyms like "fussy" or "picky," suggesting a dedication to accuracy and correctness rather than mere nitpicking.
