词源:

The word "nonirritancy" is derived from:

* **non-**: a prefix meaning "not"
* **irritant**: an adjective meaning "causing irritation" (from Latin *irritare* "to provoke, excite")
* **-cy**: a suffix forming nouns of state or quality


Therefore, "nonirritancy" literally means "the state of not being irritating."
