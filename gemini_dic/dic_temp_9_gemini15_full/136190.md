USAGE->
This word is extremely rare and does not have common usage in typical grammatical structures.  Its usage would be highly context-dependent within specialized academic writing, likely in fields like sociology or anthropology.  Therefore, providing examples for standard grammatical tenses would be artificial and misleading.  The word itself is a plural noun, requiring a context that necessitates a multiple reference to unrelatedness.

PHRASE->
Because of the word's rarity and specialized usage, providing common phrases is not possible.
