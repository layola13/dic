fugato:/fjuˈɡɑːtoʊ/| n.|赋格曲，赋格段|A fugato is a passage of music that resembles a fugue in its imitative counterpoint, but does not adhere strictly to all the rules of a true fugue.  It often features a prominent subject or theme that is developed through imitation and counterpoint, but may lack some of the structural elements of a formal fugue, such as multiple expositions or a fully developed countersubject. | Example: The composer cleverly incorporated a brief fugato into the otherwise lyrical melody.  作曲家巧妙地将一段简短的赋格曲融入到原本抒情的旋律中。|近义词：fugue (a true fugue), imitation|反义词：none|名词
