The word "rure" is not a word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a word from a specific dialect, jargon, or technical field not widely known.  If so, please provide context.
* It's a newly coined word or a proper noun.  Again, context is needed.


Please provide more information so I can assist you.
