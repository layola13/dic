completement:/kəmˈpliːmənt/ | n. | 补充物；补语；补足语 | A word, phrase, or clause that completes the meaning of a verb or other element in a sentence. It can be an object, an adverbial, or a subject complement.  | Example:  In the sentence "She painted the house red," "red" is a complement.  |近义词：addition, supplement, completion | 反义词：deficiency, lack


The complement completes the predicate of a sentence.  There are several types of complements:

* **Object Complements:** These complete the meaning of a transitive verb by describing the object.

Example:  They elected him president. ("president" complements "him")
Example: We painted the wall blue. ("blue" complements "wall")


* **Subject Complements:** These complete the meaning of a linking verb by describing the subject.

Example: She is a doctor. ("doctor" complements "she")
Example: He became a lawyer. ("lawyer" complements "he")


* **Adverbial Complements:** These complete the meaning of a verb by providing additional information about the action, such as time, place, or manner.  Often, they are prepositional phrases or adverb clauses.

Example: He lives in London. ("in London" complements "lives")
Example: She arrived late. ("late" complements "arrived")


* **Prepositional Complements:** These are nouns or noun phrases that complete the meaning of a preposition.

Example:  The book is on the table. ("the table" complements "on")
Example:  She relies on her friends. ("her friends" complements "on")


**Etymology:**

From Old French *complement*, from Latin *complementum* "that which fills up," from *complere* "to fill up," from *com-* "together" + *plere* "to fill."


**Usage Note:**  The term "complement" is often used interchangeably with "object" and "predicate," but in technical grammar, these are distinct.  The complement completes the predicate, while the object is a specific type of complement.  The subject complement describes the subject.  The term "complement" serves as a broader category encompassing all the above types.
