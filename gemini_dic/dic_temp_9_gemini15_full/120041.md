millisecond:/ˈmɪlɪˌsɛkənd/ | n. |毫秒|A millisecond is one thousandth of a second.  It's a unit of time used to measure very short durations.  |例句：The computer responded in a few milliseconds. 这台电脑在几毫秒内做出了回应。

The system crashed after just one millisecond of overload. 系统在过载仅一毫秒后就崩溃了。|近义词：thousandth of a second |反义词：second, minute, hour (these represent longer durations) |名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
A millisecond is a very short amount of time. = 毫秒是很短的一段时间。
How many milliseconds does it take to process this data? = 处理这些数据需要多少毫秒？


一般过去时:
The reaction time was less than a millisecond. = 反应时间不到一毫秒。
The server responded in 10 milliseconds. = 服务器在10毫秒内做出了回应。


现在完成时:
The computer has processed the data in under a millisecond. = 电脑已在不到一毫秒的时间内处理了数据。
We have measured the response time in milliseconds. = 我们已经用毫秒来测量响应时间。


过去完成时:
The process had already completed in less than a millisecond before the error occurred. = 在错误发生之前，该过程已在不到一毫秒的时间内完成。
They had waited only a few milliseconds before the signal arrived. = 信号到达之前，他们只等了几毫秒。


将来时:
The system will respond in a few milliseconds. = 系统将在几毫秒内做出响应。
It will take less than a millisecond to complete the calculation. = 完成计算将不到一毫秒。


虚拟语气:
If the response time were only a millisecond, the system would be much more efficient. = 如果响应时间只有一毫秒，系统效率就会高得多。
I wish the program could run in just one millisecond. = 我希望程序只需一毫秒就能运行。


被动语态:
The data was processed in a few milliseconds. = 数据在几毫秒内得到处理。
The problem was solved in a millisecond. = 问题在一毫秒内得到解决。


疑问句:
How many milliseconds does this operation take? = 此操作需要多少毫秒？
What is the average response time in milliseconds? = 平均响应时间是多少毫秒？


否定句:
The system did not respond within a millisecond. = 系统在一毫秒内没有响应。
It didn't take a millisecond to complete the task. = 完成任务不需要一毫秒。


PHRASE->
response time in milliseconds = 毫秒级的响应时间
processing time in milliseconds = 毫秒级的处理时间
a few milliseconds = 几毫秒
under a millisecond = 少于一毫秒
within a millisecond = 在一毫秒内


词源:
milli- (from Latin "mille," meaning "thousand") + second (unit of time)
