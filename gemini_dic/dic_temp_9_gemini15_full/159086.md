词源:
The word "poaching" ultimately derives from the Old French word "pochier," meaning "to thrust in a pocket," or "to put into a bag or pouch."  This refers to the act of secretly and illegally taking something. The culinary use of poaching (as in poaching an egg)  also comes from this root, referring to gently submerging something in liquid. Over time, the meaning specialized to refer primarily to the illegal hunting of game.
