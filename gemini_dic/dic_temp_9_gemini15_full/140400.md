词性:名词


词源:  The word "ointment" comes from the Old French *ointment*, derived from the verb *oindre*, meaning "to anoint."  This ultimately traces back to the Latin *unguere*, also meaning "to anoint."  The original meaning involved applying a fragrant or medicinal substance, often an oil, as a ritual or healing practice.
