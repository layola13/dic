词源:

* **self-**:  Prefix meaning "of or relating to oneself."
* **complacency**:  From Latin "complacentia," meaning "pleasure, satisfaction."  This in turn comes from "complacēre," meaning "to please, gratify."

  The "-ential" suffix transforms the noun "complacency" into an adjective, describing something characterized by or related to complacency.
