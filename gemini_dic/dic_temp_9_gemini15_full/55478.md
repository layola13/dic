词源:
The word "distracted" comes from the Latin word "distractus," the past participle of "distrahere," meaning "to draw apart" or "to pull in different directions."  The prefix "dis-" indicates separation or negation, while "trahere" means "to draw" or "to pull." Therefore, "distracted" literally means "pulled apart" or "drawn away" mentally.
