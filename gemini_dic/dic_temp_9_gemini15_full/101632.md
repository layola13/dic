irreducibility: /ˌɪrˌɪˌduːsəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 不可约性，不可简化性 | The inability to be reduced or simplified further.  It often refers to a mathematical or logical concept, but can also be used in other contexts to describe something that cannot be broken down into smaller, simpler components. | Example: The irreducibility of the polynomial ensures the uniqueness of its solution.  多项式的不可约性确保了其解的唯一性。 The irreducibility of the problem made it very difficult to solve. 问题的不可约性使得它很难解决。|近义词：unreducibility, indivisibility, simplicity | 反义词：reducibility, divisibility, complexity |

词源:

The word "irreducibility" comes from the prefix "ir-" (meaning "not"), the verb "reduce" (meaning "to make smaller or simpler"), and the suffix "-ibility" (meaning "capable of").  Therefore, it literally means "not capable of being reduced."  The root "duc" comes from Latin, meaning "to lead."
