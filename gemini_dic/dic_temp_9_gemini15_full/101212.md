词源:  The word "invisibility" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") + "visibility" (the state of being visible). "Visibility" in turn comes from the Latin word "visibilis," meaning "visible," which is derived from "videre," meaning "to see."  Therefore, invisibility literally means "not able to be seen."
