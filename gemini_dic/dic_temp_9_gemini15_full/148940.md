词源:  The word "overwrest" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much") and the verb "wrest."  "Wrest" itself comes from Old English *wræstan, meaning "to twist," "to turn," or "to wrench."  The sense of forcibly taking something evolved from the idea of twisting or wrenching it away.
