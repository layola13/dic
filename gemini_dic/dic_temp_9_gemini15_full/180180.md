词源:

The word "reformed" comes from the Old French word "reformer," which in turn comes from the Latin word "reformare." "Re-" means "again" or "back," and "formare" means "to form" or "to shape."  Therefore, "reformed" literally means "to form again" or "to reshape."  The sense of improvement and correction evolved from the original meaning of reshaping or restructuring.
