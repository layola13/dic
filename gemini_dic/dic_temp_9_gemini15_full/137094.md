The word "nonstyptical" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need to consider possible intended words.  If you could clarify the intended spelling or provide context, I can offer a more accurate analysis.
