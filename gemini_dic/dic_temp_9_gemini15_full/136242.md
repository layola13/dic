英文解析：The word "nonrepairable" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "repairable" (meaning "capable of being repaired").  It indicates that something is beyond repair and cannot be fixed.  This often applies to physical objects but can also be used metaphorically.

词源：

* **non-**:  A prefix of negation, meaning "not".  Derived from Latin *non*.

* **repairable**:  Derived from the verb "repair," which comes from Old French *repaier* (to amend, compensate), ultimately from Latin *reparare* (to prepare again, repair).  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or possibility.


用法说明：

"Nonrepairable" is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that cannot be fixed or restored to its original condition.  It emphasizes the finality of the damage or breakdown.  The word is generally used in a formal or technical context.  While "irreparable" is a close synonym, "nonrepairable" might be slightly less emphatic.
