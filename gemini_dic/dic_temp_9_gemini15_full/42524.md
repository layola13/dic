countermagnets: /ˈkaʊntərmæɡnɪts/ | n. | 反磁铁 | A countermagnet is a magnet used to counteract the effect of another magnet.  It's often used to neutralize or reduce the magnetic field of a primary magnet. | Example:  The device uses a countermagnet to prevent the needle from being deflected by external magnetic fields.  这个装置使用反磁铁来防止指针被外部磁场偏转。|近义词： opposing magnet, neutralizing magnet | 反义词： magnet (in the context of its opposing effect) | 名词
