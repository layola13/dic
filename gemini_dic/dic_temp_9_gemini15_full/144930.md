词源：
The phrase "over with" is a combination of the preposition "over" and the preposition "with."  "Over" in this context signifies completion or termination, while "with" adds a sense of finality or being done.  The exact origin is difficult to pinpoint, but its usage likely developed organically from the common use of "over" to indicate completion.
