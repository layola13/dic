hypervelocity: /ˌhaɪpərˈvɛləsɪti/ | adj. |超高速的；极高速的 | Extremely high velocity;  speed far exceeding the speed of sound.  It often refers to speeds that cause significant physical effects due to the immense kinetic energy. | 例句：The hypervelocity impact of the meteorite caused a massive crater.  陨石的超高速撞击造成一个巨大的陨石坑。

The spacecraft entered the atmosphere at hypervelocity.  宇宙飞船以超高速进入大气层。


近义词：supersonic, extremely high speed, ultra-high speed | 反义词：low velocity, slow speed | 词性：形容词

词源:

The word "hypervelocity" is a modern scientific term.  It is a compound word formed from:

* **hyper-:**  A prefix meaning "above," "beyond," or "excessive."  It derives from the Greek word ὑπέρ (hupér), meaning "over," "above," "beyond."

* **velocity:**  The speed of something in a given direction.  It derives from the Latin word *velocitas*, meaning "speed," "swiftness."

Therefore, "hypervelocity" literally means "excessive speed" or "speed beyond normal."
