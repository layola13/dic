词源:

From Latin *fatidicus, from *fateor ("I confess, speak") + -dicus ("-speaking").  The root is connected to the concept of uttering something divinely revealed, hence prophetic.


用法说明：

Fatidical is primarily used to describe something that suggests or predicts a future event, especially one that is negative or ominous. It implies a sense of foreboding or inevitability.  The word carries a more formal and literary tone than simpler synonyms like "predictive" or "ominous."  It often appears in contexts relating to prophecies, omens, or other forms of divination.
