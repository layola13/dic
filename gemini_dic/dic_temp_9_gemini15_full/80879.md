The word "governablenesses" is not a commonly used word. It's a rather uncommon plural form of "governableness," which itself is not frequently encountered in everyday language.  It's derived from the verb "govern" and the suffix "-able," meaning capable of being governed, plus the plural suffix "-nesses."

Word Origin:

* **govern:** From Old French *gouvernir*, from Latin *gubernāre* ("to steer, direct, govern").
* **-able:** From Old French *-able*, from Latin *-ābilis*.
* **-ness:**  Old English *-nes*, a suffix forming abstract nouns.

Usage Notes:

Because "governablenesses" is a plural noun referring to multiple instances of governability, its usage requires careful consideration of context to ensure clarity.  It suggests a comparison or discussion of the degrees of governability across multiple entities or situations.  For example, one might compare the governablenesses of different countries or different social groups.

Example Sentences (illustrative, given the word's uncommon usage):


The study compared the governablenesses of three different city districts, revealing significant disparities in social cohesion and responsiveness to government initiatives. 这项研究比较了三个不同城市区域的可治理性，揭示了社会凝聚力以及对政府举措的响应能力方面的显著差异。


The contrasting governablenesses of the two nations highlight the importance of strong institutions and effective leadership in maintaining stability.  这两个国家的可治理性形成对比，突显了强大的制度和有效的领导在维持稳定方面的重要性。


Since the word is rarely used, more typical and straightforward alternatives would generally be preferred in most writing.  One could use phrases like:  "degrees of governability," "levels of manageability," "different capacities for governance," or simply "manageability" in the plural.
