词源:
The word "ingrainedness" is derived from the verb "ingrain," which itself comes from the Old English "in-," meaning "in," and "graen," meaning "dye" or "color."  Initially, "ingrain" meant to dye something deeply, to color it thoroughly.  The meaning then extended metaphorically to the deep embedding of ideas, habits, or qualities within a person or society.  The "-ness" suffix adds the abstract noun quality, resulting in "ingrainedness."
