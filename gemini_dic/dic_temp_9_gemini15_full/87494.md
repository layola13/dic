heterocera:/ˌhɛtəˈrɒsərə/| n. |异翅亚目昆虫|Heterocera is a taxonomic suborder within the order Lepidoptera, encompassing moths and other related insects.  It is characterized by their typically nocturnal habits,  feathery antennae, and often duller coloration compared to butterflies (Rhopalocera).  The suborder is quite diverse, including many families of moths with varying characteristics. The term is now less frequently used in modern classification systems, as phylogenetic analysis has led to a restructuring of lepidopteran taxonomy.|The study of Heterocera revealed numerous fascinating adaptations to nocturnal life.|近义词：moths (less precise, as it doesn't encompass all Heterocera)|反义词：Rhopalocera (butterflies)|名词
