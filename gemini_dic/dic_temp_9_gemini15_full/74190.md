The word "fourest" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  To get the information you need, please provide the correct spelling of the word you intended.
