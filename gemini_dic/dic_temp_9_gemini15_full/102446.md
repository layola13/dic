词源:
The word "jacket" ultimately derives from the Old French word "jaquette," a diminutive of "jaque," meaning a padded coat or doublet.  The word "jaque" itself has roots in the late Latin word "jacca," which referred to a type of short coat or tunic.  Therefore, the word's evolution reflects a gradual shortening and modification of terms describing various types of outer garments.
