reoxidations:/ˌriːˌɒksɪˈdeɪʃənz/| n. |再氧化作用；再氧化过程|The process of oxidizing something again after it has been reduced.  This often occurs in materials science and chemistry, referring to the regaining of oxygen atoms or a similar increase in oxidation state. |例句：The reoxidations of the metal surface led to increased corrosion. 金属表面的再氧化导致了腐蚀加剧。

The repeated reoxidations of the catalyst deactivated it. 催化剂的反复再氧化使其失活。|近义词：re-oxidation, oxidation (in the context of a repeated process)|反义词：reduction


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Reoxidation occurs frequently in certain environments. = 再氧化作用在某些环境中经常发生。
The process of reoxidation requires specific conditions. = 再氧化过程需要特定的条件。


一般过去时:
Reoxidation of the sample took place at high temperatures. = 样品的再氧化发生在高温下。

将来时:
Reoxidation will likely occur if the material is exposed to air. = 如果材料暴露在空气中，很可能会发生再氧化。
The engineers predict that further reoxidations will compromise the structural integrity. = 工程师预测，进一步的再氧化将危及结构完整性。


虚拟语气:
If the temperature were lower, reoxidation would be less likely. = 如果温度更低，再氧化的可能性会更小。
