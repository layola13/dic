词源:
The word "fudgy" derives from the noun "fudge," which itself has an uncertain etymology.  One theory suggests it's a playful alteration of "to foul" (to make a mess), reflecting the process of making fudge, which can be somewhat messy. Another theory traces it to a possible origin in a Northern English dialect word, but no definitive source has been established.  The "-y" suffix transforms the noun "fudge" into an adjective describing a quality or characteristic associated with fudge.
