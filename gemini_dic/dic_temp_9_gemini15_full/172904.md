The word "quaintnesses" derives from the adjective "quaint," which ultimately originates from the Old French word "coint," meaning "clever, skillful, neat."  Over time, the meaning shifted to describe something attractively unusual or old-fashioned. The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "quaint" into a noun, indicating the quality or state of being quaint.  Therefore, "quaintnesses" refers to multiple instances or aspects of this quality.
