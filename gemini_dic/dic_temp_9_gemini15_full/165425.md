词源：

From Middle French *prelature, from Late Latin prælatura, from prælatus, past participle of præferre "to prefer, set before," from præ- "before" + ferre "to bear, carry."  Ultimately derived from the Latin verb *ferre, meaning "to carry" or "to bear," reflecting the idea of a prelate being placed in a position of authority or preference.


用法说明：

Prelature primarily refers to a church district or territory under the jurisdiction of a prelate (a high-ranking church official, often a bishop).  It can also refer to the office or dignity of a prelate.  The term is used less frequently than "diocese" but carries a similar meaning, often implying a more specific or specialized administrative unit within a larger church structure.  It can also describe the system or organization of church governance within a prelature.
