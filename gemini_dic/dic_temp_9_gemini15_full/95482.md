词源:  The word "incivism" is formed by adding the prefix "in-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") to the word "civism."  "Civism" itself derives from "civic," ultimately from the Latin word "civicus," meaning "of or relating to a citizen."  Therefore, "incivism" literally means "not being a good citizen" or "lack of good citizenship."
