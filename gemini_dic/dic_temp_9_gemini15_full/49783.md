词源:
The word "demonises" comes from the noun "demon," meaning an evil spirit, and the suffix "-ise," which is a verb-forming suffix indicating "to make or become."  The ultimate origin of "demon" is from the Greek word "daimon," meaning a spirit, divinity, or fate.  Over time, the meaning shifted to primarily refer to an evil spirit.
