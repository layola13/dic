Word Origin:

The word "semisomnolence" is a combination of:

* **semi-:**  A prefix meaning "half" or "partially."
* **somnolence:**  From the Latin "somnolentia," meaning "sleepiness" or "drowsiness."  This in turn derives from "somnus," meaning "sleep."

Therefore, "semisomnolence" literally means "half sleepiness" or a state of partial drowsiness.
