digenea:/daɪdʒəˈniːə/| n. |双型吸虫类；双腔吸虫 |Digeneans are a large group of parasitic flatworms belonging to the class Trematoda. They are characterized by having two suckers, one oral and one ventral, used for attachment to their hosts. They exhibit complex life cycles, often involving multiple intermediate hosts and a definitive host.  |Example:  Many digeneans infect fish, causing significant economic losses in aquaculture. 许多双型吸虫感染鱼类，给水产养殖造成巨大的经济损失。|近义词:trematode (更广义的术语)|反义词:None|名词
