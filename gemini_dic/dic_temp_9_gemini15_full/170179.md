protoplast:/ˈproʊtoʊplæst/| n. |原生质体|A protoplast is a plant or bacterial cell that has had its cell wall removed.  It is essentially the cell's contents (cytoplasm, nucleus, organelles) enclosed by only the cell membrane. Protoplasts are used in plant biotechnology for various purposes, including genetic engineering and plant cell fusion. |Example: Scientists used protoplast fusion to create a new variety of tomato with increased disease resistance. 科学家们利用原生质体融合技术培育出具有增强抗病能力的新型番茄品种。|近义词：cell (in some contexts)|反义词：None
