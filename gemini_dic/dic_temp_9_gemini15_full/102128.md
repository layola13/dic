isotropous: /aɪˈsɒtrəpəs/ | adj. | 各向同性的 | Having properties that are the same when measured in all directions.  A material is isotropic if its physical properties are independent of the direction of measurement. This is in contrast to anisotropic materials, which exhibit different properties in different directions. For example, the speed of light in an isotropic material is the same regardless of its direction of propagation. |  The wood is nearly isotropous in its mechanical properties. 这块木材的力学性能几乎是各向同性的。 |近义词：homogeneous | 反义词：anisotropic
