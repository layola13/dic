词源:

The word "overspeculative" is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much") with the adjective "speculative" (relating to speculation or conjecture).  "Speculative" itself comes from the Latin word "speculare," meaning "to look at," "to observe," or "to examine."  Over time, this evolved to encompass the sense of forming opinions based on incomplete information, hence "speculation."
