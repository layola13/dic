词源:
From Latin *Pleiades, from Ancient Greek Πλειάδες (Pleíades), from πλέειν (pléin, "to sail"), referring to the constellation's use in navigation.  The name literally means "the sailing ones" or those who sail.  The connection is that the appearance of the Pleiades in the night sky signaled the favorable time for sailing.
