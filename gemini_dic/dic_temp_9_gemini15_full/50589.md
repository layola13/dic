词源:

The word "derailment" is derived from the verb "derail," which itself is a combination of "de-" (meaning "off" or "away from") and "rail."  Therefore, the word literally means "the act of being moved off the rails."  The metaphorical extension to describe the disruption of plans or progress followed naturally.
