词源:
The word "cornmeal" is a compound word. "Corn" originally referred to any grain, but in North America, it specifically came to mean maize (Zea mays).  "Meal" refers to the ground form of a grain.  Therefore, cornmeal literally means "ground maize."  The word's evolution reflects the importance of maize in various cultures.
