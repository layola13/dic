hydrocorallia:/ˌhaɪdroʊkəˈrælɪə/| n. |水螅珊瑚类|Hydrocorallia is a taxonomic order of colonial marine hydrozoans characterized by a calcareous skeleton.  They are often found in shallow, warm waters and contribute significantly to reef-building.  Unlike true corals (Scleractinia), hydrocorals possess a distinct polyp structure and their skeletons are formed differently.  They are also typically smaller and less diverse than scleractinian corals.|Example:  The research team studied the growth patterns of various hydrocorallia species in the Caribbean.|近义词: hydrozoans (broader term)|反义词: N/A
