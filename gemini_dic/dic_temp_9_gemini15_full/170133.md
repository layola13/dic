protocorm:/ˈproʊtəˌkɔːrm/| n. |原球茎，原原球茎|A protocorm is an undifferentiated, embryonic mass of cells in certain plants, particularly orchids, that develops into a seedling.  It's a stage in the life cycle before the development of true leaves and roots.  It's often a swollen, fleshy structure that provides nourishment for the developing plant. | Example:  The orchid seed germinated and formed a protocorm.  兰花种子发芽并形成了原球茎。 The protocorm gradually developed into a seedling with distinct leaves and roots. 原球茎逐渐发育成具有明显叶片和根系的幼苗。|近义词:embryo, seedling (in some contexts)|反义词:mature plant
