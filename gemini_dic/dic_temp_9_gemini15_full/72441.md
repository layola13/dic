fluids:/ˈfluːɪdz/ | n. |流体，液体 | Substances that flow and change shape easily, such as liquids and gases.  Fluids are characterized by their ability to conform to the shape of their container. They are also easily deformed by shear stress. This contrasts with solids, which maintain a fixed shape unless acted upon by a force large enough to break them.  | Example: Blood is a fluid that circulates throughout the body.  血液是一种在全身循环的流体。|近义词：liquids, gases |反义词：solids
