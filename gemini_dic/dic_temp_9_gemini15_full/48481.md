词源:

The term "deep-six" originates from nautical slang.  In the context of disposing of something at sea, "six" refers to the six fathoms (36 feet) of depth considered to be sufficient to ensure the object would not be found.  The "deep" simply emphasizes the thoroughness of the disposal. Therefore, "deep-six" implies a complete and irreversible removal.
