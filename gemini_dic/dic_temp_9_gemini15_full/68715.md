词源:

The word "farflung" is a compound word.  "Far" is an Old English word meaning "distant," and "flung" is the past participle of the verb "fling," meaning "to throw or cast."  Therefore, "far-flung" literally means "thrown far away" or "spread far and wide."  Its figurative use evolved to describe things that are geographically spread out or remote.
