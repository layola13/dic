词源:
The word "singletree" is a compound of "single" and "tree."  It refers to a single piece of wood used to harness a single animal, unlike a "doubletree" which is used for two animals.  The "tree" element refers to the branching shape, reminiscent of a tree's branches.  The term has its roots in Old English and reflects the evolution of agricultural technology.
