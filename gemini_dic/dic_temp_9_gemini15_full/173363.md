词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi* meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation.

* **discreetly**: From the adjective *discreet*, which originates from the Old French *discret*, ultimately from the Latin *discrētus*, the past participle of *discernere* meaning "to separate," "to distinguish."  Discreet implies careful and prudent behavior, especially in avoiding causing offense or attracting attention.


用法说明:

quasi-discreetly is an adverb, modifying a verb to describe how an action is performed.  It suggests an action done with the intention of being discreet, but perhaps falling short of complete success or appearing slightly clumsy in its attempt at secrecy.  The "quasi-" prefix softens the meaning of "discreetly," indicating an approximation rather than a perfect execution of discretion.
