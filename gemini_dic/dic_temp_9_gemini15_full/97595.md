USAGE->
This word is unusual and grammatically awkward.  "Inhabitedness" itself is a noun, and adding "'s" creates a possessive form referring to the state or quality of something related to inhabitedness.  Therefore, standard grammatical tense analysis is not applicable in the same way as with regular verbs.  It's more appropriate to discuss how "inhabitedness" is used in different sentence structures.
