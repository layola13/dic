The word "prower" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible there's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a dialect word, or a proper noun.  To provide a detailed analysis as requested, I need a correct word.  Please double-check the spelling or provide more context.
