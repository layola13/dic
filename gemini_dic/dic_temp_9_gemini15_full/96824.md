The word "inescation" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, word class, meaning, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
2. **It's a neologism:** It might be a newly coined word not yet widely accepted.  If this is the case, please provide context where you encountered this word.  This context will help determine its intended meaning.
3. **It's a technical term:** It might be specific to a particular field or subfield (e.g., scientific, medical, or technical jargon).  If this is the case, specifying the field would help in finding a definition.
4. **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a name, place, or brand name.


Please provide more information so I can assist you better.
