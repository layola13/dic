词源：

The word "professionalism" is derived from the word "professional," which in turn comes from the Middle English word "professione," ultimately tracing back to the Late Latin word "professio," meaning "declaration," "avowal," or "open expression." The suffix "-ism" indicates a characteristic, practice, or doctrine.  Therefore, professionalism signifies the characteristic qualities or practices associated with a profession.
