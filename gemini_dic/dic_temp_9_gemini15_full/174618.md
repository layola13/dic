词源:
The word "quittance" comes from the Old French word "quittance," meaning "release," "discharge," or "acquittance."  This, in turn, is derived from the Old French verb "quiter," meaning "to acquit," "to release," or "to settle."  The ultimate origin traces back to the Vulgar Latin *quittare,  a variant of Latin *computare, "to compute, reckon," ultimately relating to the idea of settling accounts.
