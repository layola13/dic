词源:  The word "highfalutin" is of uncertain origin, but likely arose in American English in the 19th century.  It's possibly a blend of "high-flown" (meaning lofty or extravagant) and an unknown element, perhaps influenced by the sound of other words suggesting pretentiousness.  The exact etymology remains debated among linguists.
