hyperintensely:/ˌhaɪpərɪnˈtɛnsli/ | adv. | 高强度地，过度强烈地 |  Describes something that is extremely intense or strong, often in a way that is excessive or noticeable. It usually refers to a signal or image, particularly in medical imaging (like MRI), that is brighter than normal, indicating a higher than expected signal intensity. | Example: The lesion appeared hyperintensely on the MRI scan.  核磁共振扫描显示病灶呈高信号强度。 | 近义词：intensely, exceedingly, excessively | 反义词：weakly, faintly, subtly | 无


USAGE->
This word is primarily used to describe the intensity of a signal or image,  so grammatical tense examples using it in typical sentence structures would be unnatural.  The word's use is highly context-specific within the medical and scientific fields.  It doesn't lend itself to standard tense conjugations like other verbs or adjectives.


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "hyperintensely".  The word itself is quite technical.
