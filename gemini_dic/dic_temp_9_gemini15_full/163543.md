precorruptnesses:/ˌpriːkəˈrʌptnəsɪz/ | n. | 预先腐败；事先腐败的行为 |  The word "precorruptnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, likely formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before or beforehand), "corrupt" (meaning dishonest or immoral), and "-nesses" (a plural suffix indicating multiple instances of a quality or state).  Therefore, it would refer to instances of corruption that occurred before a certain point in time or a specific event.  It suggests a preemptive or anticipatory nature to the corrupt actions.  There are no standard dictionaries that list this word.  To understand its meaning, one must analyze its constituent parts. |  Example: The investigation uncovered numerous precorruptnesses that paved the way for the larger scandal. (调查发现了许多先前的腐败行为，为更大的丑闻铺平了道路。) | 近义词: prior acts of corruption, previous instances of dishonesty, antecedent malfeasance | 反义词:  prior integrity, previous honesty, antecedent probity | 名词
