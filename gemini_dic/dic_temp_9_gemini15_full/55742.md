USAGE->
This word is rare and not consistently defined across dictionaries.  Therefore, providing standard grammatical tenses is not applicable as "diverb" itself isn't a standard grammatical element. The usage examples would focus on its function as a pun or word with double meaning.

Example 1:
"Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana."  This sentence uses diverbs (or puns) to create humor.  This is a famous example of a sentence with multiple possible interpretations due to the double meaning of "flies."  时间飞逝如箭；果蝇喜欢香蕉。 这句话利用歧义词（或双关语）创造幽默感。这是例句中因“flies”一词的双重含义而具有多种可能解释的著名例子。

Example 2:
"The comedian's joke about the chicken crossing the playground was a clever diverb."  The word diverb is used here to describe the joke's use of double meaning. 喜剧演员关于小鸡过操场的笑话是一个巧妙的歧义词。 此处使用“diverb”一词来形容笑话中双重含义的运用。
