counterslope:/ˈkaʊntərsloʊp/| n. |反斜坡，逆坡|A slope that is opposite in direction to the main slope; a reverse slope.  A counterslope is often found on hillsides, where the land slopes in the opposite direction to the main incline.  This can be due to various geological processes, such as erosion or the deposition of sediment.  Counterslopes can create unique microclimates and habitats. |例句：The counterslope provided a sheltered area for the small village. 反斜坡为这个小山村提供了一个避风的区域。


The construction of the road required careful consideration of the counterslope to prevent landslides.  修建这条路需要仔细考虑反斜坡以防止山体滑坡。|近义词：reverse slope, opposing slope |反义词：main slope, primary slope
