/ˌpriːˌsuːtəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 预先的适合性；先决条件 |  The word "presuitabilities" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism,  likely formed by combining "pre-" (before) and "suitabilities" (the state of being suitable).  Therefore, a precise definition and usage examples are impossible to provide. However, based on its constituent parts, we can infer a possible meaning and provide hypothetical examples. It would likely refer to the qualities or attributes that are necessary *before* something else can be deemed suitable. |  Example:  The presuitabilities for the job included a master's degree and five years of experience. (假设例句: 这份工作的先决条件包括硕士学位和五年工作经验。) | 近义词: prerequisites, preconditions, qualifications | 反义词:  N/A (due to the non-standard nature of the word) | 名词
