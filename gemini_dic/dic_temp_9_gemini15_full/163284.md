词源:
The word "preconditioned" is formed from the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance"), the verb "condition" (meaning "to prepare" or "to treat"), and the suffix "-ed" (indicating the past participle).  The root of "condition" traces back to the Latin word "condicio," meaning "state," "situation," or "agreement."  Therefore, "preconditioned" literally means "prepared beforehand" or "treated in advance."
