* **laborious**: From Latin *labor*, meaning "work," "toil," or "effort."  The suffix *-ious* forms adjectives.

用法说明：

"Quasi-laborious" describes something that requires a significant amount of effort, but not to the extreme degree implied by words like "arduous" or "grueling."  It suggests a task that is somewhat demanding, time-consuming, or tiresome, but not necessarily exceptionally difficult or overwhelmingly challenging.  It implies a level of effort that is noticeable but not necessarily insurmountable.
