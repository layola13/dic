lipoprotein:/ˈlaɪpoʊˌproʊtiːn/ | n. |脂蛋白|A lipoprotein is a biochemical assembly that combines lipids (fats) with proteins.  These complexes are essential for transporting fats and cholesterol in the bloodstream because fats are insoluble in water.  Different types of lipoproteins exist, each with varying densities and functions. For example, low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) are often referred to as "bad" cholesterol, while high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are considered "good" cholesterol.| Example: High levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) in the blood can increase the risk of heart disease. 高密度脂蛋白(LDL)在血液中的高水平会增加患心脏病的风险。|近义词: lipid-protein complex |反义词: None specifically, but the terms "low-density lipoprotein" and "high-density lipoprotein" are often contrasted.
