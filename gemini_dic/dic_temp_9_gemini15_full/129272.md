The word "nodee" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you intended another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word or a term used within a specific community or context.  If so, please provide more context.
* **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a name or place name.  Again, more context is needed.

Please provide more information or correct the spelling so I can assist you.
