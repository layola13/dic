phosphorescence:/ˌfɒsfəˈrɛs(ə)ns/| n. |磷光；磷光现象|The emission of light by a substance without the production of heat.  This is a slow process that can continue for some time after the exciting radiation has ceased.  It is distinct from fluorescence, which is a rapid process.|例句：The glow-in-the-dark stickers exhibit phosphorescence.  这些夜光贴纸呈现磷光现象。

The sea was alive with the phosphorescence of countless tiny organisms.  无数微小生物的磷光照亮了大海。|近义词：luminescence|反义词：fluorescence (in terms of speed of emission)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The glow-in-the-dark paint shows phosphorescence. = 夜光涂料显示出磷光。
Some minerals exhibit phosphorescence. = 一些矿物会发出磷光。


一般过去时:
The experiment demonstrated phosphorescence. = 实验展示了磷光现象。
The rocks phosphoresced faintly in the dark. = 这些石头在黑暗中发出微弱的磷光。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied phosphorescence for centuries. = 科学家们已经研究磷光现象几个世纪了。
The material has retained its phosphorescence for hours. = 这种材料的磷光持续了数小时。


过去完成时:
Before the lights went out, the audience had already noticed the subtle phosphorescence. = 在灯熄灭之前，观众已经注意到了微弱的磷光。
They had observed the phosphorescence only after exposing the substance to UV light. = 只有在将物质暴露于紫外线下后，他们才观察到磷光。


将来时:
The new material will exhibit a brighter phosphorescence. = 新材料将展现更亮的磷光。
We will study the mechanisms of phosphorescence in the next experiment. = 我们将在下一次实验中研究磷光的机制。


虚拟语气:
If the substance contained phosphorus, it would show phosphorescence. = 如果这种物质含有磷，它就会发出磷光。
I wish I could see the phosphorescence more clearly. = 我希望我能更清楚地看到磷光。


被动语态:
Phosphorescence was observed in the sample. = 在样品中观察到了磷光。
The properties of phosphorescence are being investigated. = 正在研究磷光的特性。


疑问句:
Does this mineral exhibit phosphorescence? = 这种矿物会发出磷光吗？
What causes the phosphorescence in this organism? = 这种生物的磷光是由什么引起的？


否定句:
The sample did not show any noticeable phosphorescence. = 样本没有显示任何明显的磷光。
The material does not phosphoresce under normal light conditions. = 在正常光照条件下，这种材料不会发出磷光。


PHRASE->
phosphorescence decay: 磷光衰减
phosphorescence lifetime: 磷光寿命
phosphorescence imaging: 磷光成像
phosphorescence spectroscopy: 磷光光谱学
organic phosphorescence: 有机磷光


词源:
From  phosphorus + -escence (suffix denoting a process or state).  Phosphorus itself is derived from Greek  phos ("light") + phoros ("bearing").  Thus, phosphorescence literally means "light-bearing process."
