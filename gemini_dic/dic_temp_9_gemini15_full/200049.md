WORD ORIGIN->
The verb "skepticize" is derived from the noun "skeptic," ultimately tracing back to the Greek word "skeptikos," meaning "inquiring," "investigative," or "doubting."  The root is "skeptesthai," meaning "to look," "to consider," or "to examine."  The modern usage reflects the philosophical tradition of skepticism, which emphasizes questioning and critical examination of beliefs and claims.
