PHRASE->

由于“quasi-clerically”本身是一个修饰动词的副词性形容词，它通常不与其他词构成固定词组。  它主要与描述行为或举止的动词搭配使用。 例如：


speak quasi-clerically
act quasi-clerically
conduct oneself quasi-clerically
demean oneself quasi-clerically
deliver (a speech) quasi-clerically


词源:

"Quasi" is from Latin, meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."  "Clerically" derives from "cleric," which comes from Late Latin *clericus, from Greek κληρικός (klērikós), from κλῆρος (klēros) "lot, inheritance, clergy."  Therefore, "quasi-clerically" literally means "almost or seemingly like a cleric" in their manner of acting.
