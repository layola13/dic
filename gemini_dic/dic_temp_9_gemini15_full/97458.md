infusorial:/ˌɪnfjuːˈzɔːriəl/| adj.|  硅藻的；由硅藻组成的 | Relating to or consisting of infusoria (a now obsolete term for microscopic organisms, mainly diatoms).  The term often refers to diatomaceous earth, a sedimentary rock composed of fossilized diatoms. | Example: The sedimentary rock was of infusorial origin, rich in fossilized diatoms.  这沉积岩起源于硅藻，富含硅藻化石。  The microscope revealed an infusorial structure in the sample. 显微镜显示样品具有硅藻结构。|近义词：diatomaceous|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The sample contains infusorial remains. = 样本含有硅藻残留物。
This sediment is largely infusorial in nature. =  这种沉积物本质上主要是硅藻的。


一般过去时:
Scientists studied the infusorial deposits. = 科学家研究了硅藻沉积物。
The analysis revealed a high concentration of infusorial material. = 分析显示高浓度的硅藻物质。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several types of infusorial organisms. = 研究人员已经鉴定了几种类型的硅藻生物。
The impact of infusorial deposits on the environment has been widely studied. = 硅藻沉积物对环境的影响已被广泛研究。


过去完成时:
Geologists had already established the infusorial nature of the rock. = 地质学家已经确定了岩石的硅藻性质。
They had found many infusorial fossils in the area. = 他们在该地区发现了许多硅藻化石。


将来时:
Scientists will analyze the infusorial content of the sample. = 科学家将分析样品的硅藻含量。
We will use this technique to investigate the infusorial composition of the sediment. = 我们将使用这种技术来研究沉积物的硅藻成分。


虚拟语气:
If the material were purely infusorial, it would be very porous. = 如果物质完全是硅藻的，它将非常多孔。
I wish I had known the infusorial composition before the analysis. = 我希望在分析之前就知道硅藻成分。


被动语态:
The infusorial origin of the rock was confirmed. = 岩石的硅藻成因得到了证实。
The sample is being examined for infusorial content. = 样本正在接受硅藻含量的检查。


疑问句:
Is this material of infusorial origin? = 这种物质是硅藻成因的吗？
What is the percentage of infusorial matter in this sample? = 这个样品中硅藻物质的百分比是多少？


否定句:
The sediment was not entirely infusorial. = 沉积物并非完全是硅藻的。
This type of rock does not contain significant infusorial remains. = 这种类型的岩石不含大量的硅藻残留物。


PHRASE->
infusorial earth = 硅藻土
infusorial remains = 硅藻残骸
infusorial deposit = 硅藻沉积物
infusorial origin = 硅藻成因
infusorial structure = 硅藻结构
