nonhemolytic: /ˌnɒnˌhiːməˈlɪtɪk/ | adj. | 不溶血的 |  Not causing the destruction of red blood cells.  This term is often used in microbiology and medicine to describe bacteria or other microorganisms that do not lyse (break down) red blood cells when grown on blood agar.  | Example: The bacterial culture showed nonhemolytic growth on the blood agar plate.  该细菌培养在血琼脂平板上显示为不溶血性生长。 | 近义词: non-lytic, innocuous (in this specific context) | 反义词: hemolytic


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The bacteria are nonhemolytic. = 细菌是不溶血的。
This strain is nonhemolytic in nature. = 这种菌株本质上是不溶血的。


一般过去时:
The test results indicated that the bacteria were nonhemolytic. = 测试结果表明细菌是不溶血的。
The previous culture was nonhemolytic. = 上一次的培养是不溶血的。


现在完成时:
The lab has confirmed that the bacteria are nonhemolytic. = 实验室已确认细菌是不溶血的。
Scientists have identified several nonhemolytic strains. = 科学家们已经鉴别出几种不溶血菌株。


过去完成时:
Researchers had already determined that the organism was nonhemolytic. = 研究人员此前已经确定该生物是不溶血的。
It had been previously established that the bacteria were nonhemolytic. = 之前已经确定细菌是不溶血的。


将来时:
The results will show whether the bacteria are hemolytic or nonhemolytic. = 结果将显示细菌是溶血性还是非溶血性。
We expect the new strain to be nonhemolytic. = 我们预计新菌株将是不溶血性的。


虚拟语气:
If the bacteria were nonhemolytic, the patient would not have experienced hemolysis. = 如果细菌是不溶血性的，病人就不会发生溶血。
It would be ideal if all strains were nonhemolytic. = 如果所有菌株都是不溶血性的，那就最好了。


被动语态:
The bacteria were identified as nonhemolytic. = 细菌被鉴定为不溶血性的。
The sample was determined to be nonhemolytic. = 样本被确定为不溶血性的。


疑问句:
Are these bacteria nonhemolytic? = 这些细菌是不溶血的吗？
Is this strain known to be nonhemolytic? = 这种菌株已知是不溶血的吗？


否定句:
The bacteria are not nonhemolytic; they are hemolytic. = 细菌不是不溶血性的；它们是溶血性的。
This particular strain is not considered nonhemolytic. = 这种特殊的菌株不被认为是不溶血性的。


PHRASE->
nonhemolytic streptococci = 不溶血性链球菌
nonhemolytic bacteria = 不溶血性细菌
nonhemolytic infection = 不溶血性感染
nonhemolytic growth = 不溶血性生长
nonhemolytic alpha-hemolytic = 非溶血性α-溶血性 (需注意此为组合描述，非单一词组)
