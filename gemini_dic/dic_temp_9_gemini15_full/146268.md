词源：

The word is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "to an excessive degree" or "beyond") and the adverb "faintly" (meaning "weakly," "imperceptibly").  Therefore, "overfaintly" signifies a degree of faintness that surpasses the usual meaning of "faintly".  The root of "faint" can be traced back to Old French "faindre" (to feign, dissemble), which evolved to refer to a lack of strength or clarity.
