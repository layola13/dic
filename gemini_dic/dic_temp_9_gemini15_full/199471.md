synapse:/ˈsɪnæps/| n. |突触|A synapse is a junction between two nerve cells, consisting of a minute gap across which impulses pass by diffusion of a neurotransmitter.|例句：The synapse is a critical point of communication between neurons. 突触是神经元之间交流的关键点。|近义词：junction, connection|反义词：None|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
