词源:
The word "divulge" comes from the Old French word "divulguer," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "divulgare."  "Divulgare" is formed from "dis-" (apart, asunder) and "vulgare" (to make common, to publish).  Therefore, the original meaning points to the act of making something common or public that was previously private or hidden.
