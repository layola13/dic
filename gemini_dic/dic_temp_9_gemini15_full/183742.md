词源:
The word "rescheduler" is formed by combining the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") with the word "scheduler".  "Scheduler" originates from "schedule" (a plan or program of activities), which has roots in the Middle English word "schedulare," ultimately from Old French "schedulier."  Therefore, "rescheduler" literally means "one that schedules again" or "one that re-schedules."
