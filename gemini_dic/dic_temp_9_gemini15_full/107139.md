词源:  The word is formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" (indicating a plural of qualities or states) to "ladylike," which itself combines "lady" (referring to a woman of refined manners and social standing) and "-like" (meaning "resembling" or "having the characteristics of").  Therefore, "ladylikenesses" signifies the multiple aspects or instances of ladylike qualities.
