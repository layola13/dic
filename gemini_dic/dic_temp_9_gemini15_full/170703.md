pseudoanemias:/ˌsuːdoʊəˈniːmiəz/| n. |假性贫血|A condition that mimics the symptoms of anemia (low red blood cell count) but is not caused by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin.  Instead, it's due to other factors that cause the blood to appear diluted or less efficient in carrying oxygen.|Example:  Some forms of pseudoanemia are caused by fluid retention, which dilutes the blood, making it appear anemic even though the red blood cell count is normal.  一些假性贫血是由体液潴留引起的，这会稀释血液，即使红细胞计数正常，也会使血液看起来像贫血。|近义词：relative anemia, apparent anemia|反义词：true anemia
