USAGE->
This word is primarily a linguistic term and doesn't have typical verb conjugations like "hello."  It describes a phenomenon, not an action. Therefore, grammatical tense examples are not applicable.  Instead, examples illustrating the different contexts where holophrasis occurs are provided.

Example in early child language development:
"Juice!" = "I want some juice."

Example in telegraphic speech:
"Car go!" = "The car is going."


Example in aphasia:
A patient might say "Dog!" to convey a whole story about seeing a dog.


Example showing the range of meaning a holophrase can convey depending on context:
"Mommy!" = Could mean "Where's mommy?", "I need mommy!", or "I see mommy!"
