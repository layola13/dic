词源:

The word "overrewarding" is a compound word formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "rewarding" (meaning "giving a reward").  "Rewarding" itself comes from the noun "reward," ultimately deriving from Old French *re(s)warder, from re- "back" + warder "to guard, keep."  The sense shifted from guarding to recompense.
