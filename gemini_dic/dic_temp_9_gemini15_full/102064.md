isomorphism:/aɪˈsɒmɔːrfɪzəm/ | n. | 同构；同形；同态映射 | A one-to-one correspondence between two sets that preserves a particular structure.  In mathematics, it refers to a structure-preserving map between two structures of the same type.  This means that the map not only associates elements from one structure to the other but also preserves the relationships between those elements.  For example, in graph theory, an isomorphism between two graphs ensures that if two vertices are connected in one graph, their corresponding vertices are connected in the other graph. | Example: "The two groups are isomorphic, meaning there exists a bijective map between them that preserves the group operation."  = 这两个群是同构的，这意味着它们之间存在一个保持群运算的双射映射。|近义词：equivalence, correspondence |反义词：difference, distinction


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in a mathematical context and doesn't have typical tense variations like a verb.  Instead, its usage revolves around describing the relationship between two structures.  Therefore, standard tense conjugations are not applicable.


PHRASE->

isomorphism theorem = 同构定理
group isomorphism = 群同构
ring isomorphism = 环同构
graph isomorphism = 图同构
canonical isomorphism = 典范同构
