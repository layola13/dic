Etymology:

The word "quartzose" is derived from the word "quartz," ultimately from the German word "Quarz," which itself has a debated origin.  Some sources suggest it may be related to the Slavic word for "hard," reflecting the mineral's hardness.  The suffix "-ose" is a common suffix in geology and chemistry, indicating "full of" or "resembling."  Therefore, "quartzose" literally means "full of quartz" or "resembling quartz."
