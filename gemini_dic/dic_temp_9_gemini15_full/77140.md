词源:  From Late Latin *gaseosus, from Latin *gas, of obscure origin.  The word "gas" itself was coined by the Flemish chemist Jan Baptista van Helmont in the 17th century, possibly derived from the Greek word "chaos" (χάος), meaning "emptiness" or "void", or from a similar-sounding word in his native Dutch.
