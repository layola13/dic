词源:

The word "caviler" comes from the Middle English word "cavil," which means "to find fault, quibble."  This, in turn, derives from the Old French word "cavil," and ultimately from the Latin word "cavilla," meaning "jest, quip, or trick."  The shift in meaning from "jest" to "find fault" reflects a change in how such trivial objections were perceived – from playful banter to annoying nitpicking.
