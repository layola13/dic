PHRASE->
(There is no common phrase directly using "cheesinesses".  The word itself is used to describe a collection of instances.)  Instead, here are phrases related to the concept:

a lot of cheese = 很多俗气
over-the-top sentimentality = 过于夸张的感伤
affected sweetness = 做作的甜美
lack of authenticity = 缺乏真实性
obvious artificiality = 明显的人工痕迹

词源:  The word "cheesinesses" is derived from "cheesy," meaning something affectedly sentimental or excessively sweet.  "Cheesy" itself has origins in the mild, sometimes bland flavor of cheese, which is metaphorically extended to describe something lacking in substance or originality, hence "cheesy."  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "cheesy" into a noun, denoting a quality or state.  The addition of "-es" makes it plural, indicating multiple instances of cheesiness.
