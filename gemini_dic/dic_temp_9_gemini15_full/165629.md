The word "preministering" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is not possible.  It might be a blend of "pre-" (meaning before) and "ministering" (meaning to attend to the needs of someone).  However, without context, its intended meaning and usage are unclear.
