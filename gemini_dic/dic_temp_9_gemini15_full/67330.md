词源:
The word "extemporizer" is derived from the Latin word "extempore," meaning "out of time" or "without preparation."  It combines this with the English suffix "-izer," which indicates an agent or doer of an action.  Therefore, an extemporizer is someone who performs or speaks without prior preparation.
