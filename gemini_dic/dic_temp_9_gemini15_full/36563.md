词源:

The word originates from the verb "collapse," which itself has a complex etymology.  "Collapse" comes from the Latin prefix "col-" (together) and the verb "lapsus," the past participle of "labi" (to slip, to fall).  Therefore, the core meaning is "to fall together."  The suffix "-ibility" is a common English suffix that creates nouns indicating capacity or capability.
