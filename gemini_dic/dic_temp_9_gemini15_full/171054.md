pseudoviscous:/ˌsuːdoʊˈvɪskəs/| adj.|伪粘性的，拟粘性的 |  Describes a fluid or material that exhibits behavior similar to a viscous fluid, but this behavior is not due to true viscosity but rather to some other mechanism, such as numerical techniques used in simulations.  It mimics the effects of viscosity without actually possessing it.  | Example:  The pseudoviscous term in the numerical model dampened the oscillations.  伪粘性项在数值模型中抑制了振荡。|近义词：artificial viscosity, numerical viscosity |反义词：truly viscous
