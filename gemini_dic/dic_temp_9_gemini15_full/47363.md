词源:
The word "deacon" comes from the Late Latin word *diaconus*, which in turn comes from the Greek word διάκονος (diakonos), meaning "servant" or "minister".  The Greek word was used in the early Christian church to refer to those who served the apostles and assisted in the church's administration.
