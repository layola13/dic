词源:
The word is a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "pluralistic."  "Pluralistic" derives from "pluralism," which comes from the Latin word "pluralis" (meaning "more than one").  Pluralism, in a philosophical and sociological sense, refers to a condition or system in which several distinct groups or viewpoints coexist.  Therefore, "non-pluralistic" directly opposes this concept.
