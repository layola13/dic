USAGE->
This word is so rarely used that providing examples in various tenses is impractical and unnatural.  The word itself is a noun, and its usage would be within a sentence describing a person's behavior, not as a verb or in other grammatical structures.

For example:

Sentence 1: Her hyperfastidiousnesses were legendary among her colleagues.  她的过分挑剔在同事中是出了名的。

Sentence 2:  The architect's hyperfastidiousnesses led to significant cost overruns and delays. 建筑师的过分讲究导致了严重的成本超支和延误。


PHRASE->
Because "hyperfastidiousnesses" is a single, rarely used word, it does not have common phrases associated with it.  Instead, we can look at phrases using related words:

Phrase 1:  Pay attention to detail (注重细节)
Phrase 2:  Meticulous attention to detail (对细节一丝不苟的关注)
Phrase 3:  Perfectionist tendencies (完美主义倾向)
Phrase 4:  High standards (高标准)
Phrase 5:  A stickler for accuracy (对精确性吹毛求疵的人)


词源:

The word is formed by combining several elements:

* **hyper-**:  A prefix meaning "excessive," "over," or "beyond."
* **fastidious**: An adjective meaning "very attentive to and concerned about accuracy and detail."  This word originates from the Latin *fastidium*, meaning "weariness, disgust."  The sense of "excessive care" developed later.
* **-ness**: A suffix forming abstract nouns of quality or state.  This suffix is of Old English origin.
* **-es**: A plural suffix.


The combination creates a noun representing the state or quality of being excessively fastidious.
