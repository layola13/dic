词源:
The word "intermeddler" comes from the verb "intermeddle," which is formed from the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and the verb "meddle" (meaning "to interfere").  "Meddle" itself has roots in Old English and Middle English, ultimately relating to concepts of mixing or mingling. Therefore, an intermeddler is someone who mixes or interferes in matters that do not concern them.
