词源:
From Middle English *paramount, from Anglo-Norman French paramount, from Old French paramount, from Latin per amount, literally "through the amount," from per "through" + amount "amount, sum, quantity."  The meaning shifted from "above all others in quantity or importance" to "supreme" or "chief" over time.
