词源:  The word "prestigeful" is derived from the French word "prestige," meaning "illusion," "magic," or "prestige."  Over time, "prestige" came to denote a high reputation or influence, typically associated with power, success, or status.  The suffix "-ful" was added to create the adjective "prestigeful," meaning "full of prestige" or "characterized by prestige."


用法说明:

"Prestigeful" is an adjective used to describe something or someone that commands respect, admiration, and influence due to high status or achievement.  It is less frequently used than its synonym "prestigious," but carries a similar meaning.  While both words describe high standing, "prestigeful" might subtly emphasize the inherent quality of the prestige, rather than simply the presence of it.  However, this distinction is subtle and often interchangeable in practice.
