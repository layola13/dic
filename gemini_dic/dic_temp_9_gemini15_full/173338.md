词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."

* **dependently**: From "dependent," derived from the Old French *dependent*, ultimately from the Latin *dependēns*, present participle of *dependēre*, meaning "to hang down from," "to be suspended from," and later, "to rely on."


用法说明:

This adverb is relatively uncommon and is used in more formal or technical contexts. It's best employed when describing a situation where a clear dependence exists, but some level of autonomy or independence also remains.  It avoids the absolute nature of "dependently" by suggesting a nuance of incompleteness or conditionality.  There is no specific grammatical tense associated with the adverb itself, but the sentence it appears in will, of course, have a tense.
