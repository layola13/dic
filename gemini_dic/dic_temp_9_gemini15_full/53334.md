词源:
The word "disacquaintance" is a relatively modern formation, combining the prefix "dis-" (meaning "removal of," "lack of," or "opposite of") with the noun "acquaintance."  The root "acquaint" comes from the Old French "acointer," meaning "to make known," ultimately derived from Latin "ad-" (to) + "cognitus" (known).  Therefore, "disacquaintance" signifies the state of being removed from or lacking familiarity, the opposite of knowing someone well.
