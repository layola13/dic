词源:
The word "demagogue" comes from the Greek words "dēmos" (δήμος), meaning "people," and "agōgos" (ἀγωγός), meaning "leader" or "guide."  Therefore, its literal meaning is "leader of the people." However, the modern usage carries a strongly negative connotation.  The term gained prominence in ancient Greece, where it referred to orators who appealed to the emotions of the masses to gain political power, often with dishonest or manipulative tactics.
