What factors catalyzed the revolution? = 哪些因素引发了这场革命？


否定句:
The reaction was not catalyzed efficiently. = 反应没有被有效催化。
The proposed policy did not catalyze any significant changes. = 提出的政策没有催化任何重大变化。


PHRASE->
catalytic converter: 催化转化器
catalytic activity: 催化活性
catalytic effect: 催化作用
catalytic oxidation: 催化氧化
catalytic cracking: 催化裂化


词源:
源自希腊语“kata-” (down) 和 “lyein” (to loosen)，字面意思是“松动”，后演变为“促进反应”。  The term evolved from its use in chemistry to describe substances that accelerate chemical reactions without being consumed themselves.
