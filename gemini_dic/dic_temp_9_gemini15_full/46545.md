The word "dall" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please double-check the spelling.
2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name or a place name not widely known.
3. **It's a slang term or dialect word:**  It might be used informally in a specific region or community.
4. **It's a newly coined word:**  It might be a very recent invention not yet included in dictionaries.

If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, the surrounding sentence, etc.), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
