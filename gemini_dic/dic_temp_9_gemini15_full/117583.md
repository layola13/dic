mega- (great, large) + mania (madness, obsession) + -ac (suffix forming adverbs) + -ally (suffix forming adverbs)  The word combines the Greek roots "mega" (meaning "great") and "mania" (meaning "madness" or "obsession"), implying an excessive and delusional sense of self-importance. The "-ally" suffix transforms the adjective "megalomaniacal" into an adverb.
