digestedness's: /daɪˈdʒɛstɪdnəsɪz/ | n. | 消化性；已消化状态的 | The state or quality of being digested; the completeness of digestion.  This word is extremely rare and generally considered incorrect;  "digestedness" itself is uncommon. The possessive 's adds further unusualness.  A better choice would be to use "digestion" or a phrase describing the degree of digestion. | Example: The *digestedness's* of the food was questionable after such a short cooking time. (This sentence is grammatically correct but stylistically poor and would be better phrased differently.) | 近义词: digestion, assimilation (in the context of absorption) | 反义词: indigestibility  |  词性: noun (possessive)
