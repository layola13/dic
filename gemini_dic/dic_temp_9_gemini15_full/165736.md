/ˌpriːˈnɛɡlɪdʒəns/ | n. | 事先疏忽；预先的过失 |  Prenegligence refers to negligence that occurs before an event, often setting the stage for a later, more significant negligent act. It involves a failure to take preventative measures or to foresee and mitigate potential risks, leading to a subsequent harmful outcome.  This term is less common than "negligence" itself and often appears in legal contexts to describe a chain of events leading to harm.  |  The company's prenegligence in failing to maintain its equipment led to the accident. 公司在维护设备方面的事先疏忽导致了事故。  The doctor's prenegligence in misdiagnosing the patient's condition contributed to the patient's deteriorating health. 医生在误诊病人病情方面的预先过失导致了病人的病情恶化。 | negligence, carelessness, oversight | carefulness, diligence, foresight |
