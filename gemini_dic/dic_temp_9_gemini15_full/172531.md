pyritohedron: /ˌpaɪrɪˈtoʊˌhiːdrən/ | n. | 黄铁矿晶体 | A pyritohedron is a type of crystal that is characterized by its twelve pentagonal faces.  It's often found in pyrite (iron sulfide), hence its name.  The faces are not regular pentagons, and the overall shape is not quite a regular dodecahedron.  | Example: The sample contained several well-formed pyritohedrons.  这个样本包含几个形状良好的黄铁矿晶体。| 近义词: dodecahedron (though not perfectly synonymous) | 反义词:  N/A  |  名词
