precession:/prɪˈsɛʃən/| n.| 岁差；旋进；预先行动|The slow, conical motion of the Earth's axis, completing a cycle approximately every 26,000 years.  This movement causes the gradual shift in the position of the stars relative to the Earth's equator.  It also refers to a similar wobbling motion in other rotating bodies. |例句：The precession of the equinoxes affects the timing of seasons over long periods.  地球岁差影响着漫长时期内季节的时间。

The precession of a spinning top is a familiar example. 旋转陀螺的进动是一个熟悉的例子。|近义词：nutation, wobble, gyration|反义词：N/A


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The Earth's axis experiences precession. = 地球的轴线正在经历岁差。
Precession affects the timing of seasons. = 岁差影响季节的时间。


一般过去时:
Scientists observed the precession of the equinoxes. = 科学家们观测到了春分岁差。
The ancient astronomers understood precession. = 古代天文学家理解岁差。


现在完成时:
Astronomers have mapped the precession of the Earth's axis. = 天文学家已经绘制了地球自转轴岁差的地图。
Researchers have studied the effects of precession. = 研究人员已经研究了岁差的影响。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery of precession, the timing of seasons was less understood. = 在发现岁差之前，人们对季节的时间规律理解较少。
They had already calculated the rate of precession. = 他们已经计算出了岁差的速率。


将来时:
The Earth's axis will continue to precess. = 地球的轴线将继续进动。
Future astronomers will continue to study precession. = 未来天文学家将继续研究岁差。


虚拟语气:
If the Earth's rotation were different, the precession would be different. = 如果地球的自转不同，岁差也会不同。
If we didn't understand precession, our calendars would be inaccurate. = 如果我们不理解岁差，我们的日历就会不准确。


被动语态:
The precession of the Earth's axis is observed by astronomers. = 地球自转轴的岁差被天文学家观测到。
The rate of precession is determined through precise measurements. = 岁差的速率是通过精确测量来确定的。


疑问句:
What causes the precession of the Earth's axis? = 什么导致了地球自转轴的岁差？
How does precession affect the celestial sphere? = 岁差如何影响天球？


否定句:
Precession is not a simple phenomenon. = 岁差并非一个简单的现象。
The ancient Greeks did not fully understand precession. = 古希腊人并没有完全理解岁差。



PHRASE->

axial precession: 自转轴进动
equinoctial precession: 分点岁差
lunar precession: 月球岁差
solar precession: 太阳岁差
precession of the equinoxes: 分点岁差


词源:

The word "precession" comes from the Latin word "praecessio," meaning "a going before" or "a preceding." This refers to the way the Earth's axis appears to precede or lead the stars in its slow, cyclical movement.
