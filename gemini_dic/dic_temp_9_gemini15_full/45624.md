词源:
The word "cursednesses" is derived from the adjective "cursed," which itself originates from the past participle of the verb "curse."  "Curse" ultimately comes from the Old English word *cursian, meaning "to invoke a curse upon." The suffix "-ness" is a common English noun suffix denoting a state, quality, or condition.  Therefore, "cursednesses" signifies the state or condition of being subjected to numerous curses or misfortunes.
