The word "flender" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide an analysis in the requested format.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a very niche dialect, or a proper noun.  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more informed guess.
