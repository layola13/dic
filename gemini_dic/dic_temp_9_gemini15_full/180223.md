refraction:/rɪˈfrækʃən/| n. |折射，屈光|The bending of a wave as it passes from one medium to another.  This change in direction is caused by a change in the wave's speed. Examples include the bending of light as it enters water, or the bending of sound waves as they pass through different layers of the atmosphere. |Example: The refraction of light through a prism creates a rainbow.  折射光线通过棱镜会产生彩虹。|近义词：deflection, bending |反义词：reflection (in some contexts)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Light refraction occurs when light passes from one medium to another. 光的折射发生在光线从一种介质传播到另一种介质时。
The prism demonstrates the principle of light refraction. 棱镜演示了光的折射原理。


一般过去时:
Scientists observed the refraction of light in their experiment. 科学家们在实验中观察到了光的折射。
The lens refracted the light, focusing it onto the film. 透镜折射了光线，将其聚焦到胶片上。


现在完成时:
Researchers have studied light refraction for centuries. 研究人员已经研究了几个世纪的光的折射。
We have observed how refraction affects image formation. 我们已经观察到折射如何影响图像的形成。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had calculated the expected light refraction. 在实验之前，他们已经计算出预期的光折射。
The scientists had already understood the principles of refraction before they conducted the experiment. 科学家们在进行实验之前就已经了解了折射的原理。


将来时:
The new telescope will use advanced techniques to minimize light refraction. 新的望远镜将使用先进的技术来最大限度地减少光的折射。
They will study how refraction impacts underwater visibility. 他们将研究折射如何影响水下能见度。


虚拟语气:
If the light were not refracted, we would not see this phenomenon. 如果光线没有被折射，我们就不会看到这种现象。
I wish I had understood refraction better in high school. 我真希望我在高中时能更好地理解折射。


被动语态:
Light is refracted when it passes through a lens. 光线通过透镜时会被折射。
The image was distorted due to refraction. 图像由于折射而变形。


疑问句:
How does refraction affect the apparent depth of an object in water? 折射如何影响物体在水中的视深？
What causes refraction of light? 什么导致光的折射？


否定句:
The light was not refracted significantly. 光线没有发生明显的折射。
The experiment did not demonstrate refraction effectively. 实验没有有效地演示折射。


PHRASE->
