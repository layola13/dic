PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "nonignominiously" due to its infrequent use.  The word itself functions as a standalone adverb.


词源:
The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), and the adjective "ignominious" (meaning "causing or deserving disgrace or shame").  Therefore, "nonignominiously" literally means "not disgracefully" or "without disgrace."
