词源:  The word "disincentivize" is a relatively modern coinage, formed by adding the negative prefix "dis-" to "incentivize."  "Incentivize" itself is derived from "incentive," which comes from the Latin word "incentivus," meaning "inciting, urging on."  The "-ize" suffix transforms the noun "incentive" into a verb.
