The word "prediscourages" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  If it was intended to be a word, it would likely be a combination of "pre-" and "discourage," creating a word meaning "to discourage beforehand" or "to make something less likely to happen in advance."  Since it's not a recognized word, we cannot provide a full analysis as requested.  To help me assist you, please provide the correct spelling of the word you intended to analyze.
