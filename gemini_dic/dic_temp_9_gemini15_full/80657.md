USAGE->
This section is inapplicable to a proper noun like "Gorbachev".  Proper nouns don't conjugate like verbs or have tenses.  They are simply names.


PHRASE->
This section is also inapplicable.  Phrases are combinations of words;  "Gorbachev" itself does not typically combine with other words to form common phrases in the way that, for example, "what" does.  One might use "Gorbachev era" or "Gorbachev reforms"  as phrases, but these are descriptive and not inherent to the name itself.
