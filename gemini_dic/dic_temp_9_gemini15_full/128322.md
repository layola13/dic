neurotransmitter:/ˌnʊroʊtrænzˈmɪtər/| n. |神经递质|A neurotransmitter is a chemical messenger that carries signals across a synapse (the gap between two nerve cells) in the nervous system.  Neurotransmitters are released from the axon terminal of a neuron and bind to receptors on the dendrite of another neuron, triggering a response. This process is fundamental to communication within the brain and throughout the body, influencing a wide range of physiological and psychological functions. | Example: Dopamine is a neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward. 多巴胺是一种与快乐和奖励相关的神经递质。
