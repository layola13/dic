WORD ORIGIN->

The word "precociousnesses" is derived from the adjective "precocious," which comes from the late Middle English word "precoce," borrowed from the Old French "preçoce," and ultimately from the Latin "praecox," meaning "early ripe" or "premature."  The suffix "-ness" is added to form the noun "precociousness," signifying the state or quality of being precocious.  Adding "-es" creates the plural form.
