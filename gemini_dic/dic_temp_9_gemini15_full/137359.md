/ˌnɒnˌtiːtʃəˈbɪlnɪsɪz/ | n. | 不可教性；难以教导的事物 | The inherent difficulties in teaching certain concepts are often referred to as nonteachablenesses.  一些概念在教学中固有的困难之处通常被称为不可教性。 | 近义词：unlearnableness, intractability | 反义词：teachability


This word is not commonly used.  It's a relatively rare and complex word formed by combining several morphemes.  Let's break down its formation:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of."
* **teach-**: The root word related to the verb "to teach."
* **-able**: A suffix meaning "capable of being" or "suitable for."
* **-ness**: A suffix turning an adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality.
* **-es**: A plural suffix.

Therefore, "nonteachablenesses" refers to the plural of qualities or states that are not capable of being taught. This could refer to concepts, skills, or aspects of a subject that are inherently difficult or impossible to teach, perhaps due to limitations in the learner, the teaching method, or the subject matter itself.


Since it's an uncommon word, providing detailed grammatical examples across tenses and moods is impractical.  The word itself functions as a noun and would be used in sentences similar to the example provided above.  The grammatical constructions would follow standard English rules for plural nouns.  For example:

* **Simple Present:**  The study explored several nonteachablenesses in advanced mathematics. (这项研究探讨了高等数学中一些不可教的方面。)

* **Simple Past:**  The teacher recognized the nonteachablenesses inherent in the curriculum. (老师认识到课程中固有的不可教性。)

* **Future Tense:**  Researchers will investigate the potential nonteachablenesses of emotional intelligence. (研究人员将调查情商潜在的不可教性。)
