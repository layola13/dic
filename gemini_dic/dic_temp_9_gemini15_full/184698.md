resublimates:/ˌriːˈsʌblɪmeɪts/ | v. |再升华；重新升华|To sublime again; to undergo sublimation a second time. This term refers to the process where a solid transitions directly to a gas, and then back to a solid, skipping the liquid phase.  | Example:  The iodine resublimated after being heated and then cooled. 碘加热后再冷却后再次升华。 |近义词：sublime (again) | 反义词：melt, liquefy


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The iodine resublimates under these conditions. = 碘在这种条件下会再升华。
The chemist resublimates the compound to purify it. = 化学家使该化合物再升华以提纯它。


一般过去时:
The substance resublimated quickly after the temperature dropped. = 物质温度下降后迅速再次升华。
The experiment showed that the compound resublimated at a lower temperature than expected. = 实验表明，该化合物在比预期更低的温度下再次升华。


现在完成时:
The iodine has resublimated onto the cold surface. = 碘已经再次升华到冷表面上。
The scientist has resublimated the sample multiple times for analysis. = 科学家已经多次使样品再次升华以进行分析。


过去完成时:
The material had resublimated before the analysis could be completed. = 在分析完成之前，物质已经再次升华了。
The researchers had resublimated the compound several times before obtaining pure crystals. = 研究人员在获得纯净晶体之前已经对该化合物进行了多次再升华。


将来时:
The compound will resublimate if the temperature is lowered sufficiently. = 如果温度降低到足够低，该化合物将会再次升华。
The experiment will demonstrate how the substance resublimates under controlled conditions. = 实验将演示该物质在受控条件下如何再次升华。


虚拟语气:
If the pressure were lower, the substance would resublimate more readily. = 如果压力更低，物质会更容易再次升华。

疑问句:
Does the compound resublimate easily? = 该化合物容易再次升华吗？
Will the process resublimate all the material? = 此过程会使所有物质都再次升华吗？


否定句:
The substance did not resublimate under those conditions. = 在那种条件下，物质没有再次升华。
The experiment failed because the compound did not resublimate effectively. = 实验失败了，因为该化合物没有有效地再次升华。
