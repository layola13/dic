词源:

The word "hyperarousal" is a modern compound word.  It combines "hyper-" (from Greek ὑπέρ, *hupér*, meaning "over," "above," "beyond") with "arousal," which itself comes from the verb "arouse," meaning to awaken or stimulate.  Therefore, "hyperarousal" literally means "excessive arousal" or "over-stimulation."
