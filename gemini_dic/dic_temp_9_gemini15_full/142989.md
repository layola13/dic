词源:
The word "outbartered" is formed by adding the prefix "out-" (meaning to surpass or exceed) to the verb "bartered" (from "barter," meaning to exchange goods or services without using money).  It implies a negative outcome, suggesting that someone was outmaneuvered or got a worse deal in a bargaining situation.
