词源:
The word "saw" as a verb comes from Old English *sāwon, the past tense of *seon "to see".  As a noun (referring to the tool), it comes from Old English *saga, related to Old Norse *saga "saying" (referencing the sawing action creating a sound).  The two words, despite their shared spelling, have distinct etymologies.
