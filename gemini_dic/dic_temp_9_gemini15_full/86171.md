The term "heartstring" is a metaphorical extension of the literal strings of a musical instrument.  The implication is that emotions, like the strings of a heart, can be vibrated or "pulled" to create a feeling or response.  The exact origin is difficult to pinpoint, but the usage reflects the long-standing association between music and emotion.
