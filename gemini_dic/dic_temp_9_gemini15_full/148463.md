词源:

* **over-**:  Prefix indicating "excessive" or "too much".
* **strain**: From Old French "estreindre," meaning "to bind tightly," "constrict," or "squeeze."  Ultimately derived from Latin "stringere," with the same basic meaning.  The word "strain" itself has evolved to encompass both physical and mental tension.
