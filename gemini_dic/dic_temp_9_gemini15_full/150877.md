The word "parail" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis according to the requested format.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
2. **It's a technical term:** It might be specific to a particular field or dialect. If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it might be possible to identify its meaning.
3. **It's a newly coined word:**  New words are created all the time, but without further information, it's impossible to analyze it.

Please provide more information so I can assist you properly.
