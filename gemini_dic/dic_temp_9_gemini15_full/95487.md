词源:  The word "inclaudent" is a relatively rare word, not found in standard dictionaries. It seems to be a newly coined word formed by combining "in-" (meaning "in" or "into") and a word related to "claudere" (Latin for "to close, shut, enclose").  The intended meaning suggests "containing" or "encompassing."  Its usage should be approached cautiously as its lack of established usage may lead to misinterpretations.
