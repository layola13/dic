The word "reice" is not a word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  If you can provide the intended word, I can give you the analysis.
* **It's a proper noun or a very rare/technical term:** If it's a proper noun (a name, place, etc.), or a term used only in a specific field, you will need to provide more context.
* **It's a newly coined word:**  If it's a newly invented word, then an analysis would depend on its intended meaning and usage.


Please provide the correct spelling or more context so I can assist you.
