词源:
The word "professionalizing" is derived from the noun "profession" and the suffix "-izing," which indicates the process of making something into a profession.  "Profession" ultimately comes from the Latin word "professio," meaning "declaration," "avowal," or "open expression of belief."  The sense of a specialized occupation developed over time.
