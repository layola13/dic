diffracted:/dɪˈfræktɪd/| adj.|衍射的；绕射的|Past participle of diffract.  Describes waves (light, sound, etc.) that have been bent or spread out after passing around an obstacle or through a narrow opening.  This bending is due to interference between different parts of the wave.|例句：The light was diffracted by the narrow slit, creating an interference pattern. 光线被狭缝衍射，产生了干涉图样。
The sound waves were diffracted around the corner of the building. 声波绕过建筑物的拐角发生衍射。|近义词：bent, spread, scattered|反义词：unbent, focused, concentrated


Etymology:  From the verb "diffract," which comes from the Latin prefix "dis-" (apart) + "fractus" (broken), referring to the breaking up or bending of waves.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The light is diffracted by the prism. = 光线被棱镜衍射。
The sound is diffracted around the obstacle. = 声波绕过障碍物发生衍射。


一般过去时:
