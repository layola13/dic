词源:

The word "precompasses" is a relatively modern coinage,  formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") with "compasses," which in this context refers not to the navigational instrument, but to the act of encompassing or thoroughly considering something.  It essentially means "to encompass beforehand" or "to plan comprehensively in advance."  The word is not found in standard dictionaries but is understandable from its constituent parts.
