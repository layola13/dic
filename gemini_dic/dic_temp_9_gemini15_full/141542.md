词源:
The word "opportunistic" is derived from the word "opportunity" (itself coming from Old French "oportunite" and ultimately from Latin "opportunitas"),  combined with the suffix "-istic," indicating a characteristic or nature of something.  Therefore, "opportunistic" literally means "relating to or characterized by the taking of opportunities."
