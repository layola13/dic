convection:/kənˈvɛkʃən/ | n. | 对流，传送 | The transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid, such as air or water.  This process involves the movement of heated particles from one place to another. | Example:  Heat from the sun causes convection currents in the atmosphere. 太阳的热量导致大气中的对流。  The convection oven cooks food more evenly. 对流烤箱使食物烹饪更均匀。 |近义词：circulation, transmission | 反义词：conduction, radiation | 名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Convection currents circulate heat throughout the room. = 对流气流使热量在整个房间循环。
The chef uses convection to cook the food quickly. = 厨师利用对流快速烹制食物。

一般过去时:
Convection currents moved the warm air upward. = 对流气流使暖空气上升。
The experiment demonstrated the principles of convection. = 实验演示了对流的原理。

现在完成时:
Scientists have studied convection for centuries. = 科学家们已经研究对流几个世纪了。
We have observed significant convection patterns in the data. = 我们在数据中观察到显著的对流模式。

过去完成时:
The air had already begun to circulate via convection before the heater was turned on. = 在加热器打开之前，空气已经通过对流开始循环了。
They had understood the importance of convection in weather patterns. = 他们已经了解到对流在天气模式中的重要性。

将来时:
The new system will use convection to cool the components. = 新系统将使用对流来冷却组件。
We will study the effects of convection on cloud formation. = 我们将研究对流对云形成的影响。

虚拟语气:
If there were no convection, the heat would not distribute evenly. = 如果没有对流，热量就不会均匀分布。
I wish I understood convection better. = 我希望我更了解对流。

被动语态:
Heat is transferred by convection. = 热量通过对流传递。
The experiment was designed to measure convection rates. = 该实验旨在测量对流速率。

疑问句:
How does convection work? = 对流是如何工作的？
What are the different types of convection? = 对流有哪些不同的类型？

否定句:
Convection does not occur in a vacuum. = 真空中不会发生对流。
The experiment did not show significant convection effects. = 实验没有显示明显的对流效应。


PHRASE->
forced convection = 强制对流
natural convection = 自然对流
convection current = 对流电流
convection oven = 对流烤箱
convective heat transfer = 对流传热
