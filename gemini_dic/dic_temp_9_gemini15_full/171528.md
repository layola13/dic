词源:

The word "pukka" originated in Hindi, where it means "ripe," "cooked," or "firm."  Its use in English developed during the British Raj in India, where it initially referred to something genuine or authentic, particularly of high quality. Over time, it broadened to mean simply "excellent" or "first-rate," often with a slightly informal or humorous connotation.
