词源:The word "red-faced" is a compound adjective formed from the adjective "red" and the noun "faced."  "Red" describes the color of the face, and "faced" is an adjective referring to the face itself.  The combination describes a person with a red face.  The etymology of "red" traces back to Proto-Germanic *raudz and ultimately to Proto-Indo-European *rudh-, meaning "red."  The etymology of "face" traces back to Old English *fǣs,  related to Old High German *faz and Latin *facies.
