The word "micalike" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a breakdown following your requested format.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or fictional vocabulary.  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer a more helpful response.
