isotrimorphic: /ˌaɪsoʊtrɪˈmɔːrfɪk/ | adj. | 同晶型的 |  Isotrimorphic refers to substances that crystallize in the same form, even though their chemical compositions might differ.  It describes a relationship between different chemical compounds that exhibit identical crystal structures.  The term highlights the similarity in crystallographic form despite variations in chemical makeup. | The minerals calcite, dolomite, and siderite are isotrimorphic, all crystallizing in the rhombohedral system. | 近义词: isomorphous (often used interchangeably, but isotrimorphic specifically emphasizes crystal form) | 反义词: allotropic (different crystal forms for the same element), polymorphous (different crystal forms for the same compound)


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in mineralogy and crystallography, and doesn't have typical verb conjugations or phrasal variations like "what" does.  Therefore, standard grammatical tenses and structures are not applicable.  Examples would focus on describing substances' properties.

Example 1:
The three minerals exhibit isotrimorphic relationships, despite their varying chemical compositions. = 这三种矿物表现出同晶型关系，尽管它们的化学成分不同。

Example 2:
Isotrimorphic substitution in the mineral structure can lead to variations in physical properties. = 矿物结构中的同晶型替代会导致物理性质的变化。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "isotrimorphic."  The term is highly specialized.
