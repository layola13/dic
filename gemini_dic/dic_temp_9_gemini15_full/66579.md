词源:
源自拉丁语 *exhortārī  "to encourage, urge,"  from ex- "out, forth" + hortārī "to encourage," from hortus "garden," in the sense of "to cultivate,"  related to  hortus "garden" (in sense of cultivating).  The connection between "garden" and "encourage" is somewhat obscure, but might involve the idea of nurturing and fostering growth.
