词源:

The word "moonshiny" is derived from "moon" + "-shiny,"  combining the imagery of the moon with the descriptive suffix "-shiny" which indicates a lustrous or reflective quality.  The semantic shift towards vagueness and unreality likely arose from the association of moonlight with dreaminess and illusion.
