chemosynthesis:/ˌkiːmoʊˈsɪnθəsɪs/| n. |化能合成|The process by which certain organisms, such as bacteria, use chemical energy to produce organic compounds from inorganic substances, rather than using sunlight as in photosynthesis.  This process typically occurs in environments lacking sunlight, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents. |Example: Chemosynthesis is crucial for supporting life in deep-sea ecosystems where sunlight cannot penetrate.|近义词:autotrophy(自养)|反义词:photosynthesis(光合作用)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Chemosynthesis occurs in deep-sea vents. = 化能合成发生在深海热液喷口。
Bacteria perform chemosynthesis to obtain energy. = 细菌进行化能合成以获取能量。


一般过去时:
Scientists discovered chemosynthesis in the 1970s. = 科学家在20世纪70年代发现了化能合成。
The experiment demonstrated the process of chemosynthesis. = 实验展示了化能合成的过程。


现在完成时:
