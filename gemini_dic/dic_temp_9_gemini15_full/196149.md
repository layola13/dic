词源:
From Latin *septifer, from septem "seven" + ferre "to bear, carry".  The original meaning likely related to carrying seven things (possibly diseases), although this connection to the modern meaning is tenuous and more likely a folk etymology. The current meaning developed through association with decay and infection.
