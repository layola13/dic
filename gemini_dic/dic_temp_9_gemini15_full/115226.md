词源:
The word "manifoldly" is derived from the word "manifold," which itself comes from the Old French "manifolde" and ultimately from the Latin "multus" (many) + "plicare" (to fold).  The original sense was of something having many folds or layers, hence numerous parts or aspects.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective "manifold" into an adverb.
