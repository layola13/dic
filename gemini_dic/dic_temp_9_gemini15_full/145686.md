/ˌoʊvərˈkoʊpiəsˌnɛsɪz/ | n. | 过量；过多；过剩 | The overcopiousnesses of the feast left many guests feeling unwell.  盛宴的过度丰盛让许多宾客感到不适。 | 近义词：excess, superfluity, abundance | 反义词：scarcity, deficiency, lack | 名词


The word "overcopiousnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a highly unusual and artificial formation, likely created by adding the prefix "over-" and the suffix "-nesses" to "copious," which itself means abundant or plentiful.  The "-nesses" suffix is used to create a plural noun of abstract qualities, but the combination results in a word that is grammatically correct but semantically awkward and rarely, if ever, used in everyday conversation or writing.


Therefore, there are no standard usages, examples in typical grammatical structures (present, past, future tense, passive voice, etc.), or common phrases associated with "overcopiousnesses".  The word is essentially a neologism with no established meaning beyond its literal, cumbersome construction.  To express the idea of excessive abundance, simpler and more natural alternatives are strongly preferred.


Instead of using "overcopiousnesses," consider alternatives like:

* **Excess:**  This is a straightforward and common word for more than is needed.
* **Superfluity:** This word suggests an overabundance of something unnecessary.
* **Surfeit:** This implies an excessive amount, often leading to discomfort.
* **Profusion:** This describes a large or abundant quantity.
* **Overabundance:** A clear and direct way to describe too much of something.


Example using a suitable alternative:

The *excess* of food at the wedding left many guests with leftovers.  婚礼上过多的食物让许多宾客都剩下了吃不完的食物。
