WORD ORIGIN->

The word "destructibleness" is derived from the verb "destroy" and the suffix "-ible," meaning "capable of being," and finally the noun-forming suffix "-ness," indicating a state or quality.  Tracing it further:

* **destroy:** From Old French *destruire* and ultimately from Latin *destruere*  (to pull down, overthrow, destroy), from *de-* (down) + *struere* (to build, pile up).

Therefore, "destructibleness" literally means "the quality of being capable of being destroyed."
