ischuretic: /ˌɪʃʊˈrɛtɪk/ | adj. | 抑制尿液的，利尿药的 |  An ischuretic is an agent that suppresses or diminishes the flow of urine.  It refers to substances or medications that have a diuretic effect, but in a context where reduced urine output is the desired outcome (unlike typical diuretics which increase urine output). This is often used in specific medical contexts, and the term might be less frequently encountered in everyday language.  The word is less common than its antonym, diuretic. |  The medication had an ischuretic effect, reducing urine production. = 这种药物具有抑尿作用，减少了尿液的产生。


There are no common phrases using "ischuretic".  The word itself is rarely used outside of specialized medical contexts.

There are no easily identifiable synonyms or antonyms in common usage.  While "antidiuretic" is a near antonym, representing the opposite effect of a diuretic, it is not a direct synonym of "ischuretic".  A more precise antonym would be a "diuretic".  However, given its medical context, direct synonyms or antonyms in everyday language are limited.

The word's usage is confined primarily to medical terminology and might appear in scientific papers, medical reports, or pharmaceutical descriptions. It does not lend itself to everyday conversation or common English sentence structures in the way that more frequently used words do.  Because of this highly specific usage, providing examples across various grammatical tenses is impractical and would create artificial examples.
