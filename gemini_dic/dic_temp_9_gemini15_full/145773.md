词源:
The word "overdaintily" is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to a degree exceeding what is considered normal) and "daintily" (meaning delicately or with refined elegance).  "Daintily" itself derives from the Middle English word "deinte," meaning "delicacy" or "daintiness," ultimately tracing back to Old French "daint," meaning "fine," "choice," or "delightful."
