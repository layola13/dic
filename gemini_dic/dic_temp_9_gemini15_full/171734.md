词源:
The word "pumpernickel" is of uncertain origin, but most etymologists believe it to be a combination of  German words, possibly "pumpen" (to pump) and "nickel" (referring to the small, hard grains).  The "pumpen" part might refer to the process of kneading the dough or the resulting texture. The exact meaning and evolution of the word remain a subject of debate.
