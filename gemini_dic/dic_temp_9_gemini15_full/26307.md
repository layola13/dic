词源:
The word "buxom" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "buxom," meaning "pliant," "obedient," or "yielding."  This, in turn, comes from Old English "būgsum," where "būg" means "bow" or "bend," and "sum" indicates "ready" or "inclined."  The modern meaning of "buxom" shifted over time, evolving from a sense of pliability and compliance to a description of a full-figured physique, perhaps due to the association of a yielding body with a healthy, well-developed one.
