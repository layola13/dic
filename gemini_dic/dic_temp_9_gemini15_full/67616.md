词源:
The word "extravertive" is derived from the term "extroversion," coined by Carl Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist and psychoanalyst.  "Extra" means "outside" or "beyond," and "vertere" (Latin) means "to turn."  Thus, extroversion implies a turning outward, a focus on the external world.  The "-ive" suffix turns the noun into an adjective.
