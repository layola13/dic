nonprobability:/ˌnɒnˌprɒbəˈbɪləti/| n. |非概率性；非概率样本|The lack of random selection renders the survey results lacking in nonprobability.  缺乏随机抽样使得调查结果缺乏非概率性。|近义词：nonrandomness|反义词：probability

英文解析:Nonprobability refers to sampling methods where not all members of the population have an equal chance of being selected.  This contrasts with probability sampling, where each member has a known, non-zero probability of inclusion. Nonprobability samples are often used in exploratory research or when it's impractical to obtain a probability sample.  However, results from nonprobability samples cannot be generalized to the larger population with the same confidence as results from probability samples.

例句:

The researcher used a nonprobability sample, specifically a convenience sample, to gather data quickly. 研究人员使用了非概率样本，特别是便利样本，以便快速收集数据。


Because of the nonprobability nature of the data, the findings are not generalizable to the entire population. 由于数据的非概率性，其结果不能推广到整个人群。
