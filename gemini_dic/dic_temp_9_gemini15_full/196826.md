词源:  The word "sexualizes" comes from the noun "sex" (meaning the state of being male or female) combined with the suffix "-alize," meaning "to make or become."  The "-ize" suffix is of Greek origin and indicates to make or cause something to be.  Therefore, "sexualizes" means "to make something sexual in nature."
