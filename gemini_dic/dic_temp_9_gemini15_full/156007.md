photolabile:/ˌfoʊtoʊˈleɪbəl/ | adj. |见光分解的，光敏的 |Sensitive to light; decomposing or changing when exposed to light.  Photolabile substances are prone to degradation upon exposure to light, often undergoing chemical changes that alter their properties. | Example:  Many drugs are photolabile and should be stored in dark containers.  许多药物见光分解，应储存在黑暗的容器中。 |近义词：light-sensitive, photosensitive |反义词：photostable
