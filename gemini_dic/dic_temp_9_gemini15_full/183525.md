It implies a higher level of purity than the initial purification.  The term is less common than "purification" and often used in specialized contexts like chemistry or metallurgy. | Example: The repurifications of the rare earth elements were necessary to achieve the required level of purity for the advanced semiconductor fabrication.  再次纯化稀土元素对于实现高级半导体制造所需的纯度水平是必要的。|近义词:  re-purification, further purification, additional purification |反义词: contamination, pollution
