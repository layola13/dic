词源:

The word is derived from the adjective "displeasing," which itself comes from the verb "displease."  "Dis-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of," while "pleasing" comes from the verb "please," ultimately from Old French "plaisir" (pleasure).  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality.  The "-es" adds the plural marker.
