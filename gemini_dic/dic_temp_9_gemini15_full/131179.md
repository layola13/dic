nonbroodings: /ˌnɒnˈbruːdɪŋz/ | adj. | 不忧郁的，无忧无虑的 |  This word is not a standard English word. It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) formed by adding the prefix "non-" to "broodings," which itself is not a common noun but rather a gerund form of "brood."  The intended meaning is the opposite of brooding, suggesting a lack of worry, anxiety, or deep thought. There's no established dictionary definition or common usage.  Because of this, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage is not possible in a meaningful way.  The word needs context to understand its intended application.
