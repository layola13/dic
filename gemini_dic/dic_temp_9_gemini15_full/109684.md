leucosphere:/ˈluːkəsfɪər/| n. |白球层，白质层|The leucosphere is the outermost layer of the Earth's mantle, characterized by its relatively low density and light color due to the presence of felsic minerals.  It's a zone of relatively low seismic velocity.|The study focused on the structure and composition of the Earth's leucosphere.|近义词:upper mantle (partially)|反义词:mesosphere, asthenosphere


USAGE->
