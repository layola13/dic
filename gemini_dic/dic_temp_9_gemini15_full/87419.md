hertz:/hɜːrts/| n. |赫兹|赫兹是频率的单位，表示每秒的周期数。它用于测量波，例如声波和电磁波的频率。  The term is named after Heinrich Hertz, a German physicist who made significant contributions to the study of electromagnetism. |The radio station broadcasts at 98.5 Hertz.|近义词：cycle per second (cps)|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The radio signal operates at 100 hertz. = 收音机信号以100赫兹运行。
This machine vibrates at a frequency of 50 hertz. = 这台机器以50赫兹的频率振动。

一般过去时:
The old equipment operated at a lower hertz. = 旧设备以较低的赫兹运行。
The sound wave had a frequency of 20 hertz. = 声波的频率为20赫兹。

现在完成时:
Scientists have measured frequencies up to millions of hertz. = 科学家已经测量了高达数百万赫兹的频率。
Engineers have developed circuits that operate at gigahertz frequencies. = 工程师们已经开发出以吉赫兹频率运行的电路。

过去完成时:
Before the upgrade, the system had only operated at a few kilohertz. = 在升级之前，系统只以几千赫兹的频率运行。
They had already tested the device at various hertz ranges before the final launch. = 他们在最终发布之前已经测试了该设备在各个赫兹范围内的性能。

将来时:
The new technology will operate at higher hertz. = 新技术将以更高的赫兹运行。
We will measure the frequency in hertz. = 我们将以赫兹为单位测量频率。


虚拟语气:
If the frequency were higher, the signal would be clearer. = 如果频率更高，信号就会更清晰。
I wish the audio output were at a lower hertz. = 我希望音频输出在较低的赫兹。

被动语态:
The frequency is measured in hertz. = 频率以赫兹为单位测量。
The signal was transmitted at 1000 hertz. = 信号以1000赫兹的频率传输。

疑问句:
What is the hertz of this sound wave? = 这个声波的频率是多少赫兹？
At what hertz does this device operate? = 这台设备以多少赫兹运行？

否定句:
The signal was not transmitted at the correct hertz. = 信号没有以正确的赫兹传输。
This device does not operate at such high hertz. = 这台设备不能在这么高的赫兹下运行。


PHRASE->
kilohertz (kHz): 千赫兹
megahertz (MHz): 兆赫兹
