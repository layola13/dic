peptonize:/ˈpɛptənaɪz/| vt.| 蛋白质消化；使成蛋白胨 | To convert (a substance, especially protein) into peptones by enzymatic hydrolysis.  Peptonization is a process of protein digestion, often using enzymes like pepsin or trypsin. The resulting peptones are simpler, more easily absorbed forms of protein. | Example: The enzyme pepsin peptonizes proteins in the stomach.  酶胃蛋白酶在胃中使蛋白质水解成蛋白胨。|近义词：digest, hydrolyze|反义词：synthesize


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The enzyme peptonizes proteins. = 这种酶使蛋白质水解成蛋白胨。
She peptonizes the milk for her baby. = 她把牛奶分解成蛋白胨给她的婴儿喝。


一般过去时:
The doctor peptonized the food for the patient. = 医生把食物分解成蛋白胨给病人吃。
They peptonized the solution before analysis. = 他们在分析前将溶液进行蛋白胨化处理。


现在完成时:
The lab has peptonized all the samples. = 实验室已经将所有样品进行了蛋白胨化处理。
She has peptonized the milk several times. = 她已经多次将牛奶分解成蛋白胨。


过去完成时:
The experiment had peptonized the proteins before the reaction. = 实验在反应之前已经将蛋白质水解成蛋白胨。
They had peptonized the food for the infant. = 他们已经将婴儿的食物分解成蛋白胨。


将来时:
The scientists will peptonize the cells for further study. = 科学家们将对细胞进行蛋白胨化处理以便进一步研究。
We will peptonize the mixture tomorrow. = 我们明天将对混合物进行蛋白胨化处理。


虚拟语气:
If we peptonized the solution, the results would be different. = 如果我们对溶液进行蛋白胨化处理，结果将会不同。
I wish I had peptonized the milk earlier. = 我希望我早点把牛奶分解成蛋白胨。


被动语态:
The proteins were peptonized by the enzyme. = 蛋白质被酶分解成蛋白胨。
The food was peptonized for easy digestion. = 食物被分解成蛋白胨以便于消化。


疑问句:
Was the solution peptonized properly? = 溶液是否被正确地进行了蛋白胨化处理？
Have they peptonized the samples yet? = 他们已经对样品进行蛋白胨化处理了吗？


否定句:
The enzyme did not peptonize the proteins completely. = 这种酶并没有完全将蛋白质分解成蛋白胨。
They didn't peptonize the milk before feeding the baby. = 他们在给婴儿喂奶之前没有将牛奶分解成蛋白胨。
