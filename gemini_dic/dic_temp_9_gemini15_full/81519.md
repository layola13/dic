词源:  The word "gravimeter" is a combination of "gravity" and the suffix "-meter," which is a combining form indicating an instrument for measuring something.  "Gravity" comes from the Latin word "gravitas," meaning "weight" or "heaviness."  Therefore, "gravimeter" literally means "an instrument for measuring gravity."
