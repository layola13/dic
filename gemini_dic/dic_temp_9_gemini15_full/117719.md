词源:
The word "melancholy" ultimately derives from the Greek words  μέλας (mélas), meaning "black," and χολή (kholḗ), meaning "bile." In ancient Greek medicine, melancholy was believed to be caused by an imbalance of black bile in the body, one of the four humors.  The word evolved through Old French *melangolie* and Middle English *melancolie*.
