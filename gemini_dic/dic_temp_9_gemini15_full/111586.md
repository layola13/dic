lobotomize:/ləˈbɑːtəmaɪz/ | vt. | 脑白质切除术；切除脑前额叶 | To perform a lobotomy on (someone).  This surgical procedure involves severing connections in the brain's prefrontal cortex, historically used to treat mental illness, but now largely considered outdated and unethical due to its significant side effects. | Example: The patient was lobotomized in an attempt to alleviate his severe depression.  病人接受了脑白质切除术以试图减轻他的严重抑郁症。


近义词：  (There isn't a perfect synonym, as the procedure is specific.  Related terms might describe the goal, not the method):  to treat (mentally ill patients), to incapacitate (though this is a negative connotation)


反义词： (No direct antonym exists.  The opposite would be to *not* perform a lobotomy or to employ alternative, more ethical treatment methods.)
