**(词源):** The word "chopchurch" is a relatively rare and informal word.  Its etymology is not extensively documented, but it seems to be a descriptive compound word combining "chop" (implying something small, roughly made, or cut down) and "church".  The "chop" element likely contributes to its connotation of a small, simple, or perhaps even makeshift religious structure.
