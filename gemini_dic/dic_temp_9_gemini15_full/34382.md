词源:
The word "classified" comes from the verb "classify," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "classis," meaning "class" or "group."  The suffix "-ify" indicates the act of making something into a class or category.  The addition of "-ed" makes it the past participle form, functioning as an adjective.
