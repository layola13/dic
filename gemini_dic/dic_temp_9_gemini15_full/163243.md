preconcentrates:/ˌpriːˈkɒnsənˌtreɪts/ | v. |预浓缩；预富集 | To increase the concentration of (a substance) before further analysis or processing.  This is often done to improve detection limits or to remove interfering substances. | Example: The sample was preconcentrated before gas chromatography analysis. 样品在气相色谱分析前进行了预浓缩。|近义词：concentrate, enrich |反义词：dilute
