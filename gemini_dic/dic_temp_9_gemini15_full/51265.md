词源:
Desuetude comes from the Old French word *desuet*, meaning "disused," which in turn derives from the Latin *desuetus*, the past participle of *desuēscere*, meaning "to fall out of use" or "to become unaccustomed."  The suffix *-ude* is a common noun-forming suffix in English, indicating a state or condition.
