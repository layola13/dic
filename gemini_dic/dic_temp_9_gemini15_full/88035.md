词源:  The term "highbrow" emerged in the early 20th century, likely originating as a metaphorical description. The "brow" refers to the forehead, and a "high brow" suggests a superior intellectual capacity or refined taste.  The term's initial usage often carried a slightly condescending or satirical tone, highlighting the perceived elitism associated with high culture.

A positive usage might emphasize the quality and depth of the subject matter, while a negative usage might suggest pretentiousness or elitism.
