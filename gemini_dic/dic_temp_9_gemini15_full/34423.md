Etymology:

The name "Claudius" is of Roman origin. It derives from the Roman family name *Claudius*, which is believed to be derived from the Latin word *claudus*, meaning "lame" or "limping".  While the exact origin of the family name is debated, the connection to *claudus* is widely accepted, and it's thought that the name may have originally been a nickname given to an ancestor who had a limp.  Over time, it became a prominent Roman gens (clan) name, eventually associated with emperors and other important figures.
