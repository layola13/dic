词源:
The word "overtheatrical" is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or too much) and "theatrical" (relating to the theater or drama).  "Theatrical" itself comes from the Middle English word "theatrical," ultimately derived from the Late Latin word "theatralis," from "theatrum" (theater), which itself is from the Greek word "θέατρον" (théatron), meaning "place for viewing."
