词源:  The word "rhapsodizing" comes from the noun "rhapsody," which has its roots in the Ancient Greek word "rhapsōidós," meaning "stitcher of songs."  In ancient Greece, a rhapsode was a professional performer who recited epic poems, often improvising and embellishing the stories.  The word thus carries connotations of passionate, often improvised, and sometimes somewhat disorganized speech or writing.
