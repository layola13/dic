词源:
Derived from the adjective "frugal," meaning sparing or economical in the use of something.  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb.  "Frugal" itself ultimately traces back to the Latin word "frugi," meaning "fruitful," "useful," or "profitable," implying a wise and productive use of resources.
