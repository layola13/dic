词源:
The word "pall" in this sense ultimately derives from Old French "paller," meaning "to grow pale," "to become dull," or "to fade."  This is connected to the idea that something losing its appeal also loses its vibrancy or color.  The modern sense of "to lose interest" evolved from the older meaning.
