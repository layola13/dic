词源：The word "chivalric" derives from the Old French word "chevalerie," meaning "horsemanship," "knighthood," or "chivalry."  This, in turn, originates from the Medieval Latin word "caballarius," meaning "horseman," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "caballus," meaning "horse."  The evolution reflects the historical association of knighthood with horsemanship and the military skills required of knights.
