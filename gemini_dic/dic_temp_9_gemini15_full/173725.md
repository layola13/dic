PHRASE->
There is no common phrase specifically using "quasi-mutual".  The term itself functions as a descriptive adjective.  However, it can be used in phrases like:


quasi-mutual agreement: 准互惠协议
quasi-mutual relationship: 准互惠关系
quasi-mutual benefits: 准互惠利益
quasi-mutual exchange: 准互惠交换
quasi-mutual understanding: 准互惠理解


词源:
The word is a combination of "quasi" (from Latin, meaning "as if," "seemingly," or "almost") and "mutual" (from Latin *mutuus, meaning "interchanged," "reciprocal").  Therefore, "quasi-mutual" literally means "almost mutual" or "seemingly mutual."
