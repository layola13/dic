overlustinesses:/ˌoʊvərˈlʌstɪnɪsiz/| n. |过度放纵；过分热情；过度的兴奋|The word "overlustinesses" is not a standard word in English.  It's a rare and unusual formation, likely created by adding the suffix "-nesses" (indicating a plural of abstract qualities) to "overlustiness," which itself is not a common word.  It implies excessive instances of lust or excessive enthusiasm to an excessive degree. The word is likely to be found only in very specific contexts or literary works.  There's no direct equivalent single word in most dictionaries.|例句：His overlustinesses led to his downfall. (他的过度放纵导致了他的垮台).  This sentence uses the word for illustrative purposes, but the word itself is unusual and might sound unnatural in many contexts.|近义词: excesses, overindulgences, immoderations |反义词: restraint, moderation, temperance |名词
