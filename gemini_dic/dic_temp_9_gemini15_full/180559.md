词源:
The word "regimenting" comes from the noun "regiment," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "regiment," meaning "rule, government."  The French word itself comes from the Latin word "regimen," which means "rule, system, or manner of living."  The military use of the word emerged later, referring to a body of soldiers.  The verb form, "regimenting," developed from this, carrying the sense of strict organization and control.
