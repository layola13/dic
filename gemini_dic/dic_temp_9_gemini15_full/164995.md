preheals: /ˌpriːˈhiːlz/ | v. | 预先治愈；提前治愈 |  There is no standard English word "preheals". It seems to be a neologism, a newly coined word,  possibly combining "pre-" (meaning before) and "heals" (the verb form of "heal").  Therefore, a precise definition and usage examples require context.  It likely implies healing something before a problem fully manifests or worsens. | 例句：This preventative medicine aims to preheal potential issues before they become major problems.  (这种预防性药物旨在在问题成为重大问题之前就进行预先治疗。)  |近义词: prevent, preempt, treat proactively | 反义词: worsen, exacerbate, neglect | 词性: verb
