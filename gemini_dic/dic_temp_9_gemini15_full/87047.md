The word "hepper" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  Perhaps a misspelling of "helper," "hopper," or another word entirely?  Providing context (where you encountered this word) would be helpful.

2. **It's a slang term or dialect word:** It might be a very informal word used in a specific region or community.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **It's a newly coined word:**  New words are created all the time, but without more information, it's impossible to define this one.

4. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or place name.


Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical explanations as requested, because the word "hepper" lacks a recognized definition in standard English.  Please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
