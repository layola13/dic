The word "fullmart" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a newly coined word, a misspelling, or a brand name.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested are impossible.  To provide a response similar to your example, I need a valid English word.  If you can provide a different word or clarify the intended meaning of "fullmart," I can provide the requested analysis.
