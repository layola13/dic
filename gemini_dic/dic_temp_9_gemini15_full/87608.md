heterozygote:/ˌhetərəˈzaɪɡoʊt/| n. |杂合子|An individual having two different alleles of a particular gene or genes, one inherited from each parent.  A heterozygote is a diploid organism that carries two different alleles of a gene, resulting in a heterozygous genotype.  For example, if a gene has alleles A and a, a heterozygote would have the genotype Aa.  Unlike homozygotes, heterozygotes express different phenotypes depending on the nature of the alleles (dominant or recessive).|The plant is a heterozygote for flower color, carrying both the red and white alleles.|homozygote, hybrid|homozygote|


例句：

The pea plant is a heterozygote for flower color, exhibiting purple flowers due to the dominance of the purple allele. = 豌豆植株是花色杂合子，由于紫色等位基因的显性而表现出紫色花朵。

She is a heterozygote for the cystic fibrosis gene, meaning she carries one normal allele and one mutated allele. = 她患囊性纤维化基因杂合，这意味着她携带一个正常等位基因和一个突变等位基因。
