词源:
The word "overdignified" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the adjective "dignified" (meaning "having or showing dignity").  "Dignified" itself originates from the Old French word "dignifie," derived from the Latin "dignificare," meaning "to make worthy."
