The word "minini" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a word from a specific dialect or jargon, a proper noun, or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  To provide the requested information, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (e.g., a book, a conversation, a website)
* **What was the context?**  This will help determine the meaning and potential origin.


Without this information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  Please provide more details.
