词源：
The word "invitement" is derived from the verb "invite," ultimately from the Old French "inviter," meaning "to call in, invite."  The suffix "-ment" is a noun-forming suffix common in French-derived words, indicating a result or action.  Therefore, "invitement" literally means "the act of inviting" or "the thing that invites."  While less common than "invitation," "invitement" retains its etymological roots and shares a similar meaning.
