词源:
The word "neotropical" is a modern scientific term. It combines "neo-" (meaning "new" in Greek, often used in biogeography to indicate a relatively recent evolutionary origin or distinct faunal region) and "tropical" (referring to the tropical regions of the world).  The term was coined to specifically refer to the distinct biological region of Central and South America, distinguishing it from other tropical regions of the world like the Afrotropical region or the Indomalayan region.
