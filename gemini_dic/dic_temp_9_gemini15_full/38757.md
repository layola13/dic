词源:
Condone comes from the Old French word "condoner," meaning "to forgive."  This in turn derives from the Latin "condonare," which is a combination of "con-" (together, completely) and "donare" (to give).  The original sense implied giving something up or forgoing something—in this case, a punishment or grievance.
