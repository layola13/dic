词源:

* **give:**  Old English *gifan*, meaning "to give".  This has a long and consistent history in the Germanic languages.

* **free:** Old English *frēo*, meaning "free, exempt".  Related to Old High German *frio*, and ultimately Proto-Germanic *frijaz*.  This root also gives us words like "friend" and "freedom".

* **rein:** Old French *reine*, from Latin *regina*, meaning "bridle rein".  This refers to the straps used to control a horse. The metaphorical extension to "control" is significant here.

* **to:** This is a preposition indicating direction or purpose.


用法说明：

"Give free rein to" is an idiomatic expression.  It emphasizes the complete absence of restriction or control. The subject of the sentence "gives" the freedom, and the object of the preposition "to" receives that freedom.  It's usually used to describe the release of something that was previously constrained: emotions, creativity, ideas, actions, etc.
