nostoc:/ˈnɒstɒk/| n. |念珠藻属；发菜|Nostoc is a genus of cyanobacteria, often forming colonies that resemble small, gelatinous balls or filaments. These colonies are commonly found in various aquatic and terrestrial environments. They are known for their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, making them important contributors to soil fertility.  |Example:  The researchers studied the nitrogen-fixing capabilities of Nostoc colonies in rice paddies.  研究人员研究了水稻田中念珠藻菌落的固氮能力。|近义词：cyanobacteria (更广义的术语)|反义词：无|名词
