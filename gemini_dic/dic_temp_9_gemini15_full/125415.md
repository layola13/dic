multipath:/ˈmʌltipæθ/| n.|多路径；多路径传输|The term "multipath" refers to the propagation of radio waves along multiple paths between a transmitter and a receiver.  This phenomenon is common in wireless communication environments where signals can reflect off of buildings, hills, or other objects before reaching the receiver.  The multiple signals arrive at the receiver with varying delays and amplitudes, which can lead to signal degradation and interference.|Example: Multipath propagation is a significant challenge in designing reliable wireless communication systems. 多路径传播是设计可靠无线通信系统的一大挑战。|近义词：multipath propagation, multiple path|反义词：single path
