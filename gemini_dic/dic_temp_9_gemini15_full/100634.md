词源:

* **in-**:  prefix indicating negation or reversal. (否定或反转的前缀)
* **toler-**: from Latin *tolerare* meaning "to endure, bear, tolerate". (源于拉丁语 *tolerare*，意思是“忍受，承受，容忍”)
* **-able**: suffix making adjectives meaning "capable of" or "worthy of". (形容词后缀，表示“能够……”或“值得……”)
* **-ity**: suffix forming nouns from adjectives, indicating "state, condition, or quality". (名词后缀，由形容词构成，表示“状态，情况或性质”)


Therefore, "intolerability" literally means "the state of not being able to tolerate." (因此，“intolerability”字面意思是“无法容忍的状态”。)
