词源：

* **pseudo-**:  From Greek *pseudēs*, meaning "false," "lying," or "sham."

* **poetic**: From "poetry," ultimately derived from Greek *poiein*, meaning "to make" or "to create."  Thus, "poetic" relates to the art of creating poetry.


The word "pseudopoetic" combines the prefix "pseudo-" indicating falseness or imitation with the adjective "poetic," resulting in a description of something that attempts to mimic poetry but lacks its genuine qualities.
