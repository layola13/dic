词源：

* **quasi-**:  from Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "almost," or "similar to."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation to something but not a complete identity.

* **unconsciously**: from "unconscious" (adjective), formed with the prefix "un-" (negation) and "conscious" (adjective), ultimately deriving from Latin *conscius* ("knowing together," "aware").


用法说明：

`quasi-unconsciously` is an adverb that modifies verbs, describing the manner in which an action is performed. It suggests that the action was not entirely deliberate or intentional, but rather driven by subconscious impulses or habits.  The prefix "quasi-" softens the meaning of "unconsciously," indicating a degree of awareness, though minimal.  It's used to describe actions performed in a state between full consciousness and complete unconsciousness.  The actor might have some vague awareness of the action, but it isn't a primary focus of their attention.
