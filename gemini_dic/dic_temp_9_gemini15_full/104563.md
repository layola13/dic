注意事项：

The word "kanaka" has a deeply problematic history and should be avoided unless used within a specific historical context with clear explanation of its sensitive nature and problematic past.  Always prioritize respectful and accurate terminology when discussing Indigenous peoples.  Consider using terms like "Native Hawaiian," "Polynesian," or other specific ethnic group names instead.
