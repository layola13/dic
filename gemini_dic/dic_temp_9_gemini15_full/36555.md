collapsabilities:/ˌkəlæpsəˈbɪlətiz/| n. |可崩溃性；可坍塌性；易倒塌性 |The study of collapsabilities focuses on the likelihood and characteristics of a system's failure to maintain its structural integrity.  This includes understanding the factors contributing to collapse, such as material properties, external forces, and design flaws.|例句：The bridge's collapsabilities were underestimated due to flawed engineering calculations. 这座桥的可坍塌性由于工程计算错误而被低估了。The building's collapsabilities under seismic stress were a major concern for the engineers. 建筑物在地震压力下的可坍塌性是工程师们主要关心的问题。|近义词：instabilities, vulnerabilities, fragilities|反义词：stabilities, resiliencies, robustnesses|名词
