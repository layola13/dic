The word "scern" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following your requested format.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* It's a very rare or obsolete word.
* It's a word from a specific dialect or jargon.
* It's a newly coined word.


If you can provide more context or clarify the spelling, I can attempt to help.
