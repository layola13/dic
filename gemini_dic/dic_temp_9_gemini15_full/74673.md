词源:

The word "freebooter" comes from the Dutch word "vrijbuiter," a compound of "vrij" (free) and "buiter" (booter, plunderer).  It originally referred to Dutch privateers operating without official sanction. The term later spread to English and came to encompass any unauthorized sea raider or robber.
