词源:

The word "quotablenesses" is derived from "quotable," which in turn comes from the verb "quote."  "Quote" originates from the Latin word "quotāre," meaning "to quote, mention." The suffix "-ness" is added to form the noun "quotableness," indicating a state or quality.  Adding the plural "-es" creates "quotablenesses," referring to multiple instances or aspects of quotability.
