simulations:/ˌsɪmjuˈleɪʃənz/ | n. | 模拟，仿真 | The act of simulating something; a representation of a process or system using a model.  Simulations are used in many fields to predict outcomes, test hypotheses, or train individuals. | 例句：The engineers ran simulations to test the bridge's stability under various conditions. 工程师们进行了模拟实验以测试桥梁在各种条件下的稳定性。

例句：The flight simulator provided realistic simulations of various flight scenarios. 飞行模拟器提供了各种飞行场景的逼真模拟。


近义词：models, imitations, representations, reconstructions | 反义词：reality, actuality
