saturnicentric:/ˌsætərˈnɪsɛntrɪk/| adj.|以土星为中心的；以土星为中心点的| Relating to or centered on the planet Saturn.  This term is primarily used in astronomy and related fields to describe a perspective or model that places Saturn at the center.  For example, a "saturnicentric coordinate system" would use Saturn as the origin point for measurements.  The term is less common than "heliocentric" (sun-centered) or "geocentric" (Earth-centered).|The astronomer proposed a new model of the solar system, using a saturnicentric coordinate system to map the orbits of its moons.|近义词:Saturn-centered|反义词:heliocentric, geocentric


USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective and doesn't have verb conjugations or other grammatical forms like "hello".  It describes a perspective or system, not an action.  Therefore, standard tense conjugations are not applicable.  We can, however, demonstrate its use in different sentence structures.
