词源:
The word "chokidar" is derived from Hindi चौकीदार (cāukīdār), where चौकी (cāukī) means "guardhouse" or "watchtower," and दार (dār) is a suffix indicating "keeper" or "holder."  Thus, the word literally means "guardhouse keeper" or "watchtower keeper."  Its usage has spread to other South Asian languages and into English, particularly in contexts related to South Asian culture and history.
