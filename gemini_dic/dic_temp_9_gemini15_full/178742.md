rectinerved: /ˌrektɪˈnɜːvd/ | adj. | 直脉的 | Having straight, parallel veins, especially in leaves.  This term is primarily used in botany to describe the venation pattern of a leaf where the veins run parallel to each other and along the midrib. | Example: The leaves of this plant exhibit a rectinerved venation pattern.  这种植物的叶子呈现直脉纹理。 | 近义词: parallel-veined | 反义词: reticulated (网状脉的), pinnate (羽状脉的)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The leaves are rectinerved. = 叶子是直脉的。
This plant exhibits rectinerved venation. = 这种植物展现直脉叶脉。


一般过去时:
The leaves were rectinerved. = 叶子是直脉的。（过去）
The botanist observed rectinerved venation in the specimen. = 植物学家在标本中观察到直脉叶脉。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified many plants with rectinerved leaves. = 科学家们已经鉴定了许多具有直脉叶子的植物。
We have studied the rectinerved venation in detail. = 我们已经详细研究了直脉叶脉。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, we had suspected the leaves were rectinerved. = 在分析之前，我们怀疑叶子是直脉的。
They had already documented similar rectinerved patterns in other species. = 他们已经记录了其他物种中类似的直脉纹理。


将来时:
We will examine the leaves to determine if they are rectinerved. = 我们将检查叶子以确定它们是否是直脉的。
The research will show that the venation is rectinerved. = 研究将表明叶脉是直脉的。


虚拟语气:
If the leaves were rectinerved, it would support our hypothesis. = 如果叶子是直脉的，那将支持我们的假设。
I wish we had more examples of rectinerved leaves for comparison. = 我希望我们有更多直脉叶子的例子来进行比较。


被动语态:
The venation pattern was determined to be rectinerved. = 叶脉模式被确定为直脉的。
Rectinerved leaves are often found in monocots. = 直脉叶子经常在单子叶植物中发现。


疑问句:
Are the leaves rectinerved? = 叶子是直脉的吗？
Is this type of venation rectinerved or pinnate? = 这种叶脉是直脉的还是羽状的？


否定句:
The leaves are not rectinerved; they are reticulated. = 叶子不是直脉的；它们是网状的。
The venation pattern was not found to be rectinerved. = 叶脉模式未被发现是直脉的。


PHRASE->
rectinerved leaf = 直脉叶
rectinerved venation = 直脉叶脉
parallel-veined leaf (近义词组) = 平行脉叶
straight-veined leaf (近义词组) = 直脉叶
leaf venation pattern = 叶脉模式
