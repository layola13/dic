词源:
The word "panhandle" comes from the combination of "pan" (referring to a cooking pan) and "handle," originally referring to the handle of a pan.  The extended use to describe a long, thin strip of land attached to a larger area (like a geographical panhandle) followed later. The verb sense of begging, developed from the image of someone extending a hand like a panhandle, requesting alms.
