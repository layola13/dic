词源:
The word "signifieds" is the plural form of "signified,"  which derives from the French word "signifié," a term coined by Ferdinand de Saussure in his structuralist theory of linguistics.  Saussure distinguished between the "signifier" (the word or image) and the "signified" (the concept or meaning it represents).
