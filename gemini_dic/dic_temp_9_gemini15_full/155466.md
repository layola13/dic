词源:
From Greek *phainómenon, neuter of *phainómenos "appearing, visible," present participle of *phainein "to show, appear, shine," related to *phaos "light."  The word entered English in the late 17th century, initially referring to any observable phenomenon.  Its current sense of "extraordinary" developed later.
