词源:
The word "camouflagers" is derived from the French word "camoufler," meaning "to disguise" or "to mask."  This in turn has origins in the earlier French term "camouflet,"  originally referring to a type of firework or a small explosion used for masking sounds or movements. The word's use expanded to include the broader meaning of disguise, especially in military contexts, during World War I. The suffix "-ers" transforms the verb "camouflage" into a noun indicating the people or things that perform the action of camouflaging.
