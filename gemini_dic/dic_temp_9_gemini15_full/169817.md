词源:

From Latin *proscribere, from pro- ("before," "forth," "forward") + scribere ("to write").  Originally meaning "to write before" (as in to publish a list of outlaws), it evolved to mean "to outlaw" or "to forbid." The medical sense derives from the idea of writing down (prescribing) a treatment.
