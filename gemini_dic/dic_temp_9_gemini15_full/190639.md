词源:

The word "satyrlike" is derived from "satyr" + "-like".  "Satyr" comes from the Greek word "satyros" (σατυρος), referring to a mythological creature, often depicted as a hairy, man-like being with the legs and ears of a goat.  The "-like" suffix indicates resemblance or similarity.  The association of satyrs with unrestrained sexuality and wild behavior has contributed to the current meaning of "satyrlike".
