词源：

The word "hypersubtle" is a modern coinage, combining the prefix "hyper-" from Greek ὑπέρ (hupér, "over, above, beyond") and the adjective "subtle," which comes from the Latin "subtilis," meaning "thin, fine, delicate."  The combination creates a word emphasizing an extreme degree of subtlety.
