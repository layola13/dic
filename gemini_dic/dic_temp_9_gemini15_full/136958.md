词源:

The word "nonspecious" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "specious," which derives from the Latin word "speciosus," meaning "showy," "attractive," or "plausible."  Originally, "specious" referred to something that appeared attractive but was deceptive.  Therefore, "nonspecious" denotes the opposite: something that is not deceptive or misleading.


用法说明:

"Nonspecious" is primarily used to describe arguments, reasoning, or claims. It emphasizes the genuineness and lack of deception in the presented information.  It's a relatively formal word and is less common in everyday conversation than its antonym, "specious."
