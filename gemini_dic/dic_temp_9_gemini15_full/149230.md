The word "oxyphony" is a relatively rare word formed from Greek roots:

* **oxys (ὀξύς):** meaning "sharp," "acid," or "pointed."
* **phōnē (φωνή):** meaning "sound" or "voice."


Therefore, "oxyphony" literally means "sharp sound" or "pointed sound," reflecting its meaning of a harsh, unpleasant sound.
