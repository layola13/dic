词源:

The word "embezzler" comes from the verb "embezzle," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "embeseler," meaning "to put in a bag, to pocket."  This further developed from the Old French "beseler," meaning "to seduce, entice," which eventually relates to the Latin word "baculum," meaning "staff, stick."  The evolution reflects the secretive and often manipulative nature of the crime. The "-er" suffix is a common agent noun suffix in English, denoting the person who performs the action.
