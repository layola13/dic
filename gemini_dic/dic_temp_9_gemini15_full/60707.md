electro-analysis:/ɪˌlɛktrəʊəˈnælɪsɪs/| n. |电解分析|The analysis of a substance using electrochemical methods.  Electroanalysis is a branch of analytical chemistry that uses electrochemical techniques to identify and quantify chemical substances.  It relies on the relationship between the electrical properties of a solution and the concentration of the analytes within it.|Example: Electroanalysis was used to determine the concentration of lead in the water sample. 电解分析法被用来测定水样中铅的浓度。|近义词：electrochemical analysis, voltammetry|反义词：None specifically, but could be contrasted with methods like spectroscopy or chromatography.|
