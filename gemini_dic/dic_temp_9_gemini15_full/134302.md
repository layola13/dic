noninoculative: /ˌnɒnɪˈnɒkjʊlətɪv/ | adj. | 非接种的；非传染性的 | Not capable of being transmitted by inoculation; not infectious.  This term typically refers to a disease or condition that cannot be spread through direct contact or inoculation.


英文解析:The word "noninoculative" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "inoculative," which relates to inoculation—the introduction of a vaccine or other substance into the body to produce immunity to a disease. Therefore, "noninoculative" describes something that cannot be spread through such methods.


例句:

The researchers found that the disease was noninoculative, ruling out direct transmission as a primary mode of spread. = 研究人员发现该疾病是非接种性传播的，排除了直接传播作为主要传播方式。
