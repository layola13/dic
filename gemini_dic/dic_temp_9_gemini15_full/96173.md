The word "indepth" is a relatively modern compound word.  "In" is a preposition indicating position or inclusion. "Depth" refers to the extent or intensity of something. The combination suggests a thoroughness that reaches a significant level of detail.  There's no specific historical etymology beyond this straightforward compounding.
