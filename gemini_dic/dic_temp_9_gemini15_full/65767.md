The word "everych" does not exist in standard English.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information according to the requested format.  A possible explanation is that it's a misspelling, a newly coined word, or a word from a very specialized dialect or jargon.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more informed response.
