词源:The word "cack-handed" itself is of uncertain origin.  The "cack" element is likely a variant of "caked," meaning "twisted" or "crooked," possibly related to Old English words for crooked or twisted. "Handed" refers to the use of hands. Thus, "cack-handed" describes someone whose hands are clumsy or awkward in their movements.
