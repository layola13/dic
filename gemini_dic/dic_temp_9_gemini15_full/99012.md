词源:
The word "interactivity" is derived from the combining form "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and the noun "activity."  The suffix "-ity" forms nouns of quality or state.  Therefore, "interactivity" literally means "the quality of being interactive," or the state of reciprocal action between entities.
