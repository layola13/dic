词源:
The word "husband" in this context comes from the Old English word "husbonda," which literally meant "master of the house." Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the management of resources, especially in agriculture.  The "-er" suffix transforms the noun "husband" into the noun "husbander," signifying a person who performs the action of husbanding.
