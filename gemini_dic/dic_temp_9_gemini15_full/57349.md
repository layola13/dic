The word "dows" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling: Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a proper noun:  Is it a place name, a person's name, or a brand name?
* It's a technical term:  Is it specific to a particular field or area of study?
* It's a neologism or slang: Is it a newly coined word or a word used informally within a specific group?

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you can.  With more information, I can help you understand the word.
