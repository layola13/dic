词源:

Derived from the adjective "dated," meaning "out of date" or "old-fashioned."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun signifying the state or quality of being dated.  The root ultimately connects to the concept of a "date," referring to a specific point in time, implying that something is associated with a past time and therefore no longer contemporary.
