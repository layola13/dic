词源:

The word "polysyllabical" is derived from the following elements:

* **poly-**:  A prefix meaning "many" or "much."  It comes from the Greek word πολύς (polús).

* **syllab-**:  A combining form referring to a syllable. This comes from the Greek word συλλαβή (syllabē), meaning "syllable."

* **-ical**: A suffix forming adjectives, meaning "relating to" or "of the nature of." This comes from the Greek suffix -ικός (-ikos).


Therefore, "polysyllabical" literally means "relating to or having many syllables."
