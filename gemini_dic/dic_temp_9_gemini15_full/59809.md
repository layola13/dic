词源:

The word "ecstatic" comes from the Greek word "ekstasis" (ἔκστασις), which means "a state of being outside oneself," or "displacement."  Initially, this referred to a religious or mystical experience, a state of being transported beyond the ordinary.  Over time, the meaning shifted to describe an overwhelming feeling of joy and excitement.  The word entered English through Latin ("ecstasis").
