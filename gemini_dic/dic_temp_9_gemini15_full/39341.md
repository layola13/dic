conjoiners:/kənˈdʒɔɪnərz/ | n. |连接词，连接器 | Words or phrases that connect clauses or sentences. Conjoiners can be coordinating conjunctions (e.g., and, but, or) or subordinating conjunctions (e.g., because, although, if). They show the relationship between the connected parts of the sentence. |Example:  The sun was shining, and the birds were singing. (and is a coordinating conjoiner)  He went home because he was tired. (because is a subordinating conjoiner) |近义词：connectors, linkers, joining words |反义词：separators, disjunctives |名词


Etymology:  The word "conjoiner" is derived from the verb "conjoin," which combines the prefix "con-" (meaning "together") and the verb "join."  Therefore, a conjoiner is something that joins things together.
