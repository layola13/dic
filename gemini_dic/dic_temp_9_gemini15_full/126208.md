The word "mway" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  Perhaps you could provide more context where you encountered this word.
* **A slang term or regional dialect word:**  Its meaning would depend entirely on the specific community or region where it's used.
* **A neologism or newly coined word:**  If it's a newly invented word, there's no established meaning or usage.
* **An abbreviation or acronym:**  Without further information, it's impossible to decipher.


Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format, because the word "mway" lacks a standard definition in English.  Please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
