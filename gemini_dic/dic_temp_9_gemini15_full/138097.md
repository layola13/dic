normativism:/ˈnɔːrmətɪvɪzəm/| n. |规范主义；规范论|The philosophical approach that emphasizes norms, rules, and standards as fundamental to understanding and evaluating social phenomena.  It focuses on what *ought* to be, rather than simply what *is*.  It's often contrasted with positivism, which emphasizes empirical observation. |Example:  Normativism in legal theory suggests that law should reflect moral principles and ideals, not just positive enactments.  规范主义在法理学中表明法律应该反映道德原则和理想，而不仅仅是积极的制定。

Example: Some argue that the normativism of international relations theory has limited explanatory power when confronted with the realities of power politics.  一些人认为，当面对权力政治的现实时，国际关系理论的规范主义具有有限的解释力。
