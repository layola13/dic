词源:

The word "hassler" is derived from the verb "to hassle," which itself originates from the earlier slang term "hassle," meaning "to bother" or "to annoy."  The exact etymology of "hassle" is uncertain, but it likely emerged in the mid-20th century American English slang.  The suffix "-er" is added to create the noun "hassler," indicating a person who performs the action of hassling.
