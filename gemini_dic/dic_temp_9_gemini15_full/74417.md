词源:
The word "franchisee" is derived from the word "franchise," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "franchise," meaning "freedom," "liberty," or "privilege."  The suffix "-ee" indicates the recipient of an action.  Therefore, a "franchisee" is the recipient of a franchise, holding the privilege to operate under a specific brand.
