词源：
The word "corf" likely originates from the Old English word "corf," meaning a basket or container. Its application to ships probably arose from the resemblance of a wrecked and broken ship to a large, overturned basket.  The specific evolution requires further etymological investigation as it's not a widely documented word's journey.
