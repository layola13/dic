PHRASE->
Due to the rarity of the word, there are no common phrases using "nonvenomousnesses".  One might construct phrases like: "the established nonvenomousnesses," "the proven nonvenomousnesses," or "the surprising nonvenomousnesses," but these are not common expressions.

词源:
The word is formed from:
* non- (prefix): not
* venomous (adjective): poisonous
* -ness (suffix): state or quality
* -es (plural suffix):  indicates plurality of the state or quality.

Therefore, "nonvenomousnesses" literally means "the states or qualities of being not poisonous,"  a highly redundant and uncommon word.
