cotransports:/ˈkoʊˌtrænspɔːrts/ | n. |协同运输，共价运输 |The process by which two or more substances are simultaneously transported across a biological membrane, often using a single transporter protein.  This process frequently couples the movement of one substance down its concentration gradient (passive transport) to drive the movement of another substance against its concentration gradient (active transport).| Example: Sodium-glucose cotransport in the intestines is a crucial mechanism for absorbing glucose. 肠道中的钠-葡萄糖协同转运是吸收葡萄糖的关键机制。  The cells use the energy from the sodium gradient to move glucose against its concentration gradient. 细胞利用钠离子梯度的能量来逆浓度梯度移动葡萄糖。|近义词：coupled transport, symport |反义词：antiport (countertransport) |名词
