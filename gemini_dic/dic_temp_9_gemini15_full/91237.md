hydrochlorofluorocarbons:/ˌhaɪdroʊˌklɔːroʊˌfluːroʊˈkɑːrbənz/| n. |氢氯氟烃|Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are a class of chemical compounds containing hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine, and carbon.  They were developed as transitional substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) because they deplete the ozone layer less severely. However, they still contribute to global warming. |HCFCs are being phased out under the Montreal Protocol due to their ozone-depleting potential.  The use of HCFCs is strictly regulated in many countries. |近义词: CFC substitutes, ozone-depleting substances |反义词: ozone-friendly substances
