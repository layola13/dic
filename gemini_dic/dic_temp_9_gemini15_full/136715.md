词源:

The word "nonsensational" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "sensational."  "Sensational" ultimately derives from the Latin word "sensus," meaning "sense" or "feeling."  The suffix "-ational" creates an adjective from the noun "sensation."  Therefore, "nonsensational" literally means "not causing a strong feeling or sensation."
