词源:  The adverb "crabbedly" derives from the adjective "crabbed," which ultimately comes from the Old English word "crabba," meaning "crab."  The connection lies in the association of crabs with sideways movement and ill temper.  The adjective "crabbed" came to mean "difficult," "ill-tempered," and "peevish," and this meaning transferred to the adverbial form "crabbedly."
