pseudoracemate:/ˌsuːdəʊˈreɪsɪmeɪt/| n. |假外消旋体|A mixture of equal amounts of two enantiomers that appear to be a racemic mixture (a 1:1 mixture of enantiomers), but which is actually a different compound or a mixture of diastereomers.  It exhibits physical properties similar to those of a true racemate, but does not have the same chemical reactivity or crystalline structure.  The components can be separated more easily than in a true racemate. |Example:  The crystal structure analysis revealed that the seemingly racemic mixture was actually a pseudoracemate.  假外消旋体的晶体结构分析表明，这种看似外消旋的混合物实际上是假外消旋体。|近义词: diastereomeric mixture, conglomerate |反义词: racemate, enantiomer


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in chemistry and requires no grammatical conjugation like verbs or noun-verb agreement.  Instead, usage focuses on its application within the context of chemical descriptions and analysis.

Example 1: The researchers determined the compound was a pseudoracemate through X-ray crystallography. 研究人员通过X射线晶体学确定该化合物为假外消旋体。

Example 2:  Formation of a pseudoracemate can be influenced by solvent effects and crystallization conditions. 假外消旋体的形成会受到溶剂效应和结晶条件的影响。


PHRASE->

There are no common phrases directly related to "pseudoracemate" as it's a highly specialized scientific term.  Phrases involving related concepts such as "racemic mixture," "enantiomer," or "diastereomer" might be used in conjunction.

Example 1:  "Analysis of the racemic mixture revealed a pseudoracemate."  对消旋混合物的分析揭示了一个假外消旋体。

Example 2: "The separation of enantiomers within a pseudoracemate is easier."  假外消旋体中对映异构体的分离更容易。
