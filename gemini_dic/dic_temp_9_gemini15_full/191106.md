词源：

The word "scapegallows" combines "scape" (from "escape") and "gallows" (the structure used for hanging).  Originally, a "scapegallows" was someone who narrowly escaped hanging, hence implying someone lucky to have avoided punishment.  Over time, the meaning shifted to someone who is punished in place of someone else, thus becoming the "scapegoat."
