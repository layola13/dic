isobares:/ˈaɪsoʊbɑːrz/| n. |等压线|Lines on a map connecting points of equal atmospheric pressure. Isobars are used in weather maps to show the distribution of pressure and to help predict weather patterns.  They are typically drawn for every 4 millibars of pressure difference.|Example: The isobars on the weather map indicated a low-pressure system approaching.|近义词：isopleth (more general term for lines of equal value)|反义词：None specifically, but lines showing different values (e.g., isotherms for temperature) are contrasting.
