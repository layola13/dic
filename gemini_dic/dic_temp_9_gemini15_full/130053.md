non-photosynthetic: /ˌnɒnˌfoʊtoʊsɪnˈθɛtɪk/ | adj. | 非光合作用的 | Not capable of performing photosynthesis.  Organisms that are non-photosynthetic cannot produce their own food using sunlight.  | 例句：Fungi are non-photosynthetic organisms, relying on other sources for nutrition.  真菌是非光合作用的生物，依靠其他来源获取营养。

Many heterotrophic organisms are non-photosynthetic. 许多异养生物是非光合作用的。

近义词：heterotrophic (in the context of nutrition)  | 反义词：photosynthetic


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Non-photosynthetic organisms obtain energy from other sources. = 非光合作用的生物从其他来源获取能量。
This plant is non-photosynthetic and relies on parasitism. = 这种植物是非光合作用的，依靠寄生生存。


一般过去时:
Scientists discovered that the bacteria was non-photosynthetic. = 科学家发现这种细菌是非光合作用的。
The researchers confirmed the organism was non-photosynthetic. = 研究人员证实该生物是非光合作用的。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified many non-photosynthetic species. = 研究人员已经鉴定了许多非光合作用的物种。
We have learned that some fungi are non-photosynthetic. = 我们已经了解到一些真菌是非光合作用的。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, it was believed the species was photosynthetic, but it had been revealed to be non-photosynthetic. = 在发现之前，人们认为该物种是光合作用的，但后来被证明是非光合作用的。
Scientists had previously misidentified the organism as photosynthetic, but later tests showed it to be non-photosynthetic. = 科学家先前曾错误地将该生物识别为光合作用的，但后来的测试表明它是无光合作用的。


将来时:
Future research will focus on the evolution of non-photosynthetic organisms. = 未来的研究将集中在非光合作用生物的进化上。
We will further investigate the metabolic pathways of this non-photosynthetic bacteria. = 我们将进一步研究这种非光合作用细菌的代谢途径。


虚拟语气:
If the organism were non-photosynthetic, it would need alternative energy sources. = 如果该生物是非光合作用的，它将需要替代能源。
It would be surprising if this plant was found to be non-photosynthetic. = 如果发现这种植物是非光合作用的，那将令人惊讶。


被动语态:
Many non-photosynthetic organisms are studied by biologists. = 许多非光合作用的生物被生物学家研究。
The non-photosynthetic nature of the organism was confirmed by the experiment. = 该生物的非光合作用特性通过实验得到了证实。


疑问句:
Is this type of bacteria non-photosynthetic? = 这种细菌是非光合作用的吗？
Are all fungi non-photosynthetic? = 所有真菌都是非光合作用的吗？


否定句:
This plant is not non-photosynthetic; it produces its own food. = 这种植物不是非光合作用的；它自己制造食物。
The organism is not necessarily non-photosynthetic; further investigation is required. = 该生物不一定是无光合作用的；需要进一步调查。


PHRASE->
Non-photosynthetic bacteria = 非光合细菌
Non-photosynthetic organisms = 非光合生物
Non-photosynthetic pathways = 非光合途径
Non-photosynthetic eukaryotes = 非光合真核生物
Non-photosynthetic life = 非光合生命
