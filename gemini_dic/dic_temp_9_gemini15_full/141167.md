The term describes structures or processes associated with this type of spore. | The ooesporic stage of the fungus is characterized by its resistance to harsh environmental conditions.  卵孢阶段的真菌以其耐受恶劣环境条件的能力为特征。|  近义词：oosporogenous (producing oospores) | 反义词： 无直接反义词，可考虑与无性繁殖相关的形容词，例如asexual, vegetative.


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in mycology (the study of fungi) and phycology (the study of algae), and less frequently in general usage.  Therefore, providing examples across all grammatical tenses is not practical or relevant.  Illustrative examples are limited to its typical context.

The ooesporic cysts are resistant to desiccation. = 卵孢囊对干燥具有抵抗力。
Ooesporic germination is triggered by specific environmental cues. = 卵孢的萌发是由特定的环境因素触发的。

ooesporic germination: 卵孢萌发
ooesporic development: 卵孢发育
ooesporic production: 卵孢产生
ooesporic wall: 卵孢壁
ooesporic resting stage: 卵孢休眠期
