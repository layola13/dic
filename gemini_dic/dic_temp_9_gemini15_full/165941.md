The word "preoverthrowing" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, formed by combining the prefix "pre-" with the verb "overthrowing."  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and standard grammatical usage descriptions are impossible.

However, we can analyze its potential meaning and construction:

/ˌpriːˈoʊvərθroʊɪŋ/ | adj. | 推翻前的；即将推翻的 |  Describes something that occurs before or is in the process of overthrowing something else.  It implies anticipation or preparation for an overthrow. |


英文解析: This word is not found in standard dictionaries. It's likely a newly created word combining "pre-" (meaning before or in preparation for) and "overthrowing" (the act of violently removing someone from power).  It suggests the actions, events, or conditions leading up to an overthrow.


例句:

The preoverthrowing period was marked by increasing unrest and political instability.  = 推翻前的时期以日益增长的不安和政治动荡为特征。


The preoverthrowing regime implemented harsh policies to maintain control. = 推翻前的政权实施严厉政策以维持控制。


近义词:  There isn't a direct single-word synonym.  Phrases like "prior to the overthrow," "in the lead-up to the revolution," or "before the coup" could be used instead.


反义词: post-overthrow, after the revolution.


词性: Adjective (primarily)


USAGE->  Because "preoverthrowing" is not a standard word, standard grammatical tense conjugations are inapplicable.  Its usage would follow the rules of adjective usage within a sentence.  For example:

The preoverthrowing atmosphere was tense. (Simple Present)
The preoverthrowing conditions were unstable. (Simple Past)


PHRASE->

There are no established phrases using "preoverthrowing."  The word itself is a phrase-like construction.


**Important Note:**  The use of "preoverthrowing" should be approached cautiously in formal writing.  It's unlikely to be understood by a wide audience and might be considered awkward or unconventional.  It's best to use clearer, more established phrasing to convey the intended meaning.
