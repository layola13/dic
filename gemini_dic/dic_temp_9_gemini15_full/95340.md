词源:

The word "incense" comes from the Old French word "encens," which in turn derives from the Latin "incensum," the past participle of "incendere," meaning "to burn."  The meaning shifted over time from simply referring to the burning of something to the fragrant substance itself and eventually the act of angering someone.
