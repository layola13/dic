From Middle English *sepal, from Late Latin *sepale, from Latin *sepalum, a diminutive of Latin *sepa "a hedge, enclosure," from Proto-Italic *sepā, from Proto-Indo-European *(s)pe- "to cut, cleave, separate."  The word reflects the sepals' function of enclosing and protecting the developing flower bud.
