preconductors:/ˌpriːkənˈdʌktərz/| n. |预先导体；前导体 |A preconductor is a term used in some specialized fields, particularly in the context of superconducting materials and high-voltage power transmission, to refer to a component or material that acts as a precursor or initial conductor before a superconducting state is achieved or a full conducting system is established.  It might be a normal conductor that facilitates the initial current flow before a superconducting element becomes fully functional.  The exact meaning and application vary depending on the context.|例句：The research team studied the properties of different preconductors to optimize the transition to superconductivity.  研究团队研究了不同前导体的特性，以优化向超导性的转变。|近义词：precursor,  initial conductor |反义词：final conductor, superconductor (in the context of its fully functional state)
