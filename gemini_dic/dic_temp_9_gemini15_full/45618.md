词源:
The word "cursed" originates from the Old English word "cursian," meaning "to curse."  This, in turn, is related to the Proto-Germanic word "*kurson," and ultimately to the Proto-Indo-European root "*gʷer-, "* meaning "to call, cry out," suggesting an etymological connection to the act of invoking a curse through vocalization.
