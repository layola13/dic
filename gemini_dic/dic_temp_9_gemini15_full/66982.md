词源:

The word "expert" comes from the Old French word "expert," meaning "experienced," "skilled," or "tried."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "expertus," the past participle of "experiri," meaning "to try," "to test," or "to experience."  The evolution reflects the original meaning of someone who has gained knowledge and skill through extensive testing and experience.
