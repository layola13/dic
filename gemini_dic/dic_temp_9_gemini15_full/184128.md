词源:

The word "resistant" comes from the Old French word "resistante," the feminine form of "resistant," meaning "resisting".  The ultimate origin is the Latin verb "resistere," meaning "to stand against," "to oppose," or "to withstand."  The prefix "re-" means "back" or "again," and the root "-sistere"  is related to the Latin word "stare," meaning "to stand."
