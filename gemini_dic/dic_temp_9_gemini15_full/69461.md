The word "feine" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, detailed etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information according to your requested format.  To assist you, I need the correct spelling or the language of origin.
