词源:
The word "scalpel" comes from the Medieval Latin word "scalpellus," a diminutive of "scalpellum," meaning "small knife."  "Scalpellum" itself is derived from the Latin word "scalpere," meaning "to scrape" or "to carve."  Thus, the word's origin reflects the instrument's use for making small, precise cuts.
