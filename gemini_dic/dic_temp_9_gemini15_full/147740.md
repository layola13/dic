词源:
The word "overproduce" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "produce" (meaning "to create or manufacture").  Its origin traces back to the Old French "produire" (to bring forth, yield), ultimately from the Latin "producere" (to lead forth, bring forth).  The "over-" prefix is of Old English origin.
