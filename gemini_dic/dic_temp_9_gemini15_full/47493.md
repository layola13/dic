词源:
The word "deanship" is derived from "dean" + "-ship."  "Dean" originates from the Latin word "decānus," meaning "ten," originally referring to a church official overseeing a group of ten. Over time, the title evolved to refer to the head of a college or faculty.  "-ship" is a suffix denoting office, condition, or skill.
