envelopers:/ɪnˈvɛləpərz/| n. |信封(复数)；包裹者(复数)|The word "envelopers" is the plural form of "enveloper," which itself is less common than the verb "envelop."  It refers to either multiple envelopes (containers for letters or documents) or, less frequently, to people or things that envelop or enclose something.  |例句：The secretary gathered up the envelopers and placed them on the desk.  秘书收集好信封并把它们放在桌子上。


例句：The swirling fog envelopers the mountain peaks. (This usage is less common and refers to things doing the enveloping.)  旋涡状的雾气笼罩着山峰。(这种用法不太常见，指的是进行包裹的事物。)


近义词：containers (for the envelope meaning), wrappers, enclosers |反义词：None directly applicable.  The antonym would depend on the context.  For example, if referring to something opening instead of closing, then "openers" could be considered an antonym in a specific situation.
