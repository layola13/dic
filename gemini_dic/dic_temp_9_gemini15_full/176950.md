The word "reallegations" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  It seems to be an attempt to combine "re-" (meaning again) and "allegations" (statements claiming something is true without proof).


Therefore, a full analysis following your requested format is impossible.  However, we can analyze the components:


**re-**

/riː/ | prefix | 再，重新，重复 |  Indicates repetition or doing something again. |  He *re*read the letter. 他又读了一遍信。 |  近义词: again, anew | 反义词:  N/A (prefixes don't have direct antonyms)


**allegations**

/ˌælɪˈɡeɪʃənz/ | n. | 指控，说法，断言 | A statement claiming something is true without proof.  Allegations are often made in the context of accusations, especially in legal or investigative settings. |  The *allegations* of fraud were investigated by the police.  关于欺诈的指控正在接受警方的调查。| 近义词: accusations, claims, assertions | 反义词: proof, evidence


**Hypothetical Analysis of "reallegations" (if it were a word):**

Assuming "reallegations" were intended to mean "repeated allegations" or "new allegations related to previous ones," the analysis would be as follows (but remember, this is speculative):


/ˌriːælɪˈɡeɪʃənz/ | n. | 重复指控；与先前指控相关的新的指控 | Repeated allegations or new allegations related to previous ones.  This word would imply a continuation or expansion of previous accusations. | The *reallegations* against the CEO further damaged the company's reputation. 对首席执行官的再次指控进一步损害了公司的声誉。 | 近义词: repeated accusations, further allegations, renewed claims | 反义词:  refutation, denial, exoneration
