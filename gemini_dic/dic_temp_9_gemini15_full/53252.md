词源:
From Middle English *drefull, from Old English *drēorig "sad, mournful," from drūsian "to be sad, sorrowful."  The modern spelling evolved from the earlier forms.  The word originally carried a stronger sense of sadness and sorrow, gradually evolving to encompass the sense of dread and impending disaster we associate with it today.
