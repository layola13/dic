词源:

The word "hyperdelicacies" is a compound word.  "Hyper-" is a prefix meaning "excessive" or "beyond," derived from the Greek word "hyper" (ὑπέρ). "Delicacies" refers to fine foods, derived from the Old French "delicatesse," ultimately from the Latin "delicatus," meaning "delicate" or "pleasing to the taste."  Therefore, "hyperdelicacies" literally means "excessively delicate foods" or "foods that are beyond delicate."
