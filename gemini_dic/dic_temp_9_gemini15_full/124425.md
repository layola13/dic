词源:
The word "motorcycle" is a blend of "motor" and "bicycle".  "Motor" comes from the Latin "movere" (to move), reflecting the engine's function. "Bicycle" is a compound word from "bi-" (two) and "cycle" (wheel), reflecting its two-wheeled nature.  Therefore, "motorcycle" literally means a vehicle with a motor and two wheels.
