近义词：softest, pulpiest, sappiest, sloppiest, gooiest,  most sentimental


反义词：firmest, hardest, driest, least sentimental


词源:  Derived from "mush," which originally meant a type of food made from cornmeal, and later came to mean something soft and pulpy.  The "-iest" suffix is a superlative adjective ending, indicating the highest degree.  The sentimental usage developed later, associating the soft, formless quality of mush with a lack of firmness or strength in emotion, resulting in excessive sentimentality.
