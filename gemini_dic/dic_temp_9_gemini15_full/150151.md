词源:
The word "pan-fry" is a compound word.  "Pan" refers to the cooking vessel (frying pan), and "fry" means to cook in hot fat or oil.  Both elements have Germanic origins. "Pan" derives from Old French and ultimately from Latin, while "fry" comes from Old English.  The combination to describe this cooking method emerged relatively recently in the history of English.
