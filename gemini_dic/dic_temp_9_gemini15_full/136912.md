Why is the mixture remaining nonsolidified? = 为什么混合物仍然未固化？


否定句:
The mixture is not nonsolidified; it has hardened. = 混合物没有未固化；它已经硬化了。
The substance is no longer nonsolidified; it has solidified. = 该物质不再未固化；它已经凝固了。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "nonsolidified".  The word is primarily used in scientific and technical contexts.  Instead, consider phrases that describe the state of the material, such as:  "in a liquid state," "in a molten state," "unhardened,"  "in a fluid state," "yet to solidify".
