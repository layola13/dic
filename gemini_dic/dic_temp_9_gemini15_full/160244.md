词源:
The word "pontificating" comes from the Latin word "pontifex," meaning "bridge builder."  In ancient Rome, the Pontifex Maximus was the highest-ranking priest, and the word came to be associated with the pronouncements of religious authorities. Over time, it acquired its current meaning of speaking or writing in a pompous and dogmatic way.
