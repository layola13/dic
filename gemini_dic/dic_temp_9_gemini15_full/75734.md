fullerene:/ˈfʊləriːn/| n. |富勒烯|A fullerene is a molecule of carbon in the form of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, tube, or many other shapes.  Fullerenes are similar in structure to graphite, which is composed of sheets of linked hexagonal rings of carbon atoms; but fullerenes also contain pentagonal (and sometimes heptagonal) rings that cause the graphite sheet to curve into a sphere or other shape.  The most famous fullerene is Buckminsterfullerene (C60), also known as a buckyball. |例句：Scientists are exploring the potential applications of fullerenes in medicine and materials science. 科学家们正在探索富勒烯在医学和材料科学中的潜在应用。

The discovery of C60 revolutionized nanotechnology. C60的发现彻底改变了纳米技术。|近义词：buckyball (for C60), carbon allotrope |反义词：无

词源:
The name "fullerene" is derived from the architect Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic domes resemble the structure of C60.  The suffix "-ene" indicates the presence of carbon-carbon double bonds, although this is a simplification as fullerenes have a complex bonding structure.
