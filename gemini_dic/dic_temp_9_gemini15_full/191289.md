词源:
The word "scavenge" ultimately derives from the Old French word "escavager," meaning "to dig," which in turn may be related to a Germanic root.  The original sense related to digging for food or treasure.  Over time, the meaning shifted to the more modern sense of searching for and collecting discarded items.
