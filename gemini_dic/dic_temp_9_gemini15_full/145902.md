词源:

The word "overdiffuses" is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much") with the verb "diffuses," which comes from the Latin word "diffundere," meaning "to pour out in different directions,"  "to spread," or "to scatter."  Therefore, "overdiffuses" literally means "to spread excessively."
