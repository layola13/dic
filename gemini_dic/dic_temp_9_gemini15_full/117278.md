词源:  The word "mechanized" is derived from the noun "mechanism" (a system of parts working together in a machine), which itself comes from the Greek word "mēkhanē" (meaning "machine," "contrivance," or "engine").  The suffix "-ized" indicates the process of making something into a certain state.  Therefore, "mechanized" literally means "made into a machine-like state" or "made to operate using machines."
