词源:
The word "drummed" comes from the Old English word "drum", which ultimately derives from Proto-Germanic *drum-, meaning "drum" or "hollow vessel".  Its use as a verb meaning "to beat a drum" is a natural extension of the noun's meaning, and the figurative uses ("to repeat something persistently," "to force someone to do something") developed later.
