词源:
The word "eudemonistical" is derived from the Greek word "eudaimonia" (εὐδαιμονία), which translates to "flourishing" or "living well."  It's a combination of "eu" (good) and "daimon" (spirit, fortune).  The "-ical" suffix indicates an adjective form.  The concept of eudaimonia was central to the ethical philosophies of Aristotle and other ancient Greek thinkers.
