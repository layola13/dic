retrocausa: /ˌrɛtroʊˈkɔːzə/ | n. |逆因；反向因果关系 | A retrocausal effect is one where an effect precedes its cause in time.  This concept challenges the traditional understanding of causality, where cause always precedes effect.  It's a theoretical concept explored in philosophy and physics, particularly in relation to quantum mechanics and interpretations of time.  The existence of retrocausality is highly debated and there's no widely accepted scientific evidence to support it. | Example: Some interpretations of quantum mechanics suggest the possibility of retrocausal influences, where a future event might influence a past event.  | 近义词:backward causation, reverse causality | 反义词:causality, direct causation | 名词
