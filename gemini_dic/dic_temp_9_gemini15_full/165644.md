词源：
The word "premisrepresents" is formed from the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in front of"), the verb "misrepresent" (meaning to give a false or misleading account of something), and the present tense verb ending "-s" indicating a third person singular subject.  "Misrepresent" itself combines "mis-" (wrongly) and "represent" (to present).  The root of "represent" lies in the Latin "repraesentare," from "re-" (again) and "praesentare" (to present).  Therefore, the word's etymology reflects the act of presenting something incorrectly or falsely.
