词源:

The word "oenanthylous" is derived from the obsolete word "oenanthic," which itself originates from the Greek words οἶνος (oinos) meaning "wine" and ἄνθος (anthos) meaning "flower."  Early chemists associated the heptyl group with the aroma of wine, hence the name.  The "-ous" suffix indicates an adjective.


用法说明:

This word is highly specialized and primarily used within the context of chemistry and related scientific fields.  It is rarely encountered in everyday language.  The understanding of organic chemistry and the concept of alkyl groups is necessary to comprehend its meaning.
