nonagglutinative: /ˌnɒnəˈɡluːtɪnətɪv/ | adj. | 非黏着性的；不粘着的 |  Describes a language in which words are not formed by adding many prefixes or suffixes.  Such languages tend to have relatively simple word structures, with less morphological complexity than agglutinative or fusional languages.  The meaning of words is primarily conveyed through their independent forms, rather than through complex affixation. |

词源：

* **non-**:  prefix meaning "not"
* **agglutination**: from Latin *agglutinare* "to glue together," from *ad-* "to" + *glutinare* "to glue."  This refers to the grammatical process of combining morphemes (meaningful units) to create words.


USAGE->  (This word is primarily used as an adjective describing languages, not in a wide range of grammatical constructions like "what.")  Therefore, there are no typical usages across tenses, voices, etc., as requested in the example.  The adjective simply modifies a noun.  For example:


A nonagglutinative language: 一种非黏着性语言
A nonagglutinative structure:  一种非黏着性结构


PHRASE->  (Phrases using "nonagglutinative" are primarily found in linguistic contexts.)  There are few common idiomatic phrases.
