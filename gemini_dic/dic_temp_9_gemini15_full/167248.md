The word "preternaturalnesses" is derived from:

* **preternatural:**  This word is a combination of:
    * **pre-:**  A prefix meaning "before" or "beyond."
    * **ter-:**  A variant of "trans-," meaning "across" or "beyond."
    * **natural:**  Referring to the natural world or order.
    Thus, "preternatural" means "beyond what is natural" or "supernatural."

* **-ness:** A suffix forming abstract nouns, indicating a state, quality, or condition.
