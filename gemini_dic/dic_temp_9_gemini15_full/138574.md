nth-roots:/ˈɛnθ ruːts/ | n. | n次方根 | The nth root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself n times, equals the original number.  For example, the cube root (3rd root) of 8 is 2, because 2 x 2 x 2 = 8.  The concept extends to any positive integer n. | Example: Finding the square root (2nd root) of 25 is a simple example of finding an nth root. The square root of 25 is 5 because 5 * 5 =25.  Finding the fourth root of 16 involves finding a number that, when multiplied by itself four times, equals 16; this is 2 because 2*2*2*2=16. | 近义词:radical (in the context of roots)| 反义词:power (as in raising to a power) | n.
