词源:
The term is a blend of "half" and "arsed," with "arsed" being a vulgar shortening of "arse," meaning buttocks.  The implication is that the effort put into something is only half of what it should be, as if one is only using half their posterior (arse) to do the work.  The term's origins are British English.
