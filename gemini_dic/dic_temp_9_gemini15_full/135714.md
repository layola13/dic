USAGE->
This word is extremely rare and does not have common usage in standard English grammar contexts.  The grammatical structures (present tense, past tense, etc.) would apply as they do to any plural noun. However, due to the rarity of the word, providing examples for each tense would be artificial and unhelpful.  It's more appropriate to focus on contextual usage.

Example Sentences illustrating possible usage:

* **Simple Present:** The report details the nonpreventivenesses inherent in the system. 报告详细说明了系统中固有的不可预防性。
* **Simple Past:**  The researchers discovered several unforeseen nonpreventivenesses during the experiment. 研究人员在实验中发现了一些不可预见的不可能性。
* **Present Perfect:** We have identified numerous nonpreventivenesses that need to be addressed. 我们已经确定了许多需要解决的不可预防性问题。


PHRASE->
Because "nonpreventivenesses" is such a rare and unwieldy word,  it's unlikely to appear in common phrases.  Phrases would be built around the concept of prevention, rather than its negation.  For example:

* lack of preventability
* absence of preventative measures
* failure to prevent
* inability to prevent
* inherent non-preventability


Note:  The word "nonpreventivenesses" is a very unusual and cumbersome word.  It's far more common and natural to use alternative phrasing to express the concept of things that cannot be prevented.  For instance,  "unavoidable factors," "inevitable consequences," or "inherent risks" would be far more appropriate in most contexts.
