词源:

The phrase "go-to-it" is a colloquialism, meaning it's informal and commonly used in everyday speech.  Its origin is not precisely documented, but it's likely a combination of the verb "go" (meaning to proceed or act) and the pronoun "it" (referring to a task or challenge).  The implied meaning is "to proceed directly and energetically to the task at hand."  The use of "it" is somewhat vague, allowing the phrase to be applied to a wide range of situations.  Its usage reflects a direct and pragmatic approach to problem-solving or task completion.
