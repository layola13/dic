The word "Jehovic" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a variant of "Jehovah," a name for God in the Old Testament.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis as requested using the provided format.  If you intended to ask about "Jehovah," I can provide that information.
