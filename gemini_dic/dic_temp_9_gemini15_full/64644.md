erythrogranulose: /ˌɛrɪθroʊˈɡrænjʊloʊs/ | n. | 赤红颗粒物 |  A red granular substance, especially one found in certain tissues or cells.  This term is primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly in histology (the study of tissues) and pathology (the study of diseases).  It often refers to a specific type of granular deposit or inclusion within cells or tissues, characterized by its reddish color.  The exact composition and significance of erythrogranulose can vary depending on the context.  Further information about the specific tissue or cell type is needed for precise definition. |  例句：The microscopic analysis revealed the presence of erythrogranulose in the affected liver cells. 显微镜分析显示受损肝细胞中存在赤红颗粒物。


| 近义词:  red granules, reddish inclusion, granular deposit | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, as it describes a specific type of substance) | 词性:名词

词源:
The word "erythrogranulose" is a compound word derived from:

* **erythro-**:  From Greek "erythros," meaning "red."
* **granul-**: From Latin "granulum," meaning "small grain" or "granule."
* **-ose**: A suffix often used in chemistry to denote a type of substance (similar to suffixes like "-ite" or "-ide").

Therefore, the word literally means "red granular substance."
