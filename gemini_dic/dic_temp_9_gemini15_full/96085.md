词源:

The word "indefectibility" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), "defect" (meaning "a flaw or imperfection"), and the suffix "-ibility" (meaning "capable of").  Therefore, it literally means "not capable of having a defect."  The root "defect" traces back to Latin *dēfectus, the past participle of *dēficere, meaning "to fail" or "to be wanting."
