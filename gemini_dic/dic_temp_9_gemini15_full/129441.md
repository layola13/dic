词源：The word "non-absolute" is a compound word.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," derived from Latin "non," and "absolute" comes from the Latin "absolutus," meaning "released," "free from," or "perfect."  Therefore, "non-absolute" literally means "not absolute" or "not completely free from limitations."


用法说明：

"Non-absolute" is primarily used as an adjective to modify nouns, describing something that is not absolute or complete. It implies the existence of exceptions or limitations.  The context is crucial to understanding its specific meaning, as the degree of "non-absoluteness" can vary.  It often appears in discussions of ethics, morality, law, and scientific principles, where absolute statements are rarely applicable.
