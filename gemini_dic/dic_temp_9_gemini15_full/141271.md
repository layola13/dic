词源:

The word derives from the adjective "opaque," which comes from the Late Latin word "opācus," meaning "dark," "shaded," or "hidden."  This, in turn, traces back to the Proto-Indo-European root "*apk-", meaning "to cover" or "to hide."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating the state or quality of being opaque, and the plural "-es" denotes multiple instances.


用法说明:

"Opaquenesses" is primarily used in formal contexts, often in academic writing or discussions about complex systems or processes. It is less common in everyday conversation. It suggests a multiplicity of unclear or hidden aspects, rather than simply one instance of opacity.  The word emphasizes the difficulty in understanding due to the numerous layers of obscurity.
