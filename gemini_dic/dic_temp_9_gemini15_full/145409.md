词源：

The word is derived from the adjective "censorious," meaning "given to censoring or criticizing severely,"  itself coming from the verb "censor," ultimately from Latin "censor" (a Roman official with powers of oversight and punishment). The prefix "over-" signifies "excessively" or "too much." Therefore, "overcensoriousness" literally means "the state of being excessively critical."
