词源:
The word "entreaty" comes from the Old French word "entreté," which itself derives from the verb "entretenir," meaning "to hold," "to maintain," or "to entertain."  The sense shifted over time to imply a holding onto someone's attention or goodwill through pleading.  The "-y" suffix makes it a noun, signifying the act of entreating.
