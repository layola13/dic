semi-group:/ˈsɛmiɡruːp/| n. |半群|A semigroup is an algebraic structure consisting of a set together with an associative binary operation.  This means that the operation, often denoted by ·, satisfies the associative law: (a · b) · c = a · (b · c) for all elements a, b, and c in the set.  Unlike a group, a semigroup does not require the existence of an identity element or inverse elements. |Example: The set of positive integers under addition forms a semigroup because addition is associative.  (1 + 2) + 3 = 1 + (2 + 3) = 6. The set of all strings over an alphabet under concatenation is also a semigroup.|近义词：monoid (if it has an identity element)|反义词：group (if it requires inverses and identity)|无


USAGE->
This word is primarily used within the context of abstract algebra and related fields.  There are no common verb conjugations or tenses associated with "semigroup" as it functions as a noun.  The following examples illustrate its use in different sentences:


Example 1:
The set of all non-negative integers under addition forms a commutative semigroup. =  所有非负整数在加法运算下构成一个交换半群。


Example 2:
In this paper, we will study the properties of finite semigroups. = 在这篇论文中，我们将研究有限半群的性质。


Example 3 (Passive Voice):
The structure was identified as a specific type of semigroup. = 该结构被识别为一种特定类型的半群。


Example 4 (Question):
Is the given set a semigroup under this operation? = 在此运算下，给定的集合是一个半群吗？


Example 5 (Negative Sentence):
This system is not a semigroup because the operation is not associative. = 这个系统不是半群，因为该运算不满足结合律。


PHRASE->
