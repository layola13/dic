gemmification:/ˌdʒɛmɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/ | n. | 芽生，出芽；宝石化 | The process of producing buds or gems, especially in plants;  the formation of gem-like structures.  This term is primarily used in botany and geology, referring to the development of buds or the formation of crystalline structures resembling gems. | Example: The gemmification of the potato plant results in the formation of "eyes," which are actually buds.  马铃薯植物的芽生导致形成“芽眼”，实际上是芽。 |近义词：budding, gemmation | 反义词：No direct antonym exists, but terms implying lack of bud formation or crystallization could be considered opposites in context.
