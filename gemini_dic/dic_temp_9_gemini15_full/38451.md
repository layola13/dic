The word "concessionaire" comes from the French word "concession," meaning "grant,"  "granting," or "concession."  It is ultimately derived from the Latin word "concedere," which means "to yield," "to grant," or "to concede." The suffix "-aire" is a common French noun suffix forming agent nouns.  Therefore, a concessionaire is literally someone who is granted something.
