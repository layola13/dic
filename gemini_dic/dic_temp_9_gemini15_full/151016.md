词源:

The word "paranoid" originates from the Greek word "paranoia," meaning "madness beside oneself," or "mental derangement."  It entered English in the late 19th century, initially used in a clinical context to describe a specific type of mental illness characterized by delusions of persecution and grandeur.  Over time, its usage broadened to describe any excessive suspicion or distrust, even in non-clinical contexts.
