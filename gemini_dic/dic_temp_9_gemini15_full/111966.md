词源:
The name "Lombardy" derives from the Lombards, a Germanic people who migrated to Italy in the 6th century AD and established a kingdom in the region.  The name itself is ultimately of Germanic origin, possibly related to words meaning "longbeards" or referring to a specific tribal group.  Over time, the name evolved through various linguistic changes to become "Lombardy."
