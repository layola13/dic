词源:
The word "hyper-salinity" is a combination of two elements:

* **hyper-**:  A prefix of Greek origin meaning "over," "above," "beyond," or "excessive."
* **salinity**: From Latin "salinitas," meaning "saltiness."  This is related to the Latin word "sal," meaning "salt."

Therefore, hyper-salinity literally means "excessive saltiness."
