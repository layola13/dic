词源:
The phrase originates from horse racing.  "Wire" refers to the finish line wire.  A race that is "down to the wire" is one that is decided at the very end, as the horses are nearing the finish line.  The phrase has since extended its use beyond horse racing to describe any situation decided at the last minute.
