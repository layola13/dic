/hɑːf ˈraɪzɪz/| n.| 半升；半起 | A half-rise refers to a partial elevation or increase, often in a gradual or incremental way.  It is not a standard dictionary word, but rather a compound term formed from "half" and "rises".  The meaning is context-dependent, and needs more context to be fully understood.  For example, it could refer to a partial rise in temperature, a partial rise in bread dough,  or a partial increase in stock prices.  | The bread dough experienced a half-rise before the second proofing.  = 面包面团在第二次醒发前经历了半发酵。 The temperature showed a half-rise in the afternoon. = 下午气温略有上升。 |  partial increase, slight rise, incremental elevation|  complete fall,  significant decrease|  n.


USAGE->
This word is not a standard dictionary word, and thus does not have typical grammatical usage in the same way as common verbs or nouns. Its usage depends entirely on the context in which it appears.  The "rises" part of the compound noun acts like a verb, implying an upward movement. The "half" part modifies the degree of that movement.  Therefore, tense and voice are determined by the sentence's structure.


PHRASE->
This term doesn't readily lend itself to common phrases. Its meaning is context-specific and descriptive.  It would be used within a larger sentence or phrase rather than as a standalone expression.
