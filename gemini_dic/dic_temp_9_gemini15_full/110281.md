ligand: /ˈlɪɡænd/ | n. | 配体，配基 | A ligand is an ion or molecule that binds to a central metal atom to form a coordination complex.  Ligands donate a pair of electrons to the metal atom, forming a coordinate covalent bond. They are crucial in many biological processes and chemical reactions. | Example:  Oxygen is a ligand in hemoglobin, binding to the iron atom. 氧气是血红蛋白中的配体，与铁原子结合。|近义词：complexing agent, chelator |反义词：None specifically, but  "free" ion or molecule could be considered an antonym in context.


USAGE->

词源:
The word "ligand" comes from the Latin word "ligare," meaning "to bind."  It reflects the fundamental function of a ligand: to bind to another molecule or atom.
