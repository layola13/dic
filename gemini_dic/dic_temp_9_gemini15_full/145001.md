The word "overacutenesses" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism or a misspelling.  It's likely an attempt to create a word suggesting an excessive degree of acuteness or sharpness, perhaps in a metaphorical sense.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  To provide a meaningful response, we need to understand the intended meaning or context in which this word was used.  If you can provide more context, I can offer a possible interpretation and analysis.
