meioses:/maɪˈoʊsiːz/| n.|减数分裂|The process of cell division in sexually reproducing organisms that reduces the number of chromosomes in the parent cell by half and produces four gametes (sex cells).  It is essential for sexual reproduction because it ensures that the offspring have the correct number of chromosomes.|例句：Meiosis is a fundamental process in the reproduction of sexually reproducing organisms. 减数分裂是性生殖生物繁殖的基本过程。|例句：Errors during meiosis can lead to genetic abnormalities. 减数分裂过程中的错误可能导致基因异常。|近义词：gametogenesis|反义词：mitosis
