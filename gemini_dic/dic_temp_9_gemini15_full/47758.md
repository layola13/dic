decameric:/dekˈæmərɪk/| adj. |十聚体的；由十个亚基组成的|  Describing a structure composed of ten subunits or monomers.  It is often used in biochemistry to describe proteins or other macromolecules.  | Example: The decameric structure of the enzyme was revealed by X-ray crystallography.  该酶的十聚体结构通过X射线晶体学揭示。|近义词：decuple (in the context of structure), ten-membered|反义词：monomeric (single subunit), dimeric (two subunits)


USAGE->
