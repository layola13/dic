词源:  The word "kiddied" is derived from the noun "kid," meaning a young goat or child.  The verb form is a back-formation, meaning it was created by removing the "-ing" suffix from a previously existing word (likely "kidding," though not strictly in the sense of joking).  Its usage as a verb reflects a playful extension of the noun's meaning.
