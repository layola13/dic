词源:

The word "contemporary" comes from the Middle French word *contemporain*, which itself derives from the Latin words *con* (meaning "together" or "with") and *temporarius* (meaning "of time").  Thus, the word literally means "of the same time."


用法说明:

Contemporary can be used as an adjective to describe things that exist or happen at the same time, particularly referring to the present time or a recent period.  It can also be used as a noun, though less frequently, to refer to a person living or existing at the same time as another, or a person belonging to the same period.


例句：

* **As an adjective describing a time period:**  The museum has a fantastic collection of contemporary paintings. （博物馆收藏了大量的当代绘画作品。）


* **As an adjective describing a person:**  He is a contemporary composer known for his innovative use of technology. （他是一位当代作曲家，以其创新的技术运用而闻名。）

近义词和反义词：

注意：While often used interchangeably with "modern," "contemporary" sometimes implies a slightly narrower timeframe, often suggesting a more direct connection to the current era.  "Modern" can encompass a broader historical period.
