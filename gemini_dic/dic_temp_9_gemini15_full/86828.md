hematomas:/ˌhiːməˈtoʊməz/| n. |血肿，瘀血 | A hematoma is a collection of blood outside of blood vessels.  It occurs because of a break in the wall of a blood vessel, allowing blood to seep into the surrounding tissues. Hematomas can vary in size, from small to large, and can occur anywhere in the body.  They are often caused by trauma, but can also result from medical procedures or spontaneous bleeding. |例句：The patient presented with a large hematoma on his forehead after the fall.  病人摔倒后额头上出现了一个大的血肿。

The boxer suffered a severe hematoma to his eye after a brutal punch. 拳击手遭到重拳击打后眼睛严重血肿。|近义词：bruise, contusion, hemorrhage |反义词：None specifically, but terms indicating the absence of bleeding could be considered antonyms, such as "normal tissue integrity".|名词
