USAGE->
This word is largely historical and doesn't lend itself to common grammatical tense usage in modern English.  The word itself describes a role or position, not an action.  Therefore, examples of different tenses are not applicable.  Instead, we can demonstrate usage in different sentence structures:


Simple Sentence:
The septemvir announced the results of the election.  七人委员会成员宣布了选举结果。


Complex Sentence:
Because the septemvir was ill, the meeting was postponed.  因为七人委员会成员生病了，会议被推迟了。


Compound Sentence:
The septemvir made the decision, and the people protested. 七人委员会成员做出了决定，人们抗议了。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "septemvir".  The word itself is quite specialized and limited in application.
