The word "overpersecute" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It seems to be a neologism (a newly coined word) or a misspelling.  It likely combines "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great extent) with "persecute" (to harass or annoy persistently).

Therefore, a detailed analysis following your requested format is not possible.  However, we can analyze its potential meaning and components separately.

**over-:** /ˈoʊvər/ | prefix |过度地，过于 |  Indicates an excess or going beyond a limit.  | Example: overworked (过度劳累) |  No antonym as a prefix, depends on the word it modifies. | prefix

**persecute:** /ˈpɜːrsɪkjuːt/ | v. |迫害，烦扰 | To harass or annoy persistently.  To subject to hostility or ill-treatment, especially because of race, religion, or beliefs. | Example: They were persecuted for their religious beliefs. 他们因为宗教信仰而受到迫害。 |  近义词: oppress, harass, torment, victimize | 反义词: protect, defend, aid, support | verb


If "overpersecute" were to be used, it would likely mean to persecute excessively or to a greater extent than is considered normal or justifiable.  However, its lack of established usage makes its precise meaning and grammatical function ambiguous.
