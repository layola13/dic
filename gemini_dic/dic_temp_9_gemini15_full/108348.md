词源:  From "lavender" + "-ed".  "Lavender" itself originates from the Old French *lavandre, from Latin lavandula,  ultimately from the Proto-Italic *lauandiula,  of uncertain origin, possibly related to lavare "to wash" (suggesting its use in washing).  The "-ed" suffix is a common English participle suffix indicating a past participle or adjectival form.
