词源：

The word "semi-conscious" is a combination of the prefix "semi-" meaning "half" or "partially," and the adjective "conscious," derived from the Latin word "conscius" meaning "knowing together" or "aware."  Therefore, "semi-conscious" literally means "partially aware."


USAGE->

(Since "semi-conscious" is an adjective, it doesn't have verb conjugations like the example word "what.")  It modifies nouns.
