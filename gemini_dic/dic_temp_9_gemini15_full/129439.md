non-abelian:/ˌnɒn eɪˈbiːliən/| adj. |非阿贝尔的|Describing a group (in abstract algebra) where the order of operations matters; that is, the group operation is not commutative.  In simpler terms,  for elements a and b in a non-abelian group, a * b is not necessarily equal to b * a.  This contrasts with abelian groups, where the order of operations does not matter.|例句：The group of rotations in three-dimensional space is a non-abelian group. 三维空间中的旋转群是一个非阿贝尔群。


例句：Many important groups in physics, such as the symmetry groups of particles, are non-abelian.  许多物理学中重要的群，例如粒子的对称群，都是非阿贝尔群。

USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the context of abstract algebra and related fields like group theory and physics.  It doesn't have common usage in everyday conversation. Therefore, providing examples across various tenses and moods is not applicable.  The word's use is primarily declarative.


PHRASE->
non-abelian group: 非阿贝尔群
non-abelian gauge theory: 非阿贝尔规范理论

词源:
The term "non-abelian" is derived from the name of the Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829). Abel made significant contributions to the study of groups, particularly those where the group operation is commutative (abelian groups).  The term "non-abelian" is simply a descriptor indicating groups that *do not* possess this commutative property.
