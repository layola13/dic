deconstructors:/ˌdiːkənˈstrʌktərz/ | n. |析构函数，解构器 | A deconstructor is a special method in object-oriented programming that is automatically called when an object is destroyed. It is used to release resources held by the object, such as memory or file handles.  | Example: In C++, the deconstructor for a class is typically named with a tilde (~) before the class name.  For example, if you have a class named `MyClass`, its deconstructor would be `~MyClass()`.  This ensures that when a `MyClass` object is no longer needed, its resources are properly released. |  Destructor, finalizer | Constructor | n.


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the context of programming and doesn't have typical verb conjugations like "to be" or grammatical structures common in everyday language.  Therefore, standard tense conjugations (present, past, future, etc.) are not applicable.  The usage is always within the context of programming code.

Example 1:
`MyClass::~MyClass() { // Release resources here }` =  `MyClass` 的析构函数在这里释放资源。

Example 2:
`The deconstructor ensures that the allocated memory is freed.` =  析构函数确保已分配的内存被释放。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly involving "deconstructors" outside of programming contexts.  The usage is highly technical and specific to computer science.
