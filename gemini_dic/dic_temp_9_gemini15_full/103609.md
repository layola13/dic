USAGE->

This word, "jointedness's", is unusual and grammatically questionable.  It is the possessive form of "jointedness," creating a noun phrase.  Therefore, standard grammatical tense conjugations, etc., do not directly apply.  Its usage would fall within the context of a sentence exhibiting possession, or a sentence describing a characteristic of something.  Examples would require careful construction to fit its meaning:


Example 1 (Possessive):

The chair's jointedness's  durability was surprising. (The durability of the chair's jointedness was surprising.) 椅子关节的耐用性令人惊讶。


Example 2 (Descriptive):
