four-dimensional:/ˌfɔːrdaɪˈmɛnʃənəl/| adj. |四维的；四维空间的 |  Having four dimensions, especially length, breadth, height, and time.  This term is often used in mathematics, physics, and theoretical contexts to describe spaces or objects that extend beyond the three spatial dimensions we experience in everyday life. The addition of time as a fourth dimension is a key concept in relativity. | Example:  Einstein's theory of relativity describes a four-dimensional spacetime. 爱因斯坦的相对论描述了一个四维时空。


The concept of four dimensions is often visualized through analogies, such as a three-dimensional being observing a two-dimensional world.  A four-dimensional object would be incredibly difficult for a three-dimensional being to fully comprehend. |近义词: four-space, hyperspatial (in some contexts)|反义词: two-dimensional, three-dimensional | adj.
