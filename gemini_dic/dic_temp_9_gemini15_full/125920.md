词源:

The word "museumish" is a relatively recent coinage, formed by adding the suffix "-ish" to "museum." The suffix "-ish"  creates adjectives suggesting a resemblance or approximation to the base word, often with a slightly informal or pejorative tone.  Therefore, "museumish" implies a resemblance to a museum, but not exactly being one, often implying some of the less desirable aspects associated with museums.  There's no classical etymology tracing it back to ancient roots like many other words; its creation is a straightforward modern derivation.
