词源:  The word "nonheroicness" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the noun "heroicness," which itself is derived from the adjective "heroic" (from "hero").  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying a quality or state.  Therefore, "nonheroicness" literally means "the state of not being heroic."
