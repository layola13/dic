The results showed the cells were nonsecretionary. = 结果表明这些细胞是非分泌性的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have confirmed the nonsecretionary nature of the cells. = 科学家已经证实了这些细胞的非分泌性质。
The study has revealed that the gland is nonsecretionary. = 研究表明该腺体是非分泌性的。


过去完成时:
Researchers had already identified the tissue as nonsecretionary. = 研究人员此前已将该组织鉴定为非分泌性的。
It had been previously established that the cells were nonsecretionary. = 早已确定这些细胞是非分泌性的。


将来时:
The experiment will likely show the cells to be nonsecretionary. = 实验可能会显示这些细胞是非分泌性的。
Future research will clarify whether the tissue is nonsecretionary. = 未来的研究将阐明该组织是否是非分泌性的。


虚拟语气:
If the cells were nonsecretionary, the results would be different. = 如果这些细胞是非分泌性的，结果就会不同。

The tissue was classified as nonsecretionary. = 该组织被归类为非分泌性的。
The cells were found to be nonsecretionary. = 发现这些细胞是非分泌性的。


疑问句:
Is the gland nonsecretionary? = 该腺体是非分泌性的吗？
Are these cells truly nonsecretionary? = 这些细胞真的是非分泌性的吗？


否定句:
The cells are not nonsecretionary; they actively secrete hormones. = 这些细胞不是非分泌性的；它们积极分泌激素。
The gland is not nonsecretionary; it produces mucus. = 该腺体并非非分泌性的；它产生粘液。
