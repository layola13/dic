globulite:/ˈɡlɒbjʊlaɪt/| n. |球粒陨石|A globulite is a small, spherical or subspherical inclusion found in some igneous rocks, particularly those formed from volcanic eruptions. They are typically composed of volcanic glass or mineral aggregates and often have a concentric structure. Their formation is still debated, but theories involve rapid cooling and degassing of lava or the aggregation of small particles within a volcanic plume.  |Example: The petrographic analysis revealed the presence of numerous globules within the volcanic rock sample.|近义词: spherulite, nodule|反义词:  None specifically, but terms like "fragmental" or "angular" describe contrasting textures.|名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in geology and petrology, so tense usage reflects scientific descriptions and analyses.  Therefore,  present simple is most common.

一般现在时:
Globules are often found in volcanic rocks. = 球粒通常存在于火山岩中。
The analysis reveals numerous globules in this sample. = 分析显示该样本中有很多球粒。


一般过去时:
Researchers identified several globules during the field study. = 研究人员在野外考察中发现了几个球粒。
The formation of the globules was attributed to rapid cooling. = 球粒的形成归因于快速冷却。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered many different types of globules. = 科学家们已经发现了许多不同类型的球粒。
Studies have shown that globulite formation is complex. = 研究表明球粒的形成是复杂的。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, the presence of globules was unknown. = 在分析之前，球粒的存在是未知的。
They had already observed similar globules in previous samples. = 他们之前已经在之前的样本中观察到类似的球粒。


将来时:
Future research will investigate the exact formation mechanisms of globules. = 未来的研究将调查球粒的确切形成机制。
We will analyze the composition of the globules using advanced techniques. = 我们将使用先进的技术分析球粒的成分。


虚拟语气:
If the globules were larger, they would be easier to identify. = 如果球粒更大，它们就更容易识别。
It is hypothesized that if cooling was slower, different structures would form. = 假设如果冷却速度较慢，就会形成不同的结构。


被动语态:
The globules were carefully examined under a microscope. = 球粒在显微镜下被仔细检查。
The origin of the globules is still being debated. = 球粒的起源仍在争论中。


疑问句:
What is the chemical composition of these globules? = 这些球粒的化学成分是什么？
How did these globules form? = 这些球粒是如何形成的？


否定句:
These globules do not show any signs of crystallization. = 这些球粒没有显示任何结晶迹象。
The sample did not contain any large globules. = 样本中没有任何大型球粒。


PHRASE->
There are limited common phrases directly using "globulite," as it's a specialized term.  Phrases would focus on its properties or context:

globulite size and shape = 球粒的尺寸和形状
globulite distribution pattern = 球粒的分布模式
globulite chemical composition = 球粒的化学成分
analysis of globules = 球粒分析
presence of globules = 球粒的存在
