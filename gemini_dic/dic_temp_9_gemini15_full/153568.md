pentahydrated: /ˌpɛnˈtaɪdreɪtɪd/ | adj. | 五水合的 |  Containing five molecules of water of crystallization.  This term is typically used to describe a chemical compound that incorporates five water molecules into its crystalline structure.  The water molecules are not chemically bonded to the compound but are held within its lattice.  This hydration can significantly affect the compound's properties, such as its solubility and stability. | Example:  Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate is a common example of a pentahydrated compound.  | 近义词:  (None directly equivalent, descriptive phrases needed like "containing five water molecules") | 反义词: anhydrous | 词性:形容词
