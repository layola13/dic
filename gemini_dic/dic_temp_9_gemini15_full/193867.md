词源:

The word is a compound of "self-" (meaning oneself) and "discriminations" (the act of making distinctions, often unfairly).  The root of "discrimination" lies in the Latin word "discriminare," meaning "to distinguish, separate."  Therefore, "self-discrimination" literally means "making distinctions against oneself."
