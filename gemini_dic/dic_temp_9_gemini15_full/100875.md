The word "intrudress" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a detailed analysis following your requested format.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or fictional context.  If you could provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer some educated guesses about its intended meaning.
