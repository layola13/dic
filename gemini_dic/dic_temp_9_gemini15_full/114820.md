词源:

The word "mameluco" originates from the Spanish language. Its etymology is not definitively settled, but the most widely accepted theory traces it back to the Arabic word "mamlūk" (مملوك), meaning "slave" or "owned person."  During the medieval period, Mamelukes were a powerful military caste in Egypt and other parts of the Middle East, often associated with certain types of clothing.  Over time, the Spanish word "mameluco" evolved to refer to various types of loose-fitting clothing, and the connection to its Arabic origin has become obscured.  In some Latin American countries, it retains a connotation of simple, utilitarian clothing.


用法说明:

The usage of "mameluco" varies geographically.  In some Spanish-speaking regions, it primarily refers to a type of adult jumpsuit, often used in work settings. In other regions, it's more commonly associated with baby rompers or onesies.  Context is key to understanding its precise meaning.
