词源:
The word "escalator" is a trademark coined by the Otis Elevator Company in 1892 for their moving staircase.  It's derived from the verb "escalate," meaning "to increase or intensify," combined with the suffix "-ator," forming a noun meaning "something that escalates" or "a device that moves something upward."  The original meaning was tied to the upward movement of the stairs, hence the choice of the word. Over time, "escalator" has entered general use as the common name for any moving staircase, regardless of brand.
