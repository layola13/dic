词源:
The word "demeanor" comes from the Old French word "demener," meaning "to conduct oneself," "to behave," or "to govern."  This, in turn, is related to the Latin word "minari," meaning "to threaten" or "to project."  While the modern meaning of "demeanor" is far removed from the sense of threat, the original root implies a certain outward projection of self.
