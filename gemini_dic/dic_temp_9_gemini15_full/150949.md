词源:

The word "paralytically" is derived from the adjective "paralytic," which itself originates from the Greek word "paralytikos," meaning "affected with paralysis."  "Paralysis" comes from the Greek "paralysis," a combination of "para-" (beside, beyond) and "lysis" (loosening, solution).  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating manner or way.
