**hongcha (红茶):**

This is the Mandarin Chinese term for black tea.  The pronunciation is approximately /ˈhʊŋtʃɑː/.  It's a compound word:

* **红 (hóng):**  red (adjective)
* **茶 (chá):** tea (noun)

The use of "red" in the Chinese term is historical and relates to the color of the oxidized leaves *before* they are fully dried and become dark brown or black.  The term translates directly as "red tea," which is sometimes used in English but is less common than "black tea."
