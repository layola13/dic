词源:
The word "depressurize" is a modern coinage, formed by combining the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse") with "pressurize" (itself a relatively recent word).  "Pressurize" combines "pressure" (from Latin *pressura, "a pressing") and the suffix "-ize" (meaning "to make or become").  Therefore, "depressurize" ultimately derives from the Latin root "pressura."
