PHRASE->
Because "renotations" is a relatively uncommon word, common phrases using it are limited.  Phrases would revolve around the act of renaming, and would be better expressed using "renaming" instead. For example:  "a series of renotations," "a plan for renotations," "the process of renotations".  These are essentially descriptions of the renaming process rather than established phrases.
