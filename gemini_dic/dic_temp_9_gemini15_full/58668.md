The word "dummador" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific dialect or jargon, or a proper noun.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.
