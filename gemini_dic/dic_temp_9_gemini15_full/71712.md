词源:  The word "flavourer" is derived from the noun "flavour" (or "flavor" in American English), meaning the taste or smell of something. The suffix "-er" is an agentive suffix, indicating a person or thing that performs an action or has a specific function. Thus, a "flavourer" is something that adds flavour.  The word's origins trace back to Old French *flavor, and ultimately to Latin *flavor-.
