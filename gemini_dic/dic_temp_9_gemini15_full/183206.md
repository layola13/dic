近义词：representability,  representation,  expressibility


反义词：unrepresentability, inexpressibility


词源:

The word "representability" is derived from the verb "represent" and the suffix "-ability".  "Represent" comes from the Old French "representer," ultimately from the Latin "repraesentare," meaning "to present again," "to represent," or "to portray."  The prefix "re-" means "again" or "back," and "praesentare" is composed of "prae-" ("before," "in front of") and "praesentare" ("to present").  The suffix "-ability" denotes the capacity or potential for something.
