phototheodolite: /ˌfoʊtoʊθiˈɒdəlaɪt/ | n. |摄影经纬仪| A phototheodolite is a surveying instrument combining a theodolite with a camera, used to take photographs for photogrammetry.  It precisely records the position and orientation of each photograph, allowing for the creation of accurate three-dimensional models from overlapping images. | Example: The engineers used a phototheodolite to capture images for creating a detailed 3D model of the bridge.  工程师使用摄影经纬仪拍摄图像，以创建桥梁的详细 3D 模型。 | 近义词: photogrammetric camera, aerial camera (in some contexts) | 反义词:  None directly, but terms like "hand-held camera" could be considered opposites in terms of precision and application.

词源:
The word "phototheodolite" is a compound word, combining:

* **photo-:**  From Greek *phos* (φῶς), meaning "light," indicating the photographic aspect.
* **theo-:** From Greek *theos* (θεός), meaning "god," but in this context referring to "viewing" or "looking" (as in "theodolite").
* **-dolite:** From Greek *dolite* (δόλιχος), meaning "a long thing," or "a rod" (referring to the sighting apparatus).  The term "theodolite" itself evolved through various languages and forms.

Therefore, the word literally means an instrument that uses light (photography) for viewing (precise aiming) using a long rod-like apparatus.
