词源：The word "prespreads" is a compound word formed from the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the verb "spreads" (the present tense of the verb "to spread," meaning "to distribute or disseminate").  Therefore, it literally means "spreading before."  The term is a relatively recent coinage, emerging from the need to describe pre-release marketing and promotional activities.
