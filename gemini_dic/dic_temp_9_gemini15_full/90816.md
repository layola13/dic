词源:  The word "humungous" is a relatively recent addition to the English language. It's considered a blend or portmanteau word, combining elements of "huge" and possibly "monster" or a similar word suggesting immense size. While its exact etymology is debated, it clearly reflects a desire for a more emphatic and informal term than simply "huge."  Its first recorded use dates back to the mid-20th century.
