词源:
The word "cooky" is a variant spelling of "cookie," which ultimately derives from the Dutch word "koekje," a diminutive of "koek," meaning "cake."  The diminutive suffix "-je" indicates smallness.  The word entered English via the Dutch-speaking settlers of New Amsterdam (New York).  Over time, "cooky" became a common alternative spelling, particularly in American English.
