词源:
The word "misaffected" comes from the Old French "mesaffecter," which combines the prefix "mes-" (meaning "badly" or "wrongly") with the verb "affecter," meaning "to affect" or "to influence."  The meaning has evolved over time to encompass both the sense of being negatively influenced and the more modern connotation of artificiality and discontent.
