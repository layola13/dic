preextinguished: /ˌpriːɪkˈstɪŋɡwɪʃt/ | adj. | 预先扑灭的；预先熄灭的 |  Previously extinguished; put out beforehand.  This word is a relatively rare and mainly theoretical construction formed by combining "pre-" (before) and "extinguished" (put out, quenched). It suggests something was extinguished before a particular point in time or event. There are no common synonyms or antonyms as the word itself is uncommon.  The word's usage is primarily limited to technical or specialized contexts where a precise description of prior extinguishing is needed.

例句：

The preextinguished fire left only ash. = 预先扑灭的火只留下了灰烬。

The preextinguished flames prevented a larger blaze. = 预先熄灭的火焰阻止了更大的火灾。
