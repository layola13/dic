The word "friston" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information following the requested format.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (perhaps a place name), or a neologism (newly coined word).  More context is needed to determine its meaning.
