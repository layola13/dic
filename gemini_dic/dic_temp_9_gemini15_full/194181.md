self-ionization:/ˌsɛlfˌaɪənaɪˈzeɪʃən/| n. |自电离；自身电离|The process by which a molecule spontaneously dissociates into ions, typically in a pure liquid. This often involves the transfer of a proton (H+) from one molecule to another.  For example, water undergoes self-ionization to produce hydronium ions (H3O+) and hydroxide ions (OH−).|Example: The self-ionization of water is crucial for understanding its acidic and basic properties.|近义词：autoionization, autoprotolysis|反义词：N/A
