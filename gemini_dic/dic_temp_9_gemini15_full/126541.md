词源:
The word "nachos" is derived from the name Ignacio "Nacho" Anaya, a Mexican restaurateur who is credited with inventing the dish in the 1940s.  He created the dish spontaneously to satisfy a group of hungry American soldiers' wives at his restaurant in Piedras Negras, Coahuila, Mexico.  The name evolved from his nickname, "Nacho," to become associated with the dish itself.
