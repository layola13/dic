反义词：stabilization, maintenance, preservation


词源:

* **re-:** prefix meaning "again" or "back"
* **configur-:** from Latin "configurare," meaning "to form," "to shape," or "to arrange."  This ultimately derives from "con-" (together) and "figurare" (to shape).
* **-ation:** suffix forming nouns of action or process.

Therefore, "reconfigurations" literally means "the act of shaping or arranging again."
