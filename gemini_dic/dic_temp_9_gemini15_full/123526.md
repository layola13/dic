词源：

The word derives from the adjective "monotonous," which itself comes from the Greek words "monos" (single, one) and "tonos" (tone, sound).  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality. The final "-es" indicates the plural form.


用法说明：

"Monotonousnesses" is used to emphasize the multiplicity of instances of monotony.  While you could use "monotony" in most cases, "monotonousnesses" highlights the numerous, distinct aspects of the dullness or repetitiveness.  It's a less common word and often feels more emphatic or even slightly literary.  Using it requires a context where multiple facets of monotony are relevant.
