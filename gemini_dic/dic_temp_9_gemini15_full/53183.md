词源:The word "dipsetic" is derived from the Greek words "dipsas" (δίψας), meaning "thirst," and "-etic" (-ητικός), a suffix denoting "pertaining to" or "characterized by."  While seemingly unrelated to anger, the original connection is believed to be through the association of intense thirst with irritability and frustration.  The sense evolved over time to its current meaning.
