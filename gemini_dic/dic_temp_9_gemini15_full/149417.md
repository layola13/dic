packeting:/ˈpækɪtɪŋ/ | n. |分组打包；分组传输；分组;数据包化|The process of dividing data into packets for transmission over a network.  This involves breaking down large amounts of data into smaller, manageable units for easier handling and transmission.  Each packet contains data, addressing information (source and destination), and error-checking mechanisms.|例句：The efficient packeting of data is crucial for high-speed network communication. 高效的数据分组对于高速网络通信至关重要。

The network relies on robust packeting protocols to ensure data integrity. 该网络依赖于强大的分组协议来确保数据完整性。|近义词：segmentation, fragmentation, bundling |反义词：stream transmission (continuous transmission without packet division)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The system constantly performs packeting. = 系统不断进行分组。
Efficient packeting is key to network performance. = 高效的分组是网络性能的关键。

一般过去时:
The engineer implemented a new packeting algorithm. = 工程师实施了一种新的分组算法。
They completed the packeting process successfully. = 他们成功完成了分组过程。

现在完成时:
The network has improved its packeting efficiency. = 网络已经提高了其分组效率。
We have successfully implemented the packeting protocol. = 我们已经成功实施了分组协议。

过去完成时:
The data had been packeted before transmission. = 数据在传输前已完成分组。
They had already finished packeting the large file. = 他们已经完成了对大型文件的打包。

将来时:
The new software will optimize packeting. = 新软件将优化分组。
They will implement a more efficient packeting method. = 他们将实施一种更高效的分组方法。

虚拟语气:
If the packeting were more efficient, the network would be faster. = 如果分组更有效率，网络速度就会更快。
I wish the packeting process were less complex. = 我希望分组过程不那么复杂。

被动语态:
The data is packeted by the router. = 数据由路由器进行分组。
A new packeting algorithm is being developed. = 一种新的分组算法正在开发中。

疑问句:
What type of packeting is being used? = 正在使用哪种分组？
How does the system handle packeting errors? = 系统如何处理分组错误？

否定句:
The system does not support this type of packeting. = 系统不支持这种分组。
They did not implement the correct packeting protocol. = 他们没有实施正确的分组协议。


PHRASE->
data packeting = 数据分组
network packeting = 网络分组
packet packeting = 数据包分组 (指将数据包进一步分组)
IP packeting = IP分组
UDP packeting = UDP分组
