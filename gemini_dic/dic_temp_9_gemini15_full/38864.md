词源:

The word "confederation" comes from the Late Latin word *confederatio*, a combination of *con-* (together) and *foedus* (treaty, league, covenant).  The suffix "-tion" is a noun-forming suffix indicating the act or process of.  Therefore, the word fundamentally signifies the act of forming a league or alliance.
