pseudocubic:/ˌsuːdoʊˈkjuːbɪk/| adj.|伪立方的，似立方的|Appearing cubic but not truly cubic; exhibiting approximate cubic symmetry.  This term is often used in crystallography to describe a crystal system that is nearly cubic, but deviates slightly from perfect cubic symmetry due to slight distortions in the lattice structure.  |例句：The mineral displayed pseudocubic habit, showing near-cubic external form but lacking true cubic symmetry internally.|近义词：quasi-cubic, nearly cubic|反义词：cubic, truly cubic


USAGE->
This word is primarily used as an adjective, describing a characteristic or property.  Therefore, verb conjugations and other tense forms are not applicable.  The usage remains consistent across different sentence structures.

Example Sentences:

Declarative: The crystal structure was identified as pseudocubic. = 晶体结构被鉴定为伪立方的。
The mineral exhibited a pseudocubic habit. = 这种矿物表现出伪立方晶习。


Interrogative: Is the symmetry of this crystal pseudocubic? = 这个晶体的对称性是伪立方的吗？
Could the observed structure be described as pseudocubic? = 观察到的结构可以描述为伪立方吗？


Negative: The structure is not truly cubic; it's pseudocubic. = 结构并非真正立方体；它是伪立方的。
The analysis showed that the crystal was not pseudocubic, but orthorhombic. = 分析表明晶体不是伪立方的，而是正交的。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly incorporating "pseudocubic."  The term is highly specialized within its field of crystallography.
