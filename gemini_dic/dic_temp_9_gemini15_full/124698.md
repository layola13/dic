The word "mowburn" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It may be a neologism (newly coined word), a misspelling, a regional dialect word, or a proper noun.  To provide an analysis, further context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (a book, a website, a conversation, etc.)
* **What was the context of its use?** (This will help determine its intended meaning.)

Without this information, any analysis would be speculative and inaccurate.
