polyhedron:/ˌpɒliˈhiːdrən/ /ˌpɑːliˈhiːdrən/| n. |多面体|A polyhedron is a three-dimensional geometric shape with flat polygonal faces, straight edges, and sharp corners or vertices.  It is a solid figure with many sides. |Example: A cube is a type of polyhedron.  一个立方体是一种多面体。  A soccer ball is an example of a truncated icosahedron. 足球是一个截角二十面体的例子。|近义词：geometric solid, multifaceted figure |反义词：sphere (a completely round three-dimensional object)
