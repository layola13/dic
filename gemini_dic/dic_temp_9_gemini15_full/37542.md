词源:
The word "commonplace" originates from the Middle English "comonplace,"  itself derived from the Old French "común plaç," literally meaning "common place."  The "place" here refers to a shared location or position, and thus, a shared, frequently occurring thing or idea.  The evolution reflects the shift from a literal meaning of "common place" to the figurative sense of something ordinary or unoriginal.
