词源:
The word "fussy" (from which "fussiest" is derived) comes from an obsolete word "fuss," meaning a commotion or disturbance.  This older "fuss" ultimately derives from a Middle Dutch word meaning "to blow."  The meaning evolved to encompass being overly concerned with minor details, leading to the modern adjective's meaning of being excessively particular or meticulous.
