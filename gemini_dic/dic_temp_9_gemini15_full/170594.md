WORD ORIGIN->

* **pseudo-**:  From Greek *pseudēs* meaning "false," "lying," or "sham."
* **educational**: From "education," ultimately from Latin *ēducātiō* meaning "a bringing up," "a rearing," "training," or "instruction."


Therefore, "pseudo-educational" literally means "falsely educational" or "sham education."
