词源:

The word "reasonableness" is derived from the adjective "reasonable," which itself comes from the Old French "resnable" and ultimately from the Latin "rationabilis," meaning "capable of being reasoned."  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix used to form nouns from adjectives, denoting a quality or state.
