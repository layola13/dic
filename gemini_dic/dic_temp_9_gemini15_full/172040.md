词源:

Derived from "purist" + "-istic," the suffix indicating "relating to" or "characteristic of."  "Purist" itself originates from "pure" (meaning free from contaminants or impurities) + "-ist," a suffix forming nouns denoting a person who adheres to a particular doctrine, practice, etc.  Therefore, the word's root lies in the concept of purity and the desire to maintain it.
