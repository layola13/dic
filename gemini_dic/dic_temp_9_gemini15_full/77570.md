词源:

The phrase "gearing up" originates from the mechanical function of gears.  Gears interlock to transmit power, and the act of "gearing up" initially referred to the mechanical process of engaging gears to increase speed or power. This mechanical sense metaphorically extended to refer to the process of preparing for action, similar to how a machine is prepared for operation by engaging its gears.
