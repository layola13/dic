词源:
The word "palace" ultimately derives from the Latin word "palatium," which referred to the Palatine Hill in Rome, one of the seven hills upon which the city was built.  The Palatine Hill was the site of several Roman emperors' palaces, and the word "palatium" came to be associated with grand residences in general.  Through Old French ("palais"), the word entered English.
