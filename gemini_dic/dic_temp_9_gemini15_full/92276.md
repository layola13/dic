PHRASE->
Because "hypervoluminously" is an adverb, it doesn't form common phrases in the same way as "what".  Instead, it modifies verbs and describes the manner of actions.  Here are examples of its use with different verbs:


Hypervoluminously described:  大量地描述
Hypervoluminously documented:  大量地记录
Hypervoluminously produced:  大量地生产
Hypervoluminously written:  大量地书写

Etymology:

The word is formed from:

* **hyper-**:  (prefix) meaning "above," "beyond," "excessive" (from Greek ὑπέρ, *hupér*)
* **voluminous**: (adjective) meaning "of great volume or size" (from Latin *volumen*, a rolled-up scroll)
* **-ly**: (suffix) forming adverbs from adjectives

Therefore, "hypervoluminously" literally means "in an excessively voluminous manner".
