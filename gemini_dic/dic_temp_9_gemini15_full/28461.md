carburising: /ˈkɑːrbəraɪzɪŋ/ | v. |渗碳，渗碳处理 | The process of increasing the carbon content of the surface of steel or iron by heating it in a carburizing atmosphere. This process makes the surface harder and more wear-resistant.  | Example: The gears were carburising to improve their durability.  齿轮经过渗碳处理以提高其耐用性。 | 近义词: case hardening, surface hardening | 反义词: decarburization


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The factory carburises steel components daily. = 工厂每天都对钢制部件进行渗碳处理。
They carburising the tools to enhance their hardness. = 他们正在对工具进行渗碳处理以增强其硬度。


一般过去时:
The engineer carburised the parts before assembly. = 工程师在组装前对零件进行了渗碳处理。
We carburised the steel to increase its surface hardness. = 我们对钢材进行了渗碳处理以提高其表面硬度。


现在完成时:

将来时:
The plant will carburise the new batch of parts tomorrow. = 工厂明天将对新一批零件进行渗碳处理。
We will carburise the shafts to improve their wear resistance. = 我们将对轴进行渗碳处理以提高其耐磨性。


虚拟语气:
If we carburised the gears, they would last longer. = 如果我们对齿轮进行渗碳处理，它们的寿命会更长。
I wish we had carburised those parts earlier. = 我真希望我们早点对那些零件进行渗碳处理。


被动语态:
The steel was carburised in a controlled atmosphere furnace. = 钢材是在一个受控气氛炉中进行渗碳处理的。
The parts are being carburised at high temperature. = 零件正在高温下进行渗碳处理。


疑问句:
Have they carburised all the components yet? = 他们已经对所有部件进行渗碳处理了吗？
Will the parts be carburised before shipment? = 零件会在发货前进行渗碳处理吗？


否定句:
They did not carburise the tools properly. = 他们没有正确地对工具进行渗碳处理。
The process did not carburise the steel sufficiently. = 该工艺没有充分地对钢材进行渗碳处理。
