diatom:/ˈdaɪətɒm/| n. |硅藻|A single-celled alga containing chlorophyll and living in fresh or salt water. Diatoms have cell walls made of silica and are a major component of phytoplankton.|例句：Diatoms are microscopic algae that form a crucial part of the marine food web.  硅藻是形成海洋食物网重要组成部分的微观藻类。|例句：The sediment sample contained a high concentration of diatomaceous earth, indicating a past aquatic environment.沉淀物样本含有高浓度的硅藻土，表明过去存在水生环境。|近义词：phytoplankton, algae|反义词:N/A
