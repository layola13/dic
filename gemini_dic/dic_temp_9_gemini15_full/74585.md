词源:
The word "frazzle" is believed to be of uncertain origin, possibly from a combination of the verb "fray" (to unravel or wear away) and a suffix suggesting intensity or completeness.  Its use as a verb and adjective describing exhaustion and irritation seems to have developed relatively recently in the English language.
