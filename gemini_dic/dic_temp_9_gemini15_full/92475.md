hypotarsus:/ˌhaɪpəˈtɑːrsəs/| n. |跗跖骨；后跗骨|The hypotarsus is a thickened area on the back of the tarsus of many birds, often associated with a spur.  It provides an area for muscle attachment and contributes to the bird's powerful leg movements.  The term is primarily used in ornithology.|Example: The sharp spur on the hypotarsus of the rooster was a formidable weapon.|近义词：tarsal spur (in context), calcaneum (anatomically related)|反义词：无
