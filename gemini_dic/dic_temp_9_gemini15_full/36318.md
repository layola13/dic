词源:

The word "cohort" ultimately derives from the Latin word "cohors," which referred to a military unit in the Roman army.  This unit was typically composed of 300-600 men, and often served as a crucial part of a larger legion. Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass any group of people sharing a common characteristic or experience.
