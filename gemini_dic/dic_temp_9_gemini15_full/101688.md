近义词：unforgiveness, persistence, relentlessness|反义词：remission, forgiveness, abatement


词源：  The word is derived from the prefix "ir-" (meaning "not") and the noun "remission," which itself comes from the Old French "remission" and ultimately from the Latin "remissio," meaning "a letting go, release, forgiveness."  Therefore, "irremission" literally means "not a letting go" or "not a remission."
