/ˌɪntərˈsæmpəld/ | adj. | 内插的，内插采样的 |  Describes data or a signal that has been created or modified by inserting additional data points between existing ones.  This is often done to increase the sampling rate, improve resolution, or fill in missing data.  | Example: The inter-sampled audio track sounded smoother and clearer.  内插采样的音频轨道听起来更流畅清晰。 | 近义词: interpolated, resampled | 反义词: downsampled
