词源:
The word "preacquisitive" is formed from the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and the word "acquisitive," which comes from the Latin word "acquirere" (to acquire, obtain).  The prefix "pre-" in this context intensifies the meaning of "acquisitive," suggesting an excessive or overzealous desire to acquire.  Therefore, "preacquisitive" implies a more extreme form of acquisitiveness.
