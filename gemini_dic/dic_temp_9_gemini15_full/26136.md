combustion:/kəmˈbʌʃən/ | n. |燃烧，燃烧过程 | The rapid oxidation of a substance, accompanied by the production of heat and light.  Combustion is a chemical process that releases energy in the form of heat and light.  It requires three elements: a fuel, an oxidizer (usually oxygen), and an ignition source. Examples include burning wood, gas, or oil. |The fireplace provided warmth through the combustion of wood.壁炉通过木材燃烧提供温暖。 The engine relies on the combustion of fuel to generate power.发动机依靠燃料燃烧来产生动力。 | ignition, burning | extinction, quenching | 名词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Combustion occurs when a fuel reacts with an oxidizer. = 燃烧发生在燃料与氧化剂反应时。
The engine uses combustion to produce energy. = 发动机利用燃烧产生能量。


一般过去时:
Combustion of the fuel caused a fire. = 燃料的燃烧引起了火灾。
The rapid combustion startled everyone. = 快速的燃烧惊吓了所有人。


现在完成时:
The scientists have studied combustion for years. = 科学家们已经研究燃烧多年了。
They have completed the combustion analysis. = 他们已经完成了燃烧分析。


过去完成时:
The fire had already started before the combustion was detected. = 在检测到燃烧之前，火灾已经开始了。
The engine had experienced incomplete combustion. = 发动机曾经历过不完全燃烧。


将来时:
The experiment will involve controlled combustion. = 实验将涉及受控燃烧。
Scientists will study the effects of combustion on the environment. = 科学家们将研究燃烧对环境的影响。


虚拟语气:
If there were no oxygen, combustion wouldn't occur. = 如果没有氧气，就不会发生燃烧。
I wish I understood the complexities of combustion better. = 我希望我能更好地理解燃烧的复杂性。


被动语态:
The fuel was consumed by combustion. = 燃料被燃烧消耗掉了。
The experiment was designed to study combustion. = 实验的设计目的是研究燃烧。


疑问句:
What causes spontaneous combustion? = 什么原因会导致自燃？
What are the products of combustion? = 燃烧的产物是什么？


否定句:
The engine did not achieve complete combustion. = 发动机没有达到完全燃烧。
There was no evidence of combustion. = 没有燃烧的迹象。


PHRASE->

spontaneous combustion: 自燃
incomplete combustion: 不完全燃烧
internal combustion: 内燃
combustion chamber: 燃烧室
combustion engine: 内燃机
