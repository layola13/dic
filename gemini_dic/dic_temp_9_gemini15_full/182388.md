词源:
The word "renegat" comes from the Old French word "renegat," meaning "apostate," which itself is derived from the Latin "renegare," meaning "to deny again."  The prefix "re-" indicates repetition or reversal, while "negare" means "to deny."  Thus, the original meaning pointed to a repeated denial of faith or belief.
