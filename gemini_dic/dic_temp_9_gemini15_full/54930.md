词源:
The word "dispositioned" comes from the noun "disposition," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "disposition," meaning "arrangement, order, arrangement."  The suffix "-ed" transforms the noun into an adjective, describing something or someone as having a particular disposition.  The root meaning relates to the arrangement or ordering of one's mental or emotional state, leading to the modern understanding of inherent nature or tendency.
