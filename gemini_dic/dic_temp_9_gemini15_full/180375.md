词源:
The word "refuse" comes from the Old French word "refuser," meaning "to reject, refuse."  This, in turn, ultimately derives from the Latin word "refusare," which is a combination of the prefix "re-" (back, again) and "fusare" (to melt, pour).  The original meaning implied a casting back or rejection of something.  The noun sense of "refuse" (meaning waste) developed later.
