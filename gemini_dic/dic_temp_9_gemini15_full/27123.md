词源:
The word "caliph" comes from the Arabic word خَلِيفَة (khalīfah), meaning "successor" or "deputy."  It refers to the successor of the Prophet Muhammad as the political and religious leader of the Muslim community.  The title evolved from the early Islamic community's need to designate a leader after Muhammad's death.
