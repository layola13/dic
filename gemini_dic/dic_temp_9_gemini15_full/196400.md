serotinous:/səˈrɒtɪnəs/| adj. |延迟的；迟发的；晚熟的|  Relating to or denoting plants that retain their seeds for an extended period, often until triggered by a specific environmental cue such as fire. The term often describes seeds that are held in cones or seed pods until a fire or other event causes them to open and release the seeds.  | Example: The serotinous cones of the lodgepole pine only open after a fire, releasing seeds that can then germinate in the ash.  延迟的松果只在火灾后打开，释放出可以在灰烬中发芽的种子。|近义词：delayed, late, retarded | 反义词：early, prompt, immediate

USAGE->

一般现在时:
The seeds remain in the cones; this is a serotinous characteristic. = 种子留在球果中；这是延迟的特性。
This plant exhibits serotinous behavior. = 这种植物表现出延迟的特性。


一般过去时:
The fire triggered the release of the serotinous seeds. = 火灾触发了延迟种子的释放。
The cones remained closed until the past summer's wildfires. = 松果一直关闭到去年夏天的野火。


现在完成时:
The species has evolved a serotinous seed dispersal strategy. = 该物种已经进化出一种延迟的种子传播策略。
The fire has opened many serotinous seed pods. = 火灾已经打开了許多延迟的种子荚。


过去完成时:
Before the fire, the seeds had remained dormant in their serotinous cones. = 在火灾之前，种子一直休眠在延迟的球果中。
The forest had accumulated a large amount of serotinous seeds before the wildfire. = 在野火之前，森林已经积累了大量的延迟种子。


将来时:
The serotinous seeds will germinate after the fire. = 延迟的种子将在火灾后发芽。
A serotinous plant will likely survive the next fire event. = 一种延迟的植物很可能在下次火灾中幸存下来。


虚拟语气:
If the cones were serotinous, the seeds would have survived the drought. = 如果球果是延迟的，种子就能度过干旱。
I wish the seeds were more serotinous; then we wouldn't have lost them. = 我希望种子更延迟；那样我们就不会失去它们了。


被动语态:
Many seeds were released after the serotinous cones were opened by the fire. = 许多种子在延迟的球果被火打开后被释放。
The serotinous seed dispersal strategy is being investigated by scientists. = 科学家正在研究延迟的种子传播策略。


疑问句:
Are those cones serotinous? = 那些球果是延迟的吗？
Is serotiny a common adaptation in this region? = 延迟性在这个地区是一种常见的适应性吗？


否定句:
The seeds were not serotinous; they were dispersed immediately. = 种子不是延迟的；它们立即被传播了。
This species does not exhibit serotinous behavior. = 这个物种没有表现出延迟的特性。


PHRASE->
serotinous cone = 延迟的球果
serotinous seed dispersal = 延迟的种子传播
serotinous reproduction = 延迟的繁殖
serotinous plant = 延迟的植物
fire-dependent serotiny = 依赖火的延迟性
