词源:
The word "nonexercisable" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "exercisable" (meaning "capable of being exercised").  "Exercisable" itself comes from the verb "exercise," ultimately deriving from Old French *exerciser and Latin *exercitationem ("practice, exercise").
