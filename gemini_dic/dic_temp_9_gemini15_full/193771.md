词源:
The word "self-deception" is a compound word. "Self" refers to oneself, and "deception" comes from the Old French word "deception," meaning "act of deceiving."  The prefix "de-" indicates removal or negation, and "ception" comes from the Latin "capere," meaning "to take" or "to seize," implying the act of being tricked or misled.  Therefore, self-deception literally means "the act of deceiving oneself."
