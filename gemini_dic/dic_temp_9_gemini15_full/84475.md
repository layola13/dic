The word "halser" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Perhaps "hawser," "halter," or another word entirely?  Please double-check the spelling.

2. **It's a proper noun or specialized term:** It might be a name, a technical term in a specific field (like nautical terminology), or a word from a dialect or jargon not widely used.  If you can provide context where you encountered this word, it would be helpful in determining its meaning.

3. **It's a newly coined word or a neologism:**  New words are occasionally created; however, without context, it's impossible to define it.
