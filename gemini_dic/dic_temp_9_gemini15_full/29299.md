词源:

The word "castaway" is a compound word.  "Cast" comes from Old English *cēast, meaning "throw" or "fling," related to the verb "to cast," which means to throw something. "Away" is also an Old English word, *aweg, meaning "off" or "aside."  Therefore, "castaway" literally means "thrown away" or "cast aside," reflecting its meaning of being abandoned or shipwrecked.
