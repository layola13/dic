词源:
The word "committed" originates from the verb "commit," which comes from the Old French word "commettre," meaning "to entrust, to commit."  The prefix "com-" means "together," and the root "-mittere" (from Latin) means "to send." Thus, the original meaning involved entrusting or assigning something to someone or something else.  Over time, the meaning evolved to include the sense of obligation and dedication.
