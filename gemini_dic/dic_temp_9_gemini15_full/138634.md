nucleotide:/ˈnuːkliəʊtaɪd/|/ˈnjuːkliəʊtaɪd/| n. |核苷酸|A nucleotide is the basic building block of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA).  It consists of a sugar molecule (ribose in RNA, deoxyribose in DNA), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base (adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, or uracil).|Example: DNA is a polymer made up of a long chain of nucleotides.|近义词:nucleoside|反义词:|
