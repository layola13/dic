词源:
源自玛利亚·玛德琳（Mary Magdalene），基督教中的一个人物，常被描绘成一个悔过自新的罪人，在艺术作品中常常以泪流满面的形象出现，因此与过度感伤联系起来。  The word is ultimately derived from the name Mary Magdalene, who in artistic representations is often depicted as weeping profusely.  This association with excessive weeping led to the development of the word's current meaning.
