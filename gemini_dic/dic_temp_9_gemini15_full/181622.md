词源:
The word "relaundered" is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the verb "laundered" (meaning to disguise the illegal origin of money).  The verb "launder" itself originates from the historical practice of cleaning dirty laundry, metaphorically extended to the process of cleaning or concealing the origins of illegally obtained money.
