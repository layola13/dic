词源:
The word "influence" comes from the Old French word "influence," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "influentia," meaning "an inflow," "influence," or "flowing in."  The Latin word is related to the verb "influere," meaning "to flow in."  The astrological concept of celestial bodies "flowing in" their influence on earthly events contributed to the word's development.
