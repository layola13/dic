词源: The word combines "mealy," referring to something soft and powdery like meal (ground grain), implying a lack of firmness or strength in speech, and "mouthed," referring to the way someone speaks.  The image is of someone whose words are soft and indistinct, like meal, lacking the directness of clear speech.
