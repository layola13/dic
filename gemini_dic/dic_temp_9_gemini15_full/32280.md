chiefdoms:/ˈtʃiːfdəm/| n. |酋邦；酋长统治地区 |A chiefdom is a form of sociopolitical organization intermediate between a tribe and a state.  It is characterized by the presence of a chief, a person who holds a formal position of authority and leadership within a community.  This authority is often hereditary, but it also relies on the chief's ability to maintain social order, resolve disputes, and mobilize resources. Chiefdoms are typically larger and more complex than tribes, exhibiting a degree of social stratification and centralized power. | Example: The Polynesian islands were often organized into chiefdoms, with powerful chiefs controlling vast territories and resources.  = 波利尼西亚群岛通常被组织成酋邦，强大的酋长控制着广阔的领土和资源。

The ancient Maya civilization was comprised of numerous independent chiefdoms. = 古玛雅文明由许多独立的酋邦组成。| 近义词：kingdom, principality, dominion | 反义词：tribe (in terms of societal complexity)
