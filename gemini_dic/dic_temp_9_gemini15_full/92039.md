hyperpersonal:/ˌhaɪpərˈpɜːrsənəl/ | adj. | 超个人的，超越个人的 |  Describes online relationships that are more intimate and intense than face-to-face relationships, often due to selective self-presentation and idealized perceptions.  This is because online communication allows individuals to carefully craft their online personas and edit out negative aspects.  | Example:  The hyperpersonal nature of online dating can lead to unrealistic expectations.  在线约会的超个人性质可能导致不切实际的期望。 | 近义词:  intense, intimate, idealized | 反义词: impersonal, detached, superficial
