lithophyll:/ˈlɪθəfɪl/| n. |岩石植物|A plant that grows on rocks, especially one that is adapted to such a habitat.  Lithophylls are often found in harsh environments where soil is scarce or absent. They have developed specialized adaptations to survive in these conditions, such as drought tolerance, efficient nutrient uptake from rock surfaces, and the ability to withstand strong winds and temperature fluctuations.|例句：Many lithophylls thrive in the crevices of cliffs and rock faces. 许多岩石植物在悬崖峭壁和岩石表面缝隙中茁壮成长。  The unique adaptations of lithophylls allow them to colonize otherwise inhospitable environments. 岩石植物独特的适应性使它们能够在原本不适宜生存的环境中定居。|近义词：rock plant, epilithic plant|反义词：soil plant (no direct antonym, but contrasting habitat)|名词
