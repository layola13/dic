词源：The word "self-deprecation" is composed of two parts: "self-" (meaning oneself) and "deprecation" (meaning the act of belittling or undervaluing).  "Deprecation" comes from the Latin word "deprecāre," meaning "to pray against," "to avert," or "to deprecate."  Over time, its meaning shifted to include the sense of belittling or expressing disapproval.
