The word "impolitenesses" derives from the adjective "impolite," which is formed by adding the negative prefix "im-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "polite."  "Polite" originates from the Old French word "polit," meaning "polished, refined," ultimately from the Latin word "politus," the past participle of "polio," meaning "to polish."  The suffix "-nesses" is added to form the plural noun, indicating multiple instances of impoliteness.
