lymphadenitis:/ˌlɪmfˌædəˈnaɪtɪs/ | n. |淋巴腺炎 |Inflammation of one or more lymph nodes.  Lymph nodes are small, bean-shaped glands that are part of the body's immune system.  They filter lymph, a fluid containing white blood cells that fight infection. When a lymph node becomes inflamed, it is often a sign of infection or another underlying medical condition. | Example: The doctor diagnosed her with lymphadenitis after examining the swollen lymph nodes in her neck.  医生检查了她颈部肿大的淋巴结后，诊断她患有淋巴腺炎。 |近义词：lymphangitis (if inflammation extends to lymph vessels), adenitis (more general inflammation of a gland) |反义词：None specifically, but the absence of inflammation could be described as "normal lymph node status".
