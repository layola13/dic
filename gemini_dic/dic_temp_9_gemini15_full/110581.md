limited-government: /ˈlɪmɪtɪd ˈɡʌvənmənt/ | adj. n. phr. | 有限政府；小政府 |  A system of government where governmental power is restricted by law, usually to protect individual liberty.  This contrasts with a system where the government has unlimited or arbitrary power. The specific limitations vary greatly depending on the country and its constitution or other governing documents.  |  The United States, with its checks and balances system, is often cited as an example of a limited government, although the extent of its limitations is frequently debated. The rise of the administrative state in the 20th century has led to increased concern about the expansion of governmental power beyond its constitutional limits. | 近义词：constitutional government, restrained government | 反义词：unlimited government, totalitarian government, authoritarian government

词源:

"Limited" derives from the Old French "limité,"  meaning "bounded" or "restricted."  It's ultimately from the Latin "limitare," meaning "to bound" or "to confine."

"Government" originates from the Old French "gouvernement,"  itself from the Latin "gubernāmentum," meaning "steering" or "management," related to "gubernāre," meaning "to steer" or "to govern."  The core concept involves the guidance and control of a group or society.
