词源:

* **deutero-**: From Greek *δεύτερος* (deuteros), meaning "second".
* **canonical**: From Greek *κανών* (kanon), meaning "rule," "standard," or "list."  In this context, referring to the officially accepted books of the Bible.

Therefore, "deuterocanonical" literally means "belonging to a second canon" or "a second list of officially accepted books".  It refers to the books considered sacred by some but not by others, hence their secondary status in certain traditions.
