词源:
The word "indurance" comes from the Old French word "endurance," which means "the act of enduring."  The prefix "in-" is a variant of the Old French "en-," which in this context doesn't negate but rather intensifies the meaning, similar to how "enlarge" intensifies "large."  Therefore, "indurance" emphasizes the strength and capacity for enduring.
