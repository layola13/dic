PHRASE->
(Due to its informal nature, "da" doesn't typically form common phrases in the same way as "what" or "that.")  There are no standard, widely accepted phrases using "da" as a central component beyond its basic usage as a pronoun.


Note: The usage of "da" is highly contextual and dependent on dialect.  It's not considered standard English and is generally avoided in formal writing or speaking.
