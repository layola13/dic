词源:

The word "ribaldry" ultimately derives from the Old French word "ribaude," meaning "a woman of loose morals," which itself may be related to  "ribauld," meaning "rascal,"  "rogue," or "vagabond." The connection is that such individuals were often associated with coarse and vulgar behavior and language.  Over time, the word shifted to focus on the language and behavior itself, rather than the person exhibiting it.
