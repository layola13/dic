词源:  The word "savvy" ultimately derives from the French word *savoir*, meaning "to know."  It evolved through various stages of English, initially as a noun meaning "knowledge" or "understanding," before settling into its current adjectival usage.


用法说明:

Savvy is primarily used as an adjective to describe someone who is intelligent, knowledgeable, and perceptive, especially in a practical or business context.  It implies a level of understanding beyond mere knowledge; it suggests the ability to apply that knowledge effectively.  It's often used informally.


There is no verb or noun form of "savvy" in standard English usage. While one might hear "to savvy" used informally, it's not considered standard.
