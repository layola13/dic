词源:
The word "morselization" is derived from the verb "morselize," which is a relatively modern coinage. It's likely a blend or back-formation from words related to "morsel," meaning a small piece of food.  The suffix "-ization" indicates the process of making something into smaller pieces.  There isn't a direct etymological root tracing back to classical languages like Greek or Latin. It's a relatively recent term, its usage becoming more prominent with advancements in medical technology.
