co-omnipotent: /ˌkoʊ ɒmˈnɪpətn̩t/ | adj. | 共有全能的；共同全能的 |  Combining the power of multiple omnipotent entities, suggesting a shared or collaborative omnipotence.  It's a relatively rare word, formed by combining "co-" (together, jointly) and "omnipotent" (all-powerful). It implies a situation where multiple all-powerful beings work together, pooling their abilities.  There is no direct opposite, as the antonym would depend on the context.  If referring to the individual entities losing their omnipotence, then "impotent" or "limited" might apply. If referring to the collaborative aspect, "disunited" or "uncooperative" could be considered.


例句：

The gods, though individually omnipotent, were co-omnipotent in their governance of the cosmos. = 众神虽然个体全能，但在宇宙统治中却是共同全能的。


In the proposed multiverse theory, each universe may have its own omnipotent creator, but together they form a co-omnipotent entity. = 在提出的多元宇宙理论中，每个宇宙可能都有自己全能的创造者，但它们共同构成一个共同全能的实体。
