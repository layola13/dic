The word "ingelable" is not a word found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure field.

To help you, I need more context. Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing its source might help determine its intended meaning and allow for a more accurate analysis.
