英文解析:
A skull is the bony structure that forms the head of most vertebrates.  It protects the brain and provides attachment points for muscles of the face and neck.  The term can also be used figuratively to refer to death or fate, especially in expressions like "meet one's skull" or "face the skull."

例句:

词源:
From Old English *scœl, *sċeall, from Proto-Germanic *skaljō, from Proto-Indo-European *(s)kǝl- “hard, shell”.  The word's evolution reflects its connection to the hard, protective nature of the skull bone.  The figurative usage related to death likely derives from the skull's association with mortality.
