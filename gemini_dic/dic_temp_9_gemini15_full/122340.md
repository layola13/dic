/ˈmɪkstnəsɪz/ | n. |混合性，多样性，混杂 |The word "mixedness's" is grammatically incorrect.  It incorrectly uses the possessive 's after a noun already suggesting plurality or a collective state.  The correct term would depend on the intended meaning and would likely be "mixedness" or a phrase describing the type of mixture.  For example, "the mixedness of the cultures" or "the qualities of its mixedness."  |例句：The mixedness of the city's population is evident in its diverse cuisine. (城市人口的混合性在其多元化的美食中显而易见。) The degree of mixedness in the paint was difficult to determine. (油漆的混合程度难以确定。) |近义词: heterogeneity, variety, diversity, blend |反义词: homogeneity, uniformity, singularity |名词
