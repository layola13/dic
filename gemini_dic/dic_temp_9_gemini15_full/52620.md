WORD ORIGIN->
The word "digestiveness" is derived from the verb "digest," ultimately from the Latin word "digerere," meaning "to distribute," "to arrange," or "to dissolve."  The suffix "-ive" denotes a quality or tendency, and the suffix "-ness" indicates a state or condition. Therefore, "digestiveness" signifies the state or quality of being easily digested or the capacity for digestion.
