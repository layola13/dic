词源:
The word "requires" comes from the Old French "requiert," which is the third-person singular present indicative form of the verb "requerre," meaning "to require, demand, ask."  "Requerre" itself has roots in the Latin verb "requirere," meaning "to seek, search for, demand."  The prefix "re-" indicates repetition or intensification, and the root "-quirere" is related to words like "inquire" and "acquire."
