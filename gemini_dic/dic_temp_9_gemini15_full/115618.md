The word "marcer" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Perhaps you could provide more context where you encountered this word.

2. **It's a neologism or a very rare word:**  Newly coined words or words used within a very specific field (like a technical jargon) might not be in common dictionaries.

3. **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word from another language that's not commonly used in English.

To help me provide the requested information, please clarify the source of the word "marcer" or provide a sentence where it appears.  I need more information to analyze it.
