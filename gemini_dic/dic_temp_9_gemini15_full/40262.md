词源:
The word "contingently" derives from the Latin word "contingens," which means "touching," "bordering," or "happening."  The "con-" prefix implies "together" or "with," while "-ingens" relates to the act or state of happening.  Over time, the meaning shifted to emphasize the dependence of one event on another, resulting in the modern sense of "depending on circumstances."
