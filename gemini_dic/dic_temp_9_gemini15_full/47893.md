decene: /ˈdɛsiːn/ | n. | 十碳烯 | A decene is any alkene with ten carbon atoms.  The general formula is C₁₀H₂₀.  There are many isomers of decene, differing in the position of the double bond and the arrangement of the carbon chain. | Example:  Several isomers of decene are used in the production of plastics.  几种十碳烯异构体用于塑料生产。 | 近义词:  (depending on the specific isomer)  other alkenes with ten carbons | 反义词:  N/A (no direct antonym, but alkanes could be considered chemically opposite)
