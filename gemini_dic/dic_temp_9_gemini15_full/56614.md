词源:  The term "done in" is a phrasal verb that evolved from the older meaning of "done" as "finished" or "completed," combined with the preposition "in."  The "in" suggests a state of being overwhelmed or thoroughly affected.  The evolution reflects a figurative extension of the initial meaning, moving from a literal completion to a state of exhaustion or defeat.  While a precise historical etymology is hard to pinpoint, its usage is clearly rooted in the descriptive power of this phrasing.  The meaning shifts from "finished" to "finished off" or "defeated" and finally to the state of being utterly exhausted.
