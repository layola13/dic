semicelluloses:/ˌsɛmiˈsɛljuˌloʊsiz/| n. |半纤维素|A group of complex carbohydrates that are similar to cellulose but have a less organized structure and are more easily broken down.  They are a major component of plant cell walls, providing structural support and contributing to the plant's overall rigidity. Semicelluloses are heterogeneous polymers consisting primarily of pentoses (five-carbon sugars) such as xylose and arabinose, and hexoses (six-carbon sugars) such as glucose, galactose and mannose.  They are often found associated with cellulose and lignin in plant cell walls. | Example: The enzymatic hydrolysis of hemicellulose and cellulose is crucial for biofuel production. 半纤维素和纤维素的酶解对于生物燃料的生产至关重要。|近义词：hemicellulose (often used interchangeably)|反义词：cellulose (in terms of structural organization and digestibility)|名词
