词源：

The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "imputable," which comes from the verb "impute" (meaning "to attribute or ascribe").  "Impute" originates from the Latin word "imputare," meaning "to charge, reckon, or ascribe." Therefore, "nonimputably" literally means "not capable of being attributed or charged."
