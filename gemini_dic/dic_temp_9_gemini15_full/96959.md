词源:

The word "infamous" originates from the Latin word "infamis," which is a combination of the prefix "in-" (meaning "not" or "without") and "fāma" (meaning "fame" or "reputation").  Therefore, "infamis" literally means "without fame" or "having a bad reputation."  Over time, the meaning shifted to emphasize the negative aspect of the reputation, resulting in the modern English "infamous," which specifically denotes a negative or wicked reputation.
