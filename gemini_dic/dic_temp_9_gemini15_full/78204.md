geotropism:/ˌdʒioʊˈtrɒpɪzəm/| n. |向地性；向重力性 |The directional growth response of a plant to gravity.  Geotropism is a type of tropism, which is a directional growth response of a plant to an external stimulus.  Positive geotropism refers to growth towards the earth (e.g., roots), while negative geotropism refers to growth away from the earth (e.g., stems).|Example: The roots of the plant exhibited positive geotropism, growing downwards towards the earth.|近义词：gravitropism|反义词：apogeotropism


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The roots show positive geotropism. = 根表现出正向地性。
Plants exhibit various tropisms. = 植物表现出各种向性。


一般过去时:
The stem demonstrated negative geotropism. = 茎表现出负向地性。
The experiment showed clear geotropic response. = 实验显示了明显的向地性反应。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied geotropism for centuries. = 科学家们已经研究向地性几个世纪了。
Researchers have observed different geotropic responses in various species. = 研究人员在不同的物种中观察到不同的向地性反应。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, we had hypothesized a strong geotropic effect. = 在实验之前，我们假设存在强大的向地性效应。
They had already known about the plant's geotropic behavior. = 他们已经知道这种植物的向地性行为。


将来时:
We will investigate the mechanism of geotropism. = 我们将研究向地性的机制。
The study will reveal more details about geotropism in this plant. = 这项研究将揭示更多关于这种植物向地性的细节。


虚拟语气:
If the plant lacked auxin, it would not exhibit geotropism. = 如果植物缺乏生长素，它就不会表现出向地性。
It would be interesting if we could manipulate geotropism. = 如果我们能够操纵向地性，那将很有趣。


被动语态:
Geotropism is influenced by gravity. = 向地性受重力影响。
The experiment was designed to study geotropism. = 实验旨在研究向地性。


疑问句:
Does this plant show positive or negative geotropism? = 这种植物表现出正向地性还是负向地性？
How is geotropism affected by light? = 光线如何影响向地性？


否定句:
The plant did not exhibit a strong geotropic response. = 这种植物没有表现出强烈的向地性反应。
This species does not show typical geotropism. = 这个物种没有表现出典型的向地性。


PHRASE->
positive geotropism = 正向地性
negative geotropism = 负向地性
gravitropism (synonym) = 向重力性
geotropic response = 向地性反应
mechanism of geotropism = 向地性机制
