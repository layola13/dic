词源:  The word "picketed" comes from the noun "picket," which originally referred to a pointed stake used to build a fence or fortification.  Later, it came to refer to a guard or sentry.  The use of pickets in a line to block access to a place evolved into the modern sense of protest picketing. The suffix "-ed" denotes the past tense or past participle form of the verb.
