词源:  The word "hysterics" ultimately derives from the Greek word "hystera," meaning "womb."  In ancient medical understanding, many female emotional disturbances were attributed to problems with the womb. This etymology reflects outdated and sexist medical beliefs.  Over time, the term's meaning broadened to encompass uncontrolled emotional displays in both men and women.
