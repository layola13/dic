词源:
The word "reformative" is derived from the verb "reform," which comes from the Old French word "reformer,"  meaning "to form again, reshape."  The prefix "re-" indicates repetition or reversal, and "-ative" is a suffix forming adjectives meaning "having the nature of" or "tending to."  Therefore, "reformative" literally means "tending to reshape or improve."
