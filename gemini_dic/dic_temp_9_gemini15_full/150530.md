词源:
The word "pantsuited" is a relatively recent addition to the English lexicon, formed by combining "pantsuit" (a woman's suit consisting of pants and a jacket) with the "-ed" suffix, which typically indicates being dressed in something.  The word reflects a growing acceptance and prevalence of pantsuits as professional attire for women.
