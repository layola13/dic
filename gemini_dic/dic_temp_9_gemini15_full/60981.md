It can refer to a substance or event that triggers a specific reaction or process. | Example: The introduction of a new pathogen acted as an elicitor, triggering the plant's immune system.  引入新的病原体起到了诱因的作用，触发了植物的免疫系统。 |近义词：stimulus, trigger, instigator | 反义词：inhibitor, suppressor |  词性：名词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The elicitor triggers an immune response. = 诱因触发免疫反应。
This chemical acts as an elicitor in the plant. =  这种化学物质在植物中充当诱因。


一般过去时:

现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered several new elicitors. = 科学家们已经发现了几个新的诱因。
The experiment has shown that this substance is a potent elicitor. = 实验表明，这种物质是一种有效的诱因。


过去完成时:
They had already identified the elicitor before the experiment began. = 实验开始前他们就已经确定了诱因。
The plant had already responded to the elicitor by the time we observed it. = 当我们观察到它时，植物已经对诱因做出了反应。


将来时:
Researchers will investigate the effects of this new elicitor. = 研究人员将研究这种新型诱因的影响。
We will use this elicitor to study the immune system. = 我们将用这种诱因来研究免疫系统。


虚拟语气:
If we had a more potent elicitor, the results would be better. = 如果我们有更有效的诱因，结果会更好。
I wish we knew the exact nature of the elicitor. = 我希望我们知道诱因的确切性质。


被动语态:
