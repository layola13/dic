semivowels:/ˈsemiˌvaʊəl/| n.|半元音|A semivowel is a sound that is phonetically similar to a vowel but functions as a consonant.  They are also known as approximants. Semivowels are produced with less constriction of the vocal tract than consonants, but more constriction than vowels.  They often act as transitions between vowels and other consonants within a syllable.|Example: The sounds /w/, /j/, and sometimes /r/ and /l/ are considered semivowels in English.  The "w" in "wet" and the "y" in "yes" are semivowels.|近义词：approximant|反义词：vowel, consonant
