interfibrous: /ˌɪntərˈfaɪbrəs/ | adj. |纤维间的，纤维之间的| Relating to or situated between fibers.  The term describes something located or occurring in the spaces between individual fibers within a fibrous structure, such as tissue or a material. |例句：The interfibrous spaces in the connective tissue are filled with ground substance. 结缔组织中的纤维间隙充满了基质。


The interfibrous matrix plays a crucial role in tissue strength and elasticity. 纤维间基质在组织强度和弹性中起着至关重要的作用。|近义词：interfascicular, intercellular (in some contexts)|反义词：intrafibrous|词性：形容词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in scientific and technical contexts, particularly in fields like histology (the study of tissues), materials science, and engineering.  Therefore, tense conjugation examples are less relevant than providing context for its usage.


Example Sentences in Scientific/Technical Contexts:

1.  "The study investigated the distribution of collagen fibers and the properties of the interfibrous matrix in the tendon." 这项研究调查了肌腱中胶原纤维的分布和纤维间基质的特性。

2.  "Interfibrous bonding strength is a critical factor determining the overall mechanical performance of the composite material." 纤维间结合强度是决定复合材料整体机械性能的关键因素。

3. "The researchers observed increased interfibrous spaces after applying the experimental treatment." 研究人员在应用实验治疗后观察到纤维间隙增加。

4. "Microscopic analysis revealed significant changes in the interfibrous structure following the injury." 显微分析显示损伤后纤维间结构发生了显著变化。

5.  "The novel material exhibited improved interfibrous adhesion, enhancing its overall durability."  这种新型材料表现出改进的纤维间粘合性，增强了其整体耐用性。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "interfibrous". The word itself is used to describe a specific anatomical or material property.  Phrases would need to be built around the concept, for example:  "increased interfibrous spacing", "interfibrous connectivity", "interfibrous interaction", "interfibrous matrix composition", "interfibrous bonding".


WORD ORIGIN->

* **inter-**:  A prefix meaning "between" or "among".  Derived from Latin.
* **fibrous**:  Relating to or consisting of fibers.  Derived from "fiber," ultimately from Old French "fibre," from Latin "fibra."


Therefore, "interfibrous" literally means "between fibers".
