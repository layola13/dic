USAGE->
一般现在时:
Amoebas use pseudopods for locomotion. = 变形虫利用伪足进行运动。
The cell extends a pseudopod to engulf the bacterium. = 细胞伸出伪足吞噬细菌。


一般过去时:
The amoeba formed a pseudopod to capture its food. = 变形虫形成了一个伪足来捕获食物。
The cell extended a pseudopod and surrounded the particle. = 细胞伸出一个伪足并包围了颗粒。


现在完成时:
The amoeba has used pseudopods to move across the slide. = 变形虫已经用伪足在载玻片上移动。
The cell has engulfed the food particle with its pseudopod. = 细胞已经用它的伪足吞噬了食物颗粒。


过去完成时:
The amoeba had already formed a pseudopod before I observed it. = 我观察到变形虫之前，它已经形成了伪足。
The cell had extended its pseudopod and retracted it quickly. = 细胞已经伸出了它的伪足并迅速缩回。


将来时:
The amoeba will form a pseudopod to move towards the light. = 变形虫将形成伪足向光移动。
The cell will extend a pseudopod to capture the passing prey. = 细胞将伸出伪足捕获经过的猎物。


虚拟语气:
If the amoeba had more energy, it would form a larger pseudopod. = 如果变形虫有更多能量，它会形成更大的伪足。
If the cell could, it would extend a pseudopod to explore its surroundings. = 如果细胞可以，它会伸出伪足来探索周围环境。


被动语态:
The bacterium was engulfed by a pseudopod. = 细菌被伪足吞噬。
The food particle was surrounded and absorbed by the extending pseudopod. = 食物颗粒被伸出的伪足包围并吸收。


疑问句:
How does the amoeba use its pseudopods? = 变形虫如何使用它的伪足？
Does the cell form multiple pseudopods simultaneously? = 细胞是否同时形成多个伪足？


否定句:
The amoeba did not form a pseudopod. = 变形虫没有形成伪足。
The cell did not extend a pseudopod to capture the particle. = 细胞没有伸出伪足来捕获颗粒。



PHRASE->
formation of pseudopods  伪足的形成
extension of pseudopods  伪足的延伸
retraction of pseudopods  伪足的回缩
amoeboid movement (using pseudopods)  变形虫运动（使用伪足）
