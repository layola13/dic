词源:
The word "pessary" comes from the Late Latin word *pessarium*, which in turn is derived from the Latin word *pes* meaning "foot."  The original meaning referred to a stone or other object used to support the foot, later extended metaphorically to a device used to support the uterus.  The modern medical usage evolved from this, referring to the objects inserted into the vagina.
