legumin:/ˈlɛɡjʊmɪn/| n. |豆浆蛋白，球蛋白|A protein found in pulses (legumes) such as peas, beans, and lentils. It is a type of globulin.  Legumin is a storage protein, meaning it is a major source of nitrogen for the developing seedling.  It's also a significant source of protein in human diets.|The legumin content of soybeans varies depending on the cultivar and growing conditions.|近义词：globulin, seed protein|反义词：无
