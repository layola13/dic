词源:

The word is a compound of "self" (meaning "oneself") and "dissecting" (from the verb "dissect," meaning "to cut apart and examine in detail").  The "self" prefix indicates that the action of dissecting is being performed by the subject itself.  Therefore, the overall meaning points to a process of internal analysis and critique.
