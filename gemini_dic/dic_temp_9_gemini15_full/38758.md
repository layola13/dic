词源:
The word "condone" comes from the Old French word "condoner," which means "to forgive."  This in turn derives from the Latin word "condonare," a compound of "con-" (together, completely) and "donare" (to give).  The original sense implied giving something up, like forgiving a debt or offense, which evolved into the modern meaning of overlooking or tolerating something wrong.
