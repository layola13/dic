lightmaps:/ˈlaɪtˌmæps/| n.|光照贴图|A lightmap is a texture that stores pre-calculated lighting information for a scene or object in a 3D computer graphics application.  It's used to improve rendering performance by avoiding real-time lighting calculations for every pixel.  Instead, the lightmap provides a static representation of how light affects the surface. |Example:  The game developers used high-resolution lightmaps to achieve realistic lighting in the final product.  游戏开发者使用了高分辨率光照贴图来实现最终产品中的逼真光照。|近义词：light baking, illumination map|反义词：real-time lighting


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The game uses lightmaps to improve performance. = 游戏使用光照贴图来提高性能。
Lightmaps store pre-calculated lighting data. = 光照贴图存储预先计算的光照数据。


一般过去时:
The artist baked lightmaps for the entire level. = 艺术家为整个关卡烘焙了光照贴图。
They used lightmaps in the previous game engine. = 他们在之前的游戏引擎中使用了光照贴图。


现在完成时:
We have implemented lightmaps in our rendering pipeline. = 我们已经在我们的渲染管线中实现了光照贴图。
They have already generated the lightmaps for the scene. = 他们已经为场景生成了光照贴图。


过去完成时:
Before rendering, the engine had already processed the lightmaps. = 在渲染之前，引擎已经处理了光照贴图。
The team had completed the lightmap baking process before the deadline. = 团队在截止日期前完成了光照贴图烘焙过程。


将来时:
We will use lightmaps in our next project. = 我们将在下一个项目中使用光照贴图。
They will generate the lightmaps automatically. = 他们将自动生成光照贴图。


虚拟语气:
If we had better lightmaps, the game would look more realistic. = 如果我们有更好的光照贴图，游戏看起来会更逼真。
I wish we had used higher-resolution lightmaps. = 我希望我们使用了更高分辨率的光照贴图。


被动语态:
Lightmaps are generated by a specialized software. = 光照贴图是由专门的软件生成的。
The lightmaps were baked overnight. = 光照贴图在一夜之间烘焙完成。


疑问句:
Are lightmaps necessary for this project? = 这个项目需要光照贴图吗？
Have the lightmaps been optimized for performance? = 光照贴图是否针对性能进行了优化？


否定句:
The game doesn't use lightmaps. = 游戏不使用光照贴图。
This engine doesn't support dynamic lightmaps. = 此引擎不支持动态光照贴图。


PHRASE->
generate lightmaps = 生成光照贴图
bake lightmaps = 烘焙光照贴图
high-resolution lightmaps = 高分辨率光照贴图
real-time lightmaps = 实时光照贴图 (though less common due to the nature of lightmaps)
optimize lightmaps = 优化光照贴图
