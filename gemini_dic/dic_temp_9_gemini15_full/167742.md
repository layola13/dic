词源:  The word derives from "prig," a term dating back to the 17th century.  The original meaning of "prig" was a conceited or affected person, often implying someone who was overly fussy about their appearance or manners. The suffix "-ism"  was added to create the noun "priggism," denoting the characteristic behavior or doctrine of a prig.  The exact etymology of "prig" itself is uncertain, but some theories link it to words suggesting stealing or picking, perhaps implying a sense of petty theft of attention or admiration.
