词源:
The word "culler" ultimately derives from the Old French word *coler*, meaning "to strain, to sift, to gather". This in turn has roots in the Latin word *colare*, with the same meaning.  The transition from straining liquids to selecting items likely reflects a metaphorical extension of the meaning.
