look-and-say:/ˈlʊk ænd seɪ/| n. adj. | 看说；视读 |  A method of describing a sequence, typically of numbers or symbols, by reading it aloud and stating what is seen.  This is often used in the context of generating sequences.  For example, the sequence "1, 11, 21, 1211, 111221..." is generated by the look-and-say sequence. | The look-and-say sequence starts with "1", then each subsequent term is derived by describing the previous term. "1" is described as "one 1" (11), "11" is described as "two 1s" (21), and so on. | 近义词：describe-and-generate,  iterative sequence generation | 反义词：None

一般过去时:
They looked and said the sequence correctly. = 他们正确地读出了序列。

现在完成时:
We have looked and said many sequences today. = 我们今天已经读出了许多序列。
She has looked and said the pattern and found the solution. = 她已经观察并说出模式并找到了解决方案。


过去完成时:
They had looked and said the pattern before making the prediction. = 他们在做出预测之前已经观察并说出了模式。
I had looked and said the previous sequences to find the rule. = 我已经观察并说出了之前的序列来找到规则。


将来时:
We will look and say the sequence during the presentation. = 我们将在演示期间读出序列。
They will look and say the pattern to solve the puzzle. = 他们将观察并说出模式来解决难题。


虚拟语气:
If I looked and said carefully, I would not make a mistake. = 如果我仔细观察并说出，我不会犯错。
I wish I had looked and said the instructions more clearly. = 我希望我更清楚地观察并说出说明。

The pattern will be looked and said again for clarity. = 为了清晰起见，模式将再次被观察并说出。


疑问句:
Will you look and say the sequence with me? = 你会和我一起读出序列吗？
How do you look and say this complex pattern? = 你如何观察并说出这个复杂的模式？


否定句:
They did not look and say the sequence accurately. = 他们没有准确地读出序列。
I do not look and say patterns easily. = 我不容易观察并说出模式。
