He is considered one of the founders of Sophism, a school of thought that emphasized rhetoric and practical wisdom over abstract philosophical inquiry. His most famous claim is "Man is the measure of all things," suggesting that truth is relative and subjective, dependent on individual perception and perspective.  He is known for his contributions to logic, ethics, and political theory, and his teachings influenced many subsequent thinkers.|Protagoras famously argued, "Man is the measure of all things, of things that are that they are, and of things that are not that they are not."|近义词：Sophist, rhetorician|反义词：N/A
