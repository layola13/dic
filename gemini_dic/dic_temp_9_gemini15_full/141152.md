The word "ooelogical" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or any recognized lexicon.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis following the requested format.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a fictional language.
