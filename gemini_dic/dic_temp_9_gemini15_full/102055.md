isomers:/ˈaɪsəmərz/| n. |异构体|Molecules that have the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms are called isomers.  Isomers often have very different chemical and physical properties despite their identical molecular formulas.|  For example, glucose and fructose are isomers, both with the formula C6H12O6 but with different structures and properties.|近义词：isomorph (in some contexts)|反义词：None (antonyms don't directly apply as it describes a structural relationship)|名词
