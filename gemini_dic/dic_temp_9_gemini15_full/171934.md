The word "puplican" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries such as Merriam-Webster, Oxford English Dictionary, or Cambridge Dictionary.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a regional dialect word, or a proper noun (like a name) not widely known.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis using the requested format.
