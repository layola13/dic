Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is not possible.  It seems to be a playful or invented combination of "getter" and "up," suggesting someone who gets up early or is diligent.


To illustrate how such a word *might* be analyzed if it were established, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where it were a verb:
