The word "cive" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  It's likely a misspelling or a word from a very specialized or obsolete lexicon.
