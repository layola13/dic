WORD ORIGIN->
The word "inflammableness" is derived from the verb "inflame" and the suffix "-ableness."

* **inflame:**  This comes from the Old French "enflamer," ultimately from the Latin "inflammare," meaning "to set on fire."  It combines the prefix "in-" (in, into) with "flamma" (flame).

* **-ableness:** This suffix is a common English suffix that turns a verb or adjective into a noun denoting capacity, capability, or tendency.

Therefore, "inflammableness" literally means "the state or quality of being able to be inflamed" or "the capacity to catch fire easily."
