词源:
The word "fishtail" is a compound word, combining "fish" and "tail".  The use of "fishtail" to describe a car's skidding movement likely arose from the visual similarity between the sideways motion of the car's rear and the movement of a fish's tail.  The use to describe a dress comes from the similar shape.
