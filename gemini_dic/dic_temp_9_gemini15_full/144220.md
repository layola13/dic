词源:

outskirmishing is derived from the noun "skirmish" + "-ing".  "Skirmish" itself comes from the Old French word "eskirmisser," meaning "to skirmish," which in turn is of uncertain origin, possibly related to a Germanic root.  The prefix "out-" intensifies the meaning, suggesting a more widespread or extensive series of skirmishes.
