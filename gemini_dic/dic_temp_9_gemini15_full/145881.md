overdesirousnesses:/ˌoʊvərˈdɪzaɪrəsnɪsəz/ | n. |过度渴望；过分热切 |The word "overdesirousnesses" is not a commonly used word in standard English.  It's a rather artificial formation, created by adding the suffix "-nesses" to "overdesirous," which itself is not frequently used.  It implies an excessive or overwhelming number of instances of excessive desire. The word highlights the multiplicity and intensity of unwarranted yearning. |Example:  His overdesirousnesses regarding wealth led him down a path of questionable ethics.  他的过度渴望财富，使他走上了一条道德败坏的道路。|近义词: excessive desires, extreme longings, insatiable wants |反义词: apathy, indifference, unconcern |名词


USAGE->
This word is so uncommon that providing grammatical examples across various tenses is impractical and potentially misleading.  Its usage would be highly contextual and likely found only in very specific, perhaps literary, contexts.  The grammatical structure would follow standard noun usage.


PHRASE->
Because "overdesirousnesses" is not a standard word, providing common phrases is inappropriate.  The word itself is the phrase.
