kepler:/ˈkɛplər/| n.|开普勒|Johannes Kepler (1571-1630), a German astronomer who formulated three laws summarizing planetary motion.  His laws described the elliptical orbits of planets around the sun, and revolutionized the understanding of our solar system.  The word can also refer to things named after him, such as the Kepler space telescope.| Example: Kepler's laws of planetary motion are fundamental to astronomy.  开普勒的行星运动定律是天文学的基础。|近义词：astronomer (if referring to the person), celestial mechanic|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Kepler's laws explain planetary orbits. = 开普勒定律解释了行星的轨道。
The Kepler telescope continues to discover exoplanets. = 开普勒望远镜仍在继续发现系外行星。


一般过去时:
Kepler formulated his three laws of planetary motion. = 开普勒制定了他的三个行星运动定律。
Scientists used Kepler's data to refine their models. = 科学家们利用开普勒的数据来改进他们的模型。


现在完成时:
Scientists have confirmed Kepler's laws through numerous observations. = 科学家们通过无数的观测证实了开普勒定律。
The Kepler mission has discovered thousands of exoplanets. = 开普勒任务已经发现了数千颗系外行星。


过去完成时:
Before Kepler, the understanding of planetary motion was incomplete. = 在开普勒之前，对行星运动的理解是不完整的。
Astronomers had struggled for centuries to explain planetary orbits accurately before Kepler's work. = 在开普勒的工作之前，天文学家们几个世纪以来都在努力准确地解释行星轨道。


将来时:
Future missions will build upon Kepler's legacy. = 未来的任务将建立在开普勒的遗产之上。
Scientists will continue to analyze data from the Kepler telescope for years to come. = 科学家们将在未来几年继续分析开普勒望远镜的数据。


虚拟语气:
If Kepler hadn't made his discoveries, our understanding of the universe would be vastly different. = 如果开普勒没有做出他的发现，我们对宇宙的理解将会大相径庭。
I wish I could have witnessed Kepler's groundbreaking work firsthand. = 我真希望能够亲眼目睹开普勒开创性的工作。


被动语态:
Kepler's laws are still taught in astronomy classes today. = 开普勒定律至今仍在天文课上教授。
The Kepler telescope's data is being analyzed by researchers worldwide. = 开普勒望远镜的数据正在被世界各地的研究人员分析。


疑问句:
What are Kepler's three laws of planetary motion? = 开普勒的三个行星运动定律是什么？
How did Kepler's work change our understanding of the solar system? = 开普勒的工作如何改变了我们对太阳系的理解？


否定句:
Kepler's model didn't initially account for all observed planetary movements. = 开普勒的模型最初并没有解释所有观察到的行星运动。
His contemporaries did not immediately accept all of Kepler's findings. = 他的同时代人并没有立即接受开普勒的所有发现。


PHRASE->
Kepler's laws = 开普勒定律
Kepler telescope = 开普勒望远镜
Kepler mission = 开普勒任务
Keplerian motion = 开普勒运动
