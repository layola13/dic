The word "emrods" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word, like "hemorrhoids"?  If so, please clarify.

2. **It's a neologism or archaic term:**  It could be a newly coined word, a word from a very old dialect, or a word specific to a particular field.  More context is needed.

3. **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name or place name.  Again, context would be helpful.

4. **It's a typo:** A simple typographical error.
