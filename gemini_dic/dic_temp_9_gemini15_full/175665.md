词源:

The word "rantipole" is of uncertain origin, but it's believed to be a combination of "rant" (meaning to rave or speak wildly) and "pole" (possibly referring to a pole used in games or a "headstrong" person).  The exact etymological path is debated, but the overall sense of wild, unruly energy is consistent with its usage.  Its first recorded use was in the 17th century.
