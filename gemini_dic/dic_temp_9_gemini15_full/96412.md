词源:
The word "indisposition" comes from the Old French word "indisposicion," which is a combination of the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and "disposition" (meaning "arrangement, order, state"). The word originally referred to a lack of order or proper arrangement, but it eventually developed its modern meaning of a slight illness or feeling of unwellness.
