词源:
The word "chimera" comes from the Greek word "χίμαιρα" (khímaira), referring to a fire-breathing monster in Greek mythology, described as having the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a serpent.  The mythological creature's composite nature gave rise to the word's metaphorical use for something unreal or composed of incongruous elements.
