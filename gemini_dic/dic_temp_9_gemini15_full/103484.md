词源:
The word "jobsworth" is a blend of "job" and "worth," implying someone whose only worth is their job and its associated rules.  It is a relatively recent addition to the English language, arising in British English in the mid-20th century, likely as a pejorative term. The exact origin is difficult to pinpoint, but its use reflects a growing frustration with bureaucracy and inflexible adherence to rules.
