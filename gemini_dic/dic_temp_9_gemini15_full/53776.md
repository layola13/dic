词源:
The word "discommode" comes from the Old French word "descommoder," meaning "to disarrange, disorder."  The prefix "dis-" indicates negation or reversal, while the root "-commode" relates to the idea of convenience or order.  It ultimately shares roots with words like "commodious" (spacious, roomy) and "commodity" (useful product).
