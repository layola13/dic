polygenetic:/ˌpɒliˈdʒɛnɪk/| adj. |多基因的，多基因遗传的 | Relating to or determined by multiple genes.  Polygenetic traits are influenced by more than one gene, resulting in a wide range of phenotypic variations.  This contrasts with monogenic traits, which are controlled by a single gene. | Example:  Height is a polygenetic trait, influenced by many genes and environmental factors. 身高是一个多基因性状，受许多基因和环境因素的影响。  Many complex diseases are believed to be polygenetic in origin. 许多复杂的疾病被认为起源于多基因。|近义词：multifactorial, pleiotropic |反义词：monogenic


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The trait is polygenetic. = 这个性状是多基因的。
Many diseases are polygenetic. = 许多疾病是多基因的。


一般过去时:
Scientists discovered the trait was polygenetic. = 科学家发现该性状是多基因的。
Researchers determined the disease was polygenetic in nature. = 研究人员确定该疾病本质上是多基因的。


现在完成时:
Studies have shown that the condition is polygenetic. = 研究表明这种情况是多基因的。
Researchers have confirmed that the trait is polygenetic. = 研究人员证实该性状是多基因的。


过去完成时:
They had already suspected that the disease was polygenetic. = 他们之前已经怀疑该疾病是多基因的。
Scientists had previously identified several genes contributing to the polygenetic trait. = 科学家先前已鉴定出多个促成多基因性状的基因。


将来时:
Future research will likely reveal more polygenetic traits. = 未来的研究可能会揭示更多多基因性状。
We will investigate whether the disorder is polygenetic. = 我们将调查该疾病是否为多基因性。


虚拟语气:
If the trait were monogenic, the inheritance pattern would be simpler. = 如果该性状是单基因的，则遗传模式将更简单。
It is hypothesized that if more genes were involved, the trait would be more polygenetic. = 假设如果涉及更多基因，则该性状将更具多基因性。


被动语态:
The polygenetic nature of the disease was confirmed by several studies. = 多项研究证实了该疾病的多基因性质。
Many polygenetic traits are influenced by environmental factors. = 许多多基因性状受环境因素影响。


疑问句:
Is this trait polygenetic or monogenic? = 这种性状是多基因的还是单基因的？
Are complex diseases always polygenetic? = 复杂的疾病总是多基因的吗？


否定句:
The trait is not monogenic; it is polygenetic. = 该性状不是单基因的；它是多基因的。
The disease is not simply polygenetic; it also involves epigenetic factors. = 该疾病不仅仅是多基因的；它还涉及表观遗传因素。
