词源:
The word "lounge" comes from the Old French word "longe," meaning "long," which in turn came from the Latin word "longus." The sense of "to loiter" developed over time, reflecting the leisurely and extended nature of the act of resting.  The noun meaning "a place for relaxation" evolved from the verb's meaning.
