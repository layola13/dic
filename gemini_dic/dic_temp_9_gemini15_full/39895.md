The word "constitutionalist" is derived from "constitutional," which comes from the Latin word "constitution," meaning "establishment," "arrangement," or "structure."  Adding the suffix "-ist" signifies a person who believes in or adheres to something. Therefore, a constitutionalist is someone who believes in and supports the principles of a constitution.
