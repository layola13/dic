词源:

The word "carking" is believed to be an intensifying adjective derived from the now-obsolete verb "cark," meaning "to worry," "to grieve," or "to cause anxiety."  The exact etymological path is uncertain, but its usage suggests a connection to Middle English words related to anxiety and distress.  Its modern usage has shifted from simply expressing worry to conveying a stronger sense of irritation and annoyance.


用法说明:

"Carking" is primarily used informally as an intensifying adjective. It is not used in formal writing or speech.  It expresses a high degree of annoyance, frustration, or displeasure.  It's often used to emphasize the negative quality of something, similar to using words like "bloody," "damn," or "cursed" (though less strong than those expletives).  It's largely confined to British English.
