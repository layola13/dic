self-imitation:/ˌsɛlfˌɪmɪˈteɪʃən/| n. |自我模仿；自我效仿|The process of an agent learning by imitating its own past successful behaviors.  This is a core concept in reinforcement learning, where an agent can improve its performance by repeatedly practicing successful actions and strategies. It's often more efficient than learning from external demonstrations because the agent already possesses the relevant knowledge.  |Example: Self-imitation learning has shown promising results in robotics, enabling robots to learn complex tasks through trial and error and by leveraging their own past successes.|近义词：self-training, bootstrapping|反义词：N/A|名词
