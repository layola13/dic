The word "forkerve" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or technical field not widely known.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need clarification:

* **Is this a misspelling?** If so, please provide the intended word.
* **Is this a neologism?** If so, please provide context (where did you encounter this word?).  This will help determine its potential meaning and usage.
* **Is this a technical term?** If so, please specify the field (e.g., computing, engineering, etc.).


Without more information, I cannot fulfill your request.
