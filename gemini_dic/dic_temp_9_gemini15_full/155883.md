photoactivity: /ˌfoʊtoʊækˈtɪvɪti/ | n. | 光活性，感光性 | The ability of a substance to undergo a chemical change when exposed to light.  This often involves the absorption of light energy, leading to various reactions such as photocatalysis, photodegradation, or photosensitization. | Example:  The photoactivity of titanium dioxide makes it a useful material in self-cleaning surfaces.  二氧化钛的光活性使其成为自清洁表面的有用材料。|近义词：photosensitivity, light sensitivity | 反义词：photoinactivity
