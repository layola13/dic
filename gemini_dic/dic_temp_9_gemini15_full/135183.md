USAGE->
一般现在时:
The moon is nonorbiting. = 月亮没有绕轨道运行。(This is incorrect usage, as the moon orbits the Earth.  The example demonstrates the word but illustrates its misuse in a common context.)
This satellite is currently nonorbiting. = 这颗卫星目前没有绕轨道运行。


一般过去时:
The spacecraft was nonorbiting after its engine failed. =  航天器发动机故障后没有绕轨道运行。
The satellite became nonorbiting due to a malfunction. = 由于故障，卫星停止了绕轨道运行。


现在完成时:
The debris has been nonorbiting for several years. = 这碎片已经几年没有绕轨道运行了。
The satellite has remained nonorbiting since its launch failure. = 自发射失败以来，卫星一直没有绕轨道运行。


过去完成时:
The space station had been nonorbiting for hours before rescue arrived. =  救援到达之前，空间站已经没有绕轨道运行数小时了。(This is a less common scenario and would need a context of a catastrophic failure.)
The probe had become nonorbiting before we could send a correction signal. = 在我们能够发送校正信号之前，探测器就已经停止绕轨道运行了。


将来时:
The damaged satellite will be nonorbiting within a week. = 受损卫星将在一个星期内停止绕轨道运行。
The spacecraft will likely be nonorbiting after the deorbit burn. = 在减速制动后，航天器很可能将停止绕轨道运行。


虚拟语气:
If the engine had not failed, the spacecraft would not be nonorbiting. = 如果发动机没有故障，航天器就不会停止绕轨道运行。
I wish the satellite were not nonorbiting; we've lost valuable data. = 我希望卫星没有停止绕轨道运行；我们已经丢失了宝贵的数据。


被动语态:
The satellite was rendered nonorbiting by a solar flare. = 卫星由于太阳耀斑而停止绕轨道运行。
The spacecraft is expected to be declared nonorbiting after this maneuver. = 预计在这次机动之后，航天器将被宣布停止绕轨道运行。


疑问句:
Is the satellite nonorbiting? = 卫星没有绕轨道运行吗？
Will the asteroid remain nonorbiting after the collision? = 这次碰撞后小行星还会不会继续不绕轨道运行？


否定句:
The planet is not nonorbiting; it orbits the sun. = 行星不是不绕轨道运行的；它绕太阳运行。
The moon is not nonorbiting; it orbits the Earth. = 月亮不是不绕轨道运行的；它绕地球运行。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "nonorbiting" due to its specific scientific context.  The word itself is used primarily in technical descriptions.
