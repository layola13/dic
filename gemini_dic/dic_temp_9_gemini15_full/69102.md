The word "fauxer" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a particular dialect or context.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need clarification:

1. **Is this a misspelling?**  If so, please provide the intended word.

2. **Is this a newly coined word?** If so, please provide the context in which you encountered it, as this will help determine its meaning and potential usage.

3. **Is this a word from a specific dialect or field?**  If so, please specify the dialect or field.


Without this information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.
