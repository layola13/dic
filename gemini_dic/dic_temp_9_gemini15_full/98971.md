The word "inter-libeled" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, possibly formed by combining elements from existing words to create a new meaning.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  However, we can analyze its potential meaning based on its components:

* **inter-**: This prefix typically indicates "between," "among," "reciprocally," or "mutually."
* **libeled**: This is the past participle of "libel," which means to publish a false statement that damages someone's reputation.

Therefore, "inter-libeled" could hypothetically mean something like "mutually libeled each other," or "libeled each other in a reciprocal manner."  However, this is purely speculative.  The word lacks established usage and meaning.  To provide a detailed analysis as requested would be inventing information.
