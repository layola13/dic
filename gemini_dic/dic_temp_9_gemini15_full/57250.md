downlinks:/ˈdaʊnˌlɪŋks/ | n. |下行链路，下行数据链路 | A downlink is a communication link from a satellite, base station, or other central location to a receiver.  It refers to the transmission of data from a higher level to a lower level in a network. | Example: The satellite's downlink transmitted high-resolution images to the ground station.  卫星的下行链路将高分辨率图像传输到地面站。  The engineers are working to improve the downlink speed. 工程师们正在努力提高下行链路的速率。|近义词：descending link, downstream link |反义词：uplink


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The satellite downlinks data continuously. = 卫星持续向下行链路传输数据。
This system downlinks information to multiple receivers. = 此系统将信息下行链路传输到多个接收器。

一般过去时:
The downlink failed during the storm. = 暴风雨期间下行链路失败了。
The system downlinked the data successfully yesterday. = 系统昨天成功地向下行链路传输了数据。

现在完成时:
The satellite has downlinked terabytes of data this month. = 卫星本月已向下行链路传输了数TB的数据。
We have downlinked all the necessary information. = 我们已经下行链路传输了所有必要的信息。

过去完成时:
The system had downlinked the emergency signal before the power outage. = 系统在断电之前已经下行链路传输了紧急信号。
They had downlinked the data before the meeting. = 他们在会议之前已经下行链路传输了数据。

将来时:
The new system will downlink data at much higher speeds. = 新系统将以更高的速度向下行链路传输数据。
We will downlink the images as soon as they are processed. = 我们将在图像处理完毕后立即向下行链路传输。

虚拟语气:
If the downlink were stronger, we would receive a clearer signal. = 如果下行链路更强，我们将收到更清晰的信号。
I wish the downlink speed were faster. = 我希望下行链路速度更快。

被动语态:
The data was downlinked successfully. = 数据已成功下行链路传输。
The images are being downlinked now. = 图像正在下行链路传输中。

疑问句:
Is the downlink working properly? = 下行链路工作正常吗？
What is the bandwidth of the downlink? = 下行链路的带宽是多少？

否定句:
The downlink is not working. = 下行链路不工作。
The system did not downlink the data correctly. = 系统未正确向下行链路传输数据。


PHRASE->
downlink speed = 下行链路速度
downlink bandwidth = 下行链路带宽
downlink signal = 下行链路信号
downlink capacity = 下行链路容量
downlink interruption = 下行链路中断
