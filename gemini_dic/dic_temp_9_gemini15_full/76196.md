词源:

The word "fustian" ultimately derives from the Arabic word *fustān*, meaning "cotton cloth." This Arabic word entered various European languages, including Old French (*fustain*), Middle English (*fustyan*), and eventually evolved into the modern English "fustian."  The transition from simply meaning "cotton cloth" to also describing inflated language likely occurred because fustian cloth, being relatively coarse and possibly inexpensive, became associated with showy but ultimately cheap or insincere displays.
