词源:
The word "overexerting" is formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "exert," which comes from the Old French word "exert" (to exert, put forth).  The original Latin root is *exertus*, the past participle of *exergere*, meaning "to raise up," "to lift up," or "to rouse."  Therefore, "overexerting" literally means "exerting too much effort."
