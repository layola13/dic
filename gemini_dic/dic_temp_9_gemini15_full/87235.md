词源:

The word "heresy" comes from the Old French *heresie*, ultimately derived from the Late Latin *haeresis*, which in turn comes from the Greek *hairesis* (αἵρεσις), meaning "choice," "sect," or "school of thought."  Initially, *hairesis* was a neutral term referring to any philosophical or religious school of thought. However, its meaning shifted over time, particularly within the context of early Christianity, to denote a belief system considered contrary to official doctrine.
