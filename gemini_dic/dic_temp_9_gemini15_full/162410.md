preadherences: /ˌpriːˈæd(h)ərənsɪz/ | n. | 预先粘附；预先粘合 |  The term "preadherences" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, likely formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before) and "adherences" (referring to the act of sticking or clinging).  It would suggest a process of sticking or bonding that occurs before another event or process.  Therefore, the meaning is inferred based on its component parts.  | Example:  The preadherences of the sealant ensured a strong bond between the two surfaces. (预先粘合剂的预先粘附确保了两个表面之间的牢固结合。) | 近义词: prebonding, preattachment | 反义词:  post-adhesion, separation |  词性：名词
