percarbide: /ˈpɜːrkɑːbaɪd/ | n. | 过碳酸盐 | A salt containing the percarbonate anion (C₂O₆⁴⁻).  Percarbonates are strong oxidizing agents and are often used as bleaching agents and cleaning agents. They are typically produced by the reaction of hydrogen peroxide with carbonates. | Example: Sodium percarbonate is a common ingredient in many laundry detergents. 碳酸过钠是许多洗衣粉中的常见成分。 | 近义词: bleaching agent, oxidizing agent | 反义词:reducing agent
