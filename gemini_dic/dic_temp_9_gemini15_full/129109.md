The word "nivas" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a word from another language:**  "Nivas" might be a word from another language. If you can provide the language of origin, I might be able to help.
* **It's a proper noun or neologism:** It could be a proper noun (like a place name) or a newly coined word not yet widely recognized.

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you'd like me to assist you further.
