finalizer:/ˈfaɪnəlaɪzər/ | n. |终结器，完成器 | A finalizer is a method in object-oriented programming that is automatically called by the garbage collector when an object is about to be destroyed.  It's used to perform cleanup tasks such as releasing resources held by the object (like closing files or network connections).  | Example: In Java, the `finalize()` method acts as a finalizer.  The garbage collector calls it before reclaiming the memory occupied by an object.  In Python, the `__del__` method serves a similar purpose. |近义词：destructor, cleaner |反义词：initializer, constructor |名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The finalizer runs automatically. = 终结器自动运行。
The system uses a finalizer to clean up memory. = 系统使用终结器来清理内存。

一般过去时:
The finalizer completed its tasks successfully. = 终结器成功完成了它的任务。
The program executed the finalizer before exiting. = 程序在退出之前执行了终结器。


现在完成时:
The finalizer has already released all resources. = 终结器已经释放了所有资源。
The garbage collector has called the finalizer for this object. = 垃圾收集器已经为此对象调用了终结器。


过去完成时:
The finalizer had finished before the program crashed. = 程序崩溃之前，终结器已经完成了。
The system had run the finalizer multiple times. = 系统已经运行了多次终结器。


将来时:
The finalizer will run when the object is no longer referenced. = 当对象不再被引用时，终结器将运行。
The system will automatically invoke the finalizer. = 系统将自动调用终结器。


虚拟语气:
If the finalizer failed, the resources would not be released. = 如果终结器失败，资源将不会被释放。
It is important that the finalizer handles exceptions properly.  = 重要的是终结器能正确处理异常。


被动语态:
The finalizer is called by the garbage collector. = 终结器由垃圾收集器调用。
The resources are released by the finalizer. = 资源由终结器释放。


疑问句:
Does this language have a built-in finalizer? = 这门语言有内置的终结器吗？
When is the finalizer executed? = 终结器何时执行？


否定句:
The finalizer did not run properly. = 终结器没有正确运行。
The program does not use a finalizer for this object. = 该程序不为此对象使用终结器。



PHRASE->
finalizer method = 终结器方法
garbage collection finalizer = 垃圾回收终结器
object finalizer = 对象终结器
resource finalizer = 资源终结器
run finalizer = 运行终结器
