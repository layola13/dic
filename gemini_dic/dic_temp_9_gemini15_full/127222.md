/nɔːrəˈpɒmɪtər/ | n. |神经测量器，神经计 |A neuropometer is a hypothetical or theoretical instrument  that measures the activity or properties of neurons.  There is no known existing device with this name in common scientific usage. The term is likely a neologism (newly coined word) combining "neuro" (relating to nerves or the nervous system) and "pometer" (a suffix indicating a measuring instrument).  It suggests a device capable of quantifying aspects of neuronal function, such as firing rates, membrane potential, or neurotransmitter release. However, its precise function remains undefined due to its hypothetical nature. | Example:  (Hypothetical) The neuropometer recorded a significant increase in neuronal firing rates after the stimulation.  神经测量器记录到刺激后神经元放电率的显著增加。(假设) | 近义词:  (Depending on intended function)  neurometer, electromyograph, electroencephalograph | 反义词: N/A (as it describes a hypothetical measuring device, not a property)
