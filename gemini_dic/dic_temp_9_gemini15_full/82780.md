词源:  From guilt + -iness.  "Guilt" itself derives from the Old English word *gylt*, meaning "payment, fine, recompense,"  ultimately related to the Proto-Germanic *geldą, meaning "payment". The sense shifted to imply the penalty of wrongdoing, leading to the modern understanding of guilt. The suffix "-iness" is a common English suffix forming nouns of state or quality.
