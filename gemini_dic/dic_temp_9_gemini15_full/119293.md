词源:
The word "micro-environmental" is a compound word.  "Micro-" comes from the Greek word "mikros," meaning "small," and "environmental" is derived from "environment," ultimately from the Old French "environner," meaning "to surround."  Therefore, "micro-environmental" literally means relating to a small, surrounding environment.
