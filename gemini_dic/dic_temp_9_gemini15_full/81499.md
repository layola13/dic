词源:

The word "graver" comes from the Old French word "graveor," meaning "engraver" or "one who carves."  This, in turn, is derived from the Latin word "gravare," meaning "to weigh down," "to burden," or "to engrave."  The sense of "seriousness" in the adjective form evolved from the idea of something being weighty or burdensome.


用法说明:

As a noun, "graver" refers specifically to a tool used for engraving.  This usage is less common in modern English.

As an adjective, "graver" is the comparative form of "grave," meaning serious or important.  It indicates a higher degree of seriousness or importance compared to something else.  It is often used to emphasize the severity of a situation or the weight of a matter.
