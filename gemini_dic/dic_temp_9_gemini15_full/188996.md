The word "saaga" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  Perhaps you could provide more context where you encountered this word.

2. **It's a word from another language:**  "Saaga" might be a word from a different language, perhaps a Scandinavian language (like Icelandic or Norwegian) where it might mean "saga."  If so, please specify the language.

3. **It's a newly coined word or a proper noun:** It could be a neologism (newly invented word) or a proper noun (name of a person, place, or thing).

Without more information, I cannot provide a detailed analysis as requested.  To help me, please provide the source or context where you saw "saaga."
