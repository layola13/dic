词源:

The word "schoolmasterly" is derived from "schoolmaster" + "-ly".  "Schoolmaster" itself combines "school" (meaning a place of learning) and "master" (meaning a teacher or person in charge).  The "-ly" suffix transforms the noun "schoolmaster" into an adjective, describing something that resembles or possesses the qualities of a schoolmaster.
