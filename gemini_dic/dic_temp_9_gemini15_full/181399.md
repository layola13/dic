词源:

The word "reisolation" is a combination of "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") and "isolation" (the state of being separated from others).  "Isolation" itself comes from the Old French word "isolacion," derived from the Latin "insulare" (to make into an island), ultimately from "insula" (island). Therefore, "reisolation" literally means "to isolate again" or "to make into an island again."
