non-moral:/ˌnɒnˈmɒrəl/ | adj. | 非道德的，与道德无关的 | Not related to morality; neither moral nor immoral.  This term describes something that falls outside the sphere of moral judgment, rather than being inherently bad.  | Example:  The decision to wear a certain color is a non-moral choice.  这个穿某种颜色的决定是一个非道德的选择。

The choice of a career path is often a non-moral decision. 选择职业道路通常是一个非道德的决定。


近义词: amoral, unethically, unprincipled | 反义词: moral, ethical


词源:  The word is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "moral" (derived from Latin "moralis," meaning "relating to character or conduct").  Therefore, "non-moral" literally means "not moral," but it carries a nuanced meaning distinct from "immoral."
