英文解析:The term "eophytic" describes plants from the early stages of plant evolution, particularly those that predate the development of complex vascular systems. These plants were often simple, small, and lacked the intricate structures found in more advanced plants.  The study of eophytic plants helps scientists understand the evolutionary transitions that led to the diverse plant life we see today.
