capillation:/ˌkæpɪˈleɪʃən/ | n. |毛细作用；细管作用 |The process by which a liquid moves through a narrow tube, typically due to capillary action.  It's driven by the interaction between the liquid and the tube's surface. | Example: The capillation of water in the soil helps plants absorb moisture. 毛细作用使土壤中的水帮助植物吸收水分。|近义词：capillary action, wicking |反义词：None specifically, but the opposite would be a lack of capillary action.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Capillation explains how water rises in thin tubes. = 毛细作用解释了水如何在细管中上升。
The plant relies on capillation for water uptake. = 植物依靠毛细作用吸收水分。

一般过去时:
