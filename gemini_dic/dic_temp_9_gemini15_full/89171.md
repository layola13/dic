词源:
The word "homeopathically" is derived from "homeopathy," which itself comes from the Greek words "homoios" (similar) and "pathos" (suffering).  The suffix "-ically" indicates "in a manner of" or "in accordance with."  Therefore, homeopathically means "in a manner similar to the suffering," referring to the principle of homeopathy where like cures like.
