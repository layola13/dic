The word "nongolds" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a niche community or dialect.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide such an analysis, I would need a correctly spelled word or more context about its intended meaning.
