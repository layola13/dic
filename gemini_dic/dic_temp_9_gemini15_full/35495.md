coadapted:/ˌkoʊˈæptɪd/| adj.|协同适应的，共同适应的|Coadapted refers to the process where two or more species or traits have evolved together, each influencing the other's evolution in a reciprocal manner.  This often results in a mutually beneficial relationship or a tightly coupled system where the components are highly dependent on each other. | Example: The hummingbird and the trumpet-shaped flower are coadapted; the bird's long beak is perfectly suited for reaching the nectar deep within the flower, and the flower's shape ensures that only the hummingbird can effectively pollinate it. |近义词：interdependent, mutually adapted, synergistically evolved|反义词：independent, unadapted, antagonistic
