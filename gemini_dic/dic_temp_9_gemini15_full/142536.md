The word "osspringer" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a proper noun (like a name), or a word from a specialized field.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested are impossible without further context.  To provide a response following your requested format,  I need more information about the word's origin and intended meaning.
