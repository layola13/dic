interchannel:/ˌɪntərˈtʃænəl/| n. |信道间，通道间|The study of interchannel interference is crucial in communication systems.|近义词：inter-channel|反义词：intrachannel


英文解析:Relating to or occurring between channels; specifically, in communication systems, referring to interference or interaction between different channels.  It signifies the relationship or effects between separate communication pathways.

例句:

The engineers are working to reduce interchannel crosstalk in the new fiber optic cable. =工程师们正在努力减少新光纤电缆中的信道间串扰。

High levels of interchannel interference can lead to degraded signal quality. =高水平的信道间干扰会导致信号质量下降。


词源:

The word "interchannel" is a compound word formed from "inter-" and "channel."

* **inter-**: A prefix meaning "between," "among," or "mutually."  It derives from Latin "inter," meaning "between."

* **channel**:  Refers to a path or medium for transmitting something, such as information or signals.  Its origins trace back to Old French "chanel," and ultimately to Latin "canalis," meaning "pipe" or "canal."
