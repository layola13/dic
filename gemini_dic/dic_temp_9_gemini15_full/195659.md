semiring:/ˈsɛmɪrɪŋ/| n. |半环|A semiring is an algebraic structure that generalizes rings by relaxing the requirement that every element must have an additive inverse.  It consists of a set equipped with two binary operations, typically called addition and multiplication, that satisfy certain axioms.  These axioms are weaker than those of a ring, specifically lacking the requirement of additive inverses. Semirings find applications in various areas of mathematics and computer science, including automata theory, formal language theory, optimization, and tropical geometry.|Example: The set of natural numbers with the usual addition and multiplication forms a semiring.|近义词:  (No perfect synonyms, as it's a specific algebraic structure)|反义词: ring (in the sense that a ring is a stricter algebraic structure)|词性 n.


USAGE->
(Semiring itself does not have verb conjugations as it is a noun. The usage examples below demonstrate how the concept of a semiring is used in mathematical contexts.)

Example 1:
The nonnegative real numbers with standard addition and multiplication form a semiring. =  非负实数在标准加法和乘法下构成一个半环。

Example 2:
In tropical geometry, the max-plus semiring is frequently used. = 在热带几何中，常使用最大-加半环。


Example 3 (Illustrating application):
We can model a system of weighted automata using a semiring where the weights are drawn from the semiring. = 我们可以使用一个半环来模拟加权自动机系统，其中权重来自该半环。

Example 4 (Illustrating application):
The shortest path problem can be elegantly solved using algorithms based on semiring algebra. = 最短路径问题可以使用基于半环代数的算法巧妙地解决。


PHRASE->
(Phrases related to semirings are largely mathematical and specific to the field of abstract algebra.  Common phrases would include descriptions of specific types of semirings rather than general usage phrases.):

Example 1: Boolean semiring = 布尔半环

Example 2: Tropical semiring = 热带半环

Example 3: idempotent semiring = 幂等半环

Example 4:  commutative semiring = 交换半环

Example 5:  semiring homomorphism = 半环同态
