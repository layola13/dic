词源:  The word "cunningly" derives from the Middle English word "cunninge," meaning "skillful, knowledgeable." This, in turn, comes from the Old English word "cunnan," meaning "to know," which is related to the German word "kennen" (to know).  Over time, the meaning shifted to include a sense of slyness and deception, leading to the modern sense of "cunningly."
