scutibranchiate:/ˌskjuːtɪˈbræŋkiˌeɪt/| adj.|盾鳃类的；有盾鳃的|Having gills covered by a shield or operculum.  The term refers to a group of marine gastropods characterized by their gill structure.| Example:  Many scutibranchiate gastropods are found in intertidal zones.|近义词: operculate (referring to the operculum)|反义词:  N/A (no direct antonym, but one could use terms describing gastropods without opercula)|词性:形容词
