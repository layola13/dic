oxacid:/ˈɒksæsɪd/| n. |含氧酸|An oxacid is an acid that contains oxygen.  It is formed when a nonmetal oxide reacts with water. The general formula for an oxacid is HₓEOᵧ, where H represents hydrogen, E represents a nonmetal, and O represents oxygen.  The number of hydrogen and oxygen atoms (x and y) varies depending on the specific oxacid.  Oxacids are typically acidic in aqueous solution, meaning they release hydrogen ions (H⁺) when dissolved in water.|Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a strong oxacid used in many industrial processes.

Nitric acid (HNO₃) is another common oxacid used in the production of fertilizers and explosives.|近义词: oxyacid |反义词:  base (碱)
