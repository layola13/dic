Etymology:

The word "sidestepper" is a compound word formed from "sidestep" + "-er".

"Sidestep" itself is a compound verb, combining "side" (meaning "to the side") and "step" (meaning "to take a step").  Therefore, the literal meaning of "sidestep" is to move to one side, to step aside. Figuratively, it means to avoid something, especially a difficult or unpleasant situation or responsibility.

The suffix "-er" is a common nominalizing suffix in English, transforming verbs into nouns signifying a person who performs the action of the verb.  Thus, "sidestepper" denotes a person who habitually sidesteps responsibilities or difficulties.  The etymology traces back to the Old English words "sid" (side) and "steppan" (to step).
