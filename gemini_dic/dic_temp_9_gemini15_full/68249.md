The word "faithed" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To help, I need clarification:

* **Is this a misspelling?**  If so, please provide the intended word.  For example, did you mean "faith," "fathomed," "fainted," or another word?

* **Is this a newly coined word within a specific context?** If so, please provide the context (e.g., a book, article, or conversation) where you encountered it. This will help determine its intended meaning and usage.


Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.
