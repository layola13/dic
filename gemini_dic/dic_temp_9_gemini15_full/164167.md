词源:
The word "predissuaded" is formed by adding the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") to the verb "dissuade."  "Dissuade" itself comes from the Old French "dissuader," which is composed of the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away" or "apart") and "suader" (meaning "to persuade").  Therefore, "predissuade" literally means "to persuade someone away from something beforehand," although the "beforehand" aspect is often implied rather than explicitly stated.
