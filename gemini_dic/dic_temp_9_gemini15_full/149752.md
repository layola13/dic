palatalizing: /ˈpælətəlaɪzɪŋ/ | v. |软腭化；颚化| The process of articulating a sound with the tongue near or touching the hard palate.  This often involves a change in the pronunciation of a consonant, making it sound softer or higher in pitch.  It's a common phenomenon in many languages, affecting both consonants and vowels. | 例句：The palatalizing of /k/ to /c/ is a common sound change in many Romance languages.  许多罗曼语中/k/软腭化成/c/是很常见的音变。

The palatalizing of consonants frequently occurs before high vowels.  辅音的软腭化经常发生在高元音之前。
