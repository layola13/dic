WORD ORIGIN->
The word "extractability" is derived from the verb "extract" (to remove or obtain something from something else) and the suffix "-ability" (which indicates capacity or potential).  "Extract" itself has Latin roots, ultimately stemming from the verb "ex" (out) + "trahere" (to draw or pull).
