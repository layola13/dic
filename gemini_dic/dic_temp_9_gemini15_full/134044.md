词源:

The word "nonideals" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "ideals."  "Ideals" originates from the Late Latin word "idealis,"  itself derived from the classical Latin "idea," meaning "form," "shape," or "concept."  Therefore, "nonideals" literally means "not ideals," referring to things that fall short of perfect or optimal standards.
