manness's:/ˈmænɪsɪz/| n. | 男子气概；男子汉气概 |  The word "manness's" is not a standard English word. It appears to be an incorrect or unusual formation, possibly a misspelling or a possessive form of a non-standard word "manness".  "Manness" itself is rarely used and suggests the qualities of being a man.  Therefore, "manness's" would likely refer to the qualities of a specific man, or something belonging to those qualities. |  There are no standard examples.  A possible (though grammatically questionable) example could be:  "The judge admired the defendant's manness's in facing the accusations." (This implies admiration for the defendant's masculine strength or courage in a specific instance.)|  近义词:masculinity, manliness, virility | 反义词:femininity, effeminacy | 名词
