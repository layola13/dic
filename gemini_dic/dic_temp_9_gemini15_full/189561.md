词源:  sales (销售) + girl (女孩)  A simple compound word formed by combining "sales," referring to the act of selling, and "girl," indicating the gender of the person involved.  The word reflects a time when predominantly women worked in retail sales positions.  The term is now seen as somewhat dated and potentially less inclusive than "sales associate" or "shop assistant."
