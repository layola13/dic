词源:

The word "non-domesticated" is a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "domesticated."  "Domesticated" comes from the Latin word "domesticus," meaning "of the house" or "belonging to the house," ultimately derived from "domus," meaning "house."  Therefore, "non-domesticated" literally means "not belonging to the house" or "not tamed and brought under human control."
