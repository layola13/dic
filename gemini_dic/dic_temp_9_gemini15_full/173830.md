quasi-prepositionally: /ˈkwɑːzaɪ ˌpreˌpɒzɪˈʃənəli/ | adv. | 准介词地，类似介词地 |


英文解析：The adverb "quasi-prepositionally" describes the use of a word or phrase in a manner resembling or functionally similar to a preposition, but not strictly conforming to the grammatical definition of a preposition.  It often refers to words or phrases that exhibit preposition-like behavior in terms of governing a noun phrase or modifying a verb, but lack the typical characteristics of a true preposition (e.g., being a single word, having a fixed meaning, etc.).


例句：

The phrase "in terms of" is often used quasi-prepositionally, introducing a specification or clarification.  = 短语“就……而言”通常以准介词的方式使用，引出说明或解释。


The adverb "regarding" functions quasi-prepositionally in the sentence "Regarding your question..." = 副词“关于”在句子“关于你的问题……”中起着准介词的作用。


近义词：prepositionally (but implies a true preposition), adverbially (if the word is an adverb),  adjectivally (if the word is an adjective),  like a preposition


反义词：This word doesn't have a direct antonym. The opposite would be describing a word used *not* in a preposition-like way.


词性：副词


USAGE->  (This word is an adverb, so it doesn't have the same grammatical variations as a verb or noun.  It modifies verbs or entire clauses.)


PHRASE-> (Quasi-prepositional phrases are numerous; examples would depend on the specific language.)  There are no standard, common phrases built specifically around "quasi-prepositionally". The usage of the word itself describes the function of other phrases.
