词源:
The word "dispurveyance" combines the prefix "dis-" (meaning "lack of" or "absence of") with "purveyance," which historically referred to the provision of food and supplies.  Purveyance itself comes from the Old French word "pourveance," ultimately deriving from the verb "pourvoir," meaning "to provide."  Therefore, dispurveyance indicates a lack or failure of provision.
