It is primarily found in older texts and might appear in specialized scientific contexts.  There are no common synonyms or antonyms, as the word itself is uncommon.

例句：
The protense rope threatened to snap under the weight. = 绷紧的绳子在重量下有断裂的危险。


There are no common usages, tenses, phrases, etc. to illustrate as the word is extremely rare and not a part of common modern English vocabulary.  Its archaic nature prevents standard grammatical analysis in the way requested for a frequently used word.
