The word "liteness's" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a misspelling or a non-standard formation.  There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries.  It's likely a combination of "liteness" (itself not a common word, possibly intending "lightness") and the possessive 's.

Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format. To help, I can offer analysis of potential intended words:
