parasympathetic: /ˌpærəˌsɪmpəˈθɛtɪk/ | adj. | 副交感的；副交感神经的 | Relating to the parasympathetic nervous system, which counteracts the effects of the sympathetic nervous system and is involved in such functions as slowing the heart rate, stimulating digestion, and constricting pupils.  | The parasympathetic nervous system helps regulate the body's rest and digest response. |近义词：cholinergic (in some contexts) |反义词：sympathetic


英文解析:The parasympathetic nervous system is one of the two main divisions of the autonomic nervous system.  It is responsible for the "rest and digest" functions of the body, slowing the heart rate, stimulating digestion, and generally promoting relaxation.  It counteracts the effects of the sympathetic nervous system ("fight or flight").
