The word "rewarranted" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  However, we can analyze its potential meaning and components based on its likely derivation:


It seems to be a combination of "re-" (meaning again, anew) and "warranted" (justified or authorized).  Therefore, a possible interpretation would be "warranted again" or "justified anew."


Let's assume, for the sake of illustration, that "rewarranted" were to be accepted as a word. Then we could create a hypothetical entry:


rewarranted: /ˌriːˈwɒrəntɪd/ (US: /ˌriːˈwɔːrəntɪd/) | adj. | 再次保证的；再次证明合理的；重新授权的 |  Justified or authorized again; requiring renewed guarantee or assurance. |


Example Sentences (Hypothetical):

After the initial warranty expired, the manufacturer rewarranted the product due to a manufacturing defect.  =  在最初的保修期结束后，由于制造缺陷，制造商再次为产品提供保修。


The court’s decision was rewarranted after new evidence emerged. = 在出现新的证据后，法院的判决得到了再次确认。


Near Synonyms (Hypothetical):  re-justified, reaffirmed, reauthorized, re-guaranteed


Antonyms (Hypothetical):  unjustified, invalidated, disproven


Because "rewarranted" isn't a real word, providing a complete usage section with tenses, moods, and voices is inappropriate.  The hypothetical usage would mirror that of an adjective.  Similarly, creating example phrases is not possible without creating completely artificial constructions.
