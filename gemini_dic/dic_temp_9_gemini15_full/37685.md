词源:
The word "companiable" derives from the Old French word "compaignie," meaning "company" or "fellowship," which itself comes from the Latin word "compagnia," a combination of "cum" (with) and "panis" (bread).  The implication is that sharing bread was a fundamental act of companionship.  The "-able" suffix is added to create the adjective form, meaning "capable of being" or "worthy of."  Therefore, "companiable" literally means "worthy of company" or "capable of good company."
