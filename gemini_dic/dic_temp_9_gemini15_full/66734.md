词源:

The word "exorciser" is derived from the verb "exorcise," which comes from the Late Latin word "exorcismus," meaning "adjuration," "exorcism," or "conjuration." This in turn originates from the Greek word "exorkizein," meaning "to conjure," "to adjure," or "to bind by oath."  The "-er" suffix indicates the person who performs the action.
