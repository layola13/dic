词源:  From the verb "league," meaning to form a league or alliance.  The word "league" itself ultimately derives from the Old French word "ligue," meaning "league, bond, tie," which in turn has roots in the Latin word "ligare," meaning "to bind."  Therefore, "leaguing" reflects the action of binding or uniting together.
