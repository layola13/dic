词源:

The word "exhibitionists" is derived from the noun "exhibition," which comes from the Late Middle English word "exhibition," meaning "a showing or display." This, in turn, originated from the Old French word "exhibición,"  derived from the Latin word "exhibitio," meaning "a presenting, a showing forth." The suffix "-ist" is added to create the noun referring to a person who engages in exhibition.
