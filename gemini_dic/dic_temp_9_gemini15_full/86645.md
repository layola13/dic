PHRASE-> (由于hellbrewed本身就是一个完整的词，没有常见的固定搭配短语。)


词源:  The word is a compound of "hell" (referring to the underworld or a place of evil) and "brewed" (implying something concocted or created, often in a sinister manner). The "brewed" part evokes images of potions, conspiracies, or generally malevolent activities.  It's a relatively modern coinage, likely arising from creative wordplay rather than having a long etymological history.
