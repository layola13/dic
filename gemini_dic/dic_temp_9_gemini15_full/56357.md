The word "doie" is not a recognized word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries or lexicons.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and further grammatical analysis as requested.  It is likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific dialect or jargon, or a proper noun.  More context is needed to understand its intended meaning.
