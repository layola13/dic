词源:
The origin of "poshy" is uncertain but it's believed to be of slang origin, possibly related to the nautical term "posh," an abbreviation of "port out, starboard home," referring to the most luxurious cabins on passenger ships.  The transition from nautical term to slang adjective describing luxury is unclear, but the association with wealth and comfort is evident.
