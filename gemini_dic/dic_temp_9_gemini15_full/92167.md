词源:

The word "hypersophisticated" is a combination of "hyper-" (meaning "excessive" or "beyond") and "sophisticated" (meaning "complex" or "refined").  "Sophisticated" itself has roots tracing back to the Old French *sophisticat*, ultimately deriving from the Latin *sophisticatus*, the past participle of *sophisticare*, meaning "to refine," itself from the Greek *sophistikos* ("skilled in argument," "clever").  Therefore, "hypersophisticated" implies a level of complexity or refinement that goes beyond what is necessary or practical.
