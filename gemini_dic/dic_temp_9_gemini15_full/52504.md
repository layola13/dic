词源:
The word "differencing" derives from the verb "to differ," meaning to be unlike or distinct.  The "-ence" suffix forms a noun indicating a state or quality, and the "-ing" suffix transforms it into a gerund (verb acting as a noun) or present participle (verb form describing an ongoing action).  Its mathematical usage evolved from the fundamental operation of subtraction, representing the finding of a difference.
