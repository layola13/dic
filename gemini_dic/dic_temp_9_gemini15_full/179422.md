reducer:/rɪˈduːsər/ | n. |化简器；还原剂；减速器 | A reducer is a person or thing that reduces something. In computer science, it's a function that takes a collection of inputs and reduces them to a single output value.  It's also a device that reduces speed or pressure. | Example: The chemical acted as a reducer in the reaction.  这个化学物质在反应中充当还原剂。 The gearbox acts as a reducer, slowing the engine's speed.  变速箱充当减速器，降低发动机的速度。|近义词：diminisher, lessener, decelerator |反义词：augmenter, increaser, accelerator |名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The reducer processes the data efficiently. = 化简器高效地处理数据。
The engineer designs a new speed reducer. = 工程师设计了一个新的减速器。


一般过去时:
The chemical reducer completed the reaction. = 化学还原剂完成了反应。
The mechanic replaced the old reducer. = 机械师更换了旧的减速器。


现在完成时:
The system has successfully reduced the data. = 系统已成功地减少了数据。
We have installed a new pressure reducer. = 我们安装了一个新的减压器。


过去完成时:
The program had already reduced the file size before the error occurred. = 程序在错误发生之前已经减小了文件大小。
They had used a different reducer in the previous experiment. = 他们在之前的实验中使用了不同的还原剂。


将来时:
The new reducer will improve the system's performance. = 新的减速器将提高系统的性能。
They will install a more efficient reducer next week. = 他们下周将安装一个更高效的减速器。


虚拟语气:
If we had a better reducer, the process would be faster. = 如果我们有一个更好的减速器，这个过程就会更快。
I wish we had chosen a more powerful reducer. = 我希望我们选择了更强大的还原剂。


被动语态:
The data was reduced by the reducer. = 数据由化简器减少。
The speed was reduced by the reducer. = 速度由减速器降低。


疑问句:
What type of reducer is used in this machine? = 这台机器使用哪种类型的减速器？
What is the function of the reducer in this system? = 此系统中减速器的功能是什么？


否定句:
The reducer did not function correctly. = 减速器未正常工作。
This chemical is not a strong reducer. = 此化学物质不是强还原剂。


PHRASE->
speed reducer: 减速器
pressure reducer: 减压器
data reducer: 数据化简器
noise reducer: 降噪器
gear reducer: 齿轮减速器
