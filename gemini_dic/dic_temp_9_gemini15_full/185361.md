retrocopulant: /ˌrɛtroʊˈkɒpjələnt/ | n. | 逆向交配剂，反向交配物质 | A substance that reverses the effects of a copulant, often used in the context of pheromones or other chemical signals involved in mating behavior.  It disrupts or inhibits mating behavior by interfering with the signals that normally attract or stimulate copulation. | Example:  The researchers synthesized a retrocopulant to study its effect on the mating behavior of the insects.  研究人员合成了逆向交配剂来研究其对昆虫交配行为的影响。| 近义词:  anti-aphrodisiac (though not a perfect synonym as it has a broader application)| 反义词: copulant, aphrodisiac |  名词
