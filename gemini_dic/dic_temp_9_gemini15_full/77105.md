The word originates from the Latin word "garrire," meaning "to chatter" or "to babble."  The suffix "-ous" transforms it into an adjective ("garrulous"), and the suffix "-ness" adds the noun quality, creating "garrulousness." The addition of "-es" forms the plural.

Garrulousnesses is used to describe multiple instances or facets of excessive talkativeness. It's less common than "garrulousness," but appropriate when emphasizing the repeated or varied nature of someone's talkativeness.  It's generally used in a descriptive rather than a prescriptive manner.  The word carries a slightly negative connotation, suggesting that the excessive talking is undesirable or unproductive.
