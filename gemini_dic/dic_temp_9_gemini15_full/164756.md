词源:
The word "prefer" comes from the Old French word "preferer," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "praeferre."  "Praeferre" is a compound of "prae" (before, in front of) and "ferre" (to carry, to bear).  The original meaning thus implied "to carry or bring forward," suggesting a choice or preference for one thing over another.
