/nɒnˈnætɪlinɛsɪz/ | n. | 非时髦；不讲究；不雅致 | The word "nonnattilynesses" is not a standard English word.  It's a nonce word, meaning it's created for a specific occasion and is unlikely to be found in dictionaries. It's formed by adding "-nesses" (a pluralizing suffix indicating qualities or states) to "nonnattily" (itself a negative form of "nattily," meaning smartly dressed or stylish). Therefore, it would imply a collection or multiplicity of unstylish or inelegant qualities or states.  There are no standard examples, synonyms, or antonyms because the word is not established in the lexicon. |  No example sentences are available for a non-existent word. |  N/A | N/A | noun
