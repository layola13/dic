epigraphs:/ˈɛpɪɡræfs/ | n. |题词；引言；铭文 | A short quotation or saying at the beginning of a book, chapter, or other piece of writing, intended to suggest its theme.  Epigraphs are often chosen for their evocative power or their relevance to the work's central ideas. They can provide context, foreshadow events, or simply add a layer of intellectual richness. | Example: The novel began with an epigraph from Shakespeare's Hamlet, hinting at the themes of betrayal and revenge. 这部小说以莎士比亚《哈姆雷特》中的一段题词开头，暗示了背叛和复仇的主题。|近义词：quotation, motto, inscription, preface |反义词：None directly opposite, but could be considered opposite to a work lacking introductory context.

WORD ORIGIN->

From Greek ἐπιγραφή (epigraphḗ), from ἐπιγράφειν (epigraphéin) "to write upon," from ἐπί (epí) "upon" + γράφειν (graphein) "to write."  The word's evolution reflects its literal meaning of "something written upon" something else.
