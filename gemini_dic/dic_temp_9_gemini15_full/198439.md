词源:  Derived from "shrewd" + "-ish," the suffix indicating a somewhat lesser degree or a resemblance to the quality. "Shrewd" itself has uncertain origins, possibly related to Old English words suggesting "evil" or "wicked," but its current meaning is overwhelmingly positive. The shift in connotation reflects how cunning and cleverness, once associated with negative actions, are now often seen as desirable traits in certain contexts.
