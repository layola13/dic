/ˌnɒnæbˈstræktɪdnɪsəz/ | n. | 非抽象性；非抽象的事物 | The word "nonabstractednesses" is a very rare and unusual word, formed by combining several prefixes and suffixes to the root word "abstract." It refers to the qualities or things that are not abstract, i.e., concrete and tangible.  It's a highly complex and cumbersome word and generally avoided in favor of simpler alternatives.  Its meaning is essentially the opposite of "abstractedness."  Because of its length and rarity, finding examples in common usage is difficult, and constructing natural-sounding sentences is challenging.  |  (No readily available examples in common usage due to the word's rarity and unwieldiness.) | concreteness, tangibility | abstractedness, abstractness | 名词
