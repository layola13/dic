词源:
The word "discriminate" originates from the Latin word "discriminare," meaning "to distinguish," "to separate," or "to discern."  The prefix "dis-" means "apart" or "away," and the root "-criminare" is related to "crimen," meaning "judgment" or "decision."  Over time, the word's meaning evolved to include the negative connotation of unfair or prejudiced treatment.
