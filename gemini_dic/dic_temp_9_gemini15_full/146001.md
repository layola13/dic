overdominates:/ˌoʊvərˈdɑːmɪneɪts/| v.|显性上位；超显性|To exhibit overdominance; to be expressed more strongly in heterozygotes than in either homozygote.  This term is primarily used in genetics and refers to a situation where a heterozygous genotype (having two different alleles of a gene) shows a more extreme phenotype (observable characteristic) than either of the homozygous genotypes (having two identical alleles).| Example: The hybrid vigor observed in many plant species is often due to genes that overdominate.  杂种优势在许多植物物种中观察到，这通常是由于显性上位基因造成的。


Example: In this experiment, the heterozygotes for the gene responsible for flower color overdominated, resulting in significantly darker flowers compared to either homozygous plants. 在这项实验中，负责花色的基因的杂合子表现出显性上位，导致与任何纯合子植物相比，花朵颜色明显更深。


近义词:exceeds, surpasses, outperforms|反义词:underdominates


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The hybrid vigor overdominates the parental lines. = 杂种优势超过亲本系。
This gene overdominates in heterozygotes. = 这个基因在杂合子中表现出显性上位。


一般过去时:
The results overdominated the previous findings. = 结果超过了之前的发现。
The experiment showed that the trait overdominated in the heterozygous condition. = 实验表明，该性状在杂合状态下表现出显性上位。


现在完成时:
Researchers have found that many traits have overdominated in hybrid populations. = 研究人员已经发现，许多性状在杂交种群中表现出显性上位。
This phenomenon has overdominated our expectations. = 这种现象超过了我们的预期。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, scientists had hypothesized that the gene would overdominate. = 在实验之前，科学家们假设该基因会表现出显性上位。

将来时:
We expect that the new variety will overdominate the existing ones. = 我们预计新品种将超过现有品种。
The improved yield will likely overdominate previous records. =  改良后的产量可能会超过之前的记录。


虚拟语气:
If the gene overdominated, we would observe a stronger phenotype. = 如果基因表现出显性上位，我们将观察到更强的表型。
It is essential that the results overdominate the null hypothesis. = 结果必须超过零假设。


被动语态:
The effect of overdominance was observed in the hybrid plants. = 在杂交植物中观察到显性上位效应。
The superiority of the hybrid was attributed to genes that were overdominated. = 杂交种的优越性归因于表现出显性上位的基因。


疑问句:
Does this gene overdominate in this particular population? =  这个基因在这个特定种群中表现出显性上位吗？
Will the new treatment overdominate the effects of the disease? = 新疗法会超过疾病的影响吗？


否定句:
The trait did not overdominate in the homozygous state. =  该性状在纯合状态下没有表现出显性上位。
The evidence does not suggest that the gene overdominates. =  证据并不表明该基因表现出显性上位。


PHRASE->
