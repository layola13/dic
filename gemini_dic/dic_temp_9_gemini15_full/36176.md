词源:
The word "coffin" comes from the Old French word "cofin," which ultimately derives from the Vulgar Latin word "copina," meaning "basket."  The original meaning referred to a large basket, and the association with burial likely developed because early coffins were sometimes made from woven materials similar to large baskets.
