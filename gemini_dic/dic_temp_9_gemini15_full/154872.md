词源:

The word "pervertedness" derives from the adjective "perverted," which in turn comes from the verb "pervert."  "Pervert" originates from the Old French word "pervertir," meaning "to corrupt, destroy." This further traces back to the Latin "pervertere," a compound of "per-" (completely, thoroughly) and "vertere" (to turn).  Therefore, the root meaning involves a complete turning away from the right or proper course.  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating the state or quality of being perverted.
