词源:

The word "dictatorial" is derived from the Latin word "dictator,"  meaning "one who dictates."  In ancient Rome, a dictator was a magistrate appointed during times of crisis with absolute power, but their authority was temporary. The modern usage of "dictatorial" retains the sense of absolute power but typically implies a negative connotation of tyranny and oppression.
