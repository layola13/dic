词源:

The word "button" originates from the Middle English word "botoun," which itself comes from the Old French "boton," meaning "a bud" or "a knob."  The association with clothing fasteners comes from the resemblance of early buttons to small knobs or buds. The use of buttons to operate mechanisms is a later development.
