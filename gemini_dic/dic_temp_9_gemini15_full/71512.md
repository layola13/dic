词源:
The word "flannel" itself has an unclear and debated etymology.  The most widely accepted theory traces it back to a Welsh word, possibly "gwlanen," meaning "wool."  It entered English in the 17th century and initially referred to a type of coarse woolen cloth from Wales.  Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass various soft, napped fabrics, not just those made from wool.
