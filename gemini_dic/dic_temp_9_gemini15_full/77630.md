The word "gelan" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
2. **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name (person, place, or thing) or a brand name.
3. **It's from another language:** It could be a word from a different language, and you've encountered it in a specific context.  If you can provide that context (e.g., the sentence it was used in, the language it originated from), I might be able to help.

Please provide more information so I can assist you.
