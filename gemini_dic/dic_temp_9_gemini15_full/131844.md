nonconstituent: /ˌnɒnkənˈstɪtʃuənt/ | adj. | 非成分的；非结构成分的 |  A nonconstituent is a linguistic unit that does not form a constituent, meaning it's not a grammatical unit that functions as a single element within a larger phrase or sentence.  It lacks the syntactic properties of a true constituent and cannot be moved or substituted as a single unit.  For example, in the phrase "the very tall man," "very tall" forms a constituent (an adjective phrase modifying "man"), but "very" alone is a nonconstituent. | The analysis showed that "very" was a nonconstituent within the noun phrase.  This sentence contains a nonconstituent phrase. |  constituent, phrase |  constituent, phrase
