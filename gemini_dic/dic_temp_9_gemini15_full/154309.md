peritonitises:/ˌpɛrɪtənaɪˈtaɪsɪz/ | v. | 腹膜炎（的复数形式）|  The word "peritonitises" is the plural form of the verb "peritonitize," meaning "to cause peritonitis."  It's rarely used in this form, as "peritonitis" is usually treated as a noun. |  The doctor suspects the patient peritonitises  due to a ruptured appendix.| 近义词: inflames (the peritoneum)| 反义词: heals (the peritoneum)| 动词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The surgeon peritonitises the patient with a bacterial infection. = 外科医生诊断病人因细菌感染而患有腹膜炎。(This sentence uses the verb in an unusual and arguably incorrect way.  It is grammatically correct but semantically odd.  A more natural phrasing would focus on the diagnosis of peritonitis.)
He rarely peritonitises his patients with such severe cases. = 他很少诊断病人患有如此严重的腹膜炎。(Again, semantically awkward.  Better phrasing is needed.)

一般过去时:
The infection peritonitised the patient quickly. = 感染迅速导致病人患上腹膜炎。(This is a more natural use, though still uncommon.)
The surgeon said the appendix rupture peritonitised the patient. = 外科医生说阑尾破裂导致病人患上腹膜炎。

现在完成时:
The bacteria have peritonitised many patients this year. = 今年细菌已经导致许多病人患上腹膜炎。(Again, semantically awkward.  Focus on the infection, not the verb peritonitize.)
The untreated wound has peritonitised the patient.  = 未经处理的伤口导致病人患上腹膜炎.

过去完成时:
The doctor realized that the patient had already been peritonitised before the surgery. = 医生意识到病人已经在手术前患上腹膜炎了。(Uncommon and awkward phrasing.)
The appendix had peritonitised the patient before the symptoms manifested. = 阑尾在症状出现之前就已经导致病人患上腹膜炎了。


将来时:
The untreated injury will likely peritonitize the patient. = 未经治疗的损伤很可能会导致病人患上腹膜炎。(This is a more acceptable future tense usage.)
If left untreated, the infection will peritonitize the patient. = 如果不治疗，感染将会导致病人患上腹膜炎。


虚拟语气:
If the appendix had not ruptured, the patient would not have been peritonitised. = 如果阑尾没有破裂，病人就不会患上腹膜炎。
If the infection had been treated earlier, the patient might not have been peritonitised. = 如果感染早些治疗，病人可能就不会患上腹膜炎。


被动语态:
The patient was peritonitised by a bacterial infection. = 病人因细菌感染而患上腹膜炎。(More natural to say "The patient developed peritonitis...")
The patient was peritonitised by a perforated ulcer. = 病人因溃疡穿孔而患上腹膜炎。(Again, less common and awkward.)


疑问句:
Was the patient peritonitised? = 病人患有腹膜炎吗？(Better to ask: Did the patient develop peritonitis?)
How was the patient peritonitised? = 病人是如何患上腹膜炎的？(Awkward; better to ask: What caused the patient's peritonitis?)


否定句:
The patient was not peritonitised. = 病人没有患上腹膜炎。(More natural to say: The patient did not have peritonitis.)
The infection did not peritonitize the patient. = 感染没有导致病人患上腹膜炎。(Again, phrasing is awkward.)
