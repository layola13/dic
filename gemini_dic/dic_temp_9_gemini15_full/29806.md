caudicula:/kɔːˈdɪkjʊlə/| n. |花粉块柄；花药柄|A caudicula is a stalk or appendage that connects the pollinia (masses of pollen) to the viscidium (sticky substance) in orchids and other plants.  It is a crucial structure for pollen transfer.  The caudicula's structure and length vary significantly between orchid species and play a role in pollination mechanisms.|Example: The orchid's caudicula was long and slender, facilitating efficient pollination by its specific pollinator.|近义词：stalk (in this specific context)|反义词：None directly applicable.


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The caudicula connects the pollinia to the viscidium. = 花粉块柄连接花粉块和粘盘。
The caudicula's length varies among species. = 花粉块柄的长度在不同物种之间有所不同。


一般过去时:
The botanist examined the caudicula under a microscope. = 植物学家在显微镜下检查了花粉块柄。
The caudicula broke during the pollination process. = 花粉块柄在授粉过程中断裂了。


现在完成时:
Researchers have studied the caudicula's role in pollination. = 研究人员已经研究了花粉块柄在授粉中的作用。
Scientists have observed various caudicula structures in different orchids. = 科学家在不同的兰花中观察到了各种各样的花粉块柄结构。


过去完成时:
Before the pollinator visited, the caudicula was intact. = 在传粉者来访之前，花粉块柄是完整的。
The caudicula had already detached from the viscidium before the observation. = 在观察之前，花粉块柄已经从粘盘上脱落了。


将来时:
Scientists will analyze the caudicula's genetic makeup. = 科学家将分析花粉块柄的基因构成。
We will observe how the caudicula functions in pollination. = 我们将观察花粉块柄在授粉中的功能。


虚拟语气:
If the caudicula were longer, pollination might be more efficient. = 如果花粉块柄更长，授粉效率可能会更高。
I wish I had observed the caudicula more closely. = 我希望我当时更仔细地观察了花粉块柄。


被动语态:
The caudicula was carefully removed for analysis. = 花粉块柄被小心地取下进行分析。
The caudicula's structure is being studied by researchers. = 花粉块柄的结构正在被研究人员研究。


疑问句:
What is the function of the caudicula? = 花粉块柄的功能是什么？
What is the length of the caudicula in this species? = 这个物种的花粉块柄长度是多少？


否定句:
The orchid did not have a visible caudicula. = 这朵兰花没有可见的花粉块柄。
The caudicula was not attached to the pollinia. = 花粉块柄没有附着在花粉块上。
