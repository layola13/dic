词源:

The word "pantological" is derived from the Greek words "pan" (παν) meaning "all" and "logos" (λόγος) meaning "word," "speech," or "reason."  The combination suggests something encompassing all aspects or knowledge.  The "-ical" suffix indicates an adjective.


用法说明:

Pantological is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that is comprehensive, all-inclusive, or universal in scope.  It suggests a completeness that leaves nothing out.  However, due to its relatively infrequent use, it might sound overly formal or even pedantic in casual conversation.  It is more often encountered in academic or literary contexts.


例句:

His pantological approach to the problem ensured he considered every possible solution. 他对问题的包罗万象的方法确保他考虑了所有可能的解决方案。
