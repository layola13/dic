词源:
The word "ritziness" is derived from the Ritz-Carlton hotels, which are renowned for their luxurious accommodations and service.  The name "Ritz" itself is associated with opulence and high social standing, originating with César Ritz, a Swiss hotelier who established a reputation for creating lavish and elegant hotels.  Therefore, "ritziness" essentially means "the quality or state of being like a Ritz-Carlton hotel"—exuding luxury and high-class refinement.
