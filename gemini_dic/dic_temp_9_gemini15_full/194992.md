词源:
The word "semi-tropical" is a compound word.  "Semi" is derived from Latin "semi-", meaning "half," "partly," or "partially." "Tropical" comes from the Latin word "tropicalis," which relates to the tropics, the region between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn.  Therefore, "semi-tropical" describes a climate or region that possesses some, but not all, of the characteristics of a tropical climate.
