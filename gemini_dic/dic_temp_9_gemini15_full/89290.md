homoeomeric:/ˌhoʊmiəˈmɛrɪk/| adj. |同质的，同源的 |Of the same or similar nature or structure; homogeneous.  The term often refers to parts of an organism that are similar in structure and origin, even if they have different functions.  | Example: The repeated segments of an annelid worm's body are considered homoeomeric.  | 近义词：homogeneous, uniform, similar | 反义词：heterogeneous, dissimilar |


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The repeated segments are considered homoeomeric. = 重复的部分被认为是同质的。
These structures show homoeomeric features. = 这些结构显示出同质的特征。


一般过去时:
Scientists classified those segments as homoeomeric. = 科学家将这些部分归类为同质的。
Researchers found the structures to be homoeomeric. = 研究人员发现这些结构是同质的。


现在完成时:
Studies have shown the homoeomeric nature of these parts. = 研究已经表明了这些部分的同质性。
We have identified several homoeomeric regions in the genome. = 我们已经在基因组中识别出几个同质区域。


过去完成时:
They had already determined the segments were homoeomeric before the experiment. = 他们在实验之前就已经确定这些部分是同质的了。
Researchers had previously identified these structures as homoeomeric. = 研究人员先前已将这些结构识别为同质的。


将来时:
Further research will reveal more homoeomeric structures. = 进一步的研究将揭示更多同质结构。
Scientists will likely classify these new findings as homoeomeric. = 科学家可能会将这些新发现归类为同质的。


虚拟语气:
If the segments were homoeomeric, the results would be different. = 如果这些部分是同质的，结果就会不同。
It would be helpful if we knew whether these structures are homoeomeric. = 如果我们知道这些结构是否同质，将会很有帮助。


被动语态:
The segments were considered homoeomeric by the researchers. = 这些部分被研究人员认为是同质的。
The homoeomeric nature of these structures was confirmed. = 这些结构的同质性得到了证实。


疑问句:
Are these structures homoeomeric? = 这些结构是同质的吗？
Is the repeated pattern homoeomeric in nature? = 重复的模式本质上是同质的吗？


否定句:
The segments are not homoeomeric; they are heterogeneous. = 这些部分不是同质的；它们是异质的。
The findings did not support the hypothesis of homoeomeric structures. = 研究结果不支持同质结构的假设。


PHRASE->
homoeomeric repetition = 同质重复
homoeomeric structures = 同质结构
homoeomeric segmentation = 同质分节
homoeomeric development = 同质发育
homoeomeric genes = 同源基因
