词源:

The word "reilluminations" is derived from the verb "to illuminate," which comes from the Latin word "illūmināre," meaning "to light up," "to brighten," or "to enlighten." The prefix "re-" indicates repetition or renewal.  Therefore, "reilluminations" literally means "to light up again" or "to enlighten again," but also figuratively means to clarify, explain, or interpret something again with new understanding.
