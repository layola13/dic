词源:
The word "pavement" comes from the Old French word "pavement," meaning "paving" or "a paved surface."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "paviare," meaning "to pave" or "to lay stones."  The evolution reflects the historical practice of paving roads and walkways for improved access and travel.
