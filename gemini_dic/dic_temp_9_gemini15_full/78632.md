gibibyte:/ˈdʒɪbɪbaɪt/| n. |吉比字节|A gibibyte (GiB) is a unit of information or computer storage equal to 2<sup>30</sup> bytes (1,073,741,824 bytes).  It is a binary prefix unit, meaning it's based on powers of 2, unlike the gigabyte (GB), which is based on powers of 10.  The term is used to avoid confusion between the binary and decimal interpretations of the gigabyte.  | Example: The hard drive has a capacity of 1 terabyte, which is equal to 1024 gibibytes.  这个硬盘的容量为1太字节，相当于1024吉比字节。|近义词：gigabyte (in informal contexts, but with potential ambiguity)|反义词：None (units of measurement don't have direct opposites)|名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb or adjective forms, so tense conjugation is irrelevant.  It’s used as a unit of measurement.

Example 1:  The server's RAM is 128 GiB. = 服务器的RAM是128吉比字节。
Example 2:  The file size exceeds 1 GiB; you need to compress it. = 文件大小超过1吉比字节；你需要压缩它。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "gibibyte".  It's used as a standalone unit of measurement.  Phrases would involve using it within descriptions:

Example 1:  a 256 GiB SSD = 一个256吉比字节的固态硬盘
Example 2:  low GiB usage = 低吉比字节使用量
Example 3:  high GiB storage = 高吉比字节存储
Example 4:  requires 1 GiB minimum = 需要至少1吉比字节
Example 5:  transferring large GiB files = 传输大型吉比字节文件


词源:
The word "gibibyte" is a portmanteau of "gibi" (a binary prefix representing 2<sup>30</sup>) and "byte".  The prefix "gibi" itself is derived from "giga" (meaning 10<sup>9</sup> in the decimal system) and the letter "i" to distinguish it from the decimal "giga" prefix.  This distinction helps clarify the difference between binary and decimal units of data storage.
