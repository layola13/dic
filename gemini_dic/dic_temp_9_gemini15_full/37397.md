词源:
The word "commerced" comes from the Old French word "comerci," meaning "trade, commerce," which in turn derives from the Latin word "commercium," a combination of "com-" (together, with) and "mercium" (merx, merchandise).  It reflects the fundamental social interaction of exchange inherent in trade and commerce.
