词源:

The word "cyclically" is derived from the adjective "cyclic," which in turn comes from the Greek word "kyklos" (κύκλος), meaning "circle" or "cycle."  The suffix "-ly" is an adverbial suffix, indicating manner or way.  Thus, "cyclically" means "in a cyclical manner."


用法说明:


This adverb describes actions or events that happen repeatedly in a cycle or series.  The cycle may be a natural phenomenon (like the seasons) or a process created by humans (like a machine's operation).  The implication is that the events or actions are predictable and follow a repeating pattern.


由于"cyclically"本身是副词，它不具备动词、名词或形容词的属性，因此不适用动词的各种时态变化。  它主要修饰动词，描述动词所表示的动作如何发生。
