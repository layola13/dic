The word "doomin" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of another word.  If you can provide the intended word or context, I can provide an analysis.
* **A neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word or a slang term used within a specific community or context.  More information is needed to understand its meaning and usage.
* **A proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (like a name or place) and not a standard dictionary word.


To help me provide the analysis you need, please clarify the word or provide more context where you encountered it.
