词源:
The word "extendibilities" is derived from the verb "extend," meaning to make longer or greater.  The suffix "-ibility" indicates the capability or quality of being able to be extended.  Therefore, "extendibilities" refers to the inherent qualities or features that allow for extension or expansion.
