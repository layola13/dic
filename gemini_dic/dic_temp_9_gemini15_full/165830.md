词源:

The word "preoccupation" comes from the prefix "pre-", meaning "before" or "in advance," the verb "occupy," meaning "to engage or fill," and the suffix "-ation," which forms nouns. Therefore, "preoccupation" literally means "something that occupies one's mind beforehand or to a significant degree."  The root "occupy" traces back to the Latin "occupare," composed of "ob-" (towards) and "capere" (to seize or take).
