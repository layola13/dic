词源:  The word "enfoldment" is derived from the verb "enfold," which is a combination of the prefix "en-" (meaning "in" or "into") and the verb "fold."  The "-ment" suffix indicates the process or result of the action.  Therefore, "enfoldment" literally means the act or state of being folded in or enveloped.
