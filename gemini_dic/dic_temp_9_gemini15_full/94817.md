词源:

* **im-**:  prefix indicating negation or lack of (as in "impossible," "imperfect").
* **punctual**:  adjective meaning "prompt; on time."  This in turn derives from the Latin word "punctualis," related to "punctum" (point).  The idea is being precisely on the appointed point in time.
* **-ity**: suffix forming nouns of state or quality (as in "ability," "activity").

Therefore, "impunctuality" literally means "the state of not being punctual."
