词源:  The word "dehumanizing" is derived from the prefix "de-", meaning "to remove or deprive," and the word "humanizing," which in turn comes from "human" + "-izing" (a suffix indicating the process of making something human or human-like).  Therefore, "dehumanizing" literally means "to remove the human qualities from something or someone."
