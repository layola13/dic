impedance:/ɪmˈpiːdəns/| n. |阻抗|The opposition to the flow of alternating current in an electrical circuit, comprising resistance and reactance.|The impedance of the circuit was too high, causing the current to be low.|近义词：resistance, reactance|反义词：conductance


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The impedance of this wire is high. = 这根电线的阻抗很高。
What is the impedance of this component? = 这个组件的阻抗是多少？


一般过去时:
The impedance was measured yesterday. = 阻抗昨天被测量了。
The impedance of the circuit was lower than expected. = 电路的阻抗低于预期。


现在完成时:
We have calculated the impedance of the system. = 我们已经计算了系统的阻抗。
Engineers have found ways to reduce impedance in high-frequency circuits. = 工程师们已经找到方法来降低高频电路中的阻抗。


过去完成时:
The impedance had already been determined before the experiment began. = 实验开始前阻抗已经确定了。
They had underestimated the impedance, leading to unexpected results. = 他们低估了阻抗，导致了意想不到的结果。


将来时:
The impedance will be measured tomorrow. = 阻抗将在明天测量。
We will need to adjust the impedance to optimize performance. = 我们需要调整阻抗以优化性能。


虚拟语气:
If the impedance were lower, the signal would be stronger. = 如果阻抗更低，信号就会更强。
It would be better if we could reduce the impedance further. = 如果我们能进一步降低阻抗那就更好了。


被动语态:
The impedance was carefully measured. = 阻抗被仔细测量了。
The impedance is being tested in the laboratory. = 阻抗正在实验室里进行测试。


疑问句:
What is the impedance of this speaker? = 这个扬声器的阻抗是多少？
How can we measure the impedance accurately? = 我们如何精确地测量阻抗？


否定句:
The impedance is not constant. = 阻抗不是恒定的。
The circuit did not show the expected impedance. = 电路没有显示预期的阻抗。


PHRASE->
high impedance = 高阻抗
low impedance = 低阻抗
characteristic impedance = 特性阻抗
input impedance = 输入阻抗
output impedance = 输出阻抗
