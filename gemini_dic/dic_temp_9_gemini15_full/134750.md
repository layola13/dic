词源:

The word "nonmelodious" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "melodious".  "Melodious" comes from the Middle French *melodieux* and ultimately from the Greek *melos* (song, melody) + *ōidēs* (like, resembling).  Therefore, "nonmelodious" literally means "not like a song" or "not having the quality of a pleasant melody".
