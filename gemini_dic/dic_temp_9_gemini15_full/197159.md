词源:
The word "shankier" is derived from the word "shank," meaning the leg, especially the part of the leg below the knee in humans, or the leg of an animal.  The "-ier" suffix is a comparative adjective suffix, indicating a greater degree of the quality described by the root word.  Therefore, "shankier" means "more having the qualities of a shank," leading to its meaning of having thin, bony legs.
