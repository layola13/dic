词源:  The word "candid" comes from the Latin word "candidus," meaning "shining white," "pure," or "innocent."  Over time, its meaning shifted to imply honesty and straightforwardness, often associated with a lack of pretense or artifice.  The connection likely lies in the association of whiteness with purity and truthfulness.
