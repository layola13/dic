词源:  The word is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the noun "sobriety," which derives from the Old French word "sobriete" and ultimately from the Latin word "sobrietas," meaning "temperance," "moderation," or "soberness."  Therefore, "nonsobriety" literally means "not sobriety."
