词源:

The word "delegation's" is derived from the noun "delegation."  "Delegation" comes from the verb "delegate," which originates from the Late Latin word "delegatus," the past participle of "delegare."  "Delegare" is composed of "de-" (away, off) and "legare" (to send, appoint, entrust).  Therefore, the core meaning involves entrusting or assigning a task or responsibility to another. The addition of the possessive apostrophe-s ('s) signifies ownership or association.
