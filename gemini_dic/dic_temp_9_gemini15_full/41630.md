correctibilities: /ˌkɔːrektəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可纠正性；可改正性 | The capacity or potential for being corrected or amended.  It often refers to the degree to which something can be improved or made right.  | Example: The study examined the correctibilities of different types of errors in the software. 这项研究考察了软件中不同类型错误的可纠正性。 | 近义词: amendability, rectifiability, corrigibility | 反义词: incorrigibility, irretrievability
