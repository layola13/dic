Etymology: The word "giraffe" entered English in the 15th century via the French word "girafe".  The French word likely derives from the Arabic word زرافة (zarāfa), which possibly comes from the Somali word *gerafa*, meaning "tall one".  Ultimately, the name may reflect the animal's striking height and appearance.
