词源:
The word "opportunity" comes from the Middle English word "opportuyte," which itself is derived from the Old French word "opoortunite."  This in turn comes from the Late Latin word "opportunitatem," a noun meaning "fitness of time, favorable moment, seasonableness," which is from the adjective "opportunus," meaning "opportune, timely, convenient."  The Latin roots are "ob" (towards) and "portus" (harbor, port).  The original sense related to a favorable time or situation, akin to "arriving at a favorable port."
