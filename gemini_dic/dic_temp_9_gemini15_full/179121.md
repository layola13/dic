The word "redey" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps you could provide more context where you encountered this word.

2. **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word, a word specific to a particular dialect or community, or a slang term.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name or place name.


To provide the analysis you requested, I need a valid English word. Please double-check the spelling or provide more context.
