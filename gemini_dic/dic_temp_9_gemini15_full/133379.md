Word Origin:

The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "extrinsic" (meaning "external" or "coming from outside"). "Extrinsic" itself comes from the Latin word "extrinsicus," which is derived from "extra" (outside) and "intrinsecus" (within).  Therefore, "nonextrinsical" literally means "not from outside," emphasizing an inherent or internal nature.
