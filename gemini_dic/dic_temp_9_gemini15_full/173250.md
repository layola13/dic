quasi-conforming: /ˈkwɑːzaɪ kənˈfɔːrmɪŋ/ | adj. | 准协调的，拟协调的 |  Describes a finite element method where the approximation functions do not exactly satisfy the inter-element continuity requirements of a conforming method, but still achieve sufficient accuracy.  It relaxes the strict conformity conditions, allowing for simpler element formulations while maintaining reasonable accuracy.  This approach is often used to improve computational efficiency or simplify the implementation of specific element types.  | 例句：Quasi-conforming elements are frequently used in the analysis of plate bending problems.  准协调单元经常用于分析板弯曲问题。


The use of quasi-conforming elements can lead to reduced computational cost compared to conforming elements. 使用准协调单元与协调单元相比可以降低计算成本。
