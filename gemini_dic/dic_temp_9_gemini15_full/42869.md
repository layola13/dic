词源:The word "courtierism" is derived from "courtier," meaning a person who attends a royal court.  The suffix "-ism" denotes a system, practice, or characteristic.  Therefore, "courtierism" signifies the system or practice of behaving like a courtier, emphasizing the negative aspects of such behavior.  The word's roots ultimately trace back to Old French "cour," meaning "court," and ultimately to Latin "cor," meaning "heart" or "yard," suggesting the area around a house and eventually evolving to mean a royal court.
