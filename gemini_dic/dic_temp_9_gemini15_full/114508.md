词源:
The word "maladministers" is formed from the prefix "mal-" (meaning bad or ill) and the verb "administers" (meaning to manage or govern).  Therefore, it literally means "to manage or govern badly."  The root "administer" comes from the Latin "administrare,"  a combination of "ad-" (to) and "ministrare" (to serve).
