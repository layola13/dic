USAGE->
There is no verb conjugation for "ceteris paribus" or its shortened form "ceter" as it functions as an adverbial phrase, not a verb.  It modifies the main clause by indicating a condition.  Therefore, grammatical tenses do not apply directly to "ceter."  The tense is determined by the verb in the main clause it modifies.


Example 1 (Present Tense): Ceteris paribus, the price increases with demand. (在其他条件相同的情况下，价格随需求而上涨。)
Example 2 (Past Tense): Ceteris paribus, the price increased with demand last year. (在其他条件相同的情况下，去年价格随需求而上涨。)
Example 3 (Future Tense): Ceteris paribus, the price will increase with demand next year. (在其他条件相同的情况下，明年价格将随需求而上涨。)



PHRASE->
While "ceter" itself doesn't form phrases in the same way a verb or noun might, the complete phrase "ceteris paribus" is used in various contexts, always implying the "all other things being equal" caveat.  It doesn't have common phrasal variations in the way "what" does.  The meaning remains consistent.
