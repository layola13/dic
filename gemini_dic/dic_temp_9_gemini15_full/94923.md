in-loop: /ˌɪnˈluːp/ | adj. | 内循环的，循环内的 |  Referring to something that is within a loop or iterative process.  It often implies being actively involved or participating in the loop's operations.  | Example:  The data was processed in-loop, ensuring real-time analysis. = 数据在循环中处理，确保实时分析。 The in-loop optimization significantly improved the algorithm's efficiency. = 内循环优化显著提高了算法的效率。 | 近义词:  iterative, cyclical, recursive | 反义词:  out-of-loop, external, offline |  adj.


PHRASE->
in the loop =  知情的，参与其中的
keep someone in the loop =  让某人知道最新情况
out of the loop =  不知情的，局外人
bring someone into the loop =  让某人参与进来
loop in =  使某人参与进来


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The program is in-loop processing data. = 程序正在循环处理数据。
This function is in-loop executing calculations. = 此函数正在循环执行计算。


一般过去时:
The algorithm was in-loop during the simulation. = 算法在模拟过程中处于循环状态。
The data was in-loop processed and analyzed. = 数据经过循环处理和分析。


现在完成时:
The system has been in-loop since the start of the operation. = 系统自运行开始就一直处于循环状态。
The process has been in-loop for several hours. = 该过程已经循环运行了几个小时。


过去完成时:
The module had been in-loop before the error occurred. = 错误发生前，模块一直在循环中。
The calculations had been in-loop for a long time before the result was obtained. = 在获得结果之前，计算已经循环运行了很长时间。


将来时:
The software will be in-loop performing the task. = 该软件将处于循环状态执行任务。
The control system will be in-loop monitoring the parameters. = 控制系统将处于循环状态监控参数。


虚拟语气:
If the program were in-loop, the processing would be faster. = 如果程序处于循环状态，处理速度会更快。
I wish the data were in-loop for immediate analysis. = 我希望数据处于循环状态以便立即分析。


被动语态:
The data was in-loop processed by the application. = 数据由应用程序进行循环处理。
The parameters are in-loop monitored by the controller. = 参数由控制器循环监控。


疑问句:
Is the process currently in-loop? = 过程目前是否处于循环状态？
Was the module in-loop during the testing phase? = 在测试阶段，模块是否处于循环状态？


否定句:
The system is not in-loop at the moment. = 系统目前没有处于循环状态。
The data wasn't in-loop processed in that instance. = 在那种情况下，数据没有进行循环处理。
