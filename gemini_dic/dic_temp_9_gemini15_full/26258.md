词源:
The term "button-down" is a compound adjective, combining "button" (referring to the fastening mechanism) and "down" (indicating the action of fastening).  Its origins trace back to the style of shirts popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, featuring collars that were designed to be buttoned down, providing a more formal and neat look compared to open collars.
