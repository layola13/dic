/ˈkɒnfɪks/ /ˈkɑːnfɪks/ | n. | 词缀 | A confix is a type of bound morpheme that is inserted into the middle of a word stem to modify its meaning. Unlike prefixes and suffixes, which are added to the beginning or end of a word, confixes are inserted within the stem. They are less common than prefixes and suffixes in English, but they exist in other languages.  |  While English doesn't have many examples, some linguists consider certain elements in words like "unbreakable" (where "-break-" is arguably the stem and "un-" and "-able" are added to it) as having properties of a confix, although this is debated.  More common examples can be found in other languages, like certain infixes in Tagalog or other Austronesian languages. |  近义词: infix (in some contexts) | 反义词: N/A
