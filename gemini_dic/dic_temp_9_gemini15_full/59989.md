WORD ORIGIN->
The word "edition" comes from the Old French word "edicion," which itself is derived from the Latin word "editionem," the gerundive form of "edere," meaning "to publish" or "to give out."  Therefore, the core meaning relates to the act of preparing and releasing a particular version of a work.
