词源:
The word "racetrack" is a compound word formed from "race" and "track."  "Race" comes from the Old French word "race," meaning "kind, breed, lineage,"  and eventually acquired the sense of a contest of speed. "Track" comes from the Old English word "traec," meaning "a beaten path, way, course."  The combination thus describes a path specifically designed for racing.
