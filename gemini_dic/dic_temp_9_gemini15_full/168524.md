词源:  The word "procacious" derives from the Latin word "procax," meaning "forward," "bold," or "saucy."  The Latin word itself is a combination of "pro-" (forward) and  "-cax" (a suffix related to "capio," meaning "to seize" or "to take").  Thus, the original meaning implies a forwardness or boldness in seizing or taking something.  Over time, the meaning shifted to include sexual connotations.
