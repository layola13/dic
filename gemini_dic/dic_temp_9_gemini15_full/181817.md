词源:
The word "relishable" comes from the verb "relish," meaning to enjoy greatly.  "Relish" itself ultimately derives from the Old French word "relescher," meaning "to lick up," which in turn has roots in the Latin word "re-" (again) and "linguere" (to lick).  Therefore, "relishable" suggests something that is worthy of being savored and enjoyed fully, like licking up something delicious.
