词源:
The word "consequential" originates from the Latin word "consequi," meaning "to follow," "to obtain," or "to achieve."  The prefix "con-" intensifies the meaning.  Over time, it evolved to describe things that follow as a result or consequence, and later, things that are important or significant because of their results.


用法说明:

1.  **Describing Importance:**  This is the most common usage.  It indicates something is important or significant, often because of its effects.

例句：The consequential aspects of the treaty were carefully considered. 条约的重要方面得到了仔细考虑。
