词源:

The word derives from "inquisitor," which itself comes from the Latin word "inquisitor," meaning "investigator" or "examiner."  The suffix "-ially" transforms the noun into an adverb, indicating the manner or way something is done.  The original Latin root is "inquirere," meaning "to seek," "to search," or "to inquire."  The historical context is heavily tied to the medieval Inquisition, a religious court known for its rigorous questioning and investigations.
