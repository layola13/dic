词源:
The word "moggie" is a colloquial and informal term for a cat. Its origin is uncertain, but it's likely a diminutive or affectionate form of a word related to "mog," which may be of uncertain origin, perhaps a dialectal variation.  Some speculate a link to the Old French word "moche," meaning ugly, though this connection is tenuous. Its current usage focuses on its informal and sometimes slightly disparaging nature, though it's rarely meant to be truly offensive.
