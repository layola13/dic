The word "inscribablenesses" is formed by adding "-nesses" (a pluralizing suffix indicating a state or quality) to "inscribable" (meaning "not able to be inscribed or written"). "Inscribable" itself is formed from "inscribe" (to write or engrave) + "able" (capable of).  Therefore,  "inscribablenesses" refers to the multiple aspects or qualities of being impossible to describe or inscribe.
