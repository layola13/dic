词源:
The name "Milo" is likely a shortened version of the word "Milky," reflecting the creamy texture of the drink when mixed with milk.  The brand was created in Australia in the 1930s.  While the exact etymology of the brand name isn't publicly documented, the association with milk and its creamy nature makes a strong case for this hypothesis.
