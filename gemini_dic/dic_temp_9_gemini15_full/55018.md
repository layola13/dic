词源:

The word "dispute" comes from the Old French word "desputer," meaning "to argue, debate, contend."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "disputare," which is a combination of the prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart" or "away") and "putare" (meaning "to think," "to reckon," or "to consider").  Therefore, the original meaning points to a process of thinking or considering something apart or differently, leading to argument or disagreement.
