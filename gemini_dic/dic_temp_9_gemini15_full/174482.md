quinoidine:/ˈkwɪnɔɪdiːn/| n. |奎宁碱|Quinoidine is a mixture of alkaloids found in the bark of the cinchona tree, primarily consisting of quinine and other related compounds. It was historically used as an antimalarial drug, but its inconsistent composition and potential toxicity led to its replacement by purified quinine.|The historical use of quinoidine as an antimalarial is well documented, though now largely superseded by more reliable treatments. |近义词：quinine (though less pure)|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
