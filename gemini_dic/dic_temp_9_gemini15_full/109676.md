leucophyllous: /ˌluːkəˈfɪləs/ | adj. | 白叶的；叶色浅的 | Having pale or whitish leaves.  The term refers to plants with leaves that are lighter in color than typical green foliage, often due to a reduced amount of chlorophyll or other pigments.  This characteristic can be due to various factors, including genetic mutations, environmental stress, or disease.
