词源：

The word is derived from "oracular," which comes from "oracle," ultimately from the Latin "ōrāculum," meaning "a sacred shrine where a deity reveals the future," from "ōrāre," meaning "to speak," "pray," or "utter." The suffix "-ness" forms nouns of quality or state.  Therefore, "oracularnesses" signifies the multiple qualities of being like an oracle—mysterious, prophetic, and ambiguous.
