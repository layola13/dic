homoeostatic: /ˌhoʊmiəˈstætɪk/ | adj. |体内平衡的，稳态的 | Maintaining or relating to homeostasis.  The term describes the ability of a system (biological, chemical, or physical) to maintain a stable internal environment in the face of external changes.  | Example:  The body's homeostatic mechanisms help regulate temperature.  身体的稳态机制有助于调节体温。  | 近义词：homeostatic,  self-regulating | 反义词：unstable, chaotic | 词性：形容词
