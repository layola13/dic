词源:

The word "hyperridiculous" is a compound word.  "Hyper-" is a prefix of Greek origin meaning "over," "beyond," or "excessive."  "Ridiculous" comes from the Late Latin word *ridiculus*, meaning "laughable" or "worthy of laughter."  Therefore, "hyperridiculous" literally means "excessively ridiculous."
