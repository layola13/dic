This word is not a standard English word. It's likely a non-standard plural form of "seeableness," itself an uncommon word.  There's no established etymology or extensive usage information for "seeablenesses" in reputable dictionaries or corpora.  The word is formed by adding the plural suffix "-es" to "seeableness," which is derived from "seeable" (capable of being seen) + "-ness" (a suffix indicating a state or quality).  Therefore, "seeablenesses" attempts to convey multiple instances or aspects of "seeableness".

Because the word is not standard, providing grammatical examples in various tenses would be artificial and misleading.  The word functions similarly to other abstract nouns describing qualities; however, its unusual nature limits its practical application.  One might use it in highly informal settings or creative writing, but it is not suitable for formal academic or professional communication.  A more appropriate term would be "visible aspects," "manifestations," or "noticeable features," depending on the context.
