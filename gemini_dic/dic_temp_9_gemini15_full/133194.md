/nʌnˈɪvəlˌnɪsəz/ | n. |非邪恶行为；善良的行为 |The word "nonevilnesses" is not a standard English word.  It's a neologism, likely formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") and "evilnesses" (the plural of "evilness," meaning wickedness or malice). It aims to describe the absence of evil or the presence of goodness. However, it's awkward and uncommon.  A more natural and understandable way to express this concept would be using phrases like "acts of kindness," "good deeds," "benevolent actions," or "virtuous acts." |例句：The report focused on the nonevilnesses of the suspect, which contradicted earlier testimonies. (报告重点关注了嫌疑人的善良行为，这与之前的证词相矛盾。)  |近义词：good deeds, acts of kindness, benevolent actions, virtuous acts |反义词：evil deeds, wicked acts, malicious acts, villainous acts |名词
