This word does not have verb conjugations like "what" in the example.  It's a noun and thus doesn't follow typical verb tense structures.


PHRASE->
There aren't common set phrases directly using "mallam" as it's a title rather than a verb or common noun in phrases.  Phrases would revolve around the mallam's role, e.g., "advice from the mallam," "the mallam's blessing," etc.
