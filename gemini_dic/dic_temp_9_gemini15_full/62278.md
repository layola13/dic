encystation:/ˌɛnˈsɪsteɪʃən/| n. |包囊形成；包囊化；胞囊形成|The process by which a motile organism, such as a protozoan, becomes enclosed in a protective cyst or capsule.  This process is often triggered by environmental stress such as nutrient deprivation or changes in temperature. |Example: Encystation is a crucial survival strategy for many parasitic protozoa. 包囊形成是许多寄生性原生动物的重要生存策略。|近义词：encapsulation, cyst formation |反义词：excystation


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Encystation occurs when environmental conditions become unfavorable. = 当环境条件变得不利时，就会发生包囊形成。
The parasite undergoes encystation before transmission to a new host. = 寄生虫在传播到新的宿主之前会进行包囊形成。


一般过去时:
Encystation was observed in the laboratory under stress conditions. = 在实验室的应激条件下观察到包囊形成。
The protozoa completed encystation within 24 hours. = 原生动物在24小时内完成了包囊形成。


现在完成时:
The researchers have observed encystation in several different species. = 研究人员已经在几种不同的物种中观察到包囊形成。
Many studies have documented the triggers for encystation in Giardia. = 许多研究已经记录了贾第鞭毛虫包囊形成的诱因。


过去完成时:
The cells had already begun encystation before the experiment started. = 在实验开始之前，细胞就已经开始包囊形成。
The parasite had completed encystation by the time it reached the new host. = 当寄生虫到达新的宿主时，它已经完成了包囊形成。


将来时:
The scientists will induce encystation in the laboratory to study the process. = 科学家们将在实验室中诱导包囊形成以研究这一过程。
We predict that encystation will occur within the next few hours. = 我们预测包囊形成将在接下来的几个小时内发生。


虚拟语气:
If the conditions were right, encystation would occur rapidly. = 如果条件合适，包囊形成会很快发生。
It is important that encystation be completed before exposure to harsh conditions. = 在暴露于恶劣条件之前完成包囊形成非常重要。


被动语态:
Encystation was induced by lowering the temperature. = 通过降低温度诱导包囊形成。
The process of encystation is often studied using microscopy. = 包囊形成的过程通常使用显微镜进行研究。


疑问句:
Does encystation always protect the organism from environmental stress? = 包囊形成是否总是能保护生物体免受环境压力的影响？
What environmental factors trigger encystation in this species? = 在这种物种中，哪些环境因素会引发包囊形成？


否定句:
Encystation did not occur in the control group. = 对照组没有发生包囊形成。
The parasite did not undergo encystation under normal conditions. = 寄生虫在正常条件下不会进行包囊形成。
