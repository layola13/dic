compiler:/kəmˈpaɪlər/| n. |编译器|A compiler is a special program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language (like C++, Java, or Python) into a low-level language (like assembly language or machine code) that a computer can directly understand and execute.  This process is called compilation.  The resulting low-level code is often more efficient than interpreted code.|Example:  The C++ compiler successfully translated the code into an executable file.  C++编译器成功地将代码翻译成了可执行文件。|近义词：translator, interpreter (in a less precise sense)|反义词：interpreter (in a more precise sense, referring to the method of code execution)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The compiler checks for errors in the code. = 编译器检查代码中的错误。
This compiler supports multiple programming languages. = 这个编译器支持多种编程语言。

一般过去时:
The compiler found a syntax error. = 编译器发现了一个语法错误。
The old compiler was slower than the new one. = 旧编译器比新编译器慢。

现在完成时:
The compiler has already finished compiling the code. = 编译器已经完成了代码编译。
They have used this compiler for many years. = 他们已经使用这个编译器很多年了。

过去完成时:
The program had crashed before the compiler could finish. = 在编译器完成编译之前，程序已经崩溃了。
The developer had already debugged the code before running it through the compiler. = 开发人员在通过编译器运行代码之前就已经调试了代码。

将来时:
The new compiler will support parallel processing. = 新的编译器将支持并行处理。
We will use a different compiler for this project. = 我们将为此项目使用不同的编译器。

虚拟语气:
If the compiler detected an error, it would halt compilation. = 如果编译器检测到错误，它将停止编译。
It is essential that the compiler be optimized for speed. = 编译器必须针对速度进行优化。


被动语态:
The code was compiled successfully. = 代码成功编译。
Errors were detected by the compiler. = 错误被编译器检测到。

疑问句:
Which compiler are you using? = 你正在使用哪个编译器？
Does this compiler support debugging? = 这个编译器支持调试吗？

否定句:
The compiler did not find any errors. = 编译器没有发现任何错误。
The code could not be compiled due to a missing library. = 由于缺少库，代码无法编译。


PHRASE->
compiler optimization = 编译器优化
compiler error = 编译器错误
just-in-time compiler = 即时编译器
cross compiler = 交叉编译器
compiler flags = 编译器标志


词源:
The word "compiler" is derived from the verb "compile," which comes from the Latin word "compilare," meaning "to plunder," "to pillage," or "to gather together."  In the context of computing, it evolved to mean "to gather together and combine" different parts of a program into a coherent whole.  The use of "compile" in this sense emerged in the early days of computing when programmers had to manually assemble programs from individual instructions, a tedious and error-prone process.  The compiler automated this process, "gathering" together the source code and "combining" it into an executable.
