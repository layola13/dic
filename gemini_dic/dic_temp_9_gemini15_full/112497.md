词源:  Derived from the verb "lour," meaning to look sullen, threatening, or gloomy.  "Lour" itself comes from Old English *hlūrian,  of uncertain origin, possibly related to words suggesting a frowning or scowling expression.  The "-ingly" suffix transforms the verb into an adverb, indicating the manner in which something happens.
