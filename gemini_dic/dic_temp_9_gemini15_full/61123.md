词源:  The word "eloinment" derives from the Old French word "eloignement," meaning "removal," "distance," or "estrangement."  This, in turn, comes from the verb "eloigner," meaning "to remove" or "to distance."  The ultimate origin is the Latin word "longus," meaning "long," reflecting the sense of distance inherent in the word.
