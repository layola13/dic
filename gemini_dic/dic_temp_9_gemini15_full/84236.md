词源:

The word is a compound of "half" and "shoddy".  "Half" is of Old English origin, meaning "a side, half".  "Shoddy" originates from the early 19th century, deriving from the dialectal English word "shod," meaning "to cover with worn cloth," referring to the practice of recycling old cloth to make new fabric.  This recycled fabric was often of inferior quality, hence the negative connotation of "shoddy".

用法说明:

"Half-shoddy" is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that is only partially of poor quality.  It is not a commonly used word, but it effectively conveys the nuance of something being a mixture of good and bad qualities.  It is more informal than words like "substandard" or "inferior".


例句:
