The word "cima" is not a standard English word.  It's likely from another language, possibly Italian or Spanish, where it means "top" or "summit."  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis in the requested format for an English word that doesn't exist in English.

To provide a helpful response, I need a valid English word.  Please provide a different word for analysis.
