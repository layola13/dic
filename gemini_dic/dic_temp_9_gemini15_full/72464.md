词源:
The word "flunk" likely originated in American English in the late 19th century. Its etymology is uncertain, but it's possibly related to or derived from the German word "flunken," meaning "to fail." Another possible connection is the word "funk," meaning to be afraid or cowardly, implying a lack of preparedness leading to failure.  The exact origin remains debated among etymologists.
