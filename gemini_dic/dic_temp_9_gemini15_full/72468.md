词源:
The word "flunkey" likely originated in the 18th century.  Its etymology is uncertain, but several theories exist. One suggests it's derived from the German word "Flunk," meaning a blunder or mistake, implying someone who makes mistakes out of eagerness to please. Another theory links it to the Dutch word "fluiken," meaning "to swagger" or "to strut," reflecting the ostentatious behavior sometimes associated with sycophants.  A third theory connects it to "flunky," a term for a student assistant, hinting at a subordinate role.  Despite the uncertainty, the common thread is a sense of subservience and often insincere flattery.
