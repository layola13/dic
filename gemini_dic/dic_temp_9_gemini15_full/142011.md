词源:

Organize (动词) + -able (形容词后缀) + -ity (名词后缀)  The word originates from the verb "organize," ultimately derived from the Greek word "organon" (tool, instrument), implying the structured arrangement of parts to create a whole.  The suffix "-able" makes it an adjective meaning "capable of being organized," and "-ity" transforms it into a noun denoting the quality or state of being organizable.
