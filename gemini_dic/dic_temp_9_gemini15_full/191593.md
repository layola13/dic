/skuːlist/ | adj. | 最学校的；最像学校的 |  This word is not a standard English word. It appears to be a nonce word, meaning a word coined for a specific occasion or context and not part of standard vocabulary.  It's likely formed by adding the superlative suffix "-est" to "school," attempting to create a word meaning "most school-like" or "most characteristic of a school." However, this is not grammatically correct or standard usage. There are no established meanings, usage examples, synonyms, or antonyms for "schoolest."  There's no etymology beyond the obvious construction.

例句：There are no standard usage examples as the word is not a real word.  Any example would be fabricated.

近义词：There are no synonyms.

反义词：There are no antonyms.

词性：adj.(非标准英语)
