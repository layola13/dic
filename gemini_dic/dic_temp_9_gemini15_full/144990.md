近义词：hyperactive, overstimulated, excessively active | 反义词：underactive, inactive, dormant


词源:  The word is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or to a greater degree than normal) with the past participle "activated" (from the verb "activate," meaning to make something active).  "Activate" itself comes from the Latin "activāre," meaning "to make active," ultimately deriving from the adjective "activus," meaning "active."
