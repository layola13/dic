metazoan:/ˌmɛtəˈzoʊən/ | n. |多细胞动物 |A metazoan is a multicellular animal, as opposed to a protozoan (a single-celled animal).  Metazoans are characterized by their complex organization, including specialized cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems. They exhibit a wide range of body plans and lifestyles, encompassing all animals except sponges. | Example:  Sponges are considered the most primitive metazoans. 海绵被认为是最原始的多细胞动物。  The study of metazoan evolution reveals fascinating insights into the diversification of life. 对多细胞动物进化研究揭示了生命多样化的迷人见解。 |近义词：multicellular animal |反义词：protozoan
