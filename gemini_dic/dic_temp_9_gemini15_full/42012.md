词源:  The word comes from "costermonger," a person who sells fruit, vegetables, or other goods from a coster (a costermonger's stall or barrow).  "Coster" is believed to derive from "costard," an old word for an apple, suggesting an early association with fruit selling. "monger" means "trader" or "dealer".  Therefore, the word's origins trace back to the practice of street trading, particularly of fruits and vegetables.
