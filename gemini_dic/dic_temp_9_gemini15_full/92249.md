WORD ORIGIN->
The word "hypertropical" is a combination of "hyper-" and "tropical."  "Hyper-" is a prefix of Greek origin meaning "over," "above," "beyond," or "excessive." "Tropical" derives from the Latin word "tropicus," referring to the tropics, the regions around the equator. Therefore, "hypertropical" literally means "excessively tropical" or "beyond tropical."


USAGE->
(Since "hypertropical" is an adjective, it doesn't have verb conjugations like the example word "what.")

EXAMPLE SENTENCES->

Attributive use:
The hypertropical conditions hindered the expedition.  超热带环境阻碍了探险。

Predicative use:

PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases specifically using "hypertropical." The word itself is relatively uncommon and used in a more scientific or descriptive context.  However, it could be used in phrases such as:  "hypertropical weather patterns," "hypertropical rainforest ecosystems," "hypertropical climate zones".
