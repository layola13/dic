词源:
The word "epiphany" ultimately derives from the Greek word ἐπιφάνεια (epiphaneia), meaning "appearance," "manifestation," or "showing forth."  This Greek word is composed of the prefix ἐπί (epi), meaning "upon," "on," or "over," and φαίνεσθαι (phainesthai), meaning "to appear" or "to shine."  In early Christianity, it referred specifically to the manifestation of God in Jesus Christ. Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass any sudden moment of realization or understanding.
