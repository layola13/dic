monosubstitution:/ˌmɒnəʊˌsʌbstiˈtjuːʃən/| n. |单取代；单一取代反应|The replacement of a single atom or group in a molecule with another atom or group.  This process is fundamental in organic chemistry and other fields. For example, the monosubstitution of benzene involves replacing one hydrogen atom on the benzene ring with another atom or group.|例句：The reaction demonstrated a clear preference for monosubstitution over disubstitution.  该反应表明对单取代比双取代有明显的偏好。

例句：Monosubstitution of methane with chlorine yields chloromethane. 甲烷与氯的单取代反应生成氯甲烷。


近义词：single substitution, univalent substitution|反义词：polysubstitution, disubstitution


词源:
mono- :  from Greek *monos* meaning "single," "alone"
substitution: from Latin *substitutus*, past participle of *substituere* meaning "to put in place of," "to substitute."  This itself is composed of *sub-* ("under," "in place of") and *statuere* ("to place," "to set").
