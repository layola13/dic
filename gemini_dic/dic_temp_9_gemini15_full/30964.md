chalaze:/ˈkeɪleɪz/| n. |系带；(蛋的)系带；(果实的)果柄|A chalaza is a structure found in the ovules of flowering plants and the eggs of birds.  In plants, it's the point where the integuments (protective layers) of the ovule fuse with the funiculus (the stalk attaching the ovule to the ovary). In birds' eggs, it's a twisted, cord-like structure of albumin (egg white) that connects the yolk to the shell membranes.  |例句：The chalazae help to keep the yolk centered in the egg.  系带有助于使蛋黄位于蛋的中心。
The chalaza is a crucial part of the ovule's structure. 系带是胚珠结构的关键部分。|近义词：raphe (in plants)|反义词：无|
