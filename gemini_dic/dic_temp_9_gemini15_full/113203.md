词源:  Derived from the verb "lurk," meaning to be or remain hidden so as to attack, ambush, or surprise someone.  The suffix "-ly" transforms the verb into an adverb, modifying the manner of an action.  The root can be traced back to Old English *lurian, of uncertain origin, but possibly related to words meaning "to lie in wait."
