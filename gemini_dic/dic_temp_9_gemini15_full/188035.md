词源:
The word "roughhouse" comes from the combination of "rough" (meaning coarse, violent, or unruly) and "house" (referring to a place of activity or dwelling).  The original meaning likely referred to boisterous behavior within a house or dwelling, evolving to its current more general meaning of boisterous and disorderly conduct.
