multiton:/ˈmʌltɪtɒn/ | n. | 多例模式 | A design pattern in software engineering where only a limited number of instances of a class are created.  It is a variation of the singleton pattern, allowing for more than one instance but still controlling the creation and access to those instances.  This is often used to manage resources or represent limited entities. | Example: A game might use a multiton to manage only three types of weapons, ensuring that no more than three weapon instances exist at any time.  |近义词：limited instantiation pattern, controlled instantiation |反义词：singleton (only one instance)
