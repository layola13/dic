sesquitertial:/ˌsɛskwɪˈtɜːrʃəl/ | adj. | 一千五百分之一的；一百五十分之一的 |  Meaning:  Relating to or denoting a proportion or ratio of 150 to 1 or 1.5 to 0.01.  It combines "sesqui" (one and a half) and "tertial" (one-third). Therefore, it represents 1 1/2 times one-third, which simplifies to 1/2 or 0.5. However, the common usage seems to be misinterpreting it as 150:1.   | Example:  The sesquitertial dilution of the solution is required for the experiment.  (This sentence demonstrates a potential, albeit unconventional, usage. The proper dilution would be expressed more clearly.) | 近义词:  There aren't direct synonyms, as the word is rarely used. One might use "150-fold dilution" or similar phrasing depending on context. | 反义词: There are no direct antonyms.  | 词性: adjective
