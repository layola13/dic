词源:
The word "newfangledly" is derived from "newfangled," which itself is a combination of "new" and "fangled."  "Fangled" comes from the Middle English word "fanglen," meaning "to seize, to catch," but in this context, it evolved to mean "to invent" or "to devise." Therefore, "newfangled" originally meant "newly invented" or "newly devised." The adverbial suffix "-ly" is added to create "newfangledly," modifying verbs and describing how something is done.
