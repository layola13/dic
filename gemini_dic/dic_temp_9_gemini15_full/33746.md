circuitries:/sərˈkɪtriːz/| n. |电路系统；电路网络|The complex circuitries of the computer are essential to its function.  计算机复杂的电路系统对其功能至关重要。|近义词：wiring, networks, systems |反义词：simplicity


The word "circuitries" is the plural form of "circuitry."


Etymology:


The word "circuitry" is derived from "circuit," which comes from the Old French "circuit," meaning "a going round, circle, circumference."  This, in turn, comes from the Latin "circuitus," a combination of "circum" (around) and "ire" (to go).  The "-ry" suffix indicates a collection or system of something.  Therefore, "circuitry" denotes a system or network of circuits.


Usage:


"Circuitries" is used to refer to multiple interconnected electrical circuits or systems.  It emphasizes the complexity and interconnectedness of these circuits, often within a larger device or system.


Example Sentences:


The advanced circuitries in modern smartphones allow for a wide range of functionalities. 现代智能手机中的先进电路系统允许各种各样的功能。

The engineer meticulously examined the circuitries to identify the source of the malfunction. 工程师仔细检查了电路系统以找出故障的根源。


Note: While grammatically correct, "circuitries" is less commonly used than "circuitry."  In most cases, "circuitry" is sufficient and preferred, even when referring to multiple systems.  The use of "circuitries" might be more appropriate when explicitly highlighting the distinct and potentially independent nature of multiple circuit systems within a larger whole.  For example,  "The spacecraft utilizes multiple, independent circuitries for redundancy and safety." (航天器使用多个独立的电路系统以实现冗余和安全。)
