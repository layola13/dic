词源:
The word "halfcut" is a compound word, combining "half" (meaning one of two equal parts) and "cut" (meaning to sever or divide with a sharp instrument).  It emerged as a descriptive term to indicate something that has been partially severed or divided, leaving it incomplete or unfinished.  Its usage reflects a straightforward combination of its constituent parts, with no significant evolution in meaning over time.
