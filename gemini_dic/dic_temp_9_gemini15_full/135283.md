词源:
The word "nonpartiality" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "partiality," which derives from the Old French "partialite" and ultimately from the Latin "partialis" (partial).  Therefore, "nonpartiality" literally means "not partial," or the absence of bias or favoritism.
