词源:
The word "Reichstag" is a compound word from German.  "Reich" means "empire" or "realm," and "Tag" means "day" or "meeting."  Therefore, "Reichstag" literally translates to "empire day" or "imperial diet" (referring to a formal assembly).  The term evolved to refer specifically to the parliament of the German Empire and later, the Weimar Republic.
