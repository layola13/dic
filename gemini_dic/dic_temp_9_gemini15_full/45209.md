词源:
The word "cullibility" is derived from "cullible," meaning easily deceived.  The suffix "-ility" is added to form a noun, signifying the state or quality of being gullible.  The origin of "cullible" itself is uncertain, but it is likely related to the Old French word "credule," meaning "credulous," which in turn stems from the Latin word "credulus," meaning "believing" or "trusting."
