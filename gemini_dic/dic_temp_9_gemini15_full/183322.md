词源:
From Middle French *réprobat, from Latin reprobare ("to disapprove, reject").  The Latin word is derived from re- ("again") + probare ("to test, prove").  Thus, the original sense was to "disprove" or "reject after testing."  Over time, the meaning shifted to focus on the moral failings of the person or thing being rejected.
