词源:
The word "outfielders" is a compound word.  "Outfield" combines "out" (meaning outside or beyond) and "field" (the playing area).  The suffix "-ers" indicates the plural form of the people playing in that area.  Therefore, "outfielders" literally means "those who play in the area outside the infield."
