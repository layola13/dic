词源:
The word "organization" comes from the Old French word "organisation," which itself derives from the Late Latin word "organisatio," meaning "the act of organizing."  The root is the Greek word "organon," meaning "tool" or "instrument," which highlights the idea of parts working together to achieve a common purpose.
