词源:  The word "computerizing" is derived from the noun "computer" and the suffix "-izing," which indicates the process of making something into something else.  "Computer" itself has roots in the Latin word "computare," meaning "to compute" or "to calculate."  The "-izing" suffix is of English origin, related to the verb "to ize," which adds the meaning of "to make" or "to cause to be."  Therefore, "computerizing" literally means "making something use computers."
