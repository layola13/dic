/ˌoʊvər kənˈtraɪtənəsɪz/ | n. | 过度悔恨；悔恨过多 | Excessive expression of remorse or repentance.  The word is not commonly used and may be considered a neologism (newly coined word). It combines "over-" (excessive) with "contriteness" (sincere remorse).  Because of its rarity, finding specific examples in common usage is difficult.  However, one could imagine a sentence such as:  "His overcontritenesses were unconvincing; they seemed more like a performance than genuine regret." | 近义词: excessive remorse, over-apologizing,  profuse apologies | 反义词: lack of remorse, callousness, indifference | 名词
