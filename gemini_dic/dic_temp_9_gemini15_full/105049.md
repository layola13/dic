keratinocytes:/ˌkɛrəˈtɪnəˌsaɪts/| n. |角质形成细胞|Keratinocytes are the major cells of the epidermis, the outermost layer of skin. They produce keratin, a fibrous protein that gives skin its strength and waterproof properties.|例句：The keratinocytes in the epidermis constantly divide and migrate to the skin surface.|近义词：epidermal cells|反义词:N/A
