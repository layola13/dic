词源:

The term "fishtailing" is a descriptive term.  It refers to the way a fish's tail moves from side to side, which is similar to the motion of a vehicle's rear end when it loses traction and slides sideways.  There's no specific etymology tracing it back to a single root word; it's a compound word built on the image of a fish's tail.
