The word "serfish" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., following your requested format.  It may be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure field.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer some assistance.
