词源:  The term likely originated in the mid-20th century, drawing on the image of a low-hanging ball, easily hit, suggesting an easily attainable (and thus low) price.  The exact etymological path is difficult to pinpoint, but the figurative use of "low ball" to represent something cheap or of low value preceded its use as a verb.
