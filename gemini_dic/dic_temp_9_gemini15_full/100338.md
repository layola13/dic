词源:  The word "intersprinkle" is a combination of the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and the verb "sprinkle" (meaning "to scatter small drops or particles").  Therefore, it literally means "to sprinkle between or among."  The word emerged through a natural combining of existing words, rather than having a specific historical etymology like some older words.
