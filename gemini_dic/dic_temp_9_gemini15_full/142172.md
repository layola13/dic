词源:
The word "ormolu" is derived from the French word "or moulu," which literally translates to "ground gold" or "pounded gold."  This refers to the process of creating a gold-colored alloy by grinding and mixing different metals.  While it often looks like solid gold, ormolu is actually a type of gilded bronze.  The term eventually evolved into its current English form.
