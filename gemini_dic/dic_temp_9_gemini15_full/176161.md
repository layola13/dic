This technology is widely used in biotechnology, genetic engineering, and medicine.  It involves isolating DNA segments from one organism and inserting them into the DNA of another organism, often a bacterium or yeast. This allows scientists to study specific genes, produce proteins, and create genetically modified organisms (GMOs).|The scientists used rDNA technology to produce human insulin in bacteria.|近义词：engineered DNA, artificial DNA|反义词：natural DNA, native DNA
