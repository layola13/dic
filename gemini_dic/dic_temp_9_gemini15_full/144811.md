over-head's:  /ˌoʊvərˈhɛdz/ | adj. n. | 经常性开支；管理费用；在头顶上的 | Overhead costs are those that are not directly related to production.  | 高架的，在头顶上的；间接成本 |  High overhead costs can cripple a small business. |  low operating costs, direct costs |  low overhead, direct costs

英文解析:  "Overhead's" is a somewhat unusual form,  as it implies possession by an unspecified entity. It's more accurate to say "overhead costs" or "overhead expenses". Overhead refers to the ongoing expenses of running a business that are not directly tied to production or sales.  These include rent, utilities, salaries of administrative staff, insurance, etc.  It can also refer to something situated above, as in "overhead projector."

例句:

The company's overhead's increased significantly last quarter.  = 公司上季度经常性开支大幅增加。

We need to reduce our overhead's to improve profitability. = 我们需要降低经常性开支以提高盈利能力。


近义词: indirect costs, operating expenses, fixed costs, general and administrative expenses

反义词: direct costs, variable costs, production costs


词性:  Primarily adjective when describing location (above), noun when referring to business expenses.  The possessive form "'s" adds ambiguity.  It's best avoided in formal writing; use "overhead costs" instead.
