由于"quasi-wrong"并非一个标准的英语单词，字典中查不到其定义。  它似乎是一个由"quasi"和"wrong"组合而成的非正式词语，意图表达某种“似是而非的错误”或“部分错误”的概念。  因此，无法按照要求的格式提供完整的词源、用法说明及例句。  以下是一些可能的解释和分析：


**Possible interpretations and analysis of "quasi-wrong":**

* **Meaning:**  The term likely implies something that is almost or partially wrong, but not entirely incorrect.  It might describe an answer, solution, or approach that contains elements of truth but also some inaccuracies or flaws.  It suggests a degree of ambiguity or uncertainty regarding its correctness.

* **Structure:** It's a compound word formed by combining:

    * **quasi- (/ˈkwɑːzaɪ/):**  A prefix meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation to something but not a complete or perfect equivalence.

    * **wrong (/rɒŋ/):** An adjective or noun meaning incorrect, inaccurate, or faulty.


* **Usage:**  Because it's not a standard word, its usage would be highly contextual and informal. You might encounter it in academic discussions, technical writing, or informal conversations where a nuanced description of an error is needed.  However, using a more precise and established term is generally recommended for clarity.

* **Alternatives:** Depending on the context, more appropriate terms might include:

    * **Partially incorrect:**  This is a direct and clear alternative.
    * **Mostly wrong:**  This emphasizes the greater degree of incorrectness.
    * **Inaccurate:** This is a more formal and general term for incorrectness.
    * **Flawed:** This suggests an imperfection or weakness in the approach or solution.
    * **Erroneous:** This is a more formal term for incorrect.
    * **Suboptimal:** This indicates that while not strictly wrong, it's not the best possible solution.


**Example of potential usage (illustrative, not from a dictionary):**

"His solution to the problem was quasi-wrong; while it produced a result, the underlying methodology was flawed and inefficient."


**In summary:** While "quasi-wrong" is understandable from its constituent parts, it lacks formal recognition.  Using more precise vocabulary is generally advisable for better communication.
