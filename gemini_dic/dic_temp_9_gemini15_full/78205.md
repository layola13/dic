gephyrea:/dʒɪˈfɪriə/| n. |棘皮动物门(旧分类)| A now-obsolete taxonomic class of marine invertebrates, formerly considered a class within the phylum Sipuncula, but now understood to be a paraphyletic grouping of several unrelated worm-like animals.  These animals are typically characterized by their elongated, soft bodies, often with a proboscis.  The classification is no longer accepted in modern zoological taxonomy due to its polyphyletic nature.|例句：The classification of gephyrea is outdated and no longer used in modern zoology. = 棘皮动物门的分类已经过时，不再用于现代动物学。|近义词：Sipuncula (partially), Echiura (partially)|反义词：N/A


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a historical context within zoological literature.  Therefore, tense conjugations are not applicable in the same way as with common verbs. The word itself functions as a noun and wouldn't be conjugated.  Instead, we can look at how it's used in a sentence with different verb tenses.

Past Tense Example:
Scientists once believed gephyrea were a unified group. = 科学家曾经认为棘皮动物是一个统一的群体。

Present Tense Example:
Modern taxonomy rejects the classification of gephyrea. = 现代分类学否定了棘皮动物门的分类。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "gephyrea". The term is highly specific to a now-obsolete taxonomic classification.
