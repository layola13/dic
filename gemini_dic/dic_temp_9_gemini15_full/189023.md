词源:
The word "sabbatical" ultimately derives from the Hebrew word "shabbat" (שַׁבָּת), meaning "rest" or "sabbath."  The sabbatical year in the Hebrew Bible prescribed a year of rest for the land every seven years, and this concept was later extended to periods of rest for individuals, particularly scholars and academics.  The word entered English through Latin and ultimately reflects this biblical origin.
