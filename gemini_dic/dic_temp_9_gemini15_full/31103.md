词源:
The word "championship" comes from the word "champion," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "champion," meaning "battlefield," "plain," or "level ground."  This evolved to mean a "combatant" or "fighter," and then to its modern meaning of a winner of a contest.  The suffix "-ship" indicates status, condition, or skill.  Therefore, "championship" denotes the status or condition of being a champion, or the contest itself which determines the champion.
