The word "precorrectly" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism (a newly coined word) or a misspelling.  There's no established pronunciation, meaning, usage, synonyms, or antonyms.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need a correctly spelled word or a clarification of the intended meaning.
