pseudoanaemic: /ˌsuːdəʊəˈniːmɪk/ | adj. | 假性贫血的 | Apparently anemic; resembling anemia in symptoms but not due to a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin.  This condition often presents with symptoms similar to true anemia, such as fatigue, weakness, and pallor, but blood tests reveal normal or near-normal red blood cell counts and hemoglobin levels. The cause may be due to various factors, including nutritional deficiencies that don't directly affect red blood cell production, certain medical conditions, or even psychological factors. | Example:  The patient presented with symptoms of fatigue and pallor, leading to initial suspicion of anemia; however, further testing revealed a pseudoanaemic condition. = 病人出现疲劳和苍白的症状，最初怀疑是贫血；然而，进一步的检查显示是一种假性贫血。  The doctor ruled out true anemia and diagnosed the patient with pseudoanaemia due to iron malabsorption. = 医生排除了真正的贫血，并诊断病人为由于铁吸收不良引起的假性贫血。 | 近义词:  (No direct perfect synonym, as it describes a specific type of condition)  | 反义词:  true anemia,  erythrocytosis (increased red blood cells) | 词性: adjective
