pyrrhotine:/ˈpɪrəʊtaɪn/| n. |黄铁矿; 磁黄铁矿|A mineral consisting of iron sulfide (FeS), often containing nickel. It is usually brassy yellow to bronze in color, and is often found in hydrothermal veins and metamorphic rocks. Pyrrhotite is a common accessory mineral in many ore deposits, and is sometimes associated with other sulfide minerals such as chalcopyrite and galena.|The pyrrhotite sample showed significant nickel content.|近义词：magnetic pyrites|反义词：无
