词源:  From the verb "pay" + the suffix "-er" (agent noun suffix, indicating a person who performs the action). The word "pay" itself has Old French origins (payer), ultimately deriving from Latin "pacare" (to pacify, appease; to make amends, satisfy).  The "-er" suffix is a common English derivation forming agent nouns.
