词源:

The word "hyperpatriotism" is a modern coinage.  It's a compound word formed from:

* **hyper-**:  A prefix meaning "excessive," "above," or "beyond."  It originates from Greek ὑπέρ (hupér), meaning "over," "above," or "beyond."

* **patriotism**:  The love of or devotion to one's country. This comes from the French word "patriotisme" and ultimately from Latin "patriota," meaning "fellow countryman," from "patria," meaning "fatherland."
