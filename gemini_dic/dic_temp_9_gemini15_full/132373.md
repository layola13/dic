/ˌnɒnˌdɪˈlɪriəsnɪsəz/ | n. |非谵妄状态 |The absence of delirium; a state of being free from delirium.  This word is extremely rare and largely theoretical, formed by adding the prefix "non-" to the noun "deliriousnesses".  It describes the opposite of experiencing delirium, which is a state of confusion and disorientation.  There are no readily available examples in common usage due to its rarity and unusual construction.  A more common way to express the concept would be to say "absence of delirium," "lucidity," or "clear-headedness." |近义词：lucidity, clear-headedness, rationality |反义词：delirium, confusion, disorientation
