词源:

The word comes from the noun "compartment," which entered English in the 17th century from French "compartement."  The French word is derived from the verb "compartir," meaning "to share, divide," ultimately tracing back to Latin "compartir," a compound of "cum" ("with") and "partire" ("to divide").  Thus, "compartmented" literally means "divided into shared parts."
