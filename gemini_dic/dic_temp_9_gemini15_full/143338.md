The word "outequivocating" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It seems to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  However, we can speculate on its potential meaning and construction based on the constituent parts:

* **"Out"**:  This prefix often implies "to a great extent," "completely," or "beyond."

* **"equivocate"**: This is a standard English verb meaning "to use ambiguous language so as to conceal the truth or avoid committing oneself."  /ɪˈkwɪvəkeɪt/ | v. |含糊其辞；支吾其词 | To use ambiguous language so as to conceal the truth or avoid committing oneself.  | He equivocated when questioned about his involvement in the scandal. 他在被问及参与丑闻时支吾其辞。 |近义词: prevaricate, hedge, obfuscate | 反义词: clarify, state clearly


If we combine these, "outequivocating" could hypothetically mean:

* **Completely avoiding ambiguity; being completely clear and unambiguous.**  This is the opposite of the meaning of "equivocate."

* **Exceeding the bounds of ambiguity; going beyond equivocation.**  This suggests a level of clarity that is unusually emphatic.


However, without a context or confirmation of its existence,  any analysis would be purely speculative.  The word should be treated as non-standard English.
