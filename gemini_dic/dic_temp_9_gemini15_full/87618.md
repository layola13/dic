heulandite:/ˈhjuːləndaɪt/| n. |方沸石|Heulandite is a group of tectosilicate minerals.  They are hydrous calcium, sodium, and potassium aluminosilicates.  They are found in cavities in volcanic rocks and sometimes in metamorphic rocks. Heulandites are typically white, colorless, or pale shades of yellow, brown, red, or pink. They are known for their pearly luster and distinct crystal habits, often forming tabular or sheaf-like aggregates.|The geologist identified the mineral sample as heulandite.|近义词：clinoptilolite, stilbite|反义词：无
