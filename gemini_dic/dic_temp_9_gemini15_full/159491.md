The word "poline" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please double-check the spelling.  Perhaps it's a proper noun (a name, place, etc.) or a technical term from a specific field.

2. **It's a neologism or slang:**  New words are constantly being coined.  If this is the case, more context is needed to understand its meaning and usage.  Where did you encounter this word?

3. **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.  If you can provide the language of origin, it might be possible to provide a translation and explanation.
