The word "oundy" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific dialect, or a proper noun.  To provide the requested analysis, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered "oundy."
