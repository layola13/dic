phosphines:/ˈfɒsfiːnz/ | n. |膦类化合物 |Phosphines are organophosphorus compounds with the general formula PR3, where R represents an organic substituent such as alkyl or aryl groups. They are analogous to amines (NR3) but with phosphorus replacing nitrogen.  Phosphines are used in various applications, including as ligands in homogeneous catalysis and as reagents in organic synthesis. |例句：Tertiary phosphines are widely used as ligands in transition metal catalysis.  叔膦广泛用作过渡金属催化中的配体。|近义词：organophosphorus compounds |反义词：N/A
