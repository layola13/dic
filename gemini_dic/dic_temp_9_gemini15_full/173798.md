quasi-physically: /ˈkwɑːzaɪ fɪzɪkəli/ | adj. | 准物理的；似物理的 |  Describes something that has characteristics similar to physical phenomena but isn't strictly physical in nature. It often implies an analogy or approximation to physical processes.  |  The simulation, while not perfectly accurate, provides a quasi-physical representation of the particle interactions.  |近义词：near-physical, semi-physical, virtually physical | 反义词：purely abstract, entirely non-physical |


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The model provides a quasi-physical representation of the system. = 模型提供了系统的准物理表示。
This simulation behaves quasi-physically under certain conditions. = 在某些条件下，此模拟表现出准物理特性。


一般过去时:
The experiment demonstrated quasi-physical behavior. = 实验展示了准物理行为。
The researchers observed quasi-physical effects in their study. = 研究人员在他们的研究中观察到准物理效应。


现在完成时:
Scientists have developed several quasi-physical models of the phenomenon. = 科学家已经开发了几种该现象的准物理模型。
Researchers have observed quasi-physical interactions in the experiment. = 研究人员在实验中观察到准物理相互作用。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery,  the theory had only offered quasi-physical explanations. = 在发现之前，该理论只提供了准物理解释。
They had anticipated quasi-physical results, but the reality was different. = 他们曾预料到准物理的结果，但现实却不同。


将来时:
Future research will explore the implications of quasi-physical interactions. = 未来的研究将探索准物理相互作用的意义。
We will likely see more applications of quasi-physical modeling in the future. = 我们将来可能会看到准物理建模的更多应用。


虚拟语气:
If the model were perfectly accurate, it wouldn't be a quasi-physical representation. = 如果模型完全准确，它就不会是准物理表示。
It would be helpful if we had a better understanding of the quasi-physical processes involved. = 如果我们对所涉及的准物理过程有更好的理解，那将会有所帮助。


被动语态:
Quasi-physical effects were observed in the high-energy collisions. = 在高能碰撞中观察到准物理效应。
The quasi-physical nature of the model was confirmed by further experiments. = 模型的准物理性质通过进一步的实验得到了证实。


疑问句:
Is this simulation truly quasi-physical or just an approximation? = 此模拟是真正的准物理还是仅仅是近似值？
Are there other systems that exhibit similar quasi-physical properties? = 是否还有其他系统表现出类似的准物理特性？


否定句:
The results were not entirely quasi-physical; some aspects were purely theoretical. = 结果并非完全是准物理的；某些方面纯粹是理论性的。
The model doesn't accurately capture all the quasi-physical effects. = 该模型并未准确捕捉所有准物理效应。


PHRASE->
