USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations or other grammatical forms like the example word "what".  Therefore, tense (past, present, future etc.), voice (active, passive), or mood (indicative, subjunctive) are not applicable.  The primary usage is as a descriptor in geology or mineralogy.

Example sentences demonstrating usage:

1.  The sample contained a significant amount of cervantite. 样本含有大量的褐铁矿。

2.  Analysis revealed the presence of cervantite and other antimony minerals. 分析显示存在褐铁矿和其他锑矿物。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "cervantite" as it's a highly specific geological term.  Phrases involving related terms such as "antimony ore" or "mineral deposits" would be more common in geological contexts.
