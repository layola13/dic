The word "nascal" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a complete etymology, usage, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  It's likely a misspelling, a regionalism, or a word from a specific dialect or jargon.  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more informed guess.
