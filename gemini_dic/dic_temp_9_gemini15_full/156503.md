词源:The word "picayune" originates from the Spanish word "picayún," which itself comes from the Carib word "picayune."  The Spanish word referred to a small Spanish coin, the eighth of a real, of little value.  This association with a small, insignificant coin led to the word's adoption in English to describe things of little worth or importance, and later, to describe someone who is stingy or mean.
