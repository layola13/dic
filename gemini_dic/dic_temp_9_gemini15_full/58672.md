词源:  The word "dummy" comes from the Middle English word "dummie," meaning "mute person,"  ultimately deriving from the Old French word "dombe,"  meaning "dumb, mute."  The sense of "stupid person" developed later. The use of "dummy" to refer to a model or imitation object also arose, likely due to the idea of something being a "silent substitute."  The use as a beginner's guide is a more recent development.
