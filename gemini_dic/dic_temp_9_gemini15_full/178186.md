recombination's:/ˌriːkɒmbɪˈneɪʃənz/ | n. | 重组；基因重组 | The process of combining different elements or genes to create something new.  It refers to the rearrangement of genetic material, especially by crossing over in chromosomes or by the artificial joining of segments of DNA from different organisms. | Example: The high rate of recombination's in this species leads to rapid evolution.  这个物种的高重组率导致了快速的进化。 The study focused on the recombination's of different viral strains. 这项研究关注不同病毒株的重组。 |近义词:reorganization, restructuring, rearrangement |反义词:separation, division
