词源:
The word "greedily" is derived from the adjective "greedy," which itself comes from the Middle English word "gredi," meaning "voracious," "eager," or "hungry." This, in turn, is related to the Old English word "grēdig," which also had the meaning of "greedy." The suffix "-ly" is added to create the adverbial form.  The root is likely connected to Proto-Germanic roots related to grasping or seizing.
