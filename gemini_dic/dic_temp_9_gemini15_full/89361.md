It's often used in neuroscience to illustrate the disproportionate cortical representation of different body parts.  For example, the hands and face are disproportionately large because of the significant amount of brain area dedicated to their fine motor control and sensory input.| 例句：The sensory homunculus shows that the lips and fingers have a disproportionately large representation in the brain.  感觉皮质小人图显示嘴唇和手指在大脑中占据了不成比例的大片区域。The motor homunculus depicts how much of the motor cortex is dedicated to controlling different parts of the body. 运动皮质小人图描绘了运动皮层有多少区域致力于控制身体的不同部位。|近义词：miniature, pygmy, dwarf|反义词：giant, colossus|名词
