词源:

The word derives from the adjective "litigious," which in turn comes from the Latin word "litigiosus," meaning "quarrelsome," "contentious," or "given to litigation."  The suffix "-ness" is added to form the noun, indicating a state or quality.  The plural "-es" is added to show more than one instance of this quality.


用法说明:

Litigiousnesses is a relatively uncommon word, often used in formal contexts to describe a characteristic of an individual, organization, or even a society.  It emphasizes the repeated and sometimes excessive nature of legal actions.  It's more descriptive than simply saying someone is "litigious."  The word is typically used in a critical or negative sense, highlighting the problematic aspect of excessive legal action.
