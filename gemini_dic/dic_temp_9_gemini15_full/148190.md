词源:
The word "overshadowing" comes from the verb "overshadow," which is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "above" or "beyond") and the noun "shadow."  The original meaning referred to literally casting a shadow over something, but it evolved to encompass the figurative sense of making something less important or noticeable.
