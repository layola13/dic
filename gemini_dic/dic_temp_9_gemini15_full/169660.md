词源:
From Middle English *proporcional, from Old French proporcional, from Latin proportionalis, from proportio ("proportion").  The Latin word *proportio is a combination of *pro ("for," "in front of") and *portio ("part," "portion").  Thus, the word ultimately derives from the idea of parts related to a whole.
