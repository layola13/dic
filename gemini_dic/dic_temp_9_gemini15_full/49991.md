词源:
The word "denizen" comes from the Old French word "dezaine," meaning "tenant" or "inhabitant."  This, in turn, is related to the Latin word "de-," meaning "of," and "tenere," meaning "to hold."  The original sense implied someone who held a dwelling or tenure in a place. Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass any inhabitant or resident.
