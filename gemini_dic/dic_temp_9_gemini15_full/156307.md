/fɪˈseɪli.aɪ/| n. |僧帽水母；葡萄牙战舰 |The word "physaliae" is the plural of "physalia," referring to the Portuguese man o' war, a siphonophore, not a jellyfish as is commonly believed.  It is a colonial organism composed of many specialized individual polyps that work together as a single unit.  The most visible part is a gas-filled bladder, or pneumatophore, which floats on the surface of the water and acts as a sail.  Beneath the surface are long tentacles armed with stinging nematocysts, used to paralyze prey such as small fish and crustaceans. These stings can be extremely painful to humans. | The physaliae were abundant near the shore.  僧帽水母在海岸附近很多。|  Siphonophore, jellyfish | harmless creatures (in comparison) |  noun
