词源：
The word is a combination of "quasi," meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent," and "personal," relating to a person or their characteristics.  "Quasi" derives from Latin *quasi, meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost."  The combination creates a word that describes something that possesses some, but not all, of the qualities of something personal.
