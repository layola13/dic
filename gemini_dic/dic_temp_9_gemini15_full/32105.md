The word "chestier" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Perhaps you could provide more context where you encountered this word.

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into standard English.  If you can provide the language of origin, it might be possible to provide a translation and explanation.


Without more information, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible. Please provide context or clarify the spelling.
