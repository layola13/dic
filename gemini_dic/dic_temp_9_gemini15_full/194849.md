词源：

The word is a combination of "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partially") and "barbarian."  "Barbarian" originates from the Ancient Greek word "βάρβαρος" (barbaros), which was used to describe foreigners whose languages sounded like "bar-bar" to the Greeks.  Initially, it was a neutral term, but it later acquired negative connotations, implying a lack of civilization and refinement.  The term "semi-barbarian" thus reflects a state in between complete savagery and full civilization.
