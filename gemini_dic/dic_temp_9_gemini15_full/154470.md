词源:
The word "peronate" is relatively rare and doesn't have a widely documented etymology.  It's likely a back-formation or a less common variant related to words like "personate" (to imitate or act the part of someone else), which itself derives from "persona" (a theatrical mask, a character)  from Latin.  The "-ate" suffix indicates an action or process.
