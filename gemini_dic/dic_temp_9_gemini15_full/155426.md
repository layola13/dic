phellogen:/ˈfɛlədʒən/| n. |木栓形成层|The phellogen is a meristematic tissue in plants that produces the periderm, which replaces the epidermis during secondary growth.  It is responsible for the formation of cork cells (protective outer layer), phelloderm (inner layer of cells), and sometimes other cell types.  Phellogen is crucial for plant protection against injury, desiccation, and pathogens.|例句：The phellogen activity was significantly increased after wounding, leading to faster wound healing.|近义词：cork cambium|反义词:|词性:名词
