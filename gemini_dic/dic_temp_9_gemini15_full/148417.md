oversteadily: /ˌoʊvərˈstedɪli/ | adv. | 过于稳定地；过度稳定地 |  The word "oversteadily" is not a standard English word. It's a combination of the adverb "steadily" and the prefix "over-," suggesting an excessive or undue degree of steadiness.  It implies a rigidity or lack of flexibility that is undesirable.  There is no established dictionary definition or common usage.  Therefore, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage in the standard format is not possible.  The word would likely be understood in context, but its meaning would be inferred rather than directly defined.
