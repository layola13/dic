semitangent: /ˈsɛmiˌtændʒənt/ | n. | 半正切线 | A line that intersects a curve at a point and is nearly tangent to the curve at that point; it is also a line intersecting a curve at two points infinitely close together.  It's a concept primarily used in advanced mathematics, particularly in geometry and calculus.  The term is less common than "tangent." | Example:  The semitangent to the curve at point P showed a close approximation of the tangent.  = 在P点处曲线半正切线显示出与切线的近似值。 | 近义词：near tangent, approximate tangent | 反义词：normal (perpendicular to tangent) |  名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in mathematical contexts and doesn't lend itself to common grammatical tenses like "present simple," "past simple," etc.  Its usage is descriptive within mathematical proofs or explanations.  There are no typical examples showing verb conjugation.  Instead, illustrative examples in mathematical contexts are provided below:


Example 1 (Descriptive use in a mathematical context):
"The semitangent at this point provides a useful approximation for further calculations." = 在这一点上，半正切线为进一步的计算提供了有用的近似值。

Example 2 (Descriptive use within a proof):
"By considering the semitangent, we can demonstrate the convergence of the sequence." = 通过考虑半正切线，我们可以证明该序列的收敛性。
