词源:

* **non-**:  prefix meaning "not"
* **apologetic**: derived from the word "apology," ultimately from the Greek word "apologia" (απολογία), meaning "defense," "explanation," or "excuse."  The "-tic" suffix turns the noun into an adjective.


Therefore, "non-apologetic" literally means "not apologetic" or "not expressing apology."
