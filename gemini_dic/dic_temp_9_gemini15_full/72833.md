词源:

The word "folio" comes from the Latin word "folium," meaning "leaf."  This is because originally, a folio referred to a single sheet of paper in a manuscript.  Over time, the meaning broadened to include the book format created by folding such sheets, and later, to the collections and ledgers mentioned above.
