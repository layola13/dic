The word "outraye" does not exist in modern English.  It's likely a misspelling or a word from an archaic or very specialized dialect.  There's no entry for it in standard dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  To help you, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered this word.
