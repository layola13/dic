词源：
The word "concerto" comes from the Italian word "concertare," meaning "to contend," "to compete," or "to agree."  This reflects the early use of the form, where soloists might "compete" or "contend" with each other, or where multiple instruments might "agree" in a harmonious interplay.  The word evolved through various stages of Italian and ultimately entered English in its current form.
