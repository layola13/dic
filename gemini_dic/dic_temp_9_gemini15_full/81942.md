词源:
The word "grimbold" appears to be a relatively modern coinage, a blend of "grim" (meaning stern, forbidding) and "bold" (meaning brave, audacious). The combination creates a paradoxical effect, suggesting a severity that is also somehow defiant or imposing.  There's no established etymology tracing it to older roots.
