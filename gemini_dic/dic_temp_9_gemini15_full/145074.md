词源:
The word "overanalyzing" is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the verb "analyzing," which comes from the noun "analysis" (from Greek "analusis," meaning "resolution," "unfolding").  Therefore, "overanalyzing" literally means analyzing something to an excessive degree.
