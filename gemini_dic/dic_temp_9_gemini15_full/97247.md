词源：

* **in-:**  prefix meaning "not" or "without"
* **flex-:** from Latin *flectere*, meaning "to bend"
* **-ible:** suffix meaning "capable of" or "able to be"

Therefore, "inflexible" literally means "not able to be bent" or "unbending".  The meaning has expanded to include the inability to change one's mind or adapt to new situations.
