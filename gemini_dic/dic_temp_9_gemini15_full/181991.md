词源:
The word "rematriculate" is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") and the verb "matriculate," which originally meant "to be enrolled in a university or college," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "matrix" (meaning "womb" or "source").  Thus, rematriculate literally means "to be enrolled again."
