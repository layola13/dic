periastron:/ˌpɛriˈæstrɒn/| n. |拱点，近拱点 |The point in its orbit at which a celestial body is nearest to the body it is orbiting.  It is the closest point in the elliptical orbit of a celestial body around another celestial body. For example, the periastron of a binary star system is the point at which the two stars are closest together. | Example: The periastron passage of the binary star system was observed by astronomers. 天文学家观测到了这颗双星系统的近拱点通过。|近义词：perihelion (for sun), perigee (for Earth) |反义词：apastron


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The periastron of this binary star system occurs every 10 years. = 这个双星系统的近拱点每10年出现一次。
Astronomers are studying the periastron effect on the stars' behavior. = 天文学家正在研究近拱点对恒星行为的影响。


一般过去时:
The periastron passage was observed last year. = 近拱点通过是在去年观测到的。
Scientists calculated the exact time of the periastron. = 科学家计算出了近拱点的精确时间。


现在完成时:
Astronomers have observed many periastron passages of this binary system. = 天文学家已经观测到这个双星系统的许多近拱点通过。
They have determined the periastron's position with high accuracy. = 他们已经高精度地确定了近拱点的方位。


过去完成时:
Before the periastron passage, the stars were farther apart. = 在近拱点通过之前，恒星彼此距离较远。
They had already predicted the time of the periastron before the observation. = 他们在观测之前就已经预测了近拱点的时间。


将来时:
The next periastron will occur in five years. = 下一次近拱点将在五年后出现。
Scientists will monitor the system closely during the next periastron. = 科学家将在下一次近拱点期间密切监测该系统。


虚拟语气:
If the periastron were closer, the stars would interact more strongly. = 如果近拱点更近，恒星的相互作用就会更强烈。
We wish we had better data about the previous periastron. = 我们希望我们有关于上一次近拱点的更好数据。


被动语态:
The periastron passage was accurately predicted by the model. = 近拱点通过被模型准确地预测到。
The effects of the periastron are currently being studied. = 近拱点的效应目前正在被研究。


疑问句:
When will the next periastron occur? = 下一次近拱点将在何时出现？
What are the observable effects of the periastron? = 近拱点的可观测效应是什么？


否定句:
The periastron did not occur exactly as predicted. = 近拱点并未完全按照预测出现。
They did not observe any unusual behavior during the periastron. = 他们在近拱点期间没有观察到任何异常行为。


PHRASE->
periastron advance: 近拱点进动
periastron precession: 近拱点岁差
periastron passage: 近拱点通过
periastron distance: 近拱点距离
periastron time: 近拱点时间
