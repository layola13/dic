词源:
The word "hammy" originates from the theatrical term "ham," meaning a mediocre or unskilled actor who relies on exaggerated gestures and expressions.  The term's origin is uncertain but possibly related to the idea of an actor "ham-fistedly" overacting, or perhaps referencing the fact that actors sometimes use ham as a prop.  The "-y" suffix transforms the noun "ham" into an adjective, describing something possessing the qualities of ham acting.
