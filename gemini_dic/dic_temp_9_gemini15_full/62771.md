The word "engrasp" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's not possible to provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  It might be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or outdated lexicon.  If you could provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer some suggestions on what it could mean or what the intended word might be.
