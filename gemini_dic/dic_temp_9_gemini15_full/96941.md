词源:

The word "inextricabilities" is derived from the word "inextricable," which itself comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "extricable" (meaning "able to be disentangled or freed").  "Extricable" ultimately traces back to the Latin verb "extricare," meaning "to disentangle."  Therefore, "inextricabilities" refers to the qualities or states of being impossible to disentangle or resolve.
