词源:
From *flowery* (adj.) + *-ly (suffix)  The word "flowery" itself derives from "flower" + "-y" (adjective suffix), indicating an abundance or quality associated with flowers (often their colorful and elaborate nature).  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective "flowery" into an adverb, modifying verbs and describing how an action is performed.
