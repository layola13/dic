Etymology:  The word "gambit" originates from the Old French word "gambit," which itself is derived from the Italian word "gambetto," meaning "a tripping up," "a stumbling block," or "a trick."  This reflects the inherent risk and cunning involved in a gambit.  The Italian word ultimately comes from the Old Italian "gamba," meaning "leg," suggesting the idea of tripping someone up by catching their leg.
