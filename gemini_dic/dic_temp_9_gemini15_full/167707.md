词源:
The word "priest" comes from the Old French *prêtre*, which ultimately derives from the Late Latin *presbyter*, meaning "elder." This Latin word itself comes from the Greek *πρεσβύτερος* (*presbyteros*), which also means "elder" or "senior."  The original meaning referred to an elder in the early Christian church, who held a position of authority and responsibility. Over time, the term evolved to specifically denote those ordained for religious duties.
