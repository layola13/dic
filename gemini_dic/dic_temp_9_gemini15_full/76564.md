词源:  The word "galley" ultimately derives from the Medieval Latin *galea, meaning "warship," specifically a type of long, narrow ship used by the Romans and others.  These ships often had their kitchens located in a long, narrow space, hence the association of the word with kitchens.  The printing-related sense also developed due to the long, narrow tables used in printing workshops.
