The word "disprince" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or fictional context.
