词源：

The word "resipiscence" comes from the Latin word "resipiscentia," which is a noun formed from the verb "resipiscere."  "Resipiscere" itself is a compound of "re-" (again) and "sapere" (to taste, to be wise, to understand). Therefore, the original meaning points to a regaining of wisdom or understanding, often in the context of recognizing past errors.  The evolution of the word reflects a shift in emphasis from the regaining of wisdom to the resulting remorse and change of behavior.
