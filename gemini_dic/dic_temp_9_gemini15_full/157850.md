WORD ORIGIN->

The word "plague" comes from the Old French word "plage," which means "wound," "sore," or "ulcer."  It ultimately derives from the Latin word "plaga," which has similar meanings.  The connection to disease arises from the visible sores and boils associated with many infectious diseases. The meaning broadened over time to encompass any widespread affliction or problem.
