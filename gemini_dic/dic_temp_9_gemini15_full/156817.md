词源:
The verb "pig out" is a relatively recent colloquialism.  It's a figurative expression comparing the act of excessive eating to the way pigs consume food greedily. The "pig" part refers to the animal's known voracious appetite, and "out" intensifies the action, suggesting a complete and unrestrained indulgence.  Its origin is unclear, but it likely emerged in the mid-20th century.
