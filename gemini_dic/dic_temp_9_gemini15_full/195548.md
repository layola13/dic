WORD ORIGIN->

* **semi-:**  From Latin "semi-", meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."

* **philosophically:** From "philosophy," ultimately from Greek "philosophia," literally meaning "love of wisdom."  "-ically" is an adverbial suffix.

Therefore, "semiphilosophically" combines the partial nature of "semi-" with the philosophical approach indicated by "-philosophically."
