The word is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "lugubrious."  "Lugubrious" itself originates from the Latin word "lugubris," meaning "mournful" or "sad."  The Latin word is related to "lugeo," meaning "I mourn" or "I lament."

It is less common than its antonym, "lugubrious," but serves as a useful word to express the opposite of somberness.
