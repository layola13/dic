The word "guing" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a word from a very niche context (e.g., slang, dialect, or a proper noun).  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  To get a proper analysis, please provide the correct spelling of the word you intend.
