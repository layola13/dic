The word "premises" does not follow the requested format because it is a noun, not a verb, adjective, or interjection; therefore, many of the grammatical categories are inapplicable.


/ˈprɛmɪsɪz/ | n. | 房屋，建筑物；场所；前提 | Premises refers to a building and its surrounding land, or a house or building and its grounds. It can also refer to a statement or proposition from which another is inferred or follows as a conclusion.  | The company's premises are located downtown.  这家公司的办公地点在市中心。 The premises of his argument are flawed. 他的论证前提有缺陷。 | buildings, grounds, property |  (no direct antonym, but "conclusion" could be considered an antonymic concept in the context of logical arguments) | noun
