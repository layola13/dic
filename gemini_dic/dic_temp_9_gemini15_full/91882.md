hyperintense:/ˌhaɪpərɪnˈtɛns/| adj.|高信号强度|Having abnormally high intensity on an image, particularly in medical imaging such as MRI or CT scans.  This usually indicates a difference in tissue composition or fluid content.|The MRI showed a hyperintense lesion in the brain.|近义词：bright, high-intensity|反义词：hypointense


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The lesion appears hyperintense on the MRI. = 病灶在 MRI 上显示为高信号强度。
This area is hyperintense compared to surrounding tissue. = 与周围组织相比，该区域信号强度较高。


一般过去时:
The scan showed the tumor was hyperintense. = 扫描显示肿瘤为高信号强度。
The lesion appeared hyperintense in the previous MRI. = 在之前的 MRI 中，病灶显示为高信号强度。


现在完成时:
The researchers have found that the substance appears hyperintense on the scans. = 研究人员发现该物质在扫描中显示为高信号强度。
Several studies have shown hyperintense areas in the brain associated with this disease. = 多项研究表明，大脑中与这种疾病相关的区域显示为高信号强度。


过去完成时:
The doctor had already noted the hyperintense area before the surgery. = 医生在手术前就已经注意到高信号强度区域。
They had observed that the hyperintense signal was consistent with the diagnosis. = 他们已经观察到高信号强度与诊断结果一致。


将来时:
The new imaging technique will likely show the lesion as hyperintense. = 新的成像技术可能会将病灶显示为高信号强度。
We expect the treated area to be less hyperintense after the therapy. = 我们预计治疗后该区域的信号强度会降低。


虚拟语气:
If the area were hyperintense, it would suggest inflammation. = 如果该区域信号强度高，则表明有炎症。
It would be helpful if we could quantify how hyperintense the lesion is. = 如果我们能够量化病灶的高信号强度，那将很有帮助。


被动语态:
The hyperintense signal was detected by the radiologist. = 高信号强度由放射科医生检测到。
The area was identified as hyperintense on the CT scan. = 该区域在 CT 扫描中被识别为高信号强度。


疑问句:
Is the lesion hyperintense on the image? = 图像上的病灶信号强度高吗？
Are there any hyperintense areas of concern on this scan? = 此次扫描中是否有任何令人担忧的高信号强度区域？


否定句:
The area is not hyperintense on this MRI. = 该区域在本次 MRI 中信号强度不高。
The lesion was not hyperintense in the initial scan. = 病灶在初始扫描中信号强度不高。


PHRASE->
hyperintense signal = 高信号强度
hyperintense T2-weighted images = T2 加权图像高信号强度
hyperintense on MRI = MRI 高信号强度
hyperintense lesion = 高信号强度病灶
hyperintense white matter = 高信号强度白质
