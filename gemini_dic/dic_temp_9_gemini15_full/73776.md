词源:

The word "formalist" is derived from the adjective "formal," meaning relating to or concerned with form or structure, and the suffix "-ist," indicating a person who follows a particular doctrine or practice.  "Formal" itself has roots in the Latin word "forma," meaning "shape" or "form."


用法说明:


The term "formalists" can refer to individuals in various fields, including:

* **Literary Formalism:** In literature, formalists analyze the structure, style, and language of a text, independent of its historical or social context.  They examine elements such as rhyme, meter, imagery, and narrative techniques.

* **Art Formalism:** In art, formalists focus on the visual elements of the artwork, such as color, composition, line, and form, rather than its symbolic or representational meaning.

* **Musical Formalism:** In music, formalists analyze the structure and form of musical compositions, such as sonata form, fugue, or variations.

The term can sometimes carry a negative connotation, suggesting an overly rigid or pedantic approach that neglects the broader context or meaning of a work.  However, it is also a valuable and legitimate critical approach when used appropriately.
