词源:  The adverb "dignifiedly" is derived from the adjective "dignified," which in turn comes from the noun "dignity."  "Dignity" originates from the Latin word "dignitas," meaning "worthiness," "rank," or "excellence." The suffix "-ly" is added to form the adverb, indicating the manner or way in which something is done.
