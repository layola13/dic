exothermic:/ˌɛksoʊˈθɜːrmɪk/|/ˌɛɡzoʊˈθɜːrmɪk/| adj.|放热的；放出热量的|Referring to a chemical reaction or process that releases heat to its surroundings.  The released energy is often in the form of heat, but it can also be light or sound.|Example: The combustion of fuels is an exothermic reaction.|近义词：heat-releasing, heat-producing|反义词：endothermic

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The reaction is exothermic. = 反应是放热的。
Burning wood is an exothermic process. = 燃烧木材是一个放热的过程。

一般过去时:
The experiment showed an exothermic reaction. = 实验显示了一个放热反应。
The mixture became hot, indicating an exothermic change. = 混合物变热，表明发生了放热变化。

现在完成时:
Scientists have observed many exothermic reactions. = 科学家们已经观察到许多放热反应。
We have completed several exothermic experiments this semester. = 本学期我们已经完成了几个放热实验。

过去完成时:
The temperature had risen significantly because the reaction had been exothermic. = 温度已经显著升高，因为反应是放热的。
Before the explosion, the chemical reaction had already become highly exothermic. = 爆炸之前，化学反应已经变得高度放热。

将来时:
The new catalyst will make the reaction more exothermic. = 新的催化剂将使反应更加放热。
We predict that the process will be highly exothermic. = 我们预测该过程将是高度放热的。

虚拟语气:
If the reaction were exothermic, the temperature would increase. = 如果反应是放热的，温度就会升高。
It would be safer if the reaction were less exothermic. = 如果反应不那么放热，会更安全。

被动语态:
The heat was released because the reaction was exothermic. = 热量被释放是因为反应是放热的。
The process is described as exothermic because heat is released. = 该过程被称为放热是因为释放了热量。

疑问句:
Is the reaction exothermic or endothermic? = 反应是放热的还是吸热的？
Is this combustion process exothermic? = 这个燃烧过程是放热的么？

否定句:
The reaction is not exothermic; it's endothermic. = 反应不是放热的；它是吸热的。
The process is not necessarily exothermic under all conditions. = 该过程并非在所有条件下都是放热的。


PHRASE->
exothermic reaction = 放热反应
highly exothermic = 高度放热的
strongly exothermic = 强放热的
exothermic process = 放热过程
exothermic oxidation = 放热氧化
