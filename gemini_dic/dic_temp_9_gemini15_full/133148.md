词源:

The word is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the noun "ethereality."  "Ethereality" comes from "ethereal," which ultimately derives from the Greek word "aithēr" (αιθήρ), meaning "upper air," "pure air," or "clear sky."  Over time, "ethereal" came to describe something light, airy, or heavenly, and then by extension, something delicate, intangible, or spiritual.  Therefore, "nonetherealness" describes the opposite of those qualities.
