The word "overtruthfulness" is not a common word and doesn't have a direct etymological breakdown like some more established words. It's a relatively modern coinage, formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the noun "truthfulness" (the quality of being truthful).  Therefore, the word's meaning is derived directly from the meaning of its constituent parts.
