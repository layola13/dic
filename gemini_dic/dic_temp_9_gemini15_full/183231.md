represser:/rɪˈprɛsər/| n. |阻遏物；抑制物|A represser is a protein that inhibits the expression of one or more genes.  It does this by binding to the operator region of DNA, preventing RNA polymerase from transcribing the genes. Repressors are crucial in regulating gene expression, ensuring that genes are only expressed when needed.|The lac repressor protein prevents the expression of genes involved in lactose metabolism when lactose is absent.|近义词：inhibitor, suppressor|反义词：activator


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The repressor binds to the operator. = 阻遏物结合到操纵子上。
This protein acts as a repressor. = 这种蛋白质起阻遏剂的作用。


一般过去时:
The repressor prevented gene expression. = 阻遏物阻止了基因表达。
Scientists identified a new repressor protein. = 科学家们发现了一种新的阻遏蛋白。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified many repressors. = 研究人员已经鉴定了许多阻遏物。
The experiment has shown the repressor's effect. = 实验已经显示了阻遏物的效果。


过去完成时:
The gene had already been repressed before the treatment. = 在治疗之前，基因已经被抑制了。
They had discovered the repressor's mechanism of action. = 他们已经发现了阻遏物的作用机制。


将来时:
Scientists will study the repressor's structure. = 科学家们将研究阻遏物的结构。
This research will help understand repressor function. = 这项研究将有助于理解阻遏物的功能。


虚拟语气:
If the repressor were absent, the gene would be expressed. = 如果没有阻遏物，基因就会表达。
It is essential that the repressor function properly. = 阻遏物必须正常发挥作用。


被动语态:
The gene was repressed by the repressor. = 基因被阻遏物抑制了。
The repressor's activity is being studied. = 阻遏物的活性正在被研究。


疑问句:
What is the role of this repressor? = 这个阻遏物的角色是什么？
How does the repressor bind to DNA? = 阻遏物是如何结合到DNA上的？


否定句:
The repressor did not bind to the operator. = 阻遏物没有结合到操纵子上。
This mutation does not affect the repressor. = 这种突变不影响阻遏物。


PHRASE->

lac repressor: 乳糖操纵子阻遏蛋白
repressor protein: 阻遏蛋白
repressor molecule: 阻遏分子
repressor gene: 阻遏基因
