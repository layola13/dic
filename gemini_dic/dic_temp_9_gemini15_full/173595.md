quasi-induced: /ˈkwɑːzaɪɪnˈdjuːst/ | adj. | 准诱导的，似诱导的 |  Describes something that resembles or has characteristics similar to something induced, but not fully or directly caused by it.  It suggests a partial or indirect influence, often with an underlying mechanism that isn't completely understood or is difficult to isolate.  The term often appears in scientific contexts, particularly in physics and mathematics. | Example: The quasi-induced current in the circuit was weak, suggesting an incomplete coupling between the elements.  准诱导电流很弱，表明元件之间的耦合不完全。 | 近义词: apparent, seeming, indirect, partially induced | 反义词: directly induced, inherent, intrinsic | 词性: adjective
