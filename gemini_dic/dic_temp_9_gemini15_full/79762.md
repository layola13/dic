The word "glutazine" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  There is no pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage to provide.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word related to glutathione (a naturally occurring antioxidant)?
* **It's a neologism or technical term:**  It might be a newly coined word, a term specific to a particular field (like medicine or chemistry), or a brand name.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer a more informed response.
* **It's a made-up word:** It might be a fictional word from a book, game, or other creative work.
