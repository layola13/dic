词源:
Comes from the Latin word "convivium," meaning "a feast" or "banquet," which itself is composed of "con-" (together) and "vivus" (alive, living).  Thus, it originally referred to a lively gathering of people feasting together.  The "-alities" suffix adds the sense of multiple instances or qualities.
