词源:
The word "retire" comes from the Old French word "retirer," meaning "to withdraw," which itself is derived from the Latin word "retrāhere," meaning "to draw back."  The prefix "re-" indicates "back" or "again," and "trāhere" means "to draw" or "to pull."  Thus, the original meaning literally implied drawing back or withdrawing.  Over time, the meaning evolved to include the specific context of withdrawing from a position or occupation, particularly upon reaching retirement age.
