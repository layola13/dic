/ˌnɑːnˈfiːvərɪʃnəsɪz/ | n. | 非发烧状态；无发烧症状 | The word "nonfeverishnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the noun "feverishnesses," which itself is uncommon.  The intended meaning is likely the absence of feverish conditions or symptoms.  Because it's not a standard word, there are no established usages, synonyms, or antonyms.  It would be better to use more common and clearer phrasing to convey the intended meaning, such as "absence of fever," "non-feverish states," or "afebrile conditions." |  Example:  (This sentence uses the word, but it's highly unnatural and should be avoided.)  The doctor noted the patient's nonfeverishnesses during the examination.  | 近义词: absence of fever, afebrile conditions, non-feverish states | 反义词: feverish states, febrile conditions | 名词
