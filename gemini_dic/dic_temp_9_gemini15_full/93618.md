词源:
The word "imbiber" comes from the verb "imbibe," which originates from the Latin word "imbībere," meaning "to soak," "to wet," or "to drink in."  The prefix "in-" means "in" or "into," and "bibere" means "to drink."  Thus, the original meaning encompassed both the literal act of drinking and the metaphorical absorption of ideas or information.
