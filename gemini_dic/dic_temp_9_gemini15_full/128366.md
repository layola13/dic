neutrophile:/ˈnjuːtrəˌfaɪl/| n. |嗜中性粒细胞；中性粒细胞|A type of white blood cell that is a key component of the innate immune system, responsible for fighting off bacterial infections.  Neutrophils are the most abundant type of white blood cell and are characterized by their multi-lobed nucleus and their ability to engulf and destroy pathogens through phagocytosis.|Example:  A high neutrophil count in the blood can indicate an infection.  血液中嗜中性粒细胞数量高可能表明感染。|近义词:granulocyte, leukocyte|反义词:lymphocyte


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The doctor checks the patient's neutrophil count regularly. 医生定期检查病人的嗜中性粒细胞计数。
Neutrophils engulf and destroy bacteria. 中性粒细胞吞噬并破坏细菌。


一般过去时:
The patient's neutrophil count was low after the chemotherapy. 化疗后，病人的嗜中性粒细胞计数很低。
The neutrophils successfully fought off the infection. 中性粒细胞成功地抵御了感染。


现在完成时:
The infection has been successfully fought off by the neutrophils. 感染已被中性粒细胞成功抵御。
Doctors have observed a decrease in neutrophil count. 医生已经观察到嗜中性粒细胞数量减少。


过去完成时:
The patient's immune system had already been weakened before the neutrophil count dropped. 在嗜中性粒细胞计数下降之前，病人的免疫系统就已经被削弱了。
The infection had spread before the neutrophils could effectively respond. 在中性粒细胞能够有效反应之前，感染已经扩散了。


将来时:
The doctor will monitor the patient's neutrophil levels closely. 医生将密切监测病人的嗜中性粒细胞水平。
We will expect the neutrophil count to increase after treatment. 我们预计治疗后嗜中性粒细胞计数会增加。


虚拟语气:
If the neutrophil count were higher, the infection might be easier to overcome. 如果嗜中性粒细胞计数更高，感染可能会更容易克服。
I wish the patient's neutrophils were more active. 我希望病人的中性粒细胞更活跃。


被动语态:
The bacteria were engulfed and destroyed by the neutrophils. 细菌被中性粒细胞吞噬并破坏。
The neutrophil count is being monitored regularly. 嗜中性粒细胞计数正在定期监测。


疑问句:
What is the patient's neutrophil count? 病人的嗜中性粒细胞计数是多少？
Are the neutrophils effectively fighting the infection? 中性粒细胞是否有效地对抗感染？


否定句:
The patient does not have a high neutrophil count. 病人嗜中性粒细胞计数不高。
The neutrophils were not able to contain the infection. 中性粒细胞无法控制感染。


PHRASE->
low neutrophil count 低嗜中性粒细胞计数
high neutrophil count 高嗜中性粒细胞计数
neutrophil function 中性粒细胞功能
neutrophil activation 中性粒细胞活化
neutrophil infiltration 中性粒细胞浸润
