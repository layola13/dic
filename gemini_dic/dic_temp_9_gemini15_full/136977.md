nonsphericalities:/ˌnɒnˌsfɪərɪˈkælɪtiz/| n. |非球形性，非球面性 |The study of nonsphericalities in the distribution of galaxies is a growing field of astrophysics.  对星系分布的非球形性的研究是天体物理学中一个不断发展的领域。|近义词：asphericity, departure from sphericity |反义词：sphericity

英文解析:The plural form of "nonsphericity," referring to the state or quality of not being spherical; deviations from a perfectly spherical shape.  It describes irregularities or asymmetries in a three-dimensional object that prevent it from being a perfect sphere.
