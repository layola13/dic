double-play:/ˈdʌbəl pleɪ/| n.|双杀|A double play is a defensive maneuver in baseball where two runners are put out on a single play.  It usually involves a ground ball hit to an infielder, who then throws to a teammate to force one runner out at a base, and then throws to another teammate to force a second runner out.  This is a crucial defensive play that can often change the momentum of a game. |Example: The shortstop turned a brilliant double play to end the inning.  短停完成了一次精彩的双杀来结束这一局。 The second baseman snagged a line drive and initiated a double play. 二垒手接住了一记线球并发起了双杀。|近义词：double, twin kill|反义词：single, error
