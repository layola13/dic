词源:  The word "decimator" derives from the Latin word "decimāre," meaning "to select every tenth man for punishment," particularly in the context of Roman military discipline. This practice, though brutal, eventually evolved into a broader meaning of "to destroy a large portion of." The "-ator" suffix indicates an agent or doer of the action.  Thus, a decimator is literally someone or something that causes significant destruction, akin to killing one in ten, but now applied more broadly.
