/ˈdaʊnwərdnəsɪz/ | n. | 向下趋势；下降的方面；消极方面 | The downwardnesses of the economy are causing widespread concern. 经济的下行趋势引起了广泛的担忧。 | 近义词：declines, drops, setbacks, negativities | 反义词：upward trends, improvements, positivities |  

The word "downwardnesses" is not a commonly used word.  It's a relatively rare formation, created by adding the suffix "-nesses" to the adjective "downward."  This suffix typically transforms an adjective into a noun, indicating a plurality or collection of qualities or states. However, because "downward" itself already implies a direction or trend, the resulting word "downwardnesses" feels somewhat redundant and awkward in most contexts.

**Etymology:**

* **downward:**  From Old English *dūnweard*, composed of *dūn* ("down") + *weard* ("ward, direction").
* **-nesses:**  A pluralizing suffix derived from Old English *-nes*, indicating a state, quality, or condition.

**Usage Notes:**

While grammatically correct, the use of "downwardnesses" should be approached cautiously.  It's better to use more concise and natural alternatives depending on the intended meaning.  For example:

* Instead of "The downwardnesses of the situation...", try "The downward trend of the situation..." or "The negative aspects of the situation..."
* Instead of "The various downwardnesses affecting the company...", try "The various setbacks affecting the company..." or "The various downward pressures on the company..."

The word lacks a rich history of usage and its meaning is largely inferable from its components. It’s not found in standard dictionaries.  Its rarity makes it unsuitable for most writing, particularly formal writing.  In informal contexts, it might be used for humorous or ironic effect, highlighting the excessive or repetitive nature of downward trends.

**Example sentences (with more natural alternatives):**


* **Instead of:**  The multiple downwardnesses of his career led to despair.
* **Better:** The numerous setbacks in his career led to despair.


* **Instead of:** We must analyze the downwardnesses of the market before investing.
* **Better:** We must analyze the downward trends in the market before investing.  Or: We must consider the negative aspects of the market before investing.


There are no specific grammatical tense examples to provide, as the word's usage is so limited.  The typical grammatical structures used with nouns would apply (e.g., subject of a sentence, object of a verb, etc.).


**Phrases:** (Since the word itself is rarely used, phrases using it are practically nonexistent.)  It is far better to use more common and clear alternatives.
