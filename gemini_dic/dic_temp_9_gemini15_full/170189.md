protosilicate:/ˌproʊtoʊˈsɪləkeɪt/ | n. |原硅酸盐|A protosilicate is a hypothetical early form of silicate minerals, believed to have been prevalent in the early solar system and possibly on early Earth.  They are characterized by a relatively simple structure and are considered precursors to more complex silicate minerals.  Research suggests that protosilicates played a significant role in the formation of planets and the differentiation of planetary interiors. | The study of protosilicates helps us understand the early evolution of the solar system. |近义词: early silicate, primitive silicate |反义词: complex silicate
