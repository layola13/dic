词源:

reconciliatory comes from the verb "reconcile," which originates from the Old French word "reconcilier," meaning "to bring together again."  The prefix "re-" means "again," and "concilier" comes from the Latin "conciliare,"  meaning "to assemble," "to unite," or "to win over."  The "-atory" suffix indicates something that has the quality or function of doing the action of the verb.
