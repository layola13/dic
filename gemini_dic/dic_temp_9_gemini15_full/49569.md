词源:

The word "demented" comes from the past participle of the verb "demen," meaning "to be out of one's mind," or "to be mad."  "Demen" itself is derived from the Latin word "demens," which is a combination of the prefix "de-" (meaning "away from" or "out of") and "mens" (meaning "mind").  Therefore, "demens" literally means "out of mind."
