词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "mis-" (meaning wrong or bad) and the word "becoming," which means suitable or appropriate.  "Becoming" itself comes from the Old English "becuman," meaning "to become" or "to happen."  Therefore, "misbecoming" literally means "not becoming" or "not suitable."
