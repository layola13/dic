nonperversenesses:/ˌnɒn pəˈvɜːrsnəsɪz/| n.|非邪恶；非不正当；正直的行为（复数）|The word "nonperversenesses" is extremely rare and largely nonexistent in common usage. It's a compound word formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "perverseness," which itself refers to the state of being perverse or wicked. Therefore, "nonperversenesses" would theoretically refer to instances or examples of not being perverse; acts or qualities of uprightness and honesty. However, due to its unwieldiness and redundancy (the singular "nonperverseness" already conveys the meaning), it's unlikely to be encountered in everyday language or literature.  A more natural and concise way to express the idea would be to use words like "righteousness," "integrity," "honesty," or "uprightness."|例句：The supposed "nonperversenesses" of the cult leader were later revealed to be a carefully constructed facade. (这个邪教领袖所谓的“非邪恶”行为后来被揭露是精心策划的假象。)|近义词：righteousnesses, integrities, honesties, uprighteousness, rectitudes|反义词：perversenesses, wickednesses, corruptions, depravities|词性:noun
