词源:
The word "multileveled" is a compound word.  "Multi-" is a prefix meaning "many" or "multiple," derived from Latin "multus" (much, many). "Leveled" is the past participle of the verb "to level," meaning to make flat or even, or to arrange in layers or levels.  The word's meaning reflects its composite parts—many levels.
