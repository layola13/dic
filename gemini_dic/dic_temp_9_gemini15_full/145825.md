overdefiantnesses: /ˌoʊvərˌdɪˈfaɪəntnəsɪz/ | n. | 过度反抗；过度蔑视；多次的蔑视行为 |  The word "overdefiantnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a nonce word, meaning it's created for a specific occasion and not found in dictionaries. It's formed by combining "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great extent), "defiant" (showing defiance or resistance), and "-nesses" (a plural suffix indicating multiple instances or qualities).  It suggests repeated or excessive acts of defiance.  Because it's not a standard word, there are no readily available examples in common usage, synonyms, or antonyms.  Its meaning must be inferred from its constituent parts.
