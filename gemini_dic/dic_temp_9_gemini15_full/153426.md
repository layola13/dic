词源:

The word "penmanship" comes from the Middle English word "penmanshipe," a combination of "penman" (a person who writes) and the suffix "-ship," indicating skill, occupation, or condition.  "Penman" itself derives from "pen" (a writing instrument) and "man" (a person).  Therefore, the word literally means "the skill or craft of a person who uses a pen."
