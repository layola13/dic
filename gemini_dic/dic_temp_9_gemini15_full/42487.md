词源:
The word "counterglow" is a compound word.  "Counter" means "opposite" or "against," and "glow" refers to a soft light.  Therefore, "counterglow" literally means "a glow opposite" something, in this case, the sun.  Its connection to the Gegenschein reinforces this meaning, as Gegenschein is a German word meaning "counter-shine."
