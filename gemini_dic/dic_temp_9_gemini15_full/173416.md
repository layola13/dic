近义词：superficially appealing, seemingly captivating, nominally interesting | 反义词：compelling, captivating, genuinely interesting


词源：The word is a combination of "quasi," meaning "seemingly" or "apparently," and "engaging," meaning "interesting" or "attractive."  "Quasi" derives from Latin "quasi," meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost." "Engaging" comes from the verb "engage," ultimately from Old French "engager," meaning "to pledge," "to bind," or "to join," which evolved to mean "to capture interest."


USAGE->
This word, being an adjective, doesn't have verb conjugations like "What is your name?".  Instead, it modifies nouns.
