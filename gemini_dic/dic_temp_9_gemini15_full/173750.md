quasi-newly:/ˈkwɑːziˌnjuːli/ | adj. |准新的，近乎全新的 |  The term "quasi-newly" combines "quasi" (meaning seemingly, apparently, or to a certain extent) with "newly" (meaning recently made, obtained, or discovered). It describes something that is almost new but not quite, perhaps showing slight wear or use.  It suggests a condition between "new" and "used" but leaning more towards "new". | 例句：The car was quasi-newly, having only a few minor scratches. 这辆车几乎是新的，只有几处轻微划痕。

The furniture was quasi-newly; it had been displayed in a showroom.  这家具几乎是新的；它曾在展厅展出。| 近义词：almost new, nearly new, practically new, second-hand (but with minimal use)| 反义词：old, used, worn-out, antique

词源：

* **quasi-**: This prefix originates from the Latin word *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation but not a complete equivalence.

* **newly**: This word derives from the Old English word *niwe*, meaning "new."  It's a simple addition of the suffix "-ly" to form an adverb, but in this context, functions adjectivally.


USAGE->
