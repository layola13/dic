semihysterically: /ˌsɛmihaɪˈstɛrɪkli/ | adv. | 半歇斯底里地；近乎歇斯底里地 |  Describes an action or state characterized by a degree of hysteria, but not fully or completely so. It suggests a partial or incomplete loss of control due to extreme emotion. |


英文解析:The adverb "semihysterically" combines the prefix "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partially") with the adverb "hysterically" (meaning "in a manner characteristic of hysteria").  It indicates a state of near-hysteria, a behavior that shows some but not all of the signs of a complete hysterical episode.  The person might be exhibiting some uncontrolled emotional outbursts, but not to the full extent of a complete breakdown.
