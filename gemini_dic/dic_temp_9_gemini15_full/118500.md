词源:
The word "mesmerize" is derived from the name of Franz Mesmer (1734-1815), an Austrian physician who developed a system of therapy known as "mesmerism," which involved inducing a trance-like state in patients through the use of suggestion and passes.  While his methods are now considered pseudoscience, the term "mesmerize" remains to describe the captivating effect of something on a person's attention.
