词源:

The word "membraneless" is a straightforward combination of "membrane" and "less."  "Membrane" comes from the Latin word *membrana*, meaning "thin skin" or "skin," referring to a thin layer of tissue.  "-less" is a suffix indicating the absence or lack of something.  Therefore, "membraneless" literally means "without a membrane."
