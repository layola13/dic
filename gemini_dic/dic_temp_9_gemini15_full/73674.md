词源:
The word "forgetful" comes from the Old English "forgitenful," which is a combination of "forgitan" (to forget) and the suffix "-ful" (meaning "full of").  The word's evolution reflects a gradual shift in meaning from simply "full of forgetting" to the more commonly understood adjective describing a person prone to forgetting.
