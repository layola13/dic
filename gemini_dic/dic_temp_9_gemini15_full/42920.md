covariance:/koʊˈveriəns/| n. |协方差|Covariance is a statistical measure that calculates the degree to which two random variables change together.  It's a measure of the directional relationship between two variables.  A positive covariance indicates that the variables tend to move in the same direction, while a negative covariance indicates that they tend to move in opposite directions.  A covariance of zero suggests there is no linear relationship between the variables. However, it does not indicate the strength of the relationship, only the direction.|Example:  The covariance between ice cream sales and temperature is likely positive, as sales tend to increase when the temperature rises.


The covariance between hours studied and exam scores is expected to be positive.
