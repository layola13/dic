词源：The word is a compound of "queue" (a line of people waiting) and "jumping" (moving ahead suddenly and quickly). The term reflects the action of literally jumping over or bypassing the queue.  "Queue" comes from the French word "queue," meaning "tail."  The meaning evolved to refer to a line of people waiting. "Jumping" is from the Old English "jumpian."
