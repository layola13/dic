词源:

The term "Freemason" evolved over time.  The "free" part likely refers to the fact that members were not bound by the restrictive guilds of medieval times.  "Mason" refers to the stonemasons who formed the early organizations, with their skills and knowledge being passed down through generations.  The exact origins and early evolution of the organization are still debated by historians.
