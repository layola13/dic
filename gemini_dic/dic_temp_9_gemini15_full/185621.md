词源:
The word "revenue" comes from the Old French word "revenu," meaning "return," "income," or "profit."  This, in turn, is derived from the past participle of the verb "revenir," meaning "to return," which is composed of the prefix "re-" (again) and the verb "venir" (to come).  Therefore, the original sense implied something that "comes back" or is "returned" as profit or income.
