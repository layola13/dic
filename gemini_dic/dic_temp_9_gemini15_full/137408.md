nonterminals:/ˌnɒnˈtɜːrmɪnəlz/ | n. |非终结符|Symbols in a formal grammar that represent syntactic categories or phrases rather than individual words.  They are used in context-free grammars and other formal language systems to define the structure of sentences or expressions.  Unlike terminal symbols, which are the actual words or characters of the language, nonterminals are replaced by other symbols during the process of derivation, ultimately generating a string of terminal symbols. | Example: In the grammar rule "Sentence → Noun Phrase Verb Phrase," "Sentence," "Noun Phrase," and "Verb Phrase" are nonterminals.  |近义词: syntactic categories, phrase markers |反义词: terminals
