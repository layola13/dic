non-serviceable:/ˌnɒnˈsɜːvɪsəbl/ | adj. |无法维修的，无法使用的|  Unable to be repaired or used; beyond repair.

近义词：irreparable, unrepairable, unusable, beyond repair


反义词：serviceable, repairable, usable

词源:  The word is a compound of "non-" (meaning "not") and "serviceable" (meaning "capable of being serviced or repaired"). "Serviceable" itself derives from "service," ultimately from Old French "servise" and Latin "servitium," meaning "service, servitude."
