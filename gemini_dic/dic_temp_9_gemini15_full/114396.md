词源:
The phrase "make as if" is a combination of the verb "make" and the adverbial phrase "as if."  "Make" in this context means "to cause to appear," "to pretend," or "to simulate." "As if" introduces a clause describing the appearance or pretense being created. The construction originates from older English usage where "as if" was more commonly followed by a subjunctive verb form, reflecting the hypothetical nature of the action. Over time, the indicative mood has become more common, particularly in modern English.
