The word "overvary" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I will address what the word *might* mean based on its components and offer possible corrections and their analyses.

It seems likely that "overvary" is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great extent) and "vary" (meaning to change or differ).  Therefore, it might be intended to mean "to vary excessively" or "to change too much."
