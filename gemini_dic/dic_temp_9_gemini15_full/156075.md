photoprotein:/ˈfoʊtoʊˌproʊtiːn/| n. |发光蛋白|A protein that emits light, often found in bioluminescent organisms.  These proteins typically require a substrate, often a luciferin, and sometimes other cofactors, to produce light through a chemical reaction.  The light emission is often used for communication, attracting prey, or deterring predators.| Example:  Fireflies use photoproteins to create their characteristic glowing light.  = 萤火虫利用发光蛋白产生其特有的发光。|近义词：bioluminescent protein|反义词：无
