The word "cumbo" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a neologism:**  A newly coined word not yet widely accepted.  If this is the case, please provide context for its use.
* **It's a slang term or jargon:**  Specific to a particular region, community, or field.  Again, context is crucial.
* **It's a proper noun:**  A name or place name.

Please provide more information so I can assist you properly.
