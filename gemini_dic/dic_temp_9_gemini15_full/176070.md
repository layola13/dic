词源:
The word "ravished" comes from the Old French word "raviss," meaning "to seize, carry off."  This in turn has roots in the Latin word "rapere," meaning "to snatch, seize, carry off by force."  The modern usage encompassing both delight and violence reflects the evolution of the word's meaning over time.
