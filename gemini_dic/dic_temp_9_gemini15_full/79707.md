glycogen:/ˈɡlaɪkədʒən/| n. |糖原|A polysaccharide of glucose that serves as a form of energy storage in animals and fungi.  It is the animal equivalent of starch. Glycogen is made and stored in the liver and muscles.  |例句：The liver stores glycogen to regulate blood sugar levels. 肝脏储存糖原以调节血糖水平。|例句：Muscles use glycogen as a quick source of energy during exercise. 肌肉在运动时使用糖原作为快速能量来源。|近义词：starch (in plants), glucose polymer|反义词：None  specifically;  perhaps  "glucose" in a metabolic sense (as glycogen is broken down into glucose).|名词
