hyperchromatism:/ˌhaɪpərˈkroʊməˌtɪzəm/| n. |高色素沉着，增色性|Increased coloration or absorption of light by a substance, often due to changes in its structure or composition.  This term is frequently used in biochemistry and molecular biology to describe an increase in the absorbance of ultraviolet (UV) light by DNA, usually due to denaturation or other structural changes. |Example:  The hyperchromism observed in the DNA sample indicates that it has undergone denaturation.  高色素沉着在DNA样本中观察到，表明它已经变性。|近义词：increased absorbance, enhanced coloration |反义词：hypochromism
