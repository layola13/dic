diamides:/ˈdaɪæmaɪdz/| n. |二酰胺|A diamide is an organic compound containing two amide groups.  Diamides are found in various natural products and are used in many industrial applications, such as in the production of polymers and pharmaceuticals. They are characterized by the presence of two carbonyl groups (C=O) linked to nitrogen atoms. |Example:  Oxamide is a simple diamide with two amide groups attached to a central carbon atom. 草酰胺是一种简单的二酰胺，其两个酰胺基团连接到中心碳原子上。|近义词:diacylamines|反义词:None directly applicable.
