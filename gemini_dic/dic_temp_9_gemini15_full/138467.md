词源:

The word "novelist" comes from the word "novel," meaning a long fictional story.  "Novel" itself has its roots in the Italian word "novella," a diminutive of "novella," meaning "new."  The suffix "-ist" is a common English suffix indicating a person who does something or is associated with something. Thus, "novelist" signifies a person who writes novels.
