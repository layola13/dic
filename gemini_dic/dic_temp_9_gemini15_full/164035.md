词源:
The word "prediscern" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the verb "discern" (meaning "to perceive or recognize").  Thus, it literally means "to perceive or recognize beforehand."  The root of "discern" is from the Latin word "discernere," meaning "to separate, distinguish."
