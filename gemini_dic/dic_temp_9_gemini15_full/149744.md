palatalising: /ˈpælətəlaɪzɪŋ/ | v. | 颚化；软腭化 | The process of articulating a consonant sound with the tongue close to or touching the palate (the hard roof of the mouth). This often results in a change in the sound of the consonant.  | Example:  In many languages, the sound /k/ can be palatalized to /c/ or /kj/ before a front vowel.  The palatalisation of /k/ to /tʃ/ is common in some dialects of English.  | 近义词: palatalization | 反义词:  None specifically, but the opposite would be the lack of palatalization.
