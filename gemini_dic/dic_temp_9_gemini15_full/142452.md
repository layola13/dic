oscilloscope:/ˈɒsɪləskoʊp/ | /ˈɑːsɪləskoʊp/ | n. |示波器 |An oscilloscope is an electronic instrument that allows the observation of changing electrical voltage signals in the form of a two-dimensional graph.  It displays the signal's amplitude (voltage) as a function of time. This makes it invaluable for analyzing and troubleshooting electronic circuits, signals, and systems. |The technician used an oscilloscope to diagnose the problem with the faulty circuit.  工程师用示波器诊断故障电路的问题。|  waveform analyzer,  signal analyzer |  (no direct antonym, but could be described as the opposite of a device that *doesn't* display voltage signals)


USAGE->
