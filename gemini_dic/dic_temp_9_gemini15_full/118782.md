词源:
The term "metallorganic" is a combination of "metal" and "organic," reflecting its nature as a compound bridging the gap between inorganic metal chemistry and organic chemistry.  "Metal" derives from Old French *metal, from Latin metallum "mine, metal." "Organic" derives from  Greek *organikos, from *organon "tool, instrument, organ."  The combination highlights the unique nature of these compounds, containing both metal and carbon-based components.
