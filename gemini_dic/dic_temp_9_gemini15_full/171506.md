词源:

The word "pugnacity" derives from the Latin word "pugnax," meaning "fighting," "warlike," or "combative."  "Pugnax" itself is derived from "pugnus," meaning "fist."  The suffix "-ity" is a common English suffix that transforms adjectives into nouns, indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, "pugnacity" literally means "the quality of being fist-like" or "the state of being combative."


用法说明:

It's often used to describe a personality trait or the characteristic behavior of a group. The word carries a somewhat negative connotation, implying a readiness to engage in unnecessary conflict.  It is less commonly used in everyday conversation and is more prevalent in formal writing or academic discussions.
