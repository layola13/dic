词源:

The word "preconsented" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and the past participle "consented" (from the verb "consent," meaning "to give permission or agreement").  Therefore, it literally means "agreed to beforehand."  The word is relatively infrequent, reflecting its specific meaning.  It's not a word found in common everyday usage.
