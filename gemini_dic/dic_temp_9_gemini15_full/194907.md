PHRASE->

(This adverb doesn't typically form common phrases.  Phrases would be built around the actions it modifies.)  For example:

to write semi-illiterately
to communicate semi-illiterately
to express oneself semi-illiterately
to leave a semi-illiterate note
to scribble semi-illiterately


词源:

* **semi-**:  Latin prefix meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."
* **illiterate**: From Latin *illiteratus*, from *in-* (not) + *litteratus* (literate, educated), ultimately from *littera* (letter).

Therefore, "semi-illiterately" means "in a way that is partly or partially illiterate."
