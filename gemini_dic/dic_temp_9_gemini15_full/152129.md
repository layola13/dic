pathotoxin: /ˈpæθəʊtɒksɪn/ | n. | 病原毒素 | A toxin produced by a pathogenic organism.  A pathotoxin is a toxic substance produced by a disease-causing organism (pathogen) that contributes to the development of the disease. These toxins can directly damage host cells or interfere with host functions, leading to disease symptoms.  | Example:  The bacterium produced a potent pathotoxin that caused severe tissue damage in the infected patients.  细菌产生了一种强效的病原毒素，导致感染患者严重的组织损伤。|近义词：toxin, venom, poison |反义词：antitoxin
