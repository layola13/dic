词源:
The word "engineer" ultimately derives from the Old French word "enginieur,"  meaning "builder of engines."  "Engine" itself comes from the Latin "ingenium," meaning "clever invention" or "ingenuity".  The original meaning referred to those who built military engines (siege weapons), but the term expanded to encompass a much wider range of construction and design professions.
