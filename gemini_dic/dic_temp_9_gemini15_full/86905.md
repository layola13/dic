hemitropy:/ˈhɛmɪˌtroʊpi/| n.|半旋性，半同晶现象|Hemitropy refers to a type of twinning in crystals where two individual crystals are mirror images of each other across a plane.  This results in a crystal structure that exhibits a partial symmetry, often appearing as if one half has been rotated relative to the other.|Example: The mineral exhibited hemitropy, with one half a mirror image of the other across a specific plane.  半旋性晶体的一个例子是，晶体的某一半是晶体另一半关于一个特定平面的镜像。|近义词：twinning, partial symmetry|反义词：holotropy (complete symmetry)|名词
