词源:
The word "pervert" comes from the Old French word "pervertir," meaning "to corrupt, spoil, or destroy."  This in turn derives from the Latin "pervertere," which is a compound of "per-" (through, completely) and "vertere" (to turn). The original sense was not specifically sexual, but implied a twisting or corruption of something from its proper state.  The modern sexual connotation developed later.
