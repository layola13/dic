fibrinogen:/ˌfaɪˈbrɪnədʒən/| n. |纤维蛋白原|A soluble protein that is present in blood plasma and is converted into fibrin by the action of thrombin during blood clotting.|例句：Fibrinogen levels are often monitored in patients with clotting disorders.  纤维蛋白原水平通常在凝血障碍患者中进行监测。|近义词：coagulation factor I|反义词：fibrin (in the context of its inactive state)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Fibrinogen plays a crucial role in blood clotting. = 纤维蛋白原在血液凝固中起着至关重要的作用。
The body constantly produces fibrinogen. = 机体不断产生纤维蛋白原。


一般过去时:
The doctor checked the patient's fibrinogen levels. = 医生检查了病人的纤维蛋白原水平。
Researchers studied the fibrinogen's role in wound healing. = 研究人员研究了纤维蛋白原在伤口愈合中的作用。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered much about fibrinogen's function. = 科学家们已经发现了许多关于纤维蛋白原功能的知识。
The patient has shown improved fibrinogen levels since starting treatment. = 自从开始治疗以来，病人的纤维蛋白原水平有所改善。


过去完成时:
Before the surgery, the surgeon had checked the patient's fibrinogen levels. = 在手术前，外科医生检查了病人的纤维蛋白原水平。
The study had shown a correlation between high fibrinogen and heart disease. = 该研究表明高纤维蛋白原与心脏病之间存在相关性。


将来时:
Doctors will monitor the patient's fibrinogen levels closely. = 医生将密切监测病人的纤维蛋白原水平。
Further research will reveal more about fibrinogen's complex functions. = 进一步的研究将揭示纤维蛋白原更复杂的机能。


虚拟语气:
If the fibrinogen levels were lower, the clotting process would be impaired. = 如果纤维蛋白原水平较低，凝血过程就会受损。
It would be beneficial if we could control fibrinogen levels more effectively. = 如果我们能够更有效地控制纤维蛋白原水平，那将是有益的。


被动语态:
Fibrinogen is converted into fibrin by thrombin. = 纤维蛋白原被凝血酶转化为纤维蛋白。
The patient's fibrinogen levels were carefully measured. = 病人的纤维蛋白原水平被仔细测量。


疑问句:
What is the normal range for fibrinogen levels? = 纤维蛋白原水平的正常范围是多少？
Are there any medications that affect fibrinogen production? = 有任何药物会影响纤维蛋白原的产生吗？


否定句:
The patient did not have dangerously low fibrinogen levels. = 病人的纤维蛋白原水平没有低到危险的程度。
This study did not find a significant correlation between fibrinogen and this condition. = 这项研究没有发现纤维蛋白原与这种情况之间存在显著的相关性。


PHRASE->
fibrinogen levels = 纤维蛋白原水平
low fibrinogen = 低纤维蛋白原
high fibrinogen = 高纤维蛋白原
fibrinogen deficiency = 纤维蛋白原缺乏症
fibrinogen concentration = 纤维蛋白原浓度
