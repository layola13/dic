词源:
The word "contrive" comes from the Old French word "controver," meaning "to struggle against," "to oppose," or "to devise."  This in turn stems from the Latin "con" (together) + "triviāre" (to find a way or path). The original meaning was more neutral, emphasizing the act of finding a way, but over time it shifted to include a sense of cunning or deviousness.
