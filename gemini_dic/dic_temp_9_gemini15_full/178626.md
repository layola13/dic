recoverance: /rɪˈkʌvərəns/ | n. | 复原；恢复；痊愈；索回；追回 | The process of regaining or getting something back, or the state of being regained.  This word is largely archaic and rarely used in modern English. It refers to the act of recovering something lost or regaining a former state.  | Example:  The recoverance of his stolen property was a relief.  他的失窃财物被追回让他松了一口气。 | 近义词：recovery, restoration, retrieval | 反义词：loss, destruction


USAGE->
This word is almost exclusively used in the past tense or as a noun describing a completed action.  Therefore, many standard verb tenses are not applicable.

一般过去时:
The recoverance of the lost documents was swift. = 失窃文件的追回很快。
His recoverance from the illness was remarkable. = 他从病中恢复得令人吃惊。


现在完成时:

PHRASE->
There are few common phrases using "recoverance" due to its archaic nature.  Phrases using "recovery" are far more common.  Examples using "recovery" instead:

speedy recovery =  迅速康复
economic recovery = 经济复苏
data recovery = 数据恢复
muscle recovery = 肌肉恢复

注意事项:

This word is largely obsolete and should generally be avoided in modern writing.  "Recovery" is the preferred modern equivalent.
