The word "hiron" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and usage examples cannot be provided.  It's possible:

* It's a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* It's a proper noun (a name, place, etc.).
* It's a word from a dialect or specialized jargon.
* It's a newly coined word.

If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer a more informed response.
