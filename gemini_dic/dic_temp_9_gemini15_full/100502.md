词源:

The word "interventionism" is derived from the verb "intervene," which comes from the Latin words "inter" (between) and "venire" (to come).  Therefore, "intervene" literally means "to come between."  The suffix "-ism" is added to create a noun indicating a doctrine, system, or practice.  The term thus describes the ideology or policy of intervening in the affairs of others.
