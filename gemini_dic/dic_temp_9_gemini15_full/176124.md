词源:
The word "razor" ultimately derives from the Old French word "rasoir," meaning "to scrape" or "shave."  This in turn comes from the Vulgar Latin word "rasium," a diminutive form of "radere," meaning "to scrape" or "shave."  The connection to scraping and shaving is clear throughout its evolution.
