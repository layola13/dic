inequation:/ˌɪniˈkweɪʃən/ | n. |不等式|An inequation is a mathematical statement that shows a relationship between two expressions that are not equal.  It uses inequality symbols such as < (less than), > (greater than), ≤ (less than or equal to), ≥ (greater than or equal to), or ≠ (not equal to).|Example: 2x + 3 > 7 (This inequation states that 2x + 3 is greater than 7).|近义词：inequality|反义词：equation


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The inequation shows the relationship between x and y. = 不等式显示了x和y之间的关系。
This inequation holds true for all positive values of x. = 这个不等式对所有正值的x都成立。


一般过去时:
The inequation was solved by using algebraic manipulation. = 不等式是通过代数运算解出的。
The students learned how to solve inequations in the last lesson. = 学生们在上节课学习了解不等式的方法。


现在完成时:
We have solved several inequations today. = 我们今天已经解出了几个不等式。
The mathematician has developed a new method for solving complex inequations. = 数学家已经开发出一种解决复杂不等式的新方法。


过去完成时:
They had already solved the inequation before the teacher explained the solution. = 老师解释答案之前，他们已经解出了不等式。
I had never encountered such a complicated inequation before. = 我以前从未遇到过如此复杂的不等式。


将来时:
We will solve this inequation in the next class. = 我们将在下一节课解这个不等式。
Scientists will use this inequation to predict future trends. = 科学家们将用这个不等式来预测未来的趋势。


虚拟语气:
If we knew the value of x, we could solve the inequation easily. = 如果我们知道x的值，就能很容易地解出这个不等式。
If only I had understood inequations better in school. = 要是我在学校的时候更懂不等式就好了。


被动语态:

The solution to the inequation is being discussed in the forum. = 不等式的解法正在论坛中讨论。


疑问句:
What is the solution to this inequation? = 这个不等式的解是什么？
Can you explain how to graph this inequation? = 你能解释一下如何绘制这个不等式的图像吗？


否定句:
This inequation is not true for negative values of x. = 这个不等式对x的负值不成立。
They didn't understand how to solve the inequation. = 他们不明白如何解这个不等式。


PHRASE->
solve an inequation = 解不等式
graph an inequation = 绘制不等式图像
linear inequation = 一元一次不等式
quadratic inequation = 一元二次不等式
