词源:
The word "pinhole" is a compound word.  "Pin" refers to a thin, pointed piece of metal, and "hole" refers to an opening.  The combination describes a small hole, typically one small enough to be made by a pin.  The word's etymology traces back to the Old English words "pinne" (pin) and "hol" (hole).
