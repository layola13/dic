rechromatography:/ˌriːkrəʊməˈtɑːɡrəfi/| n. |再色谱法|The process of subjecting a substance to chromatography a second time, usually to further purify or separate components that were not fully resolved in the initial chromatography.|例句：Rechromatography of the initial fraction yielded three distinct compounds. 再色谱分离初始馏分得到三种不同的化合物。|近义词：repeated chromatography, secondary chromatography |反义词：initial chromatography
