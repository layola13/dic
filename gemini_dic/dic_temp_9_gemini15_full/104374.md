kabaddi:/kəˈbɑːdiː/|/kəˈbædiː/| n. |卡巴迪|A contact team sport played primarily in South Asia,  involving two teams of seven players who take turns raiding each other's half of the court to score points.  The raider must hold their breath and chant "kabaddi" while in the opponent's territory to avoid being tagged. | Example:  My brother is a skilled kabaddi player.  我哥哥是个熟练的卡巴迪运动员。

The origins of kabaddi are ancient, with some evidence suggesting it may have roots in pre-Vedic India.  While its exact origins are debated, versions of the game have been played for centuries across South Asia. The modern rules and structure were largely formalized in the 20th century, leading to its rise as a popular competitive sport.  The name itself, "kabaddi," is believed to derive from the Tamil word "kai pidi," meaning "to hold hands," which reflects a key element of the game's original forms.
