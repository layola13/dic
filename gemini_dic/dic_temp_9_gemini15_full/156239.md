phycocyanin:/ˌfaɪkoʊˈsaɪənɪn/| n. |藻蓝蛋白|A blue pigment found in cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) and some other algae.  It's a type of phycobiliprotein, a protein-pigment complex that acts as an accessory pigment in photosynthesis, absorbing light energy and transferring it to chlorophyll. Phycocyanin is also being investigated for its potential health benefits, such as antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.|例句：Researchers are studying the potential health benefits of phycocyanin extracted from spirulina. 研究人员正在研究从螺旋藻中提取的藻蓝蛋白的潜在健康益处。|近义词：phycobiliprotein|反义词：None specifically.
