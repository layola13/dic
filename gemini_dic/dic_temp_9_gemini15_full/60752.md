electrofocusing: /ɪˌlɛktrəʊˈfoʊkəsɪŋ/ | n. | 电聚焦 | A technique used in biochemistry to separate molecules based on their isoelectric points.  It involves applying an electric field to a solution containing the molecules, causing them to migrate until they reach a point where their net charge is zero (their isoelectric point). This results in the separation of molecules into distinct bands. | Example: Electrofocusing is a powerful tool for separating proteins with similar molecular weights.  电聚焦是分离具有相似分子量的蛋白质的有力工具。| 近义词：isoelectric focusing, IEF | 反义词：无
