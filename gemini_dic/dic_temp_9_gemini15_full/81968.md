grindabilities:/ˌɡraɪndəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可磨性，研磨能力 | The ability of a substance to be ground or pulverized.  This term is primarily used in technical contexts, particularly in materials science and engineering, referring to the ease with which a material can be reduced to smaller particles through grinding or milling.  |  Example: The grindabilities of different ores vary significantly, affecting processing efficiency.  不同矿石的可磨性差异很大，影响加工效率。The high grindabilities of this material made it ideal for the production of fine powders.  这种材料的高可磨性使其成为生产细粉的理想选择。| 近义词：grindability, pulverizability | 反义词：ungrindability, non-pulverizability | 名词
