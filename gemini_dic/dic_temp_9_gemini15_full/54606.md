词源:
The word "dismayed" comes from the Old French word "desmaier," meaning "to faint; to lose courage."  This in turn has roots in the Latin word "ex-," meaning "out," and "anima," meaning "soul," or "spirit."  The prefix "dis-" adds a sense of negation or removal, resulting in the modern sense of being disheartened or losing spirit.
