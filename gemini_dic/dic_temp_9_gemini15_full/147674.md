overpotential:/ˌoʊvərpoʊˈtɛnʃəl/| n. |超电势，过电势 |The extra voltage required beyond the thermodynamic potential to drive an electrochemical reaction at a certain rate.  It represents the energy barrier that must be overcome for the reaction to proceed. This extra voltage is needed to compensate for losses due to factors such as slow electron transfer kinetics, mass transport limitations, and concentration polarization.|Example: The overpotential for hydrogen evolution on a platinum electrode is relatively low, while it is significantly higher on a lead electrode.  铂电极上析氢的超电势相对较低，而铅电极上则高得多。|近义词：excess potential, extra voltage|反义词：N/A
