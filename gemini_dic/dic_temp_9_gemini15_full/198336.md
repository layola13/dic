词源:
The term "show business" is a compound word. "Show" refers to a public performance or spectacle, while "business" indicates the commercial and organizational aspects of such performances.  The combination reflects the dual nature of the entertainment industry as both a creative endeavor and a profit-driven enterprise.  Its origins are in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coinciding with the rise of vaudeville, theater, and early cinema.
