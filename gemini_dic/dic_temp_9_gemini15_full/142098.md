词源:
The word "orientated" comes from the verb "orient," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "oriens," meaning "rising (of the sun)."  The original sense referred to determining one's position relative to the rising sun (east). Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass any kind of focusing or directing.  The "-ated" suffix is a past participle form, indicating a state of being oriented.
