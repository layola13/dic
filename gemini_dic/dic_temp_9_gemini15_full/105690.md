USAGE->
This word is primarily a command-line utility and doesn't have grammatical tenses in the same way verbs in natural language do.  The usage is solely within the context of a Kerberos environment.  There's no "past tense" of kinit; you either successfully run it or you don't.


PHRASE->
kinit -kt /path/to/keytab principal  (Use a keytab file)
kinit -f principal  (Use a credential cache)

注意事项:

The phonetic transcription is based on a general pronunciation and may vary slightly depending on accent.  The word itself doesn't have antonyms in the usual sense; it's an action, not a quality.  The "phrases" are command-line options for the `kinit` command.  There are no grammatical tenses or other linguistic categories applicable to this command.
