词源:
The word "miasmatic" derives from the Greek word "miasma" (μίασμα), meaning "pollution," "stain," or "defilement."  This Greek term was often used to refer to the foul air believed to cause disease, a theory prevalent before the understanding of germ theory.  The suffix "-atic" is added to form the adjective.
