Etymology:

The word "powter" originates from the now-obsolete verb "powter," meaning "to puff oneself up," "to swell," or "to strut." This likely refers to the puffed-up appearance of the powter pigeon breed, with its large crop.  The meaning shifted to describe a person with a similarly inflated self-image.  The connection to the bird's appearance is the primary etymological root.
