词源:
The word "gloat" comes from the Middle English word "gloten," which meant "to stare," "to glare," or "to look intently."  The modern meaning developed over time, evolving from a sense of intense, often envious, observation to one of smug self-satisfaction derived from another's misfortune or one's own success.
