glutamate:/ˈɡluːtəmeɪt/| n. |谷氨酸 |Glutamate is a naturally occurring amino acid that acts as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous system. It plays a crucial role in various physiological processes, including nerve impulse transmission, learning, and memory. Excessive glutamate can lead to excitotoxicity, damaging nerve cells. |Example:  Glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. 谷氨酸是大脑中最丰富的兴奋性神经递质。

|Example:  High levels of glutamate have been linked to neurodegenerative diseases. 高水平的谷氨酸与神经退行性疾病有关。|近义词: glutamic acid |反义词: N/A |名词
