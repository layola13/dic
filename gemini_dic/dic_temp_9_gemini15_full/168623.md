proclitic:/ˈproʊklɪtɪk/ | adj. | 紧附词，倚词 | A proclitic is a word or morpheme that is phonologically reduced and attached to the following word.  It typically lacks stress and is often unstressed,  appearing as a prefix or clitic. Unlike a clitic, a proclitic is attached to the *beginning* of a word or phrase. | Example:  In some dialects of English, the word "to" in "to go" can be reduced and pronounced as a proclitic, almost merging with "go".  |近义词：clitic (but with a crucial distinction in placement) |反义词：enclitic (attached to the end of a word)


词源:  From  Greek *proklinein* "to lean forward," from *pro-* "forward" + *klinein* "to lean."  Reflecting its leaning onto the following word.


用法说明：

Proclitics are a feature of phonology and morphology. They are not a separate grammatical category like nouns or verbs. Their defining characteristic is their phonological reduction and attachment to a following word. They often appear in spoken language more than in written language, as their pronunciation changes significantly in context.


例句：

1.  In some varieties of English, the word "to" in "to swim" can be pronounced as a proclitic, sounding almost like a part of "swim". = 在某些英语方言中，“to swim”中的“to”可以发音为紧附词，听起来几乎像是“swim”的一部分。


2.  The article "a" in "a house" might be reduced and proclitic in fast speech. = 在快速的语速中，“a house”中的冠词“a”可能会被缩减并成为紧附词。


由于proclitic本身不是一个独立的词类，因此无法像名词、动词那样进行时态、语态等语法分析。  其语法功能取决于其本身的词性以及它所依附的词的语法功能。  例如，一个pronoun作proclitic时，仍然保持其代词的语法功能。
