erotica:/ɪˈrɒtɪkə/| n. |色情作品；春宫图| Writings, pictures, etc., intended to arouse sexual desire.

It differs from pornography in that it often prioritizes aesthetic value, artistic merit, or emotional depth alongside or in place of purely prurient interest. |例句：The bookstore had a small but well-stocked section devoted to erotica. 这家书店有一个虽小但收藏丰富的色情读物专区。
