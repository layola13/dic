The word "prealluding" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It seems to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full etymological breakdown and grammatical analysis are impossible.  If you meant a different word, or if you could provide context where you encountered this word, a more accurate analysis could be provided.
