iterator:/ˈɪtəreɪtər/| n. |迭代器，遍历器 |An iterator is an object that allows you to traverse through a data structure (like a list, array, or set) one element at a time, without needing to know the underlying implementation details. It provides a way to access elements sequentially, often without needing to know the total number of elements in advance.  |Example:  In Python, you can use an iterator to loop through a list: `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]; my_iterator = iter(my_list); print(next(my_iterator)); print(next(my_iterator));` This will print "1" then "2". |近义词: traverser, cursor |反义词:None


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The iterator accesses each element one by one. = 迭代器一次访问一个元素。
This iterator returns a value in each iteration. = 此迭代器在每次迭代中返回一个值。


一般过去时:
The iterator moved to the next element in the sequence. = 迭代器移动到序列中的下一个元素。
The iterator processed all elements successfully. = 迭代器成功处理所有元素。


现在完成时:
The iterator has traversed the entire dataset. = 迭代器已经遍历了整个数据集。
The program has used the iterator to access all items. = 程序已经使用迭代器访问所有项目。


过去完成时:
The iterator had already reached the end of the list before the error occurred. = 在错误发生之前，迭代器已经到达列表的末尾。
The process had completed iterating through the database before the shutdown. = 在关闭之前，该过程已经完成了对数据库的迭代。


将来时:
The iterator will process the next batch of data. = 迭代器将处理下一批数据。
The loop will use an iterator to go through the entire collection. = 循环将使用迭代器遍历整个集合。


虚拟语气:
If the iterator were to encounter an empty set, it would throw an exception. = 如果迭代器遇到空集，它将抛出异常。
It would be better if the iterator handled null values gracefully. = 如果迭代器能够优雅地处理空值，那就更好了。


被动语态:
The data is accessed by the iterator sequentially. = 数据由迭代器顺序访问。
The list was successfully iterated through by the iterator. = 列表由迭代器成功迭代。


疑问句:
Does this iterator support bidirectional traversal? = 此迭代器支持双向遍历吗？
What type of data does this iterator return? = 此迭代器返回什么类型的数据？


否定句:
The iterator did not find the desired element. = 迭代器没有找到所需的元素。
This iterator does not support random access. = 此迭代器不支持随机访问。


PHRASE->
iterator pattern = 迭代器模式
external iterator = 外部迭代器
internal iterator = 内部迭代器
forward iterator = 前向迭代器
bidirectional iterator = 双向迭代器
