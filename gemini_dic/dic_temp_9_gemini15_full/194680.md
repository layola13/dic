词源:
The word "self-ventilated" is a compound word.  "Self" indicates that the ventilation is inherent to the structure or system. "Ventilated" comes from the Latin "ventilare," meaning "to fan," "to winnow," or "to air."  The suffix "-ated" indicates a process or state.  Therefore, "self-ventilated" literally means "having its own ventilation."
