This word is not a standard English word.  It's a neologism, meaning a newly coined word or expression. It's formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "imaginariness" (the state or quality of being imaginary), and then adding the plural suffix "-es".  Therefore, it literally means "the states or qualities of not being imaginary."


Because it's not a standard word, there is no established usage in dictionaries or style guides.  Any attempt to provide grammatical examples would be artificial and based on the logical construction of the word rather than actual usage.  The example sentence provided demonstrates a potential usage, but its acceptability depends entirely on the context and the writer's intent.  It would be highly unusual in most forms of writing.

The word is likely to be understood by educated speakers of English due to its transparent construction, but its use should be avoided in formal writing unless the writer is deliberately aiming for a highly unusual or creative effect.  More common and accepted synonyms would be preferred in most contexts.
