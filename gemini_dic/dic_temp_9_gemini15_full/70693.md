finalizers:/ˈfaɪnəlaɪzərz/| n.|终结器，最终确定者|A finalizer is a special method in object-oriented programming that is automatically called by the garbage collector just before an object is destroyed.  It's used for releasing resources held by the object, such as closing files or network connections.|Example:  In Java, the `finalize()` method acts as a finalizer.  Python uses `__del__` for similar purposes.  |近义词：destructor,terminator|反义词：initializer,constructor|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The system uses finalizers to clean up memory. = 系统使用终结器来清理内存。
Finalizers ensure that resources are released. = 终结器确保资源得到释放。


一般过去时:
The finalizers ran successfully. = 终结器成功运行。
The program used finalizers to close files. = 程序使用终结器来关闭文件。


现在完成时:
The garbage collector has already called the finalizers. = 垃圾收集器已经调用了终结器。
The application has successfully completed its finalizers. = 应用程序已成功完成其终结器。


过去完成时:
The system had completed all finalizers before shutting down. = 系统在关闭之前已完成所有终结器。
The program had run its finalizers before exiting. = 程序在退出之前已运行其终结器。


将来时:
The finalizers will run when the objects are garbage collected. = 当对象被垃圾回收时，终结器将运行。
The system will automatically call the finalizers. = 系统将自动调用终结器。


虚拟语气:
If we used finalizers, we would avoid resource leaks. = 如果我们使用终结器，我们将避免资源泄漏。
It would be better if the finalizers were more reliable. = 如果终结器更可靠就好了。


被动语态:
Finalizers are called by the garbage collector. = 终结器由垃圾收集器调用。
Resources are released when the finalizers are executed. = 当终结器执行时，资源将被释放。


疑问句:
Are finalizers necessary in this case? = 在这种情况下，终结器是必要的吗？
How many finalizers are running concurrently? = 同时运行多少个终结器？


否定句:
The program doesn't use finalizers. = 该程序不使用终结器。
Finalizers aren't always guaranteed to run. = 终结器并不总是保证运行。



PHRASE->
object finalizers = 对象终结器
Java finalizers = Java 终结器
C++ finalizers = C++ 终结器
Python finalizers = Python 终结器
garbage collection finalizers = 垃圾收集终结器
