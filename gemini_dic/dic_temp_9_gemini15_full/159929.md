polyphase:/ˈpɒliˌfeɪz/ /ˈpɑːliˌfeɪz/ | adj. |多相的；多相位的|Having or involving more than one phase; specifically, relating to electrical systems with more than one alternating current.  A polyphase system is more efficient and provides a smoother power delivery than a single-phase system.  The term is often used in electrical engineering to describe systems with multiple alternating current phases, typically three-phase systems. |例句：The motor uses a polyphase induction motor, providing greater power and efficiency.  这个电机使用多相感应电机，提供更大的功率和效率。|  例句：Three-phase power is a common type of polyphase system used in industrial applications.  三相电力是工业应用中常用的多相系统类型。|近义词：multiphase|反义词：single-phase|形容词


USAGE->

This word is primarily an adjective and doesn't have verb or noun conjugations in the same way as "what".  Therefore, typical verb conjugations are not applicable.  Instead, example sentences demonstrating its usage in different contexts are provided.
