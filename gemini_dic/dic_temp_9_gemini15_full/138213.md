The word "noshable" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word, perhaps slang, jargon specific to a certain community, or a misspelling.

To provide a response in the requested format, I'll need a valid English word.  If you meant a different word, or can provide more context on where you encountered "noshable," I can offer a more helpful response.
