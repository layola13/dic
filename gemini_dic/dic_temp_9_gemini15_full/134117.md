词源:

The word "nonimpartation" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "impartation" (the act of imparting or communicating).  "Impartation" itself comes from the verb "impart," which has roots in the Old French word "impartir" and ultimately from the Latin "impartire," meaning "to divide, share, or communicate."  Therefore, "nonimpartation" literally means "the act of not imparting" or "the act of not sharing or communicating."
