词源:
The origin of "chump" is uncertain, but it likely evolved from the earlier word "chump" meaning a thick slice or piece of something, often food.  This sense carried over into the figurative meaning of a "thick" or "dull" person, easily taken advantage of.  The connection is likely based on the idea of something easily cut or manipulated.
