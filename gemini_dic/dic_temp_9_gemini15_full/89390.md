homoplasy:/ˈhoʊməˌplæzi/| n. |趋同进化，同形异源|The resemblance of structures that have different origins, resulting from convergent evolution.  This means that two or more species may have similar traits, but these traits evolved independently, not from a common ancestor. For example, the wings of birds and bats are analogous structures; they are similar in function and appearance but evolved independently.  | Example: The streamlined body shape of dolphins and sharks is a classic example of homoplasy.  They share a similar body shape because it is advantageous for swimming, not because they share a recent common ancestor. |近义词：convergent evolution, analogy |反义词：homology


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in biology and evolutionary studies;  therefore, grammatical tense usage examples are less relevant than specific contextual examples within the field.  Instead of providing standard tense examples,  the following illustrates homoplasy's use in different scientific contexts:


Example 1 (describing a phenomenon):

The striking similarities in the beaks of Darwin's finches, despite their divergence, highlight the potential for homoplasy in adaptive radiation. = 达尔文雀喙的惊人相似性，尽管它们已经分化，却突显了适应性辐射中趋同进化的潜力。


Example 2 (contrasting with homology):

Unlike homology, which reflects shared ancestry, homoplasy arises from independent evolutionary pathways leading to similar traits. = 与反映共同祖先的同源性不同，趋同进化源于导致相似性状的独立进化途径。


Example 3 (in a research paper):

Our phylogenetic analysis revealed several instances of homoplasy in the evolution of floral morphology. = 我们的系统发育分析揭示了花形态进化中趋同进化的几个例子。


Example 4 (explaining a research finding):

The observed convergence in wing shape between the two insect species is likely due to homoplasy, driven by similar selective pressures. = 观察到的两种昆虫物种的翅膀形状趋同，很可能是由于趋同进化，是由相似的选择压力驱动的。


Example 5 (in a textbook):

Homoplasy is a significant challenge in phylogenetic reconstruction, as it can obscure true evolutionary relationships. = 趋同进化是系统发育重建中的一个重大挑战，因为它会掩盖真正的进化关系。


PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases directly incorporating "homoplasy."  The term is used within scientific sentences and paragraphs.  However, related phrases used in evolutionary biology could include:


1.  Convergent evolution:  A phrase directly synonymous with homoplasy in many contexts.
2.  Analogous structures:  Structures that are similar in function but have different evolutionary origins.
3.  Parallel evolution:  Independent evolution of similar traits in closely related species.
4.  Adaptive convergence:  Evolution of similar traits in response to similar environmental pressures.
5.  Phylogenetic analysis: Often used in studies that attempt to identify and account for homoplasy.
