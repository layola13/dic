The word "euphroe" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no standard pronunciation, grammatical function, meaning, or usage.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific dialect or fictional language, or a proper noun.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis following the specified format.
