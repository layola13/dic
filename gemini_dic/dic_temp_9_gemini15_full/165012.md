词源:  The word "prehesitancy" is a relatively rare and somewhat informal neologism.  It's formed by adding the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in anticipation of") to the noun "hesitancy."  The core meaning derives from the verb "hesitate," which has Old French and Latin roots related to "to stand still" or "to pause."  Therefore, "prehesitancy" implies a hesitation that occurs *before* the main action or decision.  It highlights the anticipatory nature of the uncertainty.
