词源:
The word "muse" ultimately derives from the Greek word "Mousa" (Μοῦσα), meaning "muse," one of the nine goddesses of the arts and sciences in Greek mythology.  The goddesses were believed to inspire artists and poets. Over time, the word evolved to describe the act of deep thought and contemplation inspired by such muses.
