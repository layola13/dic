词源:

The word "curiousnesses" derives from the adjective "curious," which comes from the Old French word "curieux," meaning "inquisitive" or "careful." This, in turn, is derived from the Latin word "curiosus,"  meaning "careful," "attentive," or "inquisitive."  The suffix "-ness" is added to form the noun, indicating a state, quality, or condition. The plural "-es" is then added to denote multiple instances of this quality.


用法说明：

"Curiousnesses" is the plural form of "curiousness."  It's less common than "curiosity," but it's grammatically correct and can be used in contexts where you want to emphasize multiple instances of curiosity or unusual traits.  It suggests a collection of individual instances of curiosity or strangeness.


例句:
