词源:

The word is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with "sterilities" (the plural of "sterility"). "Sterility" comes from the Latin word "sterilis," meaning "barren" or "unfruitful."  The "-ity" suffix transforms the adjective "sterile" into a noun. Therefore, "nonsterilities" literally means "the condition of not being sterile."
