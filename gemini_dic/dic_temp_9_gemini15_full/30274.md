cementation: /ˌsɪmɛnˈteɪʃən/ | n. | 胶结；水泥灌浆；硬化 | The process of consolidating or solidifying a material, typically by the deposition of a binding substance in the spaces between its particles.  This is often used in geology to describe the process by which sediment is converted into solid rock, or in engineering to describe the strengthening of materials through the injection of cement or other binding agents. | Example: The cementation of the sandstone layers created a very strong formation.  = 砂岩层的胶结形成了一个非常坚固的地层。 The cementation of the fractured well improved its stability. = 水井裂缝的灌浆提高了其稳定性。 |近义词：consolidation, hardening, solidification | 反义词：disintegration, erosion
