The word "homelily" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage description cannot be provided.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word), a misspelling, or a proper noun (like a brand name).  To provide the requested analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (book, website, conversation, etc.)
* **What was the surrounding text?**  This could help determine the intended meaning.

If you can provide this additional information, I can attempt to offer a possible interpretation and analysis.
