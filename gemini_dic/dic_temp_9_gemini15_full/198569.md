词源：The word "shtetl" comes from the Yiddish word שטעטל (shtetl), which is a diminutive of the German word "Stadt" (city).  It literally means "little town."  The Yiddish word itself reflects the historical context of Jewish communities in Eastern Europe, often residing in smaller settlements rather than major urban centers.
