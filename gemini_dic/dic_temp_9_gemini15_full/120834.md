The word "misaverred" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered this term.
