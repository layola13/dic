The word "contrariantly" derives from the adjective "contrary," which ultimately comes from the Old French "contrarie" and the Latin "contrarius," meaning "opposite" or "against."  The suffix "-ly" is added to transform the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner or way in which something happens.
