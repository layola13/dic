The word "chang" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word?  Please double-check the spelling.  Many words have similar spellings that might be what you intended.

2. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a surname or place name.  Without more context, it's impossible to analyze.

3. **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word from a different language, transliterated into English.  If this is the case, please specify the language of origin.

4. **It's a newly coined word or slang:** It could be a very recent addition to the language or a word used within a specific community or context.

To provide an analysis similar to your example, I need the correct spelling or more context about the word you're interested in.
