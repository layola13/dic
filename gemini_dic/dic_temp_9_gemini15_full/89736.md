hoplight:/ˈhɒplaɪt/| n.| 跳跃灯，（尤指舞台上的）聚光灯 | A hoplight is a spotlight, especially one used on a stage,  that can be easily moved or adjusted to follow a performer.  The name suggests its ability to "hop" or quickly move to different positions.  |例句：The hoplight followed the dancer across the stage.  舞台上的跳跃灯随着舞者移动。


The term "hoplight" is a relatively modern coinage, not found in traditional dictionaries. It's a blend of "hop" (referring to the quick, jumping movement) and "light" (referring to the spotlight). There's no established etymology beyond this blend, as it's a descriptive term rather than a word with a long historical evolution.
