PHRASE->

词源:
The word is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the noun "deliverance," which itself derives from the verb "deliver."  The root of "deliver" is from the Old French "delivrer," ultimately tracing back to the Latin "liberare" (to free, to set free).  Therefore, "nondeliverance" literally means "not a freeing or release" (of goods, services, information, etc.).
