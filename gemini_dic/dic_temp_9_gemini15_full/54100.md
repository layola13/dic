词源:
The word "disembosom" is derived from the Old French word "desembrassier," which means "to unclasp," "to unburden," or "to free from the bosom." The prefix "dis-" indicates removal or separation, and "bosom" refers to the chest or breast, often associated with the heart and innermost feelings.  Therefore, the word literally means "to remove from the bosom," signifying the act of revealing or expressing something deeply held or concealed.
