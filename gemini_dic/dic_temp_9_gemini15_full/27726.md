词源:  The word "canful" is a compound word formed from "can" (a metal container) and "-ful" (a suffix indicating "full of" or "a quantity that fills").  The plural is formed by adding "-s".  The origin of "can" as a container traces back to Old English and Old French words referring to various types of vessels.  "-ful" has Germanic roots.


用法说明:

canfuls is primarily used in informal contexts.  It's not a formal unit of measurement like "liters" or "gallons," but rather a descriptive measure convenient for everyday situations.  It implies a roughly estimated amount rather than a precise quantity.  The use of "canfuls" presupposes that the size of the can is understood within the context.  If different sized cans are involved, it would be ambiguous.
