词源:

The name "Launceston" is derived from the English town of Launceston in Cornwall.  It was named by early British settlers who recognized similarities between the two locations, particularly the river settings.  The name ultimately originates from the Celtic *llan- (meaning "church" or "enclosure") and *stefn (meaning "place").  So, in its roots, it implies a "church place" or "holy place".
