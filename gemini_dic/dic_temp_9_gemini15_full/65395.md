词源:  From  Greek *euphēmós* ("of good omen"), from *eû-* ("well") + *phēmḗ* ("speech, report"). The word evolved through Latin *euphemismus* to its modern English form.  The original meaning referred to using words of good omen to avoid bad luck, which then broadened to encompass the avoidance of unpleasantness through gentler language.
