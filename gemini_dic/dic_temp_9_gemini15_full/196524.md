词源:
The word "servitude" comes from the Old French word "servitude," which in turn derives from the Latin word "servitus," meaning "slavery," "service," or "condition of a slave."  The Latin word is related to "servus," meaning "slave" or "servant."  The concept of servitude has evolved over time, encompassing both the historical meaning of slavery and the more modern legal definition of restricted land use.
