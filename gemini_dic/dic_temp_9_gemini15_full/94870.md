The term "in-bad" is not a recognized English word.  There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a newly coined term, or a phrase specific to a particular context (e.g., slang, jargon).  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this term?** (e.g., a book, a conversation, online)
* **What was the sentence or situation in which it was used?** This will help to understand the intended meaning.

Once you provide this additional information, I can offer a more accurate interpretation and potentially provide a breakdown similar to the example you gave.
