The word "exilent" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established meaning, pronunciation, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure field.
