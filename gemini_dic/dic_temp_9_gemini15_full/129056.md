nitrile:/ˈnaɪtraɪl/| n. |腈；腈纶|A nitrile is an organic compound containing a cyano group (−CN).  Nitriles are important intermediates in organic chemistry, and many nitriles are used in the production of various materials, such as plastics and synthetic fibers.  The term also refers to a synthetic fiber made from acrylonitrile. |Example: Acrylonitrile is a common nitrile used in the production of plastics.  丙烯腈是一种常用腈，用于生产塑料。|近义词:cyanide(though with different implications)|反义词:None specifically|名词
