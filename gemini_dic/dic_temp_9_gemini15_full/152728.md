词源:  Derived from the adjective "peasant," meaning a farmer or laborer of low social status. The adverbial suffix "-ly" is added to form "peasantly," indicating a manner or style.  The word's origins trace back to Old French *paisant, from pais, meaning "country," ultimately from Latin *pagus, also meaning "country" or "village."

用法说明:

"Peasantly" is an adverb that describes actions or manners in a way that is characteristic of peasants. This often implies a lack of refinement, sophistication, or elegance.  It can suggest clumsiness, crudeness, or a lack of social graces.  The connotation is generally negative, implying a judgment about someone's behavior or appearance.  While it can simply describe someone's actions as being like a peasant, it often carries a subtly derogatory tone.
