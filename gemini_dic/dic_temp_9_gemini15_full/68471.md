词源:
Familiarness is derived from the adjective "familiar," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "familier," meaning "belonging to a family," or "domestic."  This, in turn, traces back to the Latin word "familiaris," which also meant "of or belonging to a family."  The suffix "-ness" is an English derivational suffix added to adjectives to form nouns indicating a state, quality, or condition.  Therefore, familiarness describes the state or quality of being familiar.
