nonperceptual: /ˌnɒn.pərˈsɛp.tʃuəl/ | adj. |非知觉的，非感知的 | Not involving or relating to perception or the senses.  It refers to processes or information that are not directly experienced through the five senses (sight, hearing, touch, taste, smell). | Example:  The computer program uses a nonperceptual algorithm to analyze the data.  这个电脑程序使用非感知算法来分析数据。|近义词:unperceived, insensible, unconscious |反义词:perceptual, sensory


USAGE->

将来时:
Future studies will investigate other nonperceptual factors. = 未来的研究将调查其他非感知因素。
We will explore nonperceptual information processing. = 我们将探索非感知信息处理。


虚拟语气:
If the data were nonperceptual, the results would be different. = 如果数据是非感知的，结果将会不同。
It would be helpful if we had a better understanding of nonperceptual processes. = 如果我们对非感知过程有更好的理解，那将会有所帮助。


被动语态:
