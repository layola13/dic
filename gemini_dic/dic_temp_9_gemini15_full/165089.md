The word "preimparts" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need a correctly spelled word or context where you encountered "preimparts".

If you can provide more context (a sentence, paragraph, or the source where you found this word), I can offer suggestions on the intended word and its analysis.
