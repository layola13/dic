The word "leag" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Perhaps "league," "leak," or another word entirely?
* It's a regional dialect word:  It might be used in a specific geographic area or community but not widely known.
* It's a newly coined word or abbreviation:  New words are constantly being created, but without context, it's impossible to know the meaning.
* It's a proper noun:  It might be a name or a place name.


Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you'd like assistance.
