radiational:/ˌreɪdiˈeɪʃənəl/| adj.|辐射的；辐射引起的|Relating to or caused by radiation.  The term often refers to electromagnetic radiation, but can also apply to other forms of radiation such as particle radiation.|例句：The radiational cooling at night caused a significant drop in temperature. 夜间辐射冷却导致气温大幅下降。
例句：The plant showed signs of damage from radiational exposure.  该植物显示出受到辐射照射的损伤迹象。|近义词：irradiative, radiant|反义词：non-radiational


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The radiational effect is significant in this region. = 在这个区域，辐射效应非常显著。
Radiational cooling often occurs at night. = 辐射冷却通常发生在夜间。


一般过去时:
The radiational damage was evident after the explosion. = 爆炸后，辐射损伤很明显。
The experiment measured the radiational output of the device. = 实验测量了该设备的辐射输出。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the effects of radiational exposure on human health. = 科学家们已经研究了辐射暴露对人体健康的影响。
We have observed increased radiational levels in recent years. = 近年来，我们观察到辐射水平有所提高。


过去完成时:
The researchers had already analyzed the radiational data before the conference. = 研究人员在会议之前已经分析了辐射数据。
It had become clear that the radiational burst was the cause of the power outage. = 辐射爆发是造成停电的原因已经很清楚了。


将来时:
The new satellite will monitor radiational levels across the globe. = 新卫星将监测全球的辐射水平。
We will need to consider the potential radiational impact of this project. = 我们需要考虑这个项目的潜在辐射影响。


虚拟语气:
If the radiational levels were higher, we would have to take precautions. = 如果辐射水平更高，我们就必须采取预防措施。
It is crucial that the radiational safety standards are maintained. = 维持辐射安全标准至关重要。


被动语态:
The temperature was affected by radiational cooling. = 气温受到了辐射冷却的影响。
The samples were exposed to intense radiational beams. = 样本暴露在强烈的辐射束中。


疑问句:
Is the radiational heat transfer efficient in this system? = 在这个系统中，辐射热传递效率高吗？
What are the sources of radiational energy in this process? = 在这个过程中，辐射能量的来源是什么？


否定句:
The damage was not caused by radiational exposure. = 损害不是由辐射照射引起的。
The experiment showed no significant radiational effects. = 实验没有显示出明显的辐射效应。


PHRASE->
radiational cooling = 辐射冷却
radiational heating = 辐射加热
radiational energy = 辐射能
radiational transfer = 辐射传递
radiational balance = 辐射平衡
