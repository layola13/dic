isospore:/ˈaɪsoʊspɔːr/| n.|同形孢子|A spore that is morphologically similar to other spores produced by the same organism.  Unlike heterospores, isospores are not differentiated into megaspores and microspores. They are all the same size and shape and have the potential to develop into a gametophyte. | Example: Many ferns produce isospores, which germinate to produce bisexual gametophytes.|近义词：homospore|反义词：heterospore

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The fungus produces isospores. = 这种真菌产生同形孢子。
Plants like ferns rely on isospores for reproduction.=像蕨类植物这样的植物依靠同形孢子进行繁殖。

一般过去时:
The researcher observed the isospores under the microscope.=研究人员在显微镜下观察了同形孢子。
The scientist identified the isospores as belonging to a specific species.=科学家确定这些同形孢子属于特定物种。

现在完成时:
Scientists have studied isospore development extensively. = 科学家们已经广泛研究了同形孢子的发育。
We have found isospores in several soil samples. = 我们在几个土壤样本中发现了同形孢子。

过去完成时:
The spores had already germinated before the analysis began. = 在分析开始之前，孢子就已经萌发了。(虽然例子中用的是spores，但可以替换成isospores，因为同形孢子也是孢子的一种)
The team had collected the isospores samples from a remote location. = 团队已从偏远地区收集了同形孢子样本。


将来时:
We will analyze the isospores using advanced techniques. = 我们将使用先进的技术分析同形孢子。
Researchers will investigate the role of isospores in plant evolution. = 研究人员将调查同形孢子在植物进化中的作用。

虚拟语气:
If the isospores were viable, they would germinate. = 如果同形孢子有活性，它们就会萌发。
It is essential that the isospores be kept in a controlled environment. = 同形孢子必须保存在受控环境中。


被动语态:
The isospores were examined carefully. = 同形孢子被仔细检查。
The samples containing isospores were transported carefully to the laboratory. = 含有同形孢子的样本被小心地运送到实验室。

疑问句:
Are these spores isospores or heterospores? = 这些孢子是同形孢子还是异形孢子？
What conditions are necessary for isospore germination? = 同形孢子萌发需要什么条件？

否定句:
The sample did not contain any isospores. = 样本中不含任何同形孢子。
The plant does not produce isospores; instead, it produces heterospores. = 该植物不产生同形孢子；而是产生异形孢子。


PHRASE->
isospore formation = 同形孢子形成
isospore germination = 同形孢子萌发
isospore morphology = 同形孢子形态
isospore dispersal = 同形孢子传播
isospore development = 同形孢子发育
