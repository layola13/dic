The word "cacadas" is not a word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  If you can provide context (where you saw or heard it), I might be able to help determine the intended word.
* **It's a slang term or neologism:**  It might be a newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or region.  Again, context is crucial.
* **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word from a different language, possibly misspelled.  Knowing the language would help.


Without more information, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis.  Please provide more context.
