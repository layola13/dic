electronegatively:/ˌɪˌlɛktrəʊˌnɛɡəˈtɪvli/ | adv. | 电负性地 |  Describes the tendency of an atom to attract electrons towards itself in a chemical bond.  It indicates the degree to which an atom attracts electrons when it is part of a chemical bond.  A higher electronegativity value means a stronger attraction for electrons. | Example: Oxygen attracts electrons more electronegatively than hydrogen, leading to a polar bond in a water molecule (H₂O). 氧比氢更具有电负性地吸引电子，导致水分子（H₂O）中形成极性键。| 近义词: negatively (in the context of electron attraction) | 反义词: electropositively


USAGE->
This word is an adverb and doesn't have verb conjugations.  It describes how something happens, not an action itself.  Therefore, tense variations are not applicable.


PHRASE->
high electronegativity: 高电负性
low electronegativity: 低电负性
electronegativity difference: 电负性差
electronegativity scale: 电负性标度
Pauling electronegativity:鲍林电负性
