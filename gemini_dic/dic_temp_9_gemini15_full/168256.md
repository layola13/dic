词源:

The term is a compound word. "Pro" comes from Latin, meaning "for" or "in favor of."  "Israel" refers to the modern nation-state of Israel and its historical and religious connections. The term gained prominence during the latter half of the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and increasing global attention to the region.
