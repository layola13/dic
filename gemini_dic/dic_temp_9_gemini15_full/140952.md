词源:

The word is formed by combining "one-sided" (meaning favoring one side only) with the adverbial suffix "-ly".  "One-sided" itself is a compound adjective formed from "one" and "sided," referring to having only one side or aspect.  The origin of "one" is Old English *ān, and "side" comes from Old English *sīde, meaning "side, edge, border".  The suffix "-ly" is a common adverbial suffix in English, deriving from Old English -lice.
