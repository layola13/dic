词源:

The word "improsperity" is formed from the prefix "im-" (meaning "not") and the noun "prosperity."  "Prosperity" itself comes from the Old French "prosperite," ultimately derived from the Latin "prosperitas," meaning "success, good fortune."  Therefore, "improsperity" literally means "not prospering" or the lack of prosperity.
