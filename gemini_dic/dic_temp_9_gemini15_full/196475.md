Etymology:

The word "servanthood" is a relatively modern noun formed from the older word "servant" and the suffix "-hood."

* **Servant:**  This word has Old English roots, ultimately deriving from the Proto-Germanic *serwaniz, meaning "one who serves."  This reflects the core meaning of service and subordination.

* **-hood:** This suffix is a common English suffix that forms nouns indicating state, condition, or quality.  It is affixed to nouns to create abstract nouns denoting a particular state or character,  such as childhood, womanhood, brotherhood, etc.


Therefore, "servanthood" literally signifies the "state or quality of being a servant," but it's evolved to encompass a broader meaning than mere servitude.  It often suggests a humble and selfless dedication to serving others, often with a spiritual or moral connotation.
