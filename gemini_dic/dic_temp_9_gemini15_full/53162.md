dipoles:/ˈdaɪpoʊlz/| n.|偶极子，双极子 |A dipole is an object with two oppositely charged poles, such as a magnet with a north and south pole, or a molecule with a positive and negative end.  |例句：Water molecules are dipoles, with a slightly positive hydrogen end and a slightly negative oxygen end. 水分子是偶极子，具有略带正电的氢端和略带负电的氧端。|例句：The magnetic dipole moment of the atom was measured. 原子的磁偶极矩被测量了。|近义词：double pole, bipolar |反义词：monopoles


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The water molecules act as dipoles. = 水分子充当偶极子。
