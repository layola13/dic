词源:
The word "overspeeded" is formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much") to the past participle "speeded" (or "sped") of the verb "speed."  The root word "speed" itself has Old English origins, ultimately deriving from words related to "success" or "prosperity," reflecting the original sense of swift progress.
