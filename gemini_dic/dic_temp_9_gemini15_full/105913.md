The word "kiver" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "cover," "cumber," or another word entirely.  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **It's a dialect word or slang:** It might be used informally in a specific region or community, but not widely understood.

3. **It's a newly coined word or a proper noun:**  It could be a neologism (newly invented word) or a name (e.g., a brand name).


Without knowing the intended word, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  If you can provide the correct spelling or more context, I'd be happy to help.
