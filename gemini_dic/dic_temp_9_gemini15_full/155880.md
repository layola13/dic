photoact:/ˈfoʊtoʊækt/ | n. |光活化；光致反应|The process by which a molecule absorbs light and undergoes a chemical change.  This often involves a change in the molecule's electronic state, leading to further reactions.  Photoactivation is crucial in many biological processes and technological applications.|Example: The photoact of rhodopsin in the eye allows us to see. 光感受器中的光活化作用使我们能够看见。|近义词：photoactivation, light activation|反义词：N/A
