词源：

The word "nonfascist" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "fascist," which derives from Italian "fascista," relating to the Fascist Party of Italy.  The term "fascist" itself originates from the Latin word "fasces," referring to a bundle of rods with an axe, a symbol of authority in ancient Rome.  The modern political meaning developed in the 20th century with the rise of Fascism.
