nonaseptically: /ˌnɒnəˈsɛptɪkli/ | adv. | 非无菌地，非无菌性地 |  Not in a sterile manner; without using aseptic techniques.  The procedure was performed nonaseptically, increasing the risk of infection. | 近义词：unsterilely, unsanitarily | 反义词：aseptically, sterily

词源：

* **non-**:  prefix meaning "not"
* **aseptically**:  adverb form of "aseptic," meaning free from contamination by harmful microorganisms.  Aseptic itself derives from "a-" (without) + "septic" (related to sepsis or putrefaction).


用法说明：

nonaseptically  is primarily used in medical and scientific contexts to describe procedures or conditions that are not performed or maintained in a sterile environment, thereby increasing the risk of infection or contamination.  It emphasizes the lack of adherence to aseptic techniques.
