The word "pokal" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a word from another language, possibly German.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full etymological analysis and usage examples in the requested format.  To help you, I need the language of origin.  If you provide the language, I can attempt to provide a translation, etymology, and usage examples.
