pandiatonic: /ˌpænˌdaɪəˈtɒnɪk/ | adj. | 全音阶的，七音音阶的 |  Pertaining to or characterized by the use of all seven notes of a diatonic scale within a given musical passage or composition.  This often implies a less traditional or more chromatic approach than typical diatonic harmony.  | Example: The composer's style is notable for its frequent use of pandiatonic melodies, blurring the lines between major and minor tonalities.  作曲家的风格以其频繁使用全音阶旋律而著称，模糊了大调和小调的界限。 | 近义词:heptatonic (referring to the seven-note structure) | 反义词:diatonic (in a contrasting sense, implying adherence to a specific diatonic scale)


词源:
The word is a combination of "pan-" (meaning "all" or "every") and "diatonic" (referring to a seven-note scale with specific intervals).  Thus, "pandiatonic" literally means "all diatonic" or encompassing all the notes of a diatonic scale.
