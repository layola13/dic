/ˌnɒnˈprɒbəbli/ | adj. | 不太可能地，大概不会 |  The word "nonprobably" is not a standard English word. It's a non-standard combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "probably" (meaning "likely").  While understandable in context, its use should be avoided in formal writing.  It implies a degree of unlikelihood stronger than "improbable" but less absolute than "impossible". |  The rain will nonprobably stop today. = 今天雨大概不会停。   |近义词: improbably, unlikely |反义词: probably, likely | 形容词
