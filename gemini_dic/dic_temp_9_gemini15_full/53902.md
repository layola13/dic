词源:
The word "discountable" is derived from the verb "discount," which ultimately comes from Old French *descompter (dis- + compter, "to count").  The "dis-" prefix indicates removal or negation, while "compter" relates to calculation or accounting.  Therefore, "discount" originally meant to deduct from a sum. The suffix "-able" makes it an adjective meaning "capable of being discounted."
