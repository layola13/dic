inoculability:/ˌɪnɒkjʊˈlæbɪləti/ | n. | 可接种性；易感染性 | The ability of a microorganism to be inoculated or introduced into a host.  This refers to the ease with which a pathogen can be introduced into a susceptible host and establish an infection.  It encompasses factors related to both the pathogen and the host. | Example: The high inoculability of the virus contributed to the rapid spread of the epidemic.  高病毒的接种性导致了疫情的迅速蔓延。The inoculability of the bacteria was tested in various environments.  细菌的接种性在不同的环境中进行了测试。 |近义词：infectivity, transmissibility | 反义词：resistance, immunity


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The high inoculability of this strain worries scientists. = 这种菌株的高接种性让科学家们担忧。
Its inoculability is being studied extensively. = 它的接种性正在被广泛研究。


一般过去时:
The inoculability of the virus was unexpectedly high. = 该病毒的接种性出乎意料地高。
Scientists studied the inoculability of the bacteria. = 科学家们研究了细菌的接种性。


现在完成时:
Researchers have determined the inoculability of the new pathogen. = 研究人员已经确定了这种新病原体的接种性。
Scientists have questioned the inoculability results. = 科学家们对接种性结果提出了质疑。


过去完成时:
They had already assessed the inoculability before the trial. = 他们在试验之前就已经评估了接种性。
We had underestimated the inoculability of the disease. = 我们低估了这种疾病的易感性。


将来时:

疑问句:
What is the inoculability of this particular bacteria? = 这种特定细菌的接种性是多少？
Does the inoculability vary across different strains? = 不同菌株的接种性是否不同？


否定句:
The inoculability of the vaccine was not as high as expected. = 疫苗的接种性并不像预期的那样高。
They found that the inoculability was negligible in that environment. = 他们发现该环境下的接种性可以忽略不计。


PHRASE->
