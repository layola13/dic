词源:
The word "hypophosphite" is derived from "hypophosphorous acid,"  which combines "hypo-" (meaning "under" or "less than"), "phosphorus" (the chemical element), and "-ous" (indicating an acid).  The "-ite" suffix indicates a salt of the acid.  Therefore, hypophosphite refers to a salt derived from an acid with a lower oxidation state of phosphorus than phosphorous acid.
