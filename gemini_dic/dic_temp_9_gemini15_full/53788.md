词源:

The word "discomposedness" is derived from the verb "discompose," which itself is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the verb "compose," meaning "to put together" or "to calm."  Therefore, "discompose" means "to disturb" or "to unsettle," and "discomposedness" is the noun form indicating the state of being disturbed or unsettled.  The suffix "-ness" is a common noun-forming suffix in English, indicating a state, quality, or condition.


用法说明：

Discomposedness is primarily used to describe a state of mental or emotional disturbance. It implies a loss of composure or self-control due to some unsettling event or situation.  It is less common than some of its synonyms but adds a slightly more formal and literary tone to the writing.  It's generally used in more formal contexts than simpler words like "anxiety" or "nervousness."
