词源:
The word "deporter" is derived from the verb "deport," which comes from the Old French word "deporter," meaning "to carry away," "to remove," or "to banish."  The Old French word itself has roots in the Latin word "deportare,"  a combination of "de-" (away from) and "portare" (to carry).  Therefore, "deporter" literally means "one who carries away" or "one who removes."
