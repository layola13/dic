hydrofluorocarbon:/ˌhaɪdroʊˌflʊəroʊˈkɑːrbən/ | n. |氢氟烃 |Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are chemical compounds containing hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon. They are used as refrigerants, propellants, and solvents.  HFCs are potent greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change.  They are often used as replacements for ozone-depleting substances like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs).|The increasing use of hydrofluorocarbons in refrigeration systems is a cause for concern regarding global warming.|近义词:refrigerant, propellant|反义词: (no direct antonym, but substances with low global warming potential could be considered a contrasting concept)|名词
