farad:/ˈfærəd/| n. |法拉(电容单位)|The farad (symbol: F) is the SI derived unit of electrical capacitance.  It is defined as the capacitance across which, when charged with one coulomb, there is a potential difference of one volt.  In simpler terms, it measures a capacitor's ability to store electrical charge. |The capacitor has a capacitance of one farad. = 这个电容器的电容为一法拉。
A farad is a very large unit of capacitance;  microfarads (µF) and picofarads (pF) are more commonly used. = 法拉是一个很大的电容单位；微法拉（µF）和皮法拉（pF）更常用。|microfarad, picofarad|henry (inductance)|noun
