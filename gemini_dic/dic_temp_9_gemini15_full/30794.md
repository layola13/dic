The word "cetic" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Possible candidates depending on context could include "skeptic," "septic," or even a proper noun.

2. **A neologism or technical term:** It could be a newly coined word or a term used within a specific field or community.  If this is the case, please provide more context so I can assist you further.

3. **A word from another language:**  It could be a word borrowed from another language.  If so, please specify the language.
