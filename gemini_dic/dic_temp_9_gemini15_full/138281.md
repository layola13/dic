WORD ORIGIN->
The word "notarize" comes from "notary," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "notarius," meaning "writer," "secretary," or "shorthand writer."  Notaries were originally scribes who recorded legal proceedings.  The suffix "-ize" is a common verb-forming suffix indicating to make or become something.
