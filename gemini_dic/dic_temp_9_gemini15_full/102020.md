isogonism:/aɪˈsɒɡənɪzəm/ | n. | 等角现象，等角性 | The similarity in the angles of crystals of different substances.  Isogonism refers to the phenomenon where different chemical compounds crystallize in the same crystal system and exhibit similar interfacial angles. This similarity in angles, despite differences in chemical composition, is often indicative of a structural relationship between the compounds. | Example: The isogonism between certain sulfates and selenates was a key observation in early crystallography. 等角现象，例如某些硫酸盐和硒酸盐之间的等角性，是早期晶体学中的一个关键观察结果。| 近义词: isomorphism (in a broader sense) | 反义词:  anisogonism (lack of similar angles) |  名词
