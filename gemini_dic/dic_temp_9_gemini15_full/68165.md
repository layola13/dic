词源:  From Old French *faineant, present participle of faindre "to feign, to sham," from Vulgar Latin *fingere, related to Latin fingere "to fashion, shape, feign."  The original meaning referred to someone who feigned illness or incapacity to avoid work.  Over time, the meaning shifted to simply "lazy."
