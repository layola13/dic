词源:
The word "galvanize" ultimately derives from the name of Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), an Italian physician and physicist. Galvani's experiments on frog legs, which appeared to show that electricity could stimulate muscle contractions, led to the development of the science of electrophysiology.  The original meaning of "galvanize" was related to this electrical stimulation. Over time, the meaning broadened to include the stimulation of any kind of activity or response.  The use of zinc coating, also known as galvanizing, similarly derives from Galvani's work and the use of electricity in the process.
