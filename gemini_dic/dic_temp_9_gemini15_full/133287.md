词源:

The word "nonexpedient" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "expedient."  "Expedient" comes from the Latin word "expedire," which means "to disentangle, to free, to extricate," implying something that helps to achieve a goal efficiently.  Over time, "expedient" evolved to mean something that is convenient or advantageous, even if not necessarily morally right.  Therefore, "nonexpedient" denotes the opposite: something that is *not* convenient, advantageous, or suitable.
