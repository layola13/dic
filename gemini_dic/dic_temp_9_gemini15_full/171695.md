pulvinar:/pʌlˈvɪnɑːr/| n. |丘脑枕部；枕核 |A large, egg-shaped structure in the thalamus of the brain, involved in visual processing and other functions.  It plays a crucial role in attention, visual awareness, and eye movements. | The pulvinar is a complex structure with multiple subnuclei that have distinct connections and functions.  Researchers are still uncovering its many roles in brain function. |  近义词：thalamic nucleus (a broader term)| 反义词：None directly applicable.


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The pulvinar plays a key role in visual attention. = 丘脑枕部在视觉注意力中起着关键作用。
Damage to the pulvinar can impair visual processing. = 丘脑枕部的损伤会损害视觉处理。


一般过去时:
Researchers studied the pulvinar's role in spatial awareness. = 研究人员研究了丘脑枕部在空间意识中的作用。
Scientists investigated the pulvinar's connections to other brain areas. = 科学家调查了丘脑枕部与大脑其他区域的联系。


现在完成时:
Studies have shown the pulvinar's involvement in eye movement control. = 研究表明丘脑枕部参与了眼球运动控制。
Scientists have identified several subnuclei within the pulvinar. = 科学家已经确定了丘脑枕部内的几个子核。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had already mapped the pulvinar's anatomical structure. = 在实验之前，他们已经绘制了丘脑枕部的解剖结构图。
Researchers had hypothesized that the pulvinar played a role in attention before confirming it. = 在证实之前，研究人员假设丘脑枕部在注意力中发挥作用。


将来时:

It is hypothesized that if the pulvinar functioned differently, attention would be affected. = 假设如果丘脑枕部功能不同，注意力就会受到影响。


被动语态:
The pulvinar's role in visual attention is being extensively studied. = 丘脑枕部在视觉注意力中的作用正在被广泛研究。
The pulvinar's connections to the cortex were mapped using advanced imaging techniques. = 丘脑枕部与皮层的连接是使用先进的成像技术绘制的。


疑问句:
What is the exact function of the pulvinar in visual awareness? = 丘脑枕部在视觉意识中的确切功能是什么？
How does damage to the pulvinar affect cognitive performance? = 丘脑枕部的损伤如何影响认知能力？


否定句:
The pulvinar is not solely responsible for all aspects of visual processing. = 丘脑枕部并非完全负责视觉处理的所有方面。
The study did not find a direct correlation between pulvinar activity and specific behavioral responses. = 该研究没有发现丘脑枕部活动与特定行为反应之间的直接相关性。


PHRASE->
pulvinar nucleus = 丘脑枕核
