/ɛmˈɛs/|abbr.|毫秒, 毫秒级|millisecond; a thousandth of a second|The program executed in under 100 ms.  程序在100毫秒内执行完毕。|  |  |abbr.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The process takes 50 ms. = 这个过程需要50毫秒。
The signal lasts 10 ms. = 信号持续10毫秒。

一般过去时:
The response time was 20 ms. = 响应时间为20毫秒。
It took 100 ms to load the page. = 加载页面用了100毫秒。

现在完成时:
The system has responded in under 10 ms. = 系统在10毫秒内做出了响应。
It has consistently performed within 20 ms. = 它一直保持在20毫秒以内。

过去完成时:
The event had completed in less than 5 ms before the alarm triggered. = 在警报触发之前，事件已在不到5毫秒的时间内完成。
The process had already finished its 10 ms cycle. = 该过程已完成其10毫秒的周期。

将来时:
The update will complete in under 50 ms. = 更新将在50毫秒内完成。
The system will respond within 1 ms. = 系统将在1毫秒内做出响应。

虚拟语气:
If the response time were under 10 ms, the system would be considered efficient. = 如果响应时间低于10毫秒，则系统将被认为是高效的。
I wish the program could execute in less than 1 ms. = 我希望程序能够在不到1毫秒的时间内执行。

被动语态:
The task was completed in 20 ms. = 任务在20毫秒内完成。
The data was processed in less than 100 ms. = 数据在不到100毫秒的时间内得到处理。

疑问句:
How many ms did the operation take? = 此操作用了多少毫秒？
What is the average response time in ms? = 平均响应时间是多少毫秒？

否定句:
The program did not complete within 10 ms. = 程序未在10毫秒内完成。
The system did not respond in less than 50 ms. = 系统未在50毫秒内响应。


PHRASE->
10 ms latency = 10毫秒延迟
50 ms response time = 50毫秒响应时间
under 100 ms = 在100毫秒以内
average ms = 平均毫秒
peak ms = 峰值毫秒
