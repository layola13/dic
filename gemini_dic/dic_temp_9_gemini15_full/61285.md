词源:
From "embalm," which comes from the Old French "embaumer," meaning "to perfume" or "to embalm."  This in turn derives from the prefix "en-" (in, into) and "baume" (balm).  The original sense was thus to treat a body with fragrant substances, which evolved into the modern meaning of preservation.
