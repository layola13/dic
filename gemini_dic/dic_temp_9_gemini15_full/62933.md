The word "enmist" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It may be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific jargon or dialect, or a proper noun.  More context is needed to understand its intended meaning and provide a proper analysis.
