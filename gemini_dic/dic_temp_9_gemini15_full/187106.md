词源:
The word "rivulet" comes from the Old French word "rivulet," which in turn derives from the Late Latin word "rivulārius," meaning "of or pertaining to a rivus."  "Rivus" itself is a Late Latin word meaning "stream" or "brook," ultimately of unknown origin but possibly related to Proto-Italic roots.
