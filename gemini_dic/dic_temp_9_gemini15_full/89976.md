词源:

The word "horsewhipping" is a compound word.  "Horsewhip" combines "horse" (referring to the type of whip used) and "whip" (the act of striking). The "-ing" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, denoting the act of horsewhipping.  Its origins are in the use of a long whip specifically designed for controlling horses, later adapted for punishment.
