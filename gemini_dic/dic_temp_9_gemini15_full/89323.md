词源:

From "homo-" (same, similar) + "-genetic" (related to origin or generation).  The prefix "homo-" derives from the Greek word "homos" meaning "same," and "-genetic" is derived from the Greek word "genesis" meaning "origin" or "creation."  Therefore, "homogenetic" literally means "of the same origin."
