The word "rashem" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  There is no pronunciation, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or etymology available for a word that does not exist.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a word from a specific dialect or jargon, or a neologism (newly coined word).  If you could provide more context or clarify the spelling, I may be able to offer assistance.
