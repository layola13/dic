词源:  The word "siloed" derives from the noun "silo," which originally referred to a tall cylindrical structure used for storing grain.  The metaphorical extension to describe isolated systems comes from the idea of grain being kept separate and inaccessible in its silo.  The verb "silo" (to place in a silo, to isolate) then gave rise to the adjective "siloed".
