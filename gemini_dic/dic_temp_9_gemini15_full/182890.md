词源:
The word "repercussiveness" is derived from the noun "repercussion," which in turn comes from the French word "répercussion," meaning "a rebounding or reverberation."  The "-ive" suffix transforms the noun into an adjective, indicating the quality or tendency to have repercussions.  The ultimate origin can be traced to the Latin verb "percutere," meaning "to strike through."
