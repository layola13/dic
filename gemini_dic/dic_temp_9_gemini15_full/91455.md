hygroscopicity:/ˌhaɪɡroʊskɒˈpɪsəti/| n.|吸湿性|The ability of a substance to attract and hold water molecules from the surrounding environment.  This property is often due to the presence of hydrophilic groups within the substance's structure.  Hygroscopicity can lead to changes in the physical properties of a material, such as swelling, shrinking, or changes in viscosity.|例句：The hygroscopicity of salt makes it useful as a desiccant. 盐的吸湿性使其可用作干燥剂。

The high hygroscopicity of wood can cause it to warp and crack in dry conditions.木材的高吸湿性会导致它在干燥条件下翘曲和开裂。|近义词：water absorption, moisture absorption, deliquescence (for extreme cases)|反义词：hydrophobicity
