词源:  The word "exhibitory" is derived from the verb "exhibit," which comes from the Latin word "exhibere," meaning "to hold forth," "to offer," or "to present."  The suffix "-ory" forms adjectives meaning "of the nature of" or "relating to." Therefore, "exhibitory" means "relating to the act of exhibiting."
