insphere:/ˈɪnspɪər/| n.|内切球，内接球|A sphere that is tangent to each face of a polyhedron.  It is the largest sphere that can be contained within the polyhedron.|例句：The insphere of a regular tetrahedron is located at the centroid.|近义词：inscribed sphere|反义词：circumsphere


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The insphere touches each face of the cube. = 内切球与立方体的每个面相切。
The insphere's radius is half the edge length. = 内切球的半径是边长的一半。


一般过去时:
We calculated the volume of the insphere. = 我们计算了内切球的体积。
The insphere was found to be perfectly centered. = 发现内切球完全居中。


现在完成时:
Scientists have determined the insphere's properties. = 科学家们已经确定了内切球的特性。
They have successfully constructed the insphere model. = 他们已经成功地构建了内切球模型。


过去完成时:
Before the calculation, we had assumed the insphere's radius. = 在计算之前，我们假设了内切球的半径。
They had already found the insphere's center before the measurement. = 他们在测量之前就已经找到了内切球的中心。


将来时:
We will compute the insphere's surface area. = 我们将计算内切球的表面积。
The software will automatically generate the insphere. = 该软件将自动生成内切球。


虚拟语气:
If the polyhedron were regular, the insphere would be easy to find. = 如果多面体是正多面体，那么内切球就很容易找到。
I wish I knew the exact radius of the insphere. = 我真希望知道内切球的确切半径。


被动语态:
The insphere's volume was calculated using a formula. = 内切球的体积是用公式计算的。
The insphere is being studied for its geometric properties. = 正在研究内切球的几何特性。


疑问句:
What is the radius of the insphere? = 内切球的半径是多少？
How is the insphere constructed for a given polyhedron? = 给定一个多面体，如何构建它的内切球？


否定句:
The sphere is not an insphere of the given polyhedron. = 这个球不是给定多面体的内切球。
The insphere does not always exist for irregular polyhedra. = 不规则多面体并不总是有内切球。


PHRASE->
insphere radius = 内切球半径
insphere volume = 内切球体积
insphere center = 内切球中心
calculate the insphere = 计算内切球
find the insphere = 找到内切球
