polyion: /ˈpɒliˌaɪɒn/ | n. |聚离子|A polyion is a large ion, typically a molecule or macromolecule, that carries multiple charges of the same sign.  These charges can be either positive (polycation) or negative (polyanion).  They are commonly found in solutions and play crucial roles in various chemical and biological processes.|Example:  DNA is a polyanion due to the negative charges on its phosphate backbone. DNA是一个聚阴离子，因为其磷酸骨架上带负电荷。|近义词: macromolecular ion, multicharged ion|反义词:monomer, simple ion|名词
