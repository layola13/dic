词源:
The word "documenting" comes from the noun "document," which originates from the Old French word "document," meaning "something that provides evidence."  The Old French word, in turn, derives from the Latin word "documenta," the plural of "documentum," meaning "lesson, instruction, evidence."  The suffix "-ing" indicates the present participle, transforming the noun into a verb describing the action of creating or using documents.
