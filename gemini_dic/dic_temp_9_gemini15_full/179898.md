词源：
The word "refamiliarization" is a relatively modern coinage.  It's formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") to "familiarization," which itself derives from "familiar" (from Old French *familier, ultimately from Latin *familiaris, "belonging to a family"). The "-ization" suffix indicates the process of making something familiar.
