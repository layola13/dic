dicarbonic: /ˌdaɪkɑːrˈbɒnɪk/ | adj. | 二碳的；含两个羰基的 | Relating to or containing two carbonyl groups.  The term is primarily used in organic chemistry to describe molecules with two carbonyl groups.  It's less common than other, more specific terms for compounds with two carbonyl groups depending on their arrangement. |


例句：

The synthesis of dicarbonic acids involves the oxidation of suitable precursors.  = 二元羧酸的合成涉及合适前体的氧化。

The molecule exhibits unique properties due to the presence of its dicarbonic structure. =  由于其二羰基结构的存在，该分子表现出独特的性质。


近义词：  There isn't a perfect single synonym, as the best term depends on the specific molecule.  Terms like "dicarboxyl" might be used if the carbonyl groups are part of carboxylic acid groups.  More specific terms describing the arrangement of the carbonyls (e.g., 1,2-diketo, 1,3-diketo) would be more appropriate in many cases.


反义词：  No direct antonym exists.  The opposite would imply a lack of carbonyl groups.


词性：形容词
