cell-like:/ˈsɛlˌlaɪk/| adj. |细胞状的，类似细胞的 |Resembling a cell or cells in structure or function.  This term often describes structures or organisms that exhibit characteristics similar to biological cells, such as having a membrane-bound compartment or performing cell-like processes.  |Example:  The protein aggregates formed a cell-like structure.  蛋白质聚集体形成了一种类似细胞的结构。 The researcher observed cell-like compartments within the synthetic material. 研究人员在合成材料中观察到类似细胞的隔室。 |近义词：cell-shaped, cellular, compartmentalized |反义词：acellular, non-cellular


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The structure is cell-like in appearance. = 该结构外观呈细胞状。
These compartments function in a cell-like manner. = 这些隔室以类似细胞的方式运作。


一般过去时:
The scientists observed cell-like structures under the microscope. = 科学家在显微镜下观察到细胞状结构。
The experiment demonstrated cell-like behavior in the synthetic system. = 实验证明了该合成系统中类似细胞的行为。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified many cell-like structures in various materials. = 研究人员已在各种材料中鉴定出许多类似细胞的结构。
Scientists have observed cell-like organization in certain non-living systems. = 科学家在某些非生命系统中观察到类似细胞的组织。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, no one had envisioned such complex cell-like formations. = 在这项发现之前，没有人设想过如此复杂的细胞状结构。
They had already observed similar cell-like features in previous experiments. = 他们在之前的实验中已经观察到类似的细胞状特征。


将来时:
Scientists will continue to investigate cell-like structures in artificial systems. = 科学家将继续研究人工系统中的细胞状结构。
Further research will reveal more about the cell-like properties of these materials. = 进一步的研究将揭示这些材料更多类似细胞的特性。


虚拟语气:
If these structures were truly cell-like, they would exhibit certain key characteristics. = 如果这些结构确实是细胞状的，它们将表现出某些关键特征。
It is unlikely that these structures would function in a perfectly cell-like manner. = 这些结构不太可能以完全类似细胞的方式运作。


被动语态:
Cell-like structures were observed in the samples. = 在样品中观察到细胞状结构。
The cell-like organization of the material was confirmed by microscopy. = 通过显微镜确认了该材料的细胞状组织。


疑问句:
Are these structures truly cell-like? = 这些结构真的是细胞状的吗？
Do these findings suggest the possibility of creating artificial cell-like systems? = 这些发现是否暗示了创造人工细胞状系统的可能性？


否定句:
The aggregates were not completely cell-like in their organization. = 这些聚集体的组织并非完全类似细胞。
The observed structures did not exhibit all the characteristics of cell-like entities. = 观察到的结构并没有表现出所有类似细胞的实体的特征。


PHRASE->
cell-like structures = 细胞状结构
cell-like compartments = 类似细胞的隔室
cell-like behavior = 类似细胞的行为
cell-like organization = 类似细胞的组织
cell-like morphology = 类似细胞的形态
