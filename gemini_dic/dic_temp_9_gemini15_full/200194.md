skinhead:/ˈskɪnhed/| n. |光头党；光头族 |A skinhead is a member of a subculture, originally associated with working-class youth in Britain in the 1960s, characterized by shaved heads and a particular style of clothing.  Skinhead subcultures have varied widely in their political affiliations, from far-right extremism to anti-racist and anti-fascist stances.  The term can be used neutrally to describe someone with a shaved head, but it often carries negative connotations due to the association with violent extremist groups. |Example:  He was mistaken for a skinhead because of his shaved head. 他因为光头而被误认为是光头党。

The term "skinhead" arose in the 1960s in Britain, referring to working-class youth who adopted a distinctive style including shaved heads, often inspired by West Indian rude boys.  Over time, however, the skinhead subculture became associated with various political ideologies, including far-right extremism, leading to negative connotations.  The original skinhead style and its later iterations have influenced fashion and music.
