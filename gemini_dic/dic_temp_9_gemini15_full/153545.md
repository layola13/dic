pentadelphous: /ˌpɛntəˈdɛlfəs/ | adj. | 五体雄蕊的 | Having five stamens united by their filaments.  This term is used in botany to describe flowers with five stamens whose filaments are fused together.  The term is derived from the Greek words "penta" (five) and "adelphos" (brother), referring to the five stamens being joined together like brothers.


例句：

The flower exhibited pentadelphous stamens, a characteristic feature of the species. = 这朵花展现出五体雄蕊，这是该物种的特征。

Many species in the family Malvaceae display pentadelphous androecium. = 锦葵科的许多物种都具有五体雄蕊。


近义词：  There aren't direct synonyms, as this is a very specific botanical term.  Descriptions like "having fused stamens" or "with united filaments" might be used instead.

反义词：  "Polyadelphous" (stamens united into more than two bundles) could be considered a contrasting term, though not a direct antonym.  "Diadelphous" (stamens united in two bundles) and "monadelphous" (stamens united in one bundle) also represent different arrangements of stamens.
