preharmoniously: /ˌpriːhɑːrˈmoʊniəsli/ | adj. | 预先和谐地；和谐地提前 |  This word is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, meaning a newly coined word or expression.  It appears to be formed by combining "pre-" (before) and "harmoniously" (in a harmonious way).  Therefore, it suggests a state of harmony that exists before a particular event or situation. However, its lack of established usage means there are no standard definitions, examples, synonyms, or antonyms.  Because it's not a recognized word, providing grammatical examples is inappropriate.  The word would need to be defined within a specific context by the author using it.
