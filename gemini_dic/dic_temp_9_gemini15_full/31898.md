The word "cheeselep" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism, a made-up word, a misspelling, or a word from a very niche context.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  To provide such an analysis, I would need a word that actually exists.
