The word "duyoung" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (perhaps a name or place), a word from a specific dialect or jargon, or a newly coined word not yet widely adopted.  To provide an analysis, more context is needed.
