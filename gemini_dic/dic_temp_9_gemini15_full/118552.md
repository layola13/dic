mesophloeum:/ˈmɛzoʊfloʊəm/| n.|中皮层|The mesophloeum is the middle layer of bark in certain plants, lying between the inner and outer bark.  It's a relatively less-studied layer compared to the other bark layers and its specific composition and function vary depending on the plant species.|Example:  The research paper focused on the anatomical structure of the mesophloeum in Eucalyptus trees.|近义词: secondary phloem (partially, as mesophloeum is a specific part of the secondary phloem)|反义词:  None directly applicable, as it refers to a specific anatomical location.|名词
