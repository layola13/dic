词源:

The word "nobby" ultimately derives from the Old Norse word "knúpr," meaning "knot" or "knob."  Through a series of linguistic shifts and changes in meaning, it evolved to describe something compact, sturdy, or well-made, eventually arriving at its modern sense of being stylish and fashionable.  The association with wealth and upper-class status likely developed because finely crafted and well-made items were more readily accessible to the wealthy.
