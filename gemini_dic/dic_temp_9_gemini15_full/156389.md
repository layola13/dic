physoclisti: /ˌfɪzoʊˈklɪsti/ | n. |  闭鳔类鱼 |  Physoclisti is a suborder of ray-finned fishes characterized by a closed swim bladder that is not connected to the esophagus.  This contrasts with physostomes, which have an open connection.  The closed swim bladder allows for better control of buoyancy. | Example: Many commercially important fishes, such as cod and tuna, belong to the physoclisti.  许多重要的商业鱼类，如鳕鱼和金枪鱼，都属于闭鳔类。| 近义词: none (this is a taxonomic group, not a descriptive term) | 反义词: Physostomi (open-bladdered fishes) |  名词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The physoclisti control their buoyancy with their closed swim bladders. = 闭鳔类鱼通过封闭的鳔来控制它们的浮力。
Many species of physoclisti inhabit the deep ocean. = 许多闭鳔类鱼生活在深海。


一般过去时:
Scientists classified these fish as physoclisti. = 科学家将这些鱼归类为闭鳔类。
The study examined the evolutionary history of physoclisti. = 这项研究考察了闭鳔类的进化史。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified many new species of physoclisti. = 研究人员已经发现了许多新的闭鳔类物种。
We have learned a great deal about the physiology of physoclisti. = 我们已经了解了很多关于闭鳔类生理学的知识。


过去完成时:
Before the study, little was known about the deep-sea physoclisti. = 在这项研究之前，人们对深海闭鳔类知之甚少。
They had already categorized most of the known physoclisti. = 他们已经对大多数已知的闭鳔类进行了分类。


将来时:
Scientists will continue to study the physoclisti. = 科学家们将继续研究闭鳔类。
Further research will illuminate the evolutionary relationships of physoclisti. = 进一步的研究将阐明闭鳔类的进化关系。


虚拟语气:
If these fish were physostomes, their buoyancy control would be different. = 如果这些鱼是开口鳔类，它们的浮力控制就会不同。
It is likely that if more research were conducted, more physoclisti species would be discovered. = 如果进行更多的研究，很可能会发现更多的闭鳔类物种。


被动语态:
Physoclisti are classified based on their swim bladder morphology. = 闭鳔类是根据它们的鳔形态进行分类的。
The evolutionary relationships of physoclisti are being actively investigated. = 闭鳔类的进化关系正在积极研究中。


疑问句:
Are all deep-sea fish physoclisti? = 所有深海鱼都是闭鳔类吗？
To what extent do physoclisti rely on their swim bladders for buoyancy? = 闭鳔类在多大程度上依赖它们的鳔来控制浮力？


否定句:
Not all ray-finned fishes are physoclisti. = 并非所有辐鳍鱼都是闭鳔类。
These species are not considered physoclisti. = 这些物种不被认为是闭鳔类。
