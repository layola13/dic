self-subjugating: /ˌsɛlfˈsʌbdʒʊɡeɪtɪŋ/ | adj. | 自我征服的；自我克制的 |  Describing something or someone that brings itself under control or domination; that imposes restraints or discipline upon itself. This term often implies a degree of internal conflict or struggle before achieving self-mastery. It suggests a proactive, rather than passive, submission.


英文解析:The word combines "self" (oneself) with "subjugating" (bringing under domination or control).  Therefore, "self-subjugating" describes a process or entity that actively subdues or controls itself.  It's not simply passive obedience but an act of will.
