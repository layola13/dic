词源:

The word "magniloquent" comes from the Latin words "magnus" (great, large) and "loquens" (speaking).  The prefix "magn-" contributes to the sense of grandeur or greatness, while "-loquent" relates to speaking or expression.  Therefore, the word literally means "greatly speaking" or "speaking grandly".
