词源：源自escape (v.) + -ingly (adv. suffix).  "escape" comes from Old French *eschaper, from Vulgar Latin *excappare "to slip away," from Latin ex- "out" + cappa "cloak, cape." The sense development reflects the idea of something slipping away from control or confinement.  The suffix "-ingly" forms adverbs of manner.
