词源:
The word "slipperiest" is the superlative form of the adjective "slippery," which comes from the Middle English word "sliperi," meaning "slippery."  This, in turn, is derived from the Old English word "sliprig," which combines "slip" (to slide) and the suffix "-ig" (having the quality of).  Thus, the word's origin reflects its meaning of having the quality of sliding or being prone to slipping.
