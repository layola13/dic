The word "rulle" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* It's a word from a specific dialect or jargon not widely known.
* It's a newly coined word or a proper noun.

Please provide the correct spelling or more context if you'd like me to help you analyze the word.
