词源:  The word "comely" originates from the Old English word "cômelic," which combines "cūm" (meaning "coming," "suitable," or "proper") and the suffix "-lic" (meaning "like" or "resembling").  Therefore, the original meaning hinted at something fitting or appropriate in appearance, evolving into the modern sense of attractive.
