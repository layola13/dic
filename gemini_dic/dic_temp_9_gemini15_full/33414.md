词源:  The word "churchman" is a compound word formed from "church" + "man". "Church" comes from the Old English "cyrice," ultimately derived from the Greek "kyriakon," meaning "Lord's house."  "Man" has its origins in Old English "mann."  Therefore, the word literally means "church man," signifying a man associated with the church.

用法说明:

The noun "churchman" is typically used to refer to a male member of the clergy, although it can also refer to a layperson deeply involved in church affairs.  The term can have both positive and negative connotations, depending on the context.  A positive connotation might emphasize piety and dedication to religious service, while a negative connotation might suggest excessive power or a lack of engagement with secular concerns.
