词源:

The word "propagators" comes from the verb "propagate," which has its roots in the Latin word "propagare," meaning "to layer, to spread, to multiply."  "Propagare" itself is formed from "pro-" (forward) and "pagare" (to fix or fasten).  Thus, the original sense involved extending something outward or increasing its presence.  Over time, the meaning broadened to include the spread of ideas and information, as well as the propagation of plants and animals.
