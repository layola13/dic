词源:
The word "outstanding" originates from the Old English "ūtstandan,"  meaning "to stand out," which is a combination of "ūt" (out) and "standan" (to stand).  Its modern meaning developed through the idea of something literally standing out as exceptional, and later extended to the sense of something remaining unresolved or unpaid.
