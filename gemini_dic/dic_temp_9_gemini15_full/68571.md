The word "{fanguo}" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a romanization of a word from another language, likely Chinese (perhaps 反国, meaning "to betray one's country" or "counter-revolution").  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis in the requested format is impossible without knowing the source language and intended meaning.  To provide a response, I need the correct spelling and context of the word.
