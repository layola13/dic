词源：

The word "induplicative" is a relatively rare word formed from the negative prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "duplicative," which means "tending to repeat or duplicate."  Therefore, "induplicative" literally means "not duplicative."  The root "duplic-" comes from the Latin "duplicare," meaning "to double" or "to fold."


用法说明:

"Induplicative" is primarily used to describe writing, speech, or other forms of communication that are free from unnecessary repetition. It implies clarity and efficiency in conveying information.  Because of its rarity, using synonyms like "concise," "succinct," or "terse" is generally preferred in most writing contexts.
