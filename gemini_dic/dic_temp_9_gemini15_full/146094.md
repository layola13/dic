词源:
The word "overeffusive" is formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") to the adjective "effusive."  "Effusive" comes from the Latin word "effusus," the past participle of "effundere," meaning "to pour out."  Therefore, "overeffusive" literally means "excessively pouring out (of feeling)."
