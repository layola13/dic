praezygapophysis:/ˌpreziɡæˈpɒfɪsɪs/| n. |前突椎体突|This word is a neologism or a very rarely used anatomical term, likely a combination of prefixes and roots related to vertebrate anatomy.  It appears to describe a specific bony process or projection, potentially on a vertebra.  Due to its obscurity, a precise definition and usage examples are difficult to provide without further context from a specialized anatomical source.  There is no established entry in standard dictionaries. |例句: (Unable to provide a real-world example due to the word's rarity.  A hypothetical example follows.)
