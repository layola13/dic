USAGE->
This word is a relatively new and uncommon neologism,  and therefore its usage in various grammatical tenses is not consistently established in standard English dictionaries or corpora.  It would typically be used in declarative sentences, often within the context of scientific or medical writing.  There is no established usage in other tenses like past, future, etc. because it describes a state of being rather than an action.

Example 1: The assessment revealed a complete absence of nonimpairments in the patient's motor skills.  评估显示患者的运动技能完全没有无损害。

Example 2:  The researchers documented several instances of nonimpairments during the clinical trial. 研究人员在临床试验中记录了几次无损害的实例。


PHRASE->
This word is not typically used in phrases in common English. Its usage is highly specialized.
