The word "isagelous" is not a word found in standard English dictionaries or etymology resources.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a detailed analysis with pronunciation, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical examples as requested.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  A typo or misspelling of an existing word.  If you can provide the intended word or more context, a correct analysis can be offered.
* **A neologism:** A newly coined word not yet widely accepted.  If this is the case, further information about its intended meaning and usage would be needed.
* **A word from a specific jargon or fictional language:** It might be a technical term from a specialized field, or a word invented for a specific context (e.g., a book, game, or movie).

Please clarify the word or provide more context.  Only then can a proper analysis be given.
