The word "helara" is not found in standard English dictionaries or etymology resources.  It's likely a proper noun (a name), a neologism (newly coined word), a misspelling, or a word from a very specialized or obscure field.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide an analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (book, website, conversation, etc.)
* **What was the surrounding text or conversation?** This will help determine the intended meaning and usage.

Without this information, any analysis would be pure speculation.
