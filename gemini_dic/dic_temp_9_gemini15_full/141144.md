oocyte:/ˈoʊsaɪt/ | n. | 卵母细胞 | An immature female reproductive cell that develops into an ovum (egg) after meiosis.  It is the largest cell in the human body. | Example: The oocyte is fertilized by a sperm cell to form a zygote. 卵母细胞受精子受精形成受精卵。|近义词：ovum (mature stage) |反义词：spermatocyte


USAGE->

虚拟语气:
If the oocyte were mature, fertilization would be more successful. = 如果卵母细胞成熟，受精会更成功。
I wish the oocyte quality were better. = 我希望卵母细胞质量更好。

被动语态:
