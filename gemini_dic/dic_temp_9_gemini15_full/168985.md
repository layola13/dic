词源:
From Middle French *profligat, from Latin proflīgatum, past participle of proflīgare "to cast down, overthrow, ruin," from pro- "forth" + flāgītāre "to strike, beat down," from flāgium "a whip, scourge."  The sense evolved from "ruined, cast down" to "wasteful, extravagant" and then to "dissolute."
