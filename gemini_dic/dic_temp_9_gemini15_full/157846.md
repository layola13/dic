plagiotremata:/ˌplædʒiəʊˈtriːmətə/| n. |多孔类| A subclass of cyclostome bryozoans characterized by their porous zooecia (individual animal chambers).  These are typically small, encrusting colonies found in marine environments.  The name refers to the oblique or slanted nature of the pores in their walls. | Example: The researcher identified the fossil as belonging to the subclass Plagiotremata due to the distinctive angled pores in its zooecial walls. |近义词: Cyclostomata (broader class)|反义词:  None specifically, but contrasting subclasses within Bryozoa could be considered. |名词
