词源:
Derived from the adjective "gullible," which in turn comes from "gull," meaning "to trick or deceive."  The "-ible" suffix indicates capability or susceptibility.  Therefore, "gullible" means "capable of being tricked."  "Gullibly" is simply the adverbial form, modifying verbs to indicate how an action is performed – in this case, in a gullible manner.
