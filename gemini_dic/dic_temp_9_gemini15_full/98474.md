词源：

The word "instableness" is derived from the adjective "unstable," which itself comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "stable."  "Stable" has roots in the Latin word "stabilis," meaning "firm," "steady," or "strong." Therefore, "instableness" literally means "the state of not being stable."
