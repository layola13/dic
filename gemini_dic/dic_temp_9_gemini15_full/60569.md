elasticity:/ˌiːlæˈstɪsəti/| n. |弹性；弹力；伸缩性 |The ability of a substance or object to spring back into shape after it has been stretched, compressed, bent, or distorted.  This property is determined by the material's internal structure and the forces acting upon it.  Elasticity can be observed in various contexts, from the stretching of a rubber band to the deformation of a metal spring.  |例句：The elasticity of the rubber band allowed it to return to its original shape after being stretched.  橡胶带的弹性使它在拉伸后恢复了原来的形状。

The high elasticity of this material makes it ideal for sportswear.  这种材料的高弹性使其成为运动服的理想选择。


|近义词：flexibility, resilience, springiness |反义词：rigidity, inflexibility


词源:  From Late Latin elasticitas, from elasticus "elastic," from Greek ἐλαστικός (elastikos) "fit for driving, pushing," from ἕλκειν (helkein) "to draw, pull."
