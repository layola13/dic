词源:
The word "overreadiness" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the noun "readiness" (meaning "a state of being prepared").  Therefore, it literally means "too much readiness." The word's development is a straightforward combination of existing English elements and doesn't trace back to a specific historical event or person.
