词源:
The word "inscapes" is a relatively modern coinage,  a parallel formation to "landscapes,"  referring to the internal rather than external world. It's a blend of "in" (meaning inside or within) and "scape" (a suffix meaning a view or scene).  The word gained popularity through its usage by the poet Gerard Manley Hopkins, who is credited with popularizing it in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
