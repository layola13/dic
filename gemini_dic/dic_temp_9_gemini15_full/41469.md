词源:
Corniness's is derived from the adjective "corny," which originated in the early 20th century American slang.  The exact etymology is uncertain, but it's likely related to the idea of something being overly sentimental or cliché, like the kind of humor found in cornfields (a nostalgic, simplistic image).  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the quality or state of being corny.
