词源:
The word "politicised" is derived from the noun "politics" and the suffix "-ised" (or "-ized" in American English).  "Politics" comes from the Greek word "politikos," meaning "of, for, or relating to citizens," ultimately stemming from "polis," meaning "city-state."  The suffix "-ised"/-ized" indicates the process of making something into or having the characteristics of something.  Therefore, "politicised" means "made political" or "influenced by politics."
