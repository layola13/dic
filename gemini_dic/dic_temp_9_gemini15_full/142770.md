The word "ottrelite" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or common usage.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a proper noun (like a brand name), or a word from a specialized field not widely known.

To help, I need more context. Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the source might help determine its meaning and allow for a proper analysis.
