词源：

The word "inexorable" comes from the Old French word "inexorable," which itself derives from the Latin word "inexorabilis."  This Latin word is composed of the prefix "in-" (not), "ex-" (out), and "orare" (to speak, to plead).  Therefore, its literal meaning is "that which cannot be pleaded with" or "that which cannot be persuaded."  This reflects the sense of unyielding determination or inevitability inherent in the word's modern usage.
