词源:

The word "quasi-normal" is a combination of "quasi" and "normal".  "Quasi" is derived from the Latin word "quasi," meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly." "Normal" comes from the Latin word "normalis," meaning "according to the rule" or "perpendicular."  Therefore, "quasi-normal" literally means "almost normal" or "nearly normal."


用法说明:

"Quasi-normal" is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that is very close to being normal, but not quite. It often implies a slight deviation from the norm, or a temporary or partial state of normalcy.  It's frequently used in scientific contexts, particularly in physics and engineering, to describe systems that exhibit behavior similar to normal systems, but with some key differences.  It can also be used in less technical contexts to describe situations or behaviors that are almost, but not entirely, normal.
