词源:
The word "rincon" is borrowed from Spanish, where it means "corner" or "nook."  Its ultimate origin is the Latin word "recinctus," meaning "fenced in" or "surrounded."  The Spanish word then made its way into English, particularly in areas with a strong Spanish influence, like the southwestern United States.
