reenjoyments:/ˌriːɪnˈdʒɔɪmənts/| n.|再次享受；重新享受的乐趣|The word "reenjoyments" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, meaning a newly coined word or expression. It's formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "again") to the noun "enjoyments."  Therefore, it logically implies the act or experience of enjoying something again, or the pleasures derived from doing so.  However, due to its non-standard nature, it lacks common usage and established dictionary definitions.  It would be better to use alternative phrasing, such as "renewed enjoyment," "repeated enjoyment," or "enjoying something again." |例句：After a long break, he experienced the reenjoyments of playing the guitar.  (在长时间休息后，他又开始享受弹吉他的乐趣。)  |近义词：renewed enjoyment, repeated enjoyment,  recreation, rediscovery of pleasure |反义词：disappointment, displeasure
