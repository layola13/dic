词源:

The word "disingenuously" derives from the word "ingenuous," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "ingenuus," meaning "noble, freeborn, frank, candid."  The prefix "dis-" adds the sense of negation or opposition. Therefore, "disingenuous" means "not ingenuous," or lacking frankness and sincerity. The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective "disingenuous" into the adverb "disingenuously".
