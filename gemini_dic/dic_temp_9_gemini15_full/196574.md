The word "sest" is not a standard English word. There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of another word.  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "set," "best," "test," or another word entirely?

2. **A neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, slang, or jargon specific to a certain group or context. If this is the case, please provide more context about where you encountered this word.

3. **A word from another language:** It's possible it's a word borrowed from another language. If so, please specify the language.


Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.
