词源:
The word "fucking" originates from the verb "fuck,"  itself of uncertain origin, possibly from Middle Dutch *fucken.  The suffix "-ing" is a common English suffix forming present participles and gerunds.  Over time, "fucking" evolved from its original sexual connotation to become a versatile intensifier and expletive.
