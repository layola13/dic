词源:
The word "evaluating" comes from the verb "evaluate," which itself originates from the Late Latin word "evaluāre," meaning "to ascertain the value of."  This, in turn, is derived from the Latin prefix "e-" (out, from) and "valēre" (to be strong, be worth).  Therefore, the core meaning is to determine the worth or value of something.
