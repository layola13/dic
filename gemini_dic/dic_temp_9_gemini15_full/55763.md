词源:
diversification comes from the verb "diversify," which itself originates from the Late Middle English word "diversifien," meaning "to make diverse or varied."  The prefix "di-" indicates "two" or "apart," while "versify" is related to the Latin word "vertere," meaning "to turn." Thus, the core meaning points to a turning into multiple directions or forms.
