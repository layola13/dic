myxopod:/ˈmɪksoʊpɑːd/| n. |粘菌虫；变形虫 |A myxopod is a type of amoeba, a single-celled organism that moves and feeds using pseudopods (temporary projections of its cytoplasm).  Myxopods are characterized by their ability to form complex networks of pseudopods, often exhibiting a reticulate (net-like) pattern. They are typically found in aquatic environments. | Example:  The researchers observed the myxopod extending its pseudopods to engulf the algae. 研究人员观察到粘菌虫伸出伪足吞噬藻类。  | 近义词: amoeba, protozoan | 反义词:  (None readily applicable;  the antonym would describe a non-amoeboid organism, which is too broad)
