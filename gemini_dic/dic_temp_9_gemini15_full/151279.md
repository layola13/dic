词源:
The word "parfit" is derived from the Middle English word "parfit," which itself comes from the Old French word "parfait," meaning "perfect."  The Old French word ultimately originates from the Latin word "perfectus," the past participle of "perficere," meaning "to make complete" or "to finish."
