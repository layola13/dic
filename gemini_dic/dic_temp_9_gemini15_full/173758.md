This often involves estimation, modelling, or inference based on incomplete or indirect data.  | The quasi-observed data provided a reasonable approximation of the true values.  准观测数据提供了真实值的合理近似值。|  estimated, inferred, simulated | directly observed, measured |


USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective and doesn't have verb conjugations like "What is your name?".  Its usage focuses on describing the nature of data or results.  Examples illustrating its use in different sentence structures are given below:

The model produced quasi-observed results that closely matched the experimental data. 模型产生的准观测结果与实验数据非常吻合。


Comparative Sentences:
Quasi-observed data, while less precise, are often more readily available than directly observed data. 准观测数据虽然精度较低，但通常比直接观测数据更容易获得。

The accuracy of the quasi-observed values was comparable to that of the directly measured values in this specific case. 在这种特定情况下，准观测值的准确性与直接测量值的准确性相当。


Interrogative Sentences:
Are these quasi-observed values statistically significant? 这些准观测值在统计上是否显著？

Were the quasi-observed trends consistent across different datasets? 不同数据集中的准观测趋势是否一致？


PHRASE->
