词源:  The word "mitochondria" is the plural form of "mitochondrion."  It comes from the Greek words "mitos" (μῖτος), meaning "thread," and "chondrion" (χονδρίον), meaning "granule."  This reflects the appearance of mitochondria under a microscope – small, thread-like or granular structures within cells.


用法说明:

Mitochondria is always used as a plural noun.  The singular form, mitochondrion, is less commonly used in general scientific writing.  It's primarily used in biology and related fields.  The word is typically used in sentences describing cellular processes, energy production, or related biological functions.
