词源:
The word "heartening" comes from the verb "to hearten," meaning to encourage or give strength to.  "Hearten" itself is derived from the Middle English word "herten," ultimately related to the Old English word "heorte," meaning "heart."  The suffix "-ing" forms the present participle, and in this case, functions as an adjective.
