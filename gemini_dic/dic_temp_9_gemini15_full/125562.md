词源:

The word "multitasking" is a combination of "multi-" (meaning "many" or "multiple") and "tasking" (referring to the act of assigning or undertaking tasks).  The term emerged in the context of computer science in the late 20th century, referring to the ability of a computer system to handle multiple processes concurrently. It later transitioned into general usage, describing the human ability (or perceived ability) to handle multiple tasks at once.
