"Non-suggestive" is primarily used to describe something that is neutral, objective, and free from any implication or hint.

The opposite, "suggestive," implies a hint or implication, often of a sexual or inappropriate nature.  However, "suggestive" can also be used in a more neutral sense, such as "suggestive evidence."  The context is key to understanding the intended meaning.
