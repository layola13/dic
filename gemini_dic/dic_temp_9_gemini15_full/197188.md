词源:
The word "shape-shifting" is a compound word.  "Shape" comes from Old English *sċeap, meaning "form, figure, appearance."  "Shifting" comes from the verb "to shift," which has roots in Old English *sciftan, meaning "to exchange, change."  Therefore, "shape-shifting" literally means "changing one's shape or form."
