词源:

The word is a modern coinage, formed by combining:

* **hyper-:**  A prefix meaning "excessive," "over," or "beyond."  Derived from Greek ὑπέρ (hupér), meaning "over," "above," or "beyond."

* **accurate:**  Adjective meaning "free from error; correct."  Derived from Latin *accuratus*, from *ad- + currere* ("to run").  It originally implied "carefully done," later evolving to mean "precise."

* **-ness:** A suffix forming abstract nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.  Derived from Old English *-nes.


The combination creates a noun signifying an extreme or excessive degree of accuracy.
