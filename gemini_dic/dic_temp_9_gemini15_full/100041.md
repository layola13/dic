词源:
The word "interplait" is a combination of the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and the verb "plait" (meaning "to braid" or "to weave").  The word therefore literally means "to weave together" or "to braid together."  The root "plait" has Old French origins, ultimately derived from the Latin "plectere," meaning "to weave" or "to braid."
