/ˈpɑːrkiːst/ | adj. | 最多公园特色的；最像公园的 |  Most resembling a park; having the most park-like qualities.  This word is not a standard English word and lacks established dictionary entries.  It's likely a newly coined or rarely used word formed by adding the superlative suffix "-est" to "parky," which itself is informal and means resembling a park.  Therefore, providing examples of its usage in various tenses is not feasible due to its lack of common usage.
