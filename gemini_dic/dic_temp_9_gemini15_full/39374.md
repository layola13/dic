词源:
The word "conjunction" comes from the late Middle English word "conjunccion,"  derived from the Old French "conjonction" and ultimately from the Latin "conjunctio," a combination of "con-" (together) and "jungere" (to join).  The Latin root reflects the core function of conjunctions: to join elements of a sentence together.
