The word "putam" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps you could provide more context (sentence, situation where you encountered it).

2. **It's a slang term, neologism, or dialect word:**  If so, it would be specific to a certain region, group, or online community and would require further information to define.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name or place name not widely known.


Without further information, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  Please provide more context.
