词源：
The word "leathering" is derived from the verb "to leather," which originally meant to beat or thrash.  This usage likely comes from the act of beating leather to soften and prepare it for use.  The association with beating people is a later, figurative extension of this meaning.  The connection to leatherworking is the older and more literal meaning.
