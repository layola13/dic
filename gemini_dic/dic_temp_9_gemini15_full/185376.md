retrogenerative:/ˌretrəʊdʒɛnəreɪtɪv/| adj.| 反向再生；逆向再生 |  Relating to or characterized by the process of regeneration that occurs in a reverse or backward direction, often involving the restoration of a previous state or condition.  It implies a process that reverses or undoes a previous generative process.  The term is often used in contexts involving technological systems or biological processes. | The retrogenerative system automatically corrected errors by reversing the steps that led to them.  反向再生系统通过反转导致错误的步骤来自动纠正错误。|  regenerative, restorative | degenerative, destructive |  形容词
