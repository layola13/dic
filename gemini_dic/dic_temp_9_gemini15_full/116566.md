The word "matiness's" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a misspelling or a non-standard formation.  There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries.  It might be a typographical error, a neologism (newly coined word) used in a specific context, or a misspelling of a word related to "matiness" (which itself is also not a standard English word, though it resembles "mateyness").

To analyze it, we can break it down:

* **"Matiness"**: This resembles "mateyness," which is not a standard word but could be interpreted as an attempt to create an adjective meaning "like a mate" or "having the qualities of a mate."  A "mate" is a friend or companion.

* **"'s"**: This is the possessive suffix, indicating possession or belonging.

Therefore, "matiness's" would *likely* be intended to mean something like "the quality of being like a mate" belonging to someone or something. However, without context, its meaning is unclear and grammatically incorrect.


To provide a proper analysis following your format, we need a valid English word.  Let's analyze "friendliness" instead, as it is a close semantic relative to the intended meaning of "matiness":
