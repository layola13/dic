The word "nonrecuperatory" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "recuperatory," which itself derives from the verb "recuperatory."

* **non-**: This prefix is of Latin origin and simply means "not."  It negates the meaning of the word it precedes.

* **recuperatory**: This part derives from the Latin verb "recuperare," which means "to recover" or "to regain."  The suffix "-atory" forms an adjective, meaning "relating to" or "characterized by" the action of the verb.  Therefore, "recuperatory" means "relating to the act of recovering" or "having the power to recover."

Therefore, "nonrecuperatory" signifies the opposite of having the ability to recover or be healed.  It describes something that is beyond recovery or repair.
