scaphocerite:/ˌskæfəˈsaɪraɪt/| n. |舟形角质层|A chitinous, boat-shaped structure found in some decapod crustaceans, particularly in the male, that is used in mating. It's part of the reproductive system, specifically involved in transferring sperm.|Example: The male shrimp's scaphocerite was noticeably larger than the female's, indicating its reproductive role.|近义词: (no perfect synonyms, related terms include: petasma, appendix masculina)|反义词: (no antonyms)|名词
