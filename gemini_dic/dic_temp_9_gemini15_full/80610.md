Etymology:  The word "goon" likely originated in the early 20th century American slang. Its precise etymology is uncertain, but several theories exist. One suggests it's derived from "goon" meaning a "fool" or "simpleton," which might connect to its current usage. Another possible connection is to the word "goon" used in the early 20th century to describe an incompetent or clumsy person.  The association with violence and intimidation likely developed later, possibly influenced by depictions of gangsters and thugs in popular culture. The word gained further notoriety through its usage in the Popeye cartoons, where Bluto (often called a "goon") was Popeye's nemesis.
