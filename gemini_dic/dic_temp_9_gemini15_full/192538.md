词源:  The word "scudder" likely derives from the Old English word "scutan," meaning "to shoot" or "to dart."  This suggests a connection to the rapid, darting movement implied by the modern meaning.  The evolution of the word involved a shift in meaning from a more general sense of rapid movement to a more specific focus on a swift, almost frantic, running or scurrying.
