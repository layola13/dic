词源:
The word "shank" comes from Old English *sceanca, meaning "leg."  Its various uses – referring to the leg, the long part of an implement, and even, figuratively, to a long, arduous journey – all derive from this original meaning of a long, slender member. The verb sense of "shank" (to hit forcefully) is a later development, possibly related to the image of a strong leg delivering a powerful blow.
