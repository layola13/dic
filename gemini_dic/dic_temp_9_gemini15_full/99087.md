The word "interbreath" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word), a misspelling, or a word from a very niche context.  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer a more informed interpretation.
