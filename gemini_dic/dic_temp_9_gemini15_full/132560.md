nondialyzable: /ˌnɒnˈdaɪəlaɪzəbəl/ | adj. | 不可透析的 |  Unable to pass through a dialyzing membrane; referring to substances too large or too strongly bound to pass through a semipermeable membrane during dialysis.  This term is commonly used in medicine and biochemistry. | 例句：The nondialyzable fraction of the blood sample contained important proteins.  = 血样中不可透析的部分含有重要的蛋白质。


The nondialyzable components of the solution were analyzed separately. = 溶液中不可透析的成分被单独分析。


近义词：impermeable, nonfilterable | 反义词：dialyzable, permeable


词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), "dialyzable" (meaning "capable of being dialyzed"), which in turn is derived from "dialysis" (a process of separating substances based on their differing rates of diffusion through a semipermeable membrane). "Dialysis" itself comes from the Greek word "dialysis," meaning "separation" or "resolution," from "dia-" (through, across) and "lysis" (loosening, dissolving).


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The solution contains nondialyzable components. = 该溶液含有不可透析的成分。
This substance is nondialyzable. = 此物质是不可透析的。


一般过去时:
The researchers found that the substance was nondialyzable. = 研究人员发现该物质是不可透析的。
The experiment showed the material to be nondialyzable. = 实验表明该材料是不可透析的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several nondialyzable toxins. = 科学家们已经鉴定了几种不可透析的毒素。
We have determined that this protein is nondialyzable. = 我们已经确定这种蛋白质是不可透析的。


过去完成时:
They had already known that the waste product was nondialyzable. = 他们早已知道该废物是不可透析的。
The study had shown the compound to be nondialyzable before the publication. = 在发表之前，该研究已经表明该化合物是不可透析的。


将来时:
Future research will focus on the effects of nondialyzable substances. = 未来的研究将集中在不可透析物质的影响上。
We will analyze the nondialyzable fraction of the sample tomorrow. = 我们明天将分析样品的不可透析部分。


虚拟语气:
If the substance were nondialyzable, the experiment would fail. = 如果该物质是不可透析的，实验就会失败。
It would be helpful if we had a method to separate the nondialyzable components. = 如果我们有一种分离不可透析成分的方法，那就太好了。


被动语态:
The nondialyzable components are analyzed using advanced techniques. = 不可透析的成分是用先进的技术进行分析的。
The presence of nondialyzable substances was confirmed by the test. = 该测试证实了不可透析物质的存在。


疑问句:
Is the protein nondialyzable? = 这种蛋白质是不可透析的吗？
Are there any nondialyzable components in this sample? = 这个样本中是否有任何不可透析的成分？


否定句:
The substance is not nondialyzable; it can be dialyzed. = 该物质不是不可透析的；它可以被透析。
The results did not indicate the presence of nondialyzable compounds. = 结果并未表明存在不可透析的化合物。


PHRASE->
