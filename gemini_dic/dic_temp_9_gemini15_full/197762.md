词源:

The word "shilly-shally" is of uncertain origin, but likely a reduplication of an unknown word, perhaps onomatopoeic,  suggesting the sound of hesitant speech or movement.  It first appeared in the late 16th century. The "-ing" form makes it a present participle, often used as a gerund (a verb functioning as a noun).
