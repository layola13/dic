词源:  The word "realienating" is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") and the verb "alienating," which itself comes from the adjective "alien" (meaning "foreign" or "strange") and the suffix "-ating" (forming a present participle).  Therefore, "realienating" means to make someone feel alienated or estranged *again*.
