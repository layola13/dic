hodograph:/ˈhɒdəɡræf/| n. |速度图，霍多格拉夫|A hodograph is a curve that represents the velocity of a moving object as a function of time.  It's constructed by drawing a vector from a fixed origin to a point representing the object's velocity at a given instant. The locus of these points forms the hodograph.  Hodographs are useful in visualizing and analyzing the motion of objects, particularly in situations involving changing velocity and acceleration.|The hodograph of uniform circular motion is another circle.|近义词：velocity diagram|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The hodograph shows the changing velocity of the projectile. = 速度图显示了弹丸速度的变化。
Scientists use hodographs to analyze complex movements. = 科学家使用速度图来分析复杂的运动。


一般过去时:

We will create a hodograph to visualize the satellite's path. = 我们将创建一个速度图来可视化卫星的路径。
They will use the hodograph to predict the future motion of the particle. = 他们将使用速度图来预测粒子的未来运动。


虚拟语气:
If we had a more detailed hodograph, we could make a more accurate prediction. = 如果我们有一个更详细的速度图，我们可以做出更准确的预测。
I wish I had understood the hodograph better during the lecture. = 我希望我在讲座期间能更好地理解速度图。


被动语态:
The hodograph was carefully constructed by the researchers. = 速度图由研究人员仔细构建。
