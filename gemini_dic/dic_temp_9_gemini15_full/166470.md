/ˌpriːˈraɪtʃəsnɪsɪz/ | n. | 先前的义举；过去的正确行为 |  The word "prerighteousnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, likely formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "prior to") with "righteousnesses" (plural of righteousness, meaning morally right behavior).  Therefore, it would suggest actions or deeds considered righteous that occurred before a specific point in time or a particular event.  There are no established usages, synonyms, or antonyms for this word as it is not found in standard dictionaries.  The meaning and usage would entirely depend on the context in which it is used.  Because it's not a standard word, creating example sentences would require inventing a context where such a word might be used.  For example, one might hypothetically use it in a theological context or in a highly specific fictional setting.
