factorizable: /ˈfæktərəzəbl/ | adj. | 可分解的，可因式分解的 |  Able to be expressed as a product of factors, especially in mathematics.  This refers to the ability of a number or expression to be broken down into simpler components through multiplication. For example, a number is factorizable if it can be written as a product of smaller numbers (its factors), and a polynomial is factorizable if it can be written as a product of simpler polynomials. |
