The word "morcha" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a word borrowed from another language, most probably Hindi or another South Asian language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full etymological analysis in the requested format.  To do so, I would need to know the specific language of origin.

However, if you can provide the language of origin, I can try to provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, part of speech, meaning, usage, synonyms, and antonyms, along with example sentences and phrases, following the requested format.
