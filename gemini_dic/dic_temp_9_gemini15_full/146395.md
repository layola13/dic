词源:

The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or too much) and "fluency" (the quality of being fluent).  "Fluency" itself derives from the Middle French *fluence*, ultimately from the Latin *fluentia*, the gerund of *fluere* ("to flow").


USAGE->  (This word is primarily a noun, so tense conjugation doesn't apply directly.  Instead, we'll show how it's used in different sentence structures.)
