The word "byest" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **It's a dialect word or slang:**  It might be used within a specific region or community, but not widely understood.  If you encountered it in a particular context, providing that context would be helpful.

3. **It's a newly coined word or neologism:**  While unlikely, it's possible the word is very recent and hasn't yet made its way into dictionaries.

4. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or a place name.


Without more information, I cannot provide a detailed analysis as requested in the format.  Please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
