retarders:/rɪˈtɑːrdərz/ | n. |阻滞剂，减速剂，延迟物 |A substance or device that slows down a process or movement.  They are used in various applications to control the speed or rate of a reaction, process, or movement. |例句：The paint manufacturer added retarders to slow down the drying time.  油漆制造商添加了缓干剂以减缓干燥时间。

例句：Construction workers used chemical retarders to control the setting time of concrete. 建筑工人使用化学缓凝剂来控制混凝土的凝固时间。


近义词：inhibitors, decelerators, slowdowns |反义词：accelerators, catalysts


词源:The word "retarders" is derived from the verb "retard," which comes from the Old French word "retarder," meaning "to delay" or "to hinder."  This in turn has roots in the Latin word "retardare,"  a compound of "re-" (back) and " tardare" (to be slow).


用法说明:

一般现在时:
Retarders are used in many industrial processes. = 阻滞剂用于许多工业过程中。
The chemical retarders slow down the reaction. = 化学阻滞剂减缓了反应速度。

一般过去时:
The engineers used retarders to control the flow. = 工程师使用阻滞剂来控制流量。
They added retarders to the mixture yesterday. = 他们昨天在混合物中添加了阻滞剂。

现在完成时:
We have used retarders successfully in this project. = 我们在这个项目中成功地使用了阻滞剂。
The company has developed new types of retarders. = 该公司开发了新型阻滞剂。

过去完成时:
They had already added the retarders before the reaction started. = 反应开始之前，他们就已经添加了阻滞剂。
The technicians had tested the retarders extensively. = 技术人员已经对阻滞剂进行了广泛的测试。

将来时:
We will use retarders in the next experiment. = 我们将在下一次实验中使用阻滞剂。
The factory will install new retarder systems. = 工厂将安装新的阻滞剂系统。

虚拟语气:
If we had used more retarders, the reaction would have been slower. = 如果我们使用更多阻滞剂，反应就会更慢。
I wish we had known about these retarders earlier. = 我希望我们早点知道这些阻滞剂。

被动语态:
Retarders are widely used in various industries. = 阻滞剂广泛应用于各个行业。
The drying process is slowed down by retarders. = 干燥过程被阻滞剂减缓了。

疑问句:
What kind of retarders are you using? = 你在使用哪种阻滞剂？
Are retarders necessary for this process? = 这个过程需要阻滞剂吗？

否定句:
They did not use retarders in that experiment. = 他们在那个实验中没有使用阻滞剂。
This type of paint does not contain retarders. = 这种油漆不含阻滞剂。
