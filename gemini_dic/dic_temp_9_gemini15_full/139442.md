词源:
The word "obsolesce" comes from the Latin word "obsolēscere," meaning "to grow old," "to become obsolete," or "to become antiquated."  The prefix "ob-" means "away," "off," or "against," and the root "solēre" means "to be accustomed to" or "to be used to." Therefore, obsolesce literally means "to grow away from being accustomed to" or "to fall out of use."
