词源:

* **pre-**:  prefix meaning "before" or "in advance"
* **meditate**:  verb meaning "to think deeply or carefully"  (from Latin *meditari*, "to think, consider")
* **-ed**: past participle suffix, indicating a completed action or state.

Therefore, "premeditated" literally means "thought about beforehand."
