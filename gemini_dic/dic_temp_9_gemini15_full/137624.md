The word is formed by adding the negative prefix "non-" to "tumultuousness."

"Tumultuousness" comes from "tumultuous," which originates from the Latin word "tumultuosus," meaning "full of tumult," "noisy," or "riotous."  "Tumult" itself has roots in the Latin "tumultus," referring to an uproar or commotion.  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, indicating a state or quality.
