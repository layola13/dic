canalization:/ˌkænəlaɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 管道化；渠道化；定向发展 | The process by which development is constrained to a limited number of pathways, often resulting in similar outcomes despite different initial conditions.  This concept is prominent in developmental biology and evolutionary biology.  It suggests that certain developmental processes are buffered against environmental influences, leading to predictable outcomes.  | Example:  The canalization of development ensures that most individuals within a species develop similar traits despite genetic and environmental variability. = 发育的定向发展确保大多数物种个体尽管存在遗传和环境差异，但仍会发育出相似的特征。

The canalization of water resources is crucial for irrigation. = 水资源的管道化对于灌溉至关重要。 | channelization, standardization | randomness, unpredictability |  N/A

词源:
The word "canalization" comes from the French word "canaliser," meaning "to canalize" or "to channel," which in turn derives from the word "canal," meaning "a channel or conduit for water."  The suffix "-ization" indicates the process of making something into a canal or channel.
