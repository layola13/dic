callbacks:/ˈkɔːlbæks/ | n. |回调函数，回调 |A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, and is executed after some event or action has occurred.  It's a fundamental concept in asynchronous programming and event-driven architectures.  Callbacks allow a program to respond to events without blocking the main thread. |Example:  The JavaScript `setTimeout` function uses a callback function to execute code after a specified delay.  `setTimeout(function() { alert("Hello!"); }, 1000);` This will display an alert box after 1 second.

The server sent a callback to confirm the data was received.  服务器发送了回调来确认数据已收到。

词源:
The word "callback" is a compound word formed from "call" and "back".  "Call" refers to the invocation of a function, while "back" indicates that the function is called back at a later time or in response to an event.  The term emerged in the context of computer programming, specifically in the development of event-driven and asynchronous systems.
