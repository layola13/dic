dimetric:/daɪˈmɛtrɪk/| adj.|二测的，二分的，双向的|Relating to or characterized by two dimensions or measurements.  Often used in the context of crystallography or projection systems where two axes are of equal length and at right angles to each other.|例句：The dimetric projection of the crystal showed its tetragonal structure.  晶体的二测投影显示其四方结构。 The image was created using a dimetric projection technique.  这幅图像是使用二测投影技术创建的。|近义词：two-dimensional, biaxial|反义词：trimetric, three-dimensional


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The crystal exhibits a dimetric structure. = 晶体呈现二测结构。
This design utilizes dimetric proportions. = 此设计采用二测比例。


一般过去时:
The geologist analyzed the dimetric crystals. = 地质学家分析了二测晶体。
The architect used a dimetric drawing for the blueprint. = 建筑师在蓝图中使用了二测图。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several dimetric minerals. = 科学家们已经鉴定了几种二测矿物。
Researchers have successfully modeled the dimetric system. = 研究人员已成功模拟了二测系统。


过去完成时:
They had already studied the dimetric projection before the presentation. = 他们在演示之前就已经学习了二测投影。
The team had completed the analysis of the dimetric data. = 团队已经完成了对二测数据的分析。


将来时:
We will examine the dimetric properties of the material. = 我们将检查该材料的二测特性。
Engineers will use dimetric modeling for the project. = 工程师们将为此项目使用二测建模。


虚拟语气:
If the projection were truly dimetric, the angles would be 90 degrees. = 如果投影确实是二测的，那么角度将是90度。
I wish I had understood the dimetric system better earlier. = 我希望我早点更好地理解二测系统。


被动语态:
The dimetric image was carefully analyzed. = 二测图像被仔细分析。
The data was interpreted using a dimetric framework. = 数据是使用二测框架解释的。


疑问句:
Is this a dimetric representation? = 这是二测表示吗？
Are the axes of this projection dimetric? = 此投影的轴是二测的吗？


否定句:
The structure is not dimetric; it's trimetric. = 该结构不是二测的；它是三测的。
The drawing does not accurately reflect the dimetric proportions. = 图纸并没有准确地反映二测比例。


PHRASE->
dimetric projection = 二测投影
dimetric drawing = 二测图
dimetric crystal = 二测晶体
dimetric system = 二测系统
dimetric analysis = 二测分析
