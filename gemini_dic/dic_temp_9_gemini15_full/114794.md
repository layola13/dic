词源:
From Old English *malte, from Proto-Germanic *malta-.  Cognates include German Malz and Dutch mout.  The word ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *mel- ("to grind").  While the modern usage often refers to the product of malting barley, the original meaning was more general, referring to the process of preparing grain for brewing or other uses.
