词源:  The word "ranks" originates from the Old French word "ranc," meaning "row," "line," or "rank." This ultimately derives from the Germanic root *hrank- meaning "a row," "a line," or "a series." The modern English meaning of "ranks" expanded to include the concept of hierarchical order and social standing over time.
