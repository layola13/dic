Geometric shapes and patterns are often characterized by straight lines, curves, angles, and points, arranged in a precise and often symmetrical manner. |例句：The design features geometric patterns. 这个设计具有几何图案。

例句：He used geometric principles to solve the problem. 他用几何原理解决了这个问题。


近义词：geometrical | 反义词：amorphous, irregular


词源:From Middle English *geometrik, from Old French geometrique, from Latin geometricus, from Greek γεωμετρικός (geōmetrikós), from γεωμετρία (geōmetría) "geometry".  The Greek word itself is a compound of γῆ (gê) "earth" and μέτρον (métron) "measure".  The original sense referred to land measurement.
