The word "primatals" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized field not widely known.

To help, I need clarification:

1. **Source:** Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the context (book, article, conversation, etc.) will help determine its meaning and potential origin.
2. **Intended meaning:** Do you have a guess about what the word might mean?  This will assist in finding potential corrections or related terms.

Once you provide this information, I can offer a more accurate analysis or suggest alternative words.
