mesoxalate: /ˌmɛzɒkˈsæleɪt/ | n. | 中草酸盐 | Mesoxalate is a salt or ester of mesoxalic acid.  It's a chemical compound derived from mesoxalic acid, characterized by the presence of a central carbon atom doubly bonded to two oxygen atoms (a ketone group) and singly bonded to two carboxyl groups.  Various mesoxalate salts exist depending on the cation involved (e.g., sodium mesoxalate, potassium mesoxalate).  They are often used in chemical synthesis and research. | The researchers used sodium mesoxalate in their experiment to study its catalytic properties.  研究人员在实验中使用草酸钠研究其催化特性。 |  oxalate, glyoxylate |  (no direct antonym) | 名词
