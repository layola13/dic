词源:
The word "presentably" is derived from the word "present," meaning "to show" or "to offer."  The suffix "-able" means "capable of being" or "suitable for." Therefore, "presentably" means "suitable for presentation" or "in a manner suitable for being presented."  This implies a neat, tidy, and appropriate appearance.
