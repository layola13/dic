词源:
The word "coxswain" comes from the Middle English "coxswayn," a combination of "cox" (meaning "cook" or "ship's boy," ultimately from the Old Norse "kokkr") and "swain" (meaning "boy," "servant," or "young man").  Originally, the coxswain was a young man assisting the captain, often responsible for cooking and other menial tasks.  Over time, the role evolved, and the coxswain became primarily responsible for steering the boat.
