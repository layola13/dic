词源:

The word "non-revocation" is a compound word formed from:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not," "opposite of," or "lack of."
* **revocation**:  The act of revoking or canceling something; derived from the verb "revoke," ultimately from Latin *revocare* ("to call back").  *Re-* is a prefix meaning "back" or "again," and *vocare* means "to call."
