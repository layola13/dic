用法说明:

This adjective is primarily used to describe events or processes that are not happening at the same time.  It emphasizes the lack of temporal coincidence.  It's often used in technical contexts, particularly in computer science and engineering, to describe processes that don't happen at once.  However, it's also applicable in more general contexts to describe any events separated in time.
