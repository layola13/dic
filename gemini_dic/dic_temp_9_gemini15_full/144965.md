/ˌoʊvərəˈbjuːsɪvnəsɪz/ | n. |过度滥用；过度使用；虐待行为的复数形式 |The word "overabusivenesses" is not a standard English word. It's formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to "overabusiveness," which itself is a combination of "over," "abuse," and "-ive" plus "-ness."  It attempts to create a plural form of the already somewhat awkward noun "overabusiveness."  The meaning would refer to multiple instances or types of excessive abuse or overuse. However, native speakers would generally avoid using this word and opt for clearer, more concise alternatives. |  The multiple instances of his overabusivenesses towards his employees eventually led to his dismissal. = 他多次对员工过度滥用职权，最终导致他被解雇。  | excesses, abuses, instances of mistreatment | kindness, gentleness, consideration |  n.


USAGE->
This word is not commonly used, so demonstrating its usage across various grammatical tenses would be artificial and unhelpful.  The meaning can be expressed using simpler, more natural vocabulary. For example:

General Usage:  Multiple instances of abuse could be expressed as "multiple abuses," "numerous instances of mistreatment," "repeated acts of aggression," etc.

Example sentences illustrating the concept:

* "His repeated acts of aggression towards his colleagues were unacceptable." = 他一再对同事进行攻击，这是不可接受的。
* "The numerous instances of workplace harassment led to a company-wide investigation." = 众多职场骚扰事件导致了公司范围内的调查。


PHRASE->

* instances of abuse
* patterns of overuse
* excessive use of power
* repeated acts of violence
* forms of mistreatment
