用法说明:

plausiblest is the superlative form of the adjective plausible, meaning it signifies the highest degree of plausibility among a set of options.  It is used to describe something that is more believable or likely than any other alternative.  It's generally used in formal contexts.  Because superlative adjectives are often considered somewhat emphatic, it is less common than using "most plausible" or even "plausible".
