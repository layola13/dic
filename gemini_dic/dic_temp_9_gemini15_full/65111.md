etherification:/ˌiːðərifiˈkeɪʃən/ | n. | 醚化；醚化作用 | The process of producing an ether.  This typically involves the reaction of an alcohol with another alcohol or with an alkyl halide in the presence of an acid catalyst. | Example: The etherification of ethanol with methanol produces methoxyethane (ethyl methyl ether).  乙醇与甲醇的醚化反应生成甲氧基乙烷（甲乙醚）。 |近义词: ether formation | 反义词:  N/A
