词源:  The word "professionalize" is derived from the noun "profession" and the suffix "-ize," which means "to make or become."  "Profession" itself comes from the Middle English word "professioun," ultimately deriving from the Late Latin "professio," meaning "declaration, avowal, profession."  The sense of "occupation requiring specialized knowledge and skills" developed later.
