pharmacography:/ˌfɑːrməˈkɒɡrəfi/| n. |药物志；药物学；药物描述|The description of drugs, including their physical properties, sources, and methods of preparation.  It focuses on the practical aspects of drugs, rather than their chemical or therapeutic properties. Pharmacography often includes information on the history, cultivation, and collection of medicinal plants. |Example:  A detailed pharmacography of the ginseng plant would include its morphology, habitat, harvesting techniques, and traditional uses. =  人参植物的详细药物志将包括其形态、栖息地、收获技术和传统用途。

The pharmacography of this new antibiotic is still under development. =这种新型抗生素的药物志仍在开发中。|近义词：pharmacopoeia (though pharmacopoeia focuses more on standards and official listings), materia medica|反义词：None directly applicable.  The antonym would be a study focusing solely on the chemical or therapeutic aspects, without the descriptive detail of pharmacography.
