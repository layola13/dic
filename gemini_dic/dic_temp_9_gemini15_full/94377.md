词源:

The word "implausibility" is derived from the prefix "im-" (meaning "not"), the adjective "plausible" (meaning "believable" or "likely"), and the suffix "-ity" (forming nouns of quality or state).  Therefore, it literally means "not plausibility" or "the state of not being believable."  The root word "plausible" traces back to the Latin word "plaudere," meaning "to applaud" or "to please," reflecting the idea that something plausible is pleasing or acceptable to believe.
