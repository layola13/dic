ptilopaedes: /ˌtɪloʊˈpiːdiːz/ | n. | 羽毛足类动物 |  A ptilopaedes refers to a group of extinct, feathered dinosaurs characterized by their feathered feet.  The term is largely used within paleontological circles and scientific literature. While not a widely known word outside of specialized fields, it's crucial for understanding certain prehistoric avian lineages.  There is limited information regarding specific species designated as ptilopaedes, as the classification is based on shared characteristics rather than a single taxonomic group.  Further research is needed to clarify the exact species included within this classification. |  例句：The discovery of fossilized ptilopaedes tracks provides further evidence of feathered dinosaurs. = 羽毛足类动物化石足迹的发现为带羽毛的恐龙提供了进一步的证据。

The study of ptilopaedes remains an active area of research in paleontology. = 羽毛足类动物的研究仍然是古生物学的一个活跃研究领域。| 近义词: feathered dinosaur (a broader term)| 反义词: N/A |  名词

词源:  The word "ptilopaedes" is a combination of Greek roots:  "ptilon" (πῖλον), meaning "feather," and "paedes" (παιδές), meaning "child" or "offspring," potentially alluding to the young or small size of some species, or implying a connection to early avian lineages.  The term was likely coined by paleontologists to describe the unique characteristic of feathered feet in certain dinosaurs.
