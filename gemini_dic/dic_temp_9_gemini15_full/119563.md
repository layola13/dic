/ˌmaɪkroʊtæˈsɪmɪtər/ | n. | 微型压力计 | A microtasimeter is a highly sensitive instrument used to measure minute changes in temperature or pressure.  It's particularly useful in situations where extremely small variations need to be detected.  The device's sensitivity allows it to register changes that are imperceptible to other instruments. | The microtasimeter detected a slight pressure change before the earthquake. 微型压力计在地震前探测到轻微的压力变化。 The researchers used a microtasimeter to measure the heat generated by the chemical reaction. 研究人员用微型压力计测量化学反应产生的热量。 |  (暂无常用近义词，取决于具体应用场景，可能包括pressure sensor, thermometer等) | (暂无常用反义词) | 名词

词源:
The word "microtasimeter" is a compound word formed from:

* **micro-**:  A prefix meaning "small," derived from the Greek word "μικρός" (mikrós) meaning "small."
* **tasimeter**: A word referring to an instrument for measuring small changes in temperature or pressure.  While the exact etymology of "tasimeter" is less clear, it’s likely a combination of "taso" (meaning "to measure," related to Greek "τάσσω" (tássō) meaning "to arrange, order" and potentially suggesting the arrangement of measuring components) and "-meter" (a suffix indicating a measuring instrument, from Greek "μέτρον" (métron) meaning "measure").

Therefore, "microtasimeter" literally means "a small instrument for measuring small changes."
