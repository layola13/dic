词源:
The word "satisfying" comes from the verb "satisfy," which originates from the Latin word "satisfacere," composed of "satis" (enough) and "facere" (to make, to do).  Therefore, "satisfacere" literally means "to make enough" or "to suffice."  The suffix "-ing" transforms the verb into a present participle, functioning as an adjective.
