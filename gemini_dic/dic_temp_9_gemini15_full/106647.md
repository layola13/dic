The arrival of the kurofune is a pivotal moment in Japanese history, marking the end of the Sakoku period (national isolation).|例句：The arrival of the kurofune in 1853 forced Japan to end its self-imposed isolation.  黑船于1853年的到来迫使日本结束了自我封闭的政策。


The term "kurofune" is a compound word combining "kuro" (黒), meaning "black," and "fune" (船), meaning "ship."  It's not a word found in English dictionaries as it is a loanword directly from Japanese. The ships were perceived as black because of the color of their hulls, and the term is now strongly associated with the historical event.  There are no direct English synonyms, but one could use phrases like "Perry's Black Ships," "the American fleet of 1853," or "the ships that opened Japan" to convey the meaning.  There are no antonyms.
