词源:
The word "non-partisanship" is a compound word.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," "partisanship" derives from "partisan," which ultimately comes from the French "partisan" (supporter, follower).  Therefore, non-partisanship literally means "not being a supporter of a particular party or cause."
