The word "haruku" is not found in standard English dictionaries or etymology resources.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  It's likely a proper noun (a name), a word from a different language, or a neologism (newly coined word).  To provide an analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (e.g., a book, a conversation, a website)
* **What is the surrounding text or conversation?** This will help determine the word's meaning and usage.
