词源:  The adverb "cumbersomely" is derived from the adjective "cumbersome," which ultimately originates from the Middle English word "cumbrous," meaning "heavy, bulky." This, in turn, is believed to be related to the Old English word "cumber," meaning "to hinder, to obstruct."  The addition of "-some" to "cumber" created the adjective "cumbersome," signifying something that causes hindrance or difficulty. The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, describing the manner in which an action is performed.
