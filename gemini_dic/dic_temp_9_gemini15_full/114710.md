The word "malleal" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it in major resources like Merriam-Webster, Oxford English Dictionary, or Cambridge Dictionary.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling or provide more context where you encountered this word?

2. **It's a neologism or technical term:** It could be a newly coined word, a word specific to a particular field (like medicine or engineering), or a word from a dialect or jargon not widely used.

3. **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a proper noun (a name of a person, place, or thing), in which case a different approach to definition is needed.

Without more information, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible. Please provide additional context or clarify the spelling.
