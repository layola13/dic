sandbagger:/ˈsændˌbæɡər/| n. |沙包装填工；（尤指）故意隐藏实力的人；|A sandbagger is someone who pretends to be less competent or skilled than they actually are, often to gain an advantage in a competition or game.  They deliberately underperform initially to lull their opponents into a false sense of security before unleashing their true abilities.  The term originates from the practice of filling sandbags to make them heavier than they appear, thus deceiving opponents. |例句：He's a real sandbagger; he played terribly in the first round, but then he won the whole tournament. 他真是个隐藏实力的人；他在第一轮表现得很糟糕，但却赢得了整个比赛。


例句：She's a sandbagger at golf; she always pretends to be a weaker player than she actually is. 她在高尔夫球方面是个隐藏实力的人；她总是假装比实际水平弱。


近义词：underachiever, dissembler, deceiver, wolf in sheep's clothing


反义词：show-off, boastful, open, honest


词源：The term's origin lies in the practice of filling sandbags.  Sandbags, appearing deceptively light, can be unexpectedly heavy once filled. This deceptive weight mirrors the sandbagger's hidden abilities.  The metaphorical extension to competitive situations likely arose in the early to mid-20th century.
