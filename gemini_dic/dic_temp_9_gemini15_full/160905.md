post-genitive:/ˌpoʊstˈdʒɛnɪtɪv/| adj.|后置所有格的|A post-genitive is a grammatical construction where a possessive form (typically a genitive case) is followed by another phrase or clause that further modifies or specifies the possessed noun.  It's a type of  double genitive, often appearing complex but serving to clarify possession or attribution.  The added phrase can be a prepositional phrase, a relative clause, or another genitive.  The post-genitive structure is more common in English than many other languages.|例句：That friend of my brother's is a doctor. = 我兄弟的那个朋友是医生。(Here, "of my brother's" is the post-genitive modifying "friend")  The book of the author I mentioned is excellent. = 我提到的那个作者的书很好。(Here, "of the author I mentioned" is the post-genitive modifying "book")|近义词：double genitive|反义词：无
