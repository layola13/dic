overrealisms: /ˌoʊvərˈriːəlɪzəmz/ | n. | 超现实主义作品；过度现实主义 |  Overrealisms refers to artistic styles or movements that go beyond the representation of mere reality, often incorporating elements of fantasy, surrealism, or exaggeration to create a heightened sense of reality or to explore deeper psychological or philosophical themes.  It's not a widely established term with a single, universally accepted definition, but rather a concept used to describe certain artistic tendencies.  The term suggests a departure from simple realism, exceeding or surpassing it in some significant way. | Example:  The painter's works, while rooted in realistic depiction, are considered overrealisms due to their intensely saturated colors and dreamlike atmospheres.  = 画家的作品虽然根植于现实的描绘，但由于其色彩浓烈和梦幻般的氛围，被认为是超现实主义的。 | 近义词: hyperrealism, surrealism, magical realism | 反义词: minimalism, abstraction
