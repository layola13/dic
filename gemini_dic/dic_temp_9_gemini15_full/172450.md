词源:
The word "pyjama" ultimately derives from the Hindi word "payjama," which itself is a compound of Persian words:  "pā," meaning "leg" or "foot," and "jāmā," meaning "garment" or "clothing."  It entered English via Urdu and other South Asian languages during the British colonial period in India.  The plural form "pyjamas" is often treated as singular in modern English usage.
