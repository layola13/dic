/ˌoʊvərˈskɛptɪkəlniːsɪz/ | n. | 过度怀疑；过分怀疑 |  The word "over-skepticalness's" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be an incorrectly formed noun, combining the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively), the adjective "skeptical" (expressing or feeling doubt), and the possessive suffix "'s". The correct form would likely be "over-skepticalness" or even better,  a phrase like "excessive skepticism" or "extreme doubt".  The word attempts to describe a state of being excessively skeptical. | Example: His over-skepticalness's [should be "His over-skepticalness" or "His excessive skepticism"] prevented him from accepting the evidence.  他的过度怀疑使他无法接受证据。 | 近义词: excessive doubt, extreme incredulity, hyper-criticism | 反义词: naivete, gullibility, credulity | 名词
