词源:

* **over-**: Old English *ofer, *of, from Proto-Germanic *ubir (compare Old High German *upar, Old Norse *yfir, Gothic *ufar), of unknown ultimate origin.  Meaning "above," "beyond," "across," etc., it often serves as an intensifying prefix, indicating "too much," "excessively," or "beyond the limit."

* **luxuriant**: From Latin *luxuriāns, present participle of *luxuriāri ("to grow luxuriantly," "to be wanton"), from *luxuria ("abundance," "luxury," "wantonness").  The Latin root ultimately relates to the concept of "growth" and "abundance."
