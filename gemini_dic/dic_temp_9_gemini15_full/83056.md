词源:
The word "gargoyle" comes from the Old French word "gargouille," which referred to a waterspout or a type of mythical creature associated with such spouts.  The ultimate origin likely lies in a combination of the Old French "gargouiller" (to gurgle) and perhaps a reference to the throat of a mythical beast.  Thus, the word's evolution reflects both the functional and the fantastical aspects of these architectural features.
