myosin: /ˈmaɪəsɪn/ | n. | 肌球蛋白 | A fibrous protein that forms (together with actin) the contractile filaments of muscle cells and is also involved in motion in other types of cells.  | 例句：Myosin is a motor protein essential for muscle contraction. 肌球蛋白是肌肉收缩所必需的运动蛋白。| 例句：The interaction between actin and myosin generates the force for muscle movement. 肌动蛋白和肌球蛋白之间的相互作用产生肌肉运动的力。| 近义词：actin (in the context of muscle contraction) | 反义词：无
