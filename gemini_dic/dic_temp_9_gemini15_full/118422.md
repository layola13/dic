词源:
Merry (adj.) + making (n.) + -s (plural suffix)

Merry comes from Old English *mærig, meaning "joyful, pleasant."  Making is the gerund form of "to make," referring to the creation or act of organizing events.  The "-ings" suffix creates a plural noun denoting multiple instances of merrymaking.
