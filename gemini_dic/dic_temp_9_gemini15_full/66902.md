词源:
The word "expedition" comes from the Old French word "expedition," meaning "a sending forth, dispatch," ultimately derived from the Latin word "expeditio," which combines the prefix "ex-" (out) and the verb "pedire" (to set the foot, to go).  This reflects the core meaning of a journey undertaken with a specific purpose.
