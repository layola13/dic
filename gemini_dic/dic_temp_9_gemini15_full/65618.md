词源:  The word derives from "evangelical," which comes from the Greek word "euangelion" (εὐαγγέλιον), meaning "good news."  This refers to the Gospel accounts of Jesus Christ's life, death, and resurrection.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective "evangelical" into an adverb, modifying verbs and describing how an action is performed.
