The word "germest" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it with phonetic transcription, grammatical function, meaning, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or phrases.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a neologism, a word from a specific dialect, or a word from a different language.  To provide the requested analysis, I need a valid English word.
