USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective and doesn't have verb conjugations or tenses like "to be" or "to do".  It describes the state of something (usually a sentence or phrase) being ungrammatical.  Therefore, examples illustrating tenses are not applicable.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "paragrammatical".  The word itself indicates a flaw, so it's not typically used in idiomatic expressions.
