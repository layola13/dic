词源:

The word "endorsingly" is derived from the verb "endorse," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "endoser," meaning "to put one's name on the back of (a document)."  This evolved to mean "to approve or support," a meaning that carries over into the adverbial form "endorsingly."  The "-ingly" suffix transforms the verb into an adverb, indicating the manner in which an action is performed.
