词源:
The word "schizophrenically" is derived from "schizophrenia," which itself originates from the Greek words "schizo" (σχίζω), meaning "to split," and "phren" (φρήν), meaning "mind" or "diaphragm."  The suffix "-ically" indicates "in a manner characteristic of."  Therefore, "schizophrenically" means "in a manner characteristic of schizophrenia."
