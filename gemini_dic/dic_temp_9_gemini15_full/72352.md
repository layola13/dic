词源:
Floweriness is derived from the word "flowery," meaning full of flowers or decorated with flowers.  Figuratively, it came to mean excessively ornate or decorated in language or style. The addition of "-nesses" creates a plural noun form, indicating multiple instances of flowery language or style.  Therefore, "flowerinesses" refers to several instances or examples of excessive ornamentation in writing or speech.
