词源:
The word "reflectent" is derived from the verb "reflect," which comes from the Latin word "reflectere," meaning "to bend back," "to throw back." The suffix "-ent" is an adjective-forming suffix indicating something that does the action of the verb.  Therefore, "reflectent" literally means "something that bends or throws back light, heat, or sound."
