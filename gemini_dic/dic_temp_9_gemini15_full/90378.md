The word "howdahed" is not a recognized word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries or word databases.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specific dialect or jargon not widely known.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  To provide a response like the example, a valid English word is needed.
