The word "counsel" does not exist in the English language.  There is, however, the word "counsel", which I will analyze below.

counsel: /ˈkaʊnsəl/ | n., v. | 劝告；忠告；律师；商议 | Advice, guidance, or consultation; to give advice or guidance. |  近义词：advice, guidance, consultation, recommendation | 反义词：misguidance, disregard


**Noun (n.):**

* **Meaning:**  Advice, guidance, or consultation offered by one person to another.  It can also refer to a lawyer or group of lawyers.

* **Example 1:**  The doctor offered her some *counsel* on managing stress.  医生给她提供了一些关于压力管理的建议。

* **Example 2:**  She sought the *counsel* of her lawyer before making a decision.  在做决定之前，她寻求了她律师的建议。

**Etymology:**

The word "counsel" comes from the Old French word *conseil*, meaning "advice, counsel, plan," which ultimately derives from the Latin word *consilium*, having the same meaning.  The Latin word is built from *con-*, a prefix meaning "together," and *salire*, meaning "to leap, jump, spring." The original sense seems to have implied a coming together of ideas.
