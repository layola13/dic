词源:
The word "fixture" comes from the Old French word "fixture," meaning "a fixing, fastening." This ultimately derives from the Latin verb "figere," meaning "to fix" or "to fasten."  The sense of scheduled events developed later, likely from the idea of fixed or scheduled dates for matches or events.
