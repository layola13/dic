Etymology:

The word "plagiarists" derives from the Latin word "plagiarius," which originally meant "kidnapper" or "abductor."  The semantic shift to "one who steals another's writings or ideas" occurred because the act of stealing someone's intellectual property was seen as a kind of theft, similar to kidnapping a person.  The Latin word itself is likely derived from "plaga," meaning "net" or "snare," suggesting the act of trapping or capturing someone's work.  The suffix "-ist" indicates a person who performs the action.
