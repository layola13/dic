词源:

The word "paneled" derives from the word "panel," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "pannel," meaning "a piece of cloth," or "a square of fabric." This refers to the original use of panels as sections of fabric or other material used to create a larger piece or structure. Over time, the meaning evolved to include the broader sense of any sectioned surface or structure.
