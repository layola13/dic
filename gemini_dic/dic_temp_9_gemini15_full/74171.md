The word "fountful" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical analyses as requested.  The word might be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure lexicon.
