retro-engine:/ˈrɛtroʊˌɛndʒɪn/| n. |逆向引擎；反向引擎|A retro-engine is a type of rocket engine that uses the exhaust gases from a main engine to generate thrust in the opposite direction, typically for attitude control or deceleration.|例句：The spacecraft used its retro-engine to slow down before entering the atmosphere.  宇宙飞船在进入大气层之前使用了逆向引擎减速。  The retro-engine system provided precise control during the landing maneuver. 逆向引擎系统在着陆过程中提供了精确的控制。|近义词：reverse thrust engine, deceleration engine |反义词：main engine, propulsion engine


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The retro-engine system functions flawlessly. = 逆向引擎系统运行完美无缺。
