DBC:/ˈdiːbiːsiː/|abbr.|数据库集群|Database Cluster| A DBC is a group of databases that work together to provide increased performance, availability, and scalability.  It typically involves multiple database servers working in coordination to manage and store data. | Example: The company migrated its data to a DBC to improve performance. 这家公司将其数据迁移到数据库集群以提高性能。 |近义词:database system, distributed database|反义词:single database


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The DBC handles thousands of requests per second. = 数据库集群每秒处理数千个请求。
This DBC is optimized for high-throughput transactions. = 此数据库集群针对高吞吐量事务进行了优化。


一般过去时:
The DBC experienced a brief outage yesterday. = 数据库集群昨天短暂中断。
We upgraded the DBC last week. = 我们上周升级了数据库集群。


现在完成时:
The DBC has improved response times significantly. = 数据库集群已显著提高响应时间。
We have added several new nodes to the DBC. = 我们已向数据库集群添加了几个新节点。


过去完成时:
The system had failed because the DBC had crashed. = 系统由于数据库集群崩溃而失败。
Before the migration, the old system had relied on a single database. = 在迁移之前，旧系统依赖于单个数据库。


将来时:
We will expand the DBC next quarter. = 我们将在下个季度扩展数据库集群。
The DBC will be able to handle even more traffic. = 数据库集群将能够处理更多流量。


虚拟语气:
If we had a larger DBC, we could handle more data. = 如果我们有一个更大的数据库集群，我们可以处理更多数据。
It would be beneficial if the DBC were more fault-tolerant. = 如果数据库集群更容错，将更有益。
