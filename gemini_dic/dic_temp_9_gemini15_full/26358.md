词源:

The phrase "by and large" originates from nautical terminology.  "By" referred to sailing close-hauled (close to the wind), and "large" referred to sailing with the wind.  Thus, the phrase originally described the different ways a ship could sail, encompassing a broad range of conditions. Over time, its meaning evolved to describe a general or overall situation, encompassing various aspects or possibilities.
