The word "latiner" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide a response following the requested format.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific jargon or dialect, or a proper noun.  Please double-check the spelling or provide more context.
