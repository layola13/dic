词源:
The word "convincible" is derived from the verb "convince," which comes from the Old French word "convincre," meaning "to overcome, subdue."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "convincere," composed of "com-" (together, thoroughly) and "vincere" (to conquer, overcome).  Therefore, "convincible" literally means "capable of being thoroughly overcome or persuaded."
