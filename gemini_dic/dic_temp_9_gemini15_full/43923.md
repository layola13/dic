词源:  The word "crewcut" originated in the mid-20th century, likely from the association of this short hairstyle with the clean-cut appearance often expected of members of a ship's crew or military personnel.  The "crew" part suggests a group or team, reinforcing the idea of uniformity and a standardized look.


用法说明:

Crewcut is primarily used as a noun.  It describes a specific type of very short haircut.  It's not typically used as a verb or adjective.  While it can be used descriptively ("He has a crewcut."), it doesn't commonly modify other nouns ("a crewcut style" is possible but less frequent than just "crewcut").
