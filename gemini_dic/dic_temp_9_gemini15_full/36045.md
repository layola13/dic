codons:/ˈkoʊdɑːnz/| n. |密码子|A codon is a sequence of three nucleotides that together form a unit of genetic code in a DNA or RNA molecule.  Each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid or stop signal during protein synthesis.|例句：The genetic code consists of 64 codons, each specifying a particular amino acid or a termination signal.|近义词：triplet (in this context)|反义词:None


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the context of molecular biology and genetics; therefore, grammatical tense usage examples are not directly applicable in the same way as with common verbs or nouns.  Instead, here are examples of how "codon" is used in sentences demonstrating different scientific contexts:


Present Tense:
This codon specifies the amino acid glycine. = 这个密码子指定甘氨酸氨基酸。
The researchers are analyzing the codons in the viral genome. = 研究人员正在分析病毒基因组中的密码子。


Past Tense:
Scientists identified a new codon in the bacterial strain. = 科学家在一个细菌菌株中鉴定了一个新的密码子。
The experiment showed that the mutated codon resulted in a non-functional protein. = 实验表明，突变的密码子导致了非功能性蛋白质。


Future Tense:
Future studies will investigate the role of this codon in gene regulation. = 未来的研究将调查这个密码子在基因调控中的作用。
We will sequence the DNA to determine the codons present. = 我们将对DNA进行测序以确定存在的密码子。


Passive Voice:
The codon was found to be highly conserved across species. = 发现该密码子在不同物种中高度保守。
The amino acid sequence is determined by the codons in the mRNA. = 氨基酸序列由mRNA中的密码子决定。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "codon." The term is used within specialized scientific terminology.  However, we can illustrate its use in phrases describing biological processes:


"start codon":  起始密码子
"stop codon":  终止密码子
"codon usage bias": 密码子使用偏倚
"rare codon": 稀有密码子
"synonymous codon": 同义密码子
