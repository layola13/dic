photopolarimetric: /ˌfoʊtoʊˌpoʊlərɪˈmɛtrɪk/ | adj. | 光偏振测量的；光偏振计的 | Relating to or using photopolarimetry, the measurement of the polarization of light.  This technique combines photometry (the measurement of light intensity) with polarimetry (the measurement of polarization).  It's used in various fields to analyze the properties of materials and light sources. |  Example:  The photopolarimetric data revealed the presence of crystalline structures in the sample. 光偏振测量数据揭示了样品中存在晶体结构。


The photopolarimetric analysis provided valuable insights into the surface composition of the planet. 光偏振分析为了解行星的表面成分提供了宝贵的见解。


近义词: polarimetric (偏振的), optical (光学的)


反义词:  None directly applicable;  antonyms would relate to the opposite of the measured properties (e.g., unpolarized if referring to light polarization).
