/ˈnɒnˌsteɪnərz/ | n. | 非染色菌 | Nonstainers are bacteria that do not retain the primary dye in Gram staining, typically appearing colorless or clear under a microscope after the staining process.  They are often further classified based on other staining techniques. | Example:  Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a well-known example of a nonstainer, requiring specialized acid-fast staining to be visualized.  = 结核分枝杆菌就是一个众所周知的非染色菌的例子，需要特殊的抗酸染色才能观察到。|近义词：Gram-negative bacteria (in some contexts) |反义词：stainers, Gram-positive bacteria (in some contexts)

USAGE->

一般现在时:
Nonstainers are difficult to identify using standard Gram staining. = 使用标准革兰氏染色法很难鉴定非染色菌。
These bacteria are nonstainers, requiring special staining techniques. = 这些细菌是非染色菌，需要特殊的染色技术。


一般过去时:
The lab technician identified the bacteria as nonstainers. = 实验室技术人员将细菌鉴定为非染色菌。
Researchers found that the unknown bacteria were nonstainers. = 研究人员发现未知细菌是非染色菌。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered several new species of nonstainers. = 科学家们已经发现了几个新的非染色菌物种。
We have confirmed that the sample contains nonstainers. = 我们已经确认样本中含有非染色菌。


过去完成时:
Before the specialized staining, the bacteria had appeared as nonstainers. = 在特殊染色之前，细菌看起来像是非染色菌。
They had assumed the bacteria were nonstainers until further testing. = 在进一步检测之前，他们曾认为细菌是非染色菌。


将来时:
We will use acid-fast staining to identify the suspected nonstainers. = 我们将使用抗酸染色来鉴定可疑的非染色菌。
Researchers will further study the properties of these nonstainers. = 研究人员将进一步研究这些非染色菌的特性。


虚拟语气:
If these were nonstainers, we would need a different staining method. = 如果这些是非染色菌，我们就需要一种不同的染色方法。
I wish we had known they were nonstainers earlier. = 我希望我们早点知道它们是非染色菌。


被动语态:
The bacteria were identified as nonstainers under the microscope. = 在显微镜下，细菌被鉴定为非染色菌。
Special staining techniques are required for nonstainers to be visualized. = 为了观察非染色菌，需要特殊的染色技术。


疑问句:
Are these bacteria nonstainers? = 这些细菌是非染色菌吗？
Could the colorless bacteria be nonstainers? = 无色的细菌可能是非染色菌吗？


否定句:
These bacteria are not nonstainers; they are Gram-positive. = 这些细菌不是非染色菌；它们是革兰氏阳性菌。
The results showed that the sample did not contain nonstainers. = 结果表明样本不包含非染色菌。
