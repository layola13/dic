词源:

The word "deactivator" is formed from the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove or reverse the action of"), the verb "activate" (meaning "to make active or effective"), and the suffix "-or" (meaning "one that performs an action").  Therefore, a deactivator is something that removes or reverses the activation of something else.
