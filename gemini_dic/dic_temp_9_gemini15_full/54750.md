词源：

The word "dispassion" comes from the prefix "dis-" meaning "without" or "lacking," and the noun "passion."  "Passion" itself originates from the Latin word "pati," meaning "to suffer" or "to feel." Thus, "dispassion" literally means "without suffering" or "without strong feeling."  The evolution reflects a shift in meaning of "passion" from simply feeling to strong, often overwhelming emotion.
