The word "hypernymy" is a modern linguistic term. It's constructed from the Greek roots:

* "hyper-" (ὑπέρ-): meaning "over," "above," or "beyond"
* "nym" (ὄνομα): meaning "name"  (related to "onym" which indicates a word or name)

Therefore, "hypernymy" literally means "above-name" or "higher-level name," reflecting its meaning as a relationship between a more general word and its more specific instances.
