词源:
The word "serviceably" derives from the adjective "serviceable," which itself comes from the verb "to serve."  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or suitability.  Therefore, "serviceable" originally meant "capable of being served" or "fit for service." Over time, its meaning evolved to describe something that is practically useful and functions adequately.
