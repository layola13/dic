paragoge:/ˈpærəɡoʊdʒi/| n.|附加音节|The addition of a sound or syllable to the end of a word, typically a vowel.  This is a process in linguistics, often seen in language evolution where a word gains an extra syllable over time.  It's the opposite of apocope. |Example: The addition of '-e' to the Old English word "name" to form "name-e" (which later simplified to "name").  This isn't a common modern English word-formation process, but it has been observed historically.  |近义词：epenthesis (more general term for insertion of sounds)|反义词：apocope (removal of a sound from the end)|名词
