This request is impossible to fulfill completely as the word "matsu" is not an English word.  It's likely of Japanese origin. To provide a response, I need to make assumptions about its intended meaning and context.  If you can provide more information (such as the context where you encountered this word), I can offer a more accurate and helpful analysis.

However, I can show you how to fulfill the request *if* "matsu" were an English word (which it isn't).  I'll create a hypothetical example:

Let's imagine "matsu" is a newly coined verb meaning "to patiently wait for something".


matsu: /ˈmɑːtsuː/ | v. |耐心地等待 | To patiently await something; to persevere in expectation. | Example:  "I matsu the arrival of my package." 我耐心地等待我的包裹到来。 | 近义词: await, expect, anticipate | 反义词: rush, hurry


USAGE->
一般现在时:
I matsu the bus. = 我在等公共汽车。
He matsus his results. = 他在等待他的结果。

一般过去时:
She matsued the news for hours. = 她等了好几个小时的消息。
They matsued the train's departure. = 他们等待火车出发。

现在完成时:

过去完成时:

将来时:

虚拟语气:
If I knew when it would arrive, I wouldn't matsu so long. = 如果我知道它什么时候会到，我就不会等那么久了。
I wish I didn't have to matsu so long. = 我希望我不必等那么久。

被动语态:  (This is less natural with this verb)
The results were matsued for. = 结果被等待着。  (awkward)
The decision was being matsued for impatiently. = 焦急地等待着决定。（勉强可以）

疑问句:
How long will you matsu? = 你要等多久？
What are you matsuing for? = 你在等什么？

否定句:
I won't matsu any longer. = 我不会再等了。
