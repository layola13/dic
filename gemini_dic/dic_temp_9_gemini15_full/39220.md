词源:
The word "conglomeration" comes from the Latin word "conglomerare," meaning "to roll or wind together."  The prefix "con-" means "together," and "glomerare" is related to "glomus," meaning "ball" or "cluster."  Therefore, the word literally means "to roll or gather together into a ball or mass."
