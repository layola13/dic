The word "melodiousnesses" is derived from the adjective "melodious," which itself comes from the French word "melodieux," ultimately from the Greek "melos" (song, tune) and the suffix "-ious" (full of).  The suffix "-ness" is added to "melodious" to create the noun form "melodiousness," and then "-es" is added to form the plural "melodiousnesses".
