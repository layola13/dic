词源:
The origin of "dibs" is uncertain, but it's likely a shortening or alteration of the earlier word "dibbs,"  possibly related to the Old English word "dyppe," meaning "to dip." The connection is tenuous, but the suggestion is that it might refer to the act of symbolically "dipping" one's claim on something.  The modern usage is primarily informal and playful.
