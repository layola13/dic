英文解析： Communicableness refers to the ability of a disease or condition to be transmitted from one person or organism to another.  It emphasizes the ease and potential for spread.  The plural form, "communicablenesses," is less common and typically used when comparing the transmission rates of multiple diseases or conditions.

例句：

The study compared the communicablenesses of various influenza strains. 这项研究比较了各种流感病毒株的传染性。


The high communicablenesses of measles necessitates widespread vaccination. 麻疹的高度传染性需要大规模接种疫苗。


词源：

* **Communicable:**  Derived from the Latin word "communicare," meaning "to share," "to impart," or "to make common."  This root implies the act of sharing or passing something on.

* **-ness:** This suffix is added to adjectives to form nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.  In this case, it transforms "communicable" (adjective) into "communicableness" (noun).

* **-es:** This is the plural suffix, indicating more than one instance of communicableness.  However, using the plural is unusual in most contexts.
