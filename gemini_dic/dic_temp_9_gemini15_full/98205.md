The word "insection" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word not yet widely adopted.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following your requested format.  To help, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered this term.
