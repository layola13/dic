词源:
The word is a compound of "flame" (meaning a bright, glowing body of burning gas) and "retardant" (meaning something that slows or hinders).  The "retard" part comes from the Old French *retarder*, ultimately from Latin *retardare* ("to delay").  Therefore, "flame-retardant" literally means "something that slows or hinders the progress of flames".
