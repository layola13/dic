nonfricative: /ˌnɒnˈfrɪkətɪv/ | adj. | 非摩擦音的 | An adjective describing sounds in phonetics that are not produced by forcing air through a narrow channel in the vocal tract, resulting in a relatively smooth airflow.  This contrasts with fricatives, which create audible friction.  Nonfricatives include plosives, nasals, and approximants. | Example:  The sounds /p/, /b/, /m/, and /n/ are nonfricative consonants.  非摩擦音辅音包括/p/、/b/、/m/和/n/。 | 近义词: non-fricative, plosive (if referring to a specific type of nonfricative) | 反义词: fricative |


词源:  The word is a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "fricative" (referring to a type of consonant sound made with friction).  "Fricative" itself has roots in the Latin word "fricare," meaning "to rub."
