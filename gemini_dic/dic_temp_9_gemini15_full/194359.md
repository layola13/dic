词源:

The word "self-praising" is a compound word formed from "self-" (meaning oneself) and "praising" (the present participle of the verb "to praise").  The "self-" prefix indicates that the action of praising is directed towards oneself.  Therefore, the meaning is straightforwardly derived from the combination of these two elements.
