词源:
The adverb "patchingly" derives from the adjective "patchy," meaning uneven or irregular.  "Patchy" itself comes from "patch," referring to a piece of material used to repair a hole or cover a damaged area. The "-ingly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner in which something is done.
