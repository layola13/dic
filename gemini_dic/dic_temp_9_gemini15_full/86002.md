词源:
The word "headteacher" is a compound word. "Head" means chief or principal, and "teacher" refers to an educator.  Therefore, "headteacher" literally means the chief teacher or the teacher in charge.  Its usage evolved as a more gender-neutral alternative to "headmaster" (for male principals) and "headmistress" (for female principals).
