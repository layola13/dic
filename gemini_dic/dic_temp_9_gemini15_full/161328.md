postpositioning: /ˌpoʊstˈpɒzɪʃənɪŋ/ | n. | 后置，后置法 | The placement of a word or phrase after the word it modifies or governs.  It contrasts with pre-positioning.  Postpositioning is a common feature in many languages, particularly in cases involving relative clauses or adverbial phrases.  The choice between pre- and post-positioning can sometimes affect the meaning or emphasis of a sentence. | Example:  "The house on the hill" (prepositioning) vs. "The hill the house is on" (postpositioning).  The latter example uses postpositioning to place the prepositional phrase "on the hill" after the noun it modifies, creating a slightly different emphasis. | 近义词：rear positioning,  after-positioning | 反义词：prepositioning | 名词
