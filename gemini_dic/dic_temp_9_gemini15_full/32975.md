词源:
The word "chore" ultimately derives from the Old French word "corvée," meaning "forced labor" or "a compulsory service."  This French word has roots in the Latin word "corrogare," which meant "to summon." The sense of compulsory work evolved into the more general sense of routine tasks, especially around the house.
