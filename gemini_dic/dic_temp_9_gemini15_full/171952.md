词源:
The word "puppy" comes from the Middle English word "puppe," which in turn likely originates from a diminutive form of a word related to "dog."  The exact etymological pathway is debated, but the connection to the Old English word "hūppa" (a kind of dog) or similar Germanic roots is highly probable.  The addition of the "-y" suffix indicates a small or young version of the base word.
