词源:
Luckily is derived from the adjective "lucky,"  which comes from the Middle English word "luky," meaning "fortunate" or "having good fortune."  This, in turn, has roots in the Old English word "lūc," meaning "chance," "fortune," or "lot." The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating manner or circumstance.
