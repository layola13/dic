词源:
The word "machineability" is derived from the noun "machine" and the suffix "-ability," which indicates capacity or potential.  "Machine" ultimately comes from the Old French word "machine," itself stemming from the Late Latin "machina," meaning "engine, device, contrivance." The suffix "-ability" is a common English suffix derived from the Latin suffix "-abilitas."
