词源:  The word "hulk" ultimately derives from the Old Norse word "holkr," meaning "ship," particularly a large, merchant ship. Over time, the meaning shifted to encompass the idea of a large, unwieldy object, and then specifically to a derelict vessel.  The sense of a large, strong, and potentially unpleasant person is a later development, based on the visual and metaphorical association with a large, imposing object.
