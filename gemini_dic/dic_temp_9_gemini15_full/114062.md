magnetization:/ˌmæɡnɪtaɪˈzeɪʃən/| n. |磁化；磁性；磁化强度|The process of making a material magnetic, or the degree to which a material is magnetic.  It refers to the alignment of magnetic moments within a material, resulting in a net magnetic field.  The magnetization of a material can be induced by an external magnetic field, or it can be inherent to the material's structure.|例句：The magnetization of the iron core increased significantly when the current was applied.  电流施加后，铁芯的磁化强度显著增加。

The high magnetization of the neodymium magnet makes it very strong.  钕磁铁的高磁化强度使其非常强大。


近义词：magnetic induction, magnetic polarization|反义词：demagnetization

词源:
The word "magnetization" is derived from the word "magnet," which originates from Magnesia, a region in ancient Greece where naturally occurring magnetic stones (lodestones) were found.  The suffix "-ization" indicates the process of making something into a magnet or the state of being magnetic.
