equisonance: /ˈɛkwɪˌsɒnəns/ | n. | 等音，同音异义 | The repetition of similar-sounding words or phrases, often with different meanings, to create a sense of rhythm or musicality in writing or speech.  Equisonance is a rhetorical device that can enhance the aesthetic appeal and memorability of a text.  It is similar to assonance but emphasizes the similarity of the whole word's sound rather than just the vowel sounds. | Example:  "The silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain" (from Edgar Allan Poe).  Here, the repeated "s" sounds and similar rhythms create equisonance.  | 近义词: assonance, consonance, alliteration | 反义词: dissonance |  词性: noun
