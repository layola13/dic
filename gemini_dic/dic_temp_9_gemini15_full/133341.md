This word is extremely rare and not found in standard dictionaries.  It's a complex, artificial-sounding noun formed from the negative prefix "non-", the verb "extend" (meaning to make longer or larger),  the suffix "-ible" (making it an adjective meaning "capable of being extended"), and the further suffix "-ness" (turning the adjective into a noun meaning "the state or quality of being").  Finally, the addition of "-es" pluralizes the word.


Therefore, "nonextendiblenesses" refers to the multiple instances or aspects of something that cannot be extended or expanded.  It highlights the limitations preventing growth, modification, or enlargement.


Because of its rarity and artificial construction, providing examples of its use in different grammatical tenses or in phrases is impractical. The word itself is more likely to be encountered in highly technical writing, possibly related to computer science or engineering, where it describes multiple limitations on expansion or scalability.  The context would be crucial in understanding its precise meaning.
