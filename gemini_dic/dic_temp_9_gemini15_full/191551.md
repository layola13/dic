"Scholarly" originates from "scholar," ultimately tracing back to Old French "escoler" and Latin "scholaris," meaning "of a school" or "belonging to a school." The suffix "-ness" adds the quality or state of being.  Therefore, "scholarlinesses" denotes multiple instances of the qualities associated with a scholar.
