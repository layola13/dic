retrovirus:/ˌrɛtroʊˈvaɪrəs/| n. |逆转录病毒|A retrovirus is a type of RNA virus that inserts a DNA copy of its genome into the host cell's DNA.  This process, called reverse transcription, is carried out by an enzyme called reverse transcriptase, which is unique to retroviruses.  Once integrated, the viral DNA can remain latent or actively produce more viruses.|Example: HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is a well-known retrovirus that causes AIDS.|近义词:RNA virus|反义词:DNA virus


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Retroviruses infect cells by reverse transcription. = 逆转录病毒通过逆转录感染细胞。
The virus replicates its RNA genome. = 病毒复制其RNA基因组。


一般过去时:
Scientists discovered the first retrovirus in the 19th century. = 科学家在19世纪发现了第一种逆转录病毒。
The study analyzed the genetic makeup of a retrovirus. = 这项研究分析了一种逆转录病毒的基因构成。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified many different types of retroviruses. = 研究人员已经鉴定出许多不同类型的逆转录病毒。
Scientists have developed treatments to combat some retroviruses. = 科学家已经开发出治疗某些逆转录病毒的方法。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery of reverse transcriptase, the mechanism of retroviral infection was unknown. = 在发现逆转录酶之前，逆转录病毒感染的机制是未知的。
They had already studied the effects of the retrovirus on the immune system before the experiment began. = 在实验开始之前，他们已经研究了逆转录病毒对免疫系统的影响。


将来时:
Scientists will continue to research new treatments for retroviral infections. = 科学家将继续研究治疗逆转录病毒感染的新疗法。
We will likely discover more retroviruses in the future. = 我们将来可能会发现更多逆转录病毒。


虚拟语气:
If the retrovirus had not been integrated into the host's genome, the cell would not be infected. = 如果逆转录病毒没有整合到宿主的基因组中，细胞就不会被感染。
I wish we had a cure for all retroviral infections. = 我希望我们有治愈所有逆转录病毒感染的方法。


被动语态:
The retrovirus was identified through electron microscopy. = 逆转录病毒是通过电子显微镜鉴定的。
New treatments are being developed to target retroviruses. = 正在开发针对逆转录病毒的新疗法。


疑问句:
What are the characteristics of a retrovirus? = 逆转录病毒的特征是什么？
How do retroviruses replicate their genetic material? = 逆转录病毒如何复制它们的遗传物质？


否定句:
This virus is not a retrovirus; it's a different type of RNA virus. = 这种病毒不是逆转录病毒；它是一种不同类型的RNA病毒。
The study did not find any evidence of retroviral infection. = 这项研究没有发现任何逆转录病毒感染的证据。


PHRASE->
retroviral infection: 逆转录病毒感染
reverse transcription: 逆转录
retroviral therapy: 逆转录病毒疗法
retroviral vector: 逆转录病毒载体
