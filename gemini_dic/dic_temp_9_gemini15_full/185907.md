词源:
The word "revolutionized" comes from the noun "revolution" + the suffix "-ized."  "Revolution" itself originates from the Late Middle English word "revolucioun," derived from Old French "revolucioun," ultimately from Latin "revolutionem" (nominative "revolutio"), meaning "a turning around, a turning back."  The "-ized" suffix indicates that something is made to be or become something else.  Thus, "revolutionized" literally means "made to undergo a revolution."
