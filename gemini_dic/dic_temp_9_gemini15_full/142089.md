orientable:/ˌɔːriˈɛntəbl/ | adj. | 可定向的，可定向化的 |  Able to be oriented; having a consistent orientation.  A surface is orientable if it's possible to define a consistent "normal vector" at each point, such that the vector field is continuous.  In simpler terms, it means you can consistently choose a "side" (like the inside or outside of a surface) without encountering any inconsistencies. For example, a sphere is orientable, but a Möbius strip is not. | The sphere is orientable. 球面是可定向的。|  non-orientable | non-orientable |


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The map is orientable. = 这张地图是可定向的。
This surface is orientable. = 这个表面是可定向的。


一般过去时:
The mathematician proved the surface was orientable. = 数学家证明了该表面是可定向的。
The model was orientable, allowing for consistent analysis. = 该模型是可定向的，允许进行一致的分析。


现在完成时:
Scientists have determined that the object is orientable. = 科学家们已经确定该物体是可定向的。
We have found that the new design is orientable. = 我们发现新的设计是可定向的。


过去完成时:
They had already established that the manifold was orientable. = 他们已经确定该流形是可定向的。
Researchers had shown the structure to be orientable before the experiment. = 研究人员在实验前已经证明该结构是可定向的。


将来时:
The team will confirm whether the space is orientable. = 该团队将确认该空间是否可定向。
This new software will help us determine if the model is orientable. = 这款新软件将帮助我们确定模型是否可定向。


虚拟语气:
If the surface were orientable, the calculations would be simpler. = 如果该表面是可定向的，计算将更简单。
I wish the manifold were orientable, it would make the analysis much easier. = 我希望该流形是可定向的，这将使分析容易得多。


被动语态:
The orientability of the surface was confirmed. = 表面的可定向性得到了证实。
The problem was solved because the object was found to be orientable. = 因为发现该物体是可定向的，所以解决了这个问题。


疑问句:
Is the surface orientable? = 该表面是可定向的吗？
Is this manifold orientable in this context? = 在这种情况下，该流形是可定向的吗？


否定句:
The Klein bottle is not orientable. = 克莱因瓶不可定向。
The Möbius strip is not an orientable surface. = 莫比乌斯带不是可定向曲面。


PHRASE->

orientable surface = 可定向曲面
