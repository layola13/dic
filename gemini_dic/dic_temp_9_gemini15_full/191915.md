词源:
The word "sconce" ultimately derives from the Old French word "esconce," meaning "a shelter" or "a hiding place."  This evolved through Middle English, where it referred to a defensive fortification or a place of refuge.  The meaning shifted to a wall bracket, likely because such brackets offered a protected position for a light source.  The connection to light came later, as candles and later electric lights were placed on these brackets.
