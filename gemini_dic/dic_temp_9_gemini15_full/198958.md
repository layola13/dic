词源:

The word "sight-line" is a compound word formed from "sight" (meaning vision or view) and "line" (meaning a straight, continuous extent).  Its origins trace back to the individual words' Old English roots. "Sight" comes from Old English *siht, and "line" from Old English līne. The combination creates a term specifically referring to a direct line of vision.
