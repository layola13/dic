词源:  Comes from the verb "conspire," which is from the Late Latin word "conspirare," meaning "to breathe together," "to agree," or "to plot together."  The prefix "con-" means "together," and "spirare" means "to breathe." The original meaning implied a secret agreement, often whispered together.  The noun form "conspirant" developed later to denote a participant in such an agreement.
