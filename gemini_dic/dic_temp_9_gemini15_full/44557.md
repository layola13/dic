词源:  Derived from "crotchet," meaning a peculiar or whimsical notion, or a hook or loop.  The "-ily" suffix indicates an adverbial form, but it is used adjectivally to describe a person's behavior. The original sense of "crotchet" is related to the musical note, suggesting something quirky or unconventional.  The pejorative sense of "crochety" developed over time, associating the quirky nature with irritability and bad temper.
