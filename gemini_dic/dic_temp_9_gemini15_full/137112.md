词源:

The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "submissible," which is derived from the verb "submit."  "Submit" comes from the Old French "soumettre," ultimately from the Latin "submittere," meaning "to let down, to put under, to submit."  Therefore, "nonsubmissible" literally means "not able to be submitted."
