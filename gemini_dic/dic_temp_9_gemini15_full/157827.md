词源:
The word "plagiarist" comes from the Latin word "plagiarius," which meant "kidnapper" or "abductor."  The original meaning referred to the abduction of slaves or persons.  The semantic shift to intellectual theft occurred because the act of stealing someone's ideas and presenting them as one's own was seen as a kind of intellectual kidnapping.  The word entered English in the 16th century.
