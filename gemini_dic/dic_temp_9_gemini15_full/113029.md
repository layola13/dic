luminances:/ˈluːmɪnənsɪz/| n. |亮度，光亮度|The measure of the luminous intensity per unit area of a light source or a reflecting surface. It is a photometric measure of the intensity of light emitted from a surface, and is weighted to reflect the sensitivity of the human eye to different wavelengths of light.  |Example: The luminances of the two displays were compared to assess their relative brightness.  两个显示器的亮度进行了比较，以评估它们的相对亮度。|近义词：brightness, radiance, brilliance, intensity|反义词：darkness, dimness|名词
