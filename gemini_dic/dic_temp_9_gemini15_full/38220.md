The word "computat" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It is likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  If you intended a different word, please provide the correct spelling.  For example, did you mean "computation," "compute," or a similar word?  I can then provide the requested analysis.
