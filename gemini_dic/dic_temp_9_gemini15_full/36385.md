coinsurance:/ˌkoʊɪnˈʃʊərəns/ | n. |共同保险；分摊保险；补充保险 |Coinsurance is an agreement between an insurance company and a policyholder where both share the costs of covered losses.  The policyholder pays a percentage of the costs, and the insurance company pays the remaining amount.  It's a way to manage risk and keep premiums lower. |Example:  With 80/20 coinsurance, the insurance company pays 80% of the covered medical expenses, and the policyholder pays the remaining 20%.  The policyholder is responsible for paying the deductible first.

The patient had 80/20 coinsurance, so after meeting his deductible, he paid 20% of his hospital bill. = 病人享有80/20共同保险，因此在支付自付额后，他支付了医院账单的20%。
