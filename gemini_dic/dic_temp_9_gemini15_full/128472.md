词源：
The word "newsletter" is a compound word formed from "news" and "letter."  "News" comes from the Middle English *newes*, plural of *newe* ("new"), ultimately of Germanic origin. "Letter" comes from Old English *lǣter*, from Proto-Germanic *laþōz*, and is related to words implying "carrying" or "bringing".  Therefore, a newsletter is literally a "letter" containing "news".
