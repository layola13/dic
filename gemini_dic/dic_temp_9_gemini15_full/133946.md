The word "nonheathen" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word.  Therefore, a detailed analysis following the requested format is impossible.  To provide a response, we need to analyze its potential meaning based on its constituent parts.

It's likely formed from "non-" (meaning "not") and "heathen."  Let's analyze "heathen" first:

**heathen:** /ˈhiːðən/ | adj., n. | 异教徒；未开化的人；粗鲁的人 | A person who does not belong to one of the main world religions.  The term is often used with negative connotations, implying a lack of civilization or morality.  Historically, it referred specifically to pagans, but now it's often used more broadly and pejoratively.

| Example:  The missionaries sought to convert the heathens.  传教士试图使异教徒皈依。

| Near synonyms: pagan, infidel, barbarian (in its negative sense)

| Antonyms: believer, saint (in a religious context)


Given this, "nonheathen" would hypothetically mean "not a heathen,"  or someone who is *not* a pagan or someone who is considered to be civilized or religious (depending on the context and the speaker's bias).  However, without a context for its use, the meaning remains ambiguous and speculative.


Because "nonheathen" is not a standard word, I cannot provide grammatical examples as requested in the format.  Its usage would depend entirely on whoever coined it and the context in which they used it.  It lacks established grammatical rules, synonyms, or antonyms in the way a standard word would.
