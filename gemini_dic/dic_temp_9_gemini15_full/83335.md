USAGE->
This word is a possessive noun and doesn't conjugate like verbs.  Its usage is solely to show possession.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "gypsy's" due to its offensive nature and the preference for alternative terms.  Phrases using "Roma's" or "Romany's" would be more appropriate and acceptable.  For example, "Roma's traditions" or "Romany's music".


NOTE:  The term "gypsy" has a controversial history and is considered a derogatory and offensive term by many.  Its origin is unclear, but it is believed to be derived from the Egyptian word "gyptians" which was used to refer to Egyptians who were often mistaken for Roma people.  The use of "gypsy" should be avoided and replaced with more respectful terms like "Roma," "Romany," or other self-identified terms used by the people themselves depending on their specific ethnic group.  The word "gypsy" is often used to describe a nomadic lifestyle, but associating this with the Roma people perpetuates harmful stereotypes.
