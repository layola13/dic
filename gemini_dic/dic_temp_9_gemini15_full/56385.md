The word "dolcest" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a word like "doltish" (meaning foolish or stupid),  "dolorous" (meaning sorrowful or mournful), or a word from another language.

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a slang term, or a word specific to a particular dialect or community.  More context is needed to understand its meaning and usage.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or a place name.
