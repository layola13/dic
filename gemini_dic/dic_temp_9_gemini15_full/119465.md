micrometeorites:/ˌmaɪkroʊˈmiːtiəraɪts/| n. |微陨石|Extremely small meteoroids that survive atmospheric entry and reach the Earth's surface. They are too small to be seen with the naked eye and are often found in polar ice or deep-sea sediments.|例句：Scientists are studying micrometeorites collected from the Antarctic ice sheet to understand early solar system formation. 科学家们正在研究从南极冰盖收集的微陨石，以了解早期太阳系的形成。|近义词：cosmic dust, space dust|反义词：meteor, meteorite (larger counterparts)
