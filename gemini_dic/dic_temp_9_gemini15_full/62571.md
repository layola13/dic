词源:
The word "energizing" is derived from the noun "energy" and the suffix "-izing," which creates an adjective indicating the act or process of something. "Energy" itself comes from the Greek word "energeia," meaning "activity," "operation," or "efficiency," ultimately deriving from "energos," meaning "active" or "working."  Therefore, "energizing" literally means "making active" or "making efficient."
