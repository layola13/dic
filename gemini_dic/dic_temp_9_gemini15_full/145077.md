词源:
The word is formed from the adverbial suffix "-ly" added to the adjective "overanimated".  "Over-" is a prefix indicating "too much" or "excessively," while "animated" derives from the verb "animate," meaning "to give life or energy to." Therefore, "overanimated" means "excessively lively or energetic," and adding "-ly" transforms it into an adverb describing how something is done.  The root of "animate" traces back to the Latin word "anima," meaning "soul" or "life."
