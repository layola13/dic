nonintercepting: /ˌnɒnɪnˈsɛptɪŋ/ | adj. | 非相交的，不相交的 | Not intersecting; not meeting or crossing.  This term is typically used in mathematical and geometrical contexts to describe lines, planes, or other objects that do not share any common points. | Example: The two lines are nonintercepting, meaning they are parallel. 这两条线不相交，这意味着它们是平行的。 | 近义词: disjoint, parallel, separate | 反义词: intersecting, crossing


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The two lines are nonintercepting. = 这两条线不相交。
The paths of the two objects remain nonintercepting. = 这两个物体的路径保持不相交。


一般过去时:
The lines were nonintercepting throughout the experiment. = 在整个实验过程中，这些线不相交。
The trajectories of the rockets were nonintercepting. = 火箭的轨迹不相交。


现在完成时:
The research has shown that the two systems have remained nonintercepting. = 研究表明这两个系统一直保持不相交。
The analysis has confirmed that the paths are nonintercepting. = 分析证实路径不相交。


过去完成时:
Before the collision, the particles had been nonintercepting. = 在碰撞之前，粒子是不相交的。
The planes had been nonintercepting until the last moment. = 直到最后一刻，飞机才不相交。


将来时:
The satellites will remain nonintercepting. = 卫星将保持不相交。
The planned flight paths will be nonintercepting. = 计划中的飞行路径将不相交。


虚拟语气:
If the lines were nonintercepting, the result would be different. = 如果线不相交，结果将会不同。
I wish the trajectories had been nonintercepting. = 我希望轨迹不相交。


被动语态:
The nonintercepting nature of the lines was confirmed. = 线的不相交性质得到了证实。
It was determined that the paths were nonintercepting. = 已确定路径不相交。


疑问句:
Are the lines nonintercepting? = 这些线不相交吗？
Were the trajectories nonintercepting? = 轨迹不相交吗？


否定句:
The lines are not nonintercepting; they intersect. = 这些线不相交；它们相交。
The paths were not nonintercepting; they collided. = 路径不相交；它们相撞。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "nonintercepting" due to its technical nature.  The word is primarily used in its standalone form within technical contexts.
