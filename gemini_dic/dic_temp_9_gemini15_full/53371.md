词源:  The word "disaffirmance" is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the word "affirmance," which in turn comes from the verb "affirm" (to state positively; to confirm).  Therefore, "disaffirmance" literally means "the act of not affirming" or "the act of rejecting an affirmation."  The legal context adds the specific meaning of rejecting a contract or agreement.
