词源:

The term "self-ownership" is a relatively modern term, emerging from philosophical discussions in the late 20th century.  It combines "self," referring to oneself as an individual, and "ownership," implying control and dominion.  The roots of the concept, however, can be traced back to much earlier ideas about individual liberty and autonomy found in various philosophical traditions.
