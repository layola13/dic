neutrophil:/ˈnjuːtrəfɪl/| n. |中性粒细胞|A type of white blood cell that is a key component of the innate immune system.  Neutrophils are phagocytic, meaning they engulf and destroy pathogens such as bacteria and fungi. They are the most abundant type of white blood cell in the blood. |例句：The high neutrophil count in his blood test indicated an infection.  他的验血结果中性粒细胞数量很高，表明有感染。|例句：Neutrophils are crucial in the body's first line of defense against invading microorganisms. 中性粒细胞在机体抵御入侵微生物的第一道防线中至关重要。|近义词：leukocyte (white blood cell), granulocyte|反义词：None specifically, but terms referring to other types of white blood cells could be considered contrasting, such as lymphocyte or eosinophil.|名词

词源:

The word "neutrophil" comes from the combination of "neutro-" (meaning "neutral" referring to their staining properties) and "-phil" (meaning "loving" or "attracted to," referring to their attraction to certain dyes).  The name reflects their appearance under a microscope using specific stains.
