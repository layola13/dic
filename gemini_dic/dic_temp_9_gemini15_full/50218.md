PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "depasture".  The verb itself is relatively formal and less frequently used in everyday speech compared to synonyms like "graze" or "feed."  However, phrases could be constructed such as:  "depasture on the hillside", "depasture the flock", "depasture the herd in the meadow", "carefully depasture", "properly depasture".


词源:
The word "depasture" comes from the Old French word "depasturer," which itself is derived from the Latin "pastus," meaning "pasture" or "food," and the prefix "de-," indicating "down" or "away" (as in to consume the pasture).  Therefore, the etymology suggests a complete consumption or thorough feeding of the available pasture.
