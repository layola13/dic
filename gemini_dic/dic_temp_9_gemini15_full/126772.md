nanobacterium:/ˌnænəʊbækˈtɪəriəm/ | n. | 纳米细菌 | A hypothetical type of extremely small bacterium, sometimes proposed as a cause of certain diseases, but whose existence is not yet definitively proven.  The term is often used to describe bacteria that are smaller than the resolving power of standard light microscopes and thus difficult to observe directly.  There is ongoing debate about their true nature and significance. | Example:  The research paper suggested that nanobacteria might play a role in kidney stone formation, but this hypothesis remains controversial.  纳米细菌的研究论文表明，纳米细菌可能在肾结石的形成中起作用，但这仍然是一个有争议的假设。| 近义词:  microbe, microorganism | 反义词:  macroscopic organism |  词性: noun
