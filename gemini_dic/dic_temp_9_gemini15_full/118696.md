metacenter:/ˈmɛtəˌsɛntər/| n. |形心|The metacenter is the point of intersection of the line of action of the buoyant force with the centerline of a floating body when the body is inclined.  It's a crucial concept in naval architecture and hydrostatics, determining the stability of a floating object.  The position of the metacenter relative to the center of gravity dictates whether the object will right itself or capsize when tilted. |The metacenter of this ship is high enough to ensure its stability. 这艘船的形心足够高以确保其稳定性。|近义词：center of buoyancy (in a specific context)|反义词：N/A
