The word "shole" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps you could provide more context where you encountered this word.  Knowing the context might help determine the intended word.

2. **It's a dialectal word or slang:**  Some words are used only in specific regions or communities.  Without more information, it's impossible to define it.

3. **It's a newly coined word:**  New words are created all the time. However, without widespread usage and acceptance, it wouldn't be found in dictionaries.

4. **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name or place name, not a standard word.
