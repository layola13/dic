left-wingism: /ˈlɛft wɪŋɪzəm/ | n. | 左翼主义 |

英文解析:Left-wingism refers to the political ideology and set of practices associated with the left wing of the political spectrum.  It encompasses a broad range of beliefs and approaches, generally characterized by a commitment to social equality, social justice, and often, government intervention to address economic and social inequalities. Specific policies advocated by left-wingers vary widely depending on the context and specific ideology, but common themes include support for workers' rights, progressive taxation, social welfare programs, environmental protection, and sometimes, socialist or communist ideals.  However, it's crucial to note that "left-wingism" is often used pejoratively, implying extremism or impracticality, rather than a neutral description of left-wing political thought.
