WORD ORIGIN->
The word "creativeness" is derived from the adjective "creative," which comes from the verb "create."  "Create" ultimately traces back to the Latin word "creare," meaning "to create, make, bring into existence."  The suffix "-ness" is added to form the noun, indicating a state or quality.
