词源:

The word "haberdashery" ultimately derives from the Old French word "haberdasher,"  meaning a seller of smallwares.  This in turn is thought to be of uncertain origin, possibly related to the Old French "haubergeon" (a type of medieval coat of mail), suggesting an early association with the sale of military or protective clothing items.  Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass the general retail of men's clothing and sewing supplies.
