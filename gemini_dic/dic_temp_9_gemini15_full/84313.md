词源:

* **half-**:  Prefix meaning "partly" or "to a certain extent."  Originating from Old English *healf, *half.

* **willful**: Adjective meaning "intentional," "deliberate," or "stubborn."  Derived from "will" + "-ful" (a suffix indicating "full of").  The word "will" traces back to Old English *willa, meaning "desire" or "intention."

* **-ness**: Suffix forming nouns of state or condition.  Derived from Old English *-nes.


Therefore, "half-willfulness" combines the idea of "partly" with the quality of being "willful," resulting in a word describing a partial or incomplete intentionality, often mixed with stubbornness or disregard for consequences.
