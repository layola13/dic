词源:
The word "butterscotch" combines "butter" and "scotch." The "scotch" part is believed to refer to a type of sugar or possibly a method of candy-making, though its exact origin within the word's etymology remains somewhat debated.  The name likely emerged in the 19th century as the candy gained popularity.
