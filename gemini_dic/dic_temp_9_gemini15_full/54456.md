词源:
The word "disinhibitory" is derived from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "removal of" or "opposite of"), the verb "inhibit" (meaning "to restrain, hinder, or prevent"), and the suffix "-ory" (meaning "relating to" or "tending to").  Therefore, "disinhibitory" literally means "relating to the removal of inhibition."
