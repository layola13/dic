词源:
The word "sermonlike" is a compound word formed from "sermon" and the suffix "-like."  "Sermon" comes from Old French "sermon," ultimately from Latin "sermo," meaning "speech, conversation, discourse."  The "-like" suffix indicates resemblance or similarity.  Thus, "sermonlike" means "resembling a sermon."
