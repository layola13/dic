词源:

The word "counterculturalism" is a relatively modern term, combining "counter" (meaning against or opposite) with "culturalism" (relating to culture).  The root of "culture" traces back to the Latin word "cultura," meaning cultivation or refinement. Therefore, counterculturalism literally means a movement or philosophy that opposes or challenges established cultural norms and practices.
