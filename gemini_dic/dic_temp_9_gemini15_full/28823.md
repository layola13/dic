词源:
The word "carouse" ultimately derives from the Middle Dutch word "crusen," meaning "to drink hard."  This word itself has roots in the Old French word "croiser," which means "to cross" or "to drink a toast." The meaning evolved to encompass the entire act of revelry associated with heavy drinking.
