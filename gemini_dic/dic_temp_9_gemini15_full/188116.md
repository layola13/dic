词源:
The word "roundtable" is a compound word combining "round" (referring to the shape of the table) and "table" (referring to the piece of furniture).  Its usage reflects the medieval Arthurian legends, where King Arthur and his knights sat at a round table to promote equality and avoid hierarchy.  The modern usage retains this connotation of equal participation and open dialogue.
