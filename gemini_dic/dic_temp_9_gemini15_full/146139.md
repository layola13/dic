词源:

* **over-**:  prefix meaning "too much," "excessively," or "beyond." (来自表示“太多”、“过度”或“超出”的前缀)
* **emulate**: verb meaning "to match or surpass (typically by imitation)." (动词，意为“匹配或超越（通常通过模仿）”)  This word itself has Latin roots, stemming from *aemulus* meaning "rival." (这个词本身有拉丁词根，源于 *aemulus*，意为“竞争对手”。)
* **-ed**: past participle suffix, indicating a completed action or state. (过去分词后缀，表示完成的动作或状态。)

因此，overemulated 表示对某种东西进行了过度的模仿。 (Therefore, overemulated means having imitated something to an excessive degree.)
