elatery:/ˈɛlətəri/ | n. | 弹射器；（某些植物的）弹射胞；（昆虫的）弹器 |  The elatery is a mechanism for dispersal of spores in some plants, using the sudden release of tension to catapult them. It also refers to the clicking mechanism in certain insects, such as click beetles, allowing them to right themselves when flipped onto their backs. | Example: The elatery of the fern propelled the spores several feet.  = 蕨类的弹射器将孢子弹射出几英尺。 The click beetle used its elatery to flip itself over. = 叩头虫用它的弹器翻过身来。 | 近义词：ejaculator, catapult (for the plant mechanism) | 反义词：None directly applicable.


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The elatery propels spores. = 弹射器弹射孢子。
The elatery functions well in dry conditions. = 弹射器在干燥条件下功能良好。


一般过去时:
The elatery propelled the spores far. = 弹射器将孢子弹射得很远。
The elatery failed to function properly. = 弹射器未能正常工作。


现在完成时:
The plant has developed an efficient elatery. = 植物已经进化出高效的弹射器。
The scientist has studied the elatery's mechanism. = 科学家已经研究了弹射器的机制。


过去完成时:
The spores had already been dispersed by the elatery. = 孢子已经被弹射器弹射出去了。
The beetle had used its elatery to escape. = 甲虫已经用它的弹器逃脱了。


将来时:
The elatery will disperse the spores effectively. = 弹射器将有效地散播孢子。
Researchers will further investigate the elatery's properties. = 研究人员将进一步研究弹射器的特性。


虚拟语气:
If the elatery were stronger, the spores would travel further. = 如果弹射器更强壮，孢子就会飞得更远。
I wish the elatery mechanism were better understood. = 我希望弹射器的机制能够更好地被理解。


被动语态:
The spores are propelled by the elatery. = 孢子由弹射器弹射。
The elatery's function is being studied. = 弹射器的功能正在被研究。


疑问句:
How does the elatery work? = 弹射器是如何工作的？
What triggers the elatery's release? = 什么触发了弹射器的释放？


否定句:
The elatery did not function correctly. = 弹射器没有正常工作。
The spores were not dispersed effectively by the elatery. = 孢子没有被弹射器有效地散播。
