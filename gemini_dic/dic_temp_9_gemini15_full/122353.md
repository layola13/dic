The word "mixrs" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), an abbreviation, or a word from a specialized field.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  To assist you, I need more context about where you encountered this word.  For example, telling me the sentence or text where it appeared would help determine its meaning and possible origin.
