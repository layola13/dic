The word "melligo" is not found in standard English dictionaries or etymological resources.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, word class, meaning, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical examples as requested.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you intended a different word.
* **It's a neologism:** It might be a newly coined word, a technical term, a word from a specific dialect or jargon, or a proper noun.
* **It's a word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language that hasn't been widely adopted into English.

If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer further assistance.
