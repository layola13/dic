/ˌoʊvərˈkɑːmənəsɪz/ | n. | 过于普遍的事物；过于常见的事物 |  The word "overcommonnesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a newly coined word, formed by combining "over-" (meaning excessive or too much) with "commonnesses" (the plural of "commonness," meaning the quality of being common or ordinary).  Therefore, a direct definition and usage examples are not readily available.  Its meaning would be derived from its constituent parts. It suggests things that are excessively or unusually common, to a degree that is noteworthy or perhaps even problematic. |  Example: *The overcommonnesses of modern design led to a lack of originality.* (This is a made-up example illustrating a potential usage) | 近义词:  overused clichés, ubiquitous trends, commonplace occurrences | 反义词:  rare occurrences, unique features, novelties | n.
