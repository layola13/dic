词源:
The word "overdrawn" is formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "beyond" or "exceeding") and the past participle "drawn" of the verb "draw," which in this context refers to withdrawing money from an account.  Therefore, "overdrawn" literally means "having had more money drawn out than was available."
