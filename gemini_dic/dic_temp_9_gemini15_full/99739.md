intermaxilla: /ˌɪntərˈmæksɪlə/ | n. | 犁骨 | The intermaxilla is the premaxilla in mammals, a bone or bones in the upper jaw that support the incisor teeth.  It's a crucial element in the development of the vertebrate skull, particularly in the evolution of the mammalian jaw. In some species, it fuses with other bones of the maxilla during development.  | Example: The study focused on the development and ossification of the intermaxilla in different mammalian species.  研究重点是不同哺乳动物物种犁骨的发育和骨化。|近义词: premaxilla (in mammals) |反义词:  (no direct antonym, but contrasting terms could include maxilla or mandible)|名词
