词源:  The word "idiosyncratical" is derived from the Greek words "idios" (ἴδιος), meaning "own" or "private," and "synkrasis" (σύνκρασις), meaning "a mixing together" or "temperament."  It originally referred to a peculiar temperament or constitution of a person, later broadening to encompass any unique characteristic.
