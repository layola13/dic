词源:  The word "peremptoriness" derives from the Late Latin word *peremptorius*, which means "decisive," "conclusive," or "that which cuts off all debate."  This, in turn, comes from the Latin verb *perimere*, meaning "to destroy," "to kill," or "to extinguish." The sense of finality and decisiveness inherent in the Latin root has carried through to the modern English meaning.
