词源:

The word "daft" ultimately derives from Old English *dæf, meaning "deaf" or "dull of hearing".  Over time, the meaning shifted to denote someone who is mentally slow or lacking in understanding, eventually evolving into its current meaning of silly or foolish.  The semantic shift likely reflects the association between impaired hearing and perceived lack of intelligence.


用法说明:

"Daft" is an informal adjective used to describe something foolish, silly, or absurd. It's often used in a light-hearted way, but it can also carry a stronger connotation of foolishness, depending on the context.  It's predominantly used in British English.
