词源：
The word "dict" is a shortened form of "dictionary."  The word "dictionary" itself comes from the Medieval Latin word "dictionarium," which in turn is derived from the Late Latin "dictio," meaning "speech" or "word."  This ultimately traces back to the Latin verb "dicere," meaning "to say" or "to speak."
