The word "chenu" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:** Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name (person, place, or thing) not found in general dictionaries.
* **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a word specific to a particular region or community, or slang not yet widely documented.
* **It's from another language:**  The word might originate from a different language. If you can provide the language of origin, I might be able to help.

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you'd like me to assist further.
