词源:
The word "casserole" comes from the French word "casserole," which originally referred to a type of earthenware pot used for cooking.  The word ultimately derives from the Occitan word "cassola," meaning "earthenware pot."  The English word adopted the meaning of both the cooking pot and the dish cooked within it.
