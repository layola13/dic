词源:

The word "overstretching" is a combination of "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and "stretching" (the act of extending something).  "Stretching" itself originates from the Old English word "streccan," meaning "to stretch."  Therefore, "overstretching" literally means "stretching too much."
