palliobranchiata: /ˌpæliˌoʊbræŋˈkiːətə/ | n. |古鰓類 |  A subclass of bivalve mollusks characterized by having a mantle cavity that extends posteriorly beyond the visceral mass, often with a pair of siphons for inhaling and exhaling water.  They are mostly extinct, with only a few extant species.  |  The fossil record shows a wide diversity of palliobranchiata. = 化石记录显示了大量的古鳃类。  The study of palliobranchiata provides insights into the evolution of bivalves. = 对古鳃类的研究为了解双壳类动物的进化提供了见解。 | 近义词:  (lacks direct synonyms due to taxonomic specificity) | 反义词: (lacks direct antonyms due to taxonomic specificity)
