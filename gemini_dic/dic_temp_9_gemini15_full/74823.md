The word "frender" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), slang, or a word specific to a particular context or community.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown is not possible.  To provide the requested information, I need a correct word.

If you meant a different word, please provide the correct spelling.  If "frender" is a newly coined term, please provide context for its use.
