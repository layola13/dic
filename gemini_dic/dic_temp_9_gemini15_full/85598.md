hatters:/ˈhætərz/| n. |帽子制造商；疯子（旧用法）|A hatter is a person who makes or sells hats.  The term also has an archaic meaning referring to someone considered mad or eccentric, possibly stemming from the use of mercury in hat-making in the past. |例句：My grandfather was a hatter, crafting exquisite top hats for the wealthy. 我爷爷是一位帽子制造商，为富人制作精美的礼帽。

例句：In Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland," the Mad Hatter is a prime example of the word's archaic meaning. 在刘易斯卡罗尔的《爱丽丝梦游仙境》中，疯帽子匠是该词古义的典型例子。


近义词：milliner (for women's hats), capmaker


反义词：无


词源：源自古英语 *hattere，意为“帽子制造者”。  The association with madness is linked to historical hat-making practices involving mercury, which caused mercury poisoning and neurological symptoms.
