词源:

The word "reframing" is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "anew") and the verb "framing."  "Framing," in this context, refers to the way something is presented or structured, similar to how a picture is framed within a border.  The root of "frame" comes from Old French "framer" (to shape, build), ultimately from Latin "firmare" (to strengthen, make firm).
