porphyritic:/ˌpɔːrfɪˈrɪtɪk/| adj.|斑状的；斑岩质的|Containing conspicuous crystals of one or more minerals embedded in a finer-grained groundmass.  This texture is characteristic of igneous rocks that have undergone two stages of cooling, with larger crystals forming during a slower initial cooling phase and smaller crystals forming during a faster final cooling phase.|The granite sample showed a distinct porphyritic texture, with large feldspar crystals scattered throughout a finer matrix.|近义词：macrocrystalline|反义词：aphanitic

例句:

The porphyritic texture of the rock indicates a complex cooling history.  =  岩石的斑状结构表明其具有复杂的冷却历史。

This volcanic rock exhibits a porphyritic structure with large quartz phenocrysts. =  这种火山岩呈现出斑状结构，其中含有大型石英斑晶。


词源:

From Greek *porphýrēs* ("purple," "purple stone"), referring to the purple porphyry stone used in ancient times. The term's application extended to describe the characteristic texture of rocks with large crystals in a finer-grained matrix.


用法说明：

Porphyritic is primarily used as an adjective in geology and petrology to describe the texture of igneous rocks.  It does not have verb or noun forms in common usage.  The term refers specifically to the presence of large, distinct crystals (phenocrysts) within a finer-grained matrix (groundmass).  The size difference between the phenocrysts and the groundmass is a key characteristic of a porphyritic texture.  This texture arises from two stages of cooling, with the larger crystals forming during a slower initial phase and the finer-grained matrix forming during a faster final phase.
