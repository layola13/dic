PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "photosynthesizes".  The verb is typically used in its base form within scientific or biological contexts.  Phrases would revolve around the *process* of photosynthesis, not the verb itself.  For example:

Photosynthetic rate = 光合速率
Photosynthetic efficiency = 光合效率
Photosynthetic pigments = 光合色素
Light-dependent photosynthesis = 光依赖性光合作用
Light-independent photosynthesis = 光非依赖性光合作用
