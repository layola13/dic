semihibernations:/ˌsɛmihaɪbərˈneɪʃənz/ | n. | 半冬眠状态；部分冬眠 | A state of reduced activity and metabolism, similar to but less extreme than true hibernation.  It often involves decreased body temperature, heart rate, and metabolic rate, but the animal remains more responsive to stimuli than during true hibernation.  Semihibernation is a strategy employed by some animals to conserve energy during periods of resource scarcity or unfavorable environmental conditions. | Example:  Bears exhibit semihibernations during winter, occasionally waking up and moving around.  熊在冬天表现出半冬眠状态，偶尔会醒来四处走动。|近义词：torpor, lethargy, dormancy |反义词：activity, hyperactivity |名词
