USAGE->

This word is extremely rare and doesn't have common usage examples across different tenses or grammatical structures like "what" does.  Its usage is limited to academic or highly specialized contexts discussing suggestibility.  Therefore, providing examples across various tenses would be artificial and misleading.

A more appropriate approach would be to demonstrate how the word functions in a sentence and explore related concepts:

Example Sentence 1:

The researchers attributed the unexpected conformity of the group to their collective hypersuggestiblenesses. 研究人员将该群体的意外从众归因于他们高度的易受暗示性。


Example Sentence 2:

Further investigation is needed to understand the underlying neurological mechanisms contributing to these hypersuggestiblenesses. 需要进一步研究以了解导致这种高度易受暗示性的潜在神经机制。


PHRASE->

Phrases using "hypersuggestiblenesses" are unlikely to exist due to its rarity.  Instead, related phrases focusing on suggestibility would be more relevant:

* high degree of suggestibility: 高度的易受暗示性
* susceptibility to suggestion: 易受暗示性
* under the influence of suggestion: 在暗示的影响下
* prone to suggestion: 易受暗示
* level of suggestibility: 易受暗示的程度


Note:  The word "hypersuggestiblenesses" is formed by adding "-nesses" (a pluralizing suffix indicating a state or condition) to "hypersuggestible" (itself a combination of "hyper-" meaning excessive and "suggestible" meaning easily influenced).  The word is highly uncommon and is unlikely to be encountered in everyday conversation or general writing.
