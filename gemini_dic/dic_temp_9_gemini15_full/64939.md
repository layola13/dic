词源:
The word "established" comes from the verb "establish," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "establir," meaning "to establish, to settle, to institute."  This in turn has roots in the Latin "stabilire," meaning "to make firm, to strengthen." The prefix "stab-" relates to the word "stable."
