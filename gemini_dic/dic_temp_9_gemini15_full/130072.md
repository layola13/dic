non-predicative: /ˌnɒn prɪˈdɪkətɪv/ | adj. |非谓语的|  Not functioning as a predicate; not forming part of the predicate of a sentence.  This term is primarily used in linguistics and grammar to describe elements within a sentence that do not act as the verb phrase (the predicate).  It contrasts with predicative, which describes elements that do form part of the predicate.  Non-predicative elements can include subjects, objects, complements, and adverbials, depending on their function within the sentence's structure.


例句：

The adjective "happy" is non-predicative in the sentence "I saw a happy dog." = 在句子“我看到一只快乐的狗”中，形容词“快乐的”是非谓语的。


The noun phrase "my new car" is non-predicative in the sentence "I bought my new car." = 在句子“我买了我的新车”中，名词短语“我的新车”是非谓语的。
