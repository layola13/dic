英文解析: Cross-sectioning refers to the process of cutting or viewing something (an object, a region, a group, etc.) to reveal its internal structure, typically in a plane perpendicular to its longest dimension.  It can be a literal act of cutting, or a metaphorical representation of examining a representative sample of a larger whole.
