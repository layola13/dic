quasi-hereditary:/ˈkwɑːziˌhɛrɪˈtɛri/| adj.|拟遗传的；准遗传的 |Quasi-hereditary refers to a property of certain algebraic structures, particularly in representation theory, that exhibits some but not all of the characteristics of a hereditary algebra.  It signifies a structure that possesses a weakened form of heredity, often involving a partial ordering on the set of simple modules.  This weaker condition allows for more flexibility and broader applicability than strict heredity. | Example: "The category of modules over a quasi-hereditary algebra has a particularly nice structure."  = “准遗传代数上的模范畴具有一个特别好的结构。”|近义词：partially hereditary (部分遗传的)|反义词：hereditary (遗传的)


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in advanced mathematical contexts, specifically within abstract algebra and representation theory. Therefore, providing examples across various tenses and grammatical structures is not practical. The usage is almost exclusively within technical writing and academic papers.

A typical usage example in a sentence:

"This paper explores the properties of quasi-hereditary algebras and their applications to the representation theory of Lie algebras." = 本文探讨了准遗传代数的性质及其在李代数表示理论中的应用。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "quasi-hereditary".  The term is highly specialized.
