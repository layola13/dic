nonblocking: /ˌnɒnˈblɒkɪŋ/ | adj. | 非阻塞的，异步的 |  Not requiring a process to wait for a response before continuing.  This term is often used in programming and describes operations that don't pause the execution of a program while waiting for a result.  Instead, the program continues to execute other tasks, and the result of the non-blocking operation is handled later, typically through a callback or event notification. |


例句：

The asynchronous I/O operation is non-blocking, allowing the program to continue working while waiting for data. = 异步I/O操作是非阻塞的，允许程序在等待数据的同时继续工作。

Our system uses a non-blocking socket to handle multiple clients simultaneously. = 我们的系统使用非阻塞套接字来同时处理多个客户端。
