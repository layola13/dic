词源：The word is a relatively recent addition to the English lexicon, originating in British English.  It's believed to be a combination of "gob" (mouth) and "smacked" (hit hard), implying a feeling of being so shocked that one's mouth is literally "smack" or hit shut in surprise.  The exact origin is uncertain, but its usage reflects the evolution of colloquial speech.
