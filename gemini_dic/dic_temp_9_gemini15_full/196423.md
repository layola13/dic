词源:  The word "serpentlike" is a compound adjective formed from "serpent" and "-like."  "Serpent" originates from Old French "serpent," ultimately from Latin "serpens," the present participle of "serpere," meaning "to creep" or "to crawl."  The suffix "-like" indicates resemblance or similarity.  Therefore, "serpentlike" literally means "like a serpent."
