词源:

The term "candy floss" is a blend of "candy" (a general term for sweets) and "floss," which refers to something soft, fluffy, or filamentous.  The "floss" part likely comes from the resemblance of the spun sugar to dental floss.  "Cotton candy" uses the visual similarity of the spun sugar to cotton.
