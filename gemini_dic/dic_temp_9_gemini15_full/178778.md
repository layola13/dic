recumbences:/rɪˈkʌmbənsiz/ | n. | 卧姿；躺卧；斜倚 | The word "recumbences" is rarely used in modern English. It refers to the act or state of reclining or lying down, often in a relaxed or comfortable position.  It implies a state of rest or repose.  While grammatically correct, it's considered overly formal and archaic.  More common synonyms would be preferred in most contexts. | The elderly woman enjoyed the recumbences of her favorite armchair.  年迈的妇人享受着最爱的扶手椅带来的舒适躺卧。  |  reclining, lying down, repose | standing, sitting, upright | 名词
