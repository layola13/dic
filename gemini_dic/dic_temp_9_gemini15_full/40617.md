词源:
Convenience comes from the Old French word *convenance*, meaning "suitability, appropriateness."  This in turn derives from the Latin word *convenientia*, a noun formed from the present participle of *convenire*, meaning "to come together, agree, be suitable."  The sense of "ease" or "readiness" developed over time from the original meaning of "suitability."
