Etymology:

The word "ramus" comes from the Latin word meaning "branch".  It's related to other words like "ramify" (to branch out) and "ramose" (branched).  The anatomical and botanical use of the word directly reflects its Latin origin, where it was used to describe branching structures in plants and the human body.
