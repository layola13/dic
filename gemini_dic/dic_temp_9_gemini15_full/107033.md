lactimide: /ˈlæktɪmaɪd/ | n. |内酰胺 |A cyclic amide derived from a lactone by replacing the oxygen atom with an NH group.  Lactides are cyclic esters formed by the condensation of two molecules of alpha-hydroxy acid, while lactimides are their nitrogen analogs, replacing the ester oxygen with an -NH group. They are often found in various chemical and biological contexts.|The synthesis of lactimides involves the reaction of lactones with ammonia or amines.  |近义词: cyclic amide,  |反义词:  (No direct antonym exists)
