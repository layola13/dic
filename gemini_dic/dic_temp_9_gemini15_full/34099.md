词源:
Civilnesses derives from the adjective "civil," meaning "polite," "courteous," or "civilized."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality.  The word's roots trace back to the Latin word "civilis," sharing the same meaning of "of or relating to citizens" and by extension, "polite" and "orderly."
