The word "secest" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure dialect.  If you could provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a better explanation or guess at its intended meaning.
