Its etymology is uncertain, but it's possibly related to the word "crank," which can refer to a mechanical device or a person who is eccentric or odd.  The sense of being irritable or bad-tempered likely developed from the association of a "crank" with something that is difficult to operate or is prone to malfunctioning, mirroring a person's difficult or unpredictable behavior.
