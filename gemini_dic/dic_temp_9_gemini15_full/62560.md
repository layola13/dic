词源:

The word "energies" is the plural form of "energy."  "Energy" ultimately derives from the Greek word  ἐνέργεια (energeia), meaning "activity," "operation," or "working." This, in turn, comes from the verb  ἐνέργω (energo), meaning "I work in," "I am active."  The suffix "-ia" is a noun-forming suffix in Greek.  The word entered English through French during the 17th century, reflecting its scientific and philosophical development.
