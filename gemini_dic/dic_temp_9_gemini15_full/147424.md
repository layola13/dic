USAGE->

This word is extremely rare and doesn't lend itself to typical grammatical tense examples as demonstrated in your example for "what".  The word itself is a noun and functions as a singular entity representing a large quantity.  Therefore, standard tense usage is not applicable.  The following demonstrates how it is used in a sentence and slight variations.


Present Simple: The overnumerousness of applications is overwhelming.  申请数量过多，令人难以招架。

Present Perfect: The overnumerousness of problems has proven to be a significant hurdle.  问题的过量已被证明是一个巨大的障碍。


Past Simple: The overnumerousness of the troops hindered their maneuverability.  军队人数过多妨碍了他们的机动性。


Past Perfect:  The overnumerousness of the guests had already strained the resources of the party.  宾客人数过多已经使派对资源紧张。

Future Simple: The overnumerousness of orders is expected to increase production costs.  订单过多预计会增加生产成本。


PHRASE->

There are no common phrases directly using "overnumerousness".  The word itself is so uncommon that it's rarely used in idiomatic expressions.  Phrases would need to be constructed around the concept of excess or superfluity. For example:


An overabundance of...  (过量的...)
A superfluity of... (过剩的...)
An excess of... (过多的...)
A plethora of... (大量的...)
Too many... (太多的...)


The rarity of the word "overnumerousnesses" means that providing a detailed grammatical analysis across all tenses is impractical. Its use is confined to very specific contexts dealing with exceptionally large quantities.
