词源:
The word "disentrammel" is a relatively rare word formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away from" or "the opposite of"), and "entrammel" (meaning "to ensnare" or "to restrict").  "Entrammel" itself has origins in Middle English, ultimately deriving from Old French words relating to nets and snares.
