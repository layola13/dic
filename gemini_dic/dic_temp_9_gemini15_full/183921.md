词源:
The word "reserve" comes from the Old French word "reserver," meaning "to keep back," "to retain," or "to save." This Old French word, in turn, is derived from the Latin word "reservare," which has a similar meaning.  The Latin word is formed from the prefix "re-" (again, back) and the verb "servare" (to keep, to preserve).
