词源:
The word is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "imperialistic" (relating to imperialism, a policy of extending a country's power and influence through diplomacy or military force).  "Imperialistic" in turn derives from "imperial" (relating to an empire) and "-istic" (forming adjectives meaning "of the nature of").  The root of "imperial" traces back to the Latin word "imperium," meaning "command," "power," or "rule."
