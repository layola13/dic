self-motions:/ˈsɛlf ˈmoʊʃənz/ | n. |自身运动，自主运动 | Movements or actions performed by an organism or system without external influence or control.  These motions are often inherent to the system's structure or internal processes.  For example, the self-motions of a robot might refer to its internal movements, such as adjustments to its posture or internal components, as opposed to external movements like walking or turning.  In biology, self-motions can refer to the intrinsic movements of cells or molecules. | Example: The robot's self-motions helped it maintain balance while navigating the uneven terrain.  = 机器人的自身运动帮助它在崎岖的地形上保持平衡。 The self-motions of the bacteria were studied under a microscope. = 细菌的自身运动在显微镜下被研究。|近义词：intrinsic movements, autonomous movements, spontaneous movements |反义词：externally driven movements, controlled movements | noun


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The robot executes its self-motions smoothly. = 机器人流畅地执行其自身运动。
The cells exhibit complex self-motions. = 细胞表现出复杂的自身运动。

一般过去时:
The pendulum completed its self-motions. = 钟摆完成了它的摆动。

将来时:
The robot will perform its self-motions autonomously. = 机器人将自主地执行其自身运动。
The experiment will reveal the details of the self-motions. = 实验将揭示自身运动的细节。


虚拟语气:
If the system were to undergo rapid self-motions, it might become unstable. = 如果系统发生快速的自身运动，它可能会变得不稳定。
I wish the self-motions were easier to predict. = 我希望自身运动更容易预测。


被动语态:

疑问句:
What are the primary self-motions of this organism? = 这个生物的主要自身运动是什么？
How are the self-motions controlled? = 自身运动是如何控制的？


否定句:
The machine did not exhibit any unexpected self-motions. = 机器没有表现出任何意外的自身运动。
The experiment failed to reveal the nature of the self-motions. = 实验未能揭示自身运动的本质。


PHRASE->
