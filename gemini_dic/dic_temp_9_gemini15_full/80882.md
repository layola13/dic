The word "governal" is not a standard English word. There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "governmental," "governor," or a similar word?
* **A neologism or technical term:**  It might be a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field (e.g., a technical jargon).  If this is the case, please provide more context where you encountered this word.
* **A proper noun:** It could be a proper noun, such as a place name or a person's name. Again, more context is needed.


Without further information, I cannot provide the requested analysis. Please clarify the word or provide context.
