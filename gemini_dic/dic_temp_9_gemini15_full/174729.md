The word "raah" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word?  Could you double-check the spelling?

2. **A slang term or regional dialect word:** Its meaning would depend heavily on context and location. Without more information, it's impossible to define.

3. **An invented word:** It could be a neologism, a word newly coined for a specific purpose.

4. **A transcription of a sound:** It might represent a sound effect, an exclamation, or a non-English word.  If this is the case, please provide the context where you encountered it.
