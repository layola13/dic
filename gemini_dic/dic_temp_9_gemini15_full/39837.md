词源:

Comes from the Old French word *conspirer*, meaning "to breathe together," from the Latin *conspirare*, formed from *con-* (together) + *spirare* (to breathe).  The original meaning referred to a shared breath or secret agreement.  The modern meaning evolved from this original sense of shared secret action.
