half-conservative:/ˌhɑːf kənˈsɜːvətɪv/| adj. |半保留的|Describing a process, especially DNA replication, where one strand of the original DNA molecule is conserved in each of the two new molecules.  The new DNA molecules are thus composed of one original strand and one newly synthesized strand.|Example: DNA replication is a half-conservative process.|近义词:semiconservative|反义词:conservative, dispersive


USAGE->

The experiment demonstrated the half-conservative nature of DNA replication. = 实验证明了DNA复制的半保留性质。


现在完成时:
Researchers have confirmed that DNA replication is a half-conservative process. = 研究人员已经证实DNA复制是一个半保留的过程。
The scientific community has accepted the half-conservative model of DNA replication. = 科学界已经接受了DNA复制的半保留模型。


过去完成时:

Scientists had hypothesized several models before the half-conservative model was proven. = 在半保留模型被证实之前，科学家们已经假设过几种模型。


将来时:
Future research will continue to explore the intricacies of half-conservative replication. = 未来的研究将继续探索半保留复制的复杂性。
We will learn more about the enzymes involved in half-conservative DNA replication. = 我们将学习更多关于参与半保留DNA复制的酶的知识。


虚拟语气:
If DNA replication were not half-conservative, the results would be different. = 如果DNA复制不是半保留的，结果就会不同。
It is unlikely that life as we know it could exist if DNA replication were not half-conservative. = 如果DNA复制不是半保留的，我们所知的生命可能就不存在了。


被动语态:
The half-conservative nature of DNA replication was demonstrated by the Meselson-Stahl experiment. = DNA复制的半保留性质是由梅塞尔森-斯塔尔实验证明的。
The mechanism of half-conservative replication is being actively studied. = 半保留复制的机制正在被积极研究。


疑问句:
Is DNA replication truly a half-conservative process? = DNA复制真的是一个半保留的过程吗？

否定句:
DNA replication is not a conservative process. = DNA复制不是一个保守的过程。
The dispersive model of DNA replication was proven incorrect; it is not half-conservative. = DNA复制的弥散模型被证明是错误的；它不是半保留的。
