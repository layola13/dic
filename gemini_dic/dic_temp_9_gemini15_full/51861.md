dextrogyrate: /ˌdɛkˈstrɒdʒəreɪt/ | adj. | 右旋的；向右旋转的 | Rotating or tending to rotate to the right.  This term is often used in chemistry and physics to describe the direction of rotation of polarized light or the chirality of molecules. |例句：The solution exhibited dextrogyrate rotation of polarized light. 该溶液表现出对偏振光的右旋旋转。

The sugar molecule displayed a dextrogyrate configuration.  该糖分子显示出右旋构型。


近义词：dextrorotatory, right-rotating | 反义词：levorotatory, left-rotating


词源:  From Latin *dexter ("right") + Greek *gyros ("circle," "ring," "turn").  The prefix "dextro-" indicates a right-handed or clockwise rotation, while "-gyrate" relates to the act of turning or rotating.

USAGE->
