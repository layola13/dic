The word "least" does not exist in isolation as a stand-alone word in standard English.  It is the superlative form of the adjective "little," and the adverb "less."  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is not possible for "{leest}" as it's not a valid word.  To provide a useful response, I will analyze "least" and "less".


**least:**

/liːst/ | adj., adv. | 最少的，最小的 | The smallest in amount, quantity, or degree.  It is used as both an adjective and an adverb. | 例句：She had the least amount of experience. 她经验最少。  He tried to make the least noise possible. 他尽量不发出声音。 | 近义词：minimum, smallest, fewest | 反义词：most, greatest, maximum | adjective, adverb


**less:**

/les/ | adj., adv. | 更少的，较少的 | A smaller amount or quantity. Used as both an adjective and an adverb.
