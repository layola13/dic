midbrain:/ˈmɪdbreɪn/ | n. | 中脑 | The midbrain is the part of the brainstem that connects the forebrain to the hindbrain.  It plays a crucial role in several functions, including vision, hearing, motor control, sleep/wake cycles, alertness, and temperature regulation.  The midbrain is a relatively small but vital structure in the brain. | Example: Damage to the midbrain can result in a variety of neurological problems, affecting vision, hearing, and motor control. 中脑损伤可能导致多种神经系统问题，影响视力、听力和运动控制。 | 近义词: mesencephalon | 反义词:  (no direct antonym, as it refers to a specific brain region) |  名词
