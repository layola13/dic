词源:

The word "dope" has a complex etymology.  Its earliest recorded usage, dating back to the 16th century, referred to a thick sauce or stew. Over time, it evolved to mean various things, including a thick liquid or paste, and then, by the 19th century, to a drug or narcotic.  The sense of "to add a substance to something" (as in "doped semiconductor") is a more recent development, related to the use of dopants in materials science.  The connection between the original meaning and the modern usages isn't immediately obvious, but the semantic shift reflects a gradual broadening of meaning over centuries.
