The word "{inunderstanding}" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a misspelling or a non-existent word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical explanations as requested in your format.  To help you, I need a correctly spelled word.
