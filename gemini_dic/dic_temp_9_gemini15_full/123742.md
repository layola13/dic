词源:
The word "moonstruck" combines "moon" and "struck."  The "struck" part implies being affected or smitten, as if by a sudden blow. The connection to the moon stems from the historical belief that the moon influences human behavior and emotions, particularly leading to madness or romantic obsession.  This belief is reflected in the term "lunatic," which is derived from "luna," the Latin word for moon.
