词源:  The word "disconcerting" comes from the verb "disconcert," which itself is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away from" or "opposite of") and the verb "concert," meaning "to arrange" or "to agree."  Originally, "concert" referred to a harmonious arrangement, so "disconcert" meant to disrupt or throw into disorder.  The adjective "disconcerting" thus describes something that causes this disruption or disorder, leading to feelings of unease.
