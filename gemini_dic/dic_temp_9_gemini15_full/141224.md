oosporangium:/ˌoʊəspoʊˈrændʒiəm/| n. |卵孢子囊 |A thick-walled, resistant structure produced by certain fungi and water molds, containing oospores.  It serves as a survival structure during unfavorable conditions. | Example: The oosporangium of *Phytophthora infestans* can survive in the soil for several years, contributing to the persistence of late blight in potato crops.  卵孢子囊，例如疫霉的卵孢子囊可以在土壤中存活数年，导致马铃薯晚疫病持续存在。|近义词：resting spore, zygosporangium (in some contexts)|反义词：N/A

USAGE->
This word is primarily used in mycology (the study of fungi) and plant pathology.  Therefore, tense usage will depend on the context of the scientific description or study.  Examples below demonstrate typical usages:


Present Simple:
The oosporangium protects the oospore from harsh environmental conditions. = 卵孢子囊保护卵孢子免受恶劣环境条件的影响。
Researchers are studying the germination of the oosporangium under different temperatures. = 研究人员正在研究卵孢子囊在不同温度下的萌发情况。


Past Simple:
The mature oosporangium released its oospores into the soil. = 成熟的卵孢子囊将卵孢子释放到土壤中。
Scientists observed the formation of oosporangia during the life cycle of the fungus. = 科学家观察了真菌生命周期中卵孢子囊的形成。


Present Perfect:
Scientists have identified several factors influencing oosporangium development. = 科学家已经确定了几个影响卵孢子囊发育的因素。
Researchers have discovered a new species with unique oosporangia morphology. = 研究人员发现了一种具有独特卵孢子囊形态的新物种。


Past Perfect:
The oosporangium had already germinated before the researchers arrived. = 在研究人员到达之前，卵孢子囊已经萌发了。
The pathogen had produced numerous oosporangia prior to the onset of symptoms. = 在症状出现之前，病原体已经产生了大量的卵孢子囊。


Future Simple:
The study will investigate the role of oosporangia in disease transmission. = 这项研究将调查卵孢子囊在疾病传播中的作用。
