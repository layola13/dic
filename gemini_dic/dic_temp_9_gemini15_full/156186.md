词源:

The word "phraseology" is derived from the French word "phraséologie," which itself comes from the Greek words "phrasis" (phrase) and "logos" (study or discourse).  Therefore, it literally means "the study of phrases."


用法说明:

Phraseology is primarily a noun, referring to the style or manner of expression in speech or writing. It's often used to describe the distinctive vocabulary and sentence structure of a particular author, genre, or field.  It can be used positively (e.g., "elegant phraseology") or negatively (e.g., "clumsy phraseology").  It focuses on the *combination* of words rather than individual words themselves, differentiating it from simple vocabulary analysis.
