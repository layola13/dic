chemical-equation:/ˈkɛmɪkl iˈkweɪʒən/| n. |化学方程式|A symbolic representation of a chemical reaction, showing the reactants and products and their stoichiometric ratios.  It uses chemical formulas to represent the substances involved and shows the relative amounts of each substance. For example, 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O represents the reaction of two molecules of hydrogen with one molecule of oxygen to produce two molecules of water.|The chemical equation for the combustion of methane is CH₄ + 2O₂ → CO₂ + 2H₂O.|近义词：chemical formula (in a limited sense, when referring to a single reaction)|反义词：None|名词
