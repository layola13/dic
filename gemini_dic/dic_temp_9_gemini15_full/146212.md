词源:
The word "overexpend" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "beyond") and the verb "expend" (meaning "to spend or use up").  "Expend" itself comes from the Latin word "expendere," which is composed of "ex-" (out) and "pendere" (to weigh or hang).  Therefore, the etymological root suggests the idea of spending or using something completely, and "overexpend" adds the layer of exceeding that complete usage.
