Etymology:  The word "carunculated" derives from the Late Latin word *caruncula, meaning "a small piece of flesh," a diminutive of caro, "flesh."  The suffix "-ated" indicates the presence or condition of having the characteristic.  Therefore, "carunculated" describes something having the quality of being covered in small fleshy growths or projections, resembling the texture of a caruncle.
