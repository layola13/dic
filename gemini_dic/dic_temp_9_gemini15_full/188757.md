runtime:/ˈrʌntaɪm/| n. |运行时间；运行期；执行期 |The time it takes a program to run.  It encompasses the period from program initiation to termination.  This can include factors like processing time, input/output operations, and waiting time. |例句：The runtime of the program was unexpectedly long. = 程序的运行时间出乎意料的长。


The runtime environment significantly impacted the results. = 运行环境极大地影响了结果。|近义词：execution time, processing time |反义词：compile time, design time


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The program's runtime is short. = 程序的运行时间很短。
The runtime environment affects performance. = 运行环境影响性能。

一般过去时:
The runtime of the last simulation was too long. = 上次模拟的运行时间太长了。
The runtime error halted the process. = 运行时错误终止了进程。

现在完成时:
The developers have reduced the runtime significantly. = 开发人员已大幅缩短了运行时间。
The system has experienced several runtime failures. = 系统经历了几次运行时故障。

过去完成时:
The program had already exceeded its expected runtime. = 程序已经超过了预期的运行时间。
The server had experienced multiple runtime issues before the upgrade. = 服务器在升级之前已经经历了多次运行时问题。

将来时:
The new algorithm will decrease the runtime. = 新算法将减少运行时间。
The improved hardware will shorten the runtime of the application. = 升级的硬件将缩短应用程序的运行时间。

虚拟语气:
If the runtime were shorter, we could process more data. = 如果运行时间更短，我们可以处理更多数据。
I wish the runtime of this simulation were faster. = 我希望这个模拟的运行时间更快。

被动语态:
The runtime is heavily influenced by the system resources. = 运行时间受系统资源的影响很大。
The runtime was optimized for speed. = 运行时间针对速度进行了优化。

疑问句:
What is the runtime of this application? = 这个应用程序的运行时间是多少？
How can we improve the runtime performance? = 我们如何提高运行时间性能？

否定句:
The runtime was not as long as we anticipated. = 运行时间并不像我们预期的那样长。
The program did not encounter any runtime errors. = 程序没有遇到任何运行时错误。


PHRASE->
runtime environment = 运行环境
runtime error = 运行时错误
runtime library = 运行时库
runtime analysis = 运行时分析
runtime system = 运行时系统
