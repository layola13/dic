These scales are rhombic (diamond-shaped) and are covered with a layer of ganoin, a hard, enamel-like substance.  They are often found as fossils.  |  The placoganoidei were an important group of fishes during the Paleozoic Era. | 近义词:  (暂无合适的近义词，因为这是一个分类学上的术语，指代的是一个特定群体) | 反义词: (暂无)


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly paleontology and ichthyology.  Therefore, verb conjugations and other grammatical structures are less relevant than a deeper understanding of its usage in scientific literature and databases.  Examples of its use in sentences:

Example 1:
"Fossil finds from the Devonian period provide valuable insight into the diversity of the Placoganoidei." = 泥盆纪的化石发现为了解坚鳞鱼类的多样性提供了宝贵的见解。


Example 2:
"The phylogenetic relationships of Placoganoidei within the Actinopterygii remain a subject of ongoing research." = 坚鳞鱼类在辐鳍鱼纲中的系统发育关系仍然是正在进行的研究课题。


PHRASE->
Because "Placoganoidei" is a taxonomic order,  phrases are not typically constructed around the word itself. Instead, phrases would describe characteristics or relationships within the order, such as:

Phrase 1:  "Placoganoidei body morphology" = 坚鳞鱼类的体型形态
Phrase 2:  "Placoganoidei evolutionary history" = 坚鳞鱼类的进化史
Phrase 3:  "Placoganoidei fossil distribution" = 坚鳞鱼类的化石分布
Phrase 4:  "Phylogenetic analysis of Placoganoidei" = 坚鳞鱼类的系统发育分析
Phrase 5:  "Extinction of Placoganoidei" = 坚鳞鱼类的灭绝
