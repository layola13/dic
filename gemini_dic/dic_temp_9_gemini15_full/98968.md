词源：
The word "interlacing" is derived from the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and the verb "lace" (meaning "to fasten or tie together").  The original meaning refers to the weaving or braiding together of threads or strands. The extension to video technology reflects the similar alternating pattern of data.
