periodontosis:/ˌpɪəriˌɒdɒnˈtoʊsɪs/ | n. |牙周病(旧称，现多用牙周炎)|A now largely obsolete term for periodontitis, a severe gum disease that affects the supporting structures of the teeth.  It is characterized by progressive loss of alveolar bone and periodontal ligament.  The term is considered outdated because it often implied a non-inflammatory etiology, which is now known to be incorrect. |例句：The dentist diagnosed the patient with periodontosis, although the term is rarely used anymore.  这位牙医诊断病人患有牙周病，尽管这个术语现在很少使用了。|近义词：periodontitis, gum disease|反义词：healthy gums, healthy teeth|名词
