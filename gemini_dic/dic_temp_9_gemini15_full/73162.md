词源:

The word "forbearing" comes from the Old English verb "forberen," meaning "to forbear," which itself is a combination of the prefix "for-" (meaning "completely" or "away") and "beren," meaning "to bear" (to endure, tolerate, or carry).  The meaning evolved from simply enduring something to implying a conscious choice to restrain oneself.
