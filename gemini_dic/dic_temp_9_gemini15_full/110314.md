词源:
The word "lightbulb" is a compound word, combining "light" (meaning illumination) and "bulb" (referring to the glass enclosure).  "Bulb" itself comes from the Latin word *bulbus*, meaning "bulb" or "onion,"  referring to its rounded shape. The evolution of the word reflects the technology's development – starting with gas-filled glass bulbs and later incorporating the electric filament.
