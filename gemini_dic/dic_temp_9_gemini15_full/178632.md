词源:
The word "recovering" comes from the verb "recover," which originates from Old French "recovreir," meaning "to cover again."  This ultimately derives from the Latin "recuperare," composed of "re-" (again) and "capere" (to take). The "-ing" suffix indicates the present participle, signifying an ongoing action.
