词源:  The word "meaner" is the comparative form of the adjective "mean."  "Mean" in this context has its origins in Old English "gemǣne," meaning "common," "shared," or "general." Over time, this evolved to encompass negative connotations, especially "low" or "base," leading to its current usage referring to unkindness, stinginess, or cruelty.  The shift in meaning is a classic example of semantic change, where a word's meaning gradually alters over time.
