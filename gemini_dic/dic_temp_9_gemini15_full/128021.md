词源:

The word "nepotism" comes from the Italian word "nepote," meaning "nephew."  Historically, the term originated from the practice of Popes appointing their nephews to high positions within the Catholic Church.  The practice extended beyond the Church and became a general term for favoritism shown to relatives.
