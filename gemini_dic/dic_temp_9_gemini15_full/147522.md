The word "overpartially" is not a standard English word.  It does not appear in major dictionaries and is not used in common language or literature.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word), a misspelling, or a word created for a specific context.

If you encountered this word somewhere, please provide the context so that we can attempt to understand its intended meaning.  It might be a combination of "over" and "partially," suggesting an excessive degree of partialness or incompleteness, but without context, this is pure speculation.
