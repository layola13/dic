isentropic:/ˌaɪsɛnˈtrɒpɪk/| adj.|等熵的；绝热的|Relating to or denoting a thermodynamic process in which the entropy of the system remains constant.|例句：The isentropic expansion of a gas cools it.  气体的等熵膨胀会使其冷却。
例句：The process is assumed to be isentropic for simplification.  为简化起见，假设该过程是等熵的。|近义词：adiabatic (in some contexts)|反义词：non-isentropic

词源:
The word "isentropic" is formed from the prefix "iso-" (meaning "equal" or "same") and the word "entropic" (relating to entropy).  Entropy itself comes from Greek roots: "en" (in) and "trope" (turning or change). Thus, isentropic describes a process where the entropy remains constant or unchanged.

用法说明:

isentropic is primarily used in thermodynamics and fluid mechanics. It describes a process where there is no heat transfer and no generation of entropy.  While often approximated as adiabatic (no heat transfer),  it is a more precise term as it specifically addresses the constancy of entropy.  An isentropic process is an idealization, as real-world processes always involve some degree of entropy generation.

例句：

*  The isentropic efficiency of a turbine is a measure of how close its performance is to the ideal isentropic process. 涡轮的等熵效率衡量其性能与理想等熵过程的接近程度。

*  We can model the expansion of the gas as an isentropic process to simplify the calculations. 我们可以将气体的膨胀建模为等熵过程以简化计算。

*  The compression process was assumed to be isentropic in this theoretical analysis. 在这个理论分析中，假设压缩过程是等熵的。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "isentropic."  The word is primarily used in technical contexts.
