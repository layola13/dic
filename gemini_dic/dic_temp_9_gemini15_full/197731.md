词源:
The word "shiftlessness" is derived from the word "shift," meaning to change or move,  but in this context implies a lack of consistent effort or direction. The suffix "-lessness" denotes the absence of a quality, in this case, the absence of initiative and responsibility.  The word evolved gradually over time, reflecting a societal observation of a particular personality trait.
