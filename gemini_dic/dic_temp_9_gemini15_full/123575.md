词源:

From monstrous + -ness (suffix indicating a state, quality, or condition) + -es (plural suffix).  "Monstrous" itself derives from "monster," ultimately from Old French "monstre" and Latin "monstrum," meaning "omen, portent, prodigy."  The original sense implied something unnatural or abnormal, evolving to its modern meaning of something huge, frightening, or evil.
