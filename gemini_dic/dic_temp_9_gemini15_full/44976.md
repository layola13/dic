crystallinity: /ˌkrɪstəˈlɪnəti/ | n. |结晶度，晶体性 | The degree to which a solid material is crystalline.  It refers to the extent to which the constituent atoms or molecules are arranged in a highly ordered, repeating pattern characteristic of a crystal lattice.  High crystallinity implies a high degree of order, while low crystallinity indicates a more disordered, amorphous structure.  The level of crystallinity significantly impacts the material's physical and chemical properties, including its strength, hardness, melting point, and reactivity. | The high crystallinity of the diamond makes it exceptionally hard.  金刚石的高结晶度使其具有极高的硬度。  The polymer showed low crystallinity, resulting in poor mechanical strength.  该聚合物结晶度低，导致机械强度差。|amorphousness, order|amorphousness, disorder|


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The crystallinity of this material is high. = 这种材料的结晶度很高。
High crystallinity often leads to increased strength. = 高结晶度通常会导致强度增加。

一般过去时:
The sample showed higher crystallinity after annealing. = 退火后样品显示出更高的结晶度。
Researchers measured the crystallinity of the polymer. = 研究人员测量了聚合物的结晶度。

现在完成时:
Scientists have developed techniques to improve crystallinity. = 科学家们已经开发出提高结晶度的技术。
We have observed a significant increase in crystallinity. = 我们观察到结晶度显著提高。

过去完成时:
The material had already reached its maximum crystallinity before the test. = 在测试之前，材料已经达到了其最大结晶度。
They had not expected such high crystallinity in the sample. = 他们没有预料到样品中会有如此高的结晶度。

将来时:
We will determine the crystallinity using X-ray diffraction. = 我们将使用X射线衍射法测定结晶度。
The improved process will result in higher crystallinity. = 改进后的工艺将导致更高的结晶度。

虚拟语气:
If the crystallinity were higher, the material would be stronger. = 如果结晶度更高，材料就会更坚固。
I wish the crystallinity of this sample were better. = 我希望这个样品的结晶度更好。

被动语态:
The crystallinity was measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). = 结晶度是使用差示扫描量热法 (DSC) 测量的。
The crystallinity is affected by processing conditions. = 结晶度受加工条件的影响。

疑问句:
What is the crystallinity of the synthesized polymer? = 合成聚合物的结晶度是多少？
How can we improve the crystallinity of this material? = 我们如何提高这种材料的结晶度？

否定句:
This material does not exhibit high crystallinity. = 这种材料不表现出高结晶度。
The results did not indicate any significant changes in crystallinity. = 结果没有表明结晶度有任何显著变化。


PHRASE->
degree of crystallinity: 结晶度
crystallinity index: 结晶指数
crystallinity measurement: 结晶度测量
high crystallinity: 高结晶度
low crystallinity: 低结晶度

词源:
crystal (晶体) + -inity (表示性质、状态的后缀)  The word ultimately derives from the Greek word "krustallos," meaning "ice" or "rock crystal."
