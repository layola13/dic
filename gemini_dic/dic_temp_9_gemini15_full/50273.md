词源:
The word "dephlegmation" is derived from the word "phlegm," which comes from the Greek word "phlegma" (φλέγμα), meaning "inflammation," "burning," or "heat." In ancient medicine, "phlegm" was one of the four humors (along with blood, yellow bile, and black bile) believed to affect health.  The prefix "de-" indicates removal or separation.  Therefore, "dephlegmation" literally means "the removal of phlegm" or, in a broader chemical sense, the removal of impurities that resemble phlegm in their volatile nature.
