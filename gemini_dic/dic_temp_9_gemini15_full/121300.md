Etymology:

The word "misfitted" is a compound word formed from the prefix "mis-" and the past participle "fitted."

* **mis-**:  A prefix meaning "wrongly," "badly," "ill," or "not."  It indicates a negative or incorrect action or state.

* **fitted**: The past participle of the verb "to fit," meaning to be of the right size, shape, or proportions; to be suitable or appropriate.

Therefore, "misfitted" literally means "wrongly fitted" or "badly fitted," extending to the broader sense of being unsuitable or out of place.
