/ˌnɒnˌruːdɪmɛntˈɛərɪlɪnɪsɪz/ | n. |非基本性；非初步性；非发育完全性 | The word "nonrudimentarilynesses" is an extremely rare and unwieldy word, formed by combining several prefixes and suffixes to the root "rudimentary."  It describes the state of not being rudimentary, lacking basic or undeveloped qualities, or the absence of such states.  It emphasizes the multiplicity of such non-rudimentary qualities.  The word is largely considered inappropriate for common usage due to its length and complexity; simpler alternatives exist. | The sheer nonrudimentarilynesses of the proposed solution made it impractical. =  该方案缺乏基本要素的复杂性使其变得不切实际。


The nonrudimentarilynesses of his artistic approach contrasted sharply with the simplistic style of his peers. = 他艺术方法的非基本性与同龄人的简单风格形成了鲜明对比。
