词源:
The idiom "load the dice" originates from the literal act of weighting dice to make certain numbers more likely to appear. This physical act of cheating then metaphorically transferred to describe any situation where the odds are unfairly manipulated.  The term "dice" is the plural of "die," a small cube with numbered sides used in games of chance.  The act of "loading" means to add weight to make it fall a certain way.
