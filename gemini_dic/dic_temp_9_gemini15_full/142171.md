词源：
The word "ormer" is derived from the Old Norman French word "orme," which ultimately comes from a Celtic language, possibly Breton.  The specific Celtic origin is debated, but it likely relates to the sea creature itself.  The word reflects a historical connection to the Channel Islands, where ormers are abundant.
