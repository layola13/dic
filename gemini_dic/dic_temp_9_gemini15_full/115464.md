manufacturability:/ˌmænjuˌfæktʃərəˈbɪləti/| n. |可制造性，可生产性 |The ease with which a product can be manufactured.  It considers factors such as design, materials, processes, and cost.|The high manufacturability of the design reduced production costs significantly.  这个设计的可制造性高，大大降低了生产成本。|近义词：producibility, feasibility|反义词：unmanufacturability


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The manufacturability of this product is high. = 这个产品的可制造性很高。
