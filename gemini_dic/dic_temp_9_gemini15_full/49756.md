词源:
The word "demolish" comes from the Old French word "demolir," which is composed of "de-" (meaning "completely" or "away") and "molir" (meaning "to grind" or "to crumble").  Therefore, the original meaning implied a complete grinding or crumbling to pieces.  The meaning has evolved to primarily encompass the destruction of buildings and structures, but also includes the figurative sense of completely defeating or destroying something abstract, like an argument or hope.
