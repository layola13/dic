clinorhombic: /ˌklaɪnəˈrɒmbɪk/ | adj. | 斜方晶系的 | Relating to or denoting a crystal system characterized by three unequal axes, two of which are at right angles to each other and the third at oblique angles to both.  This system lacks a center of symmetry and four axes of symmetry.  | Example:  The mineral displayed a distinct clinorhombic structure under the microscope.  显微镜下，这种矿物呈现出明显的斜方晶系结构。 The crystal's clinorhombic habit made it easily distinguishable.  该晶体的斜方晶系习性使其易于区分。 | 近义词: monoclinic (although technically distinct, often used interchangeably in less formal contexts) | 反义词:  isometric, tetragonal, orthorhombic (referring to other crystal systems) |
