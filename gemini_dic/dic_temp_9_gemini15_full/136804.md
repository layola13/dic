nonsharings:/ˈnɒnˈʃeərɪŋz/ | n. | 非共享 | The term "nonsharings" is not a standard English word found in dictionaries.  It appears to be a newly coined term, likely formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") and "sharings" (the plural of "sharing").  Its meaning would depend on the context in which it's used, generally implying things, resources, or characteristics that are *not* shared.  For example, in a discussion of computer networks, it might refer to data or resources not accessible to all users.  | 例句：The study highlighted the impact of nonsharings on team collaboration. (这项研究强调了非共享对团队合作的影响。)   The document outlines the various nonsharings between the two departments.
