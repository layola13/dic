词源:
The word "self-objectification" is a modern term coined by combining "self" (referring to oneself) and "objectification" (the action of treating someone as an object).  "Objectification" itself derives from "object" (a thing) and the suffix "-ification" (the process of making or becoming something).  The term's rise in usage is linked to feminist scholarship and discussions around body image and societal pressures on appearance.
