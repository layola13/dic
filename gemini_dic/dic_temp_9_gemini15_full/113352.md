词源:
The word "luxury" ultimately derives from the Latin word "luxuria," meaning "luxuriance," "abundance," or "excess."  This root carries connotations of lushness and overabundance, which evolved into the modern sense of expensive and indulgent pleasure.  The word passed through Old French ("luxurie") before entering English.
