反义词: failure, defeat, insignificance (for the "achievement" sense)


词源:  From Italian *impresa*, literally "enterprise," from *imprendere* "to undertake," from *in-* "in" + *prendere* "to take."  The word's evolution reflects its shift from a specifically heraldic context to a broader meaning encompassing any significant undertaking.
