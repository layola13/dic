selfing:/ˈsɛlfɪŋ/| n. |自交，自花授粉|The process of self-fertilization, especially in plants.  It refers to the reproduction of an organism from its own gametes, without the involvement of another individual.  This can occur in plants through self-pollination, or in animals through self-fertilization.  Selfing can lead to increased homozygosity and reduced genetic diversity. |Example:  Selfing is common in many plant species. = 自花授粉在许多植物物种中很常见。


The continuous selfing of a plant population can lead to inbreeding depression. = 植物种群的持续自交会导致近交衰退。


近义词：self-fertilization, autogamy |反义词：outcrossing, cross-pollination
