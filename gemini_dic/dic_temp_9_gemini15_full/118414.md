The word "merriness" comes from the Middle English word "merrinesse," which itself derives from the Old English word "myrþ," meaning "mirth," "joy," or "pleasure."  The "-ness" suffix is a common English suffix that forms abstract nouns from adjectives or verbs, indicating a state, quality, or condition.  Therefore, "merriness" signifies the state or quality of being merry.
