词源:
The word "light bulb" is a compound word. "Light" refers to the illumination produced by the device, and "bulb" refers to the glass enclosure containing the light-producing element.  The term emerged with the invention and popularization of electric lighting in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  The "bulb" part derives from the Latin word "bulbus," meaning "bulb" or "round swelling," referring to the shape of the glass enclosure.
