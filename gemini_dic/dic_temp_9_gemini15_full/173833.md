词源:

The word "quasi-privately" is a compound word.

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," "almost," or "seemingly."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation to something.

* **privately**: From "private," derived from Old French *privé*, ultimately from Latin *privatus*, the past participle of *privare*, meaning "to deprive."  In this context, "private" refers to something kept secret or away from public knowledge.


Therefore, "quasi-privately" means "almost privately," or "in a manner resembling privacy."
