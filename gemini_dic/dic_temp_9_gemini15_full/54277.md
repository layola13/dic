词源：

* **disguise:**  This comes from the Old French word *desguiser*, which itself is a combination of *des-* (meaning "to undo" or "to remove") and *guise* (meaning "appearance," "manner," or "fashion").  The evolution reflects the idea of removing one's true appearance.

* **-edly:** This suffix is added to adjectives to form adverbs, indicating the manner in which something is done.
