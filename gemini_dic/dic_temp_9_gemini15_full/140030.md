oenanthylate:/oʊˈænθɪleɪt/ | n. |庚酸酯|An oenanthylate is an ester derived from oenanthic acid (heptanoic acid).  It's characterized by the presence of a heptyl group (-C₇H₁₅) linked to a carboxyl group (-COO) through an ester linkage.  These compounds are often found in natural products and can have various applications depending on their specific structure.  | Example: Ethyl oenanthylate is a component of some fruit and wine aromas. 乙基庚酸酯是某些水果和葡萄酒香气中的成分。 |近义词:  (depending on the specific oenanthylate)  heptyl ester|反义词: N/A |名词
