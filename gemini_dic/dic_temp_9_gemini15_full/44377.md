词源:
The word "cross-curricular" is a compound word. "Cross" means "across" or "involving different aspects". "Curricular" is derived from "curriculum," which comes from the Latin word "curriculum," meaning "a running course" or "race track."  Over time, it came to refer to the course of study in an educational institution.  Therefore, "cross-curricular" literally means "across the course of study" or "involving multiple subjects within the course of study".
