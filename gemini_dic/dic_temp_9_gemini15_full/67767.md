词源:

The word "eyeglasses" is a compound word.  "Eye" refers to the organ of sight, and "glasses" is a plural noun derived from the Old English "glas," meaning "glass." The word evolved over time, with "spectacles" being an earlier term, and "eyeglasses" becoming more common in the 17th century.  The use of lenses to correct vision dates back to ancient times, but the modern form of eyeglasses became prevalent in the Middle Ages and Renaissance.
