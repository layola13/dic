noninterceptive: /ˌnɒnɪnˈtɜːsɛptɪv/ | adj. |非拦截的，不拦截的 | Not intercepting; not involving interception.  This word is a relatively rare and specialized term, primarily used in technical contexts, particularly related to communication systems and radar. It describes something that does not interrupt or block a signal or object. | Example: "The noninterceptive radar system allowed for continuous monitoring without disrupting the target's activity." | Near synonyms: non-blocking, unimpeded | Antonyms: interceptive, blocking, interrupting |


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The radar uses a noninterceptive scanning method. = 雷达使用非拦截扫描方法。
This system provides noninterceptive data collection. = 此系统提供非拦截数据收集。


一般过去时:
The experiment employed a noninterceptive observation technique. = 实验采用了非拦截观察技术。
The researchers used a noninterceptive data recording method. = 研究人员使用了非拦截数据记录方法。


现在完成时:
The team has developed a noninterceptive communication protocol. = 该团队已经开发了一种非拦截通信协议。
They have successfully tested the noninterceptive surveillance system. = 他们已经成功测试了非拦截监控系统。


过去完成时:
Before the upgrade, the system had been interceptive. = 在升级之前，系统一直是拦截式的。
The scientists had previously relied on interceptive methods. = 科学家们之前一直依赖于拦截式方法。


将来时:
Future developments will focus on noninterceptive technologies. = 未来的发展将集中在非拦截技术上。
The company will implement a noninterceptive network security system. = 公司将实施一个非拦截网络安全系统。


虚拟语气:
If we used a noninterceptive approach, the results would be more accurate. = 如果我们采用非拦截方法，结果会更准确。
It would be beneficial if we could find a truly noninterceptive method of data collection. = 如果我们能找到一种真正非拦截的数据收集方法，那将是有益的。


被动语态:
A noninterceptive monitoring system is being developed. = 正在开发一种非拦截监控系统。
Noninterceptive techniques are being increasingly adopted in various fields. = 非拦截技术正越来越多地应用于各个领域。


疑问句:
Is this a noninterceptive communication system? = 这是一个非拦截通信系统吗？
Are there any known limitations to this noninterceptive method? = 这种非拦截方法有什么已知的局限性吗？


否定句:
The old system was not noninterceptive; it frequently interrupted signals. = 旧系统并非非拦截的；它经常中断信号。
Their approach was not entirely noninterceptive; some signal interference occurred. = 他们的方法并非完全非拦截的；发生了一些信号干扰。


PHRASE->
noninterceptive monitoring = 非拦截监控
noninterceptive surveillance = 非拦截监控
noninterceptive communication = 非拦截通信
noninterceptive radar = 非拦截雷达
noninterceptive data acquisition = 非拦截数据采集
