词源:  The word "sassy" itself originated in the early 20th century, possibly from a combination of "sauce" (meaning impudence or impertinence) and a diminutive suffix. Its evolution reflects a shift in connotation from primarily negative (impudent) to also include positive aspects (stylish, spirited). The superlative form "sassiest" simply adds the superlative suffix "-est" to intensify the meaning.
