USAGE->

This word is a relatively uncommon noun.  It doesn't lend itself to the same range of grammatical constructions as common verbs or nouns.  Therefore, providing examples across all tenses and voice is impractical and unnatural.  Instead, I'll focus on showing its usage in different sentence structures.


Simple Sentence:  The justnesses of the decision were questioned.  （这个决定的公正性受到了质疑。）

Complex Sentence: Although the law aimed for justnesses, its application often fell short.  （虽然法律旨在追求公正，但其应用往往达不到。）

Compound Sentence: The court considered the justnesses of the case, and ultimately ruled in favor of the plaintiff. （法院审理了案件的公正性，最终判决原告胜诉。）


PHRASE->

There aren't common set phrases using "justnesses."  The word itself is used to describe a concept rather than participate in idiomatic expressions.  It's more likely to be found in formal writing discussing legal or ethical matters.
