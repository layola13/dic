gamma-globulins: /ˈɡæmə ˈɡlɒbjʊlɪnz/ | n. | γ-球蛋白 | A group of proteins found in blood serum that play a vital role in the immune system, providing immunity against various infections.  They are a part of the immunoglobulin family and are crucial for antibody-mediated immunity. | Example:  The doctor ordered a blood test to check the levels of gamma-globulins. 医生开了个验血单来检查γ-球蛋白的水平。

| Example: Low levels of gamma-globulins can increase susceptibility to infections. 低水平的γ-球蛋白会增加感染的易感性。 | 近义词: immunoglobulins, antibodies | 反义词: (no direct antonym, but a deficiency could be considered an antonym in a functional sense) | 名词

词源:
The term "gamma-globulin" is derived from "gamma" (referring to a fraction of serum proteins separated by electrophoresis) and "globulin" (a class of globular proteins).  The "gamma" designation is based on historical electrophoretic separation methods.
