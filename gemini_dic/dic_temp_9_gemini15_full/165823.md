preobviousness:/ˌpriːˈɒbviəsnəs/| n. |显而易见性，预先显而易见|The preobviousness of the invention was a key factor in the patent rejection.  发明在申请专利时就已经很明显了，这是专利被驳回的关键因素。|近义词：obviousness, foreseeability |反义词：unobviousness, unforeseeability


The word "preobviousness" is not a standard or commonly used word in the English language.  It's a neologism, likely coined to describe something that is obvious even *before* it's officially presented or discovered.  It combines the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") with "obviousness" (the state of being obvious).

There is no established dictionary definition.  Its meaning is derived from its constituent parts.  The context in which it is used is critical to understanding its intended meaning.  It is primarily used in legal and technical contexts, particularly in patent law discussions concerning whether an invention was obvious before its claimed date of invention.  It suggests an anticipation of the invention's obviousness.
