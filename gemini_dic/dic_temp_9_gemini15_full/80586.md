词源:
The word "goofy" likely originated as a slang term in the early 20th century, potentially related to the word "gopher," which refers to a type of burrowing rodent. The association might stem from the gopher's seemingly clumsy and unpredictable movements.  Another potential link is to the word "goof," meaning a mistake or blunder, suggesting a connection to someone acting clumsily or making silly mistakes. The exact etymology remains uncertain, but its playful and informal nature is evident in its usage.
