词源:

The word "rewindable" is formed by combining the verb "rewind" with the suffix "-able."  "Rewind" itself is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") and the verb "wind," which originally referred to the act of turning or twisting something, often a coil of rope or thread.  The "-able" suffix transforms the verb into an adjective, indicating capability or possibility.  The ultimate roots trace back to Proto-Germanic and Proto-Indo-European roots related to twisting and turning.
