jewries:/ˈdʒuːəriːz/| n.|犹太人居住区；犹太区 | A Jewry is a historical term referring to a quarter or section of a town or city in which Jewish people lived, often under specific legal restrictions.  These areas were sometimes established by law and often characterized by a high density of Jewish residents and specific communal institutions.  The term can carry negative connotations due to its association with historical discrimination and segregation. | Example:  In medieval Europe, many cities had designated jewries.  在中世纪的欧洲，许多城市都有指定的犹太人居住区。 |近义词：ghetto (often used interchangeably but with potentially stronger negative connotations) |反义词：None specifically, as it describes a place rather than a concept with direct opposites.
