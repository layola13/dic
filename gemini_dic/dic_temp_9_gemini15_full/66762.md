exospore:/ˈɛksoʊspɔːr/| n. |外生孢子|An exospore is a spore formed on the outside of a cell or structure, as opposed to an endospore which is formed within a cell.  Exospores are commonly found in certain fungi and algae. |Example: The fungus produced numerous exospores, which were then dispersed by the wind.|近义词：external spore|反义词：endospore
