词源:
The word "cheeky" ultimately derives from "cheek," meaning the fleshy side of the face.  Its development into an adjective describing impudence likely evolved from the association of a bold or impudent expression with the cheeks, perhaps a slight blush or a defiant set of the mouth.  The use of "cheek" to mean impudence is recorded from the early 17th century, with "cheeky" following shortly thereafter.
