词源:
The word "overinfluenced" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the past participle "influenced" (from the verb "influence").  The root of "influence" traces back to Old French *influencier, ultimately deriving from Latin *influentia ("influence, power").
