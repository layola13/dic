词源:
The word "overgird" is a relatively rare word, formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much") with the verb "gird," which originally meant "to encircle" or "to surround."  The sense of "to restrain" is a less common, but related, meaning of "gird."  Therefore, "overgird" combines the excessive nature of the prefix with the encircling or restraining action of the root word.  Its usage reflects a modern application of the older, less common meanings of "gird".
