The word "predefraying" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word with limited usage.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need to consider possible intended words:


**Possible Interpretations and Analysis:**

If "predefraying" was intended to be a combination of "pre-" and a word related to "defray," we could analyze potential words like "prepaying" or "pre-defraying" (as a hyphenated word suggesting an action before defraying).


1. **Prepaying:** /ˌpriːˈpeɪɪŋ/ | v. | 预付，预先支付 | Paying in advance. | Example:  Prepaying your rent ensures you avoid late fees. = 预付房租可以避免滞纳金。

    *  Near Synonyms:  Paying upfront, advancing payment.
    *  Antonyms:  Postpaying, delaying payment.


2. **Pre-defraying (hypothetical):**  Assuming "defray" meaning to meet the cost of something, "pre-defraying" could mean making preparations or arrangements to cover costs before they arise. This isn't a standard word, but its meaning can be inferred from context.

    *  /ˌpriːˌdɪˈfreɪɪŋ/ | v. | 预先支付, 预先负担 (非标准词汇) | Making arrangements to cover costs before they occur. | Example:  The company engaged in pre-defraying expenses for the upcoming conference. = 公司正在为即将举行的会议预先支付费用。  (Note: This sentence uses the hypothetical word in a context that makes its meaning clear)
    *  Near Synonyms:  Budgeting, planning expenses, pre-allocating funds.
    *  Antonyms:  Postponing payment, neglecting expenses.



**Regarding the requested grammatical tense examples:**  Since "predefraying" is not a standard word, providing examples for various tenses would be artificial and misleading.  The tenses would follow standard verb conjugation rules if a similar standard word were used (e.g., prepaying).  The example sentences provided above for prepaying and the hypothetical pre-defraying demonstrate how these tenses would work.


**PHRASE:**  Because "predefraying" is not a standard word, there are no common phrases associated with it.


In conclusion, without more context or clarification about the intended meaning of "predefraying," a complete analysis following your format is impossible. The possible interpretations and examples above provide a reasonable approach based on likely intended meanings.
