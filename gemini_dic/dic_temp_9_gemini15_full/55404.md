The word "dister" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:** Perhaps you meant a different word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word or a term used within a specific community or context.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered the word), it might be possible to understand its meaning.
* **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or place name.


If you can provide more information, I'll be happy to help.
