词源:  The word "neighbourer" is derived from the Old English "neahgebur," which is a compound of "neah" (near) and "gebur" (dweller, inhabitant, farmer). Over time, the word evolved through Middle English "neighebour" to its modern form.  The "-er" suffix adds emphasis and can sometimes imply a more frequent or habitual interaction, as compared to simply a "neighbor".
