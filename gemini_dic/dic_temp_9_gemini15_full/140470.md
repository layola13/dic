词源:

The word is a combination of "old maid" and the suffix "-ism," which denotes a doctrine, belief, or characteristic.  "Old maid" itself has a long history, referring to a woman who remains unmarried past a socially acceptable age (a definition heavily influenced by societal norms of past eras). The "-ism" suffix transforms it into a noun describing the perceived characteristics associated with such a woman.  The term carries a significant amount of historical baggage, reflecting outdated societal views on women and marriage.
