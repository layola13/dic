词源:

The word "non-employment" is a compound word.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "absence of," derived from the Latin word "non," meaning "not."  "Employment" comes from the Old French word "emploi," meaning "employment, use, occupation," ultimately from the Latin "im-" (in) + "pleo" (to fill).  Therefore, "non-employment" literally means "not having employment."
