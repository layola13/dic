词源:

The word "distemper" comes from the Old French word "destemprer," meaning "to be out of order" or "to spoil,"  ultimately deriving from the Latin "dis-" (meaning "apart," "away," "not") and "temperare" (meaning "to temper," "to moderate," "to mix").  The original sense referred to a disturbance in the bodily humors, then extended to a spoiled condition of anything, and finally to a specific canine disease.
