词源:
The word "overprominence" is a combination of "over-" (meaning "excessive" or "too much") and "prominence" (meaning "the state of being important, noticeable, or famous").  "Prominence" itself comes from the Latin word "prominere," meaning "to jut out," "to project," or "to stand out."

用法说明:
Overprominence refers to something that is emphasized or highlighted to an excessive degree, often to the detriment of other aspects or elements.  It suggests an imbalance or disproportionate attention given to a particular feature or characteristic.  The overemphasized element can be distracting, overwhelming, or simply inappropriate given the context.

例句:

The overprominence of the political agenda overshadowed the social issues.  政治议程的过分突出掩盖了社会问题。

The overprominence of the bass guitar in the mix ruined the song's balance. 混音中贝斯吉他过分突出破坏了歌曲的平衡。
