cotransfers:/ˌkoʊˈtrænsfɜːrz/ | n. | 共同转移；协同转移 | The term "cotransfers" refers to the simultaneous transfer of multiple genetic elements or molecules during a process like bacterial conjugation or transduction.  It often implies a linked transfer, where the elements are physically close together on the genome and thus more likely to be transferred together.  The study of cotransfers helps researchers understand gene organization and genetic linkage. | Example:  Studies of cotransfers of antibiotic resistance genes in bacteria are crucial for understanding the spread of antimicrobial resistance.  =  细菌中抗生素抗性基因共同转移的研究对于理解抗菌素耐药性的传播至关重要。 |近义词：co-transmission, linked transfer | 反义词：independent transfer |
