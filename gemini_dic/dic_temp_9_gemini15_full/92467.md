hypostoma:/haɪˈpɒstəmə/| n. |下口, 基底, 底部|The hypostoma is the ventral (bottom) surface of the mouthparts of certain invertebrates, particularly arachnids and some crustaceans.  It often bears structures important for feeding or sensory perception.  For example, in ticks, the hypostoma is equipped with barbs that help it anchor itself to the host's skin during feeding. |The tick's hypostoma, armed with backward-pointing barbs, firmly attached itself to the dog's skin. = 蜱虫的下口，长着向后指的倒刺，牢牢地附着在狗的皮肤上。 The hypostoma of the spider was examined under the microscope. = 蜘蛛的下口在显微镜下被检查。|近义词：base, bottom, underside|反义词：epistome (in some contexts)|名词
