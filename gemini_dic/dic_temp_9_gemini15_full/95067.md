词源:

The word "inadmissibly" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the adjective "admissible" (meaning "acceptable" or "allowable" in a legal or formal context), and the suffix "-ly" (forming an adverb).  "Admissible" itself originates from the verb "admit," meaning "to allow entry or acceptance."  Therefore, "inadmissibly" literally means "not acceptably" or "not allowably."
