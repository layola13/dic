词源:
The word "rubberneck" is a compound word.  The "rubber" part likely refers to the flexible and stretchy nature of a neck when craning it to look at something, similar to the elasticity of rubber. "Neck" maintains its standard meaning.  The exact origin is uncertain, but it emerged in American English in the early 20th century.
