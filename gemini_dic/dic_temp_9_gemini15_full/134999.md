The word "nonnebulousness" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "nebulousness" (meaning "the state of being unclear, vague, or indistinct").  "Nebulous" itself originates from the Latin word "nebula," meaning "mist" or "cloud."  Therefore, "nonnebulousness" literally means "not being misty or cloudy," hence, clear and precise.
