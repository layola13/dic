The word "reckling" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it in major resources like Merriam-Webster, Oxford English Dictionary, or Cambridge Dictionary.  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a newly coined word, a dialect word, or a word from a specific context (like a fictional work).  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer a more helpful response.
