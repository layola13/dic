词源:  The word "passenger" comes from the Old French word *passagiere*, which means "passenger" or "traveller."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word *passagium*, meaning "passage" or "journey."  The modern English word reflects the historical understanding of a passenger as someone who pays for passage on a journey.
