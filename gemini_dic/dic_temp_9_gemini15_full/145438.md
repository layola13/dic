This word is not a standard English word.  It's a nonce word, meaning it's created for a specific occasion and not found in standard dictionaries. It's formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or too much) to the noun "cheapnesses," which itself is a less common form of "cheapness" (the state of being cheap).  Therefore, the word attempts to convey the idea of something being excessively cheap, possibly to a fault.

There is no established etymology beyond the straightforward combination of "over" and "cheapness."  "Cheap" has Old English roots, ultimately deriving from the Proto-Germanic *kaupōn ("to buy, bargain").  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix forming abstract nouns indicating a state or quality.


Because it's a nonce word, there are no standard grammatical usages beyond its basic function as a noun.  The grammatical examples requested in the prompt format are therefore inapplicable.  One could theoretically use it in various grammatical constructions, but such usage would be unconventional and potentially confusing.
