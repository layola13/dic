The word "moeve" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "move," "moot," or another word entirely?

2. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (name of a person, place, or thing) not widely known.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word or slang term not yet in common usage.

4. **It's from a different language:** It might be a word from another language. If you can provide the context where you encountered this word, I might be able to help you further.
