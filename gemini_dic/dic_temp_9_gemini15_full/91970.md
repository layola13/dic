hypermutableness:/ˌhaɪpərmjuːtəˈbɪlnəs/| n. |超变异性，高度突变性 |The ability of a genome or a specific region of a genome to undergo an unusually high rate of mutation. This can be caused by various factors, including the presence of mutational hotspots, errors in DNA replication, or the action of mutagenic agents.  Hypermutability is often observed in regions of the genome involved in immune responses or in certain types of cancer. | Example: The hypermutableness of the immunoglobulin genes allows for the generation of a vast repertoire of antibodies.  超免疫球蛋白基因的高度突变性使得能够产生大量的抗体库。| 近义词：high mutability, excessive mutation | 反义词：mutation stability, genomic stability | 名词
