Etymology:

The word "pseudomonastical" is derived from the genus name *Pseudomonas* combined with the adjectival suffix "-ical".  *Pseudomonas* itself is a New Latin word, combining the Greek words *pseudo-* (ψευδο-, meaning "false") and *monas* (μονας, meaning "unit" or "single").  Therefore, the name literally translates to "false unit," reflecting the historical misclassification of these bacteria before their true nature was understood.  The suffix "-ical" signifies "relating to" or "characteristic of."
