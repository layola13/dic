USAGE->
This word is an adverb, and therefore doesn't have the same verb conjugations as a verb.  It describes how something happens, not the action itself.  Therefore, tense, voice, and mood don't apply directly to the word "correlatively".  The tense, voice, and mood are determined by the verb in the sentence where "correlatively" is used.
