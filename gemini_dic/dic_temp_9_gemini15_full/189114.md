saccharomycetes:/ˌsækəroʊmaɪˈsiːtiːz/| n. |酵母菌属|Saccharomycetes is a class of fungi that includes yeasts. They are unicellular, eukaryotic organisms that reproduce asexually by budding.  They are important in various industries, including baking, brewing, and winemaking, due to their ability to ferment sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide.  Many species are also used in biotechnology for the production of various compounds.|Example:  The baker used a specific strain of *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* to leaven the bread.  面包师使用了一种特定的酿酒酵母菌株来使面包发酵。|近义词：yeasts (but broader)|反义词：None specifically, but could be contrasted with other fungal classes.
