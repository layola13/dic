fibrochondrosteal: /ˌfaɪbroʊkɒnˈdroʊstiəl/ | adj. | 纤维软骨骨的 | Relating to or composed of fibrous tissue, cartilage, and bone.  This term describes a tissue or structure that contains components of all three: fibrous connective tissue, cartilage, and bone.  It's often used in medical contexts to describe certain types of tumors or developmental abnormalities.


例句：

The biopsy revealed a fibrochondrosteal lesion in the patient's knee. = 活检显示患者膝盖有一个纤维软骨骨病变。

The tumor exhibited fibrochondrosteal differentiation. = 肿瘤表现出纤维软骨骨分化。


近义词：fibrocartilaginous (if emphasizing the fibrous and cartilaginous components more), osteocartilaginous (if emphasizing bone and cartilage)


反义词：There isn't a direct antonym, as it describes a combination of tissues.  One could use terms describing the absence of one of the components, such as "non-cartilaginous" or "non-osseous," but these are not true antonyms.


词性：形容词
