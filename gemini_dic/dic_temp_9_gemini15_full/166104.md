词源:  The word "prepossession" comes from the Old French word "prepossession," which itself is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the word "possession" (meaning "control" or "occupation").  The original sense was closer to "prior occupation" or "preoccupation," but it evolved to include the current meaning of a preconceived opinion.
