The word "nonbusier" does not exist in standard English.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  There's no entry for it in major dictionaries.  To analyze it, we need to break down its potential components:

* **non-:** This is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of."

* **busier:** This is the comparative form of the adjective "busy," meaning "occupied or engrossed."


Therefore, "nonbusier" would logically mean "not busier" or "less busy."  However, the correct way to express this in English is **"less busy"** or, in some contexts, **"not as busy."**
