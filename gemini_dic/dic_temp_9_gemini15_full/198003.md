shockability: /ˌʃɒkəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可电击性，对电击的反应能力 | The ability of the heart to respond to defibrillation.  This term refers to the heart's capacity to resume a normal rhythm after receiving an electric shock, typically from a defibrillator.  A patient's shockability is a crucial factor in determining the success of defibrillation. | Example: The patient's poor shockability made resuscitation extremely difficult.  病人对电击反应差，使得复苏极其困难。  The paramedics assessed the patient's shockability before administering defibrillation. 急救人员在进行电击除颤前评估了病人的可电击性。 | 近义词：responsiveness to defibrillation, defibrillability | 反义词：unresponsiveness to defibrillation, undefibrillability


USAGE->

一般现在时:
His heart shows good shockability. = 他的心脏显示出良好的可电击性。

一般过去时:
The patient's shockability was poor after the cardiac arrest. = 心脏骤停后，病人的可电击性很差。
The paramedics determined that the shockability was low. = 急救人员确定可电击性较低。

现在完成时:
The patient has shown improved shockability since the medication. = 自从服药以来，病人的可电击性有所改善。
We have observed a decline in shockability over the past hour. = 在过去的一个小时里，我们观察到可电击性下降。

过去完成时:
The doctor had already assessed the patient's poor shockability before attempting defibrillation.  = 在尝试电击除颤之前，医生已经评估了病人较差的可电击性。
They had found that the shockability was compromised due to the prolonged cardiac arrest.  = 他们发现由于长时间的心脏骤停，可电击性受到了损害。

将来时:
We will monitor the patient's shockability closely. = 我们将密切监测病人的可电击性。
The doctor expects the shockability to improve with treatment. = 医生预计治疗后可电击性会改善。


虚拟语气:
If the patient's shockability were better, the chances of survival would be higher. = 如果病人的可电击性更好，存活的几率就会更高。
It would be beneficial if we could improve the patient's shockability before defibrillation. = 如果我们能在电击除颤前提高病人的可电击性，将会有益。

被动语态:
The patient's shockability was tested before the procedure. = 病人在手术前进行了可电击性测试。
The shockability is being monitored continuously. = 可电击性正在持续监测中。

疑问句:
What is the patient's shockability? = 病人的可电击性如何？
Is the patient's shockability good enough for defibrillation? = 病人的可电击性足以进行电击除颤吗？

否定句:
The patient does not have good shockability. = 病人没有良好的可电击性。
The tests showed that shockability was absent. = 测试显示没有可电击性。
