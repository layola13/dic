prominority: /ˌprɒmɪˈnɒrɪti/ | n. | 少数中的佼佼者，杰出少数派 | A group or individual within a minority that stands out due to their exceptional achievements, influence, or visibility.  This term highlights a paradox: being both a minority and prominent within that minority. It suggests a unique position of influence despite the overall smaller representation.  | Example:  The prominority of female CEOs in the tech industry are making significant strides in breaking the glass ceiling.  少数科技行业中担任CEO的女性，正在打破玻璃天花板方面取得显著进展。|近义词:  leading minority, standout minority, exceptional minority | 反义词:  insignificant minority, unrepresented minority
