extrusions:/ɪkˈstruːʒənz/ | n. |挤压成型；挤出物 |The process of shaping a material by forcing it through a die,  resulting in a continuous length of a specific profile.  Extrusion is used to create various products with consistent cross-sections. |例句：The aluminum extrusions were used to build the frame. 铝挤压件被用来建造框架。

The plastic extrusions formed the window frames.  塑料挤压件构成了窗框。|近义词：moldings, profiles |反义词： None specifically, but the opposite would be methods of shaping material that don't involve forcing it through a die, such as casting or forging.

词源:

The word "extrusion" comes from the verb "extrude," which is formed from the Latin prefix "ex-" (out) and the verb "trudere" (to push, thrust).  Therefore, "extrusion" literally means "a pushing out."
