词源:
Patronizing ultimately derives from the verb "patronize," which comes from the Old French word "patroniser," meaning "to act as a patron to."  A patron was originally a person who gave support or protection, often financially, to someone else, especially an artist or writer.  The modern sense of "patronizing" reflects a shift in meaning, where the implied superiority of the patron becomes the dominant aspect.
