nucellus:/njuːˈsɛləs/| n. |胚珠中心柱|The nucellus is the central part of an ovule, containing the megasporangium, which develops into the female gametophyte (embryo sac).  It is surrounded by one or more integuments.  In many angiosperms, the nucellus is largely or completely consumed during the development of the embryo sac. |The nucellus of this ovule is particularly large.|近义词:megasporangium |反义词:integument


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The nucellus nourishes the developing embryo. = 胚珠中心柱滋养发育中的胚胎。
The nucellus provides nutrients to the embryo sac. = 胚珠中心柱为胚囊提供营养。


一般过去时:
The nucellus was completely absorbed by the embryo sac. = 胚珠中心柱被胚囊完全吸收。
The researchers examined the nucellus under a microscope. = 研究人员在显微镜下检查了胚珠中心柱。


现在完成时:
The nucellus has been largely consumed in this species. = 在这个物种中，胚珠中心柱已被大量消耗。
Scientists have studied the development of the nucellus extensively. = 科学家们已经广泛研究了胚珠中心柱的发育。


过去完成时:
The nucellus had already been reduced before fertilization occurred. = 受精发生之前，胚珠中心柱已经被减少了。
The researchers had observed the nucellus's structure before sectioning it. = 研究人员在切片之前已经观察了胚珠中心柱的结构。


将来时:
The nucellus will provide nourishment to the developing embryo. = 胚珠中心柱将为发育中的胚胎提供营养。
Scientists will continue to study the function of the nucellus. = 科学家们将继续研究胚珠中心柱的功能。


虚拟语气:
If the nucellus were larger, the embryo would develop better. = 如果胚珠中心柱更大，胚胎就会发育得更好。
I wish the nucellus were more easily observable. = 我希望胚珠中心柱更容易观察。


被动语态:
The nucellus was examined using various techniques. = 胚珠中心柱是用各种技术进行检查的。
The development of the nucellus is influenced by environmental factors. = 胚珠中心柱的发育受环境因素的影响。


疑问句:
What is the function of the nucellus in this plant? = 在这种植物中，胚珠中心柱的功能是什么？
How does the nucellus contribute to seed development? = 胚珠中心柱如何促进种子发育？


否定句:
The nucellus did not fully develop in this particular sample. = 在这个特定样本中，胚珠中心柱没有完全发育。
The researchers did not find any evidence of nucellar cells in this tissue. = 研究人员在这个组织中没有发现任何胚珠中心柱细胞的证据。


PHRASE->
nucellar cells = 胚珠中心柱细胞
nucellar epidermis = 胚珠中心柱表皮
nucellar projection = 胚珠中心柱突起
development of the nucellus = 胚珠中心柱发育
structure of the nucellus = 胚珠中心柱结构
