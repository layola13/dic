词源:
The word "grubbies" is a colloquial term, likely derived from the word "grub," meaning food, especially simple or coarse food.  The association might be with the idea of clothes being as rough and unkempt as "grub."  There's no definitive etymological record pinpointing its precise origin, as it evolved through informal usage.
