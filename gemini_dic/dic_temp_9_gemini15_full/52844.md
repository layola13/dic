近义词：

Multidimensionality:  This term is very close in meaning and often interchangeable with dimensionalities.

Facets: This refers to the different aspects or sides of something, similar to dimensions.

Complexity: This highlights the intricate and multifaceted nature of something.


反义词：

Unidimensionality: This refers to something having only one dimension or aspect, lacking complexity.

Simplicity: This contrasts with the multifaceted nature implied by dimensionalities.


注意：由于dimensionalities本身是dimension的复数形式，且其含义更侧重于“多维性”的抽象概念，所以直接的“反义词”并非完全对应，而是选择与之含义相反的概念。
