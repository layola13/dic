The word "opes" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a breakdown using the requested format.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you be thinking of another word?  Perhaps you could provide more context where you encountered this word.
* It's a very rare or archaic word:  If this is the case, further research into specialized dictionaries or historical texts would be necessary.
* It's a word from a specific dialect or jargon:  Again, context is crucial to understand its meaning and usage.
* It's a newly coined word: This is less likely, but possible.

Please provide more information so I can assist you accurately.
