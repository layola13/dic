The word "prillion" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it in major lexicons such as Merriam-Webster, Oxford English Dictionary, or Cambridge Dictionary.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very niche or informal context.
