nepheline: /ˈnefəlaɪn/ | n. |霞石| A rock-forming mineral consisting of a sodium and potassium aluminosilicate. It is a feldspathoid mineral, meaning it is found in igneous rocks that are poor in silica. Nepheline is often found in association with other feldspathoids, such as leucite and sodalite.  It's used in the production of glass and ceramics due to its high alumina content. |Example:  The geologist identified nepheline as a major component of the volcanic rock.  地质学家确定霞石是火山岩的主要成分。


Example: Nepheline syenite is a valuable source of alumina for the ceramics industry. 霞石正长岩是陶瓷工业中重要的氧化铝来源。|近义词：feldspathoid |反义词：无  |词性：名词
