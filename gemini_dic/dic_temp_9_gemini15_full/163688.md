过去完成时:
The interpreter had already predeclared the libraries before execution. = 解释器在执行之前已经预先声明了库。

将来时:
The developers will predeclare all the variables needed for the new module. = 开发人员将预先声明新模块所需的所有变量。
We will predeclare the data types for better code readability. = 我们将预先声明数据类型以提高代码的可读性。


虚拟语气:
If we had predeclared the function, the code would have run smoothly. = 如果我们预先声明了函数，代码将运行流畅。

被动语态:
All necessary functions were predeclared by the system. = 所有必要的函数都由系统预先声明。
The variables should be predeclared before use. = 变量应该在使用前预先声明。


疑问句:
Were the data structures predeclared in the previous version? = 在之前的版本中，数据结构是否已预先声明？
Have the required libraries been predeclared? = 所需的库是否已预先声明？


否定句:
The function was not predeclared, resulting in a compilation error. = 函数未预先声明，导致编译错误。
The variables were not predeclared properly, leading to unexpected behavior. = 变量没有正确预先声明，导致了意外的行为。


PHRASE->
predeclared variables = 预先声明的变量
predeclared functions = 预先声明的函数
