词源:

From Middle English *gangrene, borrowed from Anglo-French *gangrene, from Late Latin gangraena, from Greek γάγγραινα (gangraina), from γάγγραινον (ganggrainon), neuter present active participle of γαγγραίνω (gangrainō) “I become gangrenous,” from γάγγρα (gaggra) “an eating sore.”  The ultimate origin is probably pre-Greek.
