This word is extremely rare and unlikely to be encountered in everyday English.  It is a plural noun formed by adding "-nesses" to the adjective "nonoffensive."


**Word Formation:**

* **offensive:**  (adj.) causing someone to feel upset, angry, or resentful.
* **non-offensive:** (adj.) not causing offense; inoffensive.
* **nonoffensiveness:** (n.) the state or quality of being non-offensive.
* **nonoffensivenesses:** (n.) plural of nonoffensiveness.


**Usage:**

Because of its rarity and awkwardness, there are no standard grammatical examples or common phrases for "nonoffensivenesses."  The word itself is grammatically correct but functionally problematic.  Native English speakers would almost always prefer alternative phrasing to convey the intended meaning.


**Alternative Phrasing:**

Instead of using "nonoffensivenesses," consider these alternatives depending on the context:

* **Instances of politeness:**  To describe polite behaviors.
* **Acts of consideration:** To highlight thoughtful actions.
* **Examples of respect:** To emphasize respectful conduct.
* **Moments of courtesy:**  To focus on courteous interactions.
* **Lack of aggression:** To describe the absence of aggressive behavior.
* **Inoffensive remarks/actions:**  A more common and natural way to express the idea.


**Example of how to rewrite a sentence using the word:**

Original Sentence (using the rare word):  "The nonoffensivenesses in his communication were notable."

Revised Sentence (using common phrasing): "His communication was notably inoffensive."  or  "His communication showed considerable respect." or "He communicated with remarkable politeness."

There is no need for a dedicated section on grammatical tenses, voice, or phrases for this word due to its impracticality in common usage.  The focus should be on avoiding its use and opting for clearer, more natural alternatives.
