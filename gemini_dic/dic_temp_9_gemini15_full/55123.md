词源:

The word is derived from the verb "disrupt," which comes from the Latin prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart" or "away") and the verb "rumpere" (meaning "to break").  Thus, "disrupt" literally means "to break apart."  The suffix "-ive" transforms the verb into an adjective ("disruptive"), meaning "causing disruption."  The suffix "-ness" changes the adjective into a noun ("disruptiveness"), signifying the state or quality of being disruptive. Finally, "-es" adds the plural marker.
