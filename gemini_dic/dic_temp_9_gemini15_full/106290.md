词源:  The word "knucklesome" is a relatively rare and informal word. It's a combination of "knuckle" (referring to the joints of the fingers, often used in the context of fighting) and the suffix "-some," which indicates a tendency or quality.  Therefore, it literally means "having the qualities of knuckles" in a fighting sense.  There's no specific historical record tracing its precise etymology, but its construction is clearly suggestive of its meaning.
