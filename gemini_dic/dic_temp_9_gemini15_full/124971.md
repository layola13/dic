The word "muggars" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Perhaps you meant "muggers" (someone who robs people, usually violently)?  Or another word entirely?

2. **It's a regional dialect word:**  It might be a term used in a specific region or community, but not widely known.

3. **It's a newly coined word or slang:**  It could be a very recent invention, internet slang, or a word used within a particular group.

4. **It's a made-up word:** It could be entirely fictional.


To help me provide the requested analysis, please clarify the word you intended to ask about.  If you can provide context (where you encountered the word), that would be very helpful.
