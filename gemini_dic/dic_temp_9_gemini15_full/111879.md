logograms:/ˈlɒɡəɡræmz/|/ˈlɑːɡəɡræmz/| n. |表意文字；语素文字|Logograms are symbols that represent words or phrases, rather than individual sounds.  Unlike alphabets, where letters represent sounds, logograms represent entire words or concepts.  Many ancient writing systems, such as Chinese and Egyptian hieroglyphs, relied heavily on logograms.|Example: The Chinese character for "tree" (木) is a logogram, directly representing the concept of a tree rather than its pronunciation.|近义词：ideograms|反义词：alphabets
