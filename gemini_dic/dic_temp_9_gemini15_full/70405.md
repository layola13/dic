The word "figent" is not a word found in standard English dictionaries.  There is no known etymology or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  It's possible that this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific dialect or jargon, or a word entirely fabricated.
