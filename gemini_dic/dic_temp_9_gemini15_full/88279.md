The word "hinter's" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a proper noun (possibly a surname with a possessive apostrophe).  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible without more context.  To provide the requested analysis, I need clarification on the intended word.  Is it a misspelling of another word? Or is it a name?  Please provide more information.
