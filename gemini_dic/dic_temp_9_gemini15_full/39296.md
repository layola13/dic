conicalness's:/kɒnɪkəlnəsɪz/| n. |圆锥形；锥形状态的复数|The word "conicalness's" is grammatically awkward and rarely used. It represents the possessive form of the already uncommon noun "conicalness," which refers to the state or quality of being conical (having the shape of a cone).  It's better to use alternative phrasing.  For example, instead of "the conicalness's of the mountains," one would say "the conical shapes of the mountains" or "the mountains' conical forms."|例句：The study focused on the conicalness's of various volcanic formations. (This sentence is grammatically correct but stylistically poor. A better phrasing would be needed in real usage.)|近义词：conicity, taper, pyramidality|反义词：flatness, planarity
