USAGE->
一般现在时:

The detective investigates whether the death was self-murdered. (This use is more acceptable, though it would generally be rephrased as "whether the death was a suicide".)


一般过去时:
He was self-murdered. (Grammatically awkward; better to say "He committed suicide" or "He died by suicide".)
The evidence suggested that she was self-murdered. (Again, awkward; better to say "The evidence suggested that she had committed suicide.")


现在完成时:
He has been self-murdered. (Grammatically incorrect. The passive voice is not suitable here.)

If he were self-murdered, it would explain many things. (Awkward; "If he had committed suicide, it would explain many things" is better.)
