metaplasia:/ˌmɛtəˈpleɪʒə/| n. |化生|The replacement of one differentiated cell type with another mature differentiated cell type. This change is often a response to chronic irritation or injury. It is considered an adaptive mechanism, but it can also be a precursor to dysplasia and cancer.  | Example:  Chronic irritation from smoking can lead to metaplasia in the respiratory tract, where the normal ciliated columnar epithelium is replaced by stratified squamous epithelium.  慢性刺激吸烟会导致呼吸道化生，正常纤毛柱状上皮被复层鳞状上皮取代。 |近义词：cellular transformation, tissue remodeling|反义词：anaplasia
