The word "frontiniac" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries or linguistic databases.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested in the format.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a proper noun (like a name or place), or a word from a specialized field not widely known.
