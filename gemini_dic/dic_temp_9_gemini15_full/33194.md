chromoplastid:/ˈkroʊməˌplæstɪd/| n. |色素体|A plastid that contains pigments other than chlorophyll, responsible for the color of many fruits, flowers, and roots.  Chromoplasts are organelles found in plant cells and are responsible for the synthesis and storage of pigments such as carotenoids, which give many fruits, flowers, and leaves their characteristic yellow, orange, or red colors. They are involved in attracting pollinators and seed dispersers. |Example: The bright orange color of carrots is due to the chromoplasts in their root cells.  胡萝卜鲜艳的橙色是由于其根细胞中的色素体。|近义词：plastid (更广泛的术语)|反义词：chloroplast (含有叶绿素的质体)
