词源:  The word "outwalloping" is a relatively recent coinage, combining the prefix "out-" (meaning exceeding or surpassing) with "wallop," a verb meaning to hit hard.  The "-ing" suffix creates the adjectival form.  While not found in standard dictionaries, its meaning is readily understood from its components.
