leptons:/ˈlɛptɑːnz/ | n. |轻子 |Leptons are a type of fundamental particle that does not experience the strong nuclear force.  They are elementary particles, meaning they are not made up of smaller constituents.  There are six types of leptons, each with its own antiparticle.  These include the electron, muon, and tau, along with their associated neutrinos.  They participate in weak and electromagnetic interactions. |例句：Electrons, muons, and taus are examples of charged leptons. 电子、μ子和τ子是带电轻子的例子。|例句：Neutrinos are electrically neutral leptons that interact very weakly with matter. 中微子是电中性的轻子，与物质的相互作用非常微弱。|近义词：fundamental particles, elementary particles |反义词：hadrons (particles that experience the strong force)
