The word "decrumbs" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specialized or fictional context.  To provide an analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (A book, website, conversation, etc.)
* **What was the surrounding text?** This will help determine the intended meaning.


If you can provide this context, I can try to offer a possible interpretation and analysis.
