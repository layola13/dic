nonattributive: /ˌnɒnəˈtrɪbjʊtɪv/ | adj. | 非限定性的，非修饰性的 |  Describes a word, phrase, or clause that does not function as an attribute or modifier of another word.  It typically stands alone or is loosely connected to the main clause, unlike attributive elements which directly modify nouns.  | Example:  The statement, "He is a doctor," is nonattributive because "He is a doctor" does not modify any specific noun. In contrast, "the doctor's office" is attributive because "doctor's" modifies "office". | 近义词：independent, freestanding, absolute | 反义词：attributive, modifying
