decouplers:/dɪˈkʌplərz/| n.|解耦器，隔离器|A device or system that decouples or isolates two systems or components, preventing interference or unwanted interaction.  It can be used in various contexts, such as electronics, mechanics, and software.|例句：The engineers used decouplers to isolate the sensitive circuitry from power fluctuations. 工程师们使用解耦器将敏感电路与电源波动隔离开来。


The use of decoupling capacitors is crucial for stable operation of high-speed digital circuits.  使用去耦电容对于高速数字电路的稳定运行至关重要。|近义词：isolator, separator, buffer|反义词：coupler, connector

词源:
The word "decoupler" is a combination of the prefix "de-" (meaning "away from" or "reverse of") and "coupler," which refers to a device that connects or joins two things.  Therefore, a decoupler is a device that separates or disconnects two things.  The word reflects its function of separating or isolating components or systems.
