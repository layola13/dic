pix:/pɪks/| n. |像素，点阵|A pix is a single point of color or light in a digital image.  Pixels are arranged in a grid to form the complete image.  The more pixels an image has, the higher its resolution.|Example: The photograph had a high number of pixels, resulting in a sharp, clear image. = 这张照片像素很高，因此图像清晰锐利。|近义词：dot, element|反义词：N/A

USAGE->
一般现在时:
This image contains millions of pixels. = 这张图片包含数百万像素。
How many pixels does your screen have? = 你的屏幕有多少像素？

一般过去时:
The old camera only captured a few hundred pixels. = 旧相机只能捕捉几百像素。
The image resolution was reduced, losing many pixels. = 图像分辨率降低了，丢失了许多像素。

现在完成时:
We have increased the number of pixels in our images. = 我们已经增加了图像中的像素数量。
They have improved the pixel density of their screens. = 他们提高了屏幕的像素密度。

过去完成时:
The image had already been resized, losing some pixels. = 图片已经被调整大小，丢失了一些像素。
Before the update, the software only supported fewer pixels. = 更新前，该软件只支持较少的像素。


将来时:
We will increase the pixel count for better resolution. = 我们将增加像素数量以获得更好的分辨率。
Future cameras will capture billions of pixels. = 未来的相机将捕捉数十亿像素。


虚拟语气:
If the image had more pixels, it would look sharper. = 如果图像有更多像素，它看起来会更清晰。
I wish this picture had more pixels. = 我希望这张照片有更多像素。


被动语态:
The pixels are arranged in a grid pattern. = 像素以网格图案排列。
The image was enlarged, making the pixels visible. = 图片被放大，使像素可见。


疑问句:
How many pixels are there in this image? = 这张图片有多少像素？
What is the pixel density of this display? = 这个显示器的像素密度是多少？


否定句:
This image doesn't have enough pixels. = 这张图片像素不足。
The resolution wasn't high enough because of fewer pixels. = 由于像素较少，分辨率不够高。


PHRASE->
pixel density  = 像素密度
pixel art = 像素艺术
per pixel = 每像素
pixel pitch = 像素间距
pixel shader = 像素着色器
