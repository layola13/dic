词源:
The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "transportable" (capable of being transported).  "Transportable" itself comes from the verb "transport" (to carry from one place to another), ultimately deriving from Old French *transporter and Latin *transportare (to carry across).
