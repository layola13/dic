词源:
The word "realist" is derived from the French word "réaliste," which in turn comes from the Latin word "realis," meaning "real" or "pertaining to things."  The suffix "-ist" indicates a person who believes in or practices something.  The concept of realism, especially in art and philosophy, emerged as a reaction against idealism and romanticism in the 19th century.
