词源:  The word "engendering" comes from the Old French word "engendrer," meaning "to beget," "to generate," or "to produce."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "ingenerare," which combines "in-" (in, into) and "generare" (to beget, to produce).  The suffix "-ing" indicates the present participle, showing an ongoing action.
