heidens:/ˈhaɪdən(z)/| n.|异教徒；异教徒的；非基督教徒|The word "heidens" is a plural form of "heiden," an archaic and now largely regional term, primarily used in some dialects of German and Dutch, meaning "pagan," "heathen," or "non-Christian." It carries a historical connotation, often implying a negative judgment or a lack of religious adherence to Christianity.  The term's usage is generally avoided in modern, formal contexts due to its potentially offensive nature.|例句：In some older stories, the "heidens" were depicted as fierce warriors. 在一些旧故事中，“异教徒”被描绘成凶猛的战士。  The villagers feared the "heidens" living in the nearby forest. 村民们害怕住在附近森林里的“异教徒”。|近义词：pagans, heathens, infidels|反义词：Christians, believers|名词
