词源:  Derived from "chummy," which originated in the late 19th century as a slang term meaning "friendly" or "intimate."  Its etymology is uncertain, but it may be related to "chum," meaning a close friend, possibly from a dialectal word meaning "fellow" or "companion."  The "-iest" suffix adds a superlative meaning, indicating the highest degree of chumminess.
