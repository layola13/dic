词源: 法语 *rapport*  (meaning "relation, report, account") from Old French *rappost*, from Old Northern French *rapporter*  "to bring back", from *re-* "back" + *porter* "to carry".  The meaning shifted over time from a simple "report" or "relation" to the more nuanced sense of harmonious relationship.
