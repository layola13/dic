This word is extremely rare and not commonly used in everyday language.  It's a noun formed from the adjective "immaterial," meaning not important or relevant.  The added "-ness" suffix transforms it into a noun representing the state or quality of being immaterial.  The further addition of "-es" makes it plural, indicating multiple instances of immateriality.

**Etymology:**

* **im-:**  Prefix indicating "not" or "without."
* **material:**  Derived from Latin "materialis," related to "materia" (matter, substance).  It originally referred to physical substance.
* **-ness:**  Suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.
* **-es:** Plural suffix for nouns ending in -s, -sh, -ch, -x, or -z.

**Usage:**

Because of its rarity, providing examples across various grammatical tenses is impractical.  The word primarily functions as a noun in its few appearances in writing.  Its usage is largely restricted to academic or philosophical contexts where discussing the abstract concept of immateriality is necessary.


**Example Sentence:**

The philosopher explored the immaterialnesses of the soul and its existence independent of the body. 哲学家探讨了灵魂的非物质性及其独立于身体的存在。
