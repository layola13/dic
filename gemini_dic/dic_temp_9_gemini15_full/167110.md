presusceptibilities:/ˌpriːˌsʌsɛptəˈbɪlətiz/| n. |预感性；易感性；预先敏感性|  The word "presusceptibilities" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word or expression.  It's likely formed by combining "pre-" (before, in advance) with "susceptibilities" (the state or fact of being likely or liable to be influenced or harmed by a particular thing).  Therefore, it might imply a predisposition or a heightened sensitivity to something *before* it actually occurs or is experienced.  The meaning would depend heavily on the context in which it's used.  There are no standard examples or usages. |近义词:predispositions, vulnerabilities, sensitivities|反义词:immunities, resistances|名词
