词源:

The word "buttercream" is a compound word, combining "butter" and "cream."  "Butter" originates from Old English *butere, ultimately from Proto-Germanic *buterō. "Cream" comes from Old French creme, from Latin cremor, meaning "cream" or "thick juice".  The combination reflects the primary ingredients of this type of frosting.
