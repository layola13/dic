phyllocladium:/ˌfaɪləʊˈkleɪdiəm/| n. |叶状枝|A flattened, leaf-like stem that functions as a leaf.  Phyllocladia are often found in plants adapted to arid or semi-arid environments, where true leaves may be reduced or absent to minimize water loss. They perform photosynthesis and can bear flowers or fruit. |The butcher's broom has phyllocladia instead of true leaves.|近义词：cladophyll|反义词：无
