nonrelatively: /ˌnɒnˈrelətɪvli/ | adv. | 非相对地，绝对地 |  The word "nonrelatively" is not a standard or commonly used word in English. It's a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "relatively" (meaning "in comparison to something else").  Therefore, it implies something that is not considered or defined in relation to anything else; it's absolute or independent.  However, due to its unusual nature, providing examples and common phrases is difficult and its use should be approached cautiously.  A more common and precise way to express this concept would be to use words like "absolutely," "independently," "intrinsically," or "categorically". |  Because of its rarity, no standard examples or phrases are available.  A potential, albeit contrived, example might be:  "The laws of physics operate nonrelatively; they are independent of any observer's perspective." = 物理定律是非相对的；它们与任何观察者的视角无关。 | 近义词：absolutely, independently, intrinsically, categorically | 反义词：relatively, comparatively
