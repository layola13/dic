diatomicities:/ˌdaɪæˈtɒmɪsətiz/ | n. | 双原子性，二原子性 | The property of existing as a diatomic molecule.  It refers to the tendency of certain elements to form molecules consisting of two atoms of the same element. For example, oxygen exists as O2, exhibiting diatomicity. | Example: The high diatomicity of oxygen allows for efficient respiration in many organisms.  氧气的双原子性使得许多生物能够有效地进行呼吸。 |近义词: bimolecularity | 反义词: monoatomicity

PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "diatomicities". The word is primarily used in scientific contexts.  Instead, phrases related to diatomic molecules or the concept of diatomicity would be more relevant.  For example:

Diatomic molecules: 双原子分子
Diatomic oxygen: 双原子氧
Diatomic nitrogen: 双原子氮
Diatomic gas: 双原子气体
Degree of diatomicity: 双原子性程度
