词源:The word "carousel" ultimately derives from the Italian word *carosello*, which itself comes from the French phrase *carrousel*.  This French phrase originally referred to a type of elaborate equestrian tournament or mock battle popular in the 17th century, often involving a rotating display of skilled riders. The modern amusement ride adapted the name due to the rotational nature of the ride resembling these historical displays.
