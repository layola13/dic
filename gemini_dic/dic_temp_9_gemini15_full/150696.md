The word "paraa" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a word like "para," "pariah," or another word entirely?

2. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name, a place name, or an abbreviation specific to a certain field.  More context is needed.

3. **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.


Without knowing the intended word or more context, a full analysis as requested is impossible. Please provide the correct spelling or more context so I can assist you.
