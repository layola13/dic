The term is also used more broadly to refer to things perceived or experienced in the imagination, especially in relation to psychological or spiritual states.|例句：The imaginal cells are responsible for the development of the adult wings.  想象盘细胞负责成虫翅膀的发育。|近义词：imaginary, fanciful, visionary|反义词：real, actual, concrete

USAGE->
