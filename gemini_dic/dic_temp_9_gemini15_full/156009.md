WORD ORIGIN->
The word "photolithograph" is a combination of three elements:

* **photo-:** From Greek "phos," meaning "light," indicating the use of light in the process.
* **litho-:** From Greek "lithos," meaning "stone," referring to the lithographic printing technique.
* **-graph:** From Greek "graphein," meaning "to write," referring to the creation of an image.

Therefore, "photolithograph" literally means "a light-written stone image," reflecting the process of using light-sensitive materials to create an image that is then printed using lithography.
