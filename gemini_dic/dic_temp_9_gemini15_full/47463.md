词源:
The word "dealer" comes from the Middle English word "delere," meaning "one who deals."  This, in turn, is derived from the Old French word "dealler," ultimately tracing back to the Latin word "dispensator," meaning "one who distributes" or "one who dispenses."  The meaning evolved from a general sense of dealing with something to a specific focus on buying and selling goods.
