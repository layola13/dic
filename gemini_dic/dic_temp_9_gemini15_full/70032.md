词源:
The word "fetishizing" comes from the Portuguese word "feitiço," meaning "charm" or "magic spell," which itself derives from the Latin word "facticius," meaning "artificial" or "made."  The term was initially used in anthropology to describe objects believed to possess magical properties, and later evolved to encompass the psychological phenomenon of assigning excessive importance or sexual attraction to certain objects or practices.
