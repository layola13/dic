pediculous:/pɛˈdɪkjʊləs/| adj.| 患虱子的；充满虱子的 | Infested with lice.  The word describes a condition or state, not the lice themselves.  It suggests a significant infestation. | 例句：The child's hair was pediculous, requiring immediate treatment.  这个孩子的头发长满了虱子，需要立即治疗。


The entire head was pediculous, demanding a thorough cleansing.  整个头部都长满了虱子，需要彻底清洁。


近义词：lousy, infested (with lice) | 反义词：lice-free, clean


词源:  From Latin *pediculus (diminutive of *pex, "louse").  The suffix "-ous" denotes "full of" or "characterized by".  Therefore, "pediculous" literally means "full of lice".
