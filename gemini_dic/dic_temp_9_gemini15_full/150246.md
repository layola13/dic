词源:  Derived from the noun "pander," which ultimately comes from the Greek word "pandēros," meaning "a procurer" or "pimp."  The original sense referred to someone who catered to the base desires of others.  The adjectival form "panderly" retains this sense of obsequiousness and servility, but now often applies to less explicitly immoral forms of appeasement.
