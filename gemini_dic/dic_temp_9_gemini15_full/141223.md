oosphere:/ˈoʊəsfɪər/ | n. | 卵球，卵细胞 | The oosphere is the female gamete (sex cell) in plants, specifically in algae, fungi, and some plants. It is a large, non-motile cell that contains the female genetic material.  The oosphere is fertilized by a sperm cell to form a zygote, which develops into a new organism. | Example: The oosphere of the Chara species is exceptionally large and easily observable under a microscope.  卵球藻的卵球非常大，在显微镜下很容易观察到。|近义词: egg cell, female gamete | 反义词:  sperm, male gamete | 名词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The oosphere awaits fertilization. = 卵球等待受精。
Plants produce oospheres for reproduction. = 植物产生卵球进行繁殖。

一般过去时:
The oosphere was fertilized successfully. = 卵球成功受精了。
Scientists observed the oosphere under the microscope. = 科学家在显微镜下观察了卵球。

现在完成时:
The plant has produced many oospheres this season. = 今年这种植物已经产生了大量的卵球。
Researchers have studied the development of the oosphere. = 研究人员已经研究了卵球的发育。

过去完成时:
The oosphere had already been fertilized before the observation. = 在观察之前，卵球已经被受精了。
The scientists had prepared the oosphere for the experiment. = 科学家们已经为实验准备好了卵球。

将来时:
The oosphere will be fertilized soon. = 卵球很快就会受精。
Researchers will analyze the oosphere's genetic material. = 研究人员将分析卵球的遗传物质。

虚拟语气:
If the oosphere were fertilized, a new plant would grow. = 如果卵球受精了，就会长出一株新的植物。
I wish the oosphere had been better preserved for study. = 我希望卵球能更好地保存起来供研究。

被动语态:
The oosphere is being studied by scientists. = 卵球正在被科学家们研究。
The oosphere was observed using a high-powered microscope. = 卵球是用高倍显微镜观察到的。

疑问句:
Where is the oosphere located in the plant? = 卵球位于植物的哪个部位？
How long does the oosphere remain viable? = 卵球能存活多久？

否定句:
The oosphere was not fertilized. = 卵球没有受精。
The experiment did not yield any viable oospheres. = 实验没有产生任何可存活的卵球。
