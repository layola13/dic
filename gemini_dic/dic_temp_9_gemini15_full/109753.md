词源:  The word "leviathan" originates from the Hebrew word לִוְיָתָן (liwyāṯān), which appears in the Book of Job and the Book of Psalms in the Bible.  It is generally understood to refer to a large sea creature, often translated as "whale" or "sea monster," but its exact meaning has been debated for centuries.  The Hebrew word's etymology is uncertain, but some scholars suggest possible connections to words related to "coiling" or "twisting," perhaps referring to the serpent-like appearance of some large sea creatures.  The word entered English through the Latin *leviathan*, and has since taken on a more metaphorical meaning, referencing something immensely powerful and often destructive.
