excalfactive:/ˌɛksˈkælfæktɪv/| adj.|超出小腿的；过长的 (指衣服或其他物品)|This word is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a newly coined or very rarely used word, likely formed by combining "ex-" (meaning "out of" or "beyond") and "calf" (referring to the back part of the leg below the knee), possibly with "-active" implying an action or state relating to the calf.  The precise meaning would depend on context, but it suggests something extending beyond the calf area. |Example:  The excalfactive trousers were too long for him.
