词源:

The word "disciplinary" is derived from the word "discipline," which comes from the Old French word "discipline," ultimately stemming from the Latin word "disciplina," meaning "instruction, teaching, training."  The Latin word is related to the verb "discipulus," meaning "pupil, disciple."  The sense of "punishment" developed later.
