The word "copalm" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  It's likely a misspelling or a very obscure, niche term.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  If you could provide the correct spelling or more context, I would be happy to help.
