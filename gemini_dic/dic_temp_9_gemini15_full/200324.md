词源:

The word "skullduggery" is believed to be of uncertain origin, but possibly a combination of "skull" (referring to the head, implying cunning or intelligence) and a word related to "dug," suggesting digging or delving into something secretly.  The "-ery" suffix indicates a practice or activity.  Its precise etymological roots remain debated.
