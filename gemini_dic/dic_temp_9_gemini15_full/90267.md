词源:
The word "household" comes from the Old English *hūsgild, which consisted of two elements:  hūs ("house") and gild ("guild," referring to a group or association).  Over time, the meaning shifted from a group of people living together in a house to the house and its inhabitants, evolving to its modern sense.
