词源:  Comes from the combination of "cross-grained," an adjective describing  both difficult people and wood with irregular grain, and the suffix "-ness," which forms nouns signifying a state or quality.  "Cross" implies something going against the usual or expected, while "grained" refers to the texture or structure, particularly of wood.  The original sense related to the difficulty of working with wood having a cross-grained texture, later extended metaphorically to describe difficult personalities.
