parapatric:/ˌpærəˈpæt rɪk/| adj.| 邻域同域的，准同域的 | Relating to or denoting the formation of new species in contiguous (but not completely overlapping) geographic areas.  This occurs when populations are only partially isolated and gene flow occurs between them, but it is limited enough to allow for divergence and speciation. | Example:  Parapatric speciation is less common than allopatric or sympatric speciation.  准同域物种形成比异域或同域物种形成不常见。|近义词：adjacent, bordering |反义词：allopatric, sympatric


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Parapatric speciation is a complex process. = 准同域物种形成是一个复杂的过程。
The researchers study parapatric populations. = 研究人员研究准同域种群。


一般过去时:
Scientists observed parapatric divergence in the field. = 科学家在野外观察到准同域分化。
The study described a case of parapatric speciation. = 这项研究描述了一个准同域物种形成的案例。


现在完成时:
Researchers have documented many examples of parapatric speciation. = 研究人员已经记录了许多准同域物种形成的例子。
The model has shown the possibility of parapatric evolution. = 该模型已经显示了准同域进化的可能性。


过去完成时:
Before the study, little was known about this particular case of parapatric divergence. = 在这项研究之前，人们对这种特殊的准同域分化知之甚少。
They had already established the parapatric nature of the populations. = 他们已经确定了种群的准同域性质。


将来时:
Further research will explore the genetic mechanisms of parapatric speciation. = 进一步的研究将探索准同域物种形成的遗传机制。

虚拟语气:
If the populations were completely isolated, parapatric speciation would not occur. = 如果种群完全隔离，就不会发生准同域物种形成。
It is likely that, if gene flow were higher, parapatric divergence would be less pronounced. = 如果基因流动更高，准同域分化可能就不那么明显了。


被动语态:

What are the key factors driving parapatric divergence? = 推动准同域分化的关键因素是什么？


否定句:
This particular case is not an example of parapatric speciation. = 这个特定案例不是准同域物种形成的例子。
The observed pattern does not support the hypothesis of parapatric divergence. = 观察到的模式不支持准同域分化的假设。
