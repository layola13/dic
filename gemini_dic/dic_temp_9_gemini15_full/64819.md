词源:
The word "espadrille" comes from the Occitan word "espardenya," which in turn derives from the Aragonese word "espardeña."  These words ultimately come from the Latin word "spartum," meaning "esparto grass," a tough, fibrous grass used to make the soles of these shoes.  The shoes themselves have a long history in the Mediterranean region.
