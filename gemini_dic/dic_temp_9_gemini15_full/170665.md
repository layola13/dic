词源:

The word "pseudo-rationalism" is a compound word formed from:

* **pseudo-:**  From the Greek word  ψευδής (pseudēs), meaning "false" or "lying."
* **rationalism:** From "rational" (relating to reason) + "-ism" (a suffix denoting a system, doctrine, or practice).  "Rational" ultimately derives from the Latin word "ratio," meaning "reason" or "reckoning."

Therefore, "pseudo-rationalism" literally means "false rationalism" or a system of thought that falsely claims to be based on reason.
