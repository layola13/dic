词源:
The word "ruthful" is derived from the Old English word "reowþ," meaning "pity, compassion, mercy."  It's related to the word "ruth," which has a similar meaning and is still used, though less frequently, in modern English.  The "-ful" suffix adds the meaning of "full of" or "characterized by."
