词源:  The word "sassy" likely originated in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) in the early 20th century.  Its etymology is uncertain, but it's possibly related to the word "sauce," implying a certain boldness or impudence.  The meaning evolved from simply meaning "bold" or "spirited" to include the connotation of stylishness and confidence.  Its widespread adoption reflects the influence of AAVE on mainstream English.
