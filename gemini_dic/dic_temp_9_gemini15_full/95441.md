英文解析: Incircumscription refers to the state or quality of being without limits or restrictions;  boundlessness. It implies a complete lack of constraint or confinement, allowing for freedom and inclusiveness.  The word combines the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") with "circumscription," which itself means "restriction" or "limitation."


例句:

The research project, due to its incircumscription, yielded a wealth of valuable data.  由于这项研究项目不受限制，因此产生了大量宝贵的数据。


词源:

* **in-**:  A prefix meaning "not," "without," or "opposite of."
* **circum-**: A prefix meaning "around" or "about."
* **scribere**: Latin verb meaning "to write."  This root is also found in words like "describe," "inscribe," and "subscribe."

The original sense of "circumscription" related to drawing a line around something, thus limiting or defining its boundaries.  "Incircumscription" therefore negates that limitation.


USAGE-> (由于incircumscription本身是名词，没有动词形式，因此不适用各种时态的例句)


PHRASE->

(由于incircumscription并非常用词汇，故不提供常用搭配短语)
