deviations:/ˌdiːviˈeɪʃənz/| n. |偏差；背离；离差|The differences between a set of values and their mean.  Deviations can be used to measure the dispersion or spread of a data set.  They are often calculated as the absolute difference between each value and the mean. In statistics, deviations from a norm or standard are analyzed to understand variability and identify outliers.  |例句：The deviations from the planned budget were significant.  预算的偏差相当大。

The study found significant deviations in blood pressure among participants.  研究发现参与者之间的血压存在显著差异。


近义词：variations, departures, discrepancies, anomalies |反义词：conformity, adherence, agreement, consistency |词性：名词


词源：源自拉丁语 *de- (表示“离开”，“偏离”) + *via- (表示“道路”，“途径”)  + -tion (名词后缀)，字面意思是“偏离道路”。


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The data shows significant deviations. = 数据显示出显著的偏差。
These results indicate large deviations from the expected values. = 这些结果表明与预期值存在很大的偏差。

一般过去时:
There were several deviations from the original plan. = 与最初计划相比，有几个偏差。
The experiment revealed unexpected deviations in the test results. = 实验揭示了测试结果中意想不到的偏差。

现在完成时:
There have been many deviations from the original design. = 与最初的设计相比，已经发生了许多偏差。
Scientists have observed several deviations in the patterns of migration. = 科学家们已经观察到迁徙模式的几个偏差。

过去完成时:
Before the discovery, there had been no significant deviations reported. = 在发现之前，没有报告过任何显著的偏差。
By the end of the project, there had been minimal deviations from the schedule. = 到项目结束时，与进度安排相比，偏差最小。

将来时:
We anticipate some deviations in the upcoming quarter. = 我们预计下一个季度会出现一些偏差。
Further analysis will reveal any deviations from the norm. = 进一步的分析将揭示任何与常态的偏差。

虚拟语气:
If there were fewer deviations, the results would be more accurate. = 如果偏差较少，结果将更准确。
It is vital that there be no significant deviations in the manufacturing process. = 制造过程中绝对不能出现明显的偏差。

被动语态:
The deviations were carefully analyzed by the researchers. = 偏差被研究人员仔细分析了。
Any significant deviations will be reported immediately. = 任何显著的偏差都将立即报告。

疑问句:
Are there any significant deviations in the data? = 数据中是否存在任何显著的偏差？
What are the possible causes of these deviations? = 这些偏差的可能原因是什么？

否定句:
There were no significant deviations from the standard procedure. = 与标准程序相比，没有显著的偏差。
The study showed no significant deviations in the experimental groups. = 研究显示实验组之间没有显著的偏差。


PHRASE->
standard deviation = 标准差
mean deviation = 平均偏差
deviation from the norm = 偏离常态
deviation from the mean = 偏离平均值
significant deviation = 显著偏差
