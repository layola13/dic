词源:  The word "partage" is derived directly from the Old French word *partager*, meaning "to share" or "to divide".  This in turn has roots in the Vulgar Latin *partire*, which is related to the classical Latin *partiri*, meaning "to divide" or "to share".  The word's ultimate origin lies in the Proto-Indo-European root *per-*, meaning "through" or "across".  This reflects the idea of dividing something *through* or *across* multiple recipients.
