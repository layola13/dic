nonnotional: /nɒnˈnoʊʃənəl/ | adj. | 非概念的，非表意的 |  Relating to or denoting words or phrases that do not express a concept or refer to a concrete object but rather perform a grammatical function.

They lack independent semantic meaning but are crucial for sentence structure and meaning. |  The sentence "The cat sat on the mat" contains both notional and nonnotional words.  The words "cat," "sat," and "mat" are notional, while "the" and "on" are nonnotional. | 近义词: grammatical, functional | 反义词: notional, semantic
