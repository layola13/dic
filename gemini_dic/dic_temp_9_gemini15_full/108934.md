The word "leef" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word like "leaf," "lief," or a word from another language?  Please double-check your spelling.
* **A dialect word:**  It might be a regional or archaic term not widely known.
* **A newly coined word:**  It might be a neologism (newly invented word) not yet included in dictionaries.
* **A proper noun:** Possibly a name or place name.
