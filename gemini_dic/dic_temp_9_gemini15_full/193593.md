self-assembly:/ˈsɛlf əˈsɛmbli/| n.|自组装|The spontaneous organization of components into a more complex structure without external guidance or direction.  This process is often driven by non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, hydrophobic interactions, and electrostatic interactions.  It's a fundamental principle in various fields, including materials science, nanotechnology, and biology.|例句：The researchers observed self-assembly of nanoparticles into a well-defined structure. 研究人员观察到纳米粒子自组装成一个明确定义的结构。|例句：Self-assembly is a key process in the formation of biological structures like cell membranes. 自组装是像细胞膜这样的生物结构形成的关键过程。|近义词：spontaneous organization, self-organization |反义词：directed assembly, external assembly
