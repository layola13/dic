glebosity:/ɡləˈbɒsəti/ | n. |冗长；啰嗦；冗赘 | Excessive use of words; wordiness.  The speech was characterized by its glebosity, making it difficult to follow the main points.  |近义词：verbosity, prolixity, long-windedness |反义词：brevity, conciseness


Etymology:  The word "glebosity" is derived from the Latin word "globus," meaning "sphere," and the suffix "-osity," which indicates a state or quality.  The connection is somewhat indirect; the idea is that excessive speech is like a large, unwieldy sphere of words.  However,  it's more likely a back-formation from "globose" (meaning spherical or round),  reflecting the image of a bloated, overly full speech.
