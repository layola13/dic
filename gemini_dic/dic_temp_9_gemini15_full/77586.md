The word "gedds" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible. It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (a name, place, etc.),  a slang term, or a word from a very specialized or obscure dialect.  To provide an analysis, I need more context about where you encountered this word.
