dipole:/ˈdaɪpoʊl/|/ˈdaɪpoʊl/| n. |偶极子，偶极，双极子 |A dipole is a pair of equal and oppositely charged or magnetized poles separated by a distance.  It's a fundamental concept in physics and chemistry, describing the separation of positive and negative charges within a molecule or system.  The strength of a dipole is measured by its dipole moment. | Example: Water molecules are polar, meaning they possess a dipole moment due to the unequal sharing of electrons between the oxygen and hydrogen atoms.  水分子是极性的，这意味着由于氧原子和氢原子之间电子共享的不均等，它们具有偶极矩。|近义词：polar molecule (for electric dipoles), magnetic doublet |反义词：monopole (a single pole)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The water molecule acts as a dipole. = 水分子起着偶极子的作用。
This system exhibits a strong dipole moment. = 这个系统表现出很强的偶极矩。


一般过去时:
The experiment measured the dipole moment of the molecule. = 实验测量了分子的偶极矩。
Scientists discovered the dipole nature of the substance. = 科学家发现了该物质的偶极性质。


现在完成时:
Researchers have confirmed the existence of this dipole. = 研究人员已经证实了这种偶极子的存在。
We have observed a significant dipole interaction. = 我们观察到了一种显著的偶极相互作用。


过去完成时:
They had already calculated the dipole moment before the experiment. = 他们在实验之前已经计算出了偶极矩。
Scientists had previously hypothesized the presence of a dipole. = 科学家之前曾假设存在偶极子。


将来时:
We will analyze the dipole behavior under different conditions. = 我们将在不同的条件下分析偶极子的行为。
The experiment will determine the magnitude of the dipole. = 该实验将确定偶极子的强度。


虚拟语气:
If the molecule were nonpolar, it would not have a dipole moment. = 如果分子是非极性的，它就不会有偶极矩。
It would be helpful if we had a better understanding of dipole interactions. = 如果我们对偶极相互作用有更好的理解，那将会有所帮助。


被动语态:
The dipole moment was calculated using a sophisticated method. = 偶极矩是使用一种复杂的方法计算出来的。
The effect of the dipole is being investigated. = 偶极子的效应正在被研究。


疑问句:
Does this molecule possess a dipole moment? = 这个分子具有偶极矩吗？
What is the direction of the dipole? = 偶极子的方向是什么？


否定句:
This molecule does not exhibit a significant dipole moment. = 这个分子没有表现出明显的偶极矩。
The results did not support the hypothesis of a dipole interaction. = 结果不支持偶极相互作用的假设。
