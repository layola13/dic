词源:

The word "nonacquiescences" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "acquiescences" (meaning "the act of acquiescing" or "passive acceptance").  "Acquiescence" itself comes from the Old French word "acquiescer," which in turn derives from the Latin "acquiescere," meaning "to rest in," "to be at rest," or "to agree." Therefore, "nonacquiescences" literally means "instances of not agreeing" or "instances of not accepting."
