USAGE->
This word is unusual and rarely used.  The possessive form is generally avoided in favour of alternative phrasing to avoid awkwardness.  Instead of "quietness's effect," one would typically say "the effect of quietness" or "the quietness's effect on me was profound".  Therefore, providing examples for grammatical tenses is not practical for this specific word.

PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "quietness's".  The possessive form is grammatically correct but stylistically awkward and should be avoided in most writing.  Instead, use alternative phrasing.

For example, instead of "quietness's embrace," consider "the embracing quietness," "the quietness embraced me," or "I was embraced by the quietness."
