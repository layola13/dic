词源：The word "petulant" comes from the Late Latin word *petulans*, meaning "wanton, saucy, insolent".  This, in turn, is derived from the Latin verb *petere*, meaning "to seek, strive for, attack, rush upon".  The sense shift from "aggressive striving" to "irritable" likely arose from the association of petulant behavior with a child's insistent demands and displays of temper.
