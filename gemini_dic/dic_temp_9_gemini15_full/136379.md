词源:
The word "nonrestitution" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the noun "restitution," which comes from the Latin word "restitutio," meaning "a restoring, a replacement."  Therefore, "nonrestitution" literally means "not a restoring" or "not a replacement," indicating a failure to restore or compensate.
