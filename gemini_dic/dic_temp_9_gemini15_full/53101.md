/dɪpˈθɒŋɡaɪzeɪʃən/ | n. | 双元音化 | The process of a monophthong (a single vowel sound) changing into a diphthong (a vowel sound with two distinct parts).  It's a phonetic process that can occur in the evolution of a language.  For example, the pronunciation of the vowel in the word "price" has diphthongized in many dialects of English. | The Great Vowel Shift involved significant diphthongization of long vowels in English. The pronunciation of "time" shows diphthongization, moving from a pure vowel sound to one with a glide. | 近义词: vowel shift, sound change | 反义词: monophthongization
