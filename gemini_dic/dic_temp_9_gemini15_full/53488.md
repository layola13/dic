词源:
The word "disarticulate" comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart" or "away") and the word "articulate," which comes from the Latin word "articulatus," meaning "jointed."  Therefore, "disarticulate" literally means "to separate the joints."  The extension of the meaning to "speak unclearly" reflects the idea of a breakdown in the structured and coherent delivery of speech, similar to a joint being separated.
