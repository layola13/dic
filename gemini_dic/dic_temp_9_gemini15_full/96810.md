词源:
The word "inertia" comes from the Latin word "iners," meaning "idle," "inactive," or "sluggish."  This reflects the original understanding of inertia as a resistance to change in motion.  The scientific concept of inertia as described by Newton's first law of motion further solidified its usage.
