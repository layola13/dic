词源:  From Latin *praecipiens, present participle of praecipere "to seize beforehand, anticipate," from prae- "before" + capere "to take, seize."  The sense evolved to mean "to instruct, command," and ultimately to "foretell, predict."  The adjective "precipient" developed from this predictive sense.
