minicyclones: /ˈmɪniˈsaɪkloʊnz/ | n. | 微型气旋 | Small-scale cyclonic weather systems, typically characterized by strong winds and heavy rainfall within a relatively small area. They are often associated with larger weather systems but can also form independently.  | Example: The coastal region experienced several minicyclones during the storm, causing localized flooding.  沿海地区在暴风雨期间经历了几次微型气旋，造成局部洪水。 | 近义词：small cyclone, mesoscale convective vortex (MCV),  | 反义词：anticyclone |  无
