词源:
The word "presatisfy" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and the verb "satisfy."  It's a relatively modern coinage, appearing as a need arose to describe actions taken to meet requirements *before* they become formally binding.  There isn't a long and complex etymology as with some older words.
