The word "outinvents" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word or phrase.  Therefore, a full etymological breakdown and grammatical analysis as requested are impossible.  To provide a response in the requested format would require inventing definitions and usage.  Creating a fabricated entry would be misleading.
