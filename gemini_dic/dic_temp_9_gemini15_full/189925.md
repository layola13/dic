The word "sanableness" is relatively uncommon in modern English.  It's a noun formed from the adjective "sanable," meaning "capable of being healed or cured; curable." However, in the context of "sanableness," the root meaning has shifted to emphasize the quality of being reasonable, sensible, or sound in judgment.  The development suggests a semantic shift from physical healing to mental or moral soundness.

The word's origins trace back to the Latin word "sanare," meaning "to heal, cure, make whole."  Through Old French and Middle English, the sense evolved to incorporate the idea of making something right or sound.  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix that forms nouns of quality or state.  Therefore, "sanableness" denotes the state or quality of being reasonable or sound.


例句:

The plan's sanableness is questionable given the lack of resources.  考虑到资源匮乏，该计划的合理性令人质疑。
