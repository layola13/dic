词源:

The word "prepensive" comes from the Latin prefix "prae-" meaning "before" or "in advance," and the Latin word "pensare," meaning "to weigh," "to consider," or "to ponder."  Thus, "prepensive" literally means "thinking beforehand" or "premeditated."  The "-ive" suffix transforms the word into an adjective.
