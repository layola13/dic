logogram:/ˈlɒɡəɡræm/| n. |表意文字；语素文字|A logogram is a written character that represents a word or phrase, rather than a single sound (phoneme) like a letter in an alphabet.  Unlike alphabetic writing systems, logograms do not directly represent sounds.  Each character typically represents an entire word or morpheme.  Many ancient writing systems, such as cuneiform and hieroglyphs, were primarily logographic.  Modern writing systems often incorporate logograms, such as numerals (1, 2, 3) and symbols (+, -, =).|Examples: The Chinese character for "river" (河) is a logogram. The dollar sign ($) is a logogram. |近义词：ideogram, symbol |反义词：alphabet, phonetic character
