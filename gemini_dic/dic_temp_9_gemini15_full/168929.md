词源:
The word "professorship" is derived from "professor" + "-ship."  "Professor" ultimately comes from the Latin "professōr," meaning "one who professes,"  referring to one who publicly declares their knowledge and skill in a particular field, often through teaching.  The "-ship" suffix indicates a state, condition, or rank.
