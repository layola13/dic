The word "overoffends" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism (a newly coined word or expression) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  However, we can analyze its potential meaning and construction.


It seems to be a combination of "over-" (a prefix meaning excessively or to a great extent) and "offends" (the third-person singular present tense of the verb "to offend," meaning to cause someone to feel hurt, angry, or resentful).  Therefore, "overoffends" might be intended to mean "offends excessively" or "offends to an extreme degree."
