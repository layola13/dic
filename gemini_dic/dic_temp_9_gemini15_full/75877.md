functor:/ˈfʌŋktər/| n. |函子，泛函|In mathematics and computer science, a functor is a type of mapping between categories.  It's a function that takes objects and morphisms from one category and maps them to objects and morphisms in another category, while preserving the structure of the category.  In simpler terms, it's a way to transform one structured system into another while maintaining relationships between its parts.|Example: In category theory, a functor F: C → D maps objects of category C to objects of category D, and morphisms of C to morphisms of D, such that F(f ∘ g) = F(f) ∘ F(g) for composable morphisms f and g.  This means that the functor preserves composition.|近义词：mapping, transformation|反义词：None (no direct antonym)|名词
