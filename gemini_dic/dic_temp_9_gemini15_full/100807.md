词源:

Intriguing comes from the verb "intrigue," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "intriguer," meaning "to entangle, ensnare."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "intricare," meaning "to entangle." The sense of mystery and hidden complexity associated with "intrigue" is derived from the image of something being tangled or complicated.
