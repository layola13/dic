polysyntheticism:/ˌpɒliˌsɪnˈθɛtɪkɪzəm/| n. |多式综合性（语言学）|The phenomenon in linguistics where a single word can express the meaning of an entire sentence in other languages.  This is achieved through the extensive use of affixes (prefixes and suffixes) to incorporate multiple grammatical elements and lexical content into a single word. Polysynthetic languages are characterized by their highly complex morphology and relatively simple syntax. |Example:  In some polysynthetic languages, a single word might incorporate information about the subject, object, verb tense, aspect, mood, and even locative information.  For example, a single word might translate to "He was diligently fishing for salmon near the river yesterday." in English. |近义词：agglutination (though less extreme), incorporation |反义词：isolating language, analytic language


USAGE->

There are no typical usages of "polysyntheticism" in the same way that there are for common verbs or nouns.  Polysyntheticism is a linguistic concept describing a characteristic of certain languages.  Therefore, examples would focus on *illustrating* the concept rather than using it in a sentence in various tenses.

Example 1 illustrating Polysynthetic Morphology:

The Inuit language is known for its polysynthetic nature.  A single word might contain elements expressing the subject, object, action, location, and time.  This contrasts sharply with English, where such information would require a whole sentence.


Example 2 illustrating the contrast with analytic languages:

English, an analytic language, tends to use many separate words to express the same information conveyed by a single polysynthetic word.  The difference in sentence structure reflects the contrast between analytic and polysynthetic language types.


PHRASE->

There are no common phrases directly using "polysyntheticism". The term is used academically in linguistic analysis.  Phrases would relate to the *concept* itself, such as:

1.  polysynthetic language family
2.  degree of polysyntheticism
3.  polysynthetic morphology
4.  characteristics of polysynthetic languages
5.  examples of polysynthetic languages
