词源:The word "cabriolet" ultimately derives from the French word "cabriolet," which originally referred to a type of two-wheeled horse-drawn carriage.  This carriage was characterized by its light construction and open design. Over time, the term evolved to describe a type of automobile with a retractable roof.  The French word itself likely originates from the verb "cabrioler," meaning "to caper" or "to leap," possibly referencing the carriage's nimble movement.
