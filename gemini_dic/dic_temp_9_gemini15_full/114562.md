The word "malawis" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps a proper noun (like a place name) with a slightly different spelling?  Providing more context about where you encountered this word would be helpful.

2. **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word, a word used within a specific community or context, or slang. Again, context is crucial.

3. **It's a name:** It could be a proper noun, possibly a person's name or a place name.


Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format because the word lacks a standard definition and usage.  Please clarify the context in which you encountered "malawis".
