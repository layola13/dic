词源:
The word "eyeful" is a compound word, combining "eye" and "ful," a suffix meaning "full of."  It literally means "full of what the eye can see," but figuratively indicates something visually striking or attractive.  The word's usage developed over time, shifting from a more literal meaning to its current figurative one.
