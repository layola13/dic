The word "dartars" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a very specialized dialect or field, or a proper noun.  To provide the requested analysis, more context is needed.  For example:


* **Where did you encounter this word?** (A book, a website, a conversation, etc.)
* **What was the surrounding text or conversation?** This will help determine the intended meaning.


If you can provide this context, I can try to offer a plausible interpretation and analysis based on what it might be.
