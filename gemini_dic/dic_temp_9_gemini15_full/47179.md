词源：
The phrase "day-in-and-day-out" is a compound formed by combining the preposition "in" with the noun "day" twice, and linking them with "and". It's a fixed phrase, meaning its meaning doesn't derive from the individual parts separately but rather from the entire expression.  The origin is idiomatic and reflects the natural rhythm of daily life.  There's no single historical source pinpointing its creation.
