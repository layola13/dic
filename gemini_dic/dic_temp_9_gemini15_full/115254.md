词源:

From Middle French *manipulation, from Latin manipulatio, from manus "hand" + -pulus "full of" + -atio "act of".  The original meaning referred to the act of handling something with the hands.  Over time, the meaning expanded to include the more figurative sense of skillful or devious control and influence.
