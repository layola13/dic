词源:
The word "chandelier" comes from the French word "chandelier," which ultimately derives from the Old French "chandelier," meaning "candlestick."  The original meaning referred to a simple candlestick, but over time, it evolved to describe the elaborate, multi-branched lighting fixtures we know today.
