overtruthfulnesses:/ˌoʊvərˈtruːθfʊlnəsɪz/| n.|过度诚实；过分坦率|The word "overtruthfulnesses" is not a standard English word.  It's a contrived formation, combining "over-" (meaning excessively) with "truthfulness" (the quality of being truthful) and adding the plural "-es". It suggests instances or examples of being excessively truthful, perhaps to a point of being tactless or harmful.  There is no established meaning or usage in dictionaries or common language.  Because it's not a real word, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage is impossible.  To convey the intended meaning, one would use alternative phrasing such as "excessive honesty," "overly frank statements," or "unnecessary revelations."|例句： (This word does not have standard usage, therefore no example sentences can be provided.  A sentence using its components might be: His over-truthfulness often led to hurt feelings.)|近义词： (N/A -  The word is not standard)|反义词： (N/A - The word is not standard)|词性: n.
