词源:

The word "remittal" comes from the verb "remit," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "remittere," meaning "to send back," "to let go," or "to forgive."  The prefix "re-" indicates "back" or "again," and "mittere" means "to send."  Thus, the original meaning encompassed both the sending back of something (like money) and the letting go of something (like a penalty).
