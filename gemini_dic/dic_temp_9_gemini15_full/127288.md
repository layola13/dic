词源:
The word "navigate" comes from the Latin word "navigare," which is formed from "navis" (ship) and "agere" (to drive or lead).  Therefore, the original meaning was literally "to drive a ship."  Over time, the meaning broadened to include the broader sense of finding one's way, whether physically or metaphorically.
