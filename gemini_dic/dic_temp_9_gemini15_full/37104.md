comblessness's:/ˈkoʊm.ləs.nəs.ɪz/| n.|无梳状结构的（状态）|The word "comblessness's" is a highly unusual and arguably ungrammatical formation. It appears to be an attempt to create a possessive form of "comblessness," which itself is already a noun describing the state of lacking combs or a comb-like structure.  The double possessive ('s) is redundant and awkward. A more natural way to express this would be to use a phrase like "the state of being combless" or "the lack of combs." There are no standard dictionaries that list this word.  Therefore, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage is impossible as it's not a recognized word in standard English.|例句: This is not a standard word and therefore cannot be used in a proper sentence. |近义词: lack of combs, absence of combs, comblessness (without the additional 's) |反义词: having combs, possessing combs, being combed
