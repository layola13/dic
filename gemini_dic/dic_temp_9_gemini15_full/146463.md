词源:

The word is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great degree) and "frugal" (meaning economical in use or expenditure; sparing).  "Frugal" itself comes from the Middle English word "frugal," which has roots in the Latin word "frugi" meaning "fruitful, useful, successful, profitable."  Therefore, "overfrugally" means excessively economical or sparing, often to the point of being miserly.
