Word Origin:

The word "inscrutablenesses" is derived from the adjective "inscrutable," which comes from the Latin prefix "in-" (not), "scrutari" (to search or examine thoroughly), and the suffix "-able" (capable of being).  Therefore, "inscrutable" means "not able to be searched or examined thoroughly," hence, "unfathomable," "mysterious."  Adding the suffix "-ness" creates the noun form "inscrutableness," meaning "the state or quality of being inscrutable."  The final "-es" adds the plural.
