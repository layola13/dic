detectabilities:/dɪˌtɛktəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可检测性；可察觉性 | The ability to be detected or perceived.  It refers to the extent to which something can be detected, often in the context of a specific method or instrument.  This is a measure of how easily something can be observed or measured. | Example: The detectabilities of the different chemical compounds varied widely depending on the analytical technique employed.  不同化合物根据所采用的分析技术，其可检测性差异很大。|近义词: measurability, perceivability, discernibility | 反义词: undetectability, imperceptibility | 名词
