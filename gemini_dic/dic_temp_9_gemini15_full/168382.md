词源:
The word "proacting" is a relatively recent addition to the English language, formed by combining the prefix "pro-" (meaning "before" or "in advance of") with the verb "acting."  It's essentially a back-formation from "proactive," giving it a more active and dynamic feel. While not found in traditional dictionaries, its use reflects a growing emphasis on proactive behavior in various fields.
