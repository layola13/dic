词源:

The word "overnervously" is formed by adding the prefix "over-" to the adverb "nervously."  "Over-" indicates excess or to a greater degree than normal. "Nervously" derives from the adjective "nervous," ultimately from the Latin word "nervus," meaning "nerve," referring to the physical and emotional state of being nervous.


用法说明:

overnervously is an adverb modifying a verb, describing how an action is performed. It emphasizes the excessive nature of the nervousness.  There is no specific grammatical tense associated with the word itself; it modifies verbs in any tense.  For example:

过去时：He spoke overnervously. (他说话过于紧张。)
现在时：She acts overnervously. (她行为举止过于紧张。)
将来时：He will speak overnervously. (他会过于紧张地说话。)

It's important to note that "overnervously" is less common than "nervously" and often implies a degree of awkwardness or inappropriateness due to the excessive nervousness.
