performability: /ˌpɜːfɔːrməˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可执行性，性能，可行性 | The ability of a system to perform its intended function.  It often involves considerations of reliability, availability, and maintainability.  | Example: The performability of the new software was rigorously tested before release. 新软件的可执行性在发布前进行了严格测试。The performability of the aircraft was a major concern during the design phase.  飞机的可行性是设计阶段的主要关注点。|近义词：performance, capability, feasibility | 反义词：unfeasibility, unreliability


USAGE->
