fullerenes:/ˈfʊlərˌiːnz/ | n. |富勒烯 |A fullerene is a molecule composed entirely of carbon, in the form of a hollow sphere, ellipsoid, tube, or many other shapes.  Fullerenes are similar in structure to graphite, which is composed of sheets of linked hexagons, but they contain pentagons (and sometimes heptagons) that allow the sheets to curve and form closed structures.  They are named after Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic domes they resemble. | Example:  Scientists are exploring the potential applications of fullerenes in nanotechnology.  科学家们正在探索富勒烯在纳米技术中的潜在应用。  The discovery of C60 fullerene revolutionized chemistry. C60富勒烯的发现彻底改变了化学。 |近义词: buckyballs (for C60), carbon nanotubes | 反义词:  (No direct antonym exists, as it's a specific type of molecule.) |  词性：名词
