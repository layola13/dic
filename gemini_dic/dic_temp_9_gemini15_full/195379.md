词源:

The word "semimetaphorical" is a combination of:

* **semi-**: a prefix meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."
* **metaphorical**: relating to or characterized by metaphor (a figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable).

Therefore, "semimetaphorical" literally means "partly metaphorical."
