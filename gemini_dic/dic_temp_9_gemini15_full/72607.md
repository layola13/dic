词源:

The word "fly-tipping" is a compound word.  "Fly" here doesn't refer to insects but is a slang term meaning "secretly" or "quickly".  "Tipping" refers to the act of dumping or discarding something.  Therefore, fly-tipping literally means secretly or quickly dumping waste illegally.  The origin is British English and its usage is primarily confined to that context.
