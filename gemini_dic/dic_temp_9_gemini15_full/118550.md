mesonephros:/ˌmɛzoʊˈnɛfrɒs/| n.|中肾|The mesonephros is an embryonic organ that develops into the adult urinary system in some vertebrates and contributes to the reproductive system in others.  It is a temporary kidney that functions during early development before the metanephros (the permanent kidney) takes over. |Example:  The development of the mesonephros is crucial for the formation of the urinary and reproductive systems in many animals. 中肾的发育对于许多动物泌尿和生殖系统的形成至关重要。|近义词：Wolffian body (同义词)|反义词：metanephros (功能上的反义词)|名词
