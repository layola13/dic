词源:
The word "fumble" originates from the Middle English word "fumblen," meaning "to grope or feel about clumsily."  This, in turn, likely derives from an Old French word of similar meaning,  possibly related to the Old Norse "fumla," meaning "to handle clumsily."  The sense of making mistakes or failing in an action evolved over time from the original meaning of clumsy handling.
