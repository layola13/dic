shearless:/ˈʃɪərləs/| adj.|无剪切的，无剪力的|Not involving or subject to shear; lacking shear.  The term often appears in engineering and materials science contexts, referring to materials or processes that do not experience or induce shearing forces. |Example: The shearless connection design minimized stress concentration.  无剪切连接设计最大限度地减少了应力集中。  The shearless mixing process preserved the integrity of the delicate cells. 无剪切混合过程保持了精细细胞的完整性。|近义词：shearing-free, stress-free|反义词：sheared, under shear stress|词性:形容词
