词源:

The word "enfranchisable" is derived from the verb "enfranchise," which itself comes from the Old French word "enfranchir," meaning "to free, to liberate."  The "en-" prefix intensifies the action, and "-able" adds the adjectival suffix indicating capability.  The root of "franchise" ultimately relates to the concept of freedom and liberty, particularly in the context of legal rights.
