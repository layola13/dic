词源:

The word "oppressible" is derived from the verb "oppress," which comes from the Latin word "oppressus," the past participle of "opprimere."  "Opprimere" is a compound word formed from "ob-" (against, toward) and "premere" (to press, to weigh down). Therefore, the root meaning points to the act of pressing down upon or weighing down someone or something.  The suffix "-ible" means "capable of being" or "worthy of being," thus creating the adjective "oppressible."
