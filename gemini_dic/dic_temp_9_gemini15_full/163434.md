词源:  The word "preconsumption" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the noun "consumption" (the act of using or consuming something).  Therefore, it literally means "before consumption."  The term emerged as a concept in marketing and economics to describe activities and costs associated with evaluating a product or service *before* a purchase is made.
