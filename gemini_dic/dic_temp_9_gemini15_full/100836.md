词源:
The word "introflexed" is derived from the prefix "intro-" (meaning "inward" or "within") and the word "flexed" (related to "flex," meaning "to bend").  Therefore, it literally means "bent inward," reflecting the inward-turning nature of the concept.  The psychological meaning developed over time.
