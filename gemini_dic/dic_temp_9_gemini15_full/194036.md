词源:  The word is a combination of "self" and "fruition." "Self" is of Old English origin, referring to oneself. "Fruition" comes from the Old French "fruicion," ultimately from the Latin "fructus," meaning "fruit" or "enjoyment," suggesting the result or enjoyment of effort.  Therefore, self-fruition literally means the "fruit" or "enjoyment" of one's own efforts.
