词源:
The word "criticism" comes from the Middle French word "critique," which itself originates from the Greek word "kritikos" (κριτικός), meaning "able to judge,"  "discerning," or "critical."  The root is "krinein" (κρίνειν), meaning "to separate," "to decide," or "to judge."  Thus, the core meaning relates to the act of careful judgment and evaluation.
