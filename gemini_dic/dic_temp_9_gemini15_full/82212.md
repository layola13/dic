词源: The word "grotesque" originates from the Italian word "grottesco," which in turn derives from the Italian word "grotta," meaning "cave."  This is because during the Renaissance, many newly discovered Roman caves were decorated with strange and fantastical paintings and sculptures. These works, often featuring distorted figures and hybrid creatures, were termed "grottesche," leading to the adoption of "grotesque" into English with a similar meaning.  The connection to caves highlights the unexpected and unusual nature of the art.
