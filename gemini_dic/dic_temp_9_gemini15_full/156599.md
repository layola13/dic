词源:
The word "picnic" originates from the French phrase "pique-nique," which literally translates to "pick-me-up" or "something to peck at."  It emerged in the late 18th century and entered English usage in the early 19th century.  The original meaning implied a social gathering where each participant brought a portion of the food.
