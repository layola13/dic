词源:
The word "disembarrass" comes from the Old French *desembarrasser*, a combination of the prefix *des-* (meaning "to remove" or "from") and *embarrasser* (meaning "to hamper" or "to embarrass").  The ultimate root traces back to the Old French word *barras*, meaning "obstacle" or "impediment", related to the Spanish word *barrera* (barrier).
