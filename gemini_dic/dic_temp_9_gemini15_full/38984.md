Word Origin:

The word "confirmabilities" is derived from the verb "confirm" and the suffix "-ability".

* **Confirm:**  From Old French *confirmer*, from Latin *confirmare* "to strengthen, make firm," from *con-* "together" + *firmare* "to make firm," from *firmus* "firm, strong."

* **-ability:** A suffix forming nouns meaning "the quality or state of being able to be..."


Therefore, "confirmabilities" signifies the quality or state of being able to be confirmed or verified.
