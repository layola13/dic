The word "sads" is not a standard English word.  There's no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, informal variation, or a word used in a very niche context.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It might be intended as a plural form of "sad," but even then, the proper plural is simply "sad things" or "sad feelings," not "sads."
