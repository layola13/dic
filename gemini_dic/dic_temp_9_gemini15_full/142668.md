词源:
The word "ostrich" comes from the Middle English "ostrich," which itself derives from Old French "autruche," and ultimately from Latin "avis struthio," where "avis" means "bird" and "struthio" referred to a type of large bird, possibly originating from Greek.  The specific Greek origin is debated, but it likely related to words describing swiftness or strength.
