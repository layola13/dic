词源:

The word "fragmentarinesses" is derived from:

* **fragment:**  From Latin *fragmentum* ("a broken piece"), ultimately from *frangere* ("to break").
* **-ary:**  A suffix forming adjectives meaning "of the nature of," "relating to," or "characterized by."
* **-ness:**  A suffix forming nouns of state or quality.
* **-es:** Plural suffix.

Therefore, "fragmentarinesses" literally means "the states or qualities of being characterized by fragments or broken pieces."
