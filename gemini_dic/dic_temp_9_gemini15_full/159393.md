The term "Polander" can sometimes carry a slightly outdated or even mildly offensive connotation in some contexts, particularly if used in a way that emphasizes ethnicity over nationality or citizenship.  It's generally safer and more inclusive to use "person from Poland" or "Polish person" unless the context specifically calls for the term "Polander".|近义词:Polish person, person from Poland|反义词:None specifically, but could be contrasted with people of other nationalities.|名词
