词源:  From Middle English *epithet, from Old French epithete, from Late Latin epitheton, from Greek ἐπίθετον (epítheton), neuter of ἐπίθετος (epíthetos) “added, applied,” from ἐπι- (epi-) “upon, on” + -θετος (-thetos), past participle of τίθημι (títhēmi) “I put, I place.”  The original meaning referred to something added or placed upon something else, later evolving to its current usage describing added descriptive terms.
