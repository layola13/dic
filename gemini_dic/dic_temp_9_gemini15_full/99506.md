PHRASE->
There are no common multi-word phrases using "interfoliate."  The word itself is quite specific and rarely used in idiomatic expressions.

词源:
From Latin *inter- ("between") + Latin folium ("leaf").  It combines the prefix "inter-" meaning "between" or "among" with the stem related to "folium," the Latin word for "leaf."  This accurately reflects the meaning of the word: growing between leaves.
