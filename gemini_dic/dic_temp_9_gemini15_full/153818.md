PHRASE->
There is no common phrase directly using "perceivednesses".  The word itself is relatively uncommon and often used in academic contexts.  Instead, phrases using related words like "perceptions" or "perceived" are more frequent.  For example:

词源:

The word "perceivednesses" is derived from the verb "perceive" + "-ed" (past participle) + "-ness" (noun suffix).  "Perceive" comes from the Latin word "percipere," meaning "to seize, grasp, or understand."  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective or verb into a noun, indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, "perceivednesses" refers to the state or quality of being perceived.
