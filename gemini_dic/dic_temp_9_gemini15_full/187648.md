The word "ronnen" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage description cannot be provided.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?

2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name (person, place, or thing) or a brand name specific to a certain region or field.  More context is needed.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a word used within a specific community, or slang not yet widely recognized.

4. **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into standard English.  If you can provide the language of origin, it might be possible to offer a translation and explanation.
