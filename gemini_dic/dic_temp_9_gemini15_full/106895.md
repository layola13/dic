laccolite:/ˈlækəlaɪt/| n. |岩盆，岩盖 |A laccolite is a sheet intrusion (a concordant pluton) that has been injected between two layers of sedimentary rock.  The magma, being less dense than the surrounding rock, forces the overlying strata upward, creating a dome-shaped structure.  Laccoliths are relatively small, ranging from a few meters to several kilometers in diameter. |The laccolite forced the overlying layers of sedimentary rock into a dome shape.  岩盆迫使上覆的沉积岩层形成穹顶状。|  pluton, sill, dike |fault, fold |


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The laccolite pushes the overlying strata upward. = 岩盆向上推挤上覆的地层。
Laccoliths are formed by the intrusion of magma. = 岩盆是由岩浆侵入形成的。


一般过去时:
The geologists studied the laccolite's formation. = 地质学家研究了岩盆的形成。
A large laccolite was discovered in the region. = 在该地区发现了一个大型岩盆。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified many laccoliths around the world. = 科学家们已经在世界各地发现了许多岩盆。
Geologists have mapped the extent of the laccolite. = 地质学家绘制了岩盆的范围图。


过去完成时:
Before the erosion, the laccolite was completely buried. = 在侵蚀之前，岩盆完全被埋藏。
The magma had already solidified before the uplift occurred. = 在隆起发生之前，岩浆已经凝固。


将来时:
Researchers will analyze the composition of the laccolite. = 研究人员将分析岩盆的成分。
Further studies will reveal more about the laccolite's age. = 进一步的研究将揭示更多关于岩盆年龄的信息。


虚拟语气:
If the magma had been less viscous, the laccolite would be different. = 如果岩浆粘度更低，岩盆就会有所不同。
It is likely that more laccoliths would have been discovered if more research had been conducted. = 如果进行了更多研究，很可能会有更多岩盆被发现。


被动语态:
The laccolite's structure was studied extensively. = 岩盆的结构被广泛研究。
The age of the laccolite is being determined through radiometric dating. = 岩盆的年龄正在通过放射性测年法确定。


疑问句:
What is the size of the laccolite? = 岩盆有多大？
What type of rock makes up the laccolite? = 岩盆是由什么类型的岩石组成的？


否定句:
The intrusion is not a laccolite; it's a sill. = 这次侵入不是岩盆；它是一个岩床。
That formation is not a typical laccolite. = 那种地层不是典型的岩盆。


PHRASE->
formation of laccolite = 岩盆的形成
types of laccolite = 岩盆的类型
structure of laccolite = 岩盆的结构
size of laccolite = 岩盆的大小
composition of laccolite = 岩盆的成分
