humicubation:/ˌhjuːmɪˈkeɪʃən/| n. |腐殖质化作用；堆肥化作用|The process by which organic matter is decomposed and transformed into humus in soil.  It involves the breakdown of complex organic molecules into simpler ones by microorganisms. |Example: The humicubation of the compost pile was slow due to the lack of moisture.  堆肥堆的腐殖质化作用由于缺乏水分而缓慢。|近义词：composting, decomposition|反义词：暂无
