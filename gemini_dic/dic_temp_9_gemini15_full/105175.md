The word "kex" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  Please double-check your spelling.
* **A dialect word:** It might be a regional or archaic term not widely used.  If you encountered it in a specific context (book, conversation, etc.), providing that context would help.
* **A proper noun:**  It could be a name or a place name.
* **A neologism:** It might be a newly coined word not yet included in dictionaries.

To provide the analysis you requested, I need a correctly spelled word or more information about its context.
