词源:  From Old French *esplorator, from Latin explorātōr, from explorāre "to explore," from ex- "out" + plōrāre "to cry out," "to search," from plōrāre "to weep" (originally, perhaps referring to the cries of scouts).  The modern sense developed from the original meaning of "to scout out" or "to investigate thoroughly."
