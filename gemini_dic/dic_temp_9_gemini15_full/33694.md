* **A neologism or technical term:**  It might be a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field (e.g., jargon). If this is the case, please provide the context in which you encountered it.
* **A proper noun:** It could potentially be a proper noun (like a place name or a person's name).  Again, context would be helpful.
