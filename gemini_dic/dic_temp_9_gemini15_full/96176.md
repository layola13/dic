词源:

The word "indescribablenesses" is formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to the adjective "indescribable."

* **-nesses:** This suffix forms a plural noun from an adjective, indicating multiple instances of the quality described by the adjective.

* **indescribable:** This adjective is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "describable," which itself is formed from the verb "describe" and the suffix "-able" (meaning "capable of being").

Therefore, "indescribablenesses" literally means "the multiple instances of qualities that cannot be described."
