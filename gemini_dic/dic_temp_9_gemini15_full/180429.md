词源:
The word "regalvanization" is derived from "galvanize," which itself comes from the name of Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), an Italian physician and physicist known for his experiments on animal electricity.  "Galvanize" originally meant to stimulate with electric current.  The meaning broadened to include stimulating or revitalizing in a more general sense.  The prefix "re-" adds the meaning of "again" or "anew," thus creating "regalvanization."
