Expertise comes from the French word "expertis," meaning "skilled," or "expert opinion".  It ultimately derives from the Latin "expertus," the past participle of "experiri," meaning "to try," "to test," or "to experience".  This reflects the idea that expertise comes from extensive experience and testing in a given field.
