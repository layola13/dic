词源:
The term "fossil-fueled" is a compound word.  "Fossil" derives from the Latin word "fossilis," meaning "dug up."  It refers to fuels derived from the remains of ancient plants and animals.  "Fueled" is the past participle of the verb "to fuel," meaning "to supply with fuel."  Therefore, "fossil-fueled" literally means "supplied with fuel from dug-up remains of ancient organisms".
