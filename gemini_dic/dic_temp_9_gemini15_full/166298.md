词源:

The word "preredeeming" is formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") with the present participle "redeeming" (from the verb "redeem," meaning to buy back or reclaim).  Therefore, "preredeeming" literally means "buying back or reclaiming before."  The root "redeem" traces back to Old English *ge-lēosan ("to free, deliver," from *lēosan "to loosen").
