/dʒiːtiːsiː/|/ɡiːtiːsiː/|abbr.|GTC|基因型组织相容性|Genotype Tissue Compatibility,  referring to the compatibility of tissues based on their genetic makeup.  It's often used in the context of organ transplantation to ensure the recipient's immune system won't reject the donated organ.|例句：The patient's GTC was carefully checked before the transplant.  移植前，仔细检查了病人的基因型组织相容性。|例句：Achieving good GTC is crucial for successful organ transplantation. 成功的器官移植，获得良好的基因型组织相容性至关重要。|近义词：HLA matching (Human Leukocyte Antigen matching)|反义词：无
