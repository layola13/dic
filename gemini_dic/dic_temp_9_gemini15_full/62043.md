词源:  The word "encampment" comes from the verb "encamp," which itself is formed from the prefix "en-" (meaning "in" or "into") and the word "camp."  "Camp" ultimately derives from the Latin word "campus," meaning "field" or "plain," reflecting the open space typically associated with temporary settlements.
