词源:
The word "network" comes from the Old English word "netweorc,"  a combination of "net" (meaning "net") and "weorc" (meaning "work"). This reflects the original sense of a network as a woven structure, much like a fishing net. Over time, the meaning expanded to encompass any interconnected system.
