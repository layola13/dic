近义词：inspection, examination, scrutiny, reprimand, scolding, dressing-down


反义词：praise, commendation


词源:  The word is a compound of "going" (present participle of "go") and "over" (preposition/adverb).  The original meaning likely referred to a thorough review or inspection, as if something were being "gone over" meticulously. The sense of a severe reprimand developed later, likely because such reprimands often involved a thorough and detailed account of the misdeeds.
