embolismatical: /ˌɛmbɒlɪˈsmætɪkəl/ | adj. | 象征性的；暗喻的 |  The word "embolismatical" is rarely used and is considered archaic or obsolete. It means suggestive of or representing something else, typically something abstract or intangible, in a symbolic or metaphorical way.  It emphasizes the indirect and suggestive nature of the representation.  The word is derived from "embolism," which originally referred to something inserted or intercalated, and "-ical," indicating an adjective. The connection lies in the idea of something inserted to represent something else.  Due to its infrequent use, there are limited examples in modern literature.  It's best to use more common synonyms to convey the meaning.
