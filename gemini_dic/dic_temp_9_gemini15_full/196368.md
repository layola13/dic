词源:

The word "sermocinator" is derived from the Late Latin word *sermocinator*, which itself comes from the verb *sermocinari*, meaning "to converse," "to talk," or "to preach."  The suffix "-ator" indicates an agent or doer of the action. Therefore, a sermocinator is literally someone who engages in conversation, particularly in a formal or public setting like a sermon.
