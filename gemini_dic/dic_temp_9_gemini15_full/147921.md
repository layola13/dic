overrelax: /ˌoʊvərɪˈlæks/ | vt. |过度放松；过度松弛|To relax or loosen to an excessive degree.  This typically refers to a process or system, not a physical body. For example, in numerical methods, overrelaxation refers to accelerating the convergence of an iterative process by exceeding the optimal relaxation factor.|例句：Overrelaxing the iterative process can lead to instability.  过度放松迭代过程可能导致不稳定。|近义词：over-loosen, hyperrelax|反义词：underrelax, tighten
