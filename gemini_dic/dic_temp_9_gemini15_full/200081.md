词源:  The word "skewer" comes from the Old French word "esquivier," meaning "to avoid" or "to shun." It's believed the culinary meaning developed later, possibly from the action of "avoiding" the need to handle individual pieces of meat while grilling.  The modern spelling and usage solidified over time.
