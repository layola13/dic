词源:

The word "marginalizing" comes from the adjective "marginal," meaning "of or relating to a margin,"  which in turn derives from the Latin word "margo," meaning "edge, border, brink." The suffix "-izing" indicates the act of making something marginal.  Thus, "marginalizing" signifies the act of pushing something or someone to the edge, making them unimportant or insignificant.
