ostracoid:/ˈɒstrəkɔɪd/ | n. |介形类动物；介形类化石 | A small bivalved crustacean, especially a fossil one. Ostracods are small, aquatic crustaceans with a hard, bivalved shell. They are found in a wide range of environments, from freshwater lakes and ponds to marine environments.  Fossil ostracods are important in biostratigraphy, as they are abundant and have a relatively short geological lifespan. | Example: The sediment sample contained numerous ostracoid remains, indicating a freshwater environment.  介形虫的残骸数量众多，表明这是一个淡水环境。 |近义词：crustacean, bivalve |反义词：无
