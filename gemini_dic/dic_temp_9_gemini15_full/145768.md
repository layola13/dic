词源:  The word "overcurious" is a compound word formed from the prefix "over-" meaning "too much" or "excessively" and the adjective "curious," meaning "eager to learn or know." "Curious" itself originates from the Latin word "curiosus," meaning "careful," "attentive," or "inquisitive."  Therefore, "overcurious" literally means "excessively curious."
