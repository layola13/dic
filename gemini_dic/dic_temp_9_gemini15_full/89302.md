homoeostasis:/ˌhoʊmiəˈsteɪsɪs/| n. |体内平衡；稳态 |The biological process by which organisms maintain a relatively stable internal environment despite external changes.  It involves a complex interplay of physiological mechanisms that regulate various parameters such as temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose levels.  Maintaining homeostasis is essential for survival and proper functioning of the organism. |The body maintains homeostasis through various feedback mechanisms.  = 人体通过各种反馈机制维持体内平衡。|  Equilibrium, stability, balance | Disequilibrium, instability, imbalance | 名词
