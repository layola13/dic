rhotics:/ˈroʊtɪks/ | n. | 浊音r | The pronunciation of /r/ sounds in certain positions, particularly after vowels.  Rhotics refer to the dialects or languages where the /r/ sound is pronounced in these positions, unlike non-rhotic dialects where it is often dropped or weakened. | Example:  In rhotic dialects, "car" and "card" are pronounced with a clear /r/ sound after the vowel. In non-rhotic dialects, the /r/ might be dropped or only slightly pronounced. | 近义词:  r-coloring, r-ful speech | 反义词: non-rhotics
