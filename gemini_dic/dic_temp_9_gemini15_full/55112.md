The word "disrulily" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries like Merriam-Webster, Oxford English Dictionary, or Cambridge Dictionary.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word not yet accepted into common usage.
