词源：

* **self-**:  prefix meaning "of or relating to oneself"
* **importantly**: adverbial form of "important," derived from Old French "important," ultimately from Latin "importans," present participle of "importare" (to import, bring in).  The sense of "significant" developed later.  The "-ly" suffix creates the adverbial form.


用法说明：

self-importantly is an adverb, modifying a verb to describe how an action is performed. It indicates a manner characterized by excessive self-importance and a lack of consideration for others.  It suggests arrogance, conceit, and a tendency to overestimate one's own significance.
