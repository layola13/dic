The word "eaas" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible it's:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or looking word?
* **An acronym or abbreviation:**  If it's an acronym, please provide context to understand its meaning.
* **A technical term:**  It might be specific to a certain field (e.g., engineering, medicine).  If so, specifying the field would help.
* **A newly coined word or slang:**  It might be a very recent addition to the language not yet in dictionaries.


Without further information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  Please clarify the word or provide more context.
