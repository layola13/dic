词源:

The word "phalanx" comes from the Ancient Greek word φάλαγξ (phalanx), referring to a military formation of heavily armed infantrymen.  This ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *pel-, meaning "to strike" or "to push."  The connection lies in the pushing and striking force of a tightly packed phalanx.
