词源：The word "cadger" ultimately derives from an older word "cadge," which itself has uncertain origins.  Some etymologists suggest a connection to the Old French word "cager," meaning "to cage" or "to confine," possibly implying the sense of being trapped in a life of begging. Another theory points to a possible connection to the Romani word "cadjo," meaning "a bundle" or "a load," referring to the burdens carried by beggars.  The evolution of the word likely reflects the social perceptions of those who rely on begging or other forms of soliciting.
