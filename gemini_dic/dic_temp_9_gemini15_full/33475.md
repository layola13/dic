chylification:/ˌkɪlɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/| n. |乳糜化；乳糜形成|The process by which food is converted into chyle in the small intestine.  This involves the breakdown of fats into fatty acids and glycerol, which then combine with lymph to form chyle. |例句：The process of chylification is crucial for the absorption of dietary fats. 乳糜化过程对于膳食脂肪的吸收至关重要。|例句：Poor digestion can impair chylification, leading to nutrient deficiencies. 消化不良会损害乳糜化，导致营养缺乏。|近义词：emulsification (partially)|反义词：N/A
