词源:
The word "fluster" is of uncertain origin.  It may be related to the Middle Dutch word "flusteren," meaning "to whisper," suggesting a connection to the nervous, agitated state often associated with being flustered.  Another possibility links it to the Old French word "floustre," meaning "a confused jumble."  The exact etymology remains debated.
