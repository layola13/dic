词源:  The word "mantelshelf" is a compound word. "Mantel" comes from the Old French word "mantel," meaning "cloak" or "mantle," referring to the decorative covering or facing of a fireplace. "Shelf" is of Old English origin, from "scylf," meaning a "shelf" or "ledge."  Therefore, "mantelshelf" literally means "shelf above the mantelpiece."
