词源：
The name "Platypod" is a blend of "platy" (referencing the flat, pancake-like design) and "pod" (referencing its compact and self-contained nature).  The word "platy" comes from the Greek word "platys," meaning "flat" or "broad."  The word "pod" has its roots in Middle English and ultimately from Old English.
