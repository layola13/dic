carboxylic:/ˌkɑːrˌbɒksɪlɪk/ /ˌkɑːrˌbɑːksɪlɪk/ | adj. |羧基的，羧酸的 | Relating to or denoting the univalent group -COOH, characteristic of carboxylic acids.  Carboxylic acids are organic acids containing a carboxyl group (-COOH). This group consists of a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single-bonded to a hydroxyl group.  They are a common class of organic compounds with diverse applications. | Example:  Acetic acid is a carboxylic acid. 醋酸是一种羧酸。 The carboxylic functional group is responsible for the acidity of these compounds. 羧基官能团是这些化合物酸性的原因。|近义词：acidic (in the context of carboxylic acids)|反义词：N/A
