词源:

The word "overcomplacency" is a combination of "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessive") and "complacency."  "Complacency" itself comes from the Old French word "complaisance," meaning "pleasure," "complaisance," which ultimately derives from the Latin "complacēre," meaning "to please."  The addition of "over-" emphasizes the excessive or detrimental nature of the complacency.
