osmosis:/ɒzˈməʊsɪs/| n. |渗透；渗透作用 |The process by which molecules of a solvent tend to pass through a semipermeable membrane from a less concentrated solution into a more concentrated one, thus equalizing the concentrations on each side of the membrane.  |Example: Water moves into the roots of plants by osmosis. 水通过渗透作用进入植物的根部。|近义词：diffusion, permeation |反义词：active transport


USAGE->
