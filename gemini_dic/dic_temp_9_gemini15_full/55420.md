词源:
The word "distilled" comes from the Middle English word "distillen," which itself is derived from the Old French word "destiller," ultimately originating from the Latin word "destillare," meaning "to drip down" or "to fall drop by drop."  The Latin word is a combination of "de-" (down) and "stillare" (to drip).  The process of distillation involves the controlled heating and cooling of a liquid, causing it to vaporize and then recondense, leaving impurities behind.
