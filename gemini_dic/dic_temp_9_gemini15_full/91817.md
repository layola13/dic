词源:
The word "hyperfunctionally" is derived from the prefix "hyper-" (meaning "above," "beyond," or "excessive"), the noun "function" (referring to the action or purpose of something), and the adverbial suffix "-ally" (indicating manner or condition).  Therefore, it literally describes something functioning beyond its normal capacity or in an excessive manner.
