词源:

The word "rubedinous" comes from the Latin word "rubeus," meaning "red." The suffix "-dinous" indicates a state or quality.  Therefore, the word literally means "having the quality of being red," but its usage has evolved to describe a specific kind of reddish complexion often associated with plumpness.
