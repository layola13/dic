词源:

The word "nondigestions" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the noun "digestions" (the process of digesting food).  "Digestions" itself derives from the verb "digest," which comes from the Latin word "digerere," meaning "to distribute," "to arrange," or "to dissolve."  The original Latin sense evolved to encompass the biological process of breaking down food.
