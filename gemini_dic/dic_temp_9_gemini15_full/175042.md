radioheliograph:/ˌreɪdiəʊˈhiːliəɡræf/| n. |射电日像仪|A radioheliograph is a complex instrument used in radio astronomy to create images of the Sun by detecting and analyzing radio waves emitted from it.  It typically consists of an array of radio antennas that work together to achieve high angular resolution. This allows scientists to study solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and other solar phenomena with great detail.| The radioheliograph at Culgoora Observatory in Australia provided groundbreaking images of solar activity.  The new radioheliograph will provide higher resolution images than its predecessor.|近义词：radio telescope (but with emphasis on solar imaging)|反义词：无|名词
