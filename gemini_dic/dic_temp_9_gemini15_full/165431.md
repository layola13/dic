prelawfulnesses:/ˌpriːˈlɔːfʊlnəsɪz/ | n. |预先合法性；预先法律规定（该词并非标准英语词汇，可能为罕见或错误拼写）|This word is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling. It seems to be attempting to combine "pre-" (meaning before) and "lawfulness" (the state of being lawful).  Therefore, a potential meaning could be "the state of being lawful beforehand" or "prior legal stipulations." However, without further context, its meaning is unclear and its usage is highly questionable.  There are no standard dictionaries that include this word. |No example sentence can be provided as this is not a standard word. |近义词： (depending on intended meaning) prior legality, antecedent lawfulness, pre-existing legal framework |反义词： (depending on intended meaning) illegality, lawlessness, pre-existing illegality |名词
