词源:  From Middle English *recumbencie, from Old French *recumbence, from Latin recumbentia, from the present participle of recumbere "to lie down," from re- "back, again" +  cumbere "to lie down," of uncertain origin, possibly related to Greek kome "sleep."  The word's evolution reflects its meaning shift from simply lying down to also encompassing the idea of yielding or submission.
