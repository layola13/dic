The word "meler" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name or a place name.
* **It's a word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely used in English.
* **It's a neologism:** It might be a newly coined word not yet accepted into common usage.


Please provide the correct spelling or more context, and I will be happy to help.
