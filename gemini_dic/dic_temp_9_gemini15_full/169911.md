Prosperity comes from the Old French *prosperité*, from Latin *prosperitas*, from *prosperus* ("successful, fortunate"), from *prospere* ("successfully, favorably"), from *pro* ("forward") + *sperare* ("to hope").  The root meaning suggests a state of advancement or success fueled by hope and favorable circumstances.
