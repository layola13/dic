USAGE->
This word is primarily used in zoology and comparative anatomy, so verb conjugations are not directly applicable in the same way as with common verbs.  The word itself describes a structure, not an action.  Therefore, tenses and other verb-related grammatical concepts don't directly apply to "neuropodium".  Instead, we'll look at how it's used in descriptive sentences.
