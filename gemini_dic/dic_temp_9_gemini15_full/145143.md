词源:  The word "overassertion" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the noun "assertion," which comes from the verb "assert" (to state a fact or belief confidently and forcefully).  The root of "assert" can be traced back to the Latin verb "asserere," meaning "to claim," "to affirm," or "to declare."
