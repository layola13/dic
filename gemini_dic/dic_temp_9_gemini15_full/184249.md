词源:
The word "resolver" comes from the verb "resolve," meaning "to find a solution to," or "to separate into components."  The suffix "-er" indicates an agent or instrument.  The root of "resolve" can be traced back to the Latin word "resolvere," which is a combination of "re-" (again) and "solvere" (to loosen, to untie).  Therefore, the core meaning reflects the act of untying or separating something complex into simpler parts, ultimately leading to a solution.
