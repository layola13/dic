The word "proller" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  Perhaps a word related to "propeller," "roller," or another similar-sounding term?  Providing context where you encountered this word would be helpful.

2. **It's a neologism or technical term:** It might be a newly coined word, a slang term, or a word specific to a particular field or dialect.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name (of a person, place, or thing).

Without more information, I cannot provide a detailed analysis as requested in the format.  Please clarify the word or provide the context in which you saw it.
