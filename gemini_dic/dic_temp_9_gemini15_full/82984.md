gunnel's: /ˈɡʌnəl/ | n. | 船舷；(鱼类) 细条鱼 | The gunnel's of the boat were worn from years of use. | 近义词：side, edge, gunwale | 反义词：center, middle


英文解析：

Gunnel, in its most common nautical usage, refers to the upper edge of a vessel's side, between the deck and the hull.  It's often used interchangeably with "gunwale," though some sources suggest a subtle difference, with "gunnel" perhaps referring more specifically to the entire upper edge of the hull while "gunwale" refers to the topmost plank or beam.  In ichthyology (the study of fish), "gunnel" refers to a type of small, slender fish, often found in coastal waters.


例句：

The fisherman carefully balanced himself on the gunnel of his small boat.  = 渔夫小心翼翼地平衡着自己，站在他小船的船舷上。

The old ship's gunnels were heavily encrusted with barnacles. = 这艘老船的船舷上长满了厚厚的藤壶。


词源:

The word "gunnel" ultimately derives from Old Norse *gunnr, meaning "edge" or "rim."  Its nautical usage reflects its connection to the edge of a boat.  The ichthyological usage is likely a later development, possibly due to the slender, elongated shape of the fish resembling the narrow edge of a boat.


用法说明：

Gunnel is primarily a noun. It’s not commonly used as a verb or adjective.  The possessive form 'gunnel's' is used to show ownership or possession, as in "the gunnel's edge" (the edge of the gunnel).
