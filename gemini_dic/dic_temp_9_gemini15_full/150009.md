The word "palmol" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis following your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (like a brand name), or a word from a very specialized field.

To help, I need more context. Where did you encounter this word? Knowing its source might help determine its meaning and allow for a proper analysis.
