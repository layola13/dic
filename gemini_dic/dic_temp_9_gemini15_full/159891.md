polymorphosis:/ˌpɒliˈmɔːrfəʊsɪs/| n. |多形性，多态性 |The ability of a single genotype to produce multiple phenotypes depending on environmental conditions.  This is common in many organisms, allowing them to adapt to changing circumstances. For example, some bacteria exhibit polymorphosis, changing their shape and behavior in response to nutrient availability.  |例句：The polymorphosis of this species allows it to thrive in diverse habitats.  = 该物种的多形性使其能够在不同的栖息地繁荣生长。

The polymorphosis observed in the insect larvae is a fascinating example of adaptive evolution. = 在昆虫幼虫中观察到的多形性是适应性进化的一个引人入胜的例子。

PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "polymorphosis."  Its usage is primarily within scientific contexts. However, related phrases might include:


phenotypic plasticity: 表型可塑性 (describes the underlying mechanism often responsible for polymorphosis)
environmental influence: 环境影响 (a key factor determining polymorphosis)
adaptive strategy: 适应策略 (polymorphosis is often an example of this)
developmental plasticity: 发育可塑性 (closely related concept)
genetic variation: 基因变异 (contributes to the potential for polymorphosis)



词源:
The word "polymorphosis" comes from the Greek words:

* **poly-:** meaning "many" or "much"
* **morph-:** meaning "form" or "shape"
* **-osis:** a suffix indicating a process or condition

Therefore, "polymorphosis" literally means "the condition of having many forms."
