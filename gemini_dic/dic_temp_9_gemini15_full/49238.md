The word "deler" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Providing the context where you encountered this word would be helpful.

2. **It's a neologism or technical term:** It might be a newly coined word, a slang term, or specific to a particular field (e.g., a technical term in a specific industry).  More information is needed to determine its meaning and usage.

3. **It's a word from another language:**  It could be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.  If you can provide the language of origin, it may be possible to find a translation and explanation.


Without further information, I cannot provide the requested analysis. Please clarify the word or provide more context.
