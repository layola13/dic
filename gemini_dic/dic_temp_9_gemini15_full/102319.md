英文解析：An ivory tower is a metaphorical term referring to a state of seclusion or detachment from the realities of everyday life. It often implies a place of intellectual or artistic pursuits, but one that is sheltered from the practical concerns and problems of the outside world.  The term often carries a slightly negative connotation, suggesting a lack of awareness or concern for the real world and its problems.

词源：The term originates from the fairy tale "Rapunzel," where Rapunzel is imprisoned in a tower.  The association with ivory likely comes from the image of a beautiful, elegant, and somewhat inaccessible structure.  The use of "ivory" adds to the sense of luxury and detachment from the mundane.
