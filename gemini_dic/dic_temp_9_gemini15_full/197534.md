英文解析:  Suffering from shell shock; deeply shocked and traumatized, typically as a result of a terrifying experience.  The term originally referred to a type of psychological trauma experienced by soldiers during wartime, characterized by symptoms such as anxiety, depression, and flashbacks.  Now, it's used more broadly to describe anyone who is deeply affected by a shocking or traumatic event.

词源:  The term originated during World War I to describe the psychological effects of prolonged exposure to artillery shelling on soldiers.
