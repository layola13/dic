emulsin:/ˈɛmʌlsɪn/| n.|苦杏仁苷酶|A group of β-glycosidases that catalyze the hydrolysis of β-glycosides, particularly those found in plants like almonds and other seeds. Emulsin is a complex mixture of enzymes, not a single enzyme. It's known for its ability to break down amygdalin, a cyanogenic glycoside, into glucose, benzaldehyde, and hydrogen cyanide.  The presence of emulsin in almonds and other seeds is a significant factor in their toxicity if consumed improperly.|Example: The presence of emulsin in bitter almonds makes them potentially poisonous unless properly processed.|近义词:β-glycosidase|反义词:|无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Emulsin breaks down amygdalin. = 苦杏仁苷酶分解苦杏仁苷。
The enzyme hydrolyzes beta-glycosides. = 这种酶水解β-糖苷。


一般过去时:
Emulsin broke down the amygdalin in the almonds. = 苦杏仁苷酶分解了杏仁中的苦杏仁苷。
Scientists identified the emulsin activity in the plant extract. = 科学家在植物提取物中发现了苦杏仁苷酶活性。
