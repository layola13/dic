genotypically:/ˌdʒiːnoʊˈtɪpɪkli/ | adj. | 基因型地，从基因型角度 |  Describing something based on its genotype, the genetic constitution of an organism.  It refers to the inherent genetic makeup rather than the observable characteristics. | Example: Genotypically, the plants were identical, even though they displayed different phenotypes due to environmental factors.  基因型上，这些植物是相同的，尽管由于环境因素它们表现出不同的表型。|近义词：genetically | 反义词：phenotypically
