词源:
The word "nonideological" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "ideological," which is derived from "ideology."  "Ideology" comes from the French word "idéologie," coined by Destutt de Tracy in the late 18th century, combining "idée" (idea) and "-logie" (the study of). Thus, "nonideological" literally means "not relating to the study of ideas," especially in the context of political or social systems.
