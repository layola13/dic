The word "ental" does not exist as a standalone word in standard English.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  It might be a misspelling, a part of a larger word, or a technical term from a specific field.  More context is needed to understand its intended meaning.
