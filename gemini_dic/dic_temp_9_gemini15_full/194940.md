semi-logarithmic:/ˌsɛmiˌlɒɡəˈrɪðmɪk/| adj. |半对数的，半对数坐标的|  Describes a graph or scale where one axis is scaled logarithmically and the other is scaled linearly. This type of graph is useful for visualizing data with a wide range of values, where a linear scale would make small values difficult to see, while a logarithmic scale on both axes might obscure the relationship between values.  | Example: A semi-logarithmic plot is often used to display exponential growth or decay.  半对数图常用于显示指数增长或衰减。|近义词：log-linear|反义词：linear (fully logarithmic)|词性:形容词

Word Origin:

The word is a combination of:
