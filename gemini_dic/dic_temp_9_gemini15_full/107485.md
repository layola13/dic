lancelet: /ˈlænslət/ | n. | 文昌鱼 | A small, fish-like invertebrate chordate that is considered a primitive type of chordate,  lacking a well-developed brain and possessing a notochord throughout its life.  Lancelets are important in evolutionary biology because they share characteristics with both invertebrates and vertebrates, providing insights into the evolutionary transition between them. | Example: The lancelet's simple structure provides valuable clues to the early evolution of vertebrates.  文昌鱼的简单结构为早期脊椎动物的进化提供了宝贵的线索。| 近义词: amphioxus (a synonym)| 反义词: N/A
