词源：

The word "communicative" derives from the Latin word "communicare," meaning "to share," "to make common," or "to impart."  This root also gives rise to words like "communicate," "community," and "common."  The suffix "-ative"  is added to create the adjectival form, indicating a tendency or capacity for communication.
