The word "nabit" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a slang term from a specific region or community, or a word from another language.

To provide a helpful response, please clarify:

1. **Source:** Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the context (book, conversation, website, etc.) will help determine its meaning and origin.
2. **Intended Spelling:**  Is it possible you misspelled a similar-sounding word?  If you can provide any alternative spellings or the surrounding text, that would be very useful.

Once you provide this information, I can attempt a more accurate analysis.
