词源:  The word "nobilitas" comes from the Late Latin word, ultimately deriving from the Latin adjective "nobilis," meaning "well-known," "famous," or "distinguished."  "Nobilis" itself is related to the Latin verb "noscere," meaning "to know."  Thus, the original sense implied being known and recognized for something positive, leading to the association with high social standing and moral virtue.
