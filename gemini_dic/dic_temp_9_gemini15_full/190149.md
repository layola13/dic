词源:
The word "sanitization" is derived from the word "sanitize," which itself comes from the Latin word "sanitas," meaning "health" or "wholesomeness."  The suffix "-ization" indicates the process of making something.  Therefore, sanitization literally means the process of making something healthy or wholesome, typically by cleaning and disinfecting.
