词源:
The word "like" has Old English roots, stemming from the word "lic," meaning "body," "shape," or "form."  Its evolution into a verb expressing preference and a preposition indicating similarity reflects a broadening of meaning over centuries.  The modern usages as a verb, preposition, adjective, and noun all derive from this core meaning of resemblance or similarity.
