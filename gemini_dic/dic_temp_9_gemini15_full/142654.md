词源:
The word "ostracize" comes from the Ancient Greek word "ὀστρακισμός" (ostrakismos), which literally means "potsherd," referring to the ancient Athenian practice of ostracism.  In ancient Athens, citizens could vote to banish someone from the city-state for a period of ten years by writing their name on a potsherd (a broken piece of pottery).  The word entered English in the 17th century.
