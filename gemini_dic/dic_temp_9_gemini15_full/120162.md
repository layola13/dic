WORD ORIGIN->
The word is formed by combining "mind-boggling," an adjective meaning "astonishingly complex or confusing," with the adverbial suffix "-ly."  "Mind-boggling" itself combines "mind," referring to the intellect or understanding, with "boggling,"  from the verb "to boggle," meaning to overwhelm or amaze to the point of bewilderment.  The original sense of "boggle" is related to the idea of something being so strange or unexpected as to cause the eyes to bulge or "boggle."
