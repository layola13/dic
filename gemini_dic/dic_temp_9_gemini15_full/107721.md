The word "lanyer" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It is possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a proper noun:  Is it a name, place, or brand?
* It's a neologism or slang:  Is it a newly coined word or part of a specific jargon?
