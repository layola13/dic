词源:
The word "report" comes from the Old French word "reporter," meaning "to bring back," "to carry back," or "to return."  This is ultimately derived from the Latin word "re-," meaning "again," and "portare," meaning "to carry."  The sense of bringing back information or news evolved from the literal meaning of carrying something back.
