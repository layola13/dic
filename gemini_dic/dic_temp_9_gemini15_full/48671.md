词源:  The word "deference" comes from the Old French word "deferençe," meaning "yielding," "compliance," or "submission." This, in turn, derives from the Latin verb "deferre," meaning "to carry away," "to put off," or "to yield."  The Latin root suggests a yielding or carrying away of one's own will or judgment in favor of another.
