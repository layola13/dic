近义词：unidentifiabilities, indistinguishabilities | 反义词：clarity, distinguishability


词源:

* **indiscernible:**  This is the root word. It comes from the prefix "in-" (not), "dis-" (apart), "cern-" (to separate, distinguish) + "-ible" (capable of).  Therefore, "indiscernible" means "not able to be separated or distinguished."

* **-ness:** This suffix is added to adjectives to form nouns, indicating a state, quality, or condition.  Thus, "indiscernibleness" means "the state of being indiscernible."

* **-es:** This is the plural suffix, indicating more than one instance of indiscernibleness.


用法说明:

This word is extremely rare and unlikely to be encountered in everyday conversation or writing. Its use is almost exclusively confined to highly specialized or academic contexts where the need to describe multiple instances of indistinguishability is paramount.  It is a very formal and cumbersome word; simpler alternatives usually exist.  Consider using phrases like "multiple instances of indistinguishability," or simply "indistinguishable things," depending on the context.  There is no specific grammatical usage unique to this word beyond standard noun usage.  Therefore, tense and other grammatical categories as presented in the example are not applicable to this word specifically.  It's a noun and functions like any other noun.
