PHRASE->
(There are no common phrases directly using "quasi-fascinatingly" as it's a newly coined adverb.  Phrases would be built around it.)
Example phrases could be:
quasi-fascinatingly detailed, quasi-fascinatingly explained, quasi-fascinatingly narrated, quasi-fascinatingly presented, quasi-fascinatingly described.

词源:
The word is a combination of:

* **quasi-:**  A prefix of Latin origin meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent."
* **fascinatingly:** An adverb derived from "fascinate," ultimately from Latin "fascinare" (to bewitch, enchant).  "-ingly" is an adverbial suffix.

Therefore, "quasi-fascinatingly" describes something that is *almost* or *partially* fascinating, not entirely so.
