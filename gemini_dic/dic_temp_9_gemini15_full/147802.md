/ˈoʊvərˈpruːvən/ | adj. | 被过度证明的；证据过多的 |  This word is not a standard English word. It's a nonce word, meaning it's created for a specific occasion and not found in dictionaries.  It combines "over" (meaning excessively) and "proven" (past participle of "prove").  It implies that something has been proven to an excessive degree, perhaps to the point of being unconvincing or redundant.  There are no standard usage examples, synonyms, or antonyms because it's not a legitimate lexical entry.  The meaning is entirely contextual.  To use it correctly, one would need to define its meaning within the context of the sentence it is used in.


USAGE->
This word lacks standard grammatical usage as it's not a recognized word.  Examples would need to be constructed based on intended meaning in a specific context.  For instance, one might say:

* "His guilt felt overproven; the mountain of evidence was overwhelming but somehow lacked conviction." = 他的罪行感觉被过度证明了；大量的证据令人难以置信，但却不知何故缺乏说服力。


PHRASE->
As it is not a standard word, there are no established phrases using "overproven".
