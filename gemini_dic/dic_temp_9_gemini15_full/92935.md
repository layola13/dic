词源:
The word "identify" comes from the Late Middle English word "identifien," which in turn derives from Old French "identifier" (to make identical). The Old French word itself is a combination of "idem" (the same) and "fier" (to make).  Therefore, the word's root meaning is "to make the same" or "to equate."
