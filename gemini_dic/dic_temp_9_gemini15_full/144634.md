The word "outwoe" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested.  It may be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure dialect.
