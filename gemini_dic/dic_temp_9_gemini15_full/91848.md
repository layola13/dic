/ˌhaɪpəhaɪˈpɒkrəsiːz/ | n. |超级虚伪；极度伪善 | The term "hyperhypocrisies" is not a standard English word found in dictionaries.  It's a neologism, likely formed by combining "hyper-" (meaning excessive or above) and "hypocrisy" (the practice of claiming to have virtues, moral or religious beliefs, principles, etc., that one does not actually possess).  Therefore, it describes an extreme or exaggerated form of hypocrisy, perhaps suggesting layers or a particularly insidious type of hypocrisy.  There's no established usage or definition, its meaning depending entirely on context. | Example:  The politician's pronouncements on morality were blatant hyperhypocrisies, given his secret dealings.  政治家的道德宣言是赤裸裸的超级虚伪，鉴于他的秘密交易。|近义词: extreme hypocrisy,  rank hypocrisy,  duplicity,  insincerity | 反义词: sincerity, honesty, genuineness |名词
