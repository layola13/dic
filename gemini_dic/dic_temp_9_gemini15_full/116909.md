词源:
The word "mayonnaise" is derived from the French word *mahonnaise*, which in turn is believed to be named after the city of Mahon in Minorca, an island in the Mediterranean Sea.  During the 18th-century British siege of Mahon, a sauce was created, possibly by accident, that resembled modern mayonnaise.  Its popularity spread, and the name stuck.  The exact origin story remains debated, but the connection to Mahon is widely accepted.
