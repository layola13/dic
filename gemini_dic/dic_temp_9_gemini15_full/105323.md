kiby:/ˈkaɪbi/| n. |千字节 (1024 字节)|A kibibyte (KiB) is a unit of information or computer storage equal to 1024 bytes.  It's often used in computer science to express file sizes and memory capacities.  The term is derived from the binary prefix "kibi" (2^10) and the unit "byte".  Note that it's distinct from kilobyte (kB), which is 1000 bytes.|例句：The file size is approximately 10 KiB.  这个文件大小大约是10千字节。|近义词：KB (kilobyte, although technically different)|反义词：None. |名词

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The file size is 10 KiB. = 文件大小是10千字节。
How many KiB does this program use? = 这个程序使用了多少千字节？


一般过去时:
The document was 5 KiB last week. = 这个文档上周是5千字节。
The download took 2 minutes for a 20 KiB file. = 下载一个20千字节的文件花了2分钟。


现在完成时:
We have transferred 100 KiB of data. = 我们已经传输了100千字节的数据。
The system has processed more than 1 GiB of data, which includes many KiB files. = 系统已经处理了超过1吉字节的数据，其中包括许多千字节的文件。


过去完成时:
The program had already used 50 KiB before the error occurred. = 在错误发生之前，程序已经使用了50千字节。
We had downloaded only 1 KiB when the connection dropped. = 当连接中断时，我们只下载了1千字节。


将来时:
The upload will be approximately 500 KiB. = 上传大约将是500千字节。
This new version will use less KiB than the previous one. = 这个新版本将比之前的版本使用更少的千字节。


虚拟语气:
If the file were only 1 KiB, it would upload quickly. = 如果文件只有1千字节，它会很快上传。
I wish the image was smaller, say, under 10 KiB. = 我希望图像更小，比如说，小于10千字节。


被动语态:
5 KiB of memory was allocated to the process. = 5千字节的内存被分配给该进程。
A total of 20 KiB is being used by the current application. = 当前应用程序正在使用总共20千字节。


疑问句:
How many KiB are left on the hard drive? = 硬盘上还剩下多少千字节？
What is the size of the file in KiB? = 这个文件的大小是多少千字节？


否定句:
The file is not 10 KiB; it's much smaller. = 文件不是10千字节；它小得多。
This application doesn't use more than 100 KiB of memory. = 这个应用程序不使用超过100千字节的内存。


PHRASE->
1 KiB file = 1千字节的文件
10 KiB image = 10千字节的图像
several KiB of data = 几千字节的数据
hundreds of KiB = 几百千字节
a few KiB = 少量千字节
