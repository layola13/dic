The word "fouty" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Please double-check the spelling.

2. **It's a slang term or regional dialect word:**  If you heard it somewhere, providing the context (where you heard it, who said it) might help determine its meaning.

3. **It's a neologism or newly coined word:**  In this case, more information about its intended meaning and usage is needed.

Without more information, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested in the format.  Please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
