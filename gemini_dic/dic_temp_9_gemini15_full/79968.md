词源:
The phrase "go bad" is a straightforward combination of the verb "go" and the adjective "bad."  "Go" indicates a process or change of state, while "bad" describes the undesirable outcome.  The etymology is thus a simple combination of common Old English roots.  There's no single, more complex origin story.
