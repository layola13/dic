词源:

The word "inseparably" is derived from the adjective "separable," which itself comes from the verb "separate."  The prefix "in-" signifies "not," thus creating the antonym "inseparable," meaning "not able to be separated."  Adding "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb, modifying verbs and describing how an action is performed.  The root word traces back to the Latin "separare," meaning "to separate" or "to sever".
