omnidirectionality:/ˌɒmnɪˌdaɪrɛkʃənˈælɪti/ | n. |全向性，多方向性 | The property of being able to receive or transmit signals or energy in all directions equally.  It describes a system or device that operates without a preferred direction. For example, an omnidirectional antenna can receive signals from any direction equally well. | 例句：The omnidirectionality of the microphone allowed us to record the entire orchestra clearly.  麦克风的全向性使我们能够清晰地录制整个管弦乐队的声音。


The new speaker system boasts improved omnidirectionality, delivering consistent sound quality regardless of listener position. 新的音响系统拥有改进的全向性，无论听众位置如何都能提供一致的音质。|近义词：universality, all-aroundness |反义词：directionality, unidirectionality
