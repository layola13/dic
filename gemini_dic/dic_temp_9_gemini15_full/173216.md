词源:
The word "quasi-comfortable" is a compound word.  "Quasi" is derived from the Latin word "quasi," meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."  "Comfortable" originates from the Old French "confortabler," meaning "to strengthen," "to console," ultimately related to Latin "com-," meaning "together," and "fortis," meaning "strong."  Therefore, "quasi-comfortable" literally means "as if comfortable," or "almost comfortable."
