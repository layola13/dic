词源:
The word "disassembling" comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart" or "reverse") and the verb "assemble" (meaning "to put together").  Therefore, "disassembling" literally means "taking apart."  "Assemble" itself has roots in the Old French "assembler" (to gather together) and ultimately Latin "ad" (to) + "similis" (like, similar). The implication is that things are brought together that are similar or alike.
