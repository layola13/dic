/ˌoʊvərˈɑːnɪstisiz/ | n. | 过分诚实；过度的坦率 |  The word "overhonestnesses" is not a standard word in the English language. It's a rare and unusual formation, combining "overhonest" (itself an uncommon adjective) with the plural "-nesses" to suggest multiple instances of excessive honesty.  It implies a degree of honesty that is excessive, perhaps even inappropriate or detrimental.  There isn't a direct, single-word synonym.  The meaning would need to be conveyed using a phrase. |  The overhonestnesses of the witness ultimately harmed the defendant's case.  = 证人的过分坦诚最终损害了被告的案情。  | excessive frankness, undue candor, too much honesty | dishonesty, deception, dissimulation | n.
