homotypy:/hoʊˈmɒtɪpi/| n. |同型性，同型现象|The similarity in form or structure between different parts of an organism or between different organisms.  It refers to the repetition of similar structures or organs in different parts of an organism.  This is often due to evolutionary processes or developmental constraints.|Example: The repeated segments in an insect's body exhibit homotypy.|近义词：similarity, resemblance, analogy|反义词：heterotypy, dissimilarity


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Homotypy exists in many species. = 许多物种都存在同型性。
The researchers study homotypy in plant development. = 研究人员研究植物发育中的同型性。


一般过去时:
Scientists observed homotypy in the fossil record. = 科学家在化石记录中观察到同型性。
The study described the homotypy of the limbs. = 这项研究描述了肢体的同型性。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several examples of homotypy. = 研究人员已经确定了几个同型性的例子。
Scientists have long been interested in the causes of homotypy. = 科学家长期以来一直对同型性的成因感兴趣。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, little was known about homotypy in that species. = 在发现之前，人们对该物种的同型性知之甚少。
They had already documented similar cases of homotypy in related organisms. = 他们已经在相关生物体中记录了类似的同型性案例。


将来时:
Further research will explore the genetic basis of homotypy. = 进一步的研究将探索同型性的遗传基础。
Scientists will likely find more instances of homotypy as research progresses. = 随着研究的进展，科学家们可能会发现更多同型性的实例。


虚拟语气:
If homotypy were absent, development would be quite different. = 如果没有同型性，发育将会大相径庭。
It is vital that we understand the mechanisms of homotypy. = 我们理解同型性的机制至关重要。


被动语态:
Homotypy has been studied extensively in various fields. = 同型性已在各个领域得到广泛研究。
The developmental pathways of homotypy are being investigated. = 同型性的发育途径正在被研究。


疑问句:
Does homotypy always result from similar genetic mechanisms? = 同型性总是由类似的遗传机制导致的吗？
What are the evolutionary advantages of homotypy? = 同型性的进化优势是什么？


否定句:
Not all similar structures are examples of homotypy. = 并非所有相似的结构都是同型性的例子。
The observed pattern did not demonstrate clear homotypy. = 观察到的模式没有显示出明显的同型性。
