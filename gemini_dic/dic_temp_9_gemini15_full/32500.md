词源：The word "chinless" is a relatively straightforward combination of "chin" and the suffix "-less," which indicates the absence of something.  The original meaning referred to the literal absence of a chin. The figurative meaning developed later, associating a lack of chin with a lack of strength of character.  This likely stems from cultural associations of a strong, prominent chin with masculinity, strength, and determination.
