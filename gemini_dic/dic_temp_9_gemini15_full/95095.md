词源:

The word "inamorata" comes from the Italian "innamorata," meaning "loved one," or "beloved."  It's ultimately derived from the verb "innamorare," meaning "to fall in love."  The suffix "-ata" is a feminine noun suffix in Italian.  The English word adopted the plural form directly from Italian.
