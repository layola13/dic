peridiastole: /ˌpɛriəˈdaɪəstoʊli/ | n. | 心脏舒张期（尤指心室舒张期）| The period of relaxation and dilation of the heart chambers, especially the ventricles, between contractions.  This is the phase where the heart chambers fill with blood before the next contraction. | Example:  The peridiastole is a crucial phase in the cardiac cycle, allowing the heart to refill with oxygenated blood. = 心脏舒张期是心脏周期中至关重要的阶段，使心脏能够重新充满含氧血液。


The electrocardiogram showed a prolonged peridiastole, suggesting a possible cardiac issue. = 心电图显示心脏舒张期延长，提示可能存在心脏问题。|近义词：ventricular diastole, diastole |反义词：systole


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The peridiastole allows the heart to refill with blood. = 心脏舒张期使心脏能够重新充满血液。
A healthy heart maintains a regular peridiastole. = 健康的心脏保持规律的心脏舒张期。

一般过去时:
The peridiastole was prolonged during the patient's illness. = 在病人患病期间，心脏舒张期延长了。
Doctors measured the peridiastole to assess heart function. = 医生测量心脏舒张期以评估心脏功能。

现在完成时:
Research has significantly improved our understanding of peridiastole. = 研究极大地提高了我们对心脏舒张期的理解。
Scientists have studied the effects of various factors on peridiastole. = 科学家们研究了各种因素对心脏舒张期的影响。

过去完成时:
Before the diagnosis, the patient had experienced an abnormally long peridiastole. = 在诊断之前，病人经历了异常长的心脏舒张期。
The doctor had already noted the irregular peridiastole during the initial examination. = 医生在初步检查时就已经注意到不规则的心脏舒张期。

将来时:
Future studies will further investigate the mechanisms of peridiastole. = 未来的研究将进一步研究心脏舒张期的机制。
Improved technology will allow for more precise measurement of peridiastole. = 改进的技术将允许更精确地测量心脏舒张期。

虚拟语气:
If the peridiastole were shorter, the heart would not be able to fill properly. = 如果心脏舒张期较短，心脏将无法充分充盈。
It is important that the peridiastole is not excessively prolonged. = 心脏舒张期不能过长是很重要的。

被动语态:
The peridiastole is often monitored during cardiac stress tests. = 心脏舒张期通常在心脏负荷试验期间进行监测。
The duration of peridiastole was carefully analyzed by the cardiologist. = 心脏舒张期的持续时间由心脏病专家仔细分析。

疑问句:
How long is the peridiastole in a normal heart? = 正常心脏的心脏舒张期有多长？
What factors can affect the duration of peridiastole? = 哪些因素会影响心脏舒张期的持续时间？

否定句:
The patient did not exhibit an abnormal peridiastole. = 病人没有表现出异常的心脏舒张期。
The test results did not indicate any problems with the peridiastole. = 测试结果没有显示心脏舒张期有任何问题。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "peridiastole" as it is a highly technical medical term.  Phrases would relate to its measurement or associated conditions.  Examples that could be constructed might include:


*   prolonged peridiastole
*   abnormal peridiastole
*   measurement of peridiastole
*   effects on peridiastole
*   peridiastole dysfunction


词源:

The word "peridiastole" combines "peri-" (around, near) and "diastole" (dilation, expansion).  "Diastole" itself comes from the Greek word "diastolē," meaning "a drawing apart."  Therefore, "peridiastole" literally refers to the period around or related to the dilation of the heart chambers.
