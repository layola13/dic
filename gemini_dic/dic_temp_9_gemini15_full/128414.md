词源:
The word "newfangled" is a combination of "new" and "fangled".  "Fangled" comes from the Middle English word "fanglen," meaning "to seize, grasp, or take hold of."  Over time, "fangled" evolved to mean "newly invented" or "newly fashioned."  The original sense implies a quick or perhaps superficial adoption of something new.  Therefore, "newfangled" retains a slightly negative undertone, suggesting a novelty that might lack substance or practicality.
