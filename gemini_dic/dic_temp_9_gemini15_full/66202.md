excitabilities:/ˌɛksˌaɪtəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. |兴奋性；激发性；易兴奋性 |The capacity of a system, cell, or tissue to react to a stimulus.  This refers to the responsiveness of a biological system to external or internal stimuli.  It often involves the generation of an electrical signal or a change in metabolic activity.  The level of excitability can vary depending on factors such as the type of tissue, the intensity and duration of the stimulus, and the presence of modifying substances. | Example: The excitabilities of neurons are crucial for nerve impulse transmission. 神经元的兴奋性对于神经冲动传递至关重要。


The excitabilities of the heart muscle cells were significantly altered by the drug.  药物显著改变了心肌细胞的兴奋性。|近义词：responsiveness, irritability, reactivity |反义词：unresponsiveness, inertia, sluggishness

词源:

The word "excitabilities" is derived from the word "excitability," which in turn comes from the verb "excite."  "Excite" originates from the Latin word "excītāre," meaning "to rouse, stir up, or provoke."  The suffix "-ability" denotes the capacity or potential for something. Therefore, "excitabilities" signifies the various capacities or potentials for being excited or roused.
