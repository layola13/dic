词源:
The word "out-dodging" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent" or "surpassing") and the verb "dodging" (meaning "to evade or avoid skillfully").  Therefore, "out-dodging" signifies surpassing someone or something in the skill of evasion or avoidance.  The root of "dodge" is uncertain, but possibly from a Middle English word meaning "to shuffle".
