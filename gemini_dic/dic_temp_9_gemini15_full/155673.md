phloem:/ˈfloʊɛm/| n. |韧皮部|The phloem is the living tissue in vascular plants that transports sugars and other metabolic products.  It is a complex tissue, and its components vary somewhat depending on the plant species. The phloem is part of the vascular system, which also includes the xylem.  Phloem tissue is essential for the plant's survival, as it distributes the energy produced during photosynthesis to other parts of the plant.|The phloem transports sugars from the leaves to the roots and other parts of the plant. |近义词：vascular tissue, bast|反义词：xylem
