This entry follows the requested format but  "latex's" isn't a standard word with a dictionary entry.  It's a possessive form of "latex,"  but it is grammatically incorrect if referring to the typesetting system.  Proper usage would be "LaTeX's" (capital L,  as it's a proper noun) or "the LaTeX commands".  The provided example sentence uses this workaround.  There are no synonyms or antonyms in the traditional sense for a possessive form of a proper noun.  The usage examples and tenses are irrelevant because "latex's" itself is not a verb.
