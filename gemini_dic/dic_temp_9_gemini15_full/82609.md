词源:
The word "guardsmen" is formed from "guardsman," which combines "guard" (meaning to protect or watch over) and "-man" (a suffix indicating a person who performs a specific action).  The word's origin ultimately traces back to Old English "warian" (to guard, watch) and the Old English suffix "-mann" (man).
