fractionation:/ˌfrækʃəˈneɪʃən/| n. |分馏；分级分离；分级 |The process of separating a substance into its components, often based on differences in boiling points or other physical properties.  This technique is widely used in chemistry and other fields to purify substances or isolate specific components. |Example:  The crude oil underwent fractionation to produce gasoline, kerosene, and other petroleum products. = 原油经过分馏以生产汽油、煤油和其他石油产品。

The fractionation of proteins is crucial for studying their individual functions. = 蛋白质的分级分离对于研究其各自的功能至关重要。|近义词：separation, purification, distillation |反义词：combination, mixing |名词
