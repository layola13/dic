mezzotinting:/ˌmɛzoʊˈtɪntɪŋ/ | n. |凹版印刷术； mezzotint版画 |The process of creating a mezzotint, a type of intaglio printmaking.  It involves using a rocker to create a uniformly textured surface on a metal plate, then scraping away areas to create tones and values, resulting in rich, velvety blacks and subtle gradations of light and dark.  Mezzotinting allows for a wide range of tonal values, producing images with a distinctive soft, velvety texture. |Example:  The artist painstakingly created a mezzotinting of the moonlit landscape. = 艺术家煞费苦心地创作了一幅月光下的风景凹版画。 The museum's collection includes several fine examples of 18th-century mezzotinting. = 博物馆的收藏包括几幅精美的18世纪凹版印刷作品。|近义词：intaglio printmaking, engraving (in a broader sense)|反义词：relief printing (e.g., woodcut) |名词
