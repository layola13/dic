词源:
The word "pikestaff" (originally "pike staff") is a compound of "pike" (a long spear) and "staff" (the handle or shaft of a weapon).  "Pikestaves" is the plural form, referring to multiple shafts of pikes.  The figurative usage developed from the image of a structure seemingly supported only by weak, decaying wooden shafts.
