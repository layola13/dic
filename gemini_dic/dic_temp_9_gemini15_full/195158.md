semidefinite:/ˌsemiˈdeɪfɪnət/| adj.|半正定的|  A semidefinite matrix is a symmetric matrix whose eigenvalues are all non-negative.  In simpler terms, it's a matrix that doesn't rotate vectors into negative-magnitude versions of themselves.  This property is crucial in various areas of mathematics, particularly optimization and linear algebra.  It's a generalization of positive definite matrices, where all eigenvalues are strictly positive. |The covariance matrix of a random vector is always positive semidefinite. |positive definite, positive semidefinite| negative definite, negative semidefinite|形容词
