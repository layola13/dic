irradiance:/ɪˈreɪdiəns/| n. |辐照度，辐射照度|The power of electromagnetic radiation incident on a surface per unit area.  It is measured in watts per square meter (W/m²).|例句：The irradiance of the sun at the Earth's surface varies depending on the time of day and weather conditions. 太阳在地球表面的辐照度根据一天中的时间和天气条件而变化。

例句：Researchers measured the irradiance levels at different depths in the ocean. 研究人员测量了海洋不同深度处的辐照度水平。


近义词：radiation flux, radiant flux density|反义词：None specifically, but concepts like "shadow" or "absence of light" represent the opposite effect.|词性:名词

词源:
The word "irradiance" comes from the verb "irradiate," which in turn is formed from the prefix "ir-" (meaning "in" or "upon") and the verb "radiate,"  derived from the Latin word "radius" meaning "ray" or "spoke of a wheel".  Therefore, "irradiance" literally means "the state of being radiated upon"  or the "amount of radiation falling on a surface".
