The word "dozzled" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a dialect word, or a word from a specific fictional context.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.

To provide a response that is helpful, I will offer possibilities based on what "dozzled" *might* be:

**Possibility 1: Misspelling of a known word:**

It could be a misspelling of words like:

* **dazzled:** /ˈdæzəld/ | adj. | 眼花缭乱的，目眩的 |  Extremely impressed or excited; brilliantly bright.  | Example: I was dazzled by the beauty of the sunset.  我被日落的美丽迷住了。 | Near synonyms: amazed, astonished, blinded | Antonyms: unimpressed, bored

**Possibility 2:  A neologism or dialect word:**

If it's a newly coined word or a word used in a specific dialect, there is no readily available information on its meaning, etymology, or usage.


**To get a more accurate analysis:**

Please provide more context.  Where did you encounter this word?  What was the surrounding text or conversation?  This information will help determine its likely meaning and origin.

Without additional context, a detailed analysis as requested in the format provided is not possible.
