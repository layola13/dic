metonymy:/məˈtɒnɪmi/| n. |借代；转喻|Metonymy is a figure of speech in which a thing or concept is not called by its own name, but by the name of something intimately associated with that thing or concept.  It uses a closely related word to stand in for the actual thing being referenced. This differs from metaphor, which involves a direct comparison between two unlike things. |The White House announced a new policy. (The White House stands for the US government.)|近义词：synecdoche, substitution|反义词：无


例句：

He drank the whole bottle. (The bottle stands for the contents of the bottle, the liquid.)


词源：

The word "metonymy" comes from the Greek words *meta* (μετά), meaning "after" or "change," and *onoma* (ὄνομα), meaning "name."  Therefore, literally, it means "change of name."  This reflects the core function of metonymy: substituting one name for another related one.
