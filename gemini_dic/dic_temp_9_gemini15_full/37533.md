词源:  The term "commonhold" is a relatively modern legal term, combining "common" (referring to shared areas) and "hold" (referring to ownership or tenure).  It emerged as a legal framework to address the ownership structures of multi-unit residential buildings, providing an alternative to freehold and leasehold systems.
