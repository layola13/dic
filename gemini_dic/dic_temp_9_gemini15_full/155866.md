photo-etch:/ˈfoʊtoʊˌɛtʃ/| n. |光刻蚀,光化学蚀刻|The process of using light to create an etching on a photosensitive material, typically a metal. This involves exposing a photosensitive material to a pattern of light, then developing the material to remove the exposed or unexposed areas, leaving behind a desired pattern.  It's widely used in microfabrication and printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing.|例句：The intricate details of the microchip were achieved through a precise photo-etch process.|近义词：photolithography, chemical etching|反义词：additive manufacturing
