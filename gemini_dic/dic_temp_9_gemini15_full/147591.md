overpiteousnesses:/ˌoʊvərˈpɪtiəsnəsɪz/| n. |过度怜悯；过分同情；极度悲悯|This word is extremely rare and largely obsolete. It represents an excessive degree of pity or compassion, often to the point of being inappropriate or excessive.  The word is formed by combining "over-" (excessive) with "piteous" (evoking pity), and adding the plural "-nesses" to denote multiple instances or aspects of this excessive pity. There are no readily available examples of its use in modern English literature or conversation due to its rarity and archaic nature.  Finding modern examples would require extensive research into historical texts.|近义词：excessive compassion, undue sympathy, over-empathy|反义词：apathy, indifference, callousness|名词
