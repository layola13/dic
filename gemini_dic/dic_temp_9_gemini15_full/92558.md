词源:
The word "hysterias" is the plural of "hysteria," which originates from the Ancient Greek word "ὑστέρα" (hystera), meaning "womb."  Historically, the condition was attributed to problems with the female reproductive system.  The modern understanding of hysteria is far broader and encompasses a wide range of emotional and psychological states.
