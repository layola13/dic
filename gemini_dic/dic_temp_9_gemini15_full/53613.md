词源:
The word "discarding" comes from the verb "discard," which is formed from the Old French word "descarder," ultimately deriving from the Old Spanish "descartar."  "Des-" is a prefix meaning "to remove" or "away," and the root relates to ideas of "card" or "selection."  The original meaning referred to removing cards from a game or hand, implying a selection process of what to keep and what to remove.  Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass the general act of throwing something away as unwanted.
