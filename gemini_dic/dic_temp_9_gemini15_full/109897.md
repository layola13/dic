The word "liang" is not an English word.  It's likely a word from another language, most probably Chinese (量).  Therefore, a traditional English word analysis is impossible.  If you meant a different word, please provide the correct spelling.  If you intended to ask about the Chinese word 量 (liàng), I can provide information on that.
