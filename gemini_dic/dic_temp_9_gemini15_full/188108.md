词源:
The adverb "roundly" originates from the adjective "round," meaning "complete," "thorough," or "full."  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner in which something is done.  Its evolution reflects a shift in meaning from a purely spatial sense ("in a round manner") to a more figurative sense of completeness and thoroughness in actions or judgments.
