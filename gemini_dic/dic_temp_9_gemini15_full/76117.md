词源:
The word "furthersome" is derived from the verb "further" (meaning "to advance" or "promote") and the suffix "-some," which is used to form adjectives meaning "tending to" or "likely to."  Therefore, "furthersome" literally means "tending to further" or "conducive to furthering."  The word is somewhat archaic or less common in modern English, but still understandable.
