词源:

The word "overdiversifying" is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or too much) and "diversifying" (from "diversify," meaning to make something more varied or diverse).  "Diversify" itself comes from the Latin word "diversificare," which is composed of "diversus" (different) and "facere" (to make).
