photoreversibility:/ˌfoʊtoʊrɪvɜːrsəˈbɪləti/| n.| 光可逆性 | The ability of a substance or process to be reversed by light.  This typically refers to reactions where light triggers a change in a molecule's structure or state, and subsequent exposure to light (often a different wavelength) reverses the change. | Example: The photoreversibility of the pigment allows the plant to adapt quickly to changing light conditions. 光敏色素的光可逆性使植物能够快速适应变化的光照条件。|近义词：light reversibility, photochromism|反义词：irreversibility
