词源:
The word "frankable" derives from the verb "frank," meaning "to send (a letter or package) free of charge," ultimately from the Old French word *franc*, meaning "free."  The concept of "franking" privileges originated in the postal systems of medieval Europe, where certain individuals (officials, clergy etc.) were granted the right to send mail free of charge.  The adjective "frankable" thus signifies something eligible for this privilege.
