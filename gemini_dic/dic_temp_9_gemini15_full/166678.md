词源:
The word "preserved" comes from the Old French word "preserver," which means "to guard, protect, or keep safe."  The Old French word itself is derived from the Latin word "preservare,"  a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in front of") and "servare" (meaning "to keep, save, or preserve").  Thus, the root meaning points to the act of keeping something safe from harm or decay.
