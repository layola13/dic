词源:
The word "pandering" ultimately derives from the Old French word "pander," meaning "a procurer" (someone who arranges sexual encounters).  This meaning evolved from the character Pandarus in Chaucer's "Troilus and Criseyde," who facilitated the affair between Troilus and Cressida.  The modern sense of "pandering" as obsequious flattery or the act of appeasing developed from this association with facilitating desires and pleasing others, even if those desires are morally questionable.
