词源:
The word "semi-precious" is a compound word.  "Semi-" is a prefix meaning "half" or "partly," derived from Latin "semi-". "Precious" comes from Old French "precieux," ultimately from Latin "pretiosus," meaning "valuable" or "costly."  Therefore, "semi-precious" literally means "partly precious" or "less precious."
