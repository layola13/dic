词源:

The word "post-tectonic" is a compound word combining:

* **post-**: a prefix meaning "after" or "following".  It derives from Latin *post*.
* **tectonic**:  relating to the structure or movement of the Earth's crust. This term originates from the Greek word *tektonikos*, meaning "pertaining to building" or "constructive".  The Greek root is *tekton*, meaning "builder" or "carpenter".

Therefore, post-tectonic literally means "after the building of the earth's structures (mountains, etc.)".
