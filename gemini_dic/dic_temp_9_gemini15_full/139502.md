词源:

The word "obstructive" comes from the Latin word "obstruere," which means "to obstruct" or "to block."  The prefix "ob-" means "against" or "in the way of," and "struere" means "to build" or "to pile up."  Therefore, "obstruere" literally means "to build against" or "to pile up in the way of."  Over time, "obstruere" evolved into the English word "obstruct," and "obstructive" is its adjectival form.
