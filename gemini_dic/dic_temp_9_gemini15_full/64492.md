erodability: /ɪˌroʊdəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可蚀性，易蚀性 | The susceptibility of a material to erosion.  It refers to how easily a substance can be worn away by natural processes like water, wind, or ice.  The erodability of a soil depends on factors such as its texture, structure, and organic matter content. | 例句：The high erodability of the topsoil led to significant land degradation.  高表土的可蚀性导致了严重的土地退化。

The erodability of the coastal cliffs is a major concern.  海岸悬崖的可蚀性是一个主要问题。


近义词：susceptibility to erosion, vulnerability to erosion | 反义词：resistance to erosion, erosion-resistance


词性：名词

词源：
The word "erodability" is derived from the verb "erode" (to gradually wear away or destroy something), which in turn comes from the Latin word "erodere," meaning "to gnaw away." The suffix "-ability" indicates the capacity or potential for something.
