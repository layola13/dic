polyglacialism:/ˌpɒliˈɡleɪʃəlɪzəm/| n. |多冰期作用|The occurrence of several glacial periods separated by interglacial periods within a larger geological timescale.  It refers to a series of ice ages, each with its own advance and retreat of glaciers,  rather than a single long ice age.|The evidence suggests a polyglacialism pattern in the region, with multiple glacial advances and retreats occurring over millions of years.|近义词：multiple glaciation, repeated glaciation|反义词：monoglacialism


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Polyglacialism explains the complex geological formations. = 多冰期作用解释了复杂的地质构造。

How does polyglacialism affect the distribution of certain species? = 多冰期作用如何影响某些物种的分布？

否定句:
The hypothesis doesn't support the occurrence of polyglacialism in this specific region. = 这个假设不支持在这个特定地区发生多冰期作用。
This geological formation was not formed solely by polyglacialism; other factors were involved. = 这种地质构造并非仅仅由多冰期作用形成；还涉及其他因素。
