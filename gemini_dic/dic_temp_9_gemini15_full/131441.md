词源:

The word "noncoalescences" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the noun "coalescences," which in turn derives from the verb "coalesce."  "Coalesce" comes from the Late Latin word "coalescere," which is formed from "co-" (meaning "together") and "alescere" (meaning "to grow" or "to increase").  Therefore, "noncoalescences" literally means "the state of not growing together" or "the state of not merging."
