词源:

The word "iatraliptic" comes from Greek:  "iatr-" (ιατρ-) meaning "physician" or "healing," and "-liptic"  (from  λείπειν, *leibein*, "to leave, to omit").  The combination suggests something related to the practice of a physician, specifically implying a treatment or cure, though the "-liptic" element is less directly translatable in modern usage than the "iatr-" portion.  The word is relatively rare in modern English.
