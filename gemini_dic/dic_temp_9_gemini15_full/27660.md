词源:
Comes from the French word "candidature," formed from "candidat" (candidate) + "-ure" (a suffix forming nouns denoting state, condition, or action).  The word "candidate" itself originates from the Latin "candidatus," meaning "clothed in white," referring to the white toga worn by Roman candidates for office.
