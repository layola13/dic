self-sedimentation: /ˌsɛlfˌsɛdɪmənˈteɪʃən/ | n. | 自沉淀；自行沉降 |

英文解析:The process by which particles in a suspension settle out of the liquid or gas they are suspended in due to gravity, without any external force or intervention.  It is a natural process driven by the difference in density between the particles and the surrounding medium.


例句:

The self-sedimentation of the red blood cells was observed under the microscope.  显微镜下观察到红细胞的自沉淀。

The rate of self-sedimentation is affected by factors such as particle size, density, and the viscosity of the fluid. 自沉淀速率受颗粒大小、密度和流体粘度等因素影响。


近义词: sedimentation, settling, precipitation


反义词:  suspension, flotation


词性: noun
