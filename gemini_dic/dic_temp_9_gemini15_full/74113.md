词源:
The word "foul" originates from Old French "fouler," meaning "to trample," "to tread underfoot," or "to crush."  This sense of physical trampling evolved to encompass the idea of something being soiled or defiled, leading to its modern meanings.  The connection to sports infractions comes from the idea of "fouling" an opponent's play by illegal means.
