词源:
The word "overlook" comes from the Old English "oferlocian," which literally means "to look over" or "to look beyond."  The prefix "over-" indicates the sense of looking from above or beyond, and "look" retains its modern meaning.  The shift from the literal sense of looking over something to the figurative sense of ignoring or missing something occurred gradually over time.
