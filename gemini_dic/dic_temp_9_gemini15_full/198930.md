sievert:/ˈsiːvɜːrt/| n. |西弗|The sievert (symbol: Sv) is the derived unit of ionizing radiation dose in the International System of Units (SI).  It represents the biological effect of radiation on human tissue. One sievert is equal to one joule per kilogram (J/kg).  It measures the equivalent dose, considering the type and energy of the radiation and its effectiveness in causing biological damage.|例句：The worker received a dose of 0.5 sieverts of radiation.  这位工人接受了0.5西弗的辐射剂量。
The maximum permissible dose of radiation for workers is usually set at around 50 millisieverts per year.  工人的最大允许辐射剂量通常设定为每年约50毫西弗。|近义词：gray (Gy) (measures absorbed dose)|反义词：无|词性:n.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The dose is measured in sieverts. = 剂量以西弗为单位测量。
How many sieverts did the patient receive? = 病人接受了多少西弗的辐射？


一般过去时:
The accident resulted in a high sievert exposure. = 事故导致了高剂量的西弗辐射暴露。
She received several sieverts during the treatment. = 她在治疗过程中接受了几西弗的辐射。


现在完成时:
The workers have received their annual sievert limit. = 工人们已经达到了他们每年的西弗限值。
Scientists have measured the sieverts released by the nuclear plant. = 科学家们已经测量了核电站释放的西弗量。


过去完成时:
The patient had already received a significant sievert dose before the diagnosis. = 在诊断之前，病人已经接受了大量的西弗剂量。
They had exceeded the allowed sieverts before the safety protocols were implemented. = 在实施安全协议之前，他们已经超过了允许的西弗量。


将来时:
The new safety measures will reduce sievert exposure. = 新的安全措施将减少西弗辐射暴露。
We will monitor the sieverts emitted by the equipment. = 我们将监测设备释放的西弗量。


虚拟语气:
If the exposure had been higher, the sieverts would have been lethal. = 如果暴露量更高，西弗量将是致命的。
It is important to reduce sieverts as much as possible, even if it means higher costs. = 尽可能减少西弗量很重要，即使这意味着更高的成本。


被动语态:
The sieverts were carefully measured by the technicians. = 西弗量由技术人员仔细测量。
The sievert limit was exceeded in the incident. = 在事故中，西弗限值被超过了。


疑问句:
What is the sievert limit for this type of work? = 这种工作类型的西弗限值是多少？
How many sieverts are considered dangerous? = 多少西弗被认为是危险的？


否定句:
The worker did not receive a dangerous level of sieverts. = 该工人没有接受危险水平的西弗辐射。
The device did not emit measurable sieverts. = 该设备没有发出可测量的西弗辐射。


PHRASE->
milliSieverts (mSv) = 毫西弗
microsieverts (µSv) = 微西弗
effective dose in sieverts = 等效剂量（西弗）
annual sievert limit = 年度西弗限值
absorbed dose in sieverts = 吸收剂量（西弗）
