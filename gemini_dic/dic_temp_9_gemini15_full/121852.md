词源:

* **mis-**:  A prefix meaning "wrong," "bad," or "ill."
* **represent**: From Latin "repraesentare," meaning "to present again," "to represent."  This in turn comes from "re-" (again) and "praesentare" (to present).
* **-ation**: A suffix forming nouns of action or process.

Therefore, "misrepresentation" literally means "the act of wrongly or falsely representing something."
