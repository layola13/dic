词源:  The phrase is a compound of the verbs "get up" (to rise from bed or a seated position, implying action and activity) and "go" (to move, act, proceed, implying forward momentum).  The combination suggests the energetic combination of waking up and immediately acting, reflecting a person's dynamism and proactive nature.  It emerged in the early 20th century as a colloquial expression.  There isn't a formal etymology tracing it back to a specific origin, but its meaning is clearly derived from its constituent words.
