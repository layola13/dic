词源:  The word "showboating" combines "show" (a public display or performance) and "boating," which in this context refers to the leisurely and often ostentatious manner of a boat's movement.  The imagery suggests a showy, leisurely display, not necessarily focused on practical achievement.  The term originated in the context of sports, particularly rowing, and later extended to other fields.
