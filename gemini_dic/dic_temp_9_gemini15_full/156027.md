The flowering time is determined by photomesic factors. = 开花时间由光周期因素决定。


疑问句:
Is this plant species truly photomesic? = 这个植物物种真的是光周期性的吗？
Are there any other factors besides photomesic cues that influence flowering? = 除了光周期线索外，还有什么其他因素会影响开花？


否定句:
The growth of this particular plant is not significantly photomesic. = 这种特定植物的生长并不显著地受光周期影响。
The response was not solely photomesic; other environmental factors played a role. = 反应并非仅仅是光周期性的；其他环境因素也发挥了作用。
