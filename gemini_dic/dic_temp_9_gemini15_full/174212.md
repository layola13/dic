quenchableness: /kwɛntʃəb(ə)lnəs/ | n. | 可淬灭性，可骤冷性 | The ability to be quenched or rapidly cooled.  This term is primarily used in metallurgy and materials science, referring to the capacity of a material to withstand a quenching process without cracking or other damage.  | Example: The high quenchableness of this alloy allows for the production of strong, durable parts.  这个合金的高淬透性使得能够生产出坚固耐用的零件。 | 近义词: quench ability, cool ability | 反义词: brittleness (in relation to quenching)


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "hello".  The usage is limited to describing a material's property.  Therefore, typical tense conjugations are not applicable.  Instead, we'll illustrate its use in different sentence structures.

Declarative sentences:
The steel's high quenchableness is crucial for its application in this tool.  =  这种钢材的高淬透性对于其在此工具中的应用至关重要。
The alloy demonstrated excellent quenchableness during testing. = 该合金在测试中表现出优异的淬透性。


Interrogative sentences:
What is the quenchableness of this particular type of stainless steel? = 这种特定类型的 不锈钢的淬透性如何？
Does the increased carbon content affect the quenchableness of the metal? = 碳含量的增加是否会影响金属的淬透性？


Negative sentences:
The poor quenchableness of the material led to numerous cracks. = 材料的淬透性差导致许多裂纹。
This material does not exhibit sufficient quenchableness for this purpose. = 这种材料的淬透性不足以用于此目的。
