词源：

The word "scalable" derives from the verb "scale," meaning to climb or ascend, or to adjust to a particular size or level.  The sense of "scalable" emerged from the idea of something that can be easily "scaled up" or "scaled down" in size or capacity.  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or possibility.
