heteromorphous:/ˌhɛtərəˈmɔːrfəs/| adj.|异形的，形态不同的|Having different forms or shapes; exhibiting polymorphism.  The term is often used in biology to describe organisms or structures that display variation in form, especially within a single species or taxonomic group.  It contrasts with homomorphous, which means having the same form or shape.|例句：The heteromorphous crystals exhibited a wide range of shapes and sizes. 异形晶体展现出各种各样的形状和大小。

The heteromorphous leaves of the plant were easily distinguished. 植物上形态不同的叶子很容易区分。


近义词：polymorphic, diverse, varied, dissimilar|反义词：homomorphous, uniform, similar


词源:  From hetero- (other, different) + morph (form, shape) + -ous (having the quality of).  The roots are Greek:  *heteros* (ἕτερος) meaning "other" or "different," and *morphē* (μορφή) meaning "form" or "shape."
