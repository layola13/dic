pronationalists:/ˌproʊˌnæʃənəlɪsts/ | n. | 拥护民族主义者，民族主义拥护者 |  Supporters or advocates of pronationalism (a strong sense of national pride and identity, often associated with aggressive nationalism).  They often prioritize the interests of their own nation above others and may promote policies that benefit their nation, sometimes at the expense of international cooperation or other nations' interests. | Example: The pronationalists rallied in the square, waving flags and chanting patriotic slogans.  拥护民族主义者在广场集会，挥舞旗帜，高呼爱国口号。


The term "pronationalists" is not a standard or widely used word in dictionaries. It appears to be a relatively recent coinage, combining the prefix "pro-" (meaning "in favor of" or "supporting") with "nationalists."  Therefore, a detailed etymological breakdown is not readily available.  Its meaning is derived from the combination of its constituent parts.


The word is formed by combining:

* **pro-:**  A prefix meaning "in favor of," "supporting," or "advocating for."
* **nationalist:** A person who strongly identifies with and advocates for their nation's interests.

Therefore, a "pronationalist" is someone who strongly supports nationalism, often to an extreme degree.
