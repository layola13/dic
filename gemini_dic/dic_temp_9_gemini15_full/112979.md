词源:
The word "lullaby" comes from the Middle English "lulliby," which is believed to be derived from the repeated use of the sound "lul,"  a sound associated with soothing or comforting infants.  The "-by" suffix is of uncertain origin, possibly a corruption of "bye-bye," meaning "goodbye."  It combines elements of mimicking infant sounds with a sense of farewell or ending.
