galenite:/ˈɡælənaɪt/| n. |方铅矿|Lead sulfide, PbS, the most important ore of lead.  It is a common mineral found in many geological environments, often associated with other sulfide minerals. Galena is characterized by its cubic crystal structure and high density. Its color is typically lead-gray with a metallic luster. It is relatively soft and easily cleaves along perfect cubic planes.|The galena sample showed excellent cubic cleavage.|近义词：lead sulfide|反义词:无
