词源:
The word "gainsome" is derived from the Old English word "geanesum," which means "pleasant," "agreeable," or "gainful." The word "gain" in this context doesn't refer to profit, but rather to pleasure or benefit.  It shares etymological roots with words like "gain" (as in "to obtain") and "again," reflecting a sense of acquisition of something positive.
