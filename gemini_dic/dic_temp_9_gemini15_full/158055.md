plasma:/ˈplæzmə/|/ˈplæzmɑː/| n. |血浆；等离子体；等离子态|The fourth state of matter, consisting of a gas of ions and electrons.| Blood plasma is the pale yellow liquid component of blood that normally holds the blood cells in whole blood in suspension.  It is also the main component of blood, constituting about 55% of its volume.  Plasma is vital for the transport of nutrients, hormones and proteins throughout the body. |serum, fluid|solid|

例句：

The scientist studied the properties of plasma in a controlled environment. = 科学家在一个受控环境中研究了等离子体的特性。

The doctor ordered a blood plasma test to check for infections. = 医生下令进行血浆测试以检查感染。


词源:

From Late Latin *plasma, neuter of plasmāt-, plasmaticus, from Greek πλάσμα (plasma, "something molded," "anything formed"), from πλάσσειν (plássein, "to mold," "to shape").  The scientific use of the word to refer to the liquid part of blood is relatively recent, emerging in the 19th century. The use to describe the fourth state of matter is even more modern.


近义词：

serum (血清),  fluid (液体)


反义词：

solid (固体)
