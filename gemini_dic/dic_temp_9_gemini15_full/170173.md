protoplanets:/ˈproʊtoʊˌplænɪts/ | n. |原行星 |A protoplanet is a large body of matter in the early stages of planet formation.  It is a celestial body that has not yet become a fully formed planet. Protoplanets are believed to form from the accretion of dust and gas within a protoplanetary disk surrounding a young star. They gradually grow in size through collisions and mergers with other planetesimals, eventually becoming planets or being ejected from the system. | Example:  The early solar system was filled with protoplanets that eventually collided and merged to form the planets we see today.  早期太阳系充满了原行星，它们最终碰撞并合并形成了我们今天看到的行星。|近义词：planetesimal |反义词：planet (in the fully formed sense)
