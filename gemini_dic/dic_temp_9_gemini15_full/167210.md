Etymology:

The word "pretense" originates from the Old French word "pretense," meaning "intention," "claim," or "pretension."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "praetendere," which means "to stretch forth," "to allege," or "to put forward."  The evolution of meaning reflects a shift from a general sense of presenting something to a more specific connotation of false presentation or feigning.
