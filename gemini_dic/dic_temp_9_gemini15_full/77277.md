gastrula:/ˈɡæstrəlʌ/| n. |原肠胚|A gastrula is an early stage of embryonic development in animals. It is formed after the blastula stage and is characterized by the formation of germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm), which will eventually give rise to all the tissues and organs of the body.  The process of gastrula formation is called gastrulation.  The gastrula is a hollow sphere of cells with an invagination (infolding) that forms the archenteron (primitive gut).|The sea urchin gastrula is a classic model organism for studying embryonic development.|近义词：embryo (in a specific stage)|反义词：None directly applicable.  Perhaps blastula (preceding stage).
