词源:  The word "meritocracy" was coined by Michael Young in his satirical novel "The Rise of the Meritocracy" (1958).  He used it to describe a dystopian society where social status was determined solely by intelligence and achievement, ultimately leading to a rigid class system.  The term's original intent was negative, highlighting the potential downsides of such a system.  However, over time, the term has gained broader usage, often without the inherent critique.
