The word "hidetatsu" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a transliteration of a Japanese word or name.  Therefore, a standard English word analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, more context is needed.  Is this a proper noun (a person's name)?  Is it a word from a specific dialect or genre?  Knowing the source language and intended meaning would allow for a more accurate explanation.
