词源:
The word "industrialised" is derived from the noun "industry" and the suffix "-alised," which is a variant of "-ized."  "Industry" itself comes from the Old French "industrie," ultimately from the Latin "industria," meaning "diligence, activity." The suffix "-alised" indicates the process of becoming or making something industrial.
