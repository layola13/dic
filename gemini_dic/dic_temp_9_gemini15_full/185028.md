The word "rethanks" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need to consider what the intended meaning might be.  It appears to be a combination of "re-" (again) and "thanks" (thank you).

If the intention is to express repeated thanks, here are some alternatives and their analysis:

**1. Thanks again:**

/θæŋks əˈɡɛn/ | Phrase |再次感谢 | Expressing gratitude a second time or more. | Example: "Thanks again for your help!"  再次感谢你的帮助！ | Near Synonyms:  Many thanks again, Thank you once more | Antonyms: N/A (it's an expression of gratitude)

**USAGE (for "Thanks again" as an example):**

Because "Thanks again" is a phrase, not a single word with verb conjugations, the typical tense breakdowns don't apply.  The context determines the timing of the thanks.


**PHRASE (Examples using "Thanks"):**

* Thanks a lot = 非常感谢
* Thanks in advance = 预先感谢
* Thanks for everything = 感谢一切
* Thanks for having me = 谢谢你的款待

Note that there is no direct antonym for an expression of gratitude like "thanks again".  You could express the opposite sentiment with phrases indicating displeasure or anger, but these wouldn't be antonyms in the strict sense.
