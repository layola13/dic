fine-tuner: /ˈfaɪnˌtuːnər/ | n. |微调器，精调器 | A person or thing that makes small adjustments to improve something.  A fine-tuner is used to make precise alterations to optimize performance or achieve a desired outcome.  It often implies a level of precision and detail beyond simple adjustment. |Example:  The engineer used a fine-tuner to adjust the engine's performance.  工程师用微调器调整发动机的性能。  The AI model's fine-tuner improved its accuracy significantly. AI模型的微调器显著提高了其准确性。|近义词： adjuster, calibrator, optimizer |反义词：粗调器 (粗调器没有直接对应的英文单词，需要根据语境翻译，例如：rough adjuster, coarse tuner)|
