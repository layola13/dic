词源:
The word "jogging" comes from the verb "jog," which  itself has a long history. Its origins trace back to the Old Norse word *jǫkka, meaning "to shake, to jolt."  Over time,  "jog" evolved to mean a gentle, unsteady movement.  The modern sense of "jogging" as a form of exercise emerged in the late 20th century.
