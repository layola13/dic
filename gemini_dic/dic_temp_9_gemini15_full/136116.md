nonreducing: /ˌnɒn rɪˈdjuːsɪŋ/ | adj. |非还原性的；不发生还原反应的|  Describes a sugar or other substance that does not undergo reduction reactions, typically because its anomeric carbon is involved in a glycosidic bond.  This means it cannot be oxidized by mild oxidizing agents like Benedict's solution or Fehling's solution. | Example: Sucrose is a nonreducing sugar because the anomeric carbons of both glucose and fructose are involved in the glycosidic bond.  蔗糖是一种非还原性糖，因为葡萄糖和果糖的异头碳都参与了糖苷键的形成。| 近义词: unreactive (in this context) | 反义词: reducing |


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The sugar is nonreducing. = 这种糖是非还原性的。
This compound remains nonreducing under these conditions. = 在这种条件下，这种化合物保持非还原性。


一般过去时:
The sample was nonreducing. = 样本是非还原性的。
The reaction did not produce a reducing sugar; it remained nonreducing. = 反应没有产生还原糖；它仍然是非还原性的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several nonreducing disaccharides. = 科学家已经鉴定了几种非还原性二糖。
The analysis has shown that the substance is nonreducing. = 分析表明该物质是非还原性的。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, the solution had been nonreducing. = 实验前，溶液是非还原性的。
They had determined that the sugar was nonreducing before proceeding. = 在继续之前，他们已经确定该糖是非还原性的。


将来时:
The test will show whether the substance is nonreducing. = 测试将显示该物质是否为非还原性。
This new method will likely identify more nonreducing sugars. = 这种新方法可能会鉴定出更多非还原性糖。


虚拟语气:
If the sugar were nonreducing, it would not react with Benedict's solution. = 如果这种糖是非还原性的，它就不会与本尼迪特试剂反应。
I wish the sample had been nonreducing for easier analysis. = 我希望样品是非还原性的，以便更容易分析。


被动语态:
The nonreducing sugar was identified by its lack of reactivity. = 非还原性糖是通过其缺乏反应性来鉴定的。
The presence of nonreducing sugars is confirmed by the negative test. = 阴性测试证实了非还原性糖的存在。


疑问句:
Is this disaccharide nonreducing? = 这种二糖是非还原性的吗？
Are all polysaccharides nonreducing? = 所有多糖都是非还原性的吗？


否定句:
The sugar is not nonreducing; it's a reducing sugar. = 这种糖不是非还原性的；它是还原性糖。
The results indicate that the compound is not nonreducing. = 结果表明该化合物不是非还原性的。


PHRASE->
nonreducing sugar = 非还原性糖
nonreducing disaccharide = 非还原性二糖
nonreducing end = 非还原性末端
nonreducing properties = 非还原性性质
nonreducing oligosaccharide = 非还原性寡糖
