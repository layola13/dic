Muconic acid is an important intermediate in the biosynthesis of various compounds. | The researchers investigated the production of muconic acid from biomass. 研究人员调查了从生物质中生产己二烯酸的方法。| 近义词：hexadienedioic (referring to the chemical structure) | 反义词：无


USAGE->
This word is primarily used as an adjective in scientific and technical contexts, particularly within chemistry and biochemistry.  Therefore,  demonstrating tense usage is less relevant than understanding its application in different sentence structures.

Example Sentences:

A. Muconic acid is a valuable precursor for the production of bio-based materials. 己二烯酸是生产生物基材料的宝贵前体。

B. The muconic acid pathway plays a crucial role in microbial metabolism. 己二烯酸途径在微生物代谢中起着至关重要的作用。

C.  A new process for the synthesis of muconic acid esters has been developed. 开发了一种新的己二烯酸酯合成方法。

D. The study focused on the enzymatic conversion of glucose to muconic acid derivatives.  这项研究的重点是葡萄糖酶促转化为己二烯酸衍生物。

E. Several muconic acid-based polymers are currently under investigation. 目前正在研究几种基于己二烯酸的聚合物。


PHRASE->
Because "muconic" is primarily used as an adjective modifying "acid" or other chemical terms,  phrase examples are context-dependent.  It does not typically combine with many common words to create idiomatic phrases.  Instead, it appears in technical descriptions such as:

A. Muconic acid production: 己二烯酸生产
B. Muconic acid pathway: 己二烯酸途径
C. Muconic acid derivatives: 己二烯酸衍生物
D. Muconic acid esters: 己二烯酸酯
E. Microbial muconic acid synthesis: 微生物己二烯酸合成
