词源:  The word "moderationist" derives from the noun "moderation,"  meaning the avoidance of excess or extremes. "Moderation" itself comes from the Latin word "moderatio," from "moderatus," the past participle of "moderari," meaning "to restrain, regulate, keep within bounds." The suffix "-ist" is added to create the noun denoting a person who practices or advocates moderation.
