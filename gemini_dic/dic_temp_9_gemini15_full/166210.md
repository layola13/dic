/prɪˈpɜːrpəsəz/ | n. |预先的目的；预先打算 |The word "prepurposes" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word or a misspelling. It seems to combine "pre-" (meaning before) and "purposes" (meaning intentions or aims).  Therefore, a reasonable interpretation would be "intentions formed in advance" or "prior plans". However,  its lack of established usage prevents a definitive definition and grammatical analysis.  There are no standard examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical usages available for a word that does not exist in standard dictionaries.  To use the intended meaning, one would need to use established words and phrases instead. For example, one could use phrases like "prior intentions," "preconceived plans," "previously determined goals," or "advance planning." |  No example sentences can be provided as it's not a real word. |近义词: prior intentions, preconceived plans, previously determined goals, advance planning |反义词:  impromptu plans, spontaneous actions |n.
