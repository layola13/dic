The word "interdialectal" is formed from the prefix "inter-" meaning "between" or "among," and "dialectal," which relates to dialects.  "Dialectal" itself derives from "dialect," ultimately from the Greek "dialektos" (διάλεκτος), meaning "conversation," "speech," or "manner of speaking."

Therefore, "interdialectal" signifies something that exists or occurs *between* or *among* different dialects.  It often refers to the comparative study of linguistic features that distinguish one dialect from another, focusing on similarities and differences in vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation across a range of dialects.
