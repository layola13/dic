词源:

The phrase "follow suit" originates from the card game of whist.  In whist, when a player leads a suit (a category of playing cards such as hearts, diamonds, clubs, or spades), the other players must follow suit if they have a card of that suit.  If they don't have a card of that suit, they can play any card.  The phrase's figurative use extends this concept to other contexts, meaning to do what others have done.
