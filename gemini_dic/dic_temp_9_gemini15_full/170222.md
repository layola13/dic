The protracheata hypothesis suggests that these two groups share a common ancestor that possessed a tracheal respiratory system. However, this hypothesis is not universally accepted and its validity is debated among scientists.|例句：The phylogenetic position of protracheata remains a subject of ongoing research. 原气管类动物的系统发育位置仍然是持续研究的主题。|近义词：none|反义词：none|名词
