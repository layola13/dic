词源：The word "cutesy" is a diminutive of "cute," formed by adding the suffix "-sy" which is often used to create words suggesting something small, charming or slightly affected.  The suffix "-sy" itself has origins in Old English and has a similar function in other words like "homely" and "bossy".  The core meaning derives from "acute," meaning sharp or keen, and its evolution into "cute" reflects a shift in meaning over time.
