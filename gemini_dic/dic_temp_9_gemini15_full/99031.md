interallelic: /ˌɪntərəˈliːlɪk/ | adj. | 等位基因间的；在等位基因之间的 | Relating to or occurring between alleles.  | Example: Interallelic complementation is a phenomenon where two nonfunctional alleles of a gene can produce a functional protein when present together. 等位基因间互补是一种现象，其中一个基因的两个非功能等位基因当同时存在时可以产生功能性蛋白质。 | 近义词: intragenic (if referring to interactions within a gene), allelic (but this refers to the alleles themselves, not the interaction between them) | 反义词: interchromosomal (referring to interactions between different chromosomes)
