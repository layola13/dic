词源：
The word "previsibility" is derived from the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and the word "visibility" (the state or quality of being visible or easily seen).  Therefore, previsibility literally refers to the ability to see or know something beforehand.  It's a relatively modern word, formed through combining existing morphemes.
