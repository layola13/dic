The word "dangerousdendrs" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a made-up word, possibly a combination of "dangerous" and a word related to trees or branches ("dendr" is a combining form referring to trees or wood).  Therefore, a standard lexical analysis is impossible.  I cannot provide pronunciation, word class, meaning, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as it doesn't exist as a word with established meaning.

If this word was intended to be something else, or if there's a typo, please provide the correct spelling or context, and I will be happy to help.
