paraphysis:/pærəˈfaɪsɪs/ | n. |侧丝，副丝|A sterile, hair-like appendage found in some plants, particularly in mosses and liverworts.  It's usually located among the sporangia and helps in the dispersal of spores.| Example: The paraphyses of this moss species are particularly long and slender.  这个苔藓物种的侧丝特别长而细。|近义词：sterile filament (无性细丝)|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The paraphysis protects the spores. = 侧丝保护孢子。
Paraphyses surround the sporangia. = 侧丝包围孢子囊。


一般过去时:
The paraphysis helped disperse the spores. = 侧丝帮助孢子传播。
Scientists observed the paraphyses carefully. = 科学家仔细观察了侧丝。


现在完成时:
The research has identified new types of paraphyses. = 研究已经发现了新型的侧丝。
Botanists have studied the function of paraphyses extensively. = 植物学家广泛研究了侧丝的功能。


过去完成时:
The spores had already been dispersed before the paraphyses withered. = 在侧丝枯萎之前，孢子已经被传播了。
The scientists had already examined the paraphyses under a microscope. = 科学家已经在显微镜下检查过侧丝了。


将来时:
Further research will analyze the genetic makeup of paraphyses. = 后续研究将分析侧丝的基因构成。
Researchers will observe how the paraphyses interact with the environment. = 研究人员将观察侧丝如何与环境相互作用。


虚拟语气:
If the paraphyses were absent, spore dispersal would be less efficient. = 如果没有侧丝，孢子传播效率会降低。
I wish I had a better understanding of the paraphyses' role in reproduction. = 我希望我对侧丝在繁殖中的作用有更好的理解。


被动语态:
The paraphyses were examined under a microscope. = 侧丝在显微镜下被检查。
The structure of the paraphyses is being studied by researchers. = 侧丝的结构正在被研究人员研究。


疑问句:
What is the primary function of the paraphyses? = 侧丝的主要功能是什么？
How do the paraphyses contribute to spore dispersal? = 侧丝如何促进孢子传播？


否定句:
The plant does not have visible paraphyses. = 该植物没有可见的侧丝。
The study did not find a significant correlation between paraphysis length and spore dispersal. = 该研究没有发现侧丝长度与孢子传播之间存在显著相关性。


PHRASE->
paraphysis structure = 侧丝结构
paraphysis morphology = 侧丝形态
paraphysis development = 侧丝发育
paraphysis function = 侧丝功能
types of paraphyses = 侧丝类型
