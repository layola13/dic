The term "ringbird" doesn't have a specific etymological history documented in major dictionaries. It's a descriptive term, combining "ring" (referring to the sound of the bird's song, often bell-like or resonant) and "bird".  The term's usage is primarily informal and observational.


近义词: songbird, warbler, singer (referring to birds)


反义词:  There is no direct antonym, as the term is descriptive rather than comparative.  One could use terms like "mute bird" or "silent bird" to describe its opposite, but these are not true antonyms.
