conidium:/kəˈnɪdiəm/| n. |分生孢子|A conidium is a non-motile, asexual spore produced by various fungi. It is formed at the tip or side of a specialized hypha called a conidiophore. Unlike spores produced by other means, conidia are not formed within a sac-like structure (sporangium). They are typically dispersed by wind or other means.  | Example: The fungus produced numerous conidia, which were then carried by the wind to new locations.  |近义词：spore (general term)|反义词：无


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The fungus produces many conidia. = 这种真菌产生许多分生孢子。
Conidia are dispersed by wind. = 分生孢子由风传播。


一般过去时:
The researcher observed numerous conidia under the microscope. = 研究人员在显微镜下观察到许多分生孢子。
The fungus released its conidia into the air. = 真菌释放了它的分生孢子到空气中。


现在完成时:
The experiment has shown that the conidia have germinated. = 实验表明分生孢子已经萌发。
Scientists have identified several types of conidia. = 科学家已经鉴定了几种类型的分生孢子。


过去完成时:
The conidia had already germinated before the experiment began. = 实验开始之前，分生孢子就已经萌发了。
The researchers had collected the conidia samples the previous day. = 研究人员在前一天收集了分生孢子样本。


将来时:
The conidia will germinate under suitable conditions. = 在合适的条件下，分生孢子将会萌发。
The scientists will analyze the conidia for genetic markers. = 科学家们将分析分生孢子的遗传标记。


虚拟语气:
If the conidia were exposed to sunlight, they would not germinate. = 如果分生孢子暴露在阳光下，它们将不会萌发。
It is essential that the conidia be kept in a sterile environment. = 分生孢子必须保存在无菌环境中至关重要。


被动语态:
The conidia were observed under a microscope. = 分生孢子在显微镜下观察。
The conidia were collected and analyzed. = 分生孢子被收集并分析。


疑问句:
How are conidia dispersed? = 分生孢子是如何传播的？
What are the characteristics of these conidia? = 这些分生孢子的特征是什么？


否定句:
The fungus did not produce any conidia. = 这种真菌没有产生任何分生孢子。
The experiment did not show any significant germination of the conidia. = 实验没有显示分生孢子有任何显著的萌发。


PHRASE->
conidia formation 分生孢子形成
conidia production 分生孢子产生
conidia germination 分生孢子萌发
conidia morphology 分生孢子形态
