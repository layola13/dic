/prɪˈfɛstɪvəlz/ | n. | 节日前夕的庆祝活动 |  The word "prefestivals" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It's a newly coined word formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before) and "festivals" (meaning celebrations). It logically refers to activities, events, or preparations that occur in the period leading up to a festival or festivals.  There are no established synonyms or antonyms, as it's not a recognized lexical item.  The usage would be similar to other words describing pre-event activities, but it's important to note the lack of formal dictionary definition. | The city is bustling with prefestivals; shops are decorated, and streets are filled with excited crowds. = 城市里充满了节日的喧嚣；商店装饰一新，街道上挤满了兴奋的人群。 The prefestivals included a parade and a series of concerts. = 节日前夕的活动包括一场游行和一系列音乐会。|  pre-holiday events, pre-celebration activities |  post-festival events | n.
