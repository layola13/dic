WORD ORIGIN->

The word "interpenetrations" is formed from the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among"), the verb "penetrate" (meaning "to pierce or enter"), and the suffix "-ation" (forming nouns of action or process).  The prefix indicates a reciprocal action, meaning the penetration is happening mutually between entities. The root "penetrate" comes from the Latin "penetrare," which is formed from "penetrare" (to go through) + "-are" (verb suffix). Therefore, the word's etymology points to a process of mutual permeation or interaction.
