词源:
From Old French *rallier, from Middle High German *rallieren, from Old French *ralier, variant of *railler (to rally, jest, mock), from Frankish *hro- ("army") + *-ljan ("to call").  The meaning evolved from a military sense of calling troops together to a broader sense of gathering or recovering.
