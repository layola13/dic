词源:

The word "ceremonialness" is derived from the adjective "ceremonial," which itself comes from the noun "ceremony."  "Ceremony" ultimately traces back to the Latin word "caeremonia," of uncertain origin, but possibly related to the Etruscan word "ceremonia," meaning "sacred rite."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun, indicating a quality or state.
