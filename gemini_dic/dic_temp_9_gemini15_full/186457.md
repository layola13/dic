The word "{rican}" is not a complete word in itself. It's a suffix used to form words relating to specific regions or people of the Americas.  Therefore, a complete analysis in the requested format isn't possible without specifying the word it's attached to (e.g., American, Mexican, Puerto Rican).  However, I can give you a general explanation of its use and origins.


**Suffix -rican:**

/ˈrɪkən/ | suffix |  (构成地名及民族名称的后缀) |  This suffix is used to create adjectives and nouns referring to people, languages, or cultures associated with specific regions in the Americas. It's derived from the Latin word "rica" meaning "rich," but its modern use is purely geographical. |  The word is attached to a root to denote origin. For example, "American" means relating to America. |  N/A (not a standalone word) | N/A (not a standalone word) | N/A (not a standalone word)



**Etymology:**

The suffix "-rican" ultimately traces back to the Latin word *rīca*, meaning "rich" or "wealthy".  However, this semantic connection is largely lost in its modern usage.  The suffix evolved through Romance languages (possibly Spanish or Portuguese) and became attached to place names in the Americas, denoting their connection to the broader region. The emergence of terms like "American" and others cemented its role in identifying people and their origins.

Note that the grammatical features (tense, voice, etc.) apply to the whole word formed by using the "-rican" suffix, not the suffix itself.  The examples above show the noun and adjective uses of words ending in "-rican".  Further grammatical analysis would need to consider the full word formed, not the suffix in isolation.
