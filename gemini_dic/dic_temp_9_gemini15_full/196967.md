The word "shahar" is not an English word.  It's likely a word from another language, possibly Hebrew (שחר).  Therefore, a full English word analysis as requested is not possible.  To provide the requested information, I need the language of origin.

If "shahar" is indeed Hebrew, then:

/ʃaˈχar/ | n. | 黎明，拂晓 | Dawn, daybreak.  It refers to the early morning, the time just before sunrise. |  The shahar brought with it a cool breeze. (拂晓带来了凉爽的微风。) The birds sang as the shahar approached. (鸟儿在黎明来临时歌唱。) |  sunrise, daybreak | night, dusk, evening


USAGE->  (This section would require illustrative Hebrew sentences and their English translations, which is beyond the scope without knowing the grammatical context in Hebrew.)


PHRASE-> (Hebrew phrases using "shahar" would need to be provided and translated.)
