The word "renable" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage examples are impossible to provide.  To assist you, I need clarification:

* **Is this a misspelling?**  Could you be thinking of a similar word, perhaps "enable," "rename," or another word entirely?
* **Is this a neologism (newly coined word)?** If so, in what context did you encounter it?  Knowing the context would help determine its intended meaning.

If you can provide more information, I can offer a more accurate response.
