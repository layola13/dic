WORD ORIGIN->

The word "melancholy" comes from the Greek words *melas* (μέλας), meaning "black," and *kholē* (χολή), meaning "bile."  Ancient Greek humoral theory posited that an imbalance of the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) affected a person's temperament.  An excess of black bile was believed to cause melancholy.  The word entered English through Old French.
