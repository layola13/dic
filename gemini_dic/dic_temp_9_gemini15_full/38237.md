词源:
The word "computerised" is derived from "computer" + "-ised".  "-ised" is a suffix used to form adjectives and verbs, indicating that something is made or becomes something else.  The root "computer" itself has a complex history, tracing back to the 17th century use of the word to describe a person who performs calculations.  The modern electronic meaning developed through the evolution of calculating machines.
