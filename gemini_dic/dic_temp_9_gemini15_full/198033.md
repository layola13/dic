词源:  The word "shoddy" ultimately derives from the Old English word "sceadan," meaning "to separate" or "to divide." In the 18th and 19th centuries, "shoddy" referred to a type of recycled wool made from the waste fibers of cloth manufacturing.  This recycled wool was often of inferior quality, leading to the word's current meaning.
