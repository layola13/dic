词源:

The word "entertainable" is derived from the verb "entertain," which itself comes from the Old French "entretenir," meaning "to hold, keep, maintain."  The prefix "en-" is from Latin, intensifying the meaning. "-tain" comes from the Latin "tenēre," meaning "to hold."  Over time, "entertain" evolved to encompass the meaning of providing amusement or hospitality. The suffix "-able" transforms the verb into an adjective, signifying something capable of being entertained or providing entertainment.
