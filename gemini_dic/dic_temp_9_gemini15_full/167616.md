词源:
The word "preyful" is derived from the noun "prey," meaning an animal hunted and killed by another for food, combined with the suffix "-ful," which typically indicates "full of" or "characterized by."  Thus, "preyful" literally means "full of prey" or "characterized by the act of preying."  Its usage reflects a transition from a literal sense of hunting prey to a metaphorical sense of aggressively seeking something desired.
