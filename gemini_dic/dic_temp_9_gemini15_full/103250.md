词源:

The word "jeweling" comes directly from the noun "jewel,"  meaning a precious stone.  The "-ing" suffix transforms it into a gerund (verbal noun) describing the action of setting or working with jewels.  The word's history is ultimately connected to the Old French "jouel," and further back to the Latin "jocale," meaning "plaything" or "toy," reflecting the initially decorative and playful nature of jewels.
