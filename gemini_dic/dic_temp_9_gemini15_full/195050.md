词源:
The word "semibarbarian" is a combination of the prefix "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partly") and the noun "barbarian."  "Barbarian" originates from the ancient Greek word "βάρβαρος" (barbaros), which originally referred to non-Greek speakers whose languages sounded like "bar-bar" to the Greeks. Over time, it took on the meaning of "uncivilized" or "savage."
