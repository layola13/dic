situationalism:/ˌsɪtʃuˈeɪʃənəlɪzəm/| n. |情境主义；情境决定论 |The philosophical and sociological theory that emphasizes the importance of social and environmental contexts in shaping individual behavior and experience.  It argues that behavior is determined more by immediate situational factors than by enduring personality traits or internal dispositions.  | Example:  Situationalism argues that a person's honesty is not a fixed trait, but rather depends on the specific circumstances they find themselves in.  情境主义认为一个人的诚实不是一个固定的特质，而是取决于他们所处的具体环境。

| Example:  The study demonstrated the power of situationalism by showing how easily people could be induced to behave in ways that contradicted their self-perceived morality. 这项研究通过展示人们很容易被诱导做出与他们自认为的道德相悖的行为，证明了情境主义的力量。|近义词：contextualism, environmentalism (in this specific sense)|反义词：dispositionalism, internalism|名词
