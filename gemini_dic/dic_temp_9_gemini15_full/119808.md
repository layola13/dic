mikado:/mɪˈkɑːdoʊ/| n. |天皇，日式游戏|The word "mikado" refers to the Emperor of Japan.  It is now largely considered an outdated or even offensive term, as it was often used by Westerners in a condescending or exoticizing manner. The word's usage reflects a historical Western perspective on Japan, often lacking nuance and respect for Japanese culture and sovereignty.  It's preferable to use more appropriate and respectful terms like "Emperor" or "Tenno" (天皇).  In the context of the game, it refers to a children's game involving small sticks.  |Example: The old stories often portrayed the Mikado as an all-powerful figure. = 老故事常常把天皇描绘成一个权力至上的形象。The children played a game of mikado. = 孩子们玩了一场天皇游戏。|近义词：Emperor, Tenno (天皇)|反义词：subject, commoner|名词
