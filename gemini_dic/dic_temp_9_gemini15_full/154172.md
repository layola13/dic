词源:  The word "periodicalism" is a relatively modern coinage, formed by combining "periodical" (meaning something published at regular intervals) with the suffix "-ism," which denotes a system, practice, or doctrine.  The word thus directly reflects the systematic nature of the publishing industry focused on periodicals.
