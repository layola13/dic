词源:

The word "preeligibility" is a compound word formed from the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the noun "eligibility" (meaning "the state or quality of being eligible").  "Eligibility" itself comes from the Middle English word "eligible," derived from the Old French "eligible," ultimately from the Latin "eligere" (to choose, select).  Therefore, "preeligibility" literally means "before eligibility," referring to the process that occurs *before* determining if someone or something is eligible.
