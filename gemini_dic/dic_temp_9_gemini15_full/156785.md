piezometer:/ˌpiːˈzɒmɪtər/ | n. | 测压计 | A piezometer is a device used to measure fluid pressure at a specific point within a fluid body, typically in porous media like soil or rock. It consists of a small-diameter tube open at both ends, with one end inserted into the fluid and the other end exposed to the atmosphere. The height of the fluid column in the tube indicates the pressure at the point of measurement.  | Example:  Engineers used a piezometer to monitor the pore water pressure during the construction of the dam.  工程师们在建造水坝期间用测压计监测孔隙水压力。 |近义词：pressure gauge, manometer |反义词：无
