词源:
The word "overlatenesses" is formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to the word "overlateness."  "-nesses" is a noun suffix indicating a plural or a state of being. "Overlateness" itself is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessive or beyond) and "lateness" (the state of being late).  Therefore, "overlatenesses" signifies multiple instances or a condition of excessive lateness.
