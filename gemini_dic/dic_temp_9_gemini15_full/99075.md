interavailable:/ˌɪntərəˈveɪləbəl/| adj.| 可互相使用的；可互相利用的 |  This word is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a very rare, specialized term.  It likely combines "inter-" (meaning between or among) and "available" (meaning able to be used).  A possible meaning could be that resources or items are available to and usable by multiple parties or systems.  There are no standard examples, synonyms, or antonyms due to its non-standard nature.  The word needs more context to understand its intended meaning. |  Example (hypothetical):  "The interavailable databases allowed researchers in different institutions to share data seamlessly." = 可互相使用的数据库允许不同机构的研究人员无缝共享数据。 | 近义词:  N/A (due to lack of standard usage) | 反义词: N/A (due to lack of standard usage) | 词性: adj.
