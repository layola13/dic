The word "meding" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a newly coined word, or a word from a specific dialect or jargon.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  To help you, I need more context where you encountered this word.  For example, tell me the sentence or text where it appeared.
