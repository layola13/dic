The word "scurvily" is derived from the noun "scurvy," which ultimately comes from the Middle English word "scurvy," itself possibly originating from Old Norse "skyrbjǫrgr" or a similar Germanic word.  The meaning evolved from a simple descriptive term for the disease to encompass the characteristics associated with it – weakness, debility, and a generally degraded state.  This led to the figurative usage of "scurvily" to describe behavior that is similarly unpleasant and underhanded.
