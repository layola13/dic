chromatographies:/ˌkroʊməˈtɑːɡrəfiz/ | n. | 色谱法（复数） | Chromatographies are a set of laboratory techniques for the separation of a mixture into its components.  These techniques are based on the different affinities of the components for a stationary phase and a mobile phase. | Example:  Different types of chromatographies, such as gas chromatography and liquid chromatography, are used in analytical chemistry.  不同的色谱法，例如气相色谱法和液相色谱法，都应用于分析化学。 | 近义词：separation techniques, analytical methods | 反义词：None | 名词
