inductive:/ɪnˈdʌktɪv/| adj.|归纳的；诱导的|Relating to or using induction or inductive reasoning.  Inductive reasoning involves drawing general conclusions from specific observations.  It's the opposite of deductive reasoning.|例句：The scientist used an inductive approach to formulate his hypothesis, drawing conclusions from numerous experiments.  科学家使用归纳法来制定他的假设，从多次实验中得出结论。

例句：His inductive argument, based on several specific examples, led to a compelling general conclusion. 他的归纳论证，基于几个具体的例子，得出了一个令人信服的普遍结论。


近义词：inferential, empirical, reasoned

反义词：deductive


词源:  From Latin *inducere "to lead in," from *in- "in" + *ducere "to lead."  The sense shifted from "leading in" to "leading to a conclusion."
