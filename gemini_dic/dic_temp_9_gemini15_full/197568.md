词源:

The word "shelterlessness" is derived from "shelter" + "-less" + "-ness".  "Shelter" comes from Old English *scylter, meaning "protection, cover." "-less" is a suffix indicating absence or lack of something. "-ness" is a suffix forming nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, "shelterlessness" literally means "the state of being without shelter."
