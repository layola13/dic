damselflies: /ˈdæmzɛlˌflaɪz/ | n. | 豆娘 |

英文解析: Damselflies are insects belonging to the order Odonata, suborder Zygoptera.  They are similar in appearance to dragonflies, but are generally smaller and more slender, with their wings held together when at rest. They are often found near water, as their larvae are aquatic.  They are predatory insects, feeding on small flying insects.

例句:
The damselflies were flitting gracefully around the pond.  = 豆娘优雅地在池塘周围飞舞。

The children watched in fascination as a damselfly landed on a reed. = 孩子们着迷地看着一只豆娘停在一根芦苇上。


近义词:  dragonflies (though distinct)


反义词:  None directly applicable.  (One might contrast "damselflies" with non-insect flying creatures, but that's a broad comparison.)


词性: noun (plural)
