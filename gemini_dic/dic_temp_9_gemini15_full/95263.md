词源:
The word "incapabilities" is derived from the word "capable," meaning having the ability to do something.  The prefix "in-" means "not," thus "incapable" means "not capable." The suffix "-ities" denotes a plural noun, creating "incapabilities" to represent multiple instances of lacking ability.  The word's roots trace back to the Latin word "capax," meaning "capable" or "roomy."
