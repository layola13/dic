词源:

The word "maladroitnesses" is derived from the French word "maladroit," which itself is composed of:

* **mal-:**  A prefix meaning "bad" or "ill."
* **adroit:** Meaning "skillful," "clever," or "dexterous."

Therefore, "maladroit" means "unskillful" or "clumsy," and "maladroitnesses" is the plural noun form indicating multiple instances of such behavior.
