词源:
The word "professionalizes" is derived from the noun "professional" and the suffix "-ize," which means "to make or become."  "Professional" itself originates from the Middle English "professione," ultimately from the Latin "professio," meaning "declaration," "avowal," or "open declaration of belief."  The evolution reflects the shift in meaning from a public declaration of faith to a specialized occupation requiring skill and training.
