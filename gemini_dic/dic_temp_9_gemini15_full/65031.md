/ˈiːtəsɪst/| n. |伊塔主义者；主张伊塔字母的人|A person who advocates for the inclusion of the letter eta (η) in the alphabet, particularly in reformed spellings of English.  Etacists believe that the letter eta, representing a distinct sound in some languages, is necessary for clearer and more consistent spelling in English. They often propose using eta to represent a specific vowel sound that is currently represented inconsistently, such as the sound in "late" or "fate".|  The etacist movement, though small, has been advocating for spelling reform for decades. |近义词：spelling reformer, orthographic reformer |反义词：None specifically, but those opposed to spelling reform could be considered antonyms in a broader sense.
