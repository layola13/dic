词源:  The word "countervailing" comes from the prefix "counter-" (meaning "against" or "opposite") and the verb "avail," which ultimately derives from the Old French "availler" (to be of use or value).  The "vail" part relates to value or worth. Thus, "countervailing" means acting against or offsetting something of equal value or force.
