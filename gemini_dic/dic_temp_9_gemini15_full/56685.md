词源:
The origin of "doolally" is uncertain, but the most widely accepted theory links it to the British Army's time in India.  "Doolally" is believed to be a corruption of "Deolali," a town near Mumbai that housed a large British military hospital.  Soldiers who were mentally affected by the heat, stress, and diseases of India were sometimes said to be "suffering from Deolali," which eventually became shortened and altered to "doolally."
