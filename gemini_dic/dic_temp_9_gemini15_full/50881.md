词源:  The term "desert boot" originates from the British company Clarks, which introduced the style in the 1950s.  They were inspired by the footwear worn by British officers serving in North Africa during World War II. The crepe rubber soles provided good grip on the desert sand. The design's simplicity and practicality quickly gained popularity beyond its military origins.  The suede or leather uppers also provided protection from the elements.
