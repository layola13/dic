词源:The word "salami" originates from the Italian word "salam" or "salame," which itself derives from the Latin word "salāmium." This Latin word likely combines "sal" (salt) and a suffix indicating a preserved food item.  The process of salting and curing meat is central to salami production, reflecting its etymology.
