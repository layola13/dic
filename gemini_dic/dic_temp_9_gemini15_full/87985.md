词源:

* **octane:**  From the chemical term "octane," referring to a hydrocarbon with eight carbon atoms.  The word originates from the Greek word  ὀκτώ (oktō), meaning "eight."

* **high-octane:**  The term "high-octane" emerged as a descriptor for gasoline with a higher octane rating, indicating its resistance to knocking (pre-ignition) in internal combustion engines.  This eventually led to the figurative use to describe something powerful, exciting, or intense.
