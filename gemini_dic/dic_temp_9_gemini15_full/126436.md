词源:
The word "mysticities" is derived from the word "mystic," which comes from the Late Latin word "mysticum," meaning "mysterious" or "secret."  The suffix "-ities" forms a plural noun denoting qualities or states.  Therefore, "mysticities" refers to the plural of mysterious qualities or states, or instances of mystery.
