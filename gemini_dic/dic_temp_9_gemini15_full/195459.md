/ˌsɛmiˌɒbdʒɛktɪvnəsɪz/ | n. | 半客观性；半客观的事物 |  The term "semiobjectivenesses" is not a standard English word found in common dictionaries. It appears to be a newly coined word, likely formed by combining "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partly"), "objective" (meaning "not influenced by personal feelings or opinions"), and the plural suffix "-nesses" (indicating a state or quality).  Therefore, it would likely refer to instances or aspects that are partly objective and partly subjective, a blend of factual information and personal interpretation. There are no standard examples or usages due to its neologistic nature. | 近义词: partial objectivity, quasi-objectivities, mixed perspectives | 反义词: complete subjectivity, pure objectivity |  n.
