isochasmic:/ˌaɪsoʊˈkæzmɪk/| adj. |等震级的；等震区的| Of or relating to lines of equal seismic intensity.  Isochasmic lines connect points of equal seismic intensity on a map.  The term is used in seismology to describe areas experiencing the same degree of shaking from an earthquake.| The isochasmic lines showed a clear pattern of intensity radiating outwards from the epicenter. 等震线显示出从震中向外辐射的清晰强度模式。|近义词：isoseismal|反义词：无


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The isochasmic lines are clearly visible on the map. = 等震线在地图上清晰可见。
This region is isochasmic with the surrounding area. = 这个区域与周围区域的震级相同。


一般过去时:
The seismologists mapped the isochasmic lines after the earthquake. = 地震学家在地震后绘制了等震线图。
The isochasmic map showed the extent of the damage. = 等震线图显示了破坏的程度。


现在完成时:
Scientists have used isochasmic maps to study earthquake patterns. = 科学家们已经使用等震线图来研究地震模式。
Researchers have determined the isochasmic lines for this event. = 研究人员已经确定了这次事件的等震线。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, they had not considered the isochasmic lines. = 在分析之前，他们没有考虑等震线。
The scientists had already mapped the isochasmic lines before publishing their findings. = 科学家们在发表研究结果之前就已经绘制了等震线图。


将来时:
We will use advanced software to model the isochasmic lines. = 我们将使用先进的软件来模拟等震线。
They will analyze the isochasmic patterns to understand the earthquake's mechanism. = 他们将分析等震线模式以了解地震的机制。


虚拟语气:
If the isochasmic lines were different, the damage would have been greater. = 如果等震线不同，破坏程度就会更大。
I wish the isochasmic map was more precise. = 我希望等震线图更精确。


被动语态:
The isochasmic lines were carefully plotted on the map. = 等震线被仔细地绘制在地图上。
The isochasmic data is being analyzed by the research team. = 等震级数据正在由研究小组进行分析。


疑问句:
Where are the isochasmic lines located on this map? = 这张地图上的等震线在哪里？
What do the isochasmic lines tell us about the earthquake's intensity? = 等震线告诉我们关于地震强度的什么信息？


否定句:
The isochasmic lines were not clearly defined in this area. = 在这个区域，等震线没有明确定义。
The study did not accurately predict the isochasmic contours. = 这项研究没有准确预测等震线轮廓。
