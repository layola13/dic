cissoid:/ˈsɪsɔɪd/| n. | 蚌线，蔓叶线 | A cissoid is a curve generated by a circle and a line.  Specifically, it's the locus of points such that the distance from a point on the curve to a fixed point (the pole) is equal to the distance from that point to a fixed line (the directrix).  The shape resembles a heart or ivy leaf, hence the name. | The cissoid of Diocles is a famous example of this type of curve, used in ancient Greece to solve the problem of doubling the cube. | 近义词： none (highly specific curve) | 反义词： none (highly specific curve)
