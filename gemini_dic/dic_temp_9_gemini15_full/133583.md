/nɒnfætʃʊlənsɪz/ | n. | 非放屁 |  The word "nonflatulences" is a humorous and nonsensical neologism. It's formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "flatulences," the plural of "flatulence," which refers to the expulsion of gas from the bowels. Therefore, "nonflatulences" literally means "the absence of flatulence" or "not passing gas."  There is no established meaning or usage in standard English.  It's primarily used for comedic or satirical effect, often to highlight the absurdity of focusing on such a trivial aspect. |  Example: "The doctor assured me that the complete absence of  nonflatulences was nothing to be concerned about."
