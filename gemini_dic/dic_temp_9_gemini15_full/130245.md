The word "non-Spanishes" does not exist in standard English.  It appears to be a non-standard or invented word, possibly attempting to create a negation of "Spaniards" or something related to Spain.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible as it lacks established meaning and usage.  To provide a response in the requested format would be misleading.
