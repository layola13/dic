词源:

Dictatorialness derives from the word "dictatorial," which in turn comes from the Latin word "dictator."  A dictator in ancient Rome was a magistrate appointed during times of emergency with absolute power.  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun, signifying the quality or state of being dictatorial.
