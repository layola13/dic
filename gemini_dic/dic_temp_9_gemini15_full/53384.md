词源:  The word "disagreement" is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of"), the verb "agree" (meaning "to be of the same opinion"), and the suffix "-ment" (meaning "the act of" or "the state of").  Therefore, "disagreement" literally means "the state of not agreeing."  The root "agree" traces back to Old French "agreer" and ultimately to Latin "ad-" (to) + "gradus" (step, degree), reflecting the sense of coming to a common level or understanding.
