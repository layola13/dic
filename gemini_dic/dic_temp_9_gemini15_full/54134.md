词源：

The word "disenfranchised" comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of"), "en-" (a prefix indicating "to put into" or "to cause to be"), "franchise" (meaning "the right to vote or participate in political processes"), and the suffix "-ed" (indicating the past participle).  Therefore, "disenfranchised" literally means "to have been deprived of the right to franchise."  The word "franchise" itself has roots in Old French and ultimately Latin, relating to freedom and liberty.
