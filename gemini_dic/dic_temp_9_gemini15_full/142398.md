orthotropy:/ɔːrˈθɒtrəpi/| adj.|正交异性，正交各向异性|Having different properties in different directions.  This is particularly relevant in materials science, where it describes materials exhibiting different properties (e.g., strength, stiffness) along different axes.  For example, wood is orthotropic because its properties are different along the grain, across the grain, and radially.|Example: The orthotropic nature of the composite material allowed for tailored stiffness in specific directions.|近义词：anisotropy (in a specific directional context)|反义词：isotropy
