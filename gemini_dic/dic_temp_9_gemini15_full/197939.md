词源:


The word "shitload" is a compound of "shit" (a vulgar term for feces) and "load" (a quantity or amount). Its use as a slang term for a large quantity likely arose in the latter half of the 20th century.  The exact origin is difficult to pinpoint, as it developed organically within informal speech.
