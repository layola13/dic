词源:
The word "curst" is the past participle of the verb "curse," meaning to invoke evil or misfortune upon someone or something.  It evolved from Old English "cursian," and is related to the Latin word "currere," meaning "to run," suggesting the idea of a curse running its course.  The adjective use of "curst" reflects the lasting impact of a curse, leading to the secondary meaning of ill-tempered or unfortunate.
