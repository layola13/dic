词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "almost," or "like."
* **intolerable**: From "in-" (not) + "tolerable" (able to be endured).  "Tolerable" ultimately derives from Latin *tolerare* (to endure, bear).

Therefore, "quasi-intolerable" literally means "almost not able to be endured."
