invitrifiable: /ˌɪnˈvɪtrɪfaɪəbl/ | adj. |  不可玻璃化的 |  Incapable of being vitrified; not susceptible to vitrification.  Vitrification is a process that transforms a material into a glass-like or amorphous solid state, typically through heating and cooling.  Therefore, "invitrifiable" describes something that cannot undergo this transformation. |  The ceramic material proved invitrifiable under the experimental conditions.  这种陶瓷材料在实验条件下证明是不可玻璃化的。|  unvitrifiable | vitrifiable | adj.
