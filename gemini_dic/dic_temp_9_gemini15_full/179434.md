词源:

The word "reduction" comes from the Old French word "reduction," which in turn derives from the Latin word "reductionem," the accusative form of "reductio."  "Reducere" in Latin means "to lead back," "to bring back," or "to restore," implying a return to a previous state or a simpler form. This root captures the core meaning of reduction—a process of bringing something back to a smaller size, simpler form, or lower level.


用法说明:

1.  **减少数量或大小**: This is the most common use. It refers to a decrease in the amount, size, or number of something.  For example: "a reduction in crime," "a reduction of staff," "a price reduction."

2.  **简化或精简**: Reduction can also mean simplifying something complex, making it easier to understand or manage. For example: "the reduction of a complex equation," "a reduction in bureaucracy."

3.  **化学还原**: In chemistry, reduction refers to a chemical reaction that involves the gain of electrons or a decrease in oxidation state.  This is a more specialized meaning.

4.  **缩小规模**:  Reduction can also refer to scaling down the size or scope of an operation or project. For example, "reduction in military spending", "reduction of carbon footprint".
