/nɒnˈwɔːkɪŋz/ | n. | 非步行者；不走路的人 |  The term "nonwalkings" is not a standard English word. It's a newly coined word, likely formed by adding "-ings" to "nonwalking," creating a somewhat awkward plural noun.  It implies a group or collection of entities or people who are not walking.  The word lacks common usage and would be considered informal or unconventional. | Example: (Hypothetical, illustrating potential, non-standard usage)  The study focused on the characteristics of the nonwalkings in the city center during peak hour.  这项研究关注了高峰时段市中心非步行者的特征。 | 近义词: non-pedestrians, those who don't walk, inactive people | 反义词: pedestrians, walkers |  n.
