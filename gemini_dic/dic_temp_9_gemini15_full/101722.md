词源:

The word "irreprovable" comes from the prefix "ir-" (meaning "not"), the word "reprove" (meaning "to rebuke or criticize"), and the suffix "-able" (meaning "capable of being").  Therefore, "irreprovable" literally means "not capable of being reproved."  The root word "reprove" itself comes from Old French *reprover and ultimately from Latin *reprobāre, meaning "to disapprove of".


用法说明：


irreprovable is primarily used as an adjective to describe actions, behavior, or character that is beyond reproach or criticism. It suggests a high level of moral integrity and impeccable conduct.  It's often used in formal contexts.

由于该词本身含义较为正式且强烈，在口语中使用较少。  一般用于书面语或正式场合，描述道德上或行为上无可指摘的事物或人物。
