freudian slips:/ˈfrɔɪdiən slɪps/ | n. | 弗洛伊德式笔误，口误 | An unintentional error in speech, writing, or action that is thought to reveal a subconscious feeling, belief, or desire.  It's often a slip of the tongue, but can also be a mistake in writing or any other action.  The term comes from the psychoanalytic theories of Sigmund Freud, who believed such slips revealed repressed thoughts and feelings. | Example:  Instead of saying "I love you," she said "I love him," revealing her subconscious feelings for another man.  | 近义词: parapraxis, lapsus linguae | 反义词:  intentional act, deliberate statement
