shistose:/ˈʃɪstoʊs/| adj. |千枚岩的；片状的|Having the structure or texture of schist; readily splitting into thin layers.  The term refers to rocks that exhibit a planar fabric, often due to the parallel alignment of platy minerals like mica. This alignment allows the rock to easily cleave along parallel planes.|The metamorphic rock exhibited a distinct shistose texture, easily splitting into thin, flat sheets.|近义词：foliated, laminated, fissile|反义词：massive, unfoliated

The sample displayed a clearly shistose texture. = 样本显示出明显的片状结构。


现在完成时:
Geologists have observed many shistose formations. = 地质学家们已经观察到许多片状岩层。
We have determined that the rock is shistose. = 我们已经确定这块岩石是片状的。


过去完成时:
They had already examined the shistose samples before the presentation. = 他们在报告前已经检查过那些片状样品了。
The researchers had concluded that the formation was shistose in origin. = 研究人员得出结论，该地层起源于片状岩。


将来时:
We will analyze the shistose samples next week. = 我们下周将分析这些片状样品。

虚拟语气:
If the rock were shistose, it would easily split. = 如果岩石是片状的，它很容易劈开。

疑问句:
Is this rock shistose? = 这块岩石是片状的吗？
Are these layers shistose in origin? = 这些岩层是片状成因的吗？


否定句:
The rock is not shistose; it's massive. = 这块岩石不是片状的；它是块状的。
The texture was not shistose, but rather granular. = 结构不是片状的，而是颗粒状的。


PHRASE->
