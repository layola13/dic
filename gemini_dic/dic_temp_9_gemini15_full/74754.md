词源:
The word "freewheeling" combines "free" (meaning unrestricted) and "wheel" (referring to the act of cycling or moving freely).  The "-ing" suffix transforms it into an adjective.  It originated in the context of bicycle technology, referring to a mechanism allowing the bicycle wheels to rotate freely without pedaling, and later broadened to its metaphorical meaning.
