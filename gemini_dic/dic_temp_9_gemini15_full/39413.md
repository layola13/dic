connascence: /ˈkɒnəsəns/ | n. | 内在联系；内聚性；内在一致性 | The inherent connection or interdependence between parts of a system.  It refers to the degree to which elements of a system are bound together. High connascence indicates strong interdependence, making changes more complex and risky. Low connascence promotes modularity and maintainability. | Example: The high connascence between the database and the user interface made it difficult to update the system.  高内聚性使得数据库和用户界面难以更新系统。| 近义词: interdependence, cohesion, coupling | 反义词: independence, decoupling, modularity |


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in software engineering and systems design contexts.  It doesn't have typical verb conjugations like "hello."  Instead, it's used as a noun describing a characteristic of a system.


Example sentences demonstrating varying degrees of connascence:

High Connascence:
The tight connascence between the modules resulted in cascading failures. 模块之间紧密的内聚性导致了级联故障。

The monolithic design, with its high connascence, made refactoring a nightmare.  单体架构，由于其高内聚性，使得重构成为了噩梦。

Low Connascence:
The loosely coupled components exhibited low connascence, facilitating independent development and testing. 松散耦合的组件表现出低内聚性，有利于独立开发和测试。

The modular architecture reduced connascence, simplifying future modifications. 模块化架构降低了内聚性，简化了将来的修改。


PHRASE->
Phrases using "connascence" are mainly technical and focus on its implications within a system's design:

high connascence: 高内聚性
low connascence: 低内聚性
connascence coupling: 内聚性耦合
reduce connascence: 降低内聚性
managing connascence: 管理内聚性


The word "connascence" itself doesn't have common phrases in the same way as common words like "what."  It's a specialized technical term.
