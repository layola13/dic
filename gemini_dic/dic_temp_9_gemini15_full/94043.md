词源:
The word "impartial" comes from the Old French word "impartiel," which combines the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") with "partial" (meaning "biased" or "taking sides").  The root of "partial" traces back to the Latin word "pars," meaning "part."  Thus, "impartial" literally means "not taking sides" or "not favoring a particular part."
