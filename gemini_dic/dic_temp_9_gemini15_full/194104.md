self-impedance: /ˌsɛlfɪmˈpiːdəns/ | n. | 自阻抗 | The opposition to the flow of current within a single component or circuit element.  It's a measure of how much a component resists the flow of current when that current originates within the component itself.  This is different from impedance, which considers external current sources. | Example: The self-impedance of the coil was measured using a bridge circuit.  这个线圈的自阻抗是用桥式电路测量的。|近义词: internal impedance |反义词:  None (it's not a concept with a direct opposite)

They did not consider the effects of the self-impedance in their model. = 他们在模型中没有考虑自阻抗的影响。


PHRASE->
self-impedance measurement = 自阻抗测量
self-impedance matching = 自阻抗匹配
high self-impedance = 高自阻抗
low self-impedance = 低自阻抗
self-impedance analysis = 自阻抗分析

词源:
The word "self-impedance" is a compound word.  "Self" indicates that the impedance is internal to the component itself. "Impedance" comes from the Latin "impedire," meaning "to hinder" or "to obstruct," reflecting its role in resisting current flow.
