The word "preinvents" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, or perhaps a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis following your requested format is impossible.

To help you, I can offer some possibilities:

* **It might be a misspelling:**  Perhaps the intended word was "pre-invents,"  "preinventions," or a similar word related to invention.

* **It might be a newly coined technical term:** In a highly specialized field, a new word might be created.  If you encountered this word in a specific context, providing that context would be helpful.

* **It might be a deliberate creation:**  Someone might have made up the word for a specific purpose, such as in fiction or a creative project.


If you can provide more context (the sentence where you found it, the subject matter), I might be able to offer a more informed analysis or guess at the intended meaning.
