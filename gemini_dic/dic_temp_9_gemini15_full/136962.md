词源:
The word "nonspectacular" is formed by adding the negative prefix "non-" to the adjective "spectacular."  "Spectacular" ultimately derives from the Latin word "spectaculum," meaning "a sight, show, spectacle."  Thus, "nonspectacular" literally means "not a spectacle" or "not impressive as a sight or show."
