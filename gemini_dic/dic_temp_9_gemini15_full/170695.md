近义词： ambidextrous (but with the implication of lesser skill in the non-dominant hand), ambisinister (if the lesser-skilled hand is the left)

反义词： completely left-handed, completely right-handed, clumsy, uncoordinated


词源:

* **pseudo-:**  From Greek *pseudēs*, meaning "false" or "lying."
* **ambi-:** From Latin *ambi*, meaning "both" or "around."
* **dexter-:** From Latin *dexter*, meaning "right" (as in right hand).
* **-ous:**  A suffix forming adjectives, often indicating "full of" or "having the qualities of."

Therefore, "pseudoambidextrous" literally means "falsely both right-handed,"  implying a deceptive or incomplete ambidexterity.  Note that the "dexter" root here isn't necessarily implying that the dominant hand is the right hand; rather, it is the etymological foundation of the word "ambidextrous".  The "pseudo" prefix is what conveys the insincerity of the ambidexterity.
