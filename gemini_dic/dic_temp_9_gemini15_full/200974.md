词源:  The word "slo-mos" is a shortened, informal plural form of "slow motion."  "Slow" comes from Old English *slow, meaning "dull, sluggish," and "motion" comes from Old French *mocioun, from Latin *motus, meaning "a moving."  The "-mos" ending represents a pluralization, treating "slow-mo" as a single unit.
