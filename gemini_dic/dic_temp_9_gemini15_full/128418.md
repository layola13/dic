词源:  The word is a combination of "new" and "fangleness," with "fangleness" being an older word meaning "something new or novel."  "Fangle" itself comes from Old English *fangol, meaning "a thing that is caught, a trifle, a toy."  This older meaning has largely disappeared from modern English, leaving "newfangleness" as the primary surviving form.
