/hælfˈsaɪtɪdnɪsn̩sɪz/ | n. | 半盲; 半视力 | The word "halfsightedness's" is not a standard English word. It appears to be an incorrect or unconventional formation.  It seems to be attempting to represent the possessive form of "halfsightedness," a term not commonly used.  "Halfsightedness" itself would refer to impaired vision, but lacks common usage. A more appropriate term might be "low vision" or a description specifying the nature of the visual impairment. There are no standard usages, synonyms, or antonyms for this non-standard word.  Because it's not a real word, providing grammatical examples is impossible.
