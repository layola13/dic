词源：

The word "dilutedly" is derived from the adjective "diluted," which comes from the verb "dilute."  "Dilute" originates from the Latin word "dilutus," the past participle of "diluo," meaning "to wash away, to dissolve, to dilute."  The "-ly" suffix is added to form the adverbial form, indicating manner.
