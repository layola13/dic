词源:
The word "reappropriated" is formed from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back"), the verb "appropriate" (meaning "to take possession of," "to set apart for a specific purpose"), and the past participle suffix "-ed".  The meaning has evolved to encompass the deliberate act of taking something and giving it a new, often subversive or challenging, meaning.
