词源:  The word derives from the adjective "exquisite," which comes from the Old French word "exquisit," meaning "searched out," "choice," or "select."  This ultimately traces back to the Latin word "exquisitus," a past participle of "exquirere," meaning "to seek out," "to search thoroughly," or "to investigate carefully."  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner or way in which something is done.
