The word "rousements" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a detailed analysis with pronunciation, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure field.

If you could provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer some educated guesses about its intended meaning or possible origins.
