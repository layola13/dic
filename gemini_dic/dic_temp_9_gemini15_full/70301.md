词源：源自动词fidget，意思是“坐立不安，烦躁”。后缀-ingly表示方式或状态。  The word derives from the verb "fidget," which in turn has uncertain origins, possibly related to Old English words suggesting movement or restlessness.  The suffix "-ingly" transforms the verb into an adverb, indicating the manner in which an action is performed.
