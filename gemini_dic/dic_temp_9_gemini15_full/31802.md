词源:  The word "checkmate" comes from the Old French phrase "échec et mat," which literally translates to "check and mate."  "Échec" is from the Persian "shah," meaning "king," and "mat" comes from the Arabic "māt," meaning "dead" or "helpless."  Thus, the original meaning referred to the king being trapped and unable to escape, leading to the end of the game.  The word evolved through Middle English and eventually to its modern form.
