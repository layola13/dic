/priːˈɡɜːrlhʊd/ | n. | 女孩时期，少女时代 | The period of time before a girl becomes a woman, often emphasizing the experiences and perspectives unique to this stage.  It is distinct from childhood in its focus on the development towards womanhood and the associated social, emotional, and physical changes. |  She documented her pregirlhood experiences in her memoir, focusing on the subtle shifts in her understanding of gender roles. 她在她回忆录中记录了她少女时代之前的经历，重点是她对性别角色理解的微妙转变。


The word "pregirlhood" is a relatively new coinage, formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") with the noun "girlhood."  There is no established etymology beyond this straightforward combination, as it's not a word found in traditional dictionaries.  Its usage reflects a growing interest in exploring the nuanced experiences of girls before they are fully considered "girls" in the traditional sense. It implies a stage of development preceding the typically understood social and cultural markers of girlhood.
