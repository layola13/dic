In linguistics, it refers to the ability of certain grammatical elements (like prefixes or suffixes) to be separated from the word they modify. |例句：The separability of concerns in software design is crucial for maintainability. 软件设计中关注点分离对于可维护性至关重要。

The separability of the prefix "un-" from the word it modifies is a feature of English morphology.  前缀“un-”与其修饰词的可分离性是英语形态学的特征。

词源:  Separability derives from the verb "separate" (from Old French *separer, from Latin separāre "to separate, put apart," from se- "apart" + parāre "to prepare, make ready").  The suffix "-ability" indicates the capacity or capability of being separated.
