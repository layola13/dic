isobarism:/aɪˈsoʊbərɪzəm/ | n. | 同重线现象；同量异位现象 | The coexistence of two or more nuclides with the same mass number but different atomic numbers.  Isobarism is a phenomenon observed in nuclear physics where different atomic nuclei can have the same mass number (total number of protons and neutrons) but different atomic numbers (number of protons). This means they have the same total number of nucleons but a different number of protons and neutrons. | Example:  Carbon-14 (⁶C) and Nitrogen-14 (⁷N) are isobars, both having a mass number of 14 but different atomic numbers (6 and 7 respectively).  碳14（⁶C）和氮14（⁷N）是同量异位素，两者质量数均为14，但原子序数不同（分别为6和7）。|近义词: isotopic isomerism (less common)|反义词: N/A
