词源:

The word "incorporealities" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), "corporeal" (meaning "relating to the body; physical"), and the suffix "-ities" (meaning "the state or quality of").  Therefore, it literally means "the state or quality of not being corporeal," or "the state of being non-physical."
