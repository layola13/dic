词源:
The word "perfectionism" is derived from the word "perfect," which comes from the Latin word "perfectus," meaning "completed," "finished," or "brought to an end."  The suffix "-ism" denotes a doctrine, system, or practice.  Therefore, perfectionism literally means the doctrine or practice of striving for perfection.
