phosphorized: /ˈfɒsfəraɪzd/ | adj. | 磷化的；用磷处理过的 | Treated with phosphorus or a phosphorescent substance.  The process often enhances certain properties, like luminescence or flame retardancy. | 例句：The phosphorized coating on the screen made the images appear brighter.  磷化涂层使屏幕上的图像看起来更亮。

The phosphorized steel is more resistant to corrosion. 磷化钢材更耐腐蚀。


近义词：phosphorescent (if referring to luminescence), treated, coated


反义词：unphosphorized


词源:  The word "phosphorized" is derived from "phosphorus" + "-ized," a suffix indicating a process of being treated with or converted into something.  Phosphorus, in turn, originates from the Greek words "phos" (light) and "phoros" (bearing), reflecting its historical association with glowing substances.
