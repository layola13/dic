词源：
The word "demesnes" comes from the Old French word "demeine," which itself originates from the Latin word "dominium," meaning "ownership" or "dominion."  The shift from "dominium" to "demeine" reflects the evolution of the language through Norman French influence on English.  The plural form "demesnes" maintains a connection to its Latin and French roots.
