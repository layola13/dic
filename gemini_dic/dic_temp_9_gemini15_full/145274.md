词源:

The word "overbookishness" is derived from "overbook" + "-ishness."

* **overbook:**  This verb itself is a compound word formed from "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and "book" (referring to making a reservation or recording something in a book).

* **-ishness:** This suffix is used to create nouns that mean "the quality or state of being" something, often implying an excessive or undesirable degree of the quality.  Examples include "selfishness," "childishness," and "foolishness."


Therefore, "overbookishness" literally describes the state or quality of being excessively booked, implying a negative consequence due to this excess.
