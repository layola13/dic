The word "fingens" is not a recognized word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries or etymology resources.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please double-check the spelling.  Perhaps you meant a word like "fingers," "fringes," or something else entirely.

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, a slang term within a specific community, or a word from a fictional language.  If this is the case, more context is needed to understand its meaning and usage.

3. **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a name or place name.
