词源:

The word "distracter" is derived from the verb "distract," which originates from the Old French word "distraire," meaning "to draw away," "to divert," or "to pull apart."  "Distraire" itself is composed of the prefix "dis-" (away, apart) and "traire" (to draw).  The "-er" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, denoting an agent or thing that performs the action.
