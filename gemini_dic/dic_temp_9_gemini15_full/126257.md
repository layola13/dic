myelin:/ˈmaɪəlɪn/ | n. |髓鞘；髓磷脂 | A fatty white substance that forms a sheath around the axons of many neurons, serving as an insulator and increasing the speed of nerve impulse transmission.  | Example:  The damage to the myelin sheath can lead to multiple sclerosis. 髓鞘受损可导致多发性硬化症。 |近义词：myelinated sheath |反义词：None.


USAGE->
