/ˌhaɪpərprɑːˈmɪskjuəsnisɪz/ | n. |过度放荡行为的复数形式 |The excessive and indiscriminate pursuit of sexual partners; instances of hyperpromiscuity.  It refers to multiple instances or examples of extremely promiscuous behavior.  This word is extremely rare and largely theoretical; it is unlikely to be encountered in everyday speech or writing.|例句：The study explored the potential societal consequences of widespread hyperpromiscuousnesses.  这项研究探讨了普遍存在的过度放荡行为可能造成的社会后果。


There is no single sentence example that naturally uses this word because of its rarity and unwieldy nature. The word itself is a hyper-formed noun, meaning it's unlikely to appear in common usage.  It's created by adding "-nesses" to "hyperpromiscuous," which already implies multiple instances.  A better approach would be to use the singular "hyperpromiscuity" or to describe the instances of behavior directly.
