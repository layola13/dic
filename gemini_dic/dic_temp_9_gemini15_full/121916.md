词源:
The word "miss" originates from Old French "mes-, mis-" (past participle of "mettre," to put, send), meaning "to send," "to throw," or "to let go." Its evolution into a verb indicating failure to hit a target or reach a destination is natural, as is its development into a sense of longing or regret for someone or something absent.  The noun use, referring to an unmarried woman, is a shortening of "mistress."
