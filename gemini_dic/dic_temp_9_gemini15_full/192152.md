词源:
The word "scramble" originates from the Old French word "escambler," meaning "to climb," which in turn comes from the Germanic root "skamban," meaning "to climb or stumble."  The modern English word retains the sense of climbing, but has expanded to include the connotations of hurried, disorganized movement and mixing things up.
