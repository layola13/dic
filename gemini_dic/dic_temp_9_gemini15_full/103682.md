词源:

The word "jolting" comes from the verb "jolt," which ultimately derives from the Middle Dutch word "julten," meaning "to shake" or "to jostle."  This further connects to the Old High German word "julten," with a similar meaning.  The transition from a verb to an adjective ("jolting") reflects the common linguistic process of deriving adjectives from verbs.
