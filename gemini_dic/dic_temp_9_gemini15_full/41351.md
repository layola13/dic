词源:

The word "corinthianize" derives from "Corinthian," referring to the ancient Greek city of Corinth, known for its opulent and elaborate architecture, particularly its distinctive Corinthian order of columns.  The suffix "-ize" indicates "to make or become like."  Therefore, "corinthianize" means to make something resemble the style and lavishness of Corinthian architecture.
