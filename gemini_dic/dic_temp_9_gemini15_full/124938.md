词源:
The noun "muff" meaning a warm hand covering comes from Middle English *moffe, possibly from Old French *mofle ("soft, shapeless mass"). The verb sense, meaning to bungle or mishandle, likely developed from this original meaning, associating a clumsy handling of something with a failure to properly grasp or manage it.  The connection between the two meanings is based on the idea of something being loosely held or handled clumsily.
