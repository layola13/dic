词源:

The term "major league" originates from the structure of professional baseball in the United States and Canada.  Initially, there was a distinction between "major" and "minor" leagues, with the major leagues representing the highest level of professional competition.  The term has since broadened to describe anything of the highest caliber or importance in various contexts.  It's a compound word formed from "major" (meaning important or significant) and "league" (a group of teams competing in a sport).
