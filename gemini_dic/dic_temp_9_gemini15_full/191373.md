词源:  The word "scheduling" is derived from the noun "schedule," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "schedula," a diminutive of "scheda," meaning "leaf" or "scroll."  This refers to the original practice of writing down appointments or tasks on individual slips of paper or parchment.  The "-ing" suffix transforms the noun into a gerund, indicating the action of creating or following a schedule.
