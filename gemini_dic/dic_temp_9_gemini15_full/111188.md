词源:  The word "lithographing" comes from the combination of "litho" (from Greek *λίθος*, *lithos*, meaning "stone") and "graph" (from Greek *γράφειν*, *graphein*, meaning "to write").  The "-ing" suffix indicates the act or process of doing something.  Therefore, lithographing literally means "the process of writing on stone" though it now encompasses metal plates as well.
