词源:
The word "calibrate" comes from the late Middle English word "calibrer," meaning "to measure the bore of a cannon."  This in turn derives from the Medieval Latin word "calibrare," which ultimately comes from the Arabic word "qālib" (قالب), meaning "mold" or "form."  The original meaning thus relates to the standardization of internal diameter, essential for consistent cannon performance, and the concept has expanded to encompass the broader meaning of precise adjustment or measurement.
