词源:  The word "shadeless" is formed by adding the prefix "shade-" (meaning "without") to the noun "less" (meaning "without").  The root is the Old English word "sceadu," meaning "shadow."  The evolution of the word reflects a direct development from its meaning of lacking physical shade to also encompass the idea of lacking concealment or indirectness.
