This request is impossible to fulfill as the provided format is designed for analyzing words with a definition, usage, and phrases.  The input "{ir}" is not a word but a combination of two letters that do not form a standalone word in English.  It's a morpheme (meaningful unit) that appears as a prefix in many words, but it cannot be analyzed in isolation as requested.  To analyze it, we'd need to provide examples of words containing the prefix "ir-" and explain its function.
