词源:
The noun "hoarding" ultimately derives from the Old English word *hord, meaning "treasure," "store," or "hoard."  This evolved into Middle English *hoord and then into the modern English "hoard."  The verb "to hoard" followed a similar path. The sense of "large outdoor advertising board" is a later development, likely due to the large size and the implication of storing (displaying) an advertisement.
