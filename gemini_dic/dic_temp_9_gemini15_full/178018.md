词源:  Derived from "reckless" (adjective), which combines "reck" (meaning "to care" or "to heed," now archaic except in this context) and the suffix "-less" (meaning "without"). Thus, "reckless" means "without care" or "heedless." The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being reckless.  The plural "-es" indicates multiple instances of recklessness.
