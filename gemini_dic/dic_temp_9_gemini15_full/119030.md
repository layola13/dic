methoxyl:/ˈmɛθɒksɪl/| n. |甲氧基|A methoxyl group is a functional group with the formula -OCH₃.  It consists of a methyl group (-CH₃) attached to an oxygen atom, which is then attached to the rest of the molecule.  It's a common substituent in organic chemistry, found in many natural and synthetic compounds.  |Example:  The presence of a methoxyl group in the molecule significantly alters its properties. 甲氧基的存在显著改变了分子的性质。|近义词:methoxy|反义词: N/A |名词
