词源：

The word "nondebatable" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "debatable."  "Debatable" comes from the verb "debate," ultimately from the Old French "debatre" and the Latin "battuere" meaning "to beat."  The sense of "to argue" evolved from the idea of a contest or fight of words.


用法说明：

"Nondebatable" is used to describe something that is so clearly true or evident that it cannot be reasonably challenged or disputed. It is often used in formal contexts to emphasize the certainty of a fact or claim.  The word implies a high degree of certainty and leaves no room for disagreement.  It's a stronger statement than simply "true" or "correct."
