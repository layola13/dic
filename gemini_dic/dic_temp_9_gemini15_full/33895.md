PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "circumterraneous".  The word itself is quite formal and rarely used in everyday language.  Instead, synonyms like "global" or "worldwide" are preferred in most contexts.

词源:
The word is formed from:

* **circum-:**  A prefix meaning "around" or "about."
* **terra:** Latin for "earth."
* **-aneous:** A suffix forming adjectives meaning "pertaining to" or "of the nature of."

Therefore, circumterraneous literally means "pertaining to around the earth."
