词源:

The word "invalidator" is derived from the verb "invalidate," which itself comes from the Latin prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "validus" (meaning "strong," "powerful," or "effective").  Therefore, "invalidate" means "to make not valid," and "invalidator" is the agent noun, referring to the thing or person that performs this action.
