词源:
The word "retrieve" comes from the Old French word "retraire," meaning "to draw back," "to withdraw," or "to take back."  This in turn derives from the Latin prefix "re-" (again) and "trahere" (to draw or pull).  The meaning evolved over time to encompass the act of getting something back, whether physically or figuratively.
