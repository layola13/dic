The word "inust" is not a valid English word.  There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It's possible there's a misspelling or it's a word from a specialized field or a neologism (newly coined word).  If you can provide more context or the intended spelling, a more accurate response can be given.
