词源:
The word "intrinsically" derives from the Latin word "intrinsecus," meaning "within," "inward," or "inside."  The prefix "in-" means "in" or "into," and "trinsicus" is related to "intrinsecus".  Over time, "intrinsecus" evolved into the English word "intrinsic," and the adverbial form "intrinsically" followed.
