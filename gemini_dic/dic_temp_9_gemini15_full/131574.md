noncommutativity:/ˌnɒnkəˌmjuːtəˈtɪvɪti/| n. |非交换性|The property of an operation (such as multiplication of matrices or quaternions) where changing the order of the operands changes the result.  This contrasts with commutative operations, where the order doesn't matter.  For example, in the set of integers, addition is commutative (2 + 3 = 3 + 2), but subtraction is not (2 - 3 ≠ 3 - 2).|Example:  The noncommutativity of matrix multiplication is a fundamental concept in linear algebra.  矩阵乘法的非交换性是线性代数中的一个基本概念。|近义词：non-abelian|反义词：commutativity|名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in mathematical contexts, particularly in abstract algebra and related fields.  There aren't typical verb conjugations or tenses associated with it like with action verbs.  Instead, it describes a property of mathematical operations.


Example sentences illustrating its use:


The group is noncommutative because xy is not always equal to yx. 该群是非交换群，因为xy并不总是等于yx。

The noncommutativity of operators in quantum mechanics leads to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. 量子力学中算符的非交换性导致了海森堡不确定性原理。
