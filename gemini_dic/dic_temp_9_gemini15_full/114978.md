词源:  From Latin *mancipāre, from manus "hand" + capere "to take," implying a formal transfer of ownership, often involving a symbolic handing over.  The original meaning involved the legal transfer of property or persons, particularly the transfer of a slave into the power of a master.  The modern meaning evolved from this, focusing on the act of freeing from legal or social restraints.
