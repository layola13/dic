placentalia:/ˌplæsənˈteɪliə/| n. |胎盘类动物|Placentalia refers to the clade (a group of organisms believed to have evolved from a common ancestor) of mammals that possess a placenta.  This structure allows for the nourishment and support of the developing embryo during gestation.  The placenta facilitates the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the mother and the fetus.  The vast majority of mammals belong to this group. |Example: Humans are members of the placental mammal group, Placentalia. 人类属于胎盘类哺乳动物，即胎盘类。|近义词：Eutheria (sometimes used interchangeably)|反义词：Monotremata, Marsupialia (these are non-placental mammals)
