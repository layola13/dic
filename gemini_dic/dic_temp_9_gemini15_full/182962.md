词源:
The word "replacing" comes from the verb "replace," which is formed from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") and the verb "place" (meaning "to put" or "to locate").  Therefore, "replace" literally means "to put back" or "to put in the place of."  The "-ing" suffix transforms it into the present participle, indicating an ongoing action.
