The word "morak" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical explanation cannot be provided.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A proper noun:** It could be a name (person, place, or thing) specific to a certain region or culture.
* **A word from another language:** It might originate from another language and not be found in standard English dictionaries.  If you can provide the language of origin, I might be able to help.
* **A neologism or slang:**  It could be a newly coined word or slang term not yet widely recognized.


To help me assist you, please provide more context:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (e.g., a book, a conversation, a website)
* **What was the surrounding text or conversation?** This would help determine the meaning and potential origin.


Once you provide more information, I can attempt a more accurate analysis.
