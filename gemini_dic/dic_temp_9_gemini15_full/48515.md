词源:
The word "deerstalkers" is a compound word.  "Deer" refers to the animal, and "stalkers" refers to the act of stalking (quietly following or approaching prey).  The term evolved to describe the high-top boots often worn by those engaged in stalking deer.  The association is primarily with hunting, particularly in Scotland.
