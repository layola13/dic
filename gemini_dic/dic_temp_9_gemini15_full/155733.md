/ˈfoʊniːmz/ /ˈfəʊniːmz/ | n. | 音位 | Phonemes are the smallest units of sound in a language that distinguish one word from another.  They are abstract units, not the actual sounds themselves (phones), which are concrete physical events.  The same phoneme can be realized as different phones depending on the context.  For example, the /p/ in "pin" and "spin" are different phones, but represent the same phoneme. | The English word "bat" has three phonemes: /b/, /æ/, and /t/. |近义词：sound units, speech sounds | 反义词：无
