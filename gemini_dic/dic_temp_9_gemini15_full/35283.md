词源:
The word "clutter" likely originated in the early 16th century, possibly from the Middle Dutch word "klotteren," meaning "to daub" or "to smear."  It evolved to refer to the act of covering something with a thick layer of something else, and eventually transitioned to its modern meaning of a disordered accumulation of things.
