词源:
The word "croquet" comes from the French word "croquet," which itself is of uncertain origin, possibly related to the Old French "croc" meaning "hook" or "crook," referring to the hooked mallets sometimes used in the game.  The food meaning is a later development, likely borrowing the name due to the rounded shape resembling the balls used in the game.
