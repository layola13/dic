phosphite:/ˈfɒsfaɪt/ | n. | 亚磷酸盐 | A salt or ester of phosphorous acid.  Phosphites are used in various applications, including as flame retardants, in agriculture as fertilizers, and in the chemical industry as reducing agents. | Example:  Triphenyl phosphite is a common phosphite ester used as a stabilizer in plastics. 三苯基亚磷酸酯是一种常用的亚磷酸酯，用作塑料的稳定剂。|近义词:phosphate (but with different oxidation state)|反义词: None specifically, but the term contrasts with phosphate (higher oxidation state of phosphorus).|名词
