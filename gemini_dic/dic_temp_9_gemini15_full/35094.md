词源:
The word "clothespress" is a compound word formed from "clothes" and "press".  "Clothes" refers to garments, and "press" in this context derives from the Old French "presse," meaning a press or a chest for storing things.  The combination thus implies a piece of furniture used specifically for pressing and storing clothes.
