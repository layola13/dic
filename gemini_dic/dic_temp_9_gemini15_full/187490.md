词源:
The word "rollercoaster" is a compound word. "Roller" refers to the rolling action of the ride, and "coaster" originally meant a sled or carriage that coasts down a slope.  The word evolved from earlier terms like "Russian Mountains" (referring to early, steep wooden structures) and gradually gained its modern meaning and spelling.
