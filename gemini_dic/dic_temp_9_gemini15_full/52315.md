词源:  The word "dickey" likely originated as a diminutive of "dick," meaning "a man," or possibly related to the Old French word "dic," meaning "a small thing." Its use as a detachable shirtfront or collar emerged in the late 19th century, likely due to its small size and relatively inexpensive nature compared to a whole shirt.  The informal meaning of "cheap or inferior item" is a later development, likely a metaphorical extension of its use as a cheap substitute for a proper shirtfront.
