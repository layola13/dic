The word "nonirrationals" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, likely formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") and "irrationals" (the plural of "irrational," referring to numbers that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers).

Therefore, a full analysis following your requested format is impossible.  However, we can analyze the constituent parts:

**non-**

/nɒn/ | prefix | 非，不 |  Indicates negation or absence. | Example: non-profit (非营利) | 近义词: un-, in-, a- | 反义词:  (depends on the word it prefixes)


**irrationals**

/ˌɪrˈæʃənəlz/ | n. | 无理数 | Numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction (a ratio of two integers).  Examples include π (pi) and the square root of 2. | Example:  Irrational numbers are infinite and non-repeating decimals.  (无理数是无限不循环小数。) | 近义词:  transcendental numbers (先验数，部分无理数属于先验数) | 反义词: rationals (有理数)


If "nonirrationals" were to be used hypothetically, it would likely mean "numbers that are not irrational," therefore implying "rational numbers".  However, this is awkward and unnatural phrasing.  A more appropriate term would be "rationals".

Because "nonirrationals" is not a real word,  I cannot provide usage examples, verb conjugations, or phrases using it.  The sections requesting such information would be left blank or filled with a note explaining the word's non-standard nature.
