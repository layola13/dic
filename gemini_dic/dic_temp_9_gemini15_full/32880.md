chondrigenous: /kɒnˈdrɪdʒɪnəs/ | adj. | 软骨产生的；软骨发生的 |  Producing or formed from cartilage.  The term describes structures or substances originating from or related to cartilage tissue. | Example: Chondrigenous cells are responsible for the formation and maintenance of cartilage.  软骨细胞负责软骨的形成和维持。|  近义词: cartilaginous | 反义词: osseous (bony)
