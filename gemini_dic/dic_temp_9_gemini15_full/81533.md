gravitationally:/ˌɡrævɪˈteɪʃənəli/| adv.|引力地，由于万有引力|Adverb describing something affected by or relating to gravitation.  It indicates that something is happening or is caused by the force of gravity.|The planets move gravitationally around the sun. 行星受万有引力作用围绕太阳运行。|  gravitationally influenced, under gravitational pull| ungravitational (反义词不完全适用，因为引力是客观存在的，无法“反”引力)|副词

USAGE->
