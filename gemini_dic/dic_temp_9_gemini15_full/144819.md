over-immunized: /ˌoʊvərˈɪmjuːnaɪzd/ | adj. |过度免疫的，免疫反应过度的|

英文解析:  Describes a state where the immune system has been stimulated excessively, leading to potential negative consequences. This can be due to excessive exposure to antigens (through vaccination or infection), or an overactive immune response.  It doesn't necessarily mean the individual is immune to everything, but rather that their immune system is reacting in an exaggerated or harmful way.
