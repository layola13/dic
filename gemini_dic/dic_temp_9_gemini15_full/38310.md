词源:

The word "concealedness" is derived from the verb "conceal," which itself has Old French origins.  "Conceal" comes from the Old French word "conceler," meaning "to hide" or "to keep secret."  The suffix "-edness" is a common English suffix that transforms an adjective (in this case, the past participle "concealed") into a noun, indicating a state or quality.
