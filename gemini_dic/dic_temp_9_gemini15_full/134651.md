The word "nonmanagements" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism, likely formed by adding the prefix "non-" to "managements."  Therefore, a full analysis in the requested format is not possible.  However, we can analyze the constituent parts:

**non-**: /nɒn/ | prefix | 非，不 |  Indicates negation or absence. | Example: non-profit (非营利)


**managements**: /ˈmænɪdʒmənts/ | n. | 管理，经营，处理 | The act of managing; the way something is managed; a group of managers. | Example: The company's managements are excellent. (这家公司的管理层很优秀。)


To understand the intended meaning of "nonmanagements," we need context.  It likely refers to activities, processes, or aspects that are *not* related to management or are outside the scope of management.  For example, it might be used to describe aspects of a business that are not directly controlled by management, or tasks not performed by management personnel.

Since it's not a standard word, providing grammar examples, phrases, synonyms, or antonyms in the requested format is impossible.  Its usage would depend entirely on the context in which it's used.  If you provide the sentence where you encountered this word, a more specific interpretation and explanation can be given.
