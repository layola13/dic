词源:
The word "flusteration" is derived from the verb "fluster," which ultimately comes from the Middle Dutch word "flusteren," meaning "to whisper" or "to mutter."  Over time, the meaning shifted to imply a state of nervous confusion or agitation, likely because whispered or muttered speech often accompanies such a state.  The suffix "-ation" is added to create the noun form, indicating the state or condition of being flustered.
