quasi-ignorant:/ˈkwɑːzaɪ ˈɪɡnərənt/| adj.|似是而非的无知，貌似无知| seemingly ignorant; possessing a superficial or incomplete understanding.  This word combines the prefix "quasi-" (meaning "seemingly" or "resembling") with "ignorant" (lacking knowledge or awareness).  It suggests a state of being unaware or uninformed, but in a way that is not entirely genuine or complete.  The person might appear ignorant, but this might be a deliberate act or a result of limited exposure, rather than a true lack of understanding. |例句：His quasi-ignorant questions revealed a lack of genuine curiosity, more a desire to appear engaging than to learn.  他的似是而非的无知问题暴露了他缺乏真正的求知欲，更像是想显得有参与感而不是想学习。

His quasi-ignorant pronouncements on quantum physics were easily refuted by anyone with a basic understanding. 他关于量子物理学的似是而非的断言很容易被任何具有基本理解的人驳斥。|近义词：uninformed, superficially knowledgeable, seemingly clueless |反义词：knowledgeable, erudite, well-informed
