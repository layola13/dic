noninertial:/ˌnɒnɪˈnɜːʃəl/ | adj. |非惯性的|Not moving with constant velocity; accelerating.  A noninertial frame of reference is one that is accelerating.  This means it is either changing speed or changing direction.  Examples include a rotating frame of reference or a frame of reference that is subject to a gravitational field.|The experiment was conducted in a noninertial frame of reference, leading to some unexpected results.  实验是在非惯性参考系中进行的，导致了一些意想不到的结果。|inertial|inertial|

USAGE->

The experiment was designed to minimize the effects of the noninertial environment. = 该实验旨在最大限度地减少非惯性环境的影响。


疑问句:
Is this reference frame inertial or noninertial? = 这个参考系是惯性的还是非惯性的？
Are the observed discrepancies due to the noninertial nature of the system? = 观察到的差异是由于系统的非惯性特性吗？


否定句:
The reference frame is not noninertial; it's inertial. = 参考系不是非惯性的；它是惯性的。
The measurements were not significantly affected by the noninertial effects. = 测量结果没有受到非惯性效应的显著影响。
