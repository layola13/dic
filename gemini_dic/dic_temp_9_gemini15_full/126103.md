mutation:/mjuˈteɪʃən/| n. |突变，变异|A mutation is a change in a DNA sequence.  Mutations can result from errors during DNA replication or from exposure to mutagens such as radiation or certain chemicals. They can be beneficial, harmful, or neutral. |Example:  The genetic mutation caused a significant change in the organism's phenotype.  基因突变导致该生物体的表型发生了显著变化。 The scientists studied the mutations in the virus to understand its evolution. 科学家们研究了病毒的突变以了解其进化。|近义词：alteration, variation, change|反义词：constancy, stability|名词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Mutations occur randomly. = 突变随机发生。
A mutation changes the DNA sequence. = 突变改变DNA序列。


一般过去时:
A mutation occurred during replication. = 在复制过程中发生了一个突变。
The scientists identified a new mutation. = 科学家们鉴定了一个新的突变。


现在完成时:
Several mutations have been identified in this gene. = 在这个基因中已经发现了几个突变。
Researchers have studied the effects of mutations. = 研究人员已经研究了突变的影响。


过去完成时:
The mutation had already occurred before the treatment. = 在治疗之前突变已经发生了。
They had observed similar mutations in previous studies. = 他们在之前的研究中观察到类似的突变。


将来时:
Future studies will investigate the role of this mutation. = 未来的研究将调查这种突变的作用。
Scientists will analyze the mutations to predict the phenotype. = 科学家们将分析突变以预测表型。


虚拟语气:
If a mutation were to occur, it might be harmful. = 如果发生突变，它可能是有害的。
It is unlikely that such a mutation would occur naturally. = 这种突变不太可能自然发生。


被动语态:
The mutation was detected during screening. = 突变在筛查过程中被检测到。
The effects of the mutation are being studied. = 突变的影响正在被研究。


疑问句:
What kind of mutation is this? = 这是什么类型的突变？
How did the mutation arise? = 突变是如何产生的？


否定句:
No significant mutations were found. = 没有发现明显的突变。
This mutation did not affect the protein function. = 这种突变没有影响蛋白质的功能。
