词源:  The word "leaseholds" is a combination of "lease" and "hold". "Lease" comes from Old French "laisser," meaning "to let," "to leave," or "to grant," ultimately from Latin "laxare," meaning "to loosen."  "Hold" comes from Old English "haldan," meaning "to hold," "to keep," or "to possess."  Therefore, "leaseholds" literally means "holdings granted under a lease."
