词源:

The word "hungrier" is derived from the adjective "hungry," which itself has Old English origins.  "Hungry" comes from the Old English word "hungrig," which is a combination of "hungor" (hunger) and the suffix "-ig" (having the quality of). The comparative form "-er" is added to create the comparative adjective "hungrier."
