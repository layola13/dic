英文解析：The word "internecive" describes a conflict or struggle that is destructive to all parties involved.  It implies a situation where the participants inflict damage upon each other to the point of mutual weakening or destruction. The root lies in the Latin "inter" (between, among) and a form related to "necare" (to kill).


例句：

The internecive war devastated the entire region, leaving both sides impoverished and weakened.  =  这场互相残杀的战争摧毁了整个地区，使双方都贫困和虚弱。

The internecive struggle within the company led to its eventual collapse. = 公司内部的互相倾轧导致了它的最终倒闭。


词源：

The word derives from the Latin prefix "inter-" meaning "between" or "among," and a form related to the Latin verb "necare," meaning "to kill."  Thus, the word literally means "killing each other."


用法说明：

"Internecive" is primarily used to describe conflicts and struggles where the damage is reciprocal and self-inflicted by the warring parties. It is a relatively formal and less frequently used word compared to synonyms like "mutually destructive."  It is typically applied to conflicts of significant scale and seriousness.  It's less suitable for describing minor disagreements.
