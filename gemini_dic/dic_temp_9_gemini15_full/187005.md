词源:
The word "rissoles" is derived from the French word "rissoles," which ultimately comes from the older French word "rissole," meaning "a small, fried cake or patty." The word's etymology is somewhat obscure, but it may be related to the Old French word "risseler," meaning "to crisp," suggesting a connection to the frying process involved in making rissoles.  The word entered English through French culinary influence.
