self-quenching: /ˌselfˈkwɛntʃɪŋ/ | adj. | 自熄的，自淬火的 |  Describes a material or process that stops or extinguishes itself without external intervention, typically referring to the cessation of a reaction or fire.  This often involves a process where the heat generated by the reaction is dissipated or absorbed, preventing further reaction. | 例句：The self-quenching mechanism prevents the fire from spreading.  自熄机制防止火势蔓延。


The new fire retardant material is self-quenching and reduces fire risks significantly.这种新型阻燃材料具有自熄性，可显著降低火灾风险。| 近义词：self-extinguishing | 反义词：self-propagating


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The material is self-quenching. = 这种材料是自熄的。

将来时:
The new design will be self-quenching. = 新的设计将是自熄的。
