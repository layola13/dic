词源:
Perdition comes from the Old French word "perdicion," which itself derives from the Latin word "perditio," meaning "destruction," "loss," or "ruin."  The Latin word is formed from the verb "perdere," meaning "to lose" or "to destroy."  The religious connotation of damnation is a later development.
