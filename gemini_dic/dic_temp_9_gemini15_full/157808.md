placodermi: /plækəˈdɜːrmi/ | n. |盾皮鱼类 |Placodermi refers to an extinct class of armored fishes that were dominant in the Devonian period (approximately 419 to 359 million years ago).  They are characterized by their bony plates covering their heads and anterior parts of their bodies.  |  The placoderms were diverse and occupied various ecological niches.  |  近义词: armored fish (less specific) | 反义词:  (no direct antonym, as it refers to an extinct group)
