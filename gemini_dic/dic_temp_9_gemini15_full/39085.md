词源:
The word "confounding" comes from the verb "confound," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "confondre," meaning "to mix up," "to confuse," or "to overwhelm."  The Old French word itself is a combination of the Latin prefix "con-" (meaning "together") and the verb "fundere," meaning "to pour" or "to melt."  Thus, the original sense implied a mixing or merging of things, leading to confusion.
