semi-vitrification:/ˌsemiˌvɪtrɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/| n. |半熔融；半玻璃化|The process by which a material is partially vitrified, meaning it is partially transformed into a glass-like state.  This often involves heating the material to a temperature below its full melting point, causing some, but not all, of the constituent materials to fuse together.  The resulting material exhibits some properties of glass, such as increased hardness and durability, while retaining some characteristics of its original state. | Example: The semi-vitrification of the ceramic tiles increased their resistance to scratching. 半熔融的陶瓷砖提高了它们的抗刮性。|近义词：partial vitrification, partial glazing|反义词：full vitrification, complete melting
