The word "overbaits" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a certain dialect or field.

To help, I need more context. Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the source might help determine its intended meaning and allow for a closer approximation of its analysis.
