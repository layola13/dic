英文解析:The plural form of "nonlogicalness,"  referring to instances or examples of lacking logical consistency or rationality.  It signifies a collection of illogical statements, arguments, or events.

例句:

The committee's report was riddled with nonlogicalnesses, rendering its conclusions unreliable. 委员会的报告充满了非逻辑之处，使其结论不可靠。

His explanation was a series of nonlogicalnesses that failed to convince anyone. 他的解释是一系列不合逻辑之处，无法说服任何人。


词源:

* **non-:**  prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of"
* **logical:**  adjective derived from "logic," relating to reason or sound judgment.
* **-ness:** suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.

因此，"nonlogicalnesses" is formed by combining the prefix "non-", the adjective "logical", and the suffix "-ness", then pluralized.  It literally means "the state or quality of being not logical," specifically referring to multiple instances of such a state.
