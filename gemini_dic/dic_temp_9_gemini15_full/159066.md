pneumoskeleton:/ˈnjuːmoʊˌskɛlətən/| n. |气动骨骼，气囊骨骼|A pneumoskeleton is a type of skeleton found in some animals, particularly certain invertebrates, that is composed of air-filled chambers or sacs.  These chambers provide structural support and buoyancy. Unlike endoskeletons (internal skeletons) or exoskeletons (external skeletons), a pneumoskeleton is an internal structure that derives its rigidity from internal pressure.  The pressure is generated by the animal itself, often through muscular action.  This type of skeletal system is lightweight and allows for greater flexibility and maneuverability.|Example:  The cephalopod's pneumoskeleton,  a modified shell filled with gas, helps it control its buoyancy in the water.|近义词：gas-filled skeleton (though less precise)|反义词：endoskeleton, exoskeleton|名词
