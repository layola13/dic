operators:/ˈɒpəreɪtərz/ /ˈɑːpəreɪtərz/| n. |运算符，操作符，操作员|Symbols or actions that perform mathematical or logical operations.  They are fundamental to programming languages and mathematical notation. For example, +, -, *, / are arithmetic operators.|The program uses the + operator to add two numbers.|近义词：symbol, function, agent|反义词:None.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The operators perform calculations. = 运算符执行计算。
These operators handle data efficiently. = 这些运算符有效地处理数据。

一般过去时:
The operators calculated the results quickly. = 运算符快速计算出结果。
The system used different operators last year. = 系统去年使用了不同的运算符。

现在完成时:
The programmers have implemented new operators. = 程序员已经实现了新的运算符。
We have used these operators extensively. = 我们已经广泛使用了这些运算符。

过去完成时:
They had defined the operators before running the code. = 他们运行代码之前已经定义了运算符。
The system had processed the data using the correct operators. = 系统已使用正确的运算符处理了数据。

将来时:
We will use more complex operators in the next project. = 我们将在下一个项目中使用更复杂的运算符。
The new software will include advanced operators. = 新软件将包含高级运算符。

虚拟语气:
If we had different operators, the results might be different. = 如果我们有不同的运算符，结果可能会有所不同。
It would be beneficial if we could combine these operators. = 如果我们可以组合这些运算符，那将是有益的。

被动语态:
The calculations were performed by the operators. = 计算是由运算符执行的。
The data is being processed by the operators efficiently. = 数据正在被运算符高效地处理。

疑问句:
What operators are used in this equation? = 这个等式中使用了哪些运算符？
Which operators are most efficient for this task? = 对于这项任务，哪些运算符最有效率？

否定句:
The program does not use logical operators. = 该程序不使用逻辑运算符。
This system doesn't support these specialized operators. = 此系统不支持这些专用运算符。


PHRASE->
logical operators = 逻辑运算符
arithmetic operators = 算术运算符
