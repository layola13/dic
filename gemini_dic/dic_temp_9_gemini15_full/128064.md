词源:  The word "nerveless" is formed from the word "nerve" + "-less," a suffix indicating lack or absence.  "Nerve," in this context, refers to both physical nerves and mental fortitude or courage.  The word's origins trace back to the Latin word "nervus," meaning "sinew" or "nerve."  The evolution reflects the historical understanding of nerves as the source of both physical sensation and emotional response.
