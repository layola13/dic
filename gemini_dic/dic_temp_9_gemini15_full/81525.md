词源:
The verb "gravitate" comes from the noun "gravity," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "gravitas," meaning "weight" or "heaviness."  The figurative use of "gravitate" to mean "to be drawn toward" reflects the sense of being pulled or attracted by an unseen force, similar to the way gravity pulls objects toward the earth.
