词源:
The word "interloper" comes from the Middle English "interloper," which itself is derived from the Old French "entre" (between) and "louper" (to leap, skip, or miss).  The original meaning suggested someone who jumped or leaped into a place or situation unexpectedly or without permission. Over time, the meaning evolved to focus on the act of unauthorized intrusion and interference.
