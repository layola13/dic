/ˈdeɪtəblɛsnɪsəz/ | n. | 数据能力；数据性；可数据化程度 | The term "datablenesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, likely formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to "datable," which itself is derived from "data."  The intended meaning seems to be the extent to which something can be converted into, or is suitable for, data analysis.  It suggests a plural concept, referring to multiple aspects or qualities related to data conversion or suitability.  There is no established dictionary definition or widespread usage.  Therefore, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage is impossible without making assumptions about the intended meaning.  To use this word effectively, you would need to define it explicitly within the context of your writing. |  (No example sentence can be provided due to the word's non-standard nature.) | (No synonyms or antonyms exist because it's not a recognized word.) | n.
