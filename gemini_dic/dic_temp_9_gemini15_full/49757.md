词源:
The word "demolisher" is derived from the verb "demolish," which comes from the Old French word "demolir," meaning "to throw down," "to pull down," or "to destroy."  The Old French word itself is a combination of "de-" (meaning "from" or "off") and "molir" (meaning "to grind" or "to crumble").  Thus, the word's roots trace back to the act of breaking something down into smaller pieces.
