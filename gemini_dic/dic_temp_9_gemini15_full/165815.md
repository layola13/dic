preobtruding: /ˌpriːəʊˈtruːdɪŋ/ | adj. | 突出；向前突出的 | Projecting or jutting out; protruding beforehand or excessively.  This word is extremely rare and not found in standard dictionaries. It's likely a newly coined word or a misspelling.  It combines "pre-" (before) and "protruding" (sticking out).  Therefore, it suggests something that is protruding *before* something else or protruding to an excessive degree. |  *Example:* The preobtruding  teeth caused him considerable discomfort. (This sentence uses the word hypothetically to illustrate its potential meaning. The sentence structure could be improved.) | 近义词: protruding, projecting, jutting, prominent | 反义词: recessed, indented, concave
