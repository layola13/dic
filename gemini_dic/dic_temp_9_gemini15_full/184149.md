词源:
The word "resist" comes from the Old French word "resistor," which is derived from the Latin word "resistere," meaning "to stand back, to oppose."  The prefix "re-" means "back" or "against," and the root "-sistere" is related to "stare," meaning "to stand."  Therefore, the word literally means "to stand against."
