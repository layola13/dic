semidefinitenesses:/ˌsɛmiˈdɛfɪnɪtnəsɪz/| n. |半正定性(复数)|The plural of "semidefiniteness," referring to the property of a matrix (or operator) being positive semidefinite or negative semidefinite.  This property implies that all eigenvalues are non-negative (for positive semidefiniteness) or non-positive (for negative semidefiniteness).|The research paper explores various aspects of semidefinitenesses in optimization problems.|positive definiteness, negative definiteness|indefiniteness|名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in mathematical contexts, specifically within linear algebra and optimization.  Therefore, grammatical examples in typical tenses are less relevant than its application within mathematical proofs and theorems.  Instead, here are examples showing its use in different mathematical contexts:

Example 1 (Theorem Statement):
"The conditions for the existence of a solution involve the semidefinitenesses of certain matrices derived from the system's parameters." = "解的存在条件涉及到从系统参数导出的某些矩阵的半正定性。"


Example 2 (Proof):
"By showing that the Hessian matrix possesses only non-negative eigenvalues, we establish the semidefinitenesses required for convexity." = "通过证明Hessian矩阵只拥有非负特征值，我们建立了凸性所需的半正定性。"


Example 3 (Discussion):
"Different types of semidefinitenesses lead to different solution properties; for instance, positive semidefiniteness guarantees a minimum, whereas negative semidefiniteness indicates a maximum." = "不同类型的半正定性导致不同的解性质；例如，半正定性保证最小值，而半负定性则表示最大值。"


PHRASE->
This word does not typically appear in phrases outside of mathematical or technical contexts.  Phrases would generally involve the terms "positive semidefiniteness" and "negative semidefiniteness" rather than the plural "semidefinitenesses".
