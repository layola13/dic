词源:
The word "heartened" comes from the Middle English word "herten," meaning "to encourage" or "to strengthen."  This in turn derives from the Old English word "heorte," meaning "heart."  The modern usage reflects the idea that encouragement comes from a feeling of strength and hope within the heart.
