词源：
The word "establishing" comes from the verb "establish," which originates from the Old French word "establir," meaning "to set up, to found, to settle."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "stabilis," meaning "firm, stable."  The "-ing" suffix indicates the present participle form of the verb, denoting an ongoing action.
