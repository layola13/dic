词源:
The origin of "diddle" is uncertain, but it likely evolved from a combination of onomatopoeic and imitative elements, possibly related to the sound of light, quick movements or manipulations.  Its meaning has shifted over time, from a relatively innocuous sense of light tapping or playing to its current more negative connotations of wasting time or cheating.
