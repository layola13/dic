词源:
The word "picarian" is derived from "picaro," a Spanish word meaning "rogue" or "rascal."  The term originates from the genre of picaresque literature, which features the adventures of a roguish, often impoverished, but clever protagonist.  The adjective form "picarian" then emerged to describe the characteristics of such a character – mischievous, cunning, and often morally ambiguous.
