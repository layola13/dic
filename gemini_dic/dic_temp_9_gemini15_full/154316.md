perityphlitis: /ˌpɛrɪtaɪpˈflaɪtɪs/ | n. |阑尾周围炎|Inflammation of the tissues surrounding the appendix.  This condition is often associated with appendicitis, but can also occur independently.  It can present with similar symptoms to appendicitis, including abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. However, the pain may be less localized than in appendicitis. Diagnosis typically involves physical examination, blood tests, and imaging studies such as ultrasound or CT scan. Treatment may involve antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery to drain abscesses or remove the appendix.|Example: The patient presented with perityphlitis, requiring immediate surgical intervention to prevent further complications.  |近义词: para-appendicitis, appendiceal abscess|反义词: None directly opposite, but absence of inflammation could be considered a contrast.
