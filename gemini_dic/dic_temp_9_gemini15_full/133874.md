nongravity: /ˌnɒnˈɡrævɪti/ | adj. | 无重力的，失重的 |  Lacking gravity; weightless.  The term is often used in the context of space travel or hypothetical scenarios where the effects of gravity are negligible. | Example: The astronauts experienced nongravity conditions during their spacewalk.  宇航员在太空行走期间经历了失重状态。 | Near synonyms: weightless, gravity-free | Antonyms: gravitational, heavy |  词性:形容词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The experiment demonstrates nongravity. = 实验展示了失重现象。
This material simulates a nongravity environment. = 此材料模拟了无重力环境。


一般过去时:
The spacecraft entered a period of nongravity. = 宇宙飞船进入了一段失重时期。
The astronauts felt nongravity for the first time. = 宇航员第一次感受到了失重。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the effects of nongravity on the human body. = 科学家们已经研究了失重对人体的影響。
They have successfully created a nongravity environment in the lab. = 他们已成功地在实验室中创造了一个无重力环境。


过去完成时:
Before the launch, they had prepared for the nongravity conditions. = 发射前，他们已经为失重状态做好了准备。
The engineers had anticipated the challenges of nongravity during the design phase. = 工程师们在设计阶段就预料到了失重的挑战。


将来时:
The new spaceship will experience prolonged periods of nongravity. = 新宇宙飞船将经历长时间的失重状态。
Future space stations will need to effectively manage the effects of nongravity. = 未来的空间站需要有效地应对失重的影响。


虚拟语气:
If we could create perfect nongravity, many experiments would be easier. = 如果我们能创造完美的失重状态，许多实验就会更容易进行。
I wish I could experience true nongravity. = 我希望我能体验真正的失重。


被动语态:
Nongravity conditions are simulated for astronaut training. = 模拟失重环境用于宇航员训练。
The effects of nongravity are being studied extensively. = 失重的影响正被广泛研究。


疑问句:
Does this experiment demonstrate nongravity? = 这个实验是否展示了失重？
How long will they experience nongravity? = 他们将经历多长时间的失重？


否定句:
The conditions were not perfectly nongravity. = 条件并非完全失重。
The experiment did not fully simulate nongravity. = 该实验并未完全模拟失重。


PHRASE->
nongravity environment: 无重力环境
nongravity simulation: 失重模拟
nongravity training: 失重训练
effects of nongravity: 失重影响
