词源:  From Old French *discret, from Latin discretus, past participle of discernere "to separate, distinguish," from dis- "apart" + cernere "to separate, distinguish".  The sense development is from "separate, distinct" to "able to keep things separate (secrets, etc.)," hence "discreet."  The superlative "-est" signifies the highest degree.
