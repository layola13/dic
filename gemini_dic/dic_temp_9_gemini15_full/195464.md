词源:

The word "semiofficial" is a combination of the prefix "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partially") and the adjective "official."  The prefix "semi-" derives from Latin "semi-," which itself comes from the Proto-Indo-European root "*sem-" meaning "half," "partly," or "together."  "Official" derives from the Latin "officialis," meaning "belonging to an office" or "of or pertaining to an office."
