entomolin: /ˌɛntəˈmɒlɪn/ | n. |昆虫学，昆虫学原理|  A hypothetical term; there is no established word "entomolin" in standard English dictionaries.  It might be a neologism, a misspelling, or a term specific to a niche field.  If it's a neologism, it likely combines "entomo-" (relating to insects) with "-lin," a suffix sometimes used to denote a substance or principle. One could speculate that it might refer to a hypothetical insecticide, a principle of insect behavior, or a similar concept.  However, without further context, its meaning remains unclear and its usage is nonexistent.  |No example sentences possible due to lack of established meaning. | No synonyms or antonyms can be provided without a defined meaning. |n.
