词源:
The phrase "in the clouds" is a straightforward combination of the preposition "in," the definite article "the," and the plural noun "clouds."  Its figurative meaning developed from the literal meaning of being physically located within clouds. The metaphorical extension to describe someone as being absent-minded or daydreaming likely arose from the sense of detachment and unreality associated with clouds.  There's no single historical event or linguistic evolution to pinpoint; it's a natural metaphorical development based on common experience.
