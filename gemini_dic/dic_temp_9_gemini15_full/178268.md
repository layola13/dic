It often involves repeating a calculation or a series of calculations. |例句：The recomputations revealed a significant error in the initial data. 重新计算揭示了初始数据中的一个重大错误。
例句：After finding a bug in the code, the engineers performed several recomputations to verify the results. 在发现代码中的错误后，工程师进行了多次重新计算以验证结果。|近义词： recalculations, re-evaluations |反义词： initial calculations, first estimations |名词
