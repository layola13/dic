词源:
The word "microcomputer" is a compound word.  "Micro" comes from the Greek word "mikros," meaning "small," and "computer" comes from the verb "compute," meaning "to calculate."  Therefore, "microcomputer" literally means a small computer. The term emerged in the 1970s with the advent of smaller, cheaper, and more accessible computers than their mainframe predecessors.
