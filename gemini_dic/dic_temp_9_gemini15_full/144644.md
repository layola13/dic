词源:
The word "outworn" is a compound word formed from "out-" and "worn."  "Out-" is a prefix indicating excess or completion,  similar to "beyond" or "past." "Worn" is the past participle of the verb "to wear," meaning to become damaged or deteriorated through use or time.  Therefore, "outworn" literally means "worn out beyond use" or "worn out completely."
