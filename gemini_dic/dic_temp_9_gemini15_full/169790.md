词源:

From Middle French *prosaïque, from Late Latin prosaicus, from Latin prōsa “prose,” from prōsus, past participle of prōfārī “to speak forth,” from prō- “forth” + fārī “to speak.”  Ultimately related to the verb "fare" (to go, travel).  The original meaning referenced the straightforward, unadorned style of prose writing as opposed to the heightened language of poetry.


用法说明:


Prosaic is primarily used as an adjective to describe something lacking in poetic or imaginative qualities; something commonplace, dull, or unimaginative.  It can be applied to writing style, events, or even people.
