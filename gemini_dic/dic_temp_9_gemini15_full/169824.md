词源:

The word "prosecrecy" is a relatively modern coinage. It combines the prefix "pro-" (meaning "in favor of," "supporting," or "for") with the noun "secrecy."  Therefore, it literally means "in favor of secrecy" or "the act of supporting secrecy."  While not a word found in traditional dictionaries, its meaning is readily understandable based on its constituent parts.  It emphasizes the active and deliberate nature of maintaining secrecy, unlike the simple noun "secrecy" which is more descriptive.
