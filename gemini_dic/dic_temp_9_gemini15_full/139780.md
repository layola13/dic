octanes:/ˈɒkteɪnz/| n.|辛烷(类)|Octanes are a group of isomeric alkanes with the chemical formula C₈H₁₈.  They are important components of gasoline and other fuels.  Different octanes have different properties, affecting the fuel's performance and combustion characteristics.|例句：The octane rating of the gasoline is a measure of its resistance to knocking during combustion. 辛烷值是汽油在燃烧过程中抗爆震能力的衡量标准。|The octane number of this fuel is 95.  这种燃料的辛烷值是95。|近义词：hydrocarbons, alkanes|反义词：无

USAGE->
