nonionizing: /ˌnɒnˈaɪənaɪzɪŋ/ | adj. | 非电离的 |  Not having enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules.  This means it doesn't knock electrons off atoms, resulting in less potential for damage to living tissue compared to ionizing radiation. Examples include radio waves, microwaves, infrared light, visible light, and ultraviolet light (although high-energy UV can be ionizing). |  Example:  Nonionizing radiation, such as radio waves, is used in many common technologies.  非电离辐射，例如无线电波，被用于许多常见技术中。| 近义词：non-ionizing | 反义词：ionizing
