The word "pushminas" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a place name, a person's name, or a brand name not widely known.
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It could be a newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.
* **It's a word from another language:** If it's from another language, please specify the language so I can attempt a translation and explanation.


Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you'd like me to help.
