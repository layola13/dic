词源:
The word "ellipticalness" is derived from the adjective "elliptical," which in turn comes from the noun "ellipse."  "Ellipse" originates from the Greek word ἔλλειψις (élleipsis), meaning "omission," "defect," or "falling short."  The "-ness" suffix is added to create a noun indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, "ellipticalness" literally refers to the quality of being elliptical, encompassing both the geometric shape and the linguistic sense of omission or incompleteness.
