The word "lardry" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no standard pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a dialect word, or a proper noun.  To provide an analysis, I need more context where you encountered this word.  If you can provide the source, I can offer a more accurate interpretation.
