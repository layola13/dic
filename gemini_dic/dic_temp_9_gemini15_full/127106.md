词源:  The word "nationalization" derives from the word "nation" (from Latin *natio, meaning "birth," "race," or "people") and the suffix "-ization," indicating the process of making something national or belonging to a nation.  The process of creating something national is thus denoted by the suffix "-ization" added to the root "nation".
