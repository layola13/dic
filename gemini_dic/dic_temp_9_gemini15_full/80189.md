The word "goding" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage description cannot be provided.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?

2. **It's a neologism:**  It might be a newly coined word, slang, or a word specific to a particular community or field.  If this is the case, more context is needed to understand its meaning and usage.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name (person, place, or thing).


To help me provide the requested analysis, please provide more context, such as:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (e.g., a book, website, conversation)
* **What was the surrounding text or conversation?**  This will help determine the intended meaning.
* **What is the intended part of speech?** (noun, verb, adjective, etc.)

With more information, I can attempt to offer a more accurate analysis.
