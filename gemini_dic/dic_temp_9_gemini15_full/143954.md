outqueried: /ˌaʊtˈkwɪəri/ | v. | 超过；胜过（在询问或调查中） | To surpass or exceed in the process of questioning or inquiry.  This is not a standard dictionary word; it's a newly coined word formed by combining "out-" (meaning exceeding or surpassing) and "queried" (the past participle of "query"). Therefore, a direct translation and detailed grammatical analysis are not possible in the same way as with established words.  |  例句：His investigation outqueried the police's initial inquiries, revealing crucial new evidence.  他的调查超过了警方最初的询问，揭示了重要的新的证据。 | 近义词:  surpassed, exceeded, outstripped | 反义词:  undermined, surpassed (in a negative context) |
