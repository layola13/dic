词源：The word "displicence" is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the noun "licence" (meaning "freedom to act" or "permission").  The original meaning likely referred to a lack of freedom or permission, but it evolved to signify the displeasure resulting from something being done without permission or against one's wishes.  Over time, the connotation shifted to encompass general dislike or disapproval.
