词源:
The word "otolaryngology" is a compound word formed from Greek roots:

* **oto-**: from Greek *οὖς* (ous), meaning "ear"
* **laryngo-**: from Greek *λάρυγξ* (larynx), meaning "larynx" (voice box)
* **-logy**: from Greek *λογία* (logia), meaning "the study of"

Therefore, otolaryngology literally means "the study of the ear, larynx, and related structures."  The scope of the field has expanded to also include the nose and throat.
