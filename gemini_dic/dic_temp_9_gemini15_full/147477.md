词源:

The word "overoptimistic" is a combination of the prefix "over-", meaning "too much" or "excessively," and the adjective "optimistic."  "Optimistic" itself comes from the Latin word "optimus," meaning "best," via the French "optimiste."  Therefore, "overoptimistic" literally means "excessively believing in the best possible outcome."
