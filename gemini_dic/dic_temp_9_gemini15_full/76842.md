gang-bangs:/ˈɡæŋbæŋz/| n. |轮奸；多人性交|A gang bang is a sexual act involving multiple partners simultaneously. It typically refers to a situation where one person has sex with multiple partners at the same time.  The term is often associated with violence and non-consensual sex. |例句：The victim reported a gang bang involving several assailants. 受害者报告了一起涉及多名袭击者的轮奸案。

The term is highly offensive and should be used with extreme caution, if at all.  Its use often trivializes sexual assault and violence. |近义词：group sex (less offensive, but still implies multiple partners), multiple partner sex (more neutral)|反义词： N/A (there is no direct antonym, as the term describes a specific type of sexual act.)
