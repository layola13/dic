lantanuric:/ˌlæntəˈnʊrɪk/| adj.| 镧中毒的 | Relating to or caused by lanthanum poisoning.  Lanthanum is a rare earth element, and its toxicity is relatively low compared to some other heavy metals, but exposure to high levels can still cause adverse health effects.  The term "lantanuric" is less common and often found in specialized toxicological literature. |例句：While less common than other heavy metal poisonings, there are documented cases of lantanuric effects in occupational settings.  镧中毒虽然不像其他重金属中毒那么常见，但在职业环境中仍有文献记载的镧中毒病例。 |近义词：lanthanum-induced, lanthanum-related |反义词：None specifically, but terms describing the absence of lanthanum poisoning could be used, such as "lanthanum-free" or "healthy" in the relevant context.
