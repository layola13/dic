词源：

The word "eventually" comes from the Old French word "eventuel," which means "accidental, contingent."  It's derived from the Latin word "eventus," meaning "outcome, result, event."  The "-ally" suffix transforms the adjective "eventual" into an adverb, indicating "in the manner of" or "as a result of" the event.
