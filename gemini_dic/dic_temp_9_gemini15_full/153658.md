pentyl:/ˈpɛntɪl/| n. |戊基|A pentyl group is a five-carbon alkyl group with the formula −C₅H₁₁.  It's a branched or unbranched hydrocarbon chain attached to a larger molecule. There are eight isomers of pentyl, each differing in the arrangement of carbon atoms.  They are important components in many organic compounds. |Pentyl acetate is used as a solvent.  The pentyl group is found in many natural products and synthetic chemicals.|近义词：amyl (less precise)|反义词：None (it's a functional group, not something with a direct opposite)|名词
