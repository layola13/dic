近义词：unhelpful, unobliging, uncooperative, informal


反义词：officious, helpful, obliging, cooperative, formal


词源：The word derives from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and "officious," which itself comes from the Latin "officiosus," meaning "obliging," "serviceable," or "dutiful."  However, the modern sense of "officious" carries a negative connotation, implying excessive or unwanted helpfulness.  Therefore, "inofficious" reverses this negative connotation to mean a lack of such meddlesome helpfulness.
