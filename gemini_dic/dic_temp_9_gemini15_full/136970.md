词源:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not."
* **speculative**:  Derived from the Latin word "speculare," meaning "to look out, observe," and ultimately connected to "speculum," meaning "mirror."  It came to mean engaging in conjecture or guesswork.


用法说明:

The word "nonspeculative" is primarily used as an adjective to describe information, approaches, investments, or analyses that are grounded in facts and avoid conjecture.  It contrasts with "speculative," which implies a reliance on guesswork or prediction.
