词源:
The word "entoperipheral" is a relatively rare term, likely a combination of "ento-" (meaning "within" or "inner," though less common in this context) and "peripheral" (meaning "relating to the outer edge or boundary").  The "ento-" prefix is sometimes used in medical terminology to refer to something within a structure, though in this case, the overall meaning suggests a focus on the outward effects.  Therefore, the word's exact etymology requires further investigation within specialized medical literature.  The more common and accurate usage would be simply "peripheral".
