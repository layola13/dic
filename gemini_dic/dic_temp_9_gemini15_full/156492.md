The word "Picardo" does not appear in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a proper noun, possibly a surname or a place name, or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is not possible.  To provide the requested information, I need a correctly spelled and defined word.  If you could provide more context (sentence where you encountered the word, its origin, etc.), I can offer a more accurate analysis.
