pleomorphism:/ˌpliːoʊˈmɔːrfɪzəm/| n. |多形性，多态性 |The ability of an organism or species to exhibit different forms during its life cycle, or in different environmental conditions.  This is particularly relevant in microbiology, where it refers to the ability of bacteria to change shape or size in response to their environment. |Example: The pleomorphism of the bacteria made identification difficult.  多形细菌的形态变化使得鉴定变得困难。|近义词：polymorphism, variability|反义词：monomorphism


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Pleomorphism is a common phenomenon in some bacteria.  = 多形性在某些细菌中是一种常见现象。

过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the pleomorphism had been a mystery. = 在发现之前，多形性一直是个谜。
They had not anticipated the degree of pleomorphism exhibited by the organism. = 他们没有预料到该生物表现出的多形性程度。


将来时:
Further studies will investigate the causes of pleomorphism. = 后续研究将调查多形性的成因。
