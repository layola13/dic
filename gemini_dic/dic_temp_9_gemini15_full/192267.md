词源:
The word "screen" originates from Old French "escren," meaning "sieve" or "coarse cloth."  Its use evolved to describe a protective barrier, then a surface for projecting images.  The verb "screened" follows this semantic development, retaining the sense of separating, filtering, or protecting.
