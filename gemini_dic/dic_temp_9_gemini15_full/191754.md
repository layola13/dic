词源:
The word "scimitar" comes from the Middle French word *cimiterre*, which in turn is derived from the Arabic word *ṣāmyā*.  The Arabic word likely has roots in the Persian word *šamšīr* (شمشیر), meaning "sword."  Therefore, the word's journey reflects the historical spread of this type of sword through the Middle East and beyond.
