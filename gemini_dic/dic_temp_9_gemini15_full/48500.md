Etymology:

The word "deeprootedness" is a noun formed from the adjective "deeprooted," which itself combines "deep" (meaning "extending far down") and "rooted" (meaning "firmly established or ingrained").  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun indicating a state or quality.  The ultimate origin lies in the Old English words "dēop" (deep) and "rōt" (root).

Usage:

Deeprootedness refers to the state of being firmly established and difficult to change or remove. It implies a long-standing presence and strong foundation.  It is often used to describe beliefs, traditions, habits, or social structures.
