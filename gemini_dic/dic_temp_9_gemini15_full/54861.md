词源:

The word "displeasance" is derived from the Old French word *desplesance*, which itself comes from the prefix "des-" (meaning "away from" or "opposite of") and the word "plesance" (meaning "pleasure").  Therefore, "displeasance" literally means "the state of being without pleasure" or "the opposite of pleasure."  The evolution from Old French to Modern English involved relatively minor phonetic changes.
