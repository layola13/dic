词源:
The word "nudge" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "noggen," meaning "to push gently with the elbow."  "Noggen" likely originated from an Old Norse or Old English root, though the precise etymology is uncertain.  Over time, "noggen" evolved into "nudge," retaining its core meaning of a gentle push.
