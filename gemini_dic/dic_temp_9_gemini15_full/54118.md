词源:
The word "disenchained" is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away from" or "opposite of"), "en-" (a prefix indicating "to put into" or "to cause to be"), "chain" (a series of linked metal rings), and the suffix "-ed" (past participle).  Therefore, it literally means "removed from chains" or "freed from chains."  The "en-" prefix indicates the act of putting into a state of being chained, and the "dis-" prefix reverses this action.
