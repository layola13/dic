词源:
The word "pithiest" is the superlative form of the adjective "pithy," which itself derives from "pith."  "Pith" originally referred to the soft, spongy central part of a plant stem.  Figuratively, this came to mean the essential or most important part of something, leading to the sense of "concise" and "forceful" in the adjective "pithy."  The "-iest" suffix adds the superlative meaning, indicating the "most" pithy.
