exponentiations:/ˌɛkspəʊˌnɛnʃiˈeɪʃənz/ | n. | 指数运算，幂运算 | The process of raising a number to a power.  It involves multiplying a base number by itself a specified number of times.  For example, 2 to the power of 3 (written as 2³) is an exponentiation, resulting in 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. | The calculations involved complex exponentiations.  这些计算涉及复杂的指数运算。|  power calculations, involution |  logarithms | noun
