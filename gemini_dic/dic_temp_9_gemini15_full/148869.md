词源:

The word "overweening" comes from the Old English "oferwenan," which means "to surpass, to overcome."  The prefix "over-" indicates excess or surpassing a limit.  The element "-weening" is related to the verb "ween," meaning "to think," "to believe," or "to suppose."  Therefore, "overweening" originally meant "thinking too much of oneself," or having excessive self-belief.  Over time, the meaning evolved to emphasize the negative aspects of excessive pride and confidence.
