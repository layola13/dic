physicalism: /ˈfɪzɪkəlɪzəm/ | n. | 物理主义 |

英文解析:The philosophical view that everything, including mental states and consciousness, is ultimately physical or can be explained in terms of physical processes.  It denies the existence of non-physical substances or properties.  Different versions of physicalism exist, ranging from reductive physicalism (which claims mental states are reducible to physical states) to non-reductive physicalism (which allows for emergent properties that are not fully reducible).


例句:
