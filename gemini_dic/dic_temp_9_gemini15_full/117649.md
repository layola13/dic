megaweber:/ˈmɛɡəˌweɪbər/| n. |兆韦伯|A megaweber (MWb) is a unit of magnetic flux, equal to one million webers.  It's a large unit rarely used in practice, typically encountered in theoretical calculations or exceptionally high-flux scenarios. The weber (Wb) itself is the SI unit of magnetic flux.  The prefix "mega" indicates a million. |Example: The superconducting magnet generated a magnetic flux exceeding 10 MWb.  超导磁体产生的磁通量超过10兆韦伯。|近义词：million webers (less formal)|反义词：There's no direct antonym;  smaller units like weber, kiloweber could be considered as opposites in magnitude.|名词


USAGE->
This word is a unit of measurement and doesn't have typical verb conjugations like "hello".  Its usage is confined to expressing quantities of magnetic flux.

Example 1: The experiment measured a magnetic flux of 5 MWb.  实验测量了5兆韦伯的磁通量。

Example 2:  Calculations predicted a peak magnetic flux of 20 MWb. 计算预测峰值磁通量为20兆韦伯。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly involving "megaweber" due to its specialized scientific usage.  Phrases involving "weber" or "magnetic flux" would be more relevant.
