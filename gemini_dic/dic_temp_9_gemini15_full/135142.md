nonohmic:/nɒnˈoʊmɪk/ | adj. | 非欧姆的 | Not exhibiting Ohm's law; having a resistance that varies with the current or voltage.  A nonohmic device doesn't follow the linear relationship between voltage and current described by Ohm's law (V=IR).  | Example: A diode is a nonohmic device because its resistance depends on the direction of the current. 一个二极管是非欧姆器件，因为它的电阻取决于电流的方向。 |近义词： nonlinear (in relation to current and voltage)| 反义词：ohmic |  词性：形容词
