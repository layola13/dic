proteases:/ˈproʊtiˌeɪziz/ | n. | 蛋白酶 | Enzymes that break down proteins into smaller polypeptide chains or amino acids.  They play a crucial role in various biological processes, including digestion, blood clotting, and immune response. | Example:  The pancreas produces proteases that aid in the digestion of proteins.  胰腺产生有助于蛋白质消化的蛋白酶。 |近义词: proteinases, peptidases | 反义词:  (没有直接的反义词，可以考虑protein synthesis 合成蛋白质) | 名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Proteases break down proteins. = 蛋白酶分解蛋白质。
The body produces many different types of proteases. = 人体产生许多不同类型的蛋白酶。


一般过去时:
Researchers identified a new protease. = 研究人员发现了一种新的蛋白酶。
The experiment tested the activity of several proteases. = 实验测试了几种蛋白酶的活性。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered many proteases. = 科学家们已经发现了许多蛋白酶。
We have used proteases in this experiment. = 我们在这个实验中使用了蛋白酶。


过去完成时:
The cells had already released their proteases. = 细胞已经释放了它们的蛋白酶。
The reaction had completed before the protease was added. = 在添加蛋白酶之前，反应已经完成了。


将来时:
We will use proteases in our next experiment. = 我们将在下一次实验中使用蛋白酶。
They will analyze the proteases found in the sample. = 他们将分析样本中发现的蛋白酶。


虚拟语气:
If we had more proteases, the experiment would be more successful. = 如果我们有更多蛋白酶，实验将会更成功。
It is important that the proteases remain active. = 蛋白酶保持活性很重要。


被动语态:
Proteases are used in many industrial processes. = 蛋白酶被用于许多工业过程。
The proteins were broken down by proteases. = 蛋白质被蛋白酶分解。


疑问句:
What types of proteases are involved in this process? = 这个过程中涉及哪些类型的蛋白酶？
Are these proteases effective at low temperatures? = 这些蛋白酶在低温下有效吗？


否定句:
The sample did not contain any proteases. = 样本中不含任何蛋白酶。
These proteases do not function at high temperatures. = 这些蛋白酶在高温下不起作用。



PHRASE->
protease inhibitors: 蛋白酶抑制剂
serine proteases: 丝氨酸蛋白酶
aspartic proteases: 天冬氨酸蛋白酶
metalloproteases: 金属蛋白酶
cysteine proteases: 半胱氨酸蛋白酶


词源:
The word "protease" is derived from "protein" and the suffix "-ase," which is used to denote enzymes.  The suffix "-ase" indicates that the word refers to an enzyme.  Therefore, protease literally means "protein-cutting enzyme".
