词源:
The term "high-explosive" is a compound word.  "High" refers to the explosive's power relative to low explosives (like gunpowder). "Explosive" derives from the verb "explode," ultimately from the Latin "explodere," meaning "to drive out," "to clap out," or "to detonate."  The development of high explosives as a distinct category is relatively recent, tied to advances in chemistry in the 19th and 20th centuries.
