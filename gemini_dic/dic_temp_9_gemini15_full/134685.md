Word Origin:  The word is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "marriageable" (meaning suitable for marriage).  "Marriageable" itself derives from "marriage" + "-able" (suffix indicating capability or suitability).  The root "marriage" traces back to Old French "mariage" and ultimately to Latin "maritare" (to marry).
