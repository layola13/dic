The word "hotaka" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a proper noun, possibly a Japanese word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and standard grammatical usage examples are impossible without more context.  To provide a response in the requested format would be inaccurate and misleading.

To help, please provide more context about where you encountered this word.  Knowing the source will enable a more accurate analysis and response. For example, is it:

* A place name? (e.g., a mountain, a town)
* A person's name?
* A word from a specific dialect or language?
* Part of a technical term?

With more information, I can attempt to provide a more complete and accurate response.
