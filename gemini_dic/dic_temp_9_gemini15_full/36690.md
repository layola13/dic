collimation:/ˌkɒlɪˈmeɪʃən/ | n. |准直；校准；对准 | The act of adjusting a device to ensure that its components are aligned correctly, typically to produce a parallel beam of light or other radiation.  This is crucial in optical instruments like telescopes and lasers to achieve sharp focus and accurate measurements. | Example:  Precise collimation of the telescope's mirrors is essential for optimal astronomical observation.  = 望远镜镜片的精确准直对于最佳天文观测至关重要。


The collimation of the laser beam was checked before the experiment. = 实验前检查了激光束的准直。|近义词：alignment, adjustment |反义词：misalignment


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The technician collimates the optical system regularly. = 技术员定期对光学系统进行准直。
Precise collimation ensures accurate measurements. = 精确的准直确保精确的测量。


一般过去时:
