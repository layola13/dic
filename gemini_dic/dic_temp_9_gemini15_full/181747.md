词源:
The word "relier" ultimately derives from the Old French word "relier," meaning "to bind together," "to link," or "to connect." This in turn comes from the Latin word "religare," which has the same basic meaning.  The prefix "re-" indicates repetition or intensification, while the root "-ligare" is related to the word "ligament," highlighting the sense of binding or connection.
