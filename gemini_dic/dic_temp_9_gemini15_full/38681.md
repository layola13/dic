condensability: /ˌkɒndensəˈbɪləti/ /ˌkɑːndɛnsəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可凝结性，可冷凝性 | The ability of a substance to condense from a gaseous to a liquid or solid state.  This property is often influenced by temperature and pressure.  | Example: The condensability of water vapor is crucial for cloud formation. 水蒸气的可凝结性对于云的形成至关重要。 | 近义词：condensability | 反义词：non-condensability
