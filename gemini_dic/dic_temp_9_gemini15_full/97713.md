USAGE->

This word is a relatively rare and complex noun formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" (implying multiple instances) to the already uncommon adjective "inimitable." As such, a detailed grammatical analysis across various tenses is not practically applicable.  The word itself functions primarily in the singular or plural present tense.

Example Sentences:

Present Tense (Singular): The inimitableness of his talent was evident. 他才能的无与伦比是显而易见的。

Present Tense (Plural): The inimitablenesses of the two paintings were strikingly different.  这两幅画的无与伦比之处截然不同。


PHRASE->

Because "inimitablenesses" is not a commonly used word, there are no common phrases associated with it.  The word's usage would typically stand alone as a descriptive noun.
