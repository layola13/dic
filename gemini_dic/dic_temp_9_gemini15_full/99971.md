/ˌɪntərˈɒsɪleɪtɪd/ | v. |相互振荡，交替振荡 | To oscillate or vibrate alternately or reciprocally.  It implies a back-and-forth movement or fluctuation between two or more states or conditions. | The two pendulums interoscillated, their movements subtly influencing each other.  两个钟摆相互振荡，它们的运动微妙地相互影响。|  vibrate, fluctuate, alternate |  static, still


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The two systems interoscillate constantly. = 这两个系统不断地相互振荡。
The pendulums interoscillate rhythmically. = 钟摆有节奏地相互振荡。


一般过去时:
The signals interoscillated during the experiment. = 实验过程中信号相互振荡。
The two circuits interoscillated briefly before stabilizing. = 两个电路在稳定之前短暂地相互振荡。


现在完成时:
The particles have interoscillated for several seconds. = 这些粒子已经相互振荡了几秒钟。
The components have interoscillated since the power was turned on. = 自从电源开启以来，这些组件就一直在相互振荡。


过去完成时:
The waves had interoscillated before the collision occurred. = 在碰撞发生之前，波浪已经相互振荡了。
The molecules had interoscillated for a significant period. = 分子已经相互振荡了一段时间。


将来时:
The lasers will interoscillate at a specific frequency. = 激光将在特定频率下相互振荡。
The circuits will interoscillate until the power is cut. = 电路将在电源切断之前相互振荡。


虚拟语气:
If the conditions were right, the oscillators would interoscillate. = 如果条件合适，振荡器就会相互振荡。
I wish the components would interoscillate more consistently. = 我希望这些组件能够更稳定地相互振荡。


被动语态:
The data showed that the signals were interoscillated. = 数据显示信号是相互振荡的。
It was observed that the particles were interoscillated. = 人们观察到粒子在相互振荡。


疑问句:
Do the two systems interoscillate? = 这两个系统是否相互振荡？
Are the waves interoscillating? = 波浪是否正在相互振荡？


否定句:
The systems did not interoscillate as expected. = 系统没有按照预期相互振荡。
The two pendulums did not interoscillate smoothly. = 两个钟摆没有平稳地相互振荡。


PHRASE->

There are no common phrases specifically using "interoscillated" as it's a relatively uncommon and technical term.  Phrases would need to be constructed around the concept of oscillation.  For example:

* **mutual oscillation:** 相互振荡
* **coupled oscillation:** 耦合振荡
* **resonant oscillation:** 共振振荡
* **damped oscillation:** 阻尼振荡
* **harmonic oscillation:** 简谐振荡
