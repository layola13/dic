词源：The word is a compound of "epoch" and "making."  "Epoch" comes from the French word "époque," ultimately derived from the Greek word "ἐποχή" (epokhe), meaning "a stopping, pause, or cessation." In its modern usage, it refers to a period of time marked by notable events or particular characteristics. "Making" refers to the process of creating or producing something.  Therefore, "epoch-making" describes something that creates a new epoch or era.
