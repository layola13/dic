词源:

The word "periscopically" is derived from "periscope" + "-ically".

"Periscope" itself comes from the Greek words:

* **peri- (περι-)**:  around, about
* **skopein (σκοπεῖν)**: to look, to see


Thus, "periscope" literally means "to look around," reflecting its function of allowing observation from a concealed position.  The suffix "-ically" transforms the noun into an adverb, indicating a manner or style.
