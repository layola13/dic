semi-ring:/ˈsemiːrɪŋ/| n.|半环|A semi-ring is a set with two binary operations, usually denoted as addition (+) and multiplication (⋅), satisfying certain axioms.  These axioms are a subset of those required for a ring, hence the name "semi-ring".  Specifically, a semi-ring is an algebraic structure that lacks the requirement of additive inverses.  This means that for every element, there isn't necessarily an element that, when added, results in a zero element.|Example: The set of non-negative real numbers with standard addition and multiplication forms a semi-ring.|近义词:  (partially related) ring, field|反义词: N/A


USAGE->
N/A  (Semi-ring is a mathematical concept, not used in typical grammatical structures like the example word "what")


PHRASE->
N/A (Semi-ring doesn't have common phrases associated with it in the same way as common words)
