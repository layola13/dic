The word "rileys" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely:

1. **A misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of other words, such as "relies," "riley's" (possessive of a proper noun), or a less common word.  More context is needed to determine the intended word.

2. **A proper noun:** It might be a surname or a place name.

3. **Slang or dialect:** It could be a slang term or a word used within a specific dialect or community.


Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested in the format because the word "rileys" lacks a standard dictionary definition.  To get a proper analysis, please provide the sentence or context in which you encountered this word.
