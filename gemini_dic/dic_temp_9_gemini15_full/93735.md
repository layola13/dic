近义词：irrelevant, unimportant, inconsequential, immaterial |反义词：important, relevant, essential, material


词源：The word "immaterial" comes from the Old French "imateriel," a combination of the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and "materiel" (meaning "material").  "Materiel" itself originates from the Latin "materia," meaning "matter" or "substance." Thus, the word's etymology directly reflects its meaning of "not of matter" or "unimportant."


用法说明:

1. **Unimportant or irrelevant:** This is the most common usage.  It describes something that has little or no bearing on a situation or decision.

例句：The cost is immaterial; I want to get this project finished. 成本无关紧要；我想完成这个项目。

例句：Whether he likes it or not is immaterial to me. 他是否喜欢与我无关。

2. **Non-physical or spiritual:** This usage refers to something that is not made of physical matter; it exists only as a concept or idea.

例句：Many believe in immaterial souls that live on after death. 许多人相信灵魂不死。

例句：The artist focused on creating an immaterial atmosphere of peace in his paintings.  这位艺术家专注于在他的绘画中创造一种非物质的和平氛围。


注意：在一些法律语境中，“immaterial”可能表示证据与案件无关，即使证据本身是真实存在的物质。  这与非物质的含义略有不同，应根据上下文理解。
