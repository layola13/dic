词源:

The word "infinitesimality" is derived from the word "infinitesimal," which itself comes from the Latin prefix "in-" (not) + "finitus" (bounded, limited) + "-imal" (denoting a suffix of quality or state).  The "ity" suffix makes it a noun, signifying the state or quality of being infinitesimal.  Therefore, it literally means "the state of being not bounded or limited in smallness," indicating an extremely small quantity.
