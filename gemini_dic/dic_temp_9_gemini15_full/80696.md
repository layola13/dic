gorgonia:/ɡɔːrˈɡoʊniə/| n.|戈尔戈尼亚珊瑚，柳珊瑚|A gorgonian is a type of coral belonging to the order Gorgonacea.  They are characterized by their branching, often tree-like or fan-like structure, and are typically found in shallow to deep waters.  They are colonial organisms, meaning they are composed of many individual polyps living together.  Many gorgonians have a hard, horny skeleton made of gorgonin, a type of protein. |Example: The divers marveled at the vibrant colors of the gorgonians swaying gently in the ocean current.  潜水员们惊叹于在洋流中轻轻摇曳的戈尔戈尼亚珊瑚的鲜艳色彩。  The research team studied the growth rate of the gorgonian colonies to understand their response to climate change. 研究小组研究了戈尔戈尼亚珊瑚群落的生长速度，以了解它们对气候变化的反应。|近义词：sea fan, sea whip|反义词：N/A
