词源:
The exact etymology of "loopie" is uncertain.  It's likely a slang term that emerged in the 20th century.  The connection might be to the idea of being "looped" or "out of it," suggesting a state of being slightly unhinged or disoriented, similar to being dizzy or confused.  The -ie suffix adds a diminutive or playful quality, softening the potentially negative connotation of "looped."  There is no direct historical link to a known root word.
