neuronavigation:/ˌnjʊroʊˌnævɪˈɡeɪʃən/| n. |神经导航|The use of computer-aided technology to guide surgical instruments or other medical devices during neurosurgical procedures.  It integrates anatomical images (like MRI or CT scans) with real-time tracking of instruments to enhance precision and safety. |Example: Neuronavigation allows surgeons to precisely target brain tumors while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. 神经导航技术允许外科医生精确地靶向脑肿瘤，同时最大限度地减少对周围健康组织的损伤。|近义词：image-guided surgery, computer-assisted surgery |反义词：blind surgery (lack of image guidance)|名词
