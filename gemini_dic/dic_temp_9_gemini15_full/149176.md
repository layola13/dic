oxybenzoic: /ˌɒksiˈbɛnzoʊɪk/ | adj. | 羟基苯甲酸的；邻羟基苯甲酸的 | Oxybenzoic refers to a class of organic compounds that are derivatives of benzoic acid, containing a hydroxyl group (-OH) attached to the benzene ring.  They are used in various applications, most notably as UV filters in sunscreens.  The specific position of the hydroxyl group on the benzene ring determines the isomer (ortho, meta, or para). | Example:  Oxybenzoic acid, specifically the para-hydroxybenzoic acid isomer, is a common ingredient in many sunscreens.  羟基苯甲酸，特别是对羟基苯甲酸异构体，是许多防晒霜中的常见成分。| 近义词:hydroxybenzoic (less specific)| 反义词:  None directly; the opposite would involve the absence of a hydroxyl group. | adj.


USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective describing a chemical compound, not a verb or noun that would demonstrate tense or voice changes in the way the example word "what" does. Therefore,  standard tense and voice conjugations are not applicable.  Instead, here are examples showing its usage:


Example sentences demonstrating the usage of "oxybenzoic" as an adjective:

1.  The sunscreen contained an oxybenzoic acid derivative.  该防晒霜含有羟基苯甲酸衍生物。

2.  Researchers are studying the efficacy of various oxybenzoic compounds in UV protection. 研究人员正在研究各种羟基苯甲酸化合物在紫外线防护方面的功效。


PHRASE->

Because "oxybenzoic" is primarily used as an adjective describing a chemical compound, it doesn't form common phrases in the same way as words like "what." Instead,  it is often used in conjunction with other terms to describe specific compounds or their properties.  Examples:


1. oxybenzoic acid: 羟基苯甲酸
2.  para-oxybenzoic acid: 对羟基苯甲酸
3.  meta-oxybenzoic acid: 间羟基苯甲酸
4.  ortho-oxybenzoic acid: 邻羟基苯甲酸
5.  oxybenzoic ester: 羟基苯甲酸酯


词源:

The word "oxybenzoic" is a combination of:

* **oxy-**:  From Greek *oxys* (ὀξύς), meaning "sharp," "acid," or "pointed," referring to the acidic nature of the hydroxyl group.

* **benz-**: From "benzene," referring to the benzene ring structure in the compound.

* **-oic**: A suffix used in organic chemistry to indicate a carboxylic acid group (-COOH).

Therefore, "oxybenzoic" literally means "containing oxygen and related to benzoic acid."
