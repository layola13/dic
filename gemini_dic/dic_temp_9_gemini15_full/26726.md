Etymology:
The word "cadger" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "caggere,"  meaning "to hawk,"  "to barter," or "to cheat."  This likely evolved from an earlier word related to  "cagey," suggesting cunning or slyness. The modern meaning, focused on obtaining things without paying, developed over time. The "-er" suffix denotes an agent or doer of the action.
