re-sampled:/ˌriːˈsæmpld/| v. |重新采样|To resample is to take a sample of data and create a new sample from it.  This often involves changing the number of data points, the sampling rate, or the distribution of the data.  Resampling techniques are frequently used in signal processing, image processing, and statistical analysis to improve data quality, reduce noise, or create more representative samples. |例句：The audio engineer re-sampled the recording to improve its quality. 音频工程师重新采样了录音以提高其质量。

The researchers re-sampled the data to ensure a more representative sample size. 研究人员重新采样数据以确保更具代表性的样本量。|近义词：resample, re-process, regenerate|反义词：None (the antonym would depend on the context; e.g., the opposite of *improving* data quality would be *degrading* data quality).|动词|
