interdifferentiating: /ˌɪntərˌdɪfərənˈʃieɪtɪŋ/ | v. |相互区分；相互区别 |  The process of distinguishing between or among different things, particularly in a context where those things are interacting or interconnected.  This word is less common and often used in specialized fields like biology or developmental studies, where it describes the process of cells or structures becoming different from one another. |例句：The researchers observed the interdifferentiating cells in the developing embryo.  研究人员观察了发育中的胚胎中相互分化的细胞。

The neural progenitor cells were interdifferentiating, leading to the formation of diverse neuronal subtypes. 神经祖细胞正在相互分化，导致形成多种神经元亚型。


近义词：differentiating, distinguishing, diversifying | 反义词：homogenizing, unifying

PHRASE->

由于该词较为专业，常见词组较少，以下提供一些可能的搭配，需根据上下文理解：

pattern of interdifferentiation  相互分化的模式
stages of interdifferentiation  相互分化的阶段
mechanism of interdifferentiation 相互分化的机制
regulation of interdifferentiation 相互分化的调控
study of interdifferentiation 相互分化的研究


词源:

The word "interdifferentiating" is formed by combining the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among"), the verb "differentiate" (meaning "to distinguish"), and the "-ing" suffix (indicating a present participle).  Therefore, it literally means "distinguishing between or among each other."
