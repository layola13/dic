词源:
The word "forearmed" comes from the Old English "fore-" (meaning "before" or "in front of") and "earmed" (past participle of "earm," meaning "arm" or "equip").  The original meaning therefore related to being equipped beforehand.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the broader sense of being prepared for something, often something negative or challenging.
