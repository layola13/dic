The word "confinednesses" is a relatively rare word, formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to the adjective "confined".  This suffix transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being confined.  It emphasizes the plural aspect of multiple limitations or restrictions.  The word doesn't have a direct etymological root beyond its composition from "confined."  The root of "confined" lies in the Old French word "confine," meaning "boundary" or "limit," ultimately deriving from the Latin "confīnēs" (plural of "confīnis"), meaning "boundary," "border," or "neighboring region."
