词源:
The word "caterpillar" comes from the Middle English "cattepillar," which is a combination of "catte" (cat) and "pillar" (pillar). The origin of this unusual combination is uncertain, but it may have referred to its appearance – perhaps resembling a cat walking along a pillar, or perhaps reflecting a medieval belief that caterpillars were some kind of destructive pest that "pillared" or ravaged crops.  The earlier forms suggest a connection to the Old French "chatepelose," which literally means "hairy cat."
