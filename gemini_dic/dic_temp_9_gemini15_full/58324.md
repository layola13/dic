词源:
The adverb "dryly" is derived from the adjective "dry," which ultimately originates from the Old English word "drȳge," meaning "dry."  The "-ly" suffix is a common adverbial suffix in English, indicating manner.  The evolution of the word's meaning from simply "in a dry manner" to include the connotations of humorlessness and emotional detachment is a semantic shift reflecting its usage in contexts of understated wit or sarcasm.
