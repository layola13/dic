monesin: /ˈmoʊnɪsɪn/ | n. |莫能菌素| A polyether ionophore antibiotic produced by *Streptomyces cinnamonensis*.  It acts as an ionophore, transporting ions across cell membranes, which disrupts cellular function, particularly in the mitochondria.  This disruption is toxic to many organisms, making it useful as a coccidiostat in animal feed and a potential treatment for various diseases. However, its toxicity also limits its use. |Example: Monesin is commonly used as a coccidiostat in poultry feed to prevent coccidiosis. 莫能菌素常用作家禽饲料中的球虫抑制剂以预防球虫病。|近义词:salinomycin, lasalocid|反义词: N/A |名词
