concernedness's:/kənˈsɜːrndnəsɪz/ | n. | 担忧的；关切的；焦虑的 | The possessive form of "concernedness," indicating possession or belonging to something related to worry, care, or anxiety.  It represents the state or quality of being concerned.  It is rarely used in modern English and often considered grammatically awkward.  A more natural way to express the meaning would be to use "concerns" or a possessive pronoun with "concern."| Example:The project's concernedness's were addressed in the meeting. (Awkward; better: The project's concerns were addressed in the meeting. / Its concerns were addressed...) |近义词: anxieties, worries, cares |反义词: indifference, unconcern, apathy |名词
