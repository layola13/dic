词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "conversancy," which derives from "conversant," meaning "familiar" or "well-acquainted."  "Conversant" itself comes from the Middle English word "conversaunt," ultimately tracing back to the Old French "conversant" and the Latin "conversari," meaning "to converse" or "to live together."
