词源：

The word "establishable" is derived from the verb "establish," which comes from the Old French word "establir," meaning "to establish, settle, found."  This, in turn, has roots in the Latin word "stabilis," meaning "firm, stable."  The suffix "-able" is added to create the adjective form, indicating capability or possibility.
