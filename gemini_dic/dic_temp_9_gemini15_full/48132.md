decohered:/ˌdiːkəˈhɪərd/| v. |退相干的；失去相干性的 | To lose coherence; to become incoherent.  This term is primarily used in physics, particularly in quantum mechanics, to describe the loss of quantum coherence.  It refers to the process where a quantum system loses its quantum properties and behaves classically. | 例句：The superposition of states decohered rapidly due to environmental interaction.  由于环境相互作用，态的叠加迅速退相干。

The qubit decohered before we could perform the measurement. 量子比特在我们可以进行测量之前就退相干了。 | 近义词：disintegrated, unraveled, disrupted | 反义词：cohered, maintained coherence | 动词
