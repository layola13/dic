词源:

The word "hypersuspiciousness" is a combination of:

* **hyper-**:  A prefix meaning "excessive," "above," or "beyond."  Derived from Greek ὑπέρ (hupér).
* **suspicious**:  Adjective meaning inclined to believe that someone is guilty of wrongdoing. Derived from Middle English *suspicios*, from Old French *suspicios*, from Latin *suspiciosus*, from *suspicari* "to suspect."
* **-ness**: A suffix forming nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.  Derived from Old English *-nes.


Therefore, hypersuspiciousness literally means "the state or condition of being excessively suspicious."
