词源:  The word "demonstrator" comes from the verb "demonstrate," which itself comes from the Late Latin word *demonstrare*, meaning "to point out," "to show," or "to prove."  The prefix "de-" means "away" or "from," and "-monstrare" is related to the Latin word "monstrare," meaning "to show." Thus, the original meaning points to the act of clearly showing or proving something.  The modern usage extends this to those who publicly show their views through protest or demonstration.
