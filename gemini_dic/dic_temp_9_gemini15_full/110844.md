词源:

The word "linter" has two related etymologies, both referring to the removal of small particles:

1.  **In the context of software:**  It's a metaphorical extension of the meaning of "lint," referring to small bits of fluff or debris.  A code linter removes "fluff" or questionable code elements.

2.  **In the context of textiles:** The original meaning refers to a machine that removes lint from cloth.  This is the older and more literal meaning.  The software application's name is a direct metaphorical borrowing from this original meaning.
