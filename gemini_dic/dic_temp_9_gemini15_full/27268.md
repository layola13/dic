calquing:/ˈkælkɪŋ/| n. |仿译，照字翻译|The process of translating words or phrases from one language to another by directly borrowing and adapting their literal meaning, rather than conveying the underlying meaning or cultural context.  This often results in awkward or unnatural-sounding translations.|Example:  The German word "Schadenfreude" has been calqued into English as "schadenfreude," rather than being translated with a more natural equivalent like "malicious joy."|近义词：loan translation, literal translation|反义词：free translation, idiomatic translation
