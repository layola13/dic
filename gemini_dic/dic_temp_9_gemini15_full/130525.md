/ˌnɒnæˈkriːʃənz/ | n. | 非增生，未增生物质 | Nonaccretions refer to materials or substances that have not been added to or accumulated in a particular system or structure.  This term is often used in geology, astronomy, and other scientific fields to describe things that haven't become part of a growing mass or entity. For example, in geology, nonaccretions could be materials that were present but didn't become incorporated into a forming rock. | The study focused on the nonaccretions within the sedimentary layer, indicating periods of erosion rather than deposition.  = 这项研究的重点是沉积层中的非增生物质，表明存在侵蚀期而非沉积期。


The lack of nonaccretions in the sample suggests continuous growth. = 样本中缺乏非增生物质表明持续增长。| 近义词: non-additions, unaccumulated materials | 反义词: accretions, additions, accumulations | 名词
