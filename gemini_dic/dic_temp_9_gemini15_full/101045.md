词源:
The word "inveigle" comes from the Old French word "engigler," meaning "to entangle," "to ensnare," or "to deceive."  This in turn has roots in the Latin word "in-" (in, into) and "viculare" (to bind).  The meaning evolved over time from a more literal sense of entanglement to the figurative sense of persuading someone subtly or deceptively.
