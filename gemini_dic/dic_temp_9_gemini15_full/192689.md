scypha:/ˈsɪfə/| n. |杯状海绵；水螅体|A scypha is a type of small, vase-shaped, solitary hydrozoan polyp, commonly known as a goblet or cup sponge. They are sessile (non-motile) animals found in shallow marine waters.  Scypha are characterized by their simple body structure, with a single opening (the osculum) at the top for water intake and waste expulsion. They are filter feeders, trapping food particles from the water column.|Example: The researchers observed the feeding behavior of the scypha in the laboratory.|近义词:hydrozoan, polyp|反义词:None.
