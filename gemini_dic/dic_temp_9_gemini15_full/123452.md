monoptote:/ˈmɒnəpəʊt/| n. |单格词|A word that has only one case form.  This typically applies to nouns, pronouns, or adjectives that lack inflectional changes to indicate grammatical function (such as nominative, genitive, dative, accusative).  Many monosyllabic words in modern English are effectively monoptotes, as they lack the declensional variations found in classical languages like Latin or Greek.  |Example: The word "sheep" in Modern English functions as both the singular and plural form, lacking distinct case markings.  Another example is the pronoun "it", which remains unchanged regardless of its grammatical role in a sentence.|近义词：invariable word, indeclinable word|反义词：polytote
