dodecahedrons:/ˌdoʊˌdekəˈhiːdrənz/ | n. | 十二面体复数 |  A dodecahedron is a three-dimensional solid with twelve faces.  Dodecahedrons can be regular (all faces are identical regular pentagons) or irregular (faces are different shapes or sizes). | Example:  The crystal formed a complex dodecahedron shape.  这个晶体形成了一个复杂的十二面体形状。  The mathematician explored the properties of various dodecahedrons.这位数学家探索了各种十二面体的特性。| 近义词: polyhedron (多面体) | 反义词: N/A | 名词
