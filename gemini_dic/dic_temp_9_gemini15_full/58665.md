词源:
The name Dumfries is of Old English origin.  It's a compound of "Dum" (meaning "dark," "black," or "deep") and "frith" (meaning "peaceful place," "forest," or "river"). Therefore, it likely referred to a dark or deep forest or a peaceful place by a dark river.  The precise etymology is debated, but the combination of these Old English elements is widely accepted.
