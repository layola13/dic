词源:

The verb "conform" ultimately derives from the Latin prefix "con-" (meaning "together" or "with") and the verb "formare" (meaning "to form" or "to shape").  Thus, the original sense implied shaping something to fit together with something else, or to bring something into a specific shape.  The meaning has evolved to encompass the act of bringing oneself or something into agreement or compliance with a standard or rule.
