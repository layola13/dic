phototonus:/ˌfoʊtoʊˈtoʊnəs/| n. |光致张力，光紧张度|The term "phototonus" refers to the sustained muscle contraction caused by light exposure.  It's a relatively less common term, primarily used in specialized fields like ophthalmology and physiology. The effect is believed to be mediated through the pupillary light reflex and other photoreceptor-related pathways.  Further research is needed to fully elucidate the mechanisms involved.|Example: Studies on the phototonus of the iris muscle have revealed complexities in its response to various light intensities.|近义词: light-induced muscle tension, photosensitivity (in a relevant context)|反义词:  photorelaxation (a hypothetical opposite effect)


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun, and therefore doesn't have verb conjugations.  The usages would revolve around describing the phenomenon of phototonus in different contexts.


PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases directly involving "phototonus" due to its specialized nature.  Phrases would be built around it describing research or observations.  For example:


"Studies on the effect of blue light on iris phototonus..."
"Measuring phototonus in patients with photophobia..."
"The role of phototonus in pupillary regulation..."
"Changes in phototonus following retinal damage..."
"Analysis of phototonus response across different wavelengths..."
