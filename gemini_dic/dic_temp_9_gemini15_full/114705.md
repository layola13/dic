malleability: /ˌmælɪəˈbɪləti/ | n. |延展性；可塑性；易受影响 | The capacity of a substance to be hammered or pressed permanently out of shape without breaking or cracking.  It refers to the ability of a material to be deformed under compressive stress;  it also implies a degree of pliability or susceptibility to influence. |

例句：

The malleability of gold allows it to be easily shaped into jewelry.  黄金的延展性使其易于制成首饰。

The clay's malleability made it ideal for sculpting.  粘土的可塑性使其成为雕塑的理想材料。


近义词：ductility, flexibility, plasticity, moldability

反义词：brittleness, rigidity, inflexibility


词源:

From Middle French *malleabilité, from Latin *malleābilis ("capable of being hammered"), from malleus ("hammer").  The word ultimately derives from the Latin word "malleus," meaning "hammer," reflecting the historical method of shaping metals.
