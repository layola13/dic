由于“japingly”并非一个标准英语词汇，其词源难以追溯。它很可能是一个非正式的、口语化的词，由“japing”（嬉戏；开玩笑，现已过时）加上“-ly”后缀构成。  "Japing" itself may have roots in older forms of English related to playful or foolish behavior, but a definitive etymological trace is difficult to establish due to its informal and infrequent use.  The word carries a potentially offensive connotation due to its resemblance to a derogatory slur against Japanese people, therefore its usage should be avoided.
