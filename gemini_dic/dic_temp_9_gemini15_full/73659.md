forgeability: /fɔːrdʒəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可锻性，可锻造性 | The ability of a material to be shaped or worked by hammering, pressing, or rolling.  This property is crucial in metalworking, allowing for the creation of various shapes and forms.  The forgeability of a metal depends on factors such as its temperature, composition, and microstructure. | Example:  The high forgeability of aluminum makes it ideal for creating complex shapes in aircraft components.  铝的高可锻性使其成为制造飞机部件复杂形状的理想材料。 | 近义词: malleability, workability | 反义词: brittleness, infusibility
