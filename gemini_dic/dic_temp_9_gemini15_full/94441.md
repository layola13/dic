词源:

The adverb "imploringly" is derived from the verb "implore," which ultimately traces back to Old French *implorer and Latin *implorare.  The Latin verb is formed from *in- (meaning "in" or "into") and *plorare ("to weep, wail, cry out"). Thus, the original meaning involves crying out or weeping in a plea.  The "-ingly" suffix transforms the verb into an adverb, indicating the manner in which an action is performed.
