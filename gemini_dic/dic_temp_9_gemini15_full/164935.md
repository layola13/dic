pregratified: /ˌpriːˈɡrædəfaɪd/ | adj. | 事先满足的，预先满足的 |  This word is not a standard English word and is not found in major dictionaries.  It seems to be a neologism (newly coined word) formed by combining "pre-" (before) and "gratified" (satisfied). The intended meaning is likely something that has been satisfied or fulfilled before it was expected or needed. However, due to its non-standard nature,  there is no established usage, synonyms, or antonyms.  There are no reliable examples of its use in literature or common speech.


例句： (Since the word is not standard, examples are hypothetical illustrating the intended meaning)

Hypothetical Example 2:  The pregratified need for security made him complacent and less ambitious. = 事先满足的安全需求使他变得自满，缺乏雄心。
