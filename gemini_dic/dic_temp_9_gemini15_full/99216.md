This word is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) formed by combining "inter-" (between, among) and "cohesions" (the act of sticking together).  Therefore, a full etymological breakdown isn't possible in the traditional sense.  However, we can analyze its components:

* **inter-:**  From Latin *inter*, meaning "between," "among," or "amongst."  This prefix is widely used in English to indicate something happening between or among multiple entities.

* **cohesion:** From Latin *cohaerere*, meaning "to stick together," "to cling," or "to cohere." This word describes the action or state of uniting or sticking together.  It's a common word in physics, chemistry, and sociology.


While "intercohesions" is not a dictionary word, its meaning is readily understandable based on its component parts. It suggests the forces or factors that cause multiple things or parts to stick together or remain united.  The word likely implies a complex interplay of multiple cohesive forces.

Because it's not a standard word, providing examples of its usage in different grammatical tenses or as part of common phrases is not feasible.  The word would need to be established within a specific context or field before such examples could be generated meaningfully.
