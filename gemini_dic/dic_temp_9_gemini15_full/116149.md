The word "masar" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A word from another language:**  If it's from another language, please specify the language so I can provide a translation and explanation.
* **A neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or slang term not yet widely recognized.

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you'd like me to help.
