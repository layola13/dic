词源:  From Late Middle English: from Old French epitome, from Latin epitome, from Greek epitōmē ‘abridgment, summary’, from epi- ‘on, upon’ + temnein ‘to cut’.  The original meaning referred to a summary or abridgment of a longer work.  The modern meaning evolved from this, focusing on the representative essence rather than just the summary.
