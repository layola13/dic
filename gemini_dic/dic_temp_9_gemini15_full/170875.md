词源:  The word is a combination of "pseudo," from Greek ψευδής (pseudēs, "false, lying"), and "independent."  "Independent" originates from the Old French "independent,"  itself derived from the Latin "in-" (not) and "dependens" (hanging down, dependent).  Therefore, the word literally means "falsely independent".
