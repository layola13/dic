词源:
The verb "leak" originates from Old English *lēcan "to leak, to drip," related to Old Norse *leka "to leak," and possibly also to Old High German *lechan "to lick," suggesting an etymological connection to the idea of something dripping or flowing out.  The modern English word retained its core meaning of unintentional escape of fluids or information.
