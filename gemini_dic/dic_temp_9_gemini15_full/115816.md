markedness:/ˈmɑːrkɪdnəs/ | n. | 显著性；标记性；突出性 | The inherent salience or prominence of a linguistic element in relation to others.  This concept arises from the observation that some features of language are more commonly used or easier to perceive than others. For example, in English, the voiced sounds like /b/ and /d/ are generally considered more marked than their voiceless counterparts /p/ and /t/, as voiced sounds are often more frequently used and easier to produce.  Markedness is a key concept in phonology, morphology, and syntax. | The markedness of the word "unbreakable" is evident in its length and complexity compared to "breakable."  | 近义词：prominence, salience, distinctiveness | 反义词：unmarkedness, normality
