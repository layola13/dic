The word "nonquantifiable" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "quantifiable," which itself comes from the verb "quantify."  "Quantify" originates from the Latin word "quantitas," meaning "quantity," which in turn derives from the Latin word "quantus," meaning "how much" or "how great."  Therefore, the etymological roots trace back to the concept of measuring or expressing something as a numerical amount.
