词源:
The word "cross-examine" is a compound word.  "Cross" here means "to go across" or "to oppose," indicating a questioning that challenges previous testimony. "Examine" means to investigate carefully.  Thus, cross-examine means to question someone thoroughly and critically, often to challenge or contradict their statements.  The word originated in the legal field and reflects the adversarial nature of legal proceedings.
