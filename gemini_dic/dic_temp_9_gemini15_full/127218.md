词源:

The word "naughty" has a long and interesting history.  It comes from the Middle English word "noughty," which literally meant "worthless" or "of no value."  This in turn derives from Old English "nāwiht" meaning "nothing" or "naught."  Over time, the meaning shifted from simply meaning "worthless" to describing a person, usually a child, who behaves in a way that is mischievous or disobedient, but not necessarily malicious. The current sense of playfully mischievous emerged in the 16th century.
