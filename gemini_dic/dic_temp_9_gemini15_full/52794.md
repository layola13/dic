词源:  The word "diligence" originates from the Old French word "diligence," which itself comes from the Latin word "diligentia."  "Diligentia" is derived from "diligens," the present participle of "diligere," meaning "to love," "to choose," or "to care for."  The sense evolved to imply careful and attentive effort.
