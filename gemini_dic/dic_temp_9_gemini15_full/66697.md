exon:/ˈɛksɑːn/| n. |外显子|A segment of a DNA or RNA molecule containing information coding for a protein or peptide sequence.  Exons are transcribed into mRNA and are translated into proteins.  They are separated by introns, which are non-coding sequences. | Example: The gene contains three exons and two introns. 这个基因包含三个外显子和两个内含子。|近义词：coding sequence|反义词：intron


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the field of genetics and molecular biology and does not have verb conjugations or typical grammatical variations like the example word "what".  The usage is primarily in noun phrases and descriptions.

Example 1: The researchers identified a mutation in the third exon of the gene.  研究人员确定了该基因第三个外显子的突变。

Example 2:  Splicing removes introns and joins exons to form mature mRNA. 剪接去除内含子并将外显子连接起来形成成熟的mRNA。


PHRASE->
exon shuffling: 外显子重排
exon trapping: 外显子捕获
exon skipping: 外显子跳跃
alternative splicing of exons: 外显子可变剪接
exon amplification: 外显子扩增
