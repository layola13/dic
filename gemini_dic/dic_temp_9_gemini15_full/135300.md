词源:  The word is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "pastoral," which derives from the Latin word "pastoralis," meaning "of a shepherd."  "Pastoral" itself evolved to describe not only shepherds but also the idyllic rural life often depicted in literature and art.  Therefore, "nonpastorally" signifies the absence or opposite of these qualities.
