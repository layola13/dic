词源:

The word "examinership" is derived from the verb "examine" + the suffix "-ship," which denotes a state, condition, skill, or office.  "Examine" itself comes from the Old French "examiner," ultimately rooted in the Latin "examinare," meaning "to examine closely," formed from "ex-" (out, thoroughly) + "aminare" (to consider, investigate).  The "-ship" suffix signifies the quality or state of being an examiner, hence the position or role.
