词源:
The word "good" has a long and complex history, tracing back to Proto-Germanic *gōdaz,  meaning "good," "skillful," or "suitable."  This further descends from a Proto-Indo-European root,  *ǵʰédʰ-,  with related words appearing in various Indo-European languages suggesting a core meaning linked to “fitting” or “suitable.”  The evolution of the word reflects its multifaceted nature, encompassing moral goodness, quality, and skill.
