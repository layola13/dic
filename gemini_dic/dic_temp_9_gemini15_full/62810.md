enhancers:/ɪnˈhɑːnsərz/ | n. |增强子，促进剂|A DNA sequence that increases the rate of transcription of a gene.  Enhancers can be located far from the gene they regulate and can function in either orientation. |例句：The researchers identified several enhancers that regulate the expression of the gene.  研究人员确定了几种调节基因表达的增强子。

例句：These enhancers are crucial for the development of the nervous system. 这些增强子对于神经系统的发育至关重要。


近义词：activator, promoter (in some contexts)|反义词：silencer, repressor


词源:  The word "enhancer" is derived from the verb "enhance," meaning "to increase or improve the quality, value, or extent of."  The suffix "-er" transforms the verb into a noun, indicating something that enhances.  The biological meaning evolved from the observation that these DNA sequences enhance gene expression.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Enhancers regulate gene expression. = 增强子调节基因表达。
This enhancer increases the transcription rate. = 这个增强子提高了转录速率。


一般过去时:
Researchers discovered new enhancers. = 研究人员发现了新的增强子。
The experiment showed how enhancers worked. = 实验展示了增强子是如何工作的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified many enhancers. = 科学家们已经鉴定了许多增强子。
We have studied the effects of these enhancers. = 我们已经研究了这些增强子的作用。


过去完成时:
They had already located the enhancer before the analysis. = 他们在分析之前就已经找到了增强子。
The team had discovered the crucial role of enhancers. = 该团队已经发现了增强子的关键作用。


将来时:
We will investigate the function of these enhancers. = 我们将研究这些增强子的功能。
They will analyze the data to identify more enhancers. = 他们将分析数据以识别更多增强子。


虚拟语气:
If these were enhancers, the gene expression would increase. = 如果这些是增强子，基因表达就会增加。
I wish we had known about these enhancers earlier. = 我希望我们早点知道这些增强子。


被动语态:
The enhancers were identified through genomic sequencing. = 通过基因组测序鉴定了增强子。
Gene expression is regulated by enhancers. = 基因表达受增强子调控。


疑问句:
What are the characteristics of these enhancers? = 这些增强子的特征是什么？
Where are the enhancers located in the genome? = 增强子位于基因组的哪个位置？


否定句:
These sequences are not enhancers. = 这些序列不是增强子。
The mutation did not affect the enhancer activity. = 突变没有影响增强子的活性。


PHRASE->
gene enhancer = 基因增强子
enhancer element = 增强子元件
enhancer trap = 增强子诱捕
cis-acting enhancer =顺式作用增强子
enhancer-promoter interaction =增强子-启动子相互作用
