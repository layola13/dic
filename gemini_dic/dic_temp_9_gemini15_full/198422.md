词源:
The word "shrapnel" is derived from the name of Henry Shrapnel (1761-1842), a British military officer who invented a type of artillery shell filled with musket balls that burst to scatter them over a wide area.  The shell itself became known as a "shrapnel shell," and the scattered projectiles were then called "shrapnel."
