词源:
The word "dumbbell" is a compound word.  "Dumb" originally meant "stupid" or "mute," and "bell" refers to the bell-shaped weights at each end of the bar. The origin is unclear, but it is thought that the name arose because the early versions looked like bells, and the exercises were considered simple or basic, hence the association with "dumb". The term evolved over time, losing its pejorative connotation.
