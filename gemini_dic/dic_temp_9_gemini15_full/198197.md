词源:

The word "short-sightedness" is a compound word.  "Short" means lacking in extent or duration, while "sighted" relates to the ability to see.  "-ness" is a suffix forming nouns of state, condition, or quality.  Therefore, the word literally means "the state of having poor eyesight for distant objects" which has expanded to include the metaphorical meaning of lacking foresight. The etymology of "sight" traces back to Old English *sihþ, ultimately related to the Proto-Germanic *sekh- and Proto-Indo-European *sek-.
