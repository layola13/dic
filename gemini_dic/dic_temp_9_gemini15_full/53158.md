dipnoi:/ˈdɪpnoɪ/| n.|肺鱼类|Lungfishes are a group of lobe-finned fish that includes six extant species.  They are characterized by their ability to breathe air, using lungs in addition to gills.  They are found in freshwater habitats in Africa, South America, and Australia.  Their unique adaptations allow them to survive in environments that would be lethal to most other fish.|Lungfish are remarkable creatures that can survive out of water for extended periods. |近义词：lungfish|反义词:无
