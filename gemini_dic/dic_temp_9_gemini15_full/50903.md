The word "desertrice" does not exist as a single, established word in English.  It appears to be a combination of "desert" and "rice," possibly a made-up word or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  To help, we can analyze the individual words:


**desert:**

/ˈdɛzərt/ | n. v. |沙漠；功劳；应得之物；遗弃|A barren, sandy area with little or no vegetation;  To abandon or forsake;  Something deserved or earned. |The Sahara Desert is vast and unforgiving. |  wilderness, wasteland |jungle, oasis| n. v.


**rice:**

/raɪs/ | n. |米饭；稻谷| The grains of a cereal grass, used as food. | We had rice and beans for dinner. |grain, cereal|wheat, corn| n.



**Possible Interpretations and Usage (Hypothetical):**

If "desertrice" were intended to mean "rice grown in the desert," it could be used as a noun.  However, it is not a standard term.  One would more likely use a phrase like "desert-grown rice" or "rice cultivated in arid regions."


**Hypothetical Usage (if "desertrice" were accepted):**

* **Noun:**  "The farmers experimented with growing a new variety of desertrice." (This sentence uses the word as a noun, but it's important to note its non-standard nature.)

Without a proper definition and established usage, providing grammatical examples in various tenses, moods, and voices would be inappropriate and misleading.  The word's non-existence prevents a genuine linguistic analysis as requested in the format.
