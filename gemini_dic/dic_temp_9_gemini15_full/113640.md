词源:
The word "machine" ultimately derives from the late Latin word *machina*, meaning "a contrivance," "engine," or "military engine."  *Machina* itself is derived from the Greek word  *m?khanē* (μηχανή),  meaning "contrivance," "machine," "engine," or "device."  The Greek word had a broad range of meanings encompassing any sort of ingenious device or tool, extending beyond purely mechanical applications.  The word's journey from ancient Greek engineering concepts to its modern English usage reflects the evolution of technology and its impact on language.
