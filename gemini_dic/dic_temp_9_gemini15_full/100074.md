interpolator: /ɪnˈtɜːrpəleɪtər/ | n. | 插值器；内插器 | A device or program that calculates intermediate values between known data points.  It uses known data points to estimate values at points not explicitly measured or recorded.  For example, in image processing, an interpolator might fill in missing pixels based on the values of surrounding pixels. In other applications it could be used to predict a future value based on past data, or to smooth out noisy data. | Example: The software uses a linear interpolator to smooth the curve.  这个软件使用线性插值器来平滑曲线。 | 近义词: estimator, approximator | 反义词:  extrapolator (in some contexts)


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "What is..."  The usage focuses on its function and application in different fields.

Example 1:  The image interpolator significantly improved the resolution of the low-resolution image. 图像插值器显著提高了低分辨率图像的分辨率。

Example 2: A cubic spline interpolator provided a smoother curve than the linear interpolator. 三次样条插值器比线性插值器提供了更平滑的曲线。


PHRASE->
There aren't common idiomatic phrases directly using "interpolator."  Its usage is primarily technical and within specific contexts like signal processing, image processing, and numerical analysis.  Phrases involving it would be descriptive rather than idiomatic, for example:

"using a nearest-neighbor interpolator" 使用最近邻插值器
"applying a bicubic interpolator" 应用双三次插值器
"choosing the right interpolator for the task" 选择适合任务的插值器
"comparing different interpolator algorithms" 比较不同的插值器算法
"the performance of the interpolator" 插值器的性能


WORD ORIGIN->
The word "interpolator" is derived from the verb "interpolate," which itself comes from the Latin words "inter" (between) and "polare" (to polish, smooth, or finish).  The original meaning implied inserting something between existing things to make them smoother or more complete.  This sense of filling in gaps between known data points directly translates to its modern technical usage.
