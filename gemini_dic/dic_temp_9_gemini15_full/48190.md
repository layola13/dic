* **de-:**  A prefix indicating removal, reversal, or intensification.  Derived from Latin.
* **compound:**  Derived from the Latin "componere" (to put together), referring to something composed of multiple parts.
* **-able:** A suffix indicating capability or possibility.  Derived from Old English.
