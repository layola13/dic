photodimerization:/ˌfoʊtoʊdaɪmərɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 光二聚化 | The process where two molecules of the same compound, usually unsaturated organic molecules, combine to form a dimer upon exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light. This reaction often involves the formation of a cyclobutane ring. | Example:  The photodimerization of thymine bases in DNA can lead to mutations. 光照下胸腺嘧啶碱基的二聚化会导致突变。| 近义词: photocyclization | 反义词: photodissociation
