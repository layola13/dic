percarbureted:/ˌpɜːrkɑːrˈbʊreɪtɪd/ | adj. | 渗碳的，过量碳化的 |  Describes a substance, especially a fuel, that has been treated to increase its carbon content, often to enhance its combustion properties. This process is typically used in fuels to improve their burning efficiency or to adjust their properties for specific applications.  | Example: The percarbureted fuel mixture produced a more powerful explosion in the engine.  过量碳化的燃料混合物在发动机中产生了更强大的爆炸。 | 近义词：carbonized, enriched | 反义词：decarbonized, depleted |  词性：形容词

词源:
The word "percarbureted" is derived from "per-" (meaning thoroughly or completely) and "carbureted" (referring to the addition of carbon to a substance).  "Carbureted" itself comes from "carburetor," a device used to mix fuel and air in an internal combustion engine.  The ultimate root is from the Latin "carbo" meaning charcoal or carbon.
