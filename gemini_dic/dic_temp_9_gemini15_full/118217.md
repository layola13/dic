词源:
The word "meracious" is derived from the Latin word "verax," meaning "truthful" or "true."  The prefix "me-"  is a possible variant of a prefix meaning "great" or "very," though its use in "meracious" appears less common and the word's usage is relatively rare.  The word shares a close relationship with "veracious," which has a more established usage.
