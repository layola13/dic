词源:  The word "cozy" or "cosy" (the spelling varies between American and British English) comes from the Dutch word "koozie," meaning "little house" or "nest."  It ultimately derives from the Middle Dutch word "cosie," meaning "a small dwelling."  Over time, the meaning shifted from a physical dwelling to the feeling of comfort and warmth associated with such a space.
