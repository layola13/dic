nonconstants:/ˈnɒnkɒnstənts/ | n. |非常数，非常量|  Things that are not constant; variables or values that can change.  Nonconstants are the opposite of constants, which remain fixed or unchanging.  In mathematics, programming, and other fields, nonconstants represent dynamic aspects that can vary based on conditions or inputs.|Example: In the equation y = mx + c, m and c are constants while x and y are nonconstants.  在方程y = mx + c中，m和c是常量，而x和y是非常量。


The program uses several nonconstants to adjust the image's brightness and contrast dynamically. 该程序使用多个非常数来动态调整图像的亮度和对比度。|近义词：variables, parameters, dynamics |反义词：constants, invariants
