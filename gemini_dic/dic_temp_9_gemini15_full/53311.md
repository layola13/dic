词源:
Disablement is derived from the verb "disable," meaning "to deprive of ability," which in turn comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the verb "able" (meaning "having the power to").  The suffix "-ment" is a noun suffix indicating a state, condition, or result.  Therefore, disablement signifies the state of being deprived of ability or the condition of being disabled.
