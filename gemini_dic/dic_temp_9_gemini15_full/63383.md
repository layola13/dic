entoplastic: /ˌɛntəʊˈplæstɪk/ | adj. | 内塑的；内源性的 | Relating to or denoting the formation of internal structures or patterns within a substance, often through processes of self-organization or internal forces.  It often refers to the internal development or shaping of something, especially in a biological or geological context. | The entoplastic development of the crystal structure was remarkable.  内晶体的内塑性发育非常显著。|近义词：intrinsic, inherent, endogenous | 反义词：exogenous, extrinsic
