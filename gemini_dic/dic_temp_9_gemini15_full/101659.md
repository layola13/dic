词源:
The word "irregulous" is derived from the Latin prefix "ir-" (meaning "not") and the Latin word "regulus," meaning "little ruler" or "small king."  The sense of "rule" or "order" is carried through to the modern usage, making "irregulous" mean "not ruled" or "without rule," hence disorderly.  It's a relatively uncommon word, potentially appearing more frequently in older texts.
