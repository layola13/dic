ridgelet:/ˈrɪdʒlɪt/| n. |脊波,脊波变换|A ridgelet is a mathematical function used in ridgelet transform, a method for analyzing images and other data.  It is characterized by its ability to represent both point singularities and line singularities effectively. Unlike wavelets, which are effective at representing point singularities, ridgelets excel at representing directional information, making them particularly useful for image processing and analysis where linear features are prominent.|Example:  The ridgelet transform was applied to the image to enhance the detection of linear structures.  脊波变换被应用于图像以增强线性结构的检测。|近义词：wavelet (in some contexts)|反义词：N/A
