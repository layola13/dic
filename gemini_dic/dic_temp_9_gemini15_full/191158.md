词源:

The word is a combination of "scarecrow" and the suffix "-ish," which is used to form adjectives indicating resemblance or a slight degree of a quality.  "Scarecrow" itself comes from the words "scarecrows" (plural of scarecrow) which is a figure made to scare away birds.  The overall meaning developed to describe a person’s gaunt appearance resembling that of a scarecrow.
