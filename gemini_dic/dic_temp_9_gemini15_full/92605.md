USAGE->
This word is primarily used in discussions of prosody (the study of poetic meter and rhythm) and literary analysis. It doesn't have common everyday usage like "hello".  Therefore, providing example sentences illustrating tenses and moods isn't relevant.  Instead, here are examples of its usage in different contexts:

Example 1 (Describing meter): "Shakespeare's sonnets often employ iambic pentameter, a rhythm based on the repetition of the iambus."  = 莎士比亚的十四行诗经常使用抑扬格五音步，这是一种基于抑扬格重复的节奏。

Example 2 (Literary analysis): "The poem's use of spondees disrupts the otherwise consistent pattern of iambuses, creating a sense of dramatic tension." = 这首诗的使用双音节打破了原本一致的抑扬格模式，创造了一种戏剧性的紧张感。

Example 3 (Defining the term):  "An iambus is a metrical foot with an unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable." = 抑扬格是一个音步，由一个非重读音节后跟一个重读音节组成。


PHRASE->
