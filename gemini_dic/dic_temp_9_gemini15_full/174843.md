词源:  The word "racialist" is derived from the word "race" and the suffix "-ist," which is used to form nouns denoting a person who follows a particular belief or practice.  The term emerged in the 20th century as a more formal and less emotionally charged term than "racist," though both words are now often used interchangeably.
