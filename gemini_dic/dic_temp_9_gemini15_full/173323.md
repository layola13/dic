quasi-definite:/ˈkwɑːziˌdefɪnɪt/ | adj. | 准定的；近似确定的 |  Relating to or denoting a matrix that is not necessarily positive definite but has certain properties that resemble those of a positive definite matrix.  Specifically, a quasi-definite matrix is a symmetric matrix that can be partitioned into four blocks such that the diagonal blocks are positive definite and the off-diagonal blocks are zero. This structure allows for efficient algorithms in certain applications.  | Example:  The quasi-definite property of the stiffness matrix simplifies the solution of the finite element equations.  准定刚度矩阵的特性简化了有限元方程的求解。 | 近义词：almost definite, nearly definite | 反义词：indefinite, indeterminate |  无词性变化
