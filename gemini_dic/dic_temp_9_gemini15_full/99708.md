词源:

The word "interloper" comes from the combination of the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and the word "lope," which originally meant "to run" or "to leap."  The word evolved to describe someone who runs or leaps into a place or situation where they don't belong, implying an intrusive or unwelcome presence.
