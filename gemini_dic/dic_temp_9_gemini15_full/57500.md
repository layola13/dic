词源:
The word "draggle" originates from the Middle English word "dragglen," meaning "to drag or draw along," which itself descends from the Old Norse word "draga," meaning "to drag."  The addition of "-le" formed the frequentative or iterative suffix common in Middle English verbs, implying repeated or continuous action.
