The meaning often extends beyond literal physical vibrations to encompass the lingering emotional or psychological impact of an experience.  For example, the revibrations of a traumatic event might refer to the ongoing emotional distress and its effects. |例句：The revibrations of the earthquake were felt for days afterward. 地震的余波持续了好几天。 The revibrations of his harsh words lingered in the air. 他尖刻话语的回响在空气中久久回荡。|近义词：aftershocks, echoes, repercussions, reverberations|反义词：silence, stillness, calm|名词
