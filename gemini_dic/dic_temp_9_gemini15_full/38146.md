词源:

The word "compressibleness" is derived from the verb "compress" and the suffix "-ibility," which indicates a capacity or capability.  "Compress" itself comes from the Latin word "comprimere," meaning "to press together."  The "comp-" prefix denotes "together," and the "-press" root relates to pushing or squeezing.  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "compressible" into a noun, indicating a quality or state.
