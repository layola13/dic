词源:
The word "extremely" is derived from the Middle English word "extreemly," which itself comes from the Old French word "extreem," meaning "utmost" or "greatest." The suffix "-ly" is an adverbial suffix, indicating manner or degree.  The Old French word, in turn, traces back to the Latin word "extremus," the superlative form of "extremus," meaning "outermost" or "farthest."
