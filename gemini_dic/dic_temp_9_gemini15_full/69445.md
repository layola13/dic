The word "fehm" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  If you can provide context, it might be possible to guess the intended word.

2. **It's a dialectal word or slang:** It might be used informally in a specific region or community.  More information about its origin or usage would be helpful.

3. **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a name or place name.

4. **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language. If you can tell me the language it's from, I might be able to help.

Please provide more information so I can help you analyze the word correctly.
