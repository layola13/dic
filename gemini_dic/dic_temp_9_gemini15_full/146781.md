overidentified:/ˌoʊvərɪˈdɛntɪfaɪd/ | adj. |过度识别的，超定型的|  Describes a statistical model where there are more equations (restrictions) than unknowns.  In econometrics, this often means there are more instruments than endogenous regressors in an instrumental variables (IV) estimation.  This can lead to more precise estimates but also potentially biased estimates if the overidentifying restrictions are not valid. | The model was overidentified, leading to more precise but potentially biased parameter estimates.|近义词：overdetermined |反义词：underidentified


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The model is overidentified. = 模型是过度识别的。
This situation is overidentified in the literature. = 这种情况在文献中被过度识别。


一般过去时:
The model was overidentified in the previous study. = 在之前的研究中，模型是过度识别的。
The econometrician found that the model was overidentified. = 计量经济学家发现该模型是过度识别的。


现在完成时:
Researchers have found that many models have been overidentified. = 研究人员发现许多模型已被过度识别。
They have overidentified the key variables in their analysis.  = 他们在分析中过度识别了关键变量。


过去完成时:
The problem had been overidentified before the correction. = 在修正之前，这个问题已被过度识别。
We had realized that the model was overidentified before running the regression. = 我们在运行回归之前已经意识到模型是过度识别的。


将来时:
The new model will likely be overidentified. = 新模型很可能被过度识别。
Future research will focus on how to address overidentified models. = 未来的研究将集中在如何解决过度识别的模型。


虚拟语气:
If the model were overidentified, we would use a different estimation method. = 如果模型是过度识别的，我们将使用不同的估计方法。
It would be better if the model were not overidentified. = 如果模型不是过度识别的，那就更好了。


被动语态:

The issue of overidentification was addressed in the paper. = 本文探讨了过度识别的問題。


疑问句:
Is the model overidentified? = 模型是否过度识别？
Are there any problems with the model being overidentified? = 模型过度识别有什么问题吗？


否定句:
The model is not overidentified. = 模型没有过度识别。
The results are not biased because the model is not overidentified. = 结果没有偏差，因为模型没有过度识别。


PHRASE->
overidentified model = 过度识别的模型
overidentified system = 过度识别的系统
test of overidentifying restrictions = 过度识别约束检验
