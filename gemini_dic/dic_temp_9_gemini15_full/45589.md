词源:The word "currant" comes from the Old French word "corinthe," which referred to the dried grapes from Corinth, Greece. Initially, currants referred to these dried grapes, but later the name was transferred to the small berries, likely due to their similar size and dark color.  The berries themselves are native to Europe and Western Asia.
