The word "palanka" itself likely originates from a Turkic word meaning "fortified settlement" or "military post." Its usage broadened over time to encompass the broader meaning of a village in the Balkans, reflecting the historical influence of the Ottoman Empire in the region.  The specific etymology requires further research into the Turkic languages and dialects prevalent in the Balkans during the Ottoman period.
