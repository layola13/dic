词源:
The word "poem" comes from the Old French "poeme," which itself derives from the Latin "poema," and ultimately from the Greek "poiema" (ποίημα), meaning "a made thing," "a product," or "a work of art."  The Greek word is related to the verb "poiein" (ποιεῖν), meaning "to make" or "to create."  Thus, the word's origin highlights the act of creation inherent in the writing of poetry.
