mbe:/ˈɛmbiː/|abbr.|缩写|millibars (毫巴),  a unit of pressure|英文解析：MBE is an abbreviation for millibars, a unit of atmospheric pressure. One millibar is equal to 100 Pascals. It's commonly used in meteorology to report barometric pressure.|例句：The barometric pressure is 1012 mbe. = 气压是1012毫巴。  The weather forecast predicted a drop in mbe. = 天气预报预测气压下降。|近义词：Pascal (Pa), hectopascal (hPa)|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The pressure is 1015 mbe. = 气压是1015毫巴。
How many mbe is the atmospheric pressure today? = 今天大气压是多少毫巴？


一般过去时:
The mbe was lower yesterday. = 昨天的气压较低。
What was the mbe reading during the storm? = 暴风雨期间气压读数是多少？


现在完成时:
The mbe has dropped significantly. = 气压已显著下降。
Have you checked the mbe recently? = 你最近检查过气压了吗？


过去完成时:
The mbe had already fallen before the rain started. = 下雨开始前气压就已经下降了。
The scientist explained that the mbe had been unusually high. = 科学家解释说气压异常高。


将来时:
The mbe will likely rise tomorrow. = 气压明天可能会上升。
What will the mbe be like during the flight? = 飞行期间气压会怎样？


虚拟语气:
If the mbe were higher, the weather would be better. = 如果气压更高，天气就会更好。
I wish the mbe was more stable. = 我希望气压更稳定。


被动语态:
The mbe is measured using a barometer. = 气压是用气压计测量的。
The mbe was carefully monitored throughout the experiment. = 整个实验过程中都仔细监测了气压。


疑问句:
What is the current mbe? = 当前气压是多少？
What mbe is considered normal? = 什么气压被认为是正常的？


否定句:
The mbe is not stable today. = 今天气压不稳定。
The mbe didn't change much during the day. = 白天气压变化不大。
