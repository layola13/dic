/ˈdʒɛtɪnɪsɪz/ | n. | 喷射性；射流性 |  The word "jettiness's" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be an unconventional or possibly erroneous formation.  It seems to be attempting to convey the possessive form of "jettiness," which itself is not a commonly used word. "Jettiness" would refer to the quality or state of being jet-like, perhaps implying speed, force, or darkness. However, the added apostrophe-s ("'s") suggests possession, resulting in a grammatically awkward and unusual term. There are no standard dictionaries or corpora listing this word.  Therefore, no proper usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analyses can be provided.  The word needs to be replaced with a more appropriate and standard English equivalent depending on the intended meaning.
