词源:
The word "gooseberry" is of uncertain origin.  It is believed to be derived from the Old French *groseille, ultimately from a Germanic root, possibly related to a word meaning "rough" or "hairy," referring to the plant's thorny branches.  The "goose" part is likely a folk etymology, a popular but incorrect explanation for the name.
