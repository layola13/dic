nanomole:/ˈnænəʊmoʊl/|/ˈnænəˌmoʊl/| n. |纳摩尔|A nanomole (nmol) is a unit of measurement in chemistry and biology, representing one billionth of a mole (10^-9 mol).  It's used to express the amount of substance, particularly in experiments dealing with very small quantities of materials, such as in biochemistry and molecular biology.  The amount of substance is related to the number of molecules or atoms present. |The experiment required only a nanomole of the enzyme to catalyze the reaction.  实验只需要一纳摩尔的酶就能催化反应。

The concentration of the protein was measured in nanomoles per liter. 蛋白质的浓度以纳摩尔/升为单位测量。|micromole, picomole|macromole|
