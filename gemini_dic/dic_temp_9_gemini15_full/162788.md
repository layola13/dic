/ˌpriːˈbɔɪhʊd/| n. |童年早期，少年时代早期|A preboyhood refers to the period of a child's life before they reach boyhood, typically encompassing infancy and early childhood.  It is not a standard or commonly used word and lacks a precise definition.  The term is constructed by combining "pre" (meaning before) with "boyhood". Because of its lack of common usage, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage is difficult and potentially misleading.|例句:The memories from his preboyhood were hazy and indistinct. 他童年早期的记忆模糊不清。 |近义词: infancy, early childhood|反义词: adolescence, adulthood
