The word "overpartialnesses" does not exist in standard English.  It appears to be a neologism, possibly a deliberate misspelling or a creative coinage.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  The word seems to be formed by combining "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great extent), "partial" (meaning biased or favoring one side), and the suffix "-ness" (indicating a state or quality).  The addition of a second "-ness" is unusual and grammatically incorrect in standard English.

To illustrate how a similar, correctly formed word would be analyzed, let's consider "partialness":


partialness: /ˈpɑːrʃəl.nəs/ | n. |偏袒，偏心 |The state or quality of being partial; bias or favoritism.  |Example:  Her blatant partialness towards her own child was upsetting to the other students.  她的偏袒自己的孩子让其他学生感到不安。|近义词：bias, prejudice, favoritism |反义词：impartiality, fairness, objectivity
