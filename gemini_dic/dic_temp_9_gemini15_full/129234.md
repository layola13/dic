noctilucine: /ˌnɒktɪˈluːsɪn/ | n. |夜光素|  A bioluminescent protein found in certain dinoflagellates, responsible for their ability to produce light.  It is a luciferin, meaning it's the light-emitting substrate in a bioluminescent reaction.  Further research is ongoing to fully understand its structure and mechanism. |The noctilucine in the dinoflagellates created a stunning spectacle of bioluminescence in the ocean. 夜光素使夜光藻在海洋中创造了令人惊叹的生物发光景象。|  Luciferin (general term for light-emitting substrates),  bioluminescent protein |  (No direct antonym, as it describes a specific substance) | n.
