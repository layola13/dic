词源:
From Middle English emperour, from Old French emperere, from Latin imperator, from imperare "to command".  The word ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *aper- "to fit, join," which also gave rise to words like "apt" and "appropriate."  The sense of command developed from the idea of one who brings together and controls a vast domain.
