词源:
The word "endurant" is derived from the verb "endure," meaning "to suffer something painful or difficult without complaint," and ultimately from the Old French word "endurer" and the Latin word "indurare" meaning "to harden."  The suffix "-ant" is an adjective-forming suffix indicating "capable of" or "characterized by".
