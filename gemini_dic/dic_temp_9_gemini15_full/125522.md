multisets:/ˈmʌltiˌsɛts/| n. |多重集，多集|A multiset is a generalization of the concept of a set that, unlike a set, allows multiple instances of the multiset's elements.  For example, {a, a, b} is a multiset, but {a, b} is its underlying set.  The number of times an element occurs in a multiset is called its multiplicity. |Example: The multiset {1, 1, 2, 2, 3} contains two 1s, two 2s, and one 3. The underlying set is {1, 2, 3}.|近义词：bag (in some contexts)|反义词：set (in the sense of a unique collection of elements)|名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in mathematics and computer science, so tense conjugations don't apply in the same way as with verbs.  Instead, examples will illustrate its usage in different mathematical contexts.

Example 1 (Set Theory):
The multiset M = {a, a, b, c, c, c} has a multiplicity of 2 for 'a', 1 for 'b', and 3 for 'c'. = 多重集M = {a, a, b, c, c, c} 中，'a' 的多重度为2，'b' 的多重度为1，'c' 的多重度为3。


Example 2 (Database):
A database query might return a multiset of results, where duplicate entries are allowed. = 数据库查询可能会返回一个多重集的结果，其中允许重复项。


Example 3 (Combinatorics):
The number of multisets of size k from a set of size n is given by a combination with repetition.  = 从大小为 n 的集合中选择大小为 k 的多重集的数量由带重复的组合给出。


Example 4 (Formal Language Theory):
In formal language theory, a multiset can be used to represent the count of each terminal symbol in a derivation. = 在形式语言理论中，多重集可以用来表示推导中每个终结符的计数。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "multisets".  The term is used technically within its specific fields.
