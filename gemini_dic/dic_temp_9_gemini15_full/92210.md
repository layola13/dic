PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "hypertechnically". The word itself is used as an adverb modifying verbs.


词源:
The word is a combination of "hyper-" (meaning excessively or beyond) and "technically" (meaning in a manner relating to technology or technical skill).  Therefore, it literally means "excessively technically."
