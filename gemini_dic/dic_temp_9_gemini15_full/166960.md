The word "prestriction" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a newly coined word, a technical term from a specific field, or a word from a fictional language.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis according to the format.
