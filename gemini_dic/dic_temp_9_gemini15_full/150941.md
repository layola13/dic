词源:
From Middle French *paralyser, from Late Latin paralys-, stem of paralysis, from Greek παράλυσις (parálysis) "paralysis," from παράλυτος (parálytos) "struck with paralysis," from παρά (pará) "beside, beyond" + λύειν (lýein) "to loosen, unbind."  Ultimately, the word reflects the idea of a loosening or loss of control over the body's functions.
