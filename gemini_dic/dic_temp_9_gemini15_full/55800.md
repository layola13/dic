词源:  Derived from the verb "divert," meaning to distract or entertain,  plus the adverbial suffix "-ingly".  The root "di-" suggests "away" or "aside," while "vert" comes from the Latin "vertere," meaning "to turn." Thus, "diverting" originally meant "turning aside" attention, and now implies pleasantly turning aside from boredom or routine.
