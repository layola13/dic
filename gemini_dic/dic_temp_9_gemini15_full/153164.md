pelicosauria:/ˌpɛlɪkəˈsɔəriə/| n. |獸孔類, 獸孔亞綱 | Pelicosauria is an extinct group of synapsids that were among the earliest amniotes to evolve. They were characterized by a sail-like structure on their backs, which is believed to have been used for thermoregulation. Pelicosaurians were diverse group, ranging in size from small to large, and occupied a variety of ecological niches. Many were carnivores, others herbivores.  | Example: Dimetrodon, a well-known pelicosaur, possessed a large sail on its back.  二齒獸，一種著名的獸孔類，背上長有巨大的帆。|近义词:synapsid (更广义的分类)|反义词:None (灭绝的生物)|
