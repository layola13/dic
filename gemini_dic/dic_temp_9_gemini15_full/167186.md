The word "pretempt" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word not yet widely accepted.
