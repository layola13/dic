neocene:/ˈniːoʊsiːn/| n. |新近纪|The Neocene is a proposed geological epoch spanning from roughly 5 million years ago to the present day.  It's a relatively new term, and not yet universally accepted within the geological community. The Neocene is characterized by significant changes in climate, flora, fauna, and the emergence of humans as a dominant species. Its boundaries are still under discussion, and some geologists prefer to continue using the Pleistocene and Holocene epochs.|The Neocene epoch saw the rise of human civilization and its significant impact on the planet.|近义词：Late Cenozoic (a broader term)|反义词：Paleocene (an earlier epoch)|名词
