词源:

The word "polyadelphian" is derived from the Greek words:

* **poly- (πολύ-)**: meaning "many"
* **adelphos (ἀδελφός)**: meaning "brother"

In botanical context,  "adelphos" refers to stamens, which are often considered as "brothers" in their arrangement within the flower. Thus, polyadelphous describes the condition where many stamens are joined together into multiple bundles or groups.
