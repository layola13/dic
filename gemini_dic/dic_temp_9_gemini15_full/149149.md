oxindol:/ˈɒksɪndɒl/ | n. | 恶唑烷酮 | Oxindoles are a class of heterocyclic compounds containing a five-membered ring with two carbon atoms, one nitrogen atom, and two oxygen atoms.  They are found in many natural products and pharmaceuticals, and are often used as building blocks in organic synthesis.  Their structure features a lactam ring fused to a benzene ring. | Oxindoles are used in the synthesis of various pharmaceuticals and natural products.  For example, they are found in the structure of some alkaloids and are important intermediates in the synthesis of certain drugs. | 近义词:  (No direct synonyms, as it refers to a specific chemical structure) | 反义词: (No direct antonyms)
