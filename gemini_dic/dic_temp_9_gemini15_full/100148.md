interradiated: /ˌɪntərˈeɪdieɪtɪd/ | adj. | 互相辐射的；相互照射的 |  Exposed to radiation from multiple sources simultaneously.  The term implies a reciprocal exchange of radiation between objects or areas. | 例句：The experiment involved interradiated samples of uranium and plutonium.  实验涉及铀和钚的互相辐射样本。


The samples were interradiated, resulting in a complex energy transfer. 样本经过互相照射，导致复杂的能量转移。| 近义词：mutually irradiated, cross-irradiated | 反义词：shielded, unisolated
