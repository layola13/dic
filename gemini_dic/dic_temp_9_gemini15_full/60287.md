词源:The word "egghead" is a relatively recent coinage, appearing in the mid-20th century. It combines "egg," a symbol of fragility and sometimes foolishness, and "head," suggesting intelligence or intellect. The juxtaposition creates a somewhat ironic and often humorous image of someone whose intellectual prowess is contrasted with a perceived lack of social skills or practical knowledge.  The term's emergence coincided with a growing appreciation of intellectualism in the post-war era, but it also reflected a degree of skepticism towards overly academic or theoretical pursuits.
