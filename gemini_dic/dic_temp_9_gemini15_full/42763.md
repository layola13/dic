词源:
The word "countries" is the plural of "country".  "Country" comes from the Old French "contree," meaning "region," "district," or "tract of land," ultimately deriving from the Latin "contrada," meaning "region," which is related to "contra," meaning "against" or "opposite," suggesting a region set against or distinct from another.
