recondensation:/ˌriːkɒndɛnˈseɪʃən/ | n. | 再凝结；再冷凝 | The process by which a gas or vapor changes back into a liquid.  This often occurs after a previous vaporization or sublimation process.  It's a key concept in many scientific fields, including meteorology and chemistry. | Example: The recondensation of water vapor in the atmosphere leads to cloud formation.  再凝结的大气水汽导致云的形成。 The recondensation of the refrigerant is crucial for the efficient operation of the air conditioner. 制冷剂的再冷凝对于空调的高效运行至关重要。 | 近义词：condensation, liquefaction | 反义词：vaporization, evaporation
