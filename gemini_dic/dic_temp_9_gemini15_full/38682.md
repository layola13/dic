USAGE->

一般现在时:
The gas is condensable under low temperature. = 这种气体在低温下是可冷凝的。
This substance is condensable under high pressure. =  这种物质在高压下是可冷凝的。


一般过去时:
The steam was condensable in the cooling tower. = 蒸汽在冷却塔中是可以冷凝的。
The vapor was condensable after it passed through the filter. = 蒸汽通过过滤器后是可冷凝的。


现在完成时:
The engineers have found that the gas has been condensable. = 工程师们发现这种气体是可以冷凝的。
Many experiments have shown that this substance is condensable. = 许多实验表明这种物质是可冷凝的。


过去完成时:
Scientists had determined that the substance had been condensable before the experiment. = 科学家们在实验前已经确定该物质是可冷凝的。
They had discovered that the gas had been condensable at a lower temperature than they initially thought. = 他们发现这种气体在比他们最初认为更低的温度下是可冷凝的。


将来时:
The new technology will make the gas condensable at higher temperatures. = 新技术将使这种气体在更高的温度下也能冷凝。
We believe the process will make the substance condensable more efficiently. = 我们相信这个过程将使物质更有效地冷凝。


虚拟语气:
If the temperature were lower, the gas would be condensable. = 如果温度更低，这种气体就能冷凝。
If the pressure were higher, the vapor would be more readily condensable. = 如果压力更高，蒸汽将更容易冷凝。


被动语态:
The gas can be condensed easily because it is highly condensable. = 这种气体很容易冷凝，因为它很容易冷凝。
The vapor was condensed rapidly because it was condensable at room temperature. = 蒸汽迅速凝结，因为它在室温下即可冷凝。


疑问句:
Is this gas condensable under normal atmospheric pressure? = 这种气体在正常大气压下能否冷凝？
Are all gases condensable under sufficiently low temperatures? = 所有气体在足够低的温度下都能冷凝吗？


否定句:
That gas is not condensable at room temperature. = 那种气体在室温下不能冷凝。
The substance is not readily condensable under these conditions. = 在这些条件下，这种物质不容易冷凝。


PHRASE->
highly condensable = 高度可冷凝的
easily condensable = 易于冷凝的
readily condensable = 容易冷凝的
partially condensable = 部分可冷凝的
less condensable =  较难冷凝的
