manchukuo:/ˌmænˈtʃuːkwoʊ/| n. |满洲国|Manchukuo was a puppet state of the Empire of Japan in Manchuria from 1932 to 1945.  It was established by Japan after the Mukden Incident, a staged event used as a pretext for the Japanese invasion of Manchuria.  The name "Manchukuo" is a combination of "Manchu" and "guo" (国), meaning "country" in Chinese. The regime was largely controlled by Japanese officials and military personnel, with a figurehead emperor from the Aisin Gioro clan (the former Qing Dynasty imperial family). The state was never internationally recognized except by a few other Axis powers.  |The establishment of Manchukuo was a major step in Japan's expansionist ambitions in Asia and a key factor leading to the Second Sino-Japanese War.|近义词:puppet state, client state|反义词:independent nation, sovereign state|名词
