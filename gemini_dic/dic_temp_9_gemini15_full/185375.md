retrofracted:/ˌretrəʊˈfræktɪd/| adj.| 反向折射的 |  Refers to light or other waves that have been bent back upon themselves after passing through a medium. This is a less common term, often used in specialized scientific contexts, particularly in optics and physics. It implies a reversal of direction due to refraction. | Example: The laser beam was retrofracted by the prism, returning almost exactly to its source.  激光束被棱镜反向折射，几乎精确地返回到它的源头。| 近义词：back-reflected, reversed (in the context of wave direction)| 反义词：refracted (in the sense of simple bending, not reversal)

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The prism retrofracts the light. = 棱镜反向折射光线。
The lens retrofracts the incoming rays. = 透镜反向折射入射光线。

一般过去时:
The experiment retrofracted the beam successfully. = 实验成功地反向折射了光束。
The scientist observed that the material retrofracted the light. = 科学家观察到该材料反向折射了光线。


现在完成时:
The researchers have retrofracted the signal multiple times. = 研究人员已经多次反向折射了信号。
The device has successfully retrofracted the laser beam. = 该设备已成功反向折射了激光束。


过去完成时:
The light had been retrofracted before it reached the detector. = 光线到达探测器之前已经被反向折射了。
They had already retrofracted the beam several times in the prior tests. = 在之前的测试中，他们已经多次反向折射了光束。


将来时:
The new technology will retrofract the waves with greater precision. = 新技术将更精确地反向折射波。
We will retrofract the light to create a unique effect. = 我们将反向折射光线以创造独特的效果。


虚拟语气:
If the material were perfectly retrofractive, the light would return precisely to its origin. = 如果材料是完美的反向折射的，光线将精确地返回到它的起源。
I wish the experiment had retrofracted the light more efficiently. = 我希望实验能更有效地反向折射光线。


被动语态:
The light was retrofracted by the special lens. = 光线被特殊的透镜反向折射了。
The signal is being retrofracted by the experimental setup. = 信号正在被实验装置反向折射。


疑问句:
Is the light retrofracted by this material? = 光线会被这种材料反向折射吗？
How efficiently is the light retrofracted by the prism? = 棱镜反向折射光线的效率如何？


否定句:
The material did not retrofract the light effectively. = 该材料没有有效地反向折射光线。
The lens does not retrofract the light at this angle. = 透镜在这个角度不会反向折射光线。
