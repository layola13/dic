词源:

corruptibility derives from the Latin word "corruptibilitas," formed from "corruptus" (corrupted, spoiled) + "-ibilitas" (suffix indicating capacity or susceptibility).  The root "corruptus" itself comes from "corrumpere," meaning "to break," "to destroy," or "to ruin."  Therefore, the word's etymology reflects its meaning: the capacity or susceptibility to be broken, destroyed, or morally ruined.
