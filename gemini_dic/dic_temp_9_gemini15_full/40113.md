词源:

The word "contemningly" derives from the verb "contemn," which comes from the Latin word "contemnere."  "Contemnere" is a compound of "con-" (intensive prefix) and "temnere" (to despise, scorn, disregard).  The "-ingly" suffix turns the adjective "contemning" (present participle of contemn) into an adverb, indicating the manner in which an action is performed.
