The word "shadde" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "shade," "shed," or "shred."  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **It's a regional dialect word:**  Some words are used only in specific regions or communities.

3. **It's a newly coined word or slang:**  New words are constantly being created, but without more context, it's impossible to define.

4. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name or place name.
