词源:
The word "queer" ultimately derives from the Old English word "cwear," meaning "crooked" or "twisted." Over time, its meaning shifted, acquiring connotations of strangeness and oddness.  In the 20th century, it became a derogatory term used against LGBTQ+ individuals, but has since been reclaimed as a term of self-identification by many.  "Queerest" is simply the superlative form, indicating the highest degree of queerness.
