photophore:/ˈfoʊtoʊfɔːr/| n. |发光器；发光体；（某些海洋动物的）发光器官|A photophore is a light-producing organ found in certain animals, such as deep-sea fish and squid.  It is used for various purposes, including attracting prey, communication, and camouflage. |例句：Many deep-sea creatures use photophores to lure smaller fish into their grasp. 许多深海生物利用发光器来诱捕小鱼。

The anglerfish uses its bioluminescent photophore as a lure to attract prey. 琵琶鱼利用其生物发光的发光器作为诱饵来吸引猎物。|近义词：light organ, luminous organ|反义词：None specifically, but could be considered opposite of a non-luminous organ.
