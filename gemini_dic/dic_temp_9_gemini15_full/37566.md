Etymology:  The word "commotion" comes from the Old French word "commotioun," which itself derives from the Latin word "commotio," meaning "shaking," "agitation," or "disturbance." The Latin word is formed from the prefix "com-" (together, thoroughly) and "movere" (to move).  Therefore, the word's root signifies a thorough shaking or moving, leading to the sense of disorder and unrest.
