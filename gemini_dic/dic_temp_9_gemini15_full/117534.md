WORD ORIGIN->

The phrase is a self-explanatory compound noun phrase. "Meeting" refers to a coming together, and "of minds" specifies that this coming together is of people's thoughts and opinions.  It's a relatively modern idiom, likely arising from the increasing emphasis on collaboration and consensus in modern society and business. There isn't a traceable single etymological origin point like some older words.
