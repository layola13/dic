词源:
The word "maroon" comes from the French word "marron," meaning "chestnut."  This refers to the color of chestnuts, which is a dark brownish-red.  The nautical sense of "to maroon" developed later, likely from the practice of leaving people stranded on islands, possibly using a chestnut-colored boat.
