postpositions:/ˌpəʊstˈpəzɪʃənz/ | n. |后置词 |Postpositions are words placed after the word they modify, similar to prepositions but following the word instead of preceding it.  They often indicate grammatical relations such as location, time, or manner.  Many languages utilize postpositions, while English primarily employs prepositions. |Examples:  The house by the river. (preposition)  The river beside the house. (postposition, in some analyses).  The event after the meeting. (preposition)  The meeting after the event. (postposition, in some analyses).|近义词：postfixes, enclitics (in some contexts)|反义词：prepositions|名词


USAGE->
This word doesn't have verb conjugations like "what".  Postpositions themselves don't conjugate; rather, the word they are attached to does.  The usage examples below show how postpositions function grammatically in different sentence structures within languages that utilize them.  Note that English uses prepositions far more frequently.

Example in a language using postpositions (Korean):

Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) sentence structure:  집에-서 (jip-e-seo) = at home

Here "-e" and "-seo" are postpositions indicating location.  "Jip" (집) means "house".  The entire phrase "jip-e-seo" translates to "at home".

Another example in Korean:

나는 책을 읽었다 (naneun chaegeul ilgeotda) = I read the book

Here "-eul" is a postposition marking the direct object ("the book").  The verb "ilgeotda" (읽었다) is conjugated for past tense.  The postposition is attached to "chaegeul" (책을) the direct object of the sentence.


PHRASE->
The concept of "postpositional phrases" exists, where the postposition and the word it modifies function together.  However, there are not common idioms or phrases specifically built around the word "postpositions" in English, as English doesn't heavily use them.  Therefore, no common phrases can be provided directly related to the word "postpositions".

Instead, examples of postpositional phrases in Korean (as an example of a language that uses postpositions extensively):


집으로 (jip-euro): towards the house
학교에서 (hakkyo-eseo): at school
나에게 (naege): to me
그에게서 (geuge-eseo): from him
너를 위해 (neoreul wihae): for you


Note:  The English translations above highlight the postpositional function, which is less explicit in English grammar.  In Korean, the meaning and grammatical role are directly derived from the postposition attached to the noun.
