词源：

The word "overrideable" is derived from the verb "override," which itself is a combination of "over" (meaning "above" or "beyond") and "ride" (meaning "to control" or "to dominate").  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or possibility. Therefore, "overrideable" literally means "capable of being overridden."  The underlying concept comes from the practice of overriding methods in object-oriented programming, where a child class can redefine a method inherited from its parent class.
