词源:
The word "hundredfold" is a combination of "hundred" and "fold."  "Hundred" is of Old English origin, while "-fold" is a suffix meaning "times" or "multiplied by".  The suffix "-fold" shares Germanic roots with words like "fold" (meaning "to double") and ultimately traces back to Proto-Germanic *falþō.
