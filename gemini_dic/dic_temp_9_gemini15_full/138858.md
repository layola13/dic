The word "nursepond" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or common usage.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or niche vocabulary.

To provide a helpful response, I need clarification:

1. **Is this a misspelling?**  If so, please provide the intended word.
2. **Is this a neologism or term from a specific field?** If so, please provide context (where did you encounter this word?).  This context might allow me to infer its meaning and potential usage.


Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.
