词源：duty (n.) + bound (adj.)  "Duty" originates from Old French "devoir" (to owe), ultimately from Latin "dēbēre" (to owe). "Bound" comes from Old English "bunden," past participle of "bindan" (to bind), signifying being obligated or constrained.  The combination thus means being "bound" by one's "duty."
