词源:
The word "revolt" comes from the Old French word "revolter," meaning "to turn around," "to turn over," or "to rebel." This in turn derives from the Latin word "revolvere," which has the same basic meaning of "to turn around" or "to revolve."  The sense of rebellion developed from the idea of a turning away from established order.
