/ˌoʊvərˌmæɡˈnɛtɪkli/ | adv. | 过度磁性地；磁力过强地 |  Describes something exhibiting excessive magnetic properties or influence.  It implies a level of magnetism beyond what is typical or expected, potentially leading to unwanted effects.  This word is rarely used and is largely a neologism (newly coined word) formed by combining "over-" (excessively) with "magnetically" (in a manner relating to magnetism). |  The experiment failed because the materials were overmagnetically charged, causing them to attract uncontrollably.  = 实验失败了，因为材料的磁性过强，导致它们无法控制地相互吸引。  The overmagnetically strong field disrupted the delicate instruments. = 磁场过强，扰乱了精密仪器。 |  excessively magnetic, hypermagnetic (potential near synonyms, but not perfect equivalents) |  undermagnetically (antonym, but rarely used) | adv.
