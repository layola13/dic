corrosivity:/kəˌroʊsɪvɪti/ | n. |腐蚀性，侵蚀性 | The ability of a substance to cause irreversible damage to a material, typically by chemical reaction.  This often involves the deterioration or destruction of the material's structure.  | Example: The high corrosivity of sulfuric acid requires careful handling and storage.  硫酸的高腐蚀性要求小心处理和储存。 The corrosivity of seawater is a major concern for marine structures. 海水的腐蚀性是海洋结构物的主要问题。 |近义词：erosiveness,destructiveness |反义词：inertness,passivity
