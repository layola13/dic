Etymology:

The word "multipaned" is a compound word formed from:

* **multi-**:  A prefix meaning "many" or "multiple."  It comes from Latin *multus* meaning "much, many."

* **paned**:  An adjective referring to a window or door having panes of glass.  "Pane" itself derives from the Old French *paine*, meaning a "piece of bread" or "a flat piece."  Its application to glass panes likely comes from the visual similarity of the rectangular shape.
