词源:
The word "outflame" is a relatively rare word, formed by combining the prefix "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent" or "beyond") with the verb "flame" (meaning "to burn with a flame").  It's a relatively modern coinage, not found in older dictionaries, likely created to emphasize the intensity of the burning.
