词源:
The word "polishers" is derived from the verb "to polish," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "poliss-, polir," meaning "to polish" or "to make smooth."  This in turn has roots in the Late Latin word "polire," which shares a common ancestor with the Greek word "psalein," meaning "to scrape" or "to rub."  The "-er" suffix indicates an agent or doer of the action.
