词源:
The word "prim" comes from the Old French word "primer," meaning "to prepare," "to make ready," or "to adorn."  Over time, its meaning shifted to describe something that is prepared or set in a formal, precise, and often overly meticulous manner.  The connection lies in the association of careful preparation with a precise and formal appearance.
