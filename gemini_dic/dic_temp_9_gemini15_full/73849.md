USAGE->
This word is a possessive form and doesn't have verb conjugations like the example word "what".  It's a noun in the possessive case.  Therefore, typical verb tenses don't apply.

PHRASE->
No common phrases exist directly using "formulae's".  The word is used within a phrase describing something about the formulae, rather than as a stand-alone phrase.  For example:  "The formulae's application to this problem is straightforward."
