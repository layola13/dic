granularity:/ˌɡrænjʊˈlærəti/| n. |粒度；细粒度；颗粒度 |The level of detail in data or a system.  It refers to the size of the individual pieces of information or the level of precision in a measurement or representation. For example, a high granularity map shows more detail than a low granularity map.  |例句：The granularity of the data was too coarse to support detailed analysis. 数据的粒度太粗，无法支持详细分析。

The system's granularity needs to be improved to provide more precise information. 系统的粒度需要改进以提供更精确的信息。|近义词：detail, fineness, precision |反义词：coarseness, crudeness


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The granularity of the data affects the analysis. = 数据的粒度影响分析。
High granularity provides better insights. = 高粒度提供更好的洞察力。


一般过去时:
The granularity of the previous report was insufficient. = 上一份报告的粒度不足。
We increased the granularity for better results. = 我们提高了粒度以获得更好的结果。


现在完成时:
They have improved the granularity of their models. = 他们已经改进了模型的粒度。
We have seen the benefits of higher granularity. = 我们已经看到了更高粒度的益处。


过去完成时:
The analysis had already been done with low granularity. = 分析已经以低粒度完成。
They had not considered the impact of granularity. = 他们没有考虑粒度的影响。


将来时:
We will increase the granularity of the next report. = 我们将在下一份报告中提高粒度。
They will need finer granularity for accurate forecasting. = 他们需要更细的粒度才能进行准确的预测。


虚拟语气:
If the granularity were higher, the results would be more accurate. = 如果粒度更高，结果将更准确。
I wish the data had higher granularity. = 我希望数据有更高的粒度。


被动语态:
The granularity was determined by the available resources. = 粒度由可用资源决定。
The analysis is being conducted with a specific granularity. = 分析正在以特定的粒度进行。


疑问句:
What is the granularity of this dataset? = 这个数据集的粒度是多少？
What level of granularity is required for this project? = 这个项目需要什么级别的粒度？


否定句:
The granularity is not fine enough for this task. = 这个任务的粒度不够精细。
The system does not support that level of granularity. = 系统不支持那种粒度级别。


PHRASE->
high granularity = 高粒度
low granularity = 低粒度
temporal granularity = 时间粒度
spatial granularity = 空间粒度
data granularity = 数据粒度


词源:
Granularity derives from the word "granule," meaning a small grain or particle.  The suffix "-arity" is used to form nouns indicating a quality or state, thus "granularity" refers to the quality or state of being granular,  or composed of granules.  The word's meaning has extended metaphorically to refer to the level of detail in various contexts.
