decarburization:/ˌdiːkɑːrbəraɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 脱碳；除碳 | The process of removing carbon from iron or steel.  This is often done to improve the material's properties, such as ductility and malleability. | Example: The decarburization process significantly improved the steel's toughness.  脱碳过程显著提高了钢的韧性。 The decarburization of the iron resulted in a more workable metal. 铁的脱碳使其成为更容易加工的金属。| 近义词： decarbonization | 反义词：carbonization |


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Decarburization improves the material's properties. = 脱碳改善了材料的性能。
The process of decarburization is complex. = 脱碳过程很复杂。


一般过去时:
The engineers decarburized the steel. = 工程师们对钢进行了脱碳处理。

将来时:
We will decarburize the metal next week. = 我们下周将对金属进行脱碳处理。
The factory will implement a new decarburization method. = 工厂将实施一种新的脱碳方法。


虚拟语气:
If we decarburized the steel, it would be more ductile. = 如果我们对钢进行脱碳处理，它会更具延展性。
It would be beneficial if they had used a better decarburization technique. = 如果他们使用了更好的脱碳技术，那将是有益的。


被动语态:
The steel was decarburized in a controlled atmosphere. = 钢在受控气氛下进行脱碳处理。
