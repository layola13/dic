词源：The word "pocketbook" combines "pocket," referring to a small container for carrying items, and "book," originally referring to a bound collection of pages.  The sense of "small bag" evolved from the idea of a small, book-shaped bag. The use of "pocketbook" to mean a small, inexpensive book is a later development.
