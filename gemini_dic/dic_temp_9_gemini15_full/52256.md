词源:
The word "dibutyl" is a combination of "di-" and "butyl".

* "di-":  A prefix meaning "two" or "twice".  It comes from Greek "di-" (δις).

* "butyl": Refers to a four-carbon alkyl group derived from butane.  The "-yl" suffix is a common chemical suffix indicating an alkyl group.  "Butane" itself originates from butyric acid, a fatty acid found in butter (Latin: butyrum).
