词源:
The word "eliminate" comes from the Latin word "eliminare," which is a combination of "e-" (out) and "limen" (threshold).  Therefore, its original meaning was to "remove from the threshold" or "remove from consideration."  Over time, its meaning evolved to encompass the broader sense of removing or getting rid of something completely.
