The word "elegance" originates from the Old French word "elegance," which itself comes from the Latin word "elegantia."  "Elegans," the Latin adjective, means "choice," "refined," or "elegant."  The suffix "-ia" forms nouns of quality or state.  Therefore, the word's root suggests a careful selection and refinement leading to a pleasing aesthetic effect.
