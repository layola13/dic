The word "loenhoven" is not found in standard English dictionaries or etymology resources.  It's likely a proper noun (a name of a person, place, or thing), a misspelling, or a word from a very specialized or obscure field.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide the requested information, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (a book, article, website, conversation, etc.)
* **What is the surrounding text?** This would help determine the word's meaning and part of speech.


Without this context, I cannot provide the phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis.
