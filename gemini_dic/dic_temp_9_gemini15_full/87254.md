The word "heris" is not a recognized word in standard English.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, parts of speech, translation, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  There is no entry for "heris" in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a proper noun, or a word from a very specialized field.  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer a more informed response.
