词源:

The word is a combination of "grandmaster" and the suffix "-ly," which forms adverbs and adjectives.  "Grandmaster" itself originates from the title given to the highest-ranking chess players. The "grand" prefix emphasizes the high level of skill, while "master" denotes expertise.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the noun phrase into an adjective describing a quality or characteristic.
