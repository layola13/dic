词源:
From pharmacopoeia +‎ -ian.  Pharmacopoeia itself comes from Late Latin *pharmacopoea, from Greek φαρμακοποιία (pharmakopoía), from φάρμακον (phármakon, "drug") + ποιέω (poiéō, "I make").  Therefore, the word literally means "relating to the making of drugs" or "relating to an official book of drugs".
