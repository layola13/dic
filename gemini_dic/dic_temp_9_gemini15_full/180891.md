PHRASE->
There are no common set phrases using "rehumiliate" as it is a relatively uncommon word.  The word itself functions as a complete thought.


词源:
The word "rehumiliate" is formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") to the verb "humiliate."  "Humiliate" itself originates from the Latin word "humilis," meaning "lowly" or "humble."  The process of adding "ate" creates the verb form.
