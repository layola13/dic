overdominate: /ˌoʊvərˈdɑːmɪneɪt/ | v. | 超过优势；显性上位 | To exert excessive dominance or control over; to be superior in dominance to both homozygous genotypes.  Overdominance refers to a situation in genetics where a heterozygote has a higher fitness than either homozygote. This contrasts with complete dominance, where one allele masks the other completely, and incomplete dominance, where the heterozygote shows an intermediate phenotype. | Example: The hybrid offspring overdominated the parental lines in terms of yield.  杂交后代在产量方面超过了亲本系。


The allele for sickle cell anemia, for example, is harmful in homozygous form but provides a survival advantage in heterozygotes in malaria-prone regions. This is a classic example of overdominance. 例如，镰状细胞性贫血的等位基因在纯合状态下是有害的，但在疟疾多发地区，杂合子具有生存优势。这是一个典型的超显性例子。|近义词：dominate, outweigh, surpass | 反义词：underdominance, recessive
