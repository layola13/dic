miscorrelation:/ˌmɪskɒrəˈleɪʃən/| n. | 错相关，虚假相关 | The apparent relationship between two variables that is not actually causal.  It often arises from coincidence, a third confounding variable, or flawed methodology.  For example, a study might find a positive correlation between ice cream sales and drowning incidents, but this doesn't mean ice cream causes drowning; both are more likely correlated with hot weather. | Example: The study revealed a miscorrelation between the number of hours spent studying and exam scores; some students with fewer study hours actually performed better.  |近义词： spurious correlation, false correlation, illusory correlation | 反义词：true correlation, causal relationship | 名词
