词源:

The word "hallucination" comes from the Late Latin word *hallucinatio*, a combination of *hallucinari* ("to wander in mind," "to rave," "to be delirious") and the suffix *-atio* ("action of").  The root meaning points to a state of mental wandering or delirium, which is closely associated with the experience of hallucinations.
