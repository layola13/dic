self-fluxing: /ˈsɛlf ˈflʌksɪŋ/ | adj. | 自熔的，自焊的 | Self-fluxing refers to a material or process that produces its own flux during melting or welding.  A flux is a substance used to remove impurities and oxides from the surface of a metal, facilitating better joining or melting. A self-fluxing material contains components that act as a flux, eliminating the need for a separate fluxing agent. | Example:  The self-fluxing brazing alloy simplified the process significantly. 自熔的钎焊合金大大简化了工艺。  The self-fluxing filler metal ensured a clean weld. 自熔的填充金属确保了干净的焊缝。 | 近义词：self-brazing, autogenous | 反义词：requiring external flux


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The alloy self-fluxes at high temperatures. =这种合金在高温下自熔。
This process requires a self-fluxing material. =这个过程需要一种自熔材料。


一般过去时:
The brazing process self-fluxed well. =钎焊过程自熔良好。
The metal self-fluxed during the welding operation. =金属在焊接过程中自熔。


现在完成时:
The manufacturer has developed a new self-fluxing compound. =制造商已经开发出一种新型的自熔化合物。
The company has successfully implemented self-fluxing technology. =该公司已成功实施自熔技术。


过去完成时:
The weld had already self-fluxed before the additional flux was added. =在添加额外的助熔剂之前，焊缝已经自熔了。
They discovered that the material had self-fluxed imperfectly. =他们发现该材料的自熔不完全。


将来时:
The new alloy will self-flux more efficiently. =新型合金将更有效地自熔。
This technique will allow the material to self-flux at lower temperatures. =这种技术将允许材料在较低的温度下自熔。


虚拟语气:
If the material self-fluxed properly, the weld would be stronger. =如果材料自熔良好，焊缝就会更牢固。
I wish the filler metal had self-fluxed better. =我希望填充金属自熔得更好。


被动语态:
The process is facilitated by the self-fluxing nature of the alloy. =该过程得益于合金的自熔特性。
The weld was created using a self-fluxing filler metal. =焊缝是用自熔填充金属制造的。


疑问句:
Does this brazing alloy self-flux? =这种钎焊合金是否自熔？
Will the new material self-flux effectively? =新型材料是否能有效自熔？


否定句:
The older alloy did not self-flux adequately. =旧的合金自熔不足。
The process does not involve a separate self-fluxing agent. =该过程不涉及单独的自熔剂。
