词源:
The word "nationalistic" is derived from "nationalism," which in turn comes from "nation" + "-ism."  "Nation" originates from the Latin word "natio," meaning "birth," "race," or "people." The suffix "-ism" denotes a doctrine, system, or practice.  Therefore, "nationalism" literally means a belief system or practice centered around a nation or its people.  "Nationalistic" is the adjectival form, describing something related to or characterized by nationalism.
