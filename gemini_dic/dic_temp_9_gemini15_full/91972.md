/ˌhaɪpəˈmjuːtəbli/ | adj. |高度可变的；极易变异的 | Highly mutable; capable of undergoing frequent or significant changes.  The term suggests a level of mutability exceeding the typical.  It is not a standard dictionary word and appears to be a newly coined term, possibly in a specific scientific or technical context.  Therefore, providing examples, synonyms, and antonyms is difficult without more context. |  Example: "The hypermutably genome of the virus allowed it to rapidly adapt to new host environments." (This is a constructed example to illustrate potential usage.) |  近义词:  highly variable, extremely mutable, rapidly evolving (These are approximations and may not be perfect synonyms depending on the intended context.) | 反义词:  immutable, stable, unchanging, constant | 词性: adjective
