词源：The word "redoubtable" comes from the Old French word "redoutable," meaning "dreaded," "feared," or "to be feared."  It is derived from the verb "redouter," meaning "to fear" or "to dread," which in turn has roots in the Latin word "dubitare," meaning "to doubt" or "to hesitate."  The prefix "re-" intensified the meaning.
