The word "looing" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a regionalism, or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, clarification is needed:

* **Could you double-check the spelling?**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or related word?
* **Could you provide context?**  Where did you encounter this word? Knowing the sentence or situation in which it appeared would help determine its possible meaning.

Without this information, I cannot fulfill your request.
