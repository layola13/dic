词源:
The origin of this idiom is unclear, but it likely emerged in the 1800s.  The imagery suggests a decline into a state associated with dogs – unkempt, neglected, and possibly even morally questionable.  The dogs themselves are not necessarily portrayed negatively, but rather represent the state of disarray into which something has fallen.
