fuel-injected:/ˈfjuːəlɪnˈdʒektɪd/| adj.|燃油喷射的|Equipped with a fuel injection system.  Fuel injection is a method of delivering fuel to an internal combustion engine. It precisely meters and sprays fuel into the combustion chamber, resulting in better fuel efficiency, reduced emissions, and improved engine performance compared to older carburetor systems.|例句：My new car has a fuel-injected engine, which is much more efficient. 我的新车是燃油喷射发动机，效率高得多。
例句：The fuel-injected system ensures optimal combustion and reduces harmful emissions. 燃油喷射系统确保最佳燃烧并减少有害排放。|近义词：injection-equipped|反义词：carburetor

词源:
fuel (n.) + injected (v. past participle)  "fuel" 源自古法语"fuille"，意为"柴火",  "injected" 来自inject (v.)  inject 源自拉丁语"injectus"，意为"抛入，投入"。 因此 fuel-injected 字面意思为"燃料被注入的"，形容词性修饰被注入燃油的引擎或系统。
