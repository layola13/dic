reforfeitures:/ˌriːˈfɔːrfitʃərz/| n.|再没收；再次没收的财产|The term "reforfeitures" refers to the act of seizing something again that has already been forfeited, typically due to a breach of conditions or a subsequent offense.  It implies a double penalty or a renewed confiscation.|例句：The court ordered reforfeitures of the assets previously returned due to the defendant's continued illegal activities.  法院下令再次没收先前已返还的资产，因为被告继续从事非法活动。


The king, dissatisfied with the initial forfeiture, demanded reforfeitures of the land.|国王对最初的没收不满意，要求再次没收土地。|近义词：confiscation, seizure, repossession|反义词：restoration, restitution, return


由于reforfeitures是一个相对罕见的词，其词性，用法以及例句都基于其词根的含义进行推断。  其词源来自"re-" (again) + "forfeiture" (the act of losing or surrendering something as a penalty).  没有足够的语料库数据支持对reforfeitures的更详细的语法分析，例如一般现在时，过去时，等等。  因为此词在日常生活中极少用到，所以也没有常见的词组搭配。
