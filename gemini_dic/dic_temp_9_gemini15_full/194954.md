词源:
The word "semi-official" is a compound word.  "Semi-" is a prefix derived from Latin "semi-" meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."  "Official" comes from the Middle English "officiell," ultimately from Late Latin "officialis," meaning "of or pertaining to an office." Therefore, "semi-official" literally means "partly official."
