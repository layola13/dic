词源:

The word "reasonist" is a relatively modern coinage, formed by combining "reason" (from Old French *raisun, from Latin ratio, meaning "reckoning, calculation, reason") with the suffix "-ist" (indicating a person who follows a particular doctrine or practice).  The word reflects the rise of rationalism as a philosophical school of thought.
