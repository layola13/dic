siphonophoran:/ˌsaɪfənˈɒfərən/| n. |管水母纲动物|A siphonophoran is a marine hydrozoan belonging to the order Siphonophora.  They are colonial organisms, meaning they are composed of many specialized individual polyps and medusoids that work together as a single unit. These polyps and medusoids are genetically identical but have different forms and functions, such as feeding, reproduction, and defense.  Siphonophores exhibit a remarkable diversity of forms and sizes, ranging from small, inconspicuous creatures to enormous, complex colonies that can reach tens of meters in length.  Examples include the Portuguese man o' war (Physalia physalis) and various other species found in oceans worldwide.|The Portuguese man o' war is a well-known example of a siphonophoran.|近义词：hydrozoan (a broader term)|反义词：N/A
