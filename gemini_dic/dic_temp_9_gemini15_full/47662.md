词源:
The word "debrief" is a back-formation from "brief," meaning to give instructions. The prefix "de-" implies the reversal of the action, thus "debrief" means to obtain information after a task, rather than giving it before.  The word gained prominence during and after World War II, becoming widely used in military and intelligence contexts.
