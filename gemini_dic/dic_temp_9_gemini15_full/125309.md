multigraph:/ˈmʌltiɡræf/| n. |多重图|A multigraph is a graph that allows multiple edges (also called parallel edges) between any two given vertices, and loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself). Unlike a simple graph, which allows at most one edge between any two vertices and no loops, a multigraph permits multiple connections between the same pair of nodes.  This is useful in modeling situations where multiple relationships exist between entities. For instance, multiple roads connecting two cities or multiple flights between two airports. |Example:  A road map depicting multiple highways between two cities is a good representation of a multigraph.  This differs from a simple graph where only one road would be shown between the cities.|近义词: graph (in a broader sense)|反义词: simple graph


USAGE->

This word, being a noun, does not conjugate like verbs.  The usage is primarily in describing the nature of a graph in graph theory and related fields.  There are no tenses or voices to conjugate.

Example 1: "The transportation network was modeled as a multigraph to account for the numerous train lines between major cities." = 交通网络被建模为多重图，以解释主要城市之间众多的火车线路。

Example 2: "In this data structure, a multigraph is used to represent relationships between users in a social network where multiple connections between individuals are possible." = 在这个数据结构中，多重图用于表示社交网络中用户之间的关系，其中个体之间可以有多种连接。


PHRASE->

There are no common phrases specifically using "multigraph" as it's a technical term.  Phrases would be found within the context of graph theory, such as:

1. directed multigraph:  有向多重图
2. weighted multigraph: 加权多重图
3. planar multigraph: 平面多重图
4. connected multigraph: 连通多重图
5. complete multigraph: 完全多重图
