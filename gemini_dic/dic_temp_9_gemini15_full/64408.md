ergatives:/ˈɜːɡətɪvz/| n. |使役动词；施事宾语|Ergatives are verbs that take a subject which is the object of the action and an object that is the agent performing the action.  This is in contrast to transitive verbs where the subject performs the action on the object.  The term also refers to the languages that use such verbs and their associated grammatical structures.|Example: "The stone broke the window."  In this sentence, "the stone" is the subject, but it's the object of the action (breaking). The window is the object, but it is the thing being acted upon. This is an ergative construction.|近义词： causative verbs |反义词：transitive verbs|名词
