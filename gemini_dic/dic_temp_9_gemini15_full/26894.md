calabarine:/ˌkæləˈbæriːn/| n. |卡拉巴豆碱|A highly toxic alkaloid found in the Calabar bean (Physostigma venenosum). It is a potent cholinesterase inhibitor, meaning it blocks the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter.  This leads to an accumulation of acetylcholine, causing various neurological effects.  Calabarine is rarely encountered outside of research settings and has limited practical applications due to its toxicity.|The effects of calabarine on the nervous system are being studied in laboratories.|近义词：Physostigmine (similar effects, though not identical)|反义词：无
