dropstones:/ˈdrɒpˌstoʊnz/ | n. |冰碛石，冰落石 | Stones dropped into sediment by melting icebergs or glaciers.  These stones are often larger than the surrounding sediment and show signs of having been transported from a distant source.  They are important indicators of past glaciation. | Example: The presence of dropstones in the sedimentary layers provided strong evidence of past glacial activity.  冰碛石沉积层的存在有力地证明了过去的冰川活动。


The discovery of dropstones in deep-sea sediments helped scientists understand past ice ages. 深海沉积物中冰碛石的发现帮助科学家了解了过去的冰河时代。|近义词：glacial erratic, ice-rafted debris |反义词：N/A
