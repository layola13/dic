词源:
From Middle English *scurrilen, from Old French *escurriler ("to jest, make fun of"), from Medieval Latin scurrilis ("buffoonish, scurrilous"), from Latin scurra ("buffoon, jester").  The word ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *sker- ("to cut, shear"), suggesting an etymological connection to the idea of cutting or wounding with words.
