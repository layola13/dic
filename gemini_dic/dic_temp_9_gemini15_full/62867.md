词源:
The word "enkindle" comes from the Old English "oncyndan," which is a combination of "on-" (meaning "on" or "in") and "cyndan" (meaning "to kindle" or "to ignite").  The word "kindle" itself has roots in the Old High German "kinteln," meaning "to spark" or "to ignite".  Thus, "enkindle" literally means "to set on fire" or "to ignite completely".
