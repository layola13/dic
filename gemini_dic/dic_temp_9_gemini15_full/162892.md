词源:

The word "precensuring" is a combination of "pre-" (meaning "before") and "censuring" (the act of censoring).  The root "censor" originates from the Latin word "censor," which referred to one of two Roman magistrates responsible for conducting the census and also for overseeing public morals.  The meaning gradually evolved to include the suppression of objectionable material.
