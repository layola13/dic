diageotropism:/ˌdaɪədʒiˈoʊtrɒpɪzəm/| n. |负向地性，背地性|The growth of a plant organ in a direction opposite to that of gravity.  It is a type of gravitropism, where the plant grows away from gravity. For example, shoots typically exhibit diageotropism, growing upwards against the force of gravity.|Example: The stems of most plants show diageotropism, growing upwards towards the light.|近义词：negative gravitropism|反义词：geotropism, gravitropism


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Diageotropism ensures that shoots grow upwards. = 负向地性确保枝条向上生长。
Plants exhibit diageotropism in their growth. = 植物在其生长过程中表现出负向地性。


一般过去时:
The experiment demonstrated diageotropism in the seedlings. = 实验证明了幼苗的负向地性。
Researchers studied how diageotropism affected plant growth. = 研究人员研究了负向地性如何影响植物生长。


现在完成时:
Scientists have observed diageotropism in many plant species. = 科学家们已经在许多植物物种中观察到负向地性。
Studies have shown the role of auxin in diageotropism. = 研究表明生长素在负向地性中的作用。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had hypothesized about the mechanism of diageotropism. = 在实验之前，他们已经对负向地性的机制进行了假设。
The team had already confirmed the presence of diageotropism in the sample. = 该团队已经证实了样品中存在负向地性。


将来时:
Future research will explore the genetic basis of diageotropism. = 未来研究将探索负向地性的遗传基础。
We will investigate how environmental factors influence diageotropism. = 我们将研究环境因素如何影响负向地性。


虚拟语气:
If the plant lacked diageotropism, it would grow downwards. = 如果植物缺乏负向地性，它就会向下生长。
It is important that we understand the mechanisms of diageotropism. = 我们理解负向地性的机制很重要。


被动语态:
Diageotropism is influenced by various environmental factors. = 负向地性受各种环境因素的影响。
The experiment was designed to study diageotropism in detail. = 该实验旨在详细研究负向地性。


疑问句:
Does diageotropism play a crucial role in plant survival? = 负向地性在植物生存中起着至关重要的作用吗？
What are the key factors affecting diageotropism? = 影响负向地性的关键因素是什么？


否定句:
The roots do not exhibit diageotropism; they show positive gravitropism. = 根不表现负向地性；它们表现正向地性。
This particular plant species does not show a strong diageotropism. = 这种特定的植物物种没有表现出强烈的负向地性。


PHRASE->
diageotropism in plants = 植物的负向地性
mechanisms of diageotropism = 负向地性的机制
role of auxin in diageotropism = 生长素在负向地性中的作用
effects of gravity on diageotropism = 重力对负向地性的影响
studies on diageotropism = 关于负向地性的研究
