词源:

The word "peacockishly" is derived from "peacock" + "-ish" + "-ly".

"Peacock" refers to the large, brightly colored bird known for its extravagant plumage and display.  The suffix "-ish"  transforms a noun into an adjective, suggesting a resemblance or quality.  Finally, "-ly" changes the adjective into an adverb, indicating manner or way.  Therefore, "peacockishly" describes an action or manner that is similar to a peacock's showy behavior.


用法说明:

"Peacockishly" is an adverb used to describe actions or behavior that are ostentatious, showy, or flamboyant. It implies a deliberate attempt to attract attention or impress others, often with a sense of vanity or self-importance.  The word carries a slightly negative connotation, suggesting that the showiness is excessive or perhaps even tasteless.


例句:

近义词:

Showily
Ostentatiously
Flamboyantly

反义词:

注意：由于“peacockishly”本身就带有一定的负面色彩（指过分炫耀），所以与其直接的反义词并非完全意义上的“不炫耀”，而是指行为举止低调、不张扬。
