英文解析:The word "senselessnesses" is the plural form of "senselessness," which refers to actions, statements, or situations that lack sense, purpose, or meaning;  it implies a lack of reason or logic.  It often describes something foolish or absurd.


例句:

The report detailed the senselessnesses of the ongoing conflict.  报告详细阐述了持续冲突的荒谬之处。


词源:

* **sense:**  From Old French *sens*, from Latin *sensus*, "feeling, perception, meaning."  This root indicates a connection to perception and understanding.

* **-less:**  A suffix meaning "without" or "lacking."

* **-ness:** A suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.


Therefore, "senselessnesses" combines the idea of "lacking sense" (senseless) with the plural form to denote multiple instances of such lack of sense or meaning.
