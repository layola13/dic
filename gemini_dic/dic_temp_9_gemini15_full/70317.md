词源:
The word "fiefdom" originates from the Old French word "fief," meaning "fief," "fee," or "estate."  This, in turn, is derived from the Frankish word "fehu," meaning "cattle" or "property," ultimately reflecting the historical connection between land ownership and power in feudal societies.  The "-dom" suffix indicates a state or condition, creating the meaning of "territory controlled by a feudal lord."
