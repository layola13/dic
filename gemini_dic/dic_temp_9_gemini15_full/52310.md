词源:
The word "dicker" ultimately derives from the Middle Dutch word "dikken," meaning "to thicken" or "to make thick."  The semantic shift from "thickening" to "bargaining" is unclear, but it likely involved an intermediate meaning related to "packing tightly" or "compressing," perhaps referring to the close negotiation and haggling involved in a bargaining process. The modern meaning is largely established by the 16th century.
