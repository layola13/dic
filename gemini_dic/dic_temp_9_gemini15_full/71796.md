词源:
The word "fledged" comes from the Old English word *fleogan*, meaning "to fly."  The past participle *flogen* became "flown," and the adjective "fledged" developed as a separate form referring to birds with fully developed feathers and the ability to fly.  The metaphorical extension to describe experience and maturity followed naturally.
