preworshipping: /ˌpriːˈwɜːʃɪpɪŋ/ | adj. | 预先崇拜；提前敬拜 |  This word is not found in standard English dictionaries. It appears to be a newly coined word, combining "pre-" (before) and "worshipping" (the act of worshipping). It implies the act of worshipping something or someone *before* a formal or scheduled worship event, or perhaps a habitual act of worship before other activities begin.  There is no established meaning or usage.  Therefore, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage is impossible as the word lacks common acceptance and definition.
