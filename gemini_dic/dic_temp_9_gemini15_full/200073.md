skeuomorph:/ˈskjuːəmɔːrf/| n. |拟物设计，仿物设计 |A design element that mimics the appearance of a physical object in a digital interface.  It's a design choice where digital interfaces borrow visual cues from their real-world counterparts. For example, the use of a notebook icon to represent a notes app or a trash can icon to represent a delete function. |Example: The app's skeuomorphic design included realistic-looking buttons and textures.  这个应用程序的拟物化设计包括逼真的按钮和纹理。|近义词：imitation, simulation, analogy |反义词：flat design, minimalist design


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The app uses many skeuomorphs. = 这个应用程序使用了许多拟物设计。
This design employs a skeuomorphic approach. = 此设计采用拟物化方法。


一般过去时:
Early interfaces often used skeuomorphs. = 早期的界面经常使用拟物设计。
The designer implemented several skeuomorphs. = 设计师实现了几种拟物设计。


现在完成时:
Designers have increasingly moved away from skeuomorphs. = 设计师们越来越远离拟物设计。
Many apps have incorporated skeuomorphic elements. = 许多应用程序都包含了拟物化元素。


过去完成时:
Before flat design became popular, skeuomorphs were common. = 在扁平化设计流行之前，拟物设计很常见。
They had already abandoned skeuomorphic design principles. = 他们已经放弃了拟物化设计原则。


将来时:
The future of design may see fewer skeuomorphs. = 未来设计可能会看到更少的拟物设计。
We will likely see less use of skeuomorphs in new interfaces. = 我们可能会在新的界面中看到更少的拟物设计。


虚拟语气:
If the design were more skeuomorphic, it would feel more familiar. = 如果设计更具拟物化，它会感觉更熟悉。
I wish the interface had more skeuomorphic features. = 我希望界面有更多拟物化功能。


被动语态:
Skeuomorphs were heavily criticized in the past. = 拟物设计过去受到强烈批评。
Several skeuomorphic elements are being removed from the update. = 更新中正在删除几个拟物化元素。


疑问句:
Are skeuomorphs still relevant in modern design? = 拟物设计在现代设计中仍然相关吗？
Does this app utilize any skeuomorphs? = 这个应用程序是否使用了任何拟物设计？


否定句:
The new interface doesn't use any skeuomorphs. = 新界面没有使用任何拟物设计。
This design philosophy avoids skeuomorphs entirely. = 这种设计理念完全避免了拟物设计。


PHRASE->

skeuomorphic design = 拟物化设计
skeuomorphic element = 拟物化元素
skeuomorphic interface = 拟物化界面
adopting skeuomorphism = 采用拟物设计
rejecting skeuomorphism = 摒弃拟物设计
