词源:

The word "shingler" is derived from the word "shingle," which itself has a complex etymology.  "Shingle" ultimately comes from the Old English word "scindel," referring to a thin piece of wood.  The "-er" suffix is a common agentive suffix in English, indicating a person who performs a specific action (e.g., baker, painter).  Therefore, "shingler" literally means a person who works with shingles.
