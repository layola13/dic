Word Origin:

The word "overmystification" is a modern coinage, formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively"), the noun "mystification" (the act of making something mysterious or confusing), and the suffix "-ation" (forming nouns of action or process).  "Mystification" itself derives from "mystery" and ultimately from the Greek word "mystes" (initiated into religious mysteries).
