词源:  The word "low-down" originates from the combination of "low" and "down".  "Low" indicates a lower level or status, while "down" implies a complete or thorough understanding. The phrase evolved over time, its meaning shifting from simply meaning "low" or "down" to the more nuanced meaning of "essential facts" or "inside information".  The usage as "of low quality" is a later development, stemming from the implication of low status.
