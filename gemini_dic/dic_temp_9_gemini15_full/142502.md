osmotic:/ɒzˈmɒtɪk/| adj.|渗透的；渗透压的|Relating to or involving osmosis.  Osmosis is the movement of a solvent (usually water) across a semipermeable membrane from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration.|Example: The plant cells absorbed water through osmotic pressure.  植物细胞通过渗透压吸收水分。|近义词：permeable, diffusive|反义词：impermeable


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The osmotic pressure is high. = 渗透压很高。
Osmosis affects plant growth. = 渗透作用影响植物生长。


一般过去时:
The solution showed osmotic effects. = 溶液显示出渗透效应。
We studied osmotic pressure in class. = 我们在课堂上学习了渗透压。


现在完成时:
Scientists have observed many osmotic phenomena. = 科学家们已经观察到许多渗透现象。
The experiment has demonstrated osmotic movement. = 实验已经证明了渗透运动。


过去完成时:
They had already calculated the osmotic potential. = 他们已经计算出渗透势。
The researchers had observed osmotic changes. = 研究人员已经观察到渗透变化。


将来时:
We will measure the osmotic pressure tomorrow. = 我们明天将测量渗透压。
The experiment will demonstrate osmotic diffusion. = 实验将演示渗透扩散。


虚拟语气:
If the membrane were permeable, osmosis would occur. = 如果膜是可渗透的，就会发生渗透作用。
If the concentration were equal, there would be no osmotic pressure. = 如果浓度相等，就不会有渗透压。


被动语态:
Osmotic pressure is affected by temperature. = 渗透压受温度影响。
The experiment was designed to measure osmotic flow. = 实验旨在测量渗透流。


疑问句:
Is osmosis a passive or active process? = 渗透作用是主动还是被动过程？
What factors affect osmotic potential? = 哪些因素会影响渗透势？


否定句:
The solution did not show significant osmotic effects. = 该溶液未显示明显的渗透效应。
There was no osmotic pressure difference across the membrane. = 膜两侧没有渗透压差。


PHRASE->
osmotic pressure: 渗透压
osmotic potential: 渗透势
osmotic shock: 渗透休克
osmotic balance: 渗透平衡
osmotic dehydration: 渗透脱水
