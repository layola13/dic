词源:

The phrase "run-of-the-mill" originates from the milling process in a flour mill.  The "run" refers to a batch or a continuous flow of grain being processed.  "Of the mill" indicates that the product is simply the standard output of the mill—nothing special or unique.  Thus, "run-of-the-mill" originally described grain or flour of average quality, and later expanded to describe anything ordinary or commonplace.
