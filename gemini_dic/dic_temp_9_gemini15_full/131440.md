noncoalescence: /ˌnɒnˌkoʊəˈlɛsəns/ | n. | 非聚结，不合并 | The failure of separate parts or substances to merge or combine into a single mass.  This term often arises in contexts where one might expect merging or fusion, but it doesn't occur.  For instance, in materials science, it might describe the lack of fusion between particles during a manufacturing process. In meteorology, it could refer to the non-combination of cloud droplets into larger raindrops. | Example: The noncoalescence of the oil and water phases resulted in a two-layer emulsion.  = 油水分相的不合并导致了双层乳液。

The noncoalescence of the cloud droplets prevented the formation of significant rainfall. = 云滴的不合并阻止了大量降雨的形成。 | 近义词：non-fusion, non-union, separation | 反义词：coalescence, fusion, merging, unification
