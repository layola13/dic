Glutinative languages often have many prefixes and suffixes attached to a root word. |例句：The glutinative nature of the language makes it challenging for learners.  这种语言的粘着性使得学习者难以掌握。|例句：This glue has a highly glutinative quality, making it ideal for strong bonds.  这种胶水具有很强的粘性，非常适合粘接牢固。|近义词：adhesive, sticky, viscous, agglutinative |反义词：non-adhesive, loose


词源:  From Latin *glūtinātivus, from glūtināre "to glue," from glūs "glue."

用法说明:

The adjective "glutinative" has two main uses:

1.  **In chemistry and materials science**: It describes substances that are sticky or adhesive, able to bind or hold things together.  This is the more common and straightforward meaning.

2.  **In linguistics**: This is a more specialized usage.  It refers to a type of language structure where grammatical relations are expressed primarily by adding affixes (prefixes and suffixes) to root words without significant internal changes to the morphemes themselves.  These languages are often contrasted with inflectional languages, where word endings change significantly to indicate grammatical function.  Many agglutinative languages (a term often used interchangeably with glutinative in this context) exist, particularly in Eurasia and the Americas.  Note that the term "agglutinative" is generally preferred by linguists.


The word is rarely used in everyday conversation except in the context of describing sticky substances.  The linguistic meaning is primarily found in academic discussions of morphology and typology.
