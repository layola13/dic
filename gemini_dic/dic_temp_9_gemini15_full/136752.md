近义词：briefly, concisely, succinctly, tersely

反义词：expressively, elaborately, verbosely, sententiously


词源：The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "sententiously," which itself derives from the Latin word "sententia" meaning "sentence, opinion, maxim."  Therefore, "nonsententiously" means "not in a sententious manner."  Sententious implies expressing opinions in a pompous or moralistic way, often with concise and aphoristic statements.  The "non-" prefix negates this characteristic.
