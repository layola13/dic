sagittocyst:/ˌsædʒɪˈtoʊsɪst/| n. |箭囊；箭囊虫|A sagittocyst is a type of cnidocyst (stinging cell) found in some cnidarians, particularly in the order Sagartiidae (sea anemones).  It is characterized by a long, thin, barbed thread that is discharged to entangle prey. Unlike other cnidocysts, its primary function isn't to inject venom, but rather to ensnare small organisms. |Example: The sea anemone used its sagittocysts to capture a small crustacean.  海葵用它的箭囊捕获了一只小型甲壳类动物。|近义词: cnidocyst (general term)|反义词: N/A|名词

USAGE->
This word is highly specialized and doesn't lend itself to the grammatical examples requested for a common word like "what."  It's primarily used in scientific contexts describing the biology of sea anemones and related organisms.  There are no common verb conjugations, tenses, or phrases associated with it.  The grammatical usage would follow standard noun usage rules in English.

Example 1 (Simple Sentence):  The researcher identified several sagittocysts in the sea anemone sample. 研究人员在海葵样本中鉴定出几个箭囊。

Example 2 (Complex Sentence):  Because sagittocysts primarily function in prey capture, their morphology is closely tied to the size and type of prey the anemone typically consumes. 因为箭囊主要用于捕获猎物，所以它们的形态与海葵通常食用的猎物的大小和类型密切相关。
