noctambulo:/nɒkˈtæmbjʊləʊ/ | n. |梦游者，夜游症患者 | A person who walks in their sleep; a somnambulist.  | Example:  The noctambulo wandered through the house, completely unaware of his surroundings.  梦游者在屋里四处游荡，完全没有意识到周围的环境。 |近义词：somnambulist, sleepwalker | 反义词：N/A


词源:

The word "noctambulo" is derived from Latin.  "Nox," "noctis" (genitive) means "night," and "ambulare" means "to walk." Therefore, "noctambulo" literally translates to "night walker."


用法说明:

Noctambulo is primarily used as a noun.  It's less common than "sleepwalker" or "somnambulist" in modern English, but it retains a slightly more formal or literary tone.  It's not typically used in everyday conversation.  There is no verb form associated directly with this noun.  The verb form would be a descriptive phrase (e.g., "to noctambulate").


例句:

*  The doctor diagnosed the child as a noctambulo after observing his nighttime wanderings.  医生在观察到孩子的夜间游荡后，诊断他为梦游症患者。

* He was a known noctambulo, often found asleep in unexpected places around the house. 他是出了名的梦游者，经常在房子里意想不到的地方睡着。


由于noctambulo本身不具备动词形式，也无法直接进行时态变化，因此以下的时态变化部分将以“sleepwalking”为例，它可以用来描述梦游的动作。
