preconformities:/ˌpriːkənˈfɔːrmətiz/| n. |预先一致性，预先顺从|  The term "preconformities" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism, likely formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before or in advance) and "conformities" (instances of conformity).  It would refer to instances of conformity that occur before a specific event or process.  The precise meaning depends heavily on the context in which it's used.  To understand its meaning, one would need to examine the surrounding text. For example, it might refer to  pre-existing societal norms that influence later behavior, or to individuals conforming to expectations before any external pressure is applied. |例句：The study investigated preconformities in attitudes toward immigration before the recent political campaigns began. (这项研究调查了在最近的政治运动开始之前，人们对移民的态度预先一致性。)  There were clear preconformities in the students' responses to the survey before the teacher's instructions were given. (在老师给出指示之前，学生对调查问卷的回答就存在明显的一致性。) |近义词:|preexisting conformity, prior agreement, antecedent compliance|反义词:|nonconformity, divergence, dissent|名词
