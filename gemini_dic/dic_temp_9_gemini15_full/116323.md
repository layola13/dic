词源:
The word "masterfulnesses" is derived from "masterful" + "-ness" (suffix indicating a quality or state) + "-es" (plural suffix).  "Masterful" itself comes from "master" (a person skilled in a craft or art) + "-ful" (suffix indicating full of or characterized by).  Therefore, the word traces its origin back to the Old French "maistre" and ultimately to the Latin "magister," meaning "teacher" or "master."
