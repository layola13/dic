The word "scun" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a slang term with a very limited usage, or a word from a specific dialect or jargon.  To provide an analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (e.g., a book, a conversation, a website)
* **What was the surrounding text or conversation?**  This would help to understand the intended meaning.

Without this information, I cannot provide the requested phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc.
