deliquation:/ˌdɛlɪˈkweɪʃən/| n. |熔融；液化；(金属的)半熔融|The process of melting or becoming liquid, especially of a solid substance by the action of heat or moisture.  This term is often used in chemistry and metallurgy to describe the partial melting of a solid, typically a metal or salt. |Example: The deliquation of the salt caused it to become a viscous liquid.  盐的液化使其变成粘稠液体。|近义词：liquefaction, fusion, melting |反义词：solidification, freezing


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The salt undergoes deliquation in humid conditions. = 盐在潮湿条件下会发生液化。
This process involves the deliquation of several minerals. = 这个过程涉及几种矿物的液化。

一般过去时:
The deliquation of the metal occurred at a relatively low temperature. = 金属的液化发生在相对较低的温度下。
The chemist observed the deliquation of the compound. = 化学家观察了化合物的液化。

现在完成时:
The deliquation has significantly altered the material's properties. = 液化已显著改变了材料的特性。
Scientists have studied the deliquation of various substances for centuries. = 科学家们几个世纪以来一直在研究各种物质的液化。

过去完成时:
Before the reaction began, the deliquation had already started. = 在反应开始之前，液化就已经开始了。
The experiment showed that the deliquation had been completed within an hour. = 实验表明，液化在一小时内就完成了。

将来时:
The material will undergo deliquation if exposed to moisture. = 如果接触到水分，这种材料将会液化。
We predict that the deliquation will be completed by tomorrow. = 我们预测液化将在明天完成。

虚拟语气:
If the temperature were higher, the deliquation would occur more quickly. = 如果温度更高，液化会更快发生。
I wish the deliquation process were more efficient. = 我希望液化过程更有效率。

被动语态:
The sample was subjected to deliquation analysis. = 样品经过了液化分析。
The deliquation process is often controlled by adjusting the temperature. = 液化过程通常通过调节温度来控制。

疑问句:
Does deliquation affect the purity of the substance? = 液化会影响物质的纯度吗？
What factors influence the rate of deliquation? = 哪些因素会影响液化的速率？

否定句:
The substance did not undergo deliquation under normal conditions. = 在正常条件下，该物质不会发生液化。
The experiment failed to produce any observable deliquation. = 实验未能产生任何可观察到的液化现象。
