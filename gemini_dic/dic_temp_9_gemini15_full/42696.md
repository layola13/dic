词源:

The word "counterterrorist" is a compound word formed from "counter-" (meaning "against" or "opposite") and "terrorist."  "Terrorist" originates from the French word "terroriste" (1790s), ultimately deriving from the Latin "terror," meaning "fear" or "dread."  Thus, "counterterrorist" literally means "against terrorism" or "opposing terrorists."
