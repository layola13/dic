gymnocarpous:/ˌdʒɪmˈnɔːkəpəs/| adj.| 裸果的 | Having fruits with the seeds exposed, not enclosed in a pericarp.  The term refers to plants whose fruits lack a true, developed fruit wall (pericarp). This often results in the seeds being directly exposed or only partially covered. |Example: Many gymnosperms, such as conifers, are gymnocarpous, as their seeds are borne on scales or cones without a fleshy covering.  许多裸子植物，如针叶树，都是裸果的，因为它们的种子长在鳞片或球果上，没有肉质覆盖物。|近义词：exocarpous (less common)|反义词：angiospermous
