词源：
The word "overambition" is a combination of "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessive") and "ambition."  "Ambition" comes from the Old French word "ambicion," ultimately derived from the Latin "ambitio," meaning "going around," "a canvassing for votes," and later, "desire for honor or power."  Therefore, "overambition" literally signifies an excessive desire for honor, power, or achievement.
