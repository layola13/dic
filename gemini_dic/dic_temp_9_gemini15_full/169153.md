prolate:/ˈproʊleɪt/| adj.|长球形的，长椭圆形的|Longer than it is wide; elongated.  A prolate spheroid is an ellipsoid of revolution obtained by rotating an ellipse about its major axis. |例句：The Earth is not a perfect sphere; it is a slightly prolate spheroid.  地球并非完美的球体；它是一个略微长球形的球体。

The nucleus of a comet is often described as prolate. 彗星的核通常被描述为长球形的。|近义词：elongated, oblong, extended|反义词：oblate, compressed
