词源:

The word "semidangerousness" is a combination of:

* **semi-**:  A prefix meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."  It derives from Latin *semi*.

* **dangerous**: An adjective meaning "involving or causing danger."  It derives from Old French *dangereux*, ultimately from Latin *damnāre* ("to condemn").

* **-ness**: A suffix forming nouns of state, quality, or condition.  It is of Germanic origin.


Therefore, "semidangerousness" literally means the state or quality of being partly or somewhat dangerous.  It implies a level of risk that is less than full-blown danger, but still present and deserving of consideration.
