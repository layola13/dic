词源:  Derived from the name Pindar (Πίνδαρος), a Greek lyric poet (c. 518 – c. 438 BC) known for his complex and irregular odes celebrating athletic victories and other heroic themes.  His style was characterized by its abrupt transitions, shifts in tone, and dramatic intensity.  The term "Pindarical" thus came to describe poetry that emulates these qualities.
