PHRASE->

There are no common phrases specifically using "overmultitude". The word itself is relatively rare and is used as a single noun.  Phrases would typically be built around the concept of "overabundance" or "excess," rather than the word itself.  For example:

an overmultitude of problems =  很多问题
an overmultitude of reasons =  很多理由
dealing with an overmultitude = 处理过多的...

amidst an overmultitude of options = 在大量的选择中


词源:

The word "overmultitude" is a relatively modern formation. It combines the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much") with the noun "multitude" (meaning "a large number").  "Multitude" itself derives from the Latin word "multitudo," which is a combination of "multus" (much, many) and the suffix "-tudo" (state or condition of being).  Therefore, the word's root lies in the Latin concept of "the state of being numerous".
