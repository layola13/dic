词源:

The word "checkered" itself comes from the Old French word "eschequier," meaning "chessboard," referring to the pattern of alternating squares.  The suffix "-est" forms the superlative adjective, indicating the highest degree of the quality.  Therefore, "checkeredest" implies the most varied or the most characterized by a pattern of change.
