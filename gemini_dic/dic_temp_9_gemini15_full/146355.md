overfit:/ˈoʊvərˌfɪt/ | v. | 过拟合 | To create a statistical model that is too complex for the data it is trained on, resulting in poor generalization to new, unseen data.  The model learns the training data too well, including its noise and outliers, leading to inaccurate predictions on new data. |  The model overfit the training data, resulting in poor performance on the test set.  这个模型对训练数据进行了过拟合，导致测试集上的性能很差。| underfit |  generalize well | v.
