词源:  The word "huffish" comes from the noun "huff," meaning a fit of anger or sulkiness.  This in turn has origins in the Old English word "hofian," meaning "to swell" or "to puff up," suggesting the visual image of someone puffed up with anger.  The "-ish" suffix adds a qualitative sense, making it an adjective describing someone exhibiting these characteristics.
