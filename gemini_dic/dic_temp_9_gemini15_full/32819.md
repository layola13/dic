词源:
The word "chokecherry" is a compound word.  "Choke" refers to the astringent quality of the uncooked fruit, which can cause a slight choking sensation.  "Cherry" refers to its resemblance to cherries in appearance and growth habit.  The word's origin is thus descriptive of the plant's characteristics.
