The word "geal" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Providing context (where you encountered this word) would be helpful.

2. **A dialect word or archaic term:** It might be a regional dialect word or a word that was used in the past but is no longer common.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **A newly coined word or proper noun:**  It's possible it's a very recent invention, a proper noun (like a name or place), or a word specific to a particular field.

To help me provide the analysis you're looking for, please clarify where you found the word "geal" and what its context is.
