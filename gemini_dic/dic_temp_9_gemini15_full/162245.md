词源:

The word "pre-tax" is a compound word.  "Pre-" is a prefix meaning "before" or "prior to," derived from Latin "prae," meaning "before" or "in front of." "Tax" comes from Old French "taxe," ultimately from Latin "taxare," meaning "to estimate, assess, or charge."  Therefore, "pre-tax" literally means "before tax."


用法说明:

"Pre-tax" is primarily used as an adjective to modify nouns representing financial figures, such as income, profit, earnings, or costs.  It clarifies that the stated amount does not yet include the deduction of taxes.  It is commonly used in financial statements, pay slips, and general discussions of income and expenses.
