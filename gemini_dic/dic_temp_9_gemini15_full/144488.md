词源:  The word "outthunder" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent than") and the verb "thunder" (meaning to make a loud rumbling sound).  It's a relatively rare word, formed through the productive process of adding prefixes to existing verbs to create new verbs with intensified meanings.
