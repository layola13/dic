semiliberalisms: /ˌsɛmiˈlɪbərəlɪzəm/ | n. | 半自由主义；温和自由主义 |  Semiliberalisms refer to political ideologies or approaches that incorporate some but not all aspects of liberalism. They often represent a compromise or a moderate position between full-fledged liberalism and more conservative or authoritarian viewpoints.  These ideologies might embrace liberal principles like individual rights and freedoms to a certain extent, but may also incorporate elements of social conservatism, economic interventionism, or other non-liberal ideas.  The specific blend of liberal and non-liberal elements varies greatly depending on the context and the specific semiliberal ideology in question. |  Example:  Some argue that the policies of certain European countries represent a form of semiliberalism, balancing individual liberties with significant social welfare programs and state intervention in the economy.  | 近义词：moderate liberalism, centrist politics | 反义词：radical liberalism, authoritarianism, conservatism | 名词
