词源:
The word "payday" is a compound word formed from "pay" and "day."  "Pay," meaning to give money in exchange for goods or services, has Old English and Old Norse roots.  "Day," signifying a period of 24 hours, also has Old English origins.  The combination arose naturally to describe the day on which payment is received.
