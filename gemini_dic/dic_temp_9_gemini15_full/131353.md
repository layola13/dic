词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adverb "chivalrously," which itself derives from "chivalry."  Chivalry, in turn, originates from the Old French word "chevalerie," meaning "knighthood" or "horsemanship," ultimately stemming from the Latin "caballarius" (horseman).  Thus, "nonchivalrously" signifies a lack of the qualities associated with knighthood, such as courtesy, honor, and gallantry.
