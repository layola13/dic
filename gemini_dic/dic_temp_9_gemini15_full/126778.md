nanometer:/ˈnænəˌmiːtər/ | n. |纳米 |A nanometer (nm) is a unit of length in the metric system, equal to one billionth of a meter (10⁻⁹ m). It's commonly used to measure extremely small things, such as the wavelength of light or the size of atoms and molecules.  | The diameter of a DNA molecule is about 2 nanometers.  DNA分子的直径约为2纳米。|micrometer, angstrom|kilometer|
