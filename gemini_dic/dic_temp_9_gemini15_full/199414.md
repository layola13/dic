词源:
The word "simplistic" is derived from the word "simple,"  meaning "not complex or complicated." The suffix "-istic" is added to form an adjective describing something characterized by simplicity, often to a fault.  The word evolved in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to emphasize the negative connotation of excessive simplification.
