The word "outblesses" does not exist in standard English.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information following the requested format.  It may be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or fictional context.  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer some assistance.
