mountless: /ˈmaʊntləs/ | adj. | 无数的，大量的 |  The word "mountless" is not a standard English word.  It's a rare or archaic formation, possibly a blend or playful invention combining the idea of "mountains" with the concept of being countless.  There's no established definition or usage in standard dictionaries.  It would likely be understood contextually as meaning "immense," "countless," or "uncountable," implying a vast quantity, like a number of things comparable to mountains.  Its use would be highly unusual and should be avoided in formal writing.  |  例句： (Hypothetical, as this word is not standard) The mountless stars filled the night sky.  (无数的星星布满了夜空。) | 近义词: countless, innumerable, immense, vast | 反义词: few, limited, scarce, countable
