词源:
The word "fashionista" is a relatively recent addition to the English language. It's a blend of "fashion" and the Italian suffix "-ista," which is used to form nouns indicating a person associated with a particular activity or profession (similar to the English suffix "-ist").  The "-ista" suffix gives the word a sense of expertise and passion.  Therefore, a fashionista is not just someone who likes fashion, but someone who actively engages with it and possesses a certain level of knowledge and style.
