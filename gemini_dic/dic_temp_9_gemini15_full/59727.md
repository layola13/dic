一般过去时:
Geologists discovered a large eclogite deposit. = 地质学家发现了一个大型榴辉岩矿床。
They studied the formation of the eclogite. = 他们研究了榴辉岩的形成。


现在完成时:
Scientists have analyzed many eclogite samples. = 科学家们已经分析了许多榴辉岩样本。
Research has shown that eclogite forms at great depths. = 研究表明，榴辉岩形成于很深的地方。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, they had prepared the eclogite sample. = 在分析之前，他们已经准备好了榴辉岩样本。
Geologists had already identified this rock as eclogite. = 地质学家们已经鉴定出这种岩石为榴辉岩。


将来时:
Researchers will study the eclogite's mineral composition. = 研究人员将研究榴辉岩的矿物成分。
They will publish their findings on the eclogite. = 他们将发表关于榴辉岩的研究结果。


虚拟语气:
If this rock were eclogite, it would contain omphacite. = 如果这块岩石是榴辉岩，它将含有钠闪石。

疑问句:
Is this rock an eclogite? = 这块岩石是榴辉岩吗？
What are the key minerals in this eclogite? = 这块榴辉岩的主要矿物是什么？


否定句:
This rock is not eclogite; it's basalt. = 这块岩石不是榴辉岩；它是玄武岩。
The sample did not show any signs of eclogite formation. = 样本没有显示任何榴辉岩形成的迹象。


PHRASE->
