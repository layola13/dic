词源:
The word "combine" comes from the Old French word "combiner," which ultimately derives from the Late Latin word "combinare," meaning "to join together" or "to link."  This in turn is related to the Latin word "com-", meaning "together," and "bini," meaning "two by two" or "in pairs," suggesting an original sense of joining things in pairs.
