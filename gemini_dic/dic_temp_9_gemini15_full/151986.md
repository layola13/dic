词源:  The word "pasturer" is derived from the word "pasture," meaning land used for grazing livestock.  The suffix "-er" is an agent suffix, indicating someone who performs the action.  Ultimately, "pasture" traces back to Old French *pasture and Latin *pastura,  meaning "feeding," related to "pastor" (shepherd).
