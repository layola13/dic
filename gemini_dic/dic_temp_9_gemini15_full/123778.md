词源:
The word "moot" comes from the Old English word "mōt," meaning "meeting" or "assembly."  In medieval England, a "moot" was a court or assembly where legal matters were discussed and debated. Over time, the word's meaning shifted to refer to the act of debating or discussing a topic, and then to the topic itself, often one that is uncertain or debatable.
