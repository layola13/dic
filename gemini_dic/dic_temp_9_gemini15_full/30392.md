词源:  The word "centilitres" is derived from the metric system.  "Centi-" is a prefix meaning "one hundredth," derived from the Latin word "centum" (hundred). "Litre" (or "liter" in American English) comes from the Greek word "litra," meaning "pound" (originally a unit of weight, later adapted for volume).  Therefore, a centilitre is literally "one hundredth of a litre."
