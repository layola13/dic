self-precipitation:/ˌsɛlfˌprɪˌsɪpɪˈteɪʃən/| n.|自沉淀，自行沉降|The process by which a substance separates from a solution or suspension and settles to the bottom without external intervention.  This often refers to chemical or physical processes. |Example: The self-precipitation of the impurities resulted in a clearer solution. 自身沉淀的杂质导致溶液更清澈。

The self-precipitation of the colloidal particles led to a significant increase in the viscosity of the mixture. 胶体粒子的自沉淀导致混合物的粘度显著增加。|近义词：sedimentation, settling|反义词：suspension, dispersion|名词

词源:
The word "self-precipitation" is a compound word.  "Self-" is a prefix meaning "by oneself" or "of oneself," and "precipitation" comes from the Latin "praecipitatio," meaning "a headlong fall" or "a throwing down."  In the chemical context, it refers to the process of a substance separating from a solution and settling.
