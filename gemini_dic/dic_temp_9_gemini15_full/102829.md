反义词：pleasantly, soothingly, harmoniously


词源:  Derived from the verb "jar," meaning to shake or vibrate violently, or to clash harshly. The "-ingly" suffix transforms the verb into an adverb, modifying the manner of an action or state.  The original sense of "jar" relates to a physical shaking, but the metaphorical extension to a harsh or discordant sound or effect is now the more common usage.
