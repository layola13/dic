ETYMOLOGY->
The word "mercilessness" is derived from the adjective "merciless," which itself comes from the Old French word "merci," meaning "mercy," with the addition of the negative prefix "in-" (or its modern form "-less").  The "-ness" suffix is a common English suffix that transforms adjectives into nouns, indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, "mercilessness" literally means the state of being without mercy.
