词源:
The word "calculus" comes from the Late Latin word *calculus*, meaning "small stone," "pebble," or "counter."  This is because ancient mathematicians used pebbles to perform calculations.  The mathematical meaning evolved through the use of the word in Medieval Latin to describe methods of calculation, eventually leading to its modern meaning of "calculus."
