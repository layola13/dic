词源:
The word "councillorship" is derived from "council" + "-ship".  "Council" comes from the Old French "conseil," meaning "advice, counsel," ultimately from the Latin "consilium" with the same meaning. The suffix "-ship" denotes status, rank, or skill. Therefore, "councillorship" literally means "the state or position of being a member of a council."
