词源：
The word "micromanage" is a blend of "micro" (meaning very small) and "manage." It emerged in the latter half of the 20th century, reflecting the increasing complexity and detail-orientation of modern management practices.  The prefix "micro" highlights the excessive focus on minute details, often at the expense of broader strategic goals.
