nonadiabatic: /ˌnɒnˌædiəˈbætɪk/ | adj. | 非绝热的 | Not occurring at constant heat content; involving a change in heat content.  Describes a process where the system is not in thermal equilibrium with its surroundings, allowing for heat exchange. In chemistry and physics, it often refers to processes where electronic transitions occur during a change in nuclear configuration, violating the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. |The reaction proceeded nonadiabatically, resulting in significant heat transfer to the environment.  非绝热反应导致大量的热量传递到环境中。| adiabatic | isothermal |
