词源:

The word "impressionableness" derives from the adjective "impressionable," which is formed from the verb "impress" + "-able."  "Impress" ultimately comes from the Old French "empresser," meaning "to press upon," from the Latin "im-," meaning "in" or "upon," and "premere," meaning "to press."  The suffix "-able" indicates capacity or capability. Therefore, "impressionableness" signifies the capacity or state of being easily impressed or influenced.
