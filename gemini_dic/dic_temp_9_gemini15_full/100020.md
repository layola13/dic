词源:
The word "interpermeate" combines the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") with "permeate" (meaning "to spread throughout").  "Permeate" itself originates from the Latin word "permeare," meaning "to go through," from "per-" (through) + "meare" (to go).  Therefore, "interpermeate" literally means "to go through between" or "to spread mutually throughout."
