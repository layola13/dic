词源:
The word "living-room" is a compound word formed from "living," meaning "alive" or "being lived in," and "room," meaning "a space within a building."  The term evolved to describe the main room of a house, where family life and social activities take place, as opposed to bedrooms or other more specialized spaces.  It is a relatively modern term, its usage becoming widespread in the 20th century.
