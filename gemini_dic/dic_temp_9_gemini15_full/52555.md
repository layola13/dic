diffraction:/dɪˈfrækʃən/ | n. |衍射，绕射 |The spreading out of waves as they pass through an aperture or around an obstacle.  This phenomenon occurs with all types of waves, including light, sound, and water waves.  The amount of diffraction depends on the wavelength of the wave and the size of the obstacle or aperture. | Example: The diffraction of light through a narrow slit creates an interference pattern.  光通过狭缝的衍射会产生干涉图样。|近义词：bending, scattering |反义词：reflection (in some contexts)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Diffraction explains the bending of light around corners. = 衍射解释了光绕过拐角的弯曲。
Light diffraction is studied in physics. = 物理学中研究光的衍射。


一般过去时:
Scientists observed the diffraction of X-rays. = 科学家们观察了X射线的衍射。
The experiment demonstrated light diffraction. = 实验演示了光的衍射。


现在完成时:
Researchers have studied diffraction patterns for centuries. = 研究人员已经研究了几个世纪的衍射图样。
We have observed significant diffraction effects. = 我们已经观察到显著的衍射效应。


过去完成时:
They had already completed the diffraction analysis before the presentation. = 他们在演示之前已经完成了衍射分析。

将来时:
We will use diffraction techniques to analyze the sample. = 我们将使用衍射技术来分析样品。
Scientists will further investigate the phenomenon of diffraction. = 科学家们将进一步研究衍射现象。


虚拟语气:
If the aperture were smaller, the diffraction would be greater. = 如果孔径更小，衍射就会更大。
It would be helpful if we had more accurate diffraction data. = 如果我们有更精确的衍射数据，那就太好了。


被动语态:

What causes diffraction? = 什么导致衍射？
How is diffraction used in technology? = 衍射在技术中是如何使用的？


否定句:
The results did not show significant diffraction. = 结果没有显示明显的衍射。
There was no observable diffraction in the experiment. = 在实验中没有观察到衍射。


PHRASE->

Neutron diffraction: 中子衍射
Diffraction grating: 衍射光栅
Fraunhofer diffraction: 夫琅禾费衍射

词源:
From Latin *diffringere "to break up," from dis- "apart" + frangere "to break."  The scientific sense developed in the 19th century.
