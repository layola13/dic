词源:

The word "overthoughtfulness" is a relatively modern compound word formed by combining:

* **over-**:  A prefix indicating "too much," "excessively," or "beyond."
* **thoughtful**: An adjective meaning "showing consideration for the needs of other people," but in the context of "overthoughtfulness," it implies deep and often excessive thinking.  "Thoughtful" itself comes from the Old English word "þohtful," combining "þoht" (thought) and "-ful" (full).


The combination creates a word describing the condition of thinking too much, to a degree that is detrimental.
