oxidation:/ˌɒksɪˈdeɪʃən/| n. |氧化；氧化作用 |The process of oxidizing, or being oxidized.  It involves the loss of electrons or an increase in oxidation state by a molecule, atom, or ion.  Oxidation often involves the addition of oxygen or the removal of hydrogen. |例句：The oxidation of iron produces rust.  铁的氧化会产生锈。

The oxidation of glucose provides energy for the body.  葡萄糖的氧化为身体提供能量。


近义词：oxidation reaction, rusting |反义词：reduction


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Oxidation occurs naturally. = 氧化自然发生。
Iron oxidizes in the presence of air and water. = 铁在空气和水的存在下会氧化。


一般过去时:
The apple oxidized quickly after being cut. = 苹果被切开后迅速氧化。
The experiment showed that oxidation had already begun. = 实验表明氧化已经开始。


现在完成时:
The metal has oxidized significantly. = 金属已经严重氧化。
The food has oxidized, causing it to spoil. = 食物已经氧化，导致腐败。


过去完成时:
The iron had oxidized before the paint was applied. = 涂漆之前铁就已经氧化了。
The reaction had completed its oxidation phase. = 反应已经完成了它的氧化阶段。


将来时:
The fruit will oxidize if left exposed to air. = 水果如果暴露在空气中会氧化。
The experiment will demonstrate the principles of oxidation. = 实验将演示氧化的原理。


虚拟语气:
If the iron were exposed to air, it would oxidize. = 如果铁暴露在空气中，它就会氧化。
I wish the experiment had shown a slower rate of oxidation. = 我希望实验显示出较慢的氧化速度。


被动语态:
The metal was oxidized by the acid. = 金属被酸氧化了。
The process is being oxidized at an accelerated rate. = 该过程正在以加速的速度被氧化。


疑问句:
What causes the oxidation of this metal? = 什么导致这种金属的氧化？
How can we prevent the oxidation of the food? = 我们如何防止食物氧化？


否定句:
The metal did not oxidize easily. = 金属不易氧化。
The substance does not undergo rapid oxidation. = 该物质不会发生快速氧化。


PHRASE->
oxidation state = 氧化态
oxidation number = 氧化数
oxidation potential = 氧化电位
catalytic oxidation = 催化氧化
thermal oxidation = 热氧化

词源:
From  "oxid-" (from oxygen) + "-ation" (process of).  The word reflects the historical understanding of oxidation primarily involving oxygen.  However, the modern definition is broader, encompassing electron transfer.
