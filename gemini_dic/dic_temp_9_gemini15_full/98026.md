词源:
The word "inordinately" comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") + "ordinate" (meaning "arranged in order, regular, or proper").  Therefore, "inordinately" literally means "not in proper order" or "excessively".  The word "ordinate" itself traces back to Latin "ordinatus," the past participle of "ordinare" (to arrange).
