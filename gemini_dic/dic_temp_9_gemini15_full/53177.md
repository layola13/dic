diprismatic: /ˌdaɪprɪzˈmætɪk/ | adj. | 双棱镜的；双折射的 |  Relating to or resembling a diprism; exhibiting double refraction.  A diprism is an optical device consisting of two prisms placed base to base, used to produce interference fringes.  The term "diprismatic" describes materials or phenomena that show the characteristic splitting of light into two rays due to double refraction. | The diprismatic effect was clearly visible in the calcite crystal.  双棱镜效应在方解石晶体中清晰可见。|  birefringent, doubly refracting | isotropic (antonym, in the context of optical properties)


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The calcite crystal exhibits a diprismatic effect. = 方解石晶体表现出双棱镜效应。
This material shows diprismatic behavior. =这种材料表现出双棱镜行为。

一般过去时:
The scientist observed a diprismatic pattern in the experiment. = 科学家在实验中观察到双棱镜图案。
The researchers analyzed the diprismatic properties of the sample. = 研究人员分析了样品的双棱镜特性。

现在完成时:
Scientists have observed diprismatic effects in various crystals. = 科学家已经在各种晶体中观察到双棱镜效应。
Researchers have studied the diprismatic nature of light. = 研究人员已经研究了光的双棱镜性质。

过去完成时:
They had already analyzed the diprismatic data before the presentation. = 他们在演示文稿之前已经分析了双棱镜数据。
The team had not yet discovered the cause of the diprismatic phenomenon. = 该团队尚未发现双棱镜现象的原因。

将来时:
The experiment will demonstrate the diprismatic properties of the new material. = 实验将演示新材料的双棱镜特性。
We will further investigate the diprismatic effect in the future. = 我们将来会进一步研究双棱镜效应。


虚拟语气:
If the crystal were perfectly isotropic, it wouldn't exhibit a diprismatic effect. = 如果晶体是完全各向同性的，它就不会表现出双棱镜效应。
I wish I had better equipment to study the diprismatic behavior more precisely. = 我希望我有更好的设备来更精确地研究双棱镜行为。


被动语态:
The diprismatic effect was measured using a polarimeter. = 双棱镜效应是用偏振计测量的。
The diprismatic properties of the material are being investigated. = 正在研究该材料的双棱镜特性。


疑问句:
Does this material show diprismatic behavior? = 这种材料是否表现出双棱镜行为？
What causes the diprismatic effect in this crystal? = 这种晶体的双棱镜效应是什么原因造成的？


否定句:
The sample did not exhibit a significant diprismatic effect. = 样本没有表现出明显的双棱镜效应。
The crystal is not diprismatic under normal conditions. = 在正常条件下，晶体不是双棱镜的。


PHRASE->
(There are no common phrases directly using "diprismatic". The term is highly specialized.)  The usage is primarily within scientific contexts describing optical properties.
