The word "caballer" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you intended another word? Please double-check your spelling.
* **A proper noun:** It could be a surname or place name, but without more context, it's impossible to say.
* **A word from another language:** It might be a word from Spanish, French, or another language. If you can provide the language of origin, I can try to provide a translation and explanation.


To get a proper analysis, please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
