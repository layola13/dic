词源:
The word "precipitate" comes from the Latin word "praecipitare," which means "to throw headlong," "to hurl down," or "to hasten."  The sense of "to throw down" led to the chemical meaning of causing a substance to separate from a solution, and from there, the metaphorical meaning of causing something to happen suddenly or unexpectedly developed.
