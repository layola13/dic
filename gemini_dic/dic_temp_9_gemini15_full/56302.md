词源:
The word "doggerel" ultimately derives from the Old French word *docreler*, meaning "to make doggerel".  The exact etymology is uncertain, but it may be connected to the Old French word *docrer*, meaning "to gild" or "to adorn superficially," suggesting a superficial or poorly executed form of poetry.  The modern English word evolved through Middle English forms.
