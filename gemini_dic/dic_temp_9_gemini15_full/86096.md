词源:

The word "heart-searching" is a compound word.  "Heart" refers to the center of one's emotions and feelings, while "searching" implies a thorough and careful examination. The combination suggests a deep and thorough examination of one's own feelings and motivations.  The etymology traces back to the individual words "heart" (Old English *heorte, from Proto-Germanic *herto) and "search" (Old French *cerchier, from Vulgar Latin *circare).  The combination emerged as a natural expression to describe the act of introspection and self-reflection.
