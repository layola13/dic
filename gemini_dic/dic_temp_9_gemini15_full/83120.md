词源:

The word "gustinesses" is derived from the noun "gustiness," which in turn comes from the noun "gust" (a sudden strong wind).  The suffix "-iness" adds the sense of "quality or state of being," and the final "-es" creates the plural form.  Therefore, the word's history traces back to the Old English word "gūst," possibly related to the Old Norse word "gustr," all pointing to a sense of a sudden rush or burst of something, especially air.
