premodelling:/ˌpriːˈmɒd(ə)lɪŋ/ | n. | 预建模，预先建模 | The process of creating a simplified or preliminary model before building a more complex or detailed one.  It involves identifying key variables and relationships to guide the development of the final model.  This can be used in various fields like software development, engineering, and scientific research to reduce risk and improve efficiency. | Example:  Premodelling the software architecture helped identify potential bottlenecks before coding began. 预先建模软件架构帮助在编码开始前识别潜在的瓶颈。 |近义词: preliminary modeling, initial modeling, prototyping | 反义词: post-modelling, final modeling | 名词
