词源:

The word "housebound" is a compound word.  "House" is of course the Old English word "hūs," referring to a dwelling. "Bound" in this context derives from the Old English "bunden," the past participle of "bindan," meaning "to bind" or "to confine."  Therefore, "housebound" literally means "bound to the house."
