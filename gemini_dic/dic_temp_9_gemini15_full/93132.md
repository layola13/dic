The word "igar" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or looking word?
* **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name, place, or brand name.
* **It's a word from another language:**  It could be a word borrowed from another language, and its meaning would depend on its origin.
* **It's a neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or slang term not yet widely recognized.

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you would like assistance.
