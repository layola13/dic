词源:

The term "right-brained" originates from the theory of lateralization of brain function, which suggests that different parts of the brain specialize in different cognitive functions. While there's some truth to this theory (certain functions are indeed more localized in one hemisphere or the other), the notion of strictly "right-brained" or "left-brained" individuals is an oversimplification. The two hemispheres work together in complex ways.  The term emerged in popular culture in the late 20th century, gaining widespread use as a convenient way to describe personality traits associated with creativity and intuition.


用法说明:


This adjective is used to describe individuals or their thinking styles. It's often used informally to characterize someone's personality or approach to problem-solving.  It's important to remember it's a simplification and shouldn't be taken as a rigid scientific categorization.
