catalyser: /ˈkætəlɪzər/ | n. |催化剂；刺激因素 | A substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any permanent chemical change.  It also refers to something that stimulates or accelerates a process or event. | 例句：Enzymes are biological catalysts.  酶是生物催化剂。 The new policy acted as a catalyst for economic growth.  这项新政策成为经济增长的催化剂。 | 近义词：accelerant, stimulant, agent | 反义词：inhibitor, deterrent

词源:

The word "catalyser" comes from the Greek word "kata" (down) and "lyein" (to loosen), referring to the way a catalyst breaks down reactants to form products.  The suffix "-yser" is a common agent suffix, indicating something that performs an action.  The word was coined in the 19th century with the growing understanding of chemical catalysis.
