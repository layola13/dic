The word "parsonically" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure dialect.

To provide a helpful response, we need clarification:

1. **Is this a misspelling?**  If so, what word was intended?  Knowing the intended word will allow for a complete analysis.

2. **Is this a neologism?** If so, what is the intended meaning and how is it constructed?  Providing context (where you encountered this word) would be very helpful.

3. **Is this a word from a specialized dialect or field?** If so, specifying the field will help in finding a definition.

Once the correct word or its intended meaning is clarified, I can provide the requested analysis in the specified format, including pronunciation (IPA), word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical illustrations.
