词源:
From *pink* + *-ness*, the suffix forming nouns of state or quality.  The word "pink" itself has a complex etymology, possibly originating from a Middle Dutch word meaning "to wink" or "to blink," referring to the blinking of the eyes or a similar flickering light.  The connection to the color is less clear but may have to do with the color of the eye or flower.
