overfruitfulnesses:/ˌoʊvərˈfruːtfʊlnəsɪz/ | n. |过度丰饶；结果过多 |The word "overfruitfulnesses" is a relatively rare and unusual word, formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning excessive or too much) to "fruitfulness," and then adding the plural suffix "-es."  It refers to instances of excessive fruitfulness or productivity, often implying an undesirable abundance or a negative consequence of too much production.  There is no direct single-word synonym.  The word is not commonly used and its usage would be very specific to a particular context.  Examples would be needed to clarify its intended meaning in any given situation. There are no common antonyms, as the opposite would simply be less fruitfulness or normal fruitfulness.
