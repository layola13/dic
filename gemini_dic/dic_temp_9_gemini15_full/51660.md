词源:
The word "device" comes from the Old French word "devis," meaning "invention, plan, design." This in turn derives from the Latin verb "dividere," meaning "to divide," suggesting the idea of separating or distinguishing components to create something new.  The evolution reflects the concept of a device as something cleverly constructed or assembled from different parts.
