nonterm:/ˈnɒn.tɜːrm/ | n. |非终结符|A nonterminal symbol in formal language theory, especially in context-free grammars, is a symbol that can be replaced by a sequence of other symbols, including other nonterminals or terminals.  It represents a syntactic category or a phrase in the grammar. Unlike terminal symbols, which are the actual words or characters of the language, nonterminals are placeholders for more complex structures. |Example: In the grammar rule "sentence → noun phrase verb phrase", "sentence", "noun phrase", and "verb phrase" are nonterminals.  "The cat sat on the mat."  Here, "The cat" is a noun phrase, and "sat on the mat" is a verb phrase.  |近义词：syntactic category, phrase structure, intermediate symbol |反义词：terminal symbol


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the context of computer science and linguistics (formal language theory), thus a typical usage example in everyday conversation is not applicable.  Instead, the following demonstrates its use within the formal context:

Grammar Rule Example:
S → NP VP  =  A sentence (S) consists of a noun phrase (NP) and a verb phrase (VP). Here, S, NP, and VP are nonterminals.


Derivation Example:
S → NP VP → Det N V Prep NP → The cat sat on the mat.  =  The derivation shows how the nonterminal symbols are progressively replaced by other symbols until only terminal symbols (words) remain.  S, NP, VP, Det, N, V, Prep are all nonterminals at some point in this derivation.
