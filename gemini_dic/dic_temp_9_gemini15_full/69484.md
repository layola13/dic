feldspathose:/ˈfɛldˌspætˌoʊz/| n.|长石岩|Feldspathose refers to a rock composed predominantly of feldspar minerals.  It's not a strictly defined geological term like granite or basalt, and its composition can vary.  The term emphasizes the abundance of feldspar.  Often, it’s used informally or in less technical contexts.  A more precise description would require specifying the type(s) of feldspar present and other constituent minerals.|Example: The hillside was primarily composed of feldspathose, with visible crystals of orthoclase and plagioclase.  山坡主要由长石岩构成，可见正长石和斜长石晶体。|近义词:feldspar-rich rock,  (depending on specific composition) granite, syenite, diorite |反义词:  (no direct antonym, but rocks with minimal feldspar could be considered opposite)|名词

USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb or adjective forms. Therefore, grammatical tenses and voice don't apply directly to the word itself.  However, we can use it in various sentence structures:

一般现在时:
The sample contains a significant amount of feldspathose. = 样本含有大量的长石岩。
This region is known for its deposits of feldspathose. = 这个地区以其长石岩矿床而闻名。


一般过去时:
Geologists identified feldspathose in the ancient strata. = 地质学家在古代地层中发现了长石岩。
The analysis revealed the presence of feldspathose. = 分析显示存在长石岩。


现在完成时:
Researchers have discovered new feldspathose formations. = 研究人员发现了新的长石岩地层。
They have studied the properties of feldspathose for years. = 他们多年来一直在研究长石岩的特性。


过去完成时:
Before the expedition, they had hypothesized the existence of feldspathose.  = 在考察之前，他们曾假设存在长石岩。
Scientists had already mapped the feldspathose distribution. = 科学家们已经绘制了长石岩的分布图。


将来时:
They will analyze the feldspathose samples next week. = 他们下周将分析长石岩样本。
Future research will focus on the origin of the feldspathose. = 未来的研究将集中在长石岩的起源上。


被动语态:
The feldspathose was carefully examined under a microscope. = 长石岩在显微镜下被仔细检查。
The age of the feldspathose is being determined. = 长石岩的年龄正在确定中。


疑问句:
Is this rock primarily feldspathose? = 这块岩石主要是长石岩吗？
What is the mineral composition of the feldspathose? = 长石岩的矿物成分是什么？


否定句:
The rock sample was not composed entirely of feldspathose. = 岩石样本并非完全由长石岩构成。
This area does not contain significant deposits of feldspathose. = 这个地区不包含大量的长石岩矿床。
