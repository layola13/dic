词源:
The word "scattered" comes from the Old English word *scaterian, meaning "to scatter, disperse."  This is related to the Proto-Germanic word *skaterjan, and ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *sker-, meaning "to cut, separate."  The sense of spreading things apart from a central point developed from this earlier meaning.
