词源:

The word is derived from the adjective "disadvantageous," which itself comes from the noun "disadvantage."  "Dis-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of," "advantage" derives from Old French "avantage" meaning "profit, gain," ultimately from Vulgar Latin *advantagium, a derivative of Latin *ad- ("to," "toward") + *vantagia ("profit, gain"). Thus, "disadvantageousness" signifies the state of lacking profit or gain; being at a disadvantage.
