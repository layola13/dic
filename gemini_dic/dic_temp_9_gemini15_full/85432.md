The word "hasakura" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a Japanese word.  Therefore, a standard English-language dictionary entry is impossible.  To provide a response, we need more context. Is it a name, a place name, or a word with a specific meaning in a particular context?


If you can provide more information about where you encountered this word, I can try to help you understand its meaning and provide a similar analysis as requested in the example.  For instance, providing the sentence or text where it appears would be immensely helpful.
