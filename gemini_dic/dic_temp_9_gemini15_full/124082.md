词源:The name "morris dance" is believed to derive from the Moorish dancers who visited England in the Middle Ages.  However, the exact etymology is debated, with some suggesting a connection to the word "moore" (meaning "dark" or "black"), referring to the dancers' costumes, and others pointing to a possible connection with the ancient Greek god, Morpheus.  The dances themselves evolved over centuries, incorporating various influences and regional variations.
