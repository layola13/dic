The word "misken" is not a standard English word.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a word from another language (possibly a dialect or archaic form), or a proper noun.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis following your requested format.  To help me assist you, please provide more context:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (book, website, conversation, etc.)
* **What was the surrounding text or conversation?** This will help determine the intended meaning.

Once I have this information, I can try to determine the correct spelling or identify its origin and meaning.
