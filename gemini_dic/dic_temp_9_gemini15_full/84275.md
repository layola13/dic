词源:


The word is a compound of "half," indicating a partial or incomplete state, and "tearfulness," describing the condition of being tearful or sad.  "Tearfulness" itself derives from "tear" (a drop of salty liquid secreted from the eye) + "-ful" (a suffix indicating "full of").  Therefore, the entire word signifies a state of being partially or slightly sad, close to tears but not openly weeping.
