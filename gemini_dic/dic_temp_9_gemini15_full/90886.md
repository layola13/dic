hunky-dory:/ˈhʌŋki ˈdɔːri/| adj.|一切顺利的，美好的，完美的| Everything is fine; excellent; satisfactory.  The term likely originated as a playful alteration of "hunky" (meaning "good-looking, attractive" in the sense of a man) and "dory" (a type of boat). It's unclear how these unrelated words came to be combined to create this idiomatic expression. The meaning shifted from a description of physical attractiveness to a general sense of well-being and contentment.|例句：Everything is hunky-dory now that the problem is solved.  现在问题解决了，一切都很顺利。

例句：The project is going hunky-dory, and we are ahead of schedule. 项目进展顺利，我们提前完成了进度。
