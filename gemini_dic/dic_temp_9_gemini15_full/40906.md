coolant:/ˈkuːlənt/| n.|冷却剂，冷却液|A substance used to lower the temperature of something, especially in an engine.|例句：The car's coolant was low, so I added more.  汽车冷却液不足，所以我加了一些。|例句：The nuclear reactor requires a constant flow of coolant to prevent overheating. 核反应堆需要持续的冷却剂流量来防止过热。|近义词：refrigerant, cooling agent|反义词:heating agent


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The coolant circulates through the engine. = 冷却剂在发动机中循环。
This coolant protects the engine from overheating. =  这种冷却剂保护发动机免受过热。

一般过去时:
The mechanic checked the coolant level. = 技工检查了冷却液的液位。
The coolant leaked from the radiator. = 冷却液从散热器泄漏了。

现在完成时:
The engine has overheated because the coolant has leaked. = 发动机过热是因为冷却液泄漏了。
We have already added the coolant to the system. = 我们已经向系统添加了冷却剂。


过去完成时:
The engine had already overheated before we noticed the low coolant level. = 在我们注意到冷却液液位低之前，发动机就已经过热了。
They had changed the coolant just a week before the problem occurred. = 他们在问题发生前一周刚刚更换了冷却剂。

将来时:
The mechanic will check the coolant next week. = 技工下周将检查冷却剂。
We will need to replace the coolant soon. = 我们很快需要更换冷却剂。


虚拟语气:
If the coolant was leaking, the engine would overheat. = 如果冷却液泄漏，发动机就会过热。
I wish I had checked the coolant level earlier. = 我希望我早点检查冷却液液位。

被动语态:
The coolant is circulated by a pump. = 冷却剂由泵循环。
The engine was damaged because the coolant wasn't properly maintained. = 发动机损坏是因为冷却剂没有得到妥善维护。

疑问句:
Is the coolant level sufficient? = 冷却液液位是否足够？
What type of coolant should I use? = 我应该使用哪种类型的冷却剂？

否定句:
The coolant is not circulating properly. = 冷却剂没有正常循环。
The system does not have enough coolant. = 系统没有足够的冷却剂。


PHRASE->
coolant leak = 冷却液泄漏
coolant system = 冷却系统
engine coolant = 发动机冷却液
coolant reservoir = 冷却液储液罐
coolant temperature = 冷却液温度
