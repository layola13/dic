词源:

The word is a compound of "pro-" (meaning "in favor of" or "supporting") and "administration" (referring to the government or those in power).  The prefix "pro-" derives from Latin, and "administration" has roots in Latin as well, stemming from "administrare" (to manage or govern).


用法说明：

This word is primarily used as an adjective to describe individuals, groups, or entities that openly support the current government.  It is often used in political discussions and analyses.  The connotation can be neutral, but it can also carry a negative implication, suggesting blind allegiance or a lack of critical thinking.  The term is generally applied in contexts where there's a clear distinction between the governing power and opposition forces.
