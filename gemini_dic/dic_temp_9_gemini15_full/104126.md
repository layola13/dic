jumpweld:/ˈdʒʌmpˌwɛld/ | n. | 熔接，跳焊 | A type of welding process where an arc is struck between two pieces of metal to be joined, without the use of a continuous filler metal.  The heat from the arc melts the edges of the metal, and capillary action draws the molten metal together to form a weld.  It's often used for joining thinner materials. | Example: The technician used a jump weld to repair the crack in the sheet metal. 技术人员用跳焊修复了钣金上的裂缝。|近义词：spot weld, flash weld |反义词：无
