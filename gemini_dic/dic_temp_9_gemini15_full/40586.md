词源：

From Old French *connoisseur, from Old French connoistre "to know," from Vulgar Latin *cognoscere, from Latin *cognoscere "to get to know."  The word ultimately derives from the Latin "cognoscere," meaning "to know" or "to learn."


用法说明：

Connoisseur is almost always used as a noun.  It implies a deep understanding and appreciation, often gained through experience and study, rather than simply liking something.  It carries a positive connotation, suggesting sophistication and refined taste.  There is no verb form of "connoisseur."
