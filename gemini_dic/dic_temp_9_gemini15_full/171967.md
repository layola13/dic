词源:
The word "purblind" comes from the Old English words "pur" meaning "pure" or "thorough," and "blind," referring to a complete or nearly complete loss of sight.  Over time, the "pure" element evolved into a sense of incompleteness or imperfection, leading to the current meaning of "partially blind" or "having poor eyesight."  The figurative meaning developed from the literal, associating poor eyesight with poor judgment or understanding.
