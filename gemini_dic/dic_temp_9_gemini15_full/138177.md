The word "norwegium" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant "Norwegian," referring to something related to Norway.
2. **A neologism:** A newly coined word not yet in common usage.
3. **A proper noun:** A name for a specific thing, place, or person.  More context is needed.
4. **A made-up word:**  It could be entirely fictional.
