nonrecessive:/ˌnɒnɹɪˈsɛsɪv/| adj. |非隐性的，显性的|Not recessive; expressing itself in the phenotype even when heterozygous.  A nonrecessive gene or trait will be expressed even if only one copy is present. This is in contrast to recessive genes, which require two copies to be expressed. |Example: The gene for brown eyes is nonrecessive; therefore, a person with one brown-eye gene and one blue-eye gene will have brown eyes.  棕色眼睛的基因是非隐性的；因此，一个拥有一个棕色眼睛基因和一个蓝色眼睛基因的人将会拥有棕色眼睛。|近义词：dominant, expressed|反义词：recessive


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in genetics and biology contexts.  Therefore, typical grammatical tenses and sentence structures are not applicable in the same way as with words like "what".  Instead, examples will focus on how "nonrecessive" functions in scientific writing and explanations.


Example sentences illustrating the use of "nonrecessive" in different sentence structures:


Simple Sentence: The nonrecessive allele for tallness is dominant over the recessive allele for shortness.  身高显性等位基因比身高隐性等位基因更强大。


Compound Sentence:  The trait is nonrecessive, and therefore it appears in the offspring even when only one parent carries the gene.  该性状是非隐性的，因此即使只有一个亲本携带该基因，它也会出现在后代中。


Complex Sentence: Because the gene for red flower color is nonrecessive, a plant with one red-flower gene and one white-flower gene will have red flowers. 因为红色花朵颜色的基因是非隐性的，所以一个拥有一个红色花朵基因和一个白色花朵基因的植物将会开红色的花。


Passive Voice: The nonrecessive nature of the gene was confirmed by the experimental results. 基因的非隐性性质已通过实验结果得到证实。


PHRASE->
There aren't common idiomatic phrases that directly use "nonrecessive".  Its usage is highly specialized.  Phrases would be constructed around the concept of nonrecessive inheritance, for example:


"Nonrecessive inheritance pattern" 非隐性遗传模式
"Nonrecessive gene expression" 非隐性基因表达
"Exhibiting nonrecessive traits" 表现出非隐性性状
"Analysis of nonrecessive alleles" 非隐性等位基因分析
"Presence of a nonrecessive factor"  存在非隐性因素
