The word "roosa" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps you could provide more context.
* **A proper noun:** It might be a name (person, place, or thing) specific to a particular region or culture.
* **A neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or a word used informally within a specific group.
* **A word from another language:**  It's possible "roosa" comes from another language and isn't directly translatable into English without further information.


To help me provide the analysis you requested, please clarify the word's origin or provide more context about where you encountered it.
