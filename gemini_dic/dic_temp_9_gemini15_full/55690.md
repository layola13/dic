词源:
The word "dizzinesses" is derived from the adjective "dizzy," meaning feeling unsteady or lightheaded.  "Dizzy" ultimately comes from the Old English word "dysig," meaning "foolish" or "stupid," though the connection between the modern meaning and this archaic sense isn't entirely clear.  The "-ness" suffix creates the noun "dizziness," meaning the state of being dizzy. The addition of "-es" forms the plural.
