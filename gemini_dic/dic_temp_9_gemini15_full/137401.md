nontentativenesses:  /ˌnɒnˌkɒntɛnˈteɪtɪvnəsɪz/ | n. | 不确定性(复数) | The word "nontentativenesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a non-standard plural form of a non-standard word.  It's likely formed by combining a prefix ("non-") meaning "not" with a root related to "contentment" or "tentativeness," then adding a plural "-es". The intended meaning would be multiple instances of a lack of decisiveness or certainty. However, there's no established dictionary entry for this word.  |  This word needs to be replaced with more standard vocabulary, such as "uncertainties," "indecisions," or "doubts."  For instance, "The nontentativenesses of the committee led to a delay in the project" could be rewritten as "The committee's uncertainties led to a delay in the project." |  近义词: uncertainties, indecisions, hesitations, ambiguities, doubts | 反义词: certainties, decisivenesses, assurances |  名词
