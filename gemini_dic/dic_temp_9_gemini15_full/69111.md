词源:
The word "favela" originates from the Portuguese language. Its exact etymology is debated, but one common theory traces it back to a specific plant, *Cnidoscolus quercifolius*, also known as favela, whose thorny branches were used to build early informal settlements.  Another theory suggests it may be related to an earlier term for a type of shack or hut.
