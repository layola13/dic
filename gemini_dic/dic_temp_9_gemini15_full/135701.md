词源:
The word "nonpressure" is a modern coinage, a combination of the prefix "non-" (from Latin *non, meaning "not") and the noun "pressure."  The noun "pressure" originates from the Old French word *pressurer, ultimately derived from the Latin *pressare, meaning "to press."  Thus, "nonpressure" literally means "not pressing" or "lacking pressure."
