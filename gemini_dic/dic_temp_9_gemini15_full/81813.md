The word "gretch" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (like a name), a slang term, or a word from a very niche dialect.  To provide an analysis, more context is needed.
