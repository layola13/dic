词源:
The word is a combination of "self-" (meaning "of or by itself") and "suppressing" (from the verb "suppress," meaning "to put an end to; to subdue").  The root of "suppress" comes from the Latin "supprimere," which is formed from "sub-" (under) and "premere" (to press).  Therefore, "self-suppressing" literally means "pressing down or inhibiting from within itself."
