词源:  The word "inconveniently" is derived from the adjective "inconvenient," which itself comes from the Old French word "inconvenient," meaning "inappropriate" or "unsuitable."  The prefix "in-" means "not," and "convenient" ultimately derives from the Latin "convenire," meaning "to come together," implying suitability or appropriateness.  The adverbial suffix "-ly" was added to form the adverb "inconveniently."
