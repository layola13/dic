一般过去时:
The bacteria grew nonvirulently. = 细菌无害地生长了。
He injected the nonvirulent strain nonvirulently. = 他无害地注射了非致病性菌株。


现在完成时:
The bacteria have grown nonvirulently. = 细菌一直无害地生长。
She has injected the nonvirulent strain nonvirulently. = 她已经无害地注射了非致病性菌株。


过去完成时:
The bacteria had grown nonvirulently. = 细菌之前一直无害地生长。
He had injected the nonvirulent strain nonvirulently. = 他之前已经无害地注射了非致病性菌株。


将来时:
The bacteria will grow nonvirulently. = 细菌将无害地生长。
She will inject the nonvirulent strain nonvirulently. = 她将无害地注射非致病性菌株。


虚拟语气:
If the bacteria grew nonvirulently, the experiment would be successful. = 如果细菌无害地生长，实验就会成功。
