The word "over-grossness's" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be an improperly formed word, likely a combination of "over-grossness" (itself not a common word) and a possessive 's.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is not possible.  Let's break down why:


* **"Over-grossness"**: This seems to be an attempt to create a word suggesting an excessive or extreme degree of grossness.  "Gross" itself means unpleasant, repulsive, or distasteful.  Adding "over-" intensifies this meaning. However, the word isn't established in standard dictionaries.

* **"'s"**: This is a possessive suffix, indicating ownership or belonging.  However, its use with "over-grossness" is grammatically questionable because "over-grossness" is not a noun commonly used to possess something.


To provide a useful response, let's analyze the component parts individually and then consider how to express the intended meaning more correctly.


**Gross:**

/ɡrəʊs/ | /ɡroʊs/ | adj. | 令人作呕的；粗俗的；总的；毛利的 |  Unpleasant, repulsive, distasteful; vulgar; total; referring to income before deductions.

* **Example:** "The smell was simply gross." =  气味简直令人作呕。
* **Example:** "The movie contained some gross humor." = 这部电影包含一些粗俗的幽默。
* **Synonyms:**  disgusting, repulsive, offensive, vulgar, obscene
* **Antonyms:** pleasant, agreeable, refined, elegant


**Over- (prefix):**

/ˈoʊvər/ | prefix | 过度的；超过的 | Excessively; beyond the limit.

* **Example:** "The overcooked pasta was inedible." =  煮过头了的意大利面没法吃。
* **Example:** "He was overconfident in his abilities." = 他对自己的能力过于自信。


**To express the intended meaning (excessive grossness), one might use phrases like:**

* **Extreme grossness:** This is a straightforward and clear way to convey the meaning.
* **Utmost repulsiveness:** This emphasizes the degree of unpleasantness.
* **Unparalleled vulgarity:** This highlights the offensive nature if that's the intended aspect.
* **Excessive vulgarity/disgust:** This is a more formal way to express the meaning.


Therefore, instead of using the non-standard "over-grossness's", choose a more appropriate and grammatically correct phrase to convey your intended meaning based on the specific context.  The analysis of tenses, voices, etc., is not applicable because the original term is not a valid English word.
