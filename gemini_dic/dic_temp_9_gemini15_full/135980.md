nonradiations:/ˌnɒnˌreɪdiˈeɪʃənz/ | n. | 非辐射 |  The term "nonradiations" is not a standard or widely accepted word in the English language.  It appears to be a newly coined or very rarely used word, possibly formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") with "radiations" (plural of radiation).  Therefore, a proper definition, etymology, and usage examples are difficult to provide without more context.  If used, it would likely refer to phenomena, processes, or materials that do not emit radiation. | Example:  (Hypothetical)  The study focused on the nonradiations of certain isotopes. (此研究侧重于某些同位素的非辐射性。) | 近义词: (depending on context) non-emissions, non-irradiations | 反义词: radiations, emissions
