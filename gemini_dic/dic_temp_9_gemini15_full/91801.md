词源:

The word "hyperfeminine" is a modern coinage, combining the prefix "hyper-" (meaning "excessive" or "above") with "feminine."  "Feminine" itself derives from the Latin word *femina*, meaning "woman". Thus, hyperfeminine literally means "excessively womanly" or "exaggeratedly feminine".


用法说明:

The word "hyperfeminine" is used to describe something or someone that exhibits extremely feminine qualities, often to a degree considered stereotypical, artificial, or even excessive.  It is frequently used in discussions of gender, fashion, art, and media, often with a critical or analytical tone, suggesting that the hyperfemininity may not reflect genuine femininity but rather a constructed or imposed ideal.  The connotations can be positive, neutral, or negative depending on context and the speaker's perspective.  In some contexts, it can be used ironically or sarcastically.
