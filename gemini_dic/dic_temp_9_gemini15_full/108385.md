词源:

* **law:**  Old English *lagu*, meaning "law, right, custom".  It has Germanic roots related to words meaning "to lay down" or "to arrange."

* **breaker:** From Old English *brecan*, meaning "to break".  This verb has a long and rich history in Germanic languages, referring to the act of fracturing, violating, or disrupting something.

Therefore, "lawbreakers" literally means "those who break laws."  The word is a straightforward compound formed by combining the noun "law" with the noun "breaker" (used here as a suffix to create a noun meaning "one who breaks").
