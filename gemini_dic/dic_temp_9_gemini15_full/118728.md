metageometry:/ˌmɛtədʒiˈɒmɪtri/| n. |元几何学|The study of the properties and relationships of geometric objects that are not necessarily confined to a particular geometric space or system.  It explores concepts that transcend ordinary Euclidean geometry, considering higher-dimensional spaces, non-Euclidean geometries, and abstract geometric structures.  It often involves the study of geometries from a higher-level perspective, examining their underlying structures and relationships. |Example:  The research paper delves into the fascinating world of metageometry, exploring the connections between different geometric systems. = 这篇研究论文深入探讨了元几何学的迷人世界，探索了不同几何系统之间的联系。|近义词:higher geometry, abstract geometry|反义词:Euclidean geometry (in a relative sense)|名词
