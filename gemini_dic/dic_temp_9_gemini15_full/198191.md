词源:
The word "short-haul" is a compound word.  "Short" comes from Old English *sceort, meaning "short," and "haul" comes from Old Norse *hala, meaning "to pull" or "to drag." In this context, "haul" refers to the distance something is transported. The combination describes a transportation process covering a short distance.
