词源:

The word derives from "illiterate" (lacking education, unable to read or write), which itself comes from the prefix "il-" (not) + "literate" (educated, able to read and write). The suffix "-ness" indicates a state or condition.  Therefore, "illiteratenesses" signifies multiple states or conditions of illiteracy.

由于illiteratenesses并非常用词，故不提供语法范例和词组搭配。  其用法与illiteracy完全一致，只是强调数量上的复数。
