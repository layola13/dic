词源:

The word is a compound adjective formed from "fun" and "loving."  "Fun" originates from Middle English "fonnen," meaning "to deceive, cheat,"  but its modern meaning evolved over time to mean "enjoyment, amusement." "Loving" is derived from the Old English "lufian," meaning "to love."  The combination creates a descriptive term indicating a fondness for fun and enjoyment.
