The word "lifen" is not a standard English word. There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific jargon or dialect, or a proper noun.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide an analysis, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered "lifen".
