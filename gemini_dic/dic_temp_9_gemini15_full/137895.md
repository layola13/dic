USAGE->
This word is a relatively rare and uncommon word.  It doesn't lend itself to the typical grammatical tense examples like "what" does.  Instead, let's illustrate its use in different sentence structures:


Simple Sentence:
The nonvitalnesses of the meeting were easily overlooked. = 会议中不重要的事情很容易被忽视。

Complex Sentence:
Because of the numerous nonvitalnesses, the project was delayed. = 由于许多不重要的事情，项目被延误了。

Compound Sentence:
The report focused on key issues; the nonvitalnesses were ignored. = 报告侧重于关键问题；不重要的事情被忽略了。


Comparative Sentence:
The nonvitalnesses outweighed the important aspects in the initial proposal. = 在最初的提案中，不重要的事项超过了重要方面。

Passive Voice:
The nonvitalnesses were deemed irrelevant by the committee. = 委员会认为这些不重要的事情无关紧要。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "nonvitalnesses".  The word itself is used to convey a singular concept, not as part of a common idiom.  Instead, phrases built *around* the concept would be more useful:

lack of vital aspects = 缺乏重要方面
unnecessary details = 不必要的细节
peripheral matters = 次要问题
minor issues = 次要问题
insignificant elements = 不重要的元素


词源:

The word "nonvitalnesses" is a combination of:

* **non-**: a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of"
* **vital**:  referring to essential importance, or life itself.  Derived from the Latin "vitalis," meaning "of or pertaining to life."
* **-ness**: a suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, denoting a state, quality, or condition.
* **-es**: plural suffix

Therefore, "nonvitalnesses" literally means "the state or quality of being not vital," or the plural of things lacking vital importance.
