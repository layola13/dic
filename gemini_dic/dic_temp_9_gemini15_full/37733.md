词源:
The word "compartmentalise" is derived from the noun "compartment," which comes from the French word "compartiment," ultimately from the Latin "compartire" meaning "to share, divide."  The suffix "-alise" (or "-ize" in American English) indicates the action of making something into compartments or treating something in a compartmentalized manner.
