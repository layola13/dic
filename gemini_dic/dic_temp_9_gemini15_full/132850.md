The word "nonefficacies" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a made-up word, possibly a misspelling or an attempt to create a word meaning the opposite of efficacy or effectiveness. There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries.

Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis following the requested format.  To help you, I can offer analysis of the components:

**"Nonefficacies"** is constructed from:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of".
* **efficacies**: The plural of "efficacy," meaning the power to produce a desired result or effect.


If you intended to use a word related to lack of effectiveness, here are some alternatives you could use instead:

* **Ineffectiveness:** /ˌɪnɪˈfɛktɪvnɪs/ | n. |无效，失效 |The ineffectiveness of the treatment was evident.  治疗的无效是显而易见的。|近义词: inutility, futility |反义词: efficacy, effectiveness
* **Inefficacy:** /ˌɪnˈɛfɪkəsi/ | n. |无效，失效 |The study demonstrated the inefficacy of the new drug.  研究证明了新药的无效。|近义词: ineffectiveness, impotence |反义词: efficacy, effectiveness
* **Lack of efficacy:** This phrase directly conveys the absence of effectiveness.  The lack of efficacy in the new policy was concerning. 新政策的无效令人担忧。
