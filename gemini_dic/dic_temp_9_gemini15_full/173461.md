quasi-experimentally: /ˈkwɑːzaɪɪkˌspɛrɪˈmɛntəli/ | adv. | 准实验地 |

英文解析:In a manner resembling or approximating a true experiment, but lacking some of its essential features, such as random assignment of subjects to groups. Quasi-experimental designs are often used when it is not feasible or ethical to randomly assign participants to conditions.  They aim to establish a cause-and-effect relationship but with less certainty than true experiments.
