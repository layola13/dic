词源:
The word "carol" ultimately derives from the Old French word "carole," meaning a "round dance," often accompanied by singing.  This in turn traces back to the medieval Latin word "choraula," which itself is a combination of Greek "choros" (dance) and "aulos" (pipe, flute).  The association with Christmas carols developed later, solidifying over time.
