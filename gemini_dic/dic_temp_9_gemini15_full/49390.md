The word "delit" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you intended a different word?  If you can provide the correct spelling or context where you encountered this word, I can help.

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, a technical term in a specific field, or slang used within a particular community.  Again, more context is needed.

3. **It's a word from another language:**  It could be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into standard English.  Providing the language's origin would be helpful.


Without further information, I cannot provide an analysis. Please clarify the word or its context.
