quasi-charitably: /ˈkwɑːzaɪ ˈtʃærɪtəbli/ | adv. |近乎慈善地，似是而非地慈善地 |  The word combines "quasi" (meaning seemingly, apparently, or to a certain extent) and "charitably" (meaning in a charitable manner).

It often implies a degree of self-interest or ulterior motive hidden beneath the surface of apparent generosity. |例句：He donated a small sum quasi-charitably, more to improve his public image than out of genuine compassion. 他捐了一小笔钱，近乎慈善地，与其说是出于真正的同情，不如说是为了改善他的公众形象。|近义词：altruistically (but with reservations), seemingly charitably, ostensibly charitably |反义词：selfishly, greedily, spitefully |副词
