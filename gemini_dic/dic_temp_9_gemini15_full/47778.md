This technique is often used in winemaking to remove sediment from the wine. |例句：Decantation is a crucial step in winemaking to separate the sediment from the clear liquid. 倾析是酿酒中至关重要的一步，用于将沉淀物与澄清的液体分离。

例句：The chemist carefully performed the decantation to obtain a clear solution.  化学家小心地进行了倾析以获得澄清的溶液。


近义词：pouring off, sedimentation, clarification |反义词：mixing, agitation


词源：From Late Latin *dēcantāre, from Latin dē- ("from, off") + cantāre ("to pour").  The word ultimately derives from the Proto-Italic root *kant- ("to sing, chant," which is etymologically related to "cantare"). While seemingly unrelated to pouring, this root suggests an origin in the rhythmic action involved in carefully pouring a liquid.
