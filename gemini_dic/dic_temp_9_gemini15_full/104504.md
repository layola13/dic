kaleidophone:/ˈkælaɪdəfoʊn/ | n. | 彩虹电话；万花筒式声学仪器 | A kaleidophone is a scientific instrument demonstrating the principles of vibration and resonance.  It consists of a series of rods or wires, often of different lengths and thicknesses, attached to a base. When struck, the rods vibrate at their natural frequencies, producing complex patterns of movement which are visually striking. These movements often resemble the patterns seen in a kaleidoscope, hence the name.  | Example: The physics professor used a kaleidophone to illustrate the concept of standing waves.  教授用彩虹电话来解释驻波的概念。 |近义词:  vibrating instrument, resonance demonstrator | 反义词: N/A
