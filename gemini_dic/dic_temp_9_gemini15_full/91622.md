PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "hyperbarbarous".  The word itself is so rarely used that it doesn't lend itself to common phrases.  The emphasis is on the word's standalone meaning.


词源:

The word is a combination of "hyper-" (meaning "excessive" or "beyond") and "barbarous" (meaning "uncivilized," "cruel," or "savage").  "Barbarous" itself originates from the Greek word "barbaros," referring to foreigners whose language sounded like "bar-bar" to the Greeks.  Therefore, "hyperbarbarous" signifies a level of cruelty or savagery that surpasses the typical understanding of barbarity.
