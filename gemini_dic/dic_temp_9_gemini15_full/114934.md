词源:
The word "managership" is derived from the noun "manager" and the suffix "-ship," which indicates state, condition, skill, or quality.  "Manager" itself comes from the verb "manage," ultimately from the Old French word *managier*, meaning "to handle, to control".  The "-ship" suffix is of Old English origin, akin to the German suffix "-schaft".  Therefore, the word's etymology traces back to the concept of handling or controlling, evolving into the modern understanding of managerial roles and abilities.
