词源：From Middle English *propitiouse, from Old French propicius, from Latin propitius, meaning "favorable," "kind," or "gracious."  The Latin word is related to propitiare, meaning "to appease," "to conciliate," or "to make propitious."  This suggests an earlier meaning linked to appeasing deities to ensure favorable outcomes.
