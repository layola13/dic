词源:  The word "cajole" comes from the Old French word "cajouler," which meant "to chatter," "to babble," or "to coax."  This, in turn, may be related to a now-obsolete French word, "cajou," meaning "a kind of bird." The connection isn't entirely clear, but the sense of gentle, persistent persuasion seems to have evolved from the original meaning.
