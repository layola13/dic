dereferencing:/ˌdiːˈrefərənsɪŋ/ | v. |取消引用；间接引用；解除引用 |The act of accessing the value stored at a memory address pointed to by a pointer.  This involves retrieving the data held at the location indicated by the pointer.  In programming, it's a crucial operation for manipulating data indirectly. |Example:  In C++, dereferencing a pointer `*ptr` accesses the value stored at the memory address held by `ptr`.  The statement `int x = *ptr;` dereferences `ptr` and assigns its value to `x`.  |近义词：accessing, retrieving |反义词：referencing (in the context of pointers)

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The program dereferences the pointer. = 程序取消引用指针。
He dereferences the variable each time. = 他每次都取消引用变量。


一般过去时:
The programmer dereferenced the pointer incorrectly. = 程序员错误地取消了指针的引用。
She dereferenced the null pointer, causing a crash. = 她取消了空指针的引用，导致程序崩溃。


现在完成时:
The system has dereferenced the memory address successfully. = 系统已成功取消了内存地址的引用。
We have dereferenced all the pointers in the list. = 我们已经取消了列表中所有指针的引用。


过去完成时:
The program had dereferenced the pointer before the error occurred. = 错误发生之前，程序已经取消了指针的引用。
They had dereferenced the variable multiple times. = 他们已经多次取消了变量的引用。


将来时:
The function will dereference the pointer when it is called. = 调用该函数时，它将取消指针的引用。
The program will dereference the array elements sequentially. = 程序将依次取消数组元素的引用。


虚拟语气:
If the pointer were valid, the program would dereference it. = 如果指针有效，程序将取消其引用。
I wish I had not dereferenced the null pointer. = 我真希望我没有取消空指针的引用。


被动语态:
The pointer is dereferenced by the function. = 指针由函数取消引用。
The memory address was dereferenced improperly. = 内存地址被错误地取消了引用。


疑问句:
Does the function dereference the pointer? = 该函数是否取消了指针的引用？
Where is the pointer being dereferenced? = 指针在哪里被取消引用？


否定句:
The function does not dereference the pointer directly. = 该函数不会直接取消指针的引用。
The program did not dereference the invalid pointer. = 程序没有取消无效指针的引用。


PHRASE->
pointer dereferencing = 指针解除引用
dereferencing a pointer = 取消指针引用
null pointer dereferencing = 空指针解除引用
safe dereferencing = 安全解除引用
dereferencing operator = 解引用运算符
