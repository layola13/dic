Etymology:

The word "long-sighted" is a compound word.  "Long" signifies distance or duration, while "sighted" derives from "sight," meaning vision or perception.  The combination implies the ability to see things far away (literally) or to perceive future consequences (figuratively).  The "-sighted" suffix is related to the Old English word "sihþ," meaning "sight."
