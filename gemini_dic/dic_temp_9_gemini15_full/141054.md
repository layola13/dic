词源:

The phrase "only too" is a somewhat archaic idiom.  "Only" here doesn't mean "exclusively," but rather acts as an intensifier, similar to "very" or "exceedingly."  The "too" retains its traditional meaning of "to an excessive degree."  The combination creates an emphasis on the degree of the following adjective or participle.  The origin lies in the intensifying use of "only" which has roots in Old English and has evolved over time to express this emphatic function.


用法说明:

It is primarily used in the following structure:
