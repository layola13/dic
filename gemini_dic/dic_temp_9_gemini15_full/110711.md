WORD ORIGIN->
The word "lined-out" is a compound adjective formed from the past participle of the verb "to line" and the preposition "out."  "To line" in this context means to draw a line through something.  The "out" adds emphasis to the action of lining or crossing something out.  The origin of "to line" traces back to Old English "linian," meaning "to mark with lines."
