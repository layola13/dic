microinstructions:/ˌmaɪkroʊɪnˈstrʌkʃənz/| n.|微指令|A microinstruction is a low-level instruction executed by the control unit of a central processing unit (CPU).  It's a single step in a longer process, often corresponding to a single machine cycle.  Unlike higher-level instructions that the programmer directly uses (such as ADD or JUMP), microinstructions are typically hidden from the programmer and managed internally by the CPU's hardware. They are used to control the various components of the CPU, such as the ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), registers, and memory. |The CPU executes a sequence of microinstructions to perform a single machine instruction. This allows for complex instructions to be broken down into smaller, manageable steps.|近义词：micro-operations, sub-instructions|反义词：macroinstructions, high-level instructions|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:

疑问句:
How many microinstructions are needed to perform an addition? = 执行加法需要多少条微指令？
What is the format of the microinstructions in this CPU? = 此CPU中微指令的格式是什么？


否定句:
The CPU does not directly execute high-level instructions. = CPU不直接执行高级指令。
The microinstructions did not contain any errors. = 微指令不包含任何错误。
