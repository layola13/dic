rheotrope:/ˈriːətroʊp/| n. |变流器，转向器|A rheotrope is a device that regulates the flow of electricity, typically by varying resistance.  It's often used in older electrical systems or specialized applications.  The term is less common now due to the prevalence of more modern electronic controls.|Example: The rheotrope controlled the speed of the old motor.  变流器控制着旧发动机的速度。|近义词：variable resistor, potentiometer|反义词： (no direct antonym,  the opposite function would be a device that completely cuts off or switches the current)|名词

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The rheotrope controls the current flow. = 变流器控制电流。
This rheotrope regulates the motor speed. = 这个变流器调节电机的速度。

一般过去时:
The technician adjusted the rheotrope. = 技术人员调整了变流器。
The old rheotrope failed yesterday. = 旧变流器昨天坏了。

现在完成时:
They have installed a new rheotrope. = 他们安装了一个新的变流器。
We have been using this rheotrope for years. = 我们已经使用这个变流器多年了。

过去完成时:
The motor had stopped because the rheotrope had malfunctioned. = 电机停止运转是因为变流器出现故障。
Before the experiment, they had calibrated the rheotrope. = 实验前，他们已经校准了变流器。

将来时:
They will replace the rheotrope next week. = 他们下周将更换变流器。
We will need a new rheotrope for the project. = 我们这个项目需要一个新的变流器。

虚拟语气:
If we had a better rheotrope, the experiment would have been more successful. = 如果我们有一个更好的变流器，实验就会更成功。
I wish we had tested the rheotrope before installation. = 我希望我们在安装之前测试过变流器。

被动语态:
The rheotrope was adjusted by the engineer. = 变流器由工程师调整。
The current flow is controlled by the rheotrope. = 电流由变流器控制。


疑问句:
Is this rheotrope still functioning properly? = 这个变流器还能正常工作吗？
What type of rheotrope do we need for this application? = 我们这个应用需要哪种类型的变流器？

否定句:
The rheotrope doesn't work anymore. = 变流器不再工作了。
We didn't have enough rheotropes for all the experiments. = 我们没有足够的变流器来做所有实验。


PHRASE->
rheotrope control = 变流器控制
rheotrope adjustment = 变流器调整
rheotrope setting = 变流器设置
rheotrope resistance = 变流器电阻
rheotrope calibration = 变流器校准
