The word "nonfrequence" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  If it was intended to be a word, it might be a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "frequency," attempting to create a word meaning "lack of frequency" or "infrequency."

Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested in the format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I'll analyze the word "infrequency" instead, which accurately captures the intended meaning.
