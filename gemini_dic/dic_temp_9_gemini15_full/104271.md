The word "justes" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Possible candidates depending on context could include "justice," "just," or a proper noun.

2. **It's a neologism or archaic word:** It might be a newly coined word, a word from a specific dialect, or a word no longer in common use.  If you encountered it in a specific text, providing the context would be helpful.

3. **It's a word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into standard English.  Again, context is crucial.
