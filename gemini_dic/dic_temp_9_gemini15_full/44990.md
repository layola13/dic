crystallizers:/ˈkrɪstəlaɪzər/| n. |结晶器|A crystallizer is a piece of equipment used in chemical engineering and other industries to create crystals from a solution.  It works by carefully controlling factors like temperature, pressure, and the rate of cooling or evaporation to induce crystallization.  Different types of crystallizers exist, each designed for specific applications and crystal types.|例句：The chemical plant uses a sophisticated vacuum crystallizer to produce high-purity salt crystals. 化工厂使用先进的真空结晶器生产高纯度盐晶体。


The company invested in a new fluidized bed crystallizer to improve the efficiency of their sugar production. 公司投资了一台新的流化床结晶器，以提高其糖生产效率。|近义词：precipitator, crystallizing apparatus|反义词：None specifically, but the opposite action would be dissolving or melting.
