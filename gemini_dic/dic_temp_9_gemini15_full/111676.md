词源:  Derived from the verb "lock" (Old English *luccan, from Proto-Germanic *lukjanan) + the suffix "-ability" (indicating capacity or capability).  The suffix "-ability" is derived from the Latin suffix "-abilitas", which in turn comes from "-abilis", meaning "capable of being".  Therefore, "lockability" literally means "capable of being locked".
