词源:
The word "impugning" comes from the Latin word "impugnare," meaning "to fight against," "to attack," or "to oppose."  The prefix "im-" is a variant of "in-," meaning "in" or "on," and "pugnare" means "to fight."  Therefore, the word's roots clearly indicate its meaning of challenging or attacking something.
