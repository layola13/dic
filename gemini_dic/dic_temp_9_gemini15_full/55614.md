词源:
The word "disvest" comes from the Old French word "desvestir," which means "to undress" or "to strip."  The prefix "dis-" indicates removal or reversal, and "vest" is related to the Latin word "vestis," meaning "garment" or "clothing."  Therefore, the original meaning was literally to remove clothing, but the meaning has evolved to encompass the removal of anything, particularly power, property, or titles.
