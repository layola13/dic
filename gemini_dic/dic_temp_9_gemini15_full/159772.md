polygalic: /ˌpɒliˈɡælɪk/ | adj. | 多糖的；多半乳糖的 | Relating to or containing polygalacturonase, an enzyme that breaks down pectin.  Polygalic substances are often found in plant cell walls and contribute to their structure and texture. | The polygalic nature of the fruit's pectin contributed to its jam-like consistency.  | 近义词:pectinaceous | 反义词:monogalacturonic (less common antonym, as it describes a single unit, not the opposite of the overall composition)


USAGE->
