词源:
The word "sabotage" originated in French. It's derived from the French word "sabot," meaning "wooden shoe."  In the early days of industrialization, workers would sometimes throw their sabots (wooden shoes) into machinery to disrupt production. This act of disruption became associated with the word and eventually the act itself became known as "sabotage".
