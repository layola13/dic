The word "cesil" is not a standard English word. There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (a name, perhaps), or a word from a very specialized or obscure vocabulary.
