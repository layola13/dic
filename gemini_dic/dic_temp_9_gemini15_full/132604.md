nondiphthongal: /ˌnɒnˈdɪpθɒŋɡəl/ | adj. |非双元音的|Not involving or relating to a diphthong.  A diphthong is a sound formed by the combination of two vowels in a single syllable, in which the sound begins as one vowel and moves towards another (e.g., the vowel sounds in "boy," "cow," and "pie").  Therefore, nondiphthongal refers to sounds or words that do not contain these gliding vowel combinations. |Example: The pronunciation of the word "cat" is nondiphthongal, as it involves only a single vowel sound.  The word "beat" is also nondiphthongal. |近义词:monophthongal |反义词:diphthongal
