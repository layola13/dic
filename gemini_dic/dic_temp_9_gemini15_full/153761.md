pepsin:/ˈpɛpsɪn/| n. |胃蛋白酶|A digestive enzyme in the stomach that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides.|The pepsin in our stomachs helps digest the protein in meat.|近义词：protease|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Pepsin breaks down proteins. = 胃蛋白酶分解蛋白质。
The stomach secretes pepsin. = 胃分泌胃蛋白酶。


一般过去时:
The experiment showed that pepsin digested the protein. = 实验表明胃蛋白酶消化了蛋白质。
They added pepsin to the solution. = 他们向溶液中加入了胃蛋白酶。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied pepsin for many years. = 科学家们已经研究胃蛋白酶多年了。
The patient has taken pepsin supplements. = 病人一直在服用胃蛋白酶补充剂。


过去完成时:
The food had already been partially digested by pepsin before it reached the small intestine. = 食物在到达小肠之前就已经被胃蛋白酶部分消化了。
They had discovered the role of pepsin in digestion. = 他们已经发现了胃蛋白酶在消化中的作用。


将来时:
Researchers will continue to investigate the properties of pepsin. = 研究人员将继续研究胃蛋白酶的特性。
They will use pepsin in their new experiment. = 他们将在新的实验中使用胃蛋白酶。


虚拟语气:
If we had more pepsin, digestion would be faster. = 如果我们有更多的胃蛋白酶，消化就会更快。
It is important that the pepsin remains active in the stomach. = 胃蛋白酶在胃中保持活性很重要。


被动语态:
Pepsin is produced in the stomach. = 胃蛋白酶是在胃中产生的。
Proteins are broken down by pepsin. = 蛋白质被胃蛋白酶分解。


疑问句:
Does pepsin work best in an acidic environment? = 胃蛋白酶在酸性环境中效果最佳吗？
What is the optimal pH for pepsin activity? = 胃蛋白酶活性的最佳pH值是多少？


否定句:
Pepsin does not function well in alkaline conditions. = 胃蛋白酶在碱性条件下不能很好地发挥作用。
The lack of pepsin can lead to digestive problems. = 缺乏胃蛋白酶会导致消化问题。


PHRASE->
pepsinogen activation = 胃蛋白酶原激活
pepsin activity = 胃蛋白酶活性
gastric pepsin = 胃胃蛋白酶
peptic ulcer = 胃溃疡 (related, not direct phrase)
pepsin inhibitor = 胃蛋白酶抑制剂
