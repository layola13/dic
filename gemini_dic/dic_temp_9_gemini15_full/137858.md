词源:

The word "nonviolent" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "violent."  "Violent" comes from the Old French *violent, ultimately from the Latin *violentus,  meaning "forceful, vehement."  Thus, "nonviolent" literally means "not forceful" or "not using force."
