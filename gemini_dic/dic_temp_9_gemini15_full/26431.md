词源:

The word "bypass" is a compound word formed from "by" and "pass."  "By" indicates nearness or alongside, while "pass" means to go past or move beyond.  Therefore, "bypass" literally means "to pass by." The modern usage evolved from its original meaning of "a road or path that goes around a place", expanding to include the figurative sense of avoiding or circumventing something.
