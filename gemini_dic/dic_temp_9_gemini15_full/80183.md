This word is a proper noun, and therefore does not have the grammatical structures shown in the example (tense, voice, etc.).  Proper nouns don't conjugate or decline in the same way as verbs, nouns, or adjectives.  The only grammatical function it has is as a name.  Therefore sections like USAGE, PHRASE are not applicable.
