英文解析：This word is a very rare and unusual formation. It is the plural form of "interdestructiveness," which itself combines "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") with "destructiveness" (the quality of being destructive). Thus, it refers to instances of mutual destruction or the inherent tendency towards self-destruction between or among entities.  The word is highly uncommon in everyday language and more likely to appear in highly specialized or academic contexts.
