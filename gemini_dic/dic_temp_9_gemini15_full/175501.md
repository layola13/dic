词源:  The word "rams" originates from the Old English word "ramm," which itself is derived from Proto-Germanic "*rammiz."  The word's meaning has remained consistent throughout its history, referring primarily to the male sheep.  The extended meaning of "battering ram" comes from the use of a ram's head (or a similarly shaped object) as a weapon.
