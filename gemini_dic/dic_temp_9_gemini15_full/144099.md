outsatisfying: /ˌaʊtˈsætɪsfaɪɪŋ/ | adj. |令人不满意的，不能令人满意的 | exceeding satisfaction; surpassing expectations; extremely pleasing.  This word is not a standard English word.  It's a neologism, likely formed by combining "out" (meaning exceeding or surpassing) and "satisfying." However, its meaning is contradictory and illogical.  It implies both exceeding and failing to satisfy.  Therefore, it's not commonly used and should be avoided in formal writing.  A more appropriate word would depend on the intended meaning. If you mean "exceedingly satisfying," then "gratifying," "delightful," or "exhilarating" could be used. If you mean "unsatisfying," then "disappointing," "inadequate," or "unsatisfactory" would be better choices. |  There are no standard examples as this word is not in common usage. |近义词: (depending on intended, but contradictory meaning):  gratifying, delightful, exhilarating, disappointing, inadequate, unsatisfactory |反义词: (depending on intended, but contradictory meaning): unsatisfying, disappointing, satisfactory, delightful
