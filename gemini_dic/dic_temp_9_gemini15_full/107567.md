词源:
The word "landlubberish" is derived from "landlubber," a compound word combining "land" and "lubber."  "Lubber" originally meant a clumsy, awkward person, particularly one unskilled at seafaring.  The "-ish" suffix adds an adjectival quality, signifying "like" or "characteristic of."  Therefore, "landlubberish" describes something characteristic of a clumsy, inexperienced land-dweller, especially in a nautical context.
