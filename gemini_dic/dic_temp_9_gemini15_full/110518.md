The word "limbier" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling or provide more context where you encountered this word?

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a slang term, or a word specific to a particular dialect or community.  More information is needed to determine its meaning and usage.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name or place name.

Without further context, I cannot provide the requested analysis. Please provide more information.
