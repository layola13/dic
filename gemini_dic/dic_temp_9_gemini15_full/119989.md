millibar:/ˈmɪlɪbɑːr/| n. |毫巴，百帕|A millibar (mbar) is a unit of pressure equal to one thousandth of a bar, or 100 pascals.  It is commonly used in meteorology to measure atmospheric pressure. |Example: The atmospheric pressure is currently 1012 millibars.  当前大气压为1012毫巴。|近义词:hectopascal (hPa) |反义词: None (it's a unit of measurement)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The barometer reads 990 millibars. = 气压计显示为990毫巴。
Atmospheric pressure is usually measured in millibars. = 大气压力通常以毫巴为单位测量。


一般过去时:
The millibar reading was unusually low yesterday. = 昨天的毫巴读数异常低。
The storm caused the millibar pressure to drop significantly. = 暴风雨导致毫巴气压显著下降。


现在完成时:
The millibar pressure has dropped since this morning. = 自今早以来，毫巴气压下降了。
Scientists have recorded a steady increase in millibar readings. = 科学家们记录到毫巴读数稳步上升。


过去完成时:
The millibar pressure had already fallen before the rain started. = 下雨之前，毫巴气压已经下降了。
The meteorologists had predicted a significant drop in millibars. = 气象学家预测毫巴气压将大幅下降。


将来时:
The millibar pressure will likely rise tomorrow. = 明天的毫巴气压可能会上升。
We expect the millibar reading to be higher next week. = 我们预计下周的毫巴读数会更高。


虚拟语气:
If the millibar pressure were lower, the weather would be stormy. = 如果毫巴气压更低，天气就会暴风雨。
I wish the millibar pressure was more stable. = 我希望毫巴气压更稳定。


被动语态:
The millibar pressure is measured using a barometer. = 毫巴气压是用气压计测量的。
Millibar readings are frequently reported in weather forecasts. = 毫巴读数经常在天气预报中报道。


疑问句:
What is the current millibar reading? = 当前毫巴读数是多少？
How many millibars is that in hectopascals? = 那是多少百帕？


否定句:
The millibar pressure is not high enough. = 毫巴气压不够高。
The millibar reading did not change significantly. = 毫巴读数没有显著变化。


PHRASE->
millibar reading = 毫巴读数
millibar pressure = 毫巴气压
low millibars = 低气压
high millibars = 高气压
change in millibars = 毫巴变化


词源:
The word "millibar" is a combination of "milli-" (meaning one-thousandth) and "bar" (a unit of pressure).  The "bar" itself originates from the Greek word "báros" meaning "weight".
