USAGE->
This word is archaic and rarely used in modern English. Therefore, providing examples across various tenses and grammatical structures is not practical.  The word functions similarly to "enough" in its limited modern usage.

例句1: There is enow water for our needs.  =  我们的需求有足够的水。
例句2: We have had enow of this discussion. = 我们已经对这场讨论感到厌烦了。(Here, "enow" implies "enough" in the sense of having had sufficient, and thus expressing weariness)



PHRASE->
Because "enow" is archaic, there are no common modern phrases using it.
