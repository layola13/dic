词源:
The name "Portugal" is derived from the Roman name for the city of Portus Cale, located in modern-day Porto.  "Portus" means "port" or "harbor," and "Cale" is of Celtic origin, the meaning of which is uncertain, but possibly related to a tribe or geographical feature.  Over time, "Portus Cale" evolved into "Portugal."
