manasvi: /mənˈɑːsvi/ | adj. |有智慧的；聪明的；有才智的|  The word "manasvi" is derived from Sanskrit, where "manas" means "mind" and the suffix "-vi" denotes "possessing" or "full of."  Therefore, manasvi literally translates to "possessing a good mind" or "full of intellect." It describes someone who is intelligent, wise, and insightful.  The word carries a positive connotation, emphasizing mental acuity and brilliance. | 例句：He is a manasvi student, always excelling in his studies. 他是一个聪明的学生，学习总是名列前茅。


She delivered a manasvi speech that captivated the audience. 她发表了一篇精彩的演讲，吸引了听众。| 近义词：intelligent, brilliant, clever, wise, insightful | 反义词：愚蠢的,无知的,笨拙的 (There isn't a single perfect antonym in English, as the opposite would encompass a range of negative mental qualities.)  |  adj.
