词源：
From Old French *perpetrer, from Latin perpetrāre "to accomplish, complete," from per- "completely" + patrāre "to do, accomplish."  The original meaning of "to complete" gradually shifted to its current meaning of committing a crime or wrongdoing, likely due to the association of completion with bringing something bad to fruition.
