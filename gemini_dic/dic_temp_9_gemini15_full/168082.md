词源:  The word "privy" originates from the Old French word "privé," meaning "private" or "separate."  This, in turn, comes from the Latin word "privatus," the past participle of "privare," meaning "to deprive" or "to separate." The sense of "private" developed from the idea of being separated from or excluded from the public.  The addition of "to" creates a prepositional phrase indicating the object of the knowledge or secret.
