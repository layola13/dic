词源:
The word "desensitized" comes from the verb "desensitize," which is formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse") to the word "sensitize."  "Sensitize" itself comes from "sense" (meaning "feeling" or "perception"), ultimately deriving from Latin *sentire ("to feel").  Therefore, "desensitized" literally means "having had the sense or feeling removed or reduced."
