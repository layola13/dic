词源:
Connivency derives from the verb "connive," which comes from the Old French word "conniver," meaning "to wink at" or "to be in collusion."  The ultimate origin is Latin "connivere," which literally means "to close the eyes."  The semantic shift reflects the idea of deliberate ignorance or tacit consent to wrongdoing.
