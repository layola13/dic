equivoluminal: /ˌiːkwɪvɒˈljuːmɪnəl/ | adj. |等容的，容积相等的 |  Relating to or characterized by equal volume; maintaining constant volume.  The term is frequently used in thermodynamics and other scientific fields to describe processes where the volume remains unchanged. | Example: The reaction occurred under equivoluminal conditions, meaning the volume of the system remained constant throughout the process.  等容反应发生在等容条件下，这意味着系统的体积在整个过程中保持不变。| 近义词: isovolumetric, isochoric | 反义词:  allovoluminal (not a common term, the opposite concept would be described as a process with changing volume)
