词源:
The word "overventilate" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "ventilate" (meaning "to supply with fresh air; to breathe").  The word is a relatively modern coinage, reflecting the increased medical understanding of respiratory function and disorders.
