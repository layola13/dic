collenchyma:/kəˈlɛŋkɪmə/| n. |厚角组织|Collenchyma is a type of plant tissue that provides flexible support to growing parts of the plant.  It's composed of elongated cells with unevenly thickened cell walls, primarily made of cellulose and pectin. Unlike sclerenchyma, collenchyma cells remain alive at maturity and can continue to elongate with the plant.  This allows for support while still permitting growth. |The celery stalks are a good example of collenchyma tissue providing support and flexibility.|近义词：parenchyma (but with different functions)|反义词：sclerenchyma (provides rigid support)|名词


USAGE->

疑问句:
What is the main function of collenchyma? = 厚角组织的主要功能是什么？
Does collenchyma contain lignin? = 厚角组织含有木质素吗？

否定句:
Collenchyma does not provide rigid support like sclerenchyma. = 厚角组织不像厚壁组织那样提供坚硬的支撑。
This plant sample did not show significant collenchyma development. = 这个植物样本没有显示出明显的厚角组织发育。
