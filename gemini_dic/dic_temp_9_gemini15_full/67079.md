词源:  Derived from the verb "exploit," ultimately from the Old French "exploiter" meaning "to utilize, to make use of,"  which itself comes from the Latin "exploitare" meaning "to use fully, utilize." The "-ational" suffix transforms the verb into an adjective, describing something related to exploitation.
