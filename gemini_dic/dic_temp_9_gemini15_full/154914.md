词源:  Derived from the adjective "pesky," which in turn comes from "pesk," a now largely obsolete word meaning "to annoy" or "to trouble." The suffix "-iness" adds the meaning of "the state or quality of being."  The ultimate origin is uncertain, but it may be related to Old English words suggesting troublesome behavior.
