词源:
From French *nonchalant*, from *non-* "not" + *chalant*, from Old French *chalant*, present participle of *chaler*, from Vulgar Latin *calēre* "to be warm, to be heated," from Latin *calēre*.  The original meaning implied a lack of enthusiasm or warmth, which evolved into the modern sense of indifference.
