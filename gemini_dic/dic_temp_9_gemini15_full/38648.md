concurrency: /kənˈkɜːrənsi/ | n. | 并发性，同时发生 | The ability of multiple tasks or processes to run simultaneously, either truly parallel or through interleaving.  It often involves managing shared resources and preventing conflicts. | Example: The operating system supports high concurrency, allowing many applications to run at the same time.  操作系统支持高并发性，允许许多应用程序同时运行。|近义词：parallelism, simultaneity | 反义词：sequentiality, seriality | 名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Concurrency is crucial for modern applications. = 并发性对于现代应用程序至关重要。
The system manages concurrency effectively. = 系统有效地管理并发性。


一般过去时:
High concurrency was achieved through careful design. = 高并发性是通过精心设计实现的。
The programmer addressed concurrency issues effectively. = 程序员有效地解决了并发问题。


现在完成时:
We have improved concurrency performance significantly. = 我们已经显著提高了并发性能。
They have implemented a new concurrency model. = 他们已经实现了一个新的并发模型。


过去完成时:
The developers had considered concurrency before starting the project. = 开发人员在项目开始之前就考虑了并发性。
They had resolved the concurrency bugs before release. = 他们在发布之前解决了并发错误。


将来时:
We will use multithreading to enhance concurrency. = 我们将使用多线程来增强并发性。
The new software will support better concurrency. = 新软件将支持更好的并发性。


虚拟语气:
If we had better concurrency, the system would be faster. = 如果我们有更好的并发性，系统就会更快。
It is essential that the system handle concurrency gracefully. = 系统必须优雅地处理并发性至关重要。


被动语态:
Concurrency is handled by the operating system kernel. = 并发性由操作系统内核处理。
Concurrency issues were addressed in the latest update. = 并发问题已在最新更新中得到解决。


疑问句:
Does the database support high concurrency? = 数据库支持高并发性吗？
How is concurrency managed in this system? = 此系统如何管理并发性？


否定句:
The program doesn't handle concurrency well. = 该程序没有很好地处理并发性。
The design didn't account for concurrency issues. = 该设计没有考虑并发问题。
