Etymology:  The word "carbonised" derives from "carbon," ultimately from Latin "carbo" meaning "coal" or "charcoal," combined with the suffix "-ised," indicating a process of being made into or treated with something.  The suffix "-ised" is a variant of "-ized," both derived from the past participle of the verb "to ise/ize."
