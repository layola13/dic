The word "inmew" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?

2. **A neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a term specific to a certain community or region, or slang not yet widely documented.  If this is the case, please provide context where you encountered this word.

3. **A proper noun:** It's possible it's a name or a place name.  Again, context would be helpful.


Without more information, I cannot provide an analysis including pronunciation, word class, meaning, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc.  Please clarify the word or provide context.
