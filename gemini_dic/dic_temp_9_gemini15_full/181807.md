reliquefying: /ˌriːˈlɪkwɪfaɪɪŋ/ | v. | 再液化；重新液化 | The process of turning something that has solidified back into a liquid state.  This term is often used in scientific contexts, particularly in chemistry and physics, to describe the transition of a substance from a solid or semi-solid state back to a liquid state. | Example:  The reliquefying of the gas is crucial for the efficient operation of the system.  再液化气体对于系统的有效运行至关重要。 The researchers observed the reliquefying process under various temperature and pressure conditions. 研究人员在不同的温度和压力条件下观察了再液化过程。| 近义词: liquefaction, melting (less precise, as it usually refers to solids)| 反义词: solidification, freezing
