词源:
The word "rickshaw" is derived from the Japanese word "jinrikisha,"  which itself combines "jin" (人, meaning "person" or "human"), "riki" (力, meaning "power" or "strength"), and "sha" (車, meaning "vehicle").  Therefore, jinrikisha literally translates to "human-powered vehicle." The word entered English via Japanese.
