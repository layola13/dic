词源:
The word "harpagon" comes directly from Molière's 1668 comedy "L'Avare" (The Miser), where it is the name of the main character, a famously miserly old man.  The word itself doesn't have a deeper etymology beyond its use in this play; it essentially became a word in its own right through its association with the character.  It is not derived from a classical root like many other words.
