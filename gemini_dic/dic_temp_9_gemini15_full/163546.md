precosmical:/ˌpriːkɒˈzmɪkəl/| adj.|宇宙之前的，宇宙形成之前的|  Relating to or existing before the cosmos or universe was formed.  The term is primarily used in cosmological and philosophical contexts to describe a hypothetical state or era preceding the Big Bang or the origin of the universe as we understand it.  It's a relatively uncommon word, often found in theoretical discussions about the nature of reality and the origins of time and space.|例句：Some theories propose a precosmical state of pure energy.  一些理论提出了宇宙之前纯能量的状态。


The concept of a precosmical era is highly speculative and is not empirically verifiable.  关于宇宙之前的时代的概念是高度推测性的，并且无法通过实验证实。|近义词：antecosmic, pre-universal|反义词：cosmological, post-universal

PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "precosmical".  The word itself is highly specialized and rarely appears in common parlance.  The concept might be discussed within phrases like:  "models of the precosmical state", "theories about the precosmical era", "precosmical physics",  "evidence for a precosmical epoch", "the precosmical singularity".
