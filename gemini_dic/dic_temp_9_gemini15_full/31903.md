词源:

The word "cheesy" is believed to have originated as slang in the mid-20th century.  Its connection to cheese is somewhat obscure, but it likely relates to the idea of something being overly rich, creamy, or cloying, similar to the taste and texture of excessive cheese.  The association of "cheesy" with something artificial and inauthentic likely evolved from this initial sense.  The "-ier" suffix is a standard comparative adjective suffix in English.
