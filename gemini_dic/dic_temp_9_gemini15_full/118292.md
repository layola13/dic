词源:
The word "mercurialism" is derived from "mercury,"  the chemical element, and the suffix "-ism," which indicates a state, condition, or doctrine.  The name "mercury" itself comes from the Roman god Mercury, known for his speed and swiftness, reflecting the quick and volatile nature of the liquid metal.
