preworthily: /ˌpriːˈwɜːrðɪli/ | adv. | 预先值得地，预先配得上地 |  This word is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, formed by combining "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and "worthily" (meaning "in a way that deserves respect or praise").  Therefore, there is no established meaning, usage, synonyms, or antonyms.  Its meaning would depend entirely on the context in which it is used.  Since it's not a real word, providing grammatical examples is nonsensical.
