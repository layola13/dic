词源:

The word "nonsolidification" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the noun "solidification."  "Solidification" derives from the verb "solidify," which comes from the Latin word "solidus" (meaning "solid") + the suffix "-ification" (meaning "the act or process of").  Therefore, "nonsolidification" literally means "the state of not being solid or the process of not becoming solid."
