词源:
The word "orgy" comes from the Ancient Greek word ὀργία (orgia), referring to the secret rites and ceremonies of the cult of Dionysus (Bacchus), the god of wine, fertility, and theatre.  These rites often involved ecstatic dancing, drinking, and revelry.  Over time, the word's meaning shifted to encompass any wild, unrestrained celebration or excessive indulgence.
