photodensitometer:/ˌfoʊtoʊdɛnˈsɪtɒmɪtər/ | n. |光密度计|An instrument used to measure the density of photographic images or other light-sensitive materials.  It measures the amount of light transmitted through or reflected from a material, which is related to its density.  |Example: The photodensitometer was used to analyze the density of the film negative. 光密度计被用来分析胶片的密度。|近义词：densitometer|反义词：None specifically, but instruments measuring the opposite (e.g., light transmission vs. absorption) could be considered contrastive.
