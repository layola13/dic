The word "predeceptions" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  However, we can analyze its potential meaning based on its component parts.

It appears to be formed from "pre-" (meaning before or in advance) and "deceptions" (the act of deceiving or misleading).  Therefore, a possible interpretation is "actions or statements intended to deceive *before* the main deception occurs."  This could refer to a preliminary or preparatory stage of a deceptive scheme.

To provide a response in the requested format, we will create a hypothetical entry based on this interpretation.  Remember this is speculative and not based on an existing word.
