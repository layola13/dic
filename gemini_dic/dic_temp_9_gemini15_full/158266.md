词源：

The phrase "play safe" combines the verb "play" (meaning to act in a particular way, here, in a cautious manner) and the adjective "safe" (meaning free from danger or risk).  The origin is idiomatic and doesn't trace back to a single etymological root but rather reflects the common sense usage of these words to create this phrase.
