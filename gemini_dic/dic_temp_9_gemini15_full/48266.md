decorrelated:/ˌdiːˈkɒrɪleɪtɪd/| adj.| 去相关的；去关联的 |Reduced or eliminated correlation between variables.  The process removes statistical dependencies between variables.  This is often done in data analysis to improve model accuracy or to isolate the effects of individual variables. | Example: The decorrelated data showed a clearer relationship between the independent and dependent variables.  去相关的數據顯示了自變量和因變量之間更清晰的關係。|近义词：uncorrelated, independent |反义词：correlated, dependent |


USAGE->
