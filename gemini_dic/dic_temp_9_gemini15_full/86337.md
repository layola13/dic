词源:
The word "heckle" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "heck," meaning "to catch, hook, or snare."  This likely refers to the way hecklers try to "catch" a speaker off guard or "snare" them with disruptive comments.  The verb evolved to specifically mean the noisy interruption of a speaker.
