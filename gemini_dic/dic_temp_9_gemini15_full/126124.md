mutex: /ˈmjuːtɛks/ | n. |互斥锁，互斥量 | A mutex (mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive that is used to protect shared resources from concurrent access by multiple threads or processes.  It ensures that only one thread or process can access the resource at any given time, preventing race conditions and data corruption.  A mutex is typically implemented as a lock that can be acquired and released. | Example:  In a multithreaded program, a mutex can be used to protect a shared counter from being incremented or decremented simultaneously by multiple threads, thus ensuring that the counter's value remains consistent.  The thread that acquires the mutex can access and modify the shared resource, and when finished, it releases the mutex, allowing other threads to acquire it. |近义词:semaphore, lock |反义词:None  |名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't conjugate like verbs.  Therefore, typical verb tenses are not applicable.  However, we can illustrate its usage in different sentence structures.

Simple Sentence:
The program uses a mutex to protect the shared data. = 该程序使用互斥锁来保护共享数据。

Complex Sentence:
Because multiple threads accessed the database simultaneously without a mutex, data corruption occurred. = 因为多个线程同时访问数据库而没有使用互斥锁，所以发生了数据损坏。


PHRASE->
mutex lock = 互斥锁
acquire a mutex = 获取互斥锁
release a mutex = 释放互斥锁
mutex variable = 互斥量变量
deadlock (related to mutexes) = 死锁 (与互斥锁相关)


词源:
The word "mutex" is a shortened form of "mutual exclusion," which accurately describes its function.  "Mutual" means shared or reciprocal, and "exclusion" means prevention of access.  Therefore, "mutual exclusion" signifies that only one process or thread can access a shared resource at a time, mutually excluding others.
