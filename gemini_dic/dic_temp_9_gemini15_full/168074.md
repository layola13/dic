词源:

The word "privileged" comes from the Old French word "privilegie," which in turn derives from the Late Latin word "privilegium."  "Privilegium" itself is a combination of "privus" (private) and "legis" (law).  Therefore, the original meaning implied a special law or right granted to an individual or group, setting them apart from the general populace.
