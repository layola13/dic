PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly involving "nonfeloniousnesses" due to its low frequency of use. The word itself is quite complex and rarely used in everyday conversation or writing.  Phrases would be built around the concept rather than the word itself.  For example:

"A lack of felonious intent" = 缺乏犯罪意图
"Minor infractions" = 轻微违规行为
"Civil offenses" = 民事侵权行为
"Non-criminal activity" = 非犯罪活动
"Acts of omission" = 疏忽行为


词源:

* **non-**:  Prefix meaning "not".
* **felonious**: Adjective derived from "felony," meaning a serious crime.  The root traces back to Old French "felonie" and ultimately to Latin "felonia" (treachery).
* **-ness**: Suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.  
* **-es**: Plural suffix for nouns.

Therefore, "nonfeloniousnesses" literally means "the state or quality of being not felonious," referring to multiple instances of such acts.
