The word "shapeliness" is derived from the adjective "shapely," which itself comes from the Old English word "scep," meaning "shape" or "form."  The suffix "-liness" adds the sense of "state of being" or "quality of."  Therefore, "shapeliness" literally means "the quality of having a pleasing or attractive shape."
