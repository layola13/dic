WORD ORIGIN->
The word "perplexiveness" is derived from the adjective "perplexed," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "perplexus," meaning "entangled" or "involved."  The suffix "-ive" transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality.  The final "-ness" suffix further reinforces this noun function, signifying the state of being perplexed.
