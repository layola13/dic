USAGE->
This word is primarily used in programming contexts and doesn't have typical grammatical tenses like "what" in the example.  Therefore, providing tenses like general present, past, etc. is not applicable.  Instead, examples of its usage will be provided in code snippets.

Example 1 (SQL):
SELECT * FROM users WHERE city IS NULL;  = 选择城市字段为空的用户。

Example 2 (Python):
my_variable = None  # Assigning a NULL value. = 将一个空值赋值给变量。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "nul" in the same way "what" forms many phrases in English.  The term is largely confined to its technical usage.
