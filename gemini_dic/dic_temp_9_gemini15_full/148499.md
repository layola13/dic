overstrongnesses:/ˌoʊvərˈstrɒŋnəsɪz/ | n. | 过强的方面；过分的优势 |  The word "overstrongnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a nonce word, meaning it's created for a specific occasion and not found in dictionaries. It appears to be formed by combining "over-" (meaning excessively) and "strongnesses" (a plural noun implying multiple strengths).  It suggests aspects or qualities that are excessively strong, perhaps to a detrimental degree.  There is no established usage or standard definition.
