USAGE->
This word is primarily used in literary analysis and discussions of prosody; therefore, typical grammatical tense examples are not applicable.  The word itself does not conjugate.  Instead, examples will focus on its use in describing poetic lines.

Example 1: The analysis of the poem revealed several hypermetrical lines, disrupting the expected iambic pentameter.  对这首诗的分析揭示了几行超长音节的诗句，破坏了预期的抑扬格五音步。

Example 2:  While adhering mostly to trochaic tetrameter, the song occasionally employed hypermetrical lines for emphasis.  虽然这首歌主要遵循的是抑步四音步，但偶尔也会使用超长音节的诗句来强调。
