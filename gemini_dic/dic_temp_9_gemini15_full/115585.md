词源：The word "marathon" comes from the Battle of Marathon in ancient Greece (490 BC).  According to legend, a soldier named Pheidippides ran from Marathon to Athens to announce the Greek victory, collapsing and dying after delivering the news.  This story, though possibly embellished, is the origin of the modern marathon race.  The distance of the modern marathon (26.2 miles) was standardized for the 1908 London Olympics.
