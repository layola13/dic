sinalbin: /sɪˈnæl.bɪn/ | n. | 白芥子碱 | A bitter-tasting compound found in white mustard seeds (Sinapis alba), consisting of a glucose-sulfate ester of sinapine and myronase enzyme.  It is a glucosinolate, and upon enzymatic hydrolysis, it yields glucose, sinapine sulfate, and potassium bisulfate. It has been studied for its potential biological activities, including antimicrobial and anticancer effects, though research is ongoing and not conclusive.  | 例句：The presence of sinalbin in white mustard seeds contributes to their characteristic pungent flavor. 白芥子种子中白芥子碱的存在赋予其独特的辛辣风味。

The hydrolysis of sinalbin produces glucose, sinapine sulfate, and potassium bisulfate.  白芥子碱的水解产物为葡萄糖、芥子碱硫酸盐和硫酸氢钾。 | 近义词：glucosinolate (broad category) | 反义词：N/A (no direct antonym) | 名词
