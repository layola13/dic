词源:

The word "hyper-personal" is a compound word.  "Hyper-" is a prefix derived from the Greek word "ὑπέρ" (hupér), meaning "over," "above," "beyond," or "excessively."  It indicates an intensification or exceeding of the base word. "Personal" comes from the Latin word "persona," meaning "mask," "character," or "person."  Therefore, "hyper-personal" signifies a degree of personalization that surpasses the usual or ordinary.
