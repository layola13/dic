incompossible: /ˌɪnˈkɒmpəsɪbl/ | adj. | 不可能的，不相容的 |  This word is a blend of "in-" (not) and "compossible" (capable of existing together). It describes something that is impossible or contradictory, suggesting that the constituent parts cannot coexist or be true simultaneously.  There is no established usage in standard English dictionaries; it's more of a neologism or a rare, informal coinage.  Since it's not a standard word, providing grammatical examples across tenses is not meaningful.
