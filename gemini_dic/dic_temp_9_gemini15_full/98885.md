The word "intergeneration" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There seems to be a misspelling.  It's likely you meant one of the following:


**1. Intergenerational:**

/ˌɪntərˌdʒɛnəˈreɪʃənəl/ | adj. | 世代间的，跨代的 | Relating to or involving several generations.  | Example:  The play explored intergenerational conflicts within a family. 这部戏剧探讨了一个家庭内部的几代人之间的冲突。 | 近义词：cross-generational | 反义词：intragenerational


**2. Integration:**

/ˌɪntɪˈɡreɪʃən/ | n. | 融合，整合 | The act or process of combining or uniting different things into a whole. | Example:  The integration of technology into education is transforming the learning experience. 技术融入教育正在改变学习体验。 | 近义词：unification, consolidation, amalgamation | 反义词：segregation, separation


**3. Generation:**

/ˌdʒɛnəˈreɪʃən/ | n. | 一代人，产生 | All of the people born and living at about the same time, regarded collectively. | Example:  My generation grew up with the internet. 我这一代是在互联网时代长大的。 | 近义词：cohort, age group | 反义词：无


Since the original word is likely a misspelling,  I will provide usage examples for "Intergenerational" and "Integration" as they are the most probable intended words.  "Generation" is a single word and doesn't require extensive usage examples as requested.
