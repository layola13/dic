英文解析:
The word "ill-mannerednesses" is the plural form of "ill-manneredness," which refers to instances of bad manners or impolite behavior.  It denotes a collection of rude or uncivil actions or attitudes.  The "ill-" prefix indicates a negative quality, while "manneredness" relates to behavior and etiquette.


例句:

The children's ill-mannerednesses were a constant source of embarrassment for their parents. 孩子们的无礼行为一直让他们的父母感到尴尬。


词源:

* **ill-**:  Prefix meaning "bad," "evil," or "not."  Derived from Old English *yfel*.

* **manneredness**:  Noun form of "mannered," related to "manner," meaning "way of behaving or acting."  Derived from Old French *maniere*, ultimately from Latin *manus* ("hand").  The "-ness" suffix creates a noun indicating a state or quality.

因此，“ill-mannerednesses”这个词是通过将表示“坏的”或“不好的”前缀“ill-”添加到表示行为方式的名词“manneredness”中，并加上复数后缀“-es”而形成的。
