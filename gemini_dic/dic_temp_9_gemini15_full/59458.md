词源：The term "earworm" is a relatively recent coinage, a blend of "ear" and "worm," reflecting the sensation of a persistent melody burrowing into one's mind.  The German term "Ohrwurm" (literally "earworm") predates the English term and likely influenced its creation.  The imagery evokes the persistent, intrusive nature of the musical phrase.
