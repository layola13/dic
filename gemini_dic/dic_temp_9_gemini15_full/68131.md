fahlband: /ˈfɑːlˌbænd/ | n. |暗色带，暗色条带 | A fahlband is a laterally extensive, thin, dark-colored sedimentary rock layer, often found within otherwise lighter-colored strata.  These layers are typically enriched in heavy minerals and fine-grained materials, and their formation is often linked to changes in depositional environments or paleocurrents. They are commonly studied in stratigraphy and sedimentology to understand past environmental conditions. | 例句：The geologist identified a fahlband within the sandstone sequence, indicating a change in the depositional environment. 地质学家在砂岩层序中识别出一个暗色带，表明沉积环境发生了变化。


The presence of a fahlband in this outcrop suggests a period of increased sediment influx from a different source.  这个露头上暗色带的存在表明一段时期内来自不同来源的沉积物大量涌入。| 近义词：dark band, shale band, thin layer | 反义词：light band, bright layer | 名词
