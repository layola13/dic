近义词：apparently miraculously, seemingly miraculously, deceptively miraculous

反义词：genuinely miraculously, truly miraculously


词性：形容词


词源：

* **pseudo-**:  from Greek *pseudos* meaning "false," "sham," or "pretended."
* **miraculously**: from "miracle," ultimately from Latin *miraculum*, a diminutive of *mirus*, meaning "wonderful," "amazing."
* **-ly**: adverbial suffix, forming adverbs from adjectives.

Therefore, "pseudomiraculously" combines the sense of "false" or "apparent" with "miraculous," creating a word that describes something appearing to be a miracle but lacking genuine miraculous qualities.
