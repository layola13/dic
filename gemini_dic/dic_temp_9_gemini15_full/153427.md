词源:
The word "penn" has its origins in the Old English word "penning," meaning "a small coin."  This, in turn, derives from the Proto-Germanic word "*penniz," which also meant "a small coin." The connection to the writing instrument comes later, as metal pens were sometimes called "pens" in reference to their resemblance to a penny. The word's development reflects the historical significance of coins as a unit of currency.
