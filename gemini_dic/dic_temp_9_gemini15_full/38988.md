词源：
Comes from the Old French *confirmacion*, from the Latin *confirmatio*, from *confirmare* "to strengthen, make firm," from *com-* "together" + *firmare* "to make firm," from *firmus* "firm, strong."  The meaning evolved from the strengthening of something to the act of verifying its truth or existence.
