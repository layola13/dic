词源:

The word "nonimputativeness" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), the noun "imputativeness" (meaning "the act or instance of imputing; attribution of blame or fault"), which in turn is derived from the verb "impute" (to attribute or ascribe).  Therefore, "nonimputativeness" literally means "not imputing," or the absence of assigning blame.
