词源:

The word "docibleness" is derived from the Latin word "docilis," meaning "teachable," "easily taught," or "tractable."  The suffix "-ness" is added to transform the adjective "docile" into a noun, indicating a quality or state.


用法说明:


docibleness is a noun referring to the quality of being docile, meaning easily managed or handled; readily trained or taught; submissive.  It implies a willingness to learn and follow instructions without resistance.  The word is often used to describe animals, children, or people who are easily led or controlled.  It carries a slightly positive connotation, emphasizing the ease of instruction rather than any inherent lack of will.  However, excessive docibleness can also be interpreted as a lack of assertiveness or independent thinking.
