The word "by's" does not exist as a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a non-standard usage.  There is no phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, or dictionary definition for it.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.

To help, I can offer possible interpretations depending on what the intended word might have been:


**Possibility 1:  Typo for "bye's" (plural of "bye")**

/baɪz/ | n. | 再见 (复数) |  The plural form of "bye," used informally to express farewell to multiple people. | Example:  She waved and shouted "Bye's!" to her friends. 她挥手并向她的朋友们喊道“再见！” | Near Synonyms:  goodbyes, farewells | Antonyms:  (None directly applicable) | Noun


**Possibility 2:  Typo for "by's" (possessive of "by")**

/baɪz/ | pron. |  by's (属格) |  The possessive form of the preposition "by," although extremely uncommon and generally grammatically incorrect.
