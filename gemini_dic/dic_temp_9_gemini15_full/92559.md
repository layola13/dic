词源:
The word "hysteric" ultimately derives from the Greek word "hystera," meaning "womb."  Ancient Greek physicians attributed many women's emotional disturbances to problems with their uterus. This understanding, though now completely discredited, is the origin of the word's association with uncontrolled female emotion.  Over time, the term evolved to describe uncontrolled emotional outbursts in both men and women.
