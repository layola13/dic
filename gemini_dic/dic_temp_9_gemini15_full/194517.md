词源:
The word "self-scorn" is a compound word.  "Self" is a prefix meaning "of or relating to oneself," and "scorn" is a noun meaning "a feeling or expression of contempt or derision."  Therefore, self-scorn literally means "contempt or derision for oneself."  The word's origins lie in the Old English word "scornan," meaning "to scorn, despise."
