The word "mappist" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical explanation cannot be provided.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very niche context.

If you have encountered this word somewhere, please provide the context (sentence, paragraph, source) so that I can try to understand its intended meaning and offer a possible analysis based on that context.
