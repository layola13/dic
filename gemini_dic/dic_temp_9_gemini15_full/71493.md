词源：源自法语单词“flâner”，意思是“闲逛”、“漫步”。  This term, in turn, is possibly related to the Old French "flaner," meaning "to loiter" or "to idle."  The concept and word gained popularity in 19th-century France, associated with the philosophy of Baudelaire and other writers who described the experience of urban wandering.
