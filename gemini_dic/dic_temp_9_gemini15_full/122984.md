The word "monamore" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specific context (e.g., a fictional language).  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a response, I need more context on where you encountered this word.


If you can provide the source where you saw "monamore," I may be able to offer a more informed guess at its meaning and possible etymology.
