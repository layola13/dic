词源:

The word "far-reachingness" is derived from the adjective "far-reaching," which combines "far" (meaning distant or extensive) and "reaching" (referring to extent or influence).  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being far-reaching.  Therefore, it literally means "the quality or state of having a wide or extensive effect".
