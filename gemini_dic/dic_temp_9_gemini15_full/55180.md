词源:
The word "dissent" comes from the Old French word "dissentir," meaning "to disagree." This, in turn, comes from the Latin word "dissentire," which is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart" or "away") and "sentire" (meaning "to feel" or "to think").  Therefore, "dissent" literally means "to think differently" or "to feel differently."
