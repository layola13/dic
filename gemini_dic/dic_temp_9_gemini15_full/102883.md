词源:
The word "javel" comes from the Old French word "javelot," meaning "a javelin" or a small spear.  The connection lies in the fact that the early forms of bleach were sometimes applied with a pointed instrument, resembling a javelin. Over time, the word shifted in meaning to refer specifically to a bleaching agent.  Note that this etymology is not a direct semantic evolution; rather it's a case of the word's meaning evolving through association.
