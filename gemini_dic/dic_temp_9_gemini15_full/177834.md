词源:
The word "recentralize" is formed by the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") + "centralize."  "Centralize" comes from the word "central," ultimately derived from the Latin word "centrum," meaning "center." Therefore, "recentralize" literally means "to centralize again" or "to bring back to the center."
