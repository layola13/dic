PHRASE->

There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "quasi-fatalistically."  The word itself is relatively uncommon and used more in formal writing to describe a nuanced attitude.  Phrases would need to be constructed around it, rather than existing as pre-made units.  Examples could include:

词源:

The word is a combination of:

* **quasi-**:  Latin prefix meaning "as if," "seemingly," or "almost."
* **fatalistically**:  From "fatalism" (belief that all events are predetermined and inevitable) + "-istically" (adverbial suffix).  "Fatalism" itself derives from "fatal" (relating to fate) from Latin "fatalis."
