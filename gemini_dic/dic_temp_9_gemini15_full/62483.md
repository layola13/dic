endospore:/ˈɛndoʊspɔːr/| n. |内生孢子|A dormant, tough, and non-reproductive structure produced by some bacteria in response to unfavorable environmental conditions.  It is highly resistant to heat, radiation, drying, and many chemicals.  The endospore can survive for extended periods until conditions become favorable again, at which point it germinates and forms a new vegetative cell.|Example:  Bacillus and Clostridium species are known to form endospores.|近义词：spore (a more general term)|反义词：vegetative cell (the actively growing form of the bacterium)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The bacteria forms endospores under stress. = 细菌在压力下形成内生孢子。
Endospores protect the bacteria from harsh conditions. = 内生孢子保护细菌免受恶劣环境的影响。

一般过去时:
The scientist observed endospore formation in the lab. = 科学家在实验室里观察到内生孢子的形成。
The endospore survived extreme temperatures. = 内生孢子经受住了极端温度的考验。

现在完成时:
Scientists have studied endospores for decades. = 科学家们已经研究内生孢子几十年了。
The bacterial population has produced many endospores. = 细菌种群已经产生了大量的内生孢子。


过去完成时:
The endospore had already germinated before the analysis began. = 在分析开始之前，内生孢子已经萌发了。
The bacteria had formed endospores in anticipation of the drought. = 细菌已经形成内生孢子以应对干旱。


将来时:
The research will examine the role of endospores in disease transmission. = 该研究将检查内生孢子在疾病传播中的作用。
The endospores will likely survive the sterilization process. = 内生孢子很可能会在消毒过程中存活下来。


虚拟语气:
If the temperature were higher, the endospores would not survive. = 如果温度更高，内生孢子将无法存活。

被动语态:
Endospores are used in some sterilization studies. = 内生孢子被用于一些消毒研究。
The endospores were destroyed by the high pressure. = 内生孢子被高压破坏了。


疑问句:
What triggers endospore formation? = 什么会触发内生孢子的形成？
How long can endospores remain dormant? = 内生孢子可以休眠多久？


否定句:
The bacteria did not produce endospores under optimal conditions. = 在最佳条件下，细菌没有产生内生孢子。
This method does not effectively kill endospores. = 此方法不能有效杀死内生孢子。


PHRASE->
endospore formation = 内生孢子形成
endospore germination = 内生孢子萌发
endospore resistance = 内生孢子抗性
heat-resistant endospores = 耐热内生孢子
endospore stain = 内生孢子染色
