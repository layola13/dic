词源:
The word "serenader" comes from the word "serenade," which comes from the Italian word "serenata," meaning "evening song."  The suffix "-er" denotes a person who performs the action.  Ultimately, it is related to the Latin word "serēnus," meaning "calm," "clear," or "tranquil," reflecting the peaceful and often nighttime nature of a serenade.
