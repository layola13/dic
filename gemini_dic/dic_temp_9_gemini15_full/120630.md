词源:
The word "mis-coordinated" is formed by the prefix "mis-" (meaning wrongly or badly) and the adjective "coordinated" (meaning well-organized and working together harmoniously).  "Coordinated" comes from the verb "coordinate," which itself originates from the Latin words "co-" (together) and "ordinatus" (ordered or arranged).
