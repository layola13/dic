词源:
The word "inhauler" is a relatively recent coinage, likely formed by combining the prefix "in-" (meaning "into") and "hauler," which originally referred to something that hauls or pulls.  In the context of medicine, "hauler" is used metaphorically to describe the device that "hauls" or draws medication into the lungs.  While there's no definitive historical record tracing its etymology, its structure clearly points towards its functional description.
