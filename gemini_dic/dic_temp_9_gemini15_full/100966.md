The word "inustion" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established meaning, pronunciation, etymology, or usage.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a technical term from a very specialized field, or a word from a fictional language.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis.
