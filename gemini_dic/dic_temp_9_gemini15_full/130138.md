non-reducing: /ˌnɒn rɪˈdʒuːsɪŋ/ | adj. |非还原性的；不发生还原反应的 |  Describing a sugar or other substance that does not undergo reduction reactions, particularly in the context of chemical reactions involving the carbonyl group (C=O).  In simpler terms, it refers to a type of sugar that cannot be easily oxidized because its anomeric carbon is already involved in a glycosidic bond. | Example: Sucrose is a non-reducing sugar because its anomeric carbons are involved in a glycosidic linkage, preventing them from participating in reduction reactions.  蔗糖是一种非还原性糖，因为它的异头碳参与了糖苷键的形成，阻止了它参与还原反应。 | 近义词: non-reactive (in this specific context) | 反义词: reducing


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The solution remains non-reducing. = 溶液保持非还原性。
This sugar is non-reducing. = 这种糖是非还原性的。

一般过去时:
The sample was non-reducing after the reaction. = 反应后样品是非还原性的。
The test showed the substance was non-reducing. = 测试表明该物质是非还原性的。


现在完成时:
The scientists have confirmed that the compound is non-reducing. = 科学家们已经证实该化合物是非还原性的。
We have determined that the sugar is non-reducing in nature. = 我们已经确定该糖本质上是非还原性的。


过去完成时:
The researchers had found that the previous sample was non-reducing. = 研究人员发现之前的样品是非还原性的。
It had been established that the substance was non-reducing. = 已经确定该物质是非还原性的。


将来时:
The experiment will demonstrate that the product will be non-reducing. = 实验将证明该产物将是非还原性的。
The analysis will show the material to be non-reducing. = 分析将显示该材料是非还原性的。


虚拟语气:
If the sugar were non-reducing, it would not react with Benedict's solution. = 如果糖是非还原性的，它就不会与本尼迪特试剂反应。
If the substance had been non-reducing, different results would have been observed. = 如果物质是非还原性的，就会观察到不同的结果。


被动语态:
The non-reducing nature of the substance was confirmed by the test. = 该物质的非还原性通过测试得到证实。
The sugar is considered to be non-reducing. = 该糖被认为是非还原性的。


疑问句:
Is this sugar reducing or non-reducing? = 这种糖是还原性的还是非还原性的？
Are all disaccharides non-reducing? = 所有二糖都是非还原性的吗？


否定句:
The sugar is not non-reducing; it is a reducing sugar. = 该糖不是非还原性的；它是还原性糖。
The compound is not classified as non-reducing. = 该化合物不被归类为非还原性。


PHRASE->
