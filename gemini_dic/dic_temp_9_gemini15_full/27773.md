词源:

The word "cannibalises" derives from "cannibal," which itself comes from the Spanish word "caníbal," ultimately originating from the Carib people, an indigenous group from the Caribbean islands.  The Carib were known for their practice of cannibalism, hence the association.  The "-ise" suffix transforms the noun into a verb, indicating the act of consuming or destroying something in a similar way to cannibalism.
