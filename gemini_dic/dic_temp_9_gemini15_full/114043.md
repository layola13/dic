magnetic-inclination: /ˌmæɡˈnɛtɪk ɪnklɪˈneɪʃən/ | n. | 磁倾角 | The angle between the Earth's magnetic field lines and the horizontal plane.  It varies with location and time.  This angle is also known as magnetic dip. | Example:  The magnetic inclination is measured using a dip needle. 磁倾角是用倾角仪测量的。  The high magnetic inclination in this region affects compass readings.  该区域的高磁倾角会影响指南针的读数。 | 近义词: magnetic dip | 反义词:  (None directly opposite, but a value of 0° would indicate no inclination) |  词性: noun
