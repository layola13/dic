/ˌseɪˈtænɪkəlˌnɛsɪz/ | n. | 魔性；邪恶的本性；撒旦般的行为 | The satanicalnesses of the cult leader were finally exposed. | 近义词：devilishness, wickedness, evil | 反义词：holiness, goodness, piety


英文解析:  Satanicalnesses is a rare and somewhat awkward word. It refers to the multiple instances or aspects of satanical behavior, characteristics, or influence. It suggests a multitude of evil actions or qualities associated with Satan or evil spirits.  The word is formed by adding the plural suffix "-nesses" to the adjective "satanical," intensifying the sense of evil.


例句:

The numerous satanicalnesses uncovered during the investigation shocked the public.  = 调查中发现的诸多邪恶行径震惊了公众。


The book detailed the satanicalnesses of the ancient rituals. = 这本书详细描述了古代仪式中的邪恶行径。


词源:  Derived from "Satan" (a proper noun referring to the adversary in Abrahamic religions) + "ical" (forming an adjective) + "-ness" (a suffix forming a noun of quality or state) + "-es" (plural suffix).


用法说明:

由于其生涩罕见，在正式写作中应尽量避免使用"satanicalnesses"。  更简洁明了的词语，如"evil acts," "wicked deeds," or "demonic influences," 通常更适合表达类似含义。  这个词主要用于强调邪恶行为的多种性和复杂性。
