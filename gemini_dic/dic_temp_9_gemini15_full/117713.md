词源:

The word "melancholics" derives from the noun "melancholia," which traces back to the Greek words "melan" (μέλας) meaning "black" and "chole" (χολή) meaning "bile." In ancient Greek humoral theory, melancholia was believed to be caused by an excess of black bile.  The suffix "-ics" denotes those affected by or associated with the condition.
