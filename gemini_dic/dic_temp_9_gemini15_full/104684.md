karvel:/ˈkɑːrvəl/| n.| 克尔维尔式船体；龙骨船体 | A type of ship construction where the planks are fastened edge to edge, without any overlapping, and caulked to make the hull watertight. This method was common in early shipbuilding, particularly in the Mediterranean.  | The ancient Greeks and Romans built many ships with karvel construction. | 近义词：plank-on-plank (though not a perfect synonym as karvel implies specific caulking)| 反义词：clinker-built (overlapping planks)
