nephridium:/nɪˈfrɪdiəm/| n. |肾脏；排泄器官| An excretory organ in many invertebrates, especially annelids and molluscs, that filters waste products from the blood.  Nephridia are analogous to the kidneys in vertebrates, removing metabolic waste and maintaining osmotic balance.| Example: The earthworm's nephridia are responsible for filtering waste from its blood.|近义词: kidney (in vertebrates), excretory organ|反义词: N/A
