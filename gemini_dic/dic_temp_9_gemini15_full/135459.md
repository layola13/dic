USAGE->
This word is extremely rare and doesn't have common usage examples across different tenses.  The word itself is formed by adding a pluralizing suffix to "nonpervasiveness," which is already a relatively uncommon word.  Therefore, providing examples across various tenses would be artificial and unhelpful.  The usage is limited to academic or highly specialized contexts.


PHRASE->
No common phrases exist using "nonpervasivenesses."  The word itself is too specialized for common phrasal usage.
