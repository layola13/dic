词源:
The word "overmagnetic" is a compound word formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much") with the adjective "magnetic" (relating to magnetism).  Therefore, its etymology traces back to the Greek word "magnētis" (μαγνήτης), meaning "magnet stone," from Magnesia, a region in ancient Greece known for its magnetic iron ore.
