interactor:/ˈɪntəræktər/| n. |相互作用物；交互器| A molecule or other entity that interacts with another molecule or entity.  It often refers to a protein that interacts with another protein or a DNA sequence.  |例句：The researchers identified a novel interactor of the tumor suppressor protein p53. 研究人员鉴定了一种新的肿瘤抑制蛋白p53的相互作用物。

例句：This software acts as an interactor between the user and the database. 这个软件充当用户和数据库之间的交互器。


近义词：interacting molecule, interacting protein, binding partner|反义词：non-interactor|词性：名词

词源:
The word "interactor" is derived from the verb "interact," which combines the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") with the verb "act" (meaning "to do" or "to perform").  Therefore, "interactor" literally means something that acts between or among other things. The suffix "-or" indicates an agent or doer of the action.
