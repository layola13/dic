quasi-physical: /ˈkwɑːzaɪ ˈfɪzɪkəl/ | adj. | 准物理的，似物理的 |  Appearing to be or having characteristics of physical phenomena, but not entirely or strictly so.  It often refers to something that has some physical aspects but also involves abstract or theoretical concepts.  |  The simulation created a quasi-physical environment where users could interact with virtual objects.  模拟创造了一个准物理环境，用户可以在其中与虚拟物体互动。 The model uses a quasi-physical approach to represent the complex interactions between molecules. 该模型采用准物理方法来表示分子之间复杂的相互作用。 |近义词：semipysical, virtual, apparent | 反义词：purely physical, entirely abstract


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The simulation displays quasi-physical properties. = 模拟显示准物理特性。
This model employs a quasi-physical approach. = 此模型采用准物理方法。


一般过去时:
The experiment demonstrated quasi-physical effects. = 实验展示了准物理效应。
Scientists observed quasi-physical phenomena. = 科学家观察到了准物理现象。


现在完成时:
Researchers have developed a quasi-physical model. = 研究人员已经开发了一个准物理模型。
The study has shown quasi-physical interactions. = 该研究显示了准物理相互作用。


过去完成时:
They had already implemented a quasi-physical system. = 他们已经实现了一个准物理系统。
The team had observed similar quasi-physical behaviors before. = 该团队之前已经观察到类似的准物理行为。


将来时:
We will use a quasi-physical approach in the next experiment. = 我们将在下一次实验中使用准物理方法。
They will analyze the quasi-physical properties of the material. = 他们将分析该材料的准物理特性。


虚拟语气:
If it were a purely physical phenomenon, we wouldn't see these effects. = 如果它是一种纯粹的物理现象，我们就不会看到这些效应。
It's as if the system were exhibiting quasi-physical behavior. = 它就像系统正在表现出准物理行为一样。


被动语态:
Quasi-physical effects were observed in the experiment. = 在实验中观察到准物理效应。
A quasi-physical model is being developed for this application. = 正在为该应用开发一个准物理模型。


疑问句:
Are these effects purely physical or quasi-physical? = 这些效应是纯粹的物理效应还是准物理效应？
Is the model based on a quasi-physical representation? = 该模型是基于准物理表示的吗？


否定句:
The system does not exhibit purely physical behavior; it's quasi-physical. = 该系统没有表现出纯粹的物理行为；它是准物理的。
This phenomenon is not entirely physical; it has quasi-physical aspects. = 这种现象并非完全是物理的；它具有准物理方面。


PHRASE->
quasi-physical model 准物理模型
quasi-physical simulation 准物理模拟
quasi-physical interaction 准物理相互作用
quasi-physical properties 准物理特性
quasi-physical environment 准物理环境


词源:

The word "quasi" comes from the Latin word "quasi," meaning "as if," "almost," or "similar to."  "Physical" comes from the Greek word "physikos," meaning "natural," "relating to nature," or "pertaining to physics."  Therefore, "quasi-physical" describes something that resembles physical phenomena but isn't strictly or entirely so.
