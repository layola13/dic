词源:
The word "dowse" comes from the Middle English word *dowsen*, meaning "to dip" or "to plunge."  This likely refers to the dipping motion of the divining rod used in the practice of dowsing.  The connection is somewhat indirect, as the original meaning is not directly related to the modern practice, but the action of dipping the rod gave rise to the modern association.
