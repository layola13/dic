purposivism: /ˈpɜːrpəsɪvɪzəm/ | n. | 目的论；目的论哲学 |

英文解析：Purposivism is a philosophical perspective that emphasizes the importance of purpose, intention, or goal-directedness in explaining phenomena, especially in areas such as ethics, biology, and social sciences. It contrasts with purely mechanistic or deterministic views.  It suggests that things exist or happen because of a purpose or intention, rather than purely due to chance or external forces.  Different forms of purposivism exist, varying in their accounts of how purposes operate and what kind of entities can have them.
