silicatization:/ˌsɪlɪsɪˈzeɪʃən/| n. |硅化作用；硅化；硅质化 |The process by which silica is deposited in or replaces organic matter, resulting in the formation of siliceous rocks or fossils.  This process often occurs in sedimentary rocks and can preserve delicate structures. |例句：The silicatization of the wood resulted in the formation of a petrified log.  硅化作用使木材形成了一个化石原木。

The extensive silicatization of the fossils made them incredibly well-preserved.  化石的大量硅化作用使它们保存得非常好。|近义词：petrification,silicification|反义词：decomposition, decay


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Silicatization occurs in many geological settings. = 硅化作用发生在许多地质环境中。
The process of silicatization transforms organic matter. = 硅化作用改变了有机质。


一般过去时:
Silicatization of the wood preserved its detailed structure. = 木材的硅化作用保存了其精细的结构。
The researchers studied the silicatization in the ancient rocks. = 研究人员研究了古代岩石中的硅化作用。


现在完成时:
Silicatization has significantly altered the rock's composition. = 硅化作用已经显著改变了岩石的成分。

疑问句:
What factors influence the rate of silicatization? = 哪些因素影响硅化作用的速度？
How does silicatization affect the preservation of fossils? = 硅化作用如何影响化石的保存？


否定句:
Silicatization did not occur uniformly throughout the sample. = 硅化作用在整个样品中并非均匀发生。
The researchers did not find evidence of significant silicatization. = 研究人员没有发现明显的硅化作用证据。
