poikilothermal:/ˌpɔɪkɪləˈθɜːrməl/| adj.| 变温的；冷血的 | An organism whose internal temperature varies considerably depending on the ambient environmental temperature.  Poikilothermic animals, unlike homeothermic animals, cannot regulate their body temperature internally and rely on external sources of heat or behavioral adaptations to maintain a suitable temperature.  | 例句：Lizards are poikilothermal animals, meaning their body temperature fluctuates with the surrounding environment.  蜥蜴是变温动物，这意味着它们的体温随周围环境而变化。

Many reptiles are poikilothermal and bask in the sun to raise their body temperature. 许多爬行动物是变温动物，它们晒太阳来提高体温。| 近义词：cold-blooded, ectothermic | 反义词：homeothermic, warm-blooded


Etymology:

The word "poikilothermal" is derived from the Greek words:

* **poikilos (ποικίλος):** meaning "varied," "diverse," or "mottled."
* **thermos (θερμός):** meaning "heat" or "warm."


Therefore, "poikilothermal" literally means "having varied heat" or "having variable temperature."  The "-al" suffix indicates an adjective.
