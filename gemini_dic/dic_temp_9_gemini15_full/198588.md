The word "shuckses" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a particular dialect or context.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need clarification on the intended word or context in which you encountered "shuckses."
