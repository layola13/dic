词源:
The word "depressed" comes from the past participle of the verb "depress," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "deprimere," meaning "to press down," "to lower," or "to subdue."  The sense of emotional low spirits developed from the more literal meaning of pressing down or being weighed down.
