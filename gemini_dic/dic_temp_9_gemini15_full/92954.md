词源:  From "ideology" + "-ally".  "Ideology" itself comes from the French word "idéologie," coined by Destutt de Tracy in the late 18th century, combining "idée" (idea) and "-logie" (the study of).  It initially referred to the science of ideas, but later acquired its current meaning of a system of ideas and ideals, especially one that forms the basis of economic or political theory and policy.


用法说明:

The adverb "ideologically" modifies verbs, adjectives, or entire clauses to indicate that something is influenced by or consistent with a particular ideology.  It emphasizes the role of ideology in shaping actions, beliefs, or systems.  The word often appears in academic or political discourse to analyze the underlying motivations and beliefs driving events or decisions.
