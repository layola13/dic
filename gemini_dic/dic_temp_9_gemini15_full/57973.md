词源:
The word "drive" originates from the Old English word "drīfan," meaning "to push," "to thrust," or "to force."  This root connects it to other Germanic words with similar meanings.  The modern English word reflects a gradual expansion of its meaning, from physical pushing to the metaphorical driving of a vehicle or a force, such as ambition.
