词源:  The word is a compound adjective.  "Mouth" refers to the mouth, and "watering" describes the salivary response to appealing food. The phrase evokes the physiological reaction of increased saliva production when anticipating or experiencing delicious food.  The term likely emerged in the late 19th or early 20th century as a descriptive, evocative phrase.  Its formation follows a common pattern in English of using vivid imagery to describe sensory experiences.
