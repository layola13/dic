词源:
The word "harmonizer" comes from the word "harmony," which itself has roots in the Ancient Greek word "harmonia" (ἁρμονία), meaning "agreement," "joint," or "fitting together." The suffix "-izer" indicates something that causes or produces the action.  Therefore, a harmonizer is something that creates or establishes harmony.
