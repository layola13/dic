plasticize:/ˈplæstɪsaɪz/| vt.| 使塑化；增塑；使柔韧 | To make (a substance, especially a plastic) softer and more pliable by adding a plasticizer.  |例句：The manufacturer plasticizes the vinyl to improve its flexibility. 制造商对乙烯基进行塑化处理以提高其柔韧性。

例句：Adding a plasticizer plasticizes the polymer, making it less brittle. 添加增塑剂使聚合物塑化，使其不那么脆。


近义词：soften, flexibilize |反义词：harden, stiffen


词源:  From "plastic" + "-ize" (suffix forming verbs).  The word "plastic" itself originates from the Greek word "plastikos," meaning "capable of being molded."  The "-ize" suffix is of Greek origin as well, indicating "to make" or "to become."
