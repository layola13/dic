isogonic:/ˌaɪsoʊˈɡɒnɪk/| adj.|等磁偏角线的；等磁偏角的|Of or relating to lines on a map connecting points of equal magnetic declination (the angle between magnetic north and true north).  Isogonic lines are used in navigation and surveying to correct for the variation in the Earth's magnetic field.| Example: The ship's navigator consulted the isogonic chart to determine the magnetic declination at their current location.  The isogonic lines on the map showed a significant variation in magnetic declination across the region.|近义词：isogonal (in a different context)|反义词：None specifically, but the opposite concept would be lines of unequal magnetic declination.


USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective and doesn't have verb conjugations like "What" in the example.  It describes a characteristic of lines, not an action.  Therefore, tense and voice conjugations are not applicable.


PHRASE->
Isogonic lines, isogonic chart, isogonic map, magnetic declination, variation in magnetic declination
