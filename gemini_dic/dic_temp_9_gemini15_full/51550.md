The word "deurmekaar" is not an English word.  It is Afrikaans.  Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis following the requested English word analysis format.  The format is designed for English words.  To analyze "deurmekaar", I would need to use an Afrikaans-specific format.  If you would like me to analyze it in that context, please let me know, and I will do my best to provide information on its pronunciation, meaning, usage, etymology, and any relevant grammatical information within the framework of the Afrikaans language.
