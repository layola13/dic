The word "prepractise" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism (newly coined word), possibly a misspelling or an attempt to create a word meaning "to practice beforehand" or "to pre-practice."  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, let's analyze what the intended word *might* be and how it could be used:


If "prepractise" was intended to mean "to practice beforehand," the correct word would likely be **"rehearse"** or **"practice"** with an appropriate adverbial modifier.

**rehearse:** /rɪˈhɜːrs/ | v. | 排练，预演 | To practice (a play, piece of music, etc.) in preparation for a public performance. | Example: The actors rehearsed the play for several weeks before the opening night.  演员们在开幕前排练了几个星期。| Near synonyms: practice, prepare, drill | Antonyms: improvise, wing it


**practice (with adverb):** /ˈpræktɪs/ | v. | 练习，实践 | To perform repeatedly in order to acquire skill or proficiency. | Example:  The musician practiced diligently every day. 音乐家每天勤奋练习。  The team pre-practice their strategies.  团队预先练习他们的策略。| Near synonyms: rehearse, drill, train | Antonyms: neglect, ignore
