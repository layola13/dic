词源:  The verb "cosy up" combines the adjective "cosy" (meaning comfortable and warm) with the phrasal verb "up," which often indicates an intensification or completion of an action.  The overall meaning thus suggests a movement towards intimacy and warmth.  "Cosy" itself originates from the Dutch word "koosij,"  meaning "soft" or "comfortable".
