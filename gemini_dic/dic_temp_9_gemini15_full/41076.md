词源:

The word "coppering" derives directly from the noun "copper," referring to the metallic element. The use of copper as a coating material gave rise to the verb "to copper," meaning to cover with copper. The secondary meaning of bribery or shielding likely emerged metaphorically,  referring to the idea of covering up or protecting something (or someone) like a copper coating protects metal.
