exciton:/ˈɛksɪtɑːn/| n. |激子|An exciton is a quasiparticle that exists in insulators, semiconductors, and some liquids.  It's a bound state of an electron and an electron hole, which are created when a photon excites an electron to a higher energy level, leaving behind a "hole" where the electron was. The electron and hole are attracted to each other by the Coulomb force but remain bound together, and move through the material as a single unit. Excitons play a crucial role in various optical and electronic processes in materials. |Example: The absorption of light by a semiconductor often involves the creation of excitons.  激子在半导体的发光吸收过程中起着至关重要的作用。|近义词:quasiparticle |反义词:N/A
