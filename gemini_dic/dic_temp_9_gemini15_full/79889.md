gnathopodite:/ˈnæθəpədaɪt/| n. |颚足|A gnathopodite is a type of appendage found in some arthropods, particularly crustaceans.  It's a modified limb that is used for feeding, and is typically located near the mouth. The structure and function can vary depending on the species.  It often has sensory functions in addition to feeding. |The isopod's gnathopod was adapted for grasping and manipulating food. | 近义词：mandibular appendage (in some contexts) | 反义词：无 |

一般现在时:
The crab uses its gnathopods to grasp its prey. = 螃蟹用它的颚足抓住猎物。
The isopod's gnathopods are used for feeding and sensing. = 等足类的颚足用于摄食和感知。

一般过去时:
The scientist observed the gnathopod's movement during feeding. = 科学家观察了颚足在进食过程中的运动。
The damaged gnathopod hindered the shrimp's ability to eat. = 受损的颚足妨碍了虾的进食能力。

现在完成时:

过去完成时:
Before the attack, the amphipod had already lost one of its gnathopods. = 在袭击之前，端足类动物已经失去了一只颚足。
The crab had used its gnathopods to secure its meal before I arrived. = 我到达之前，螃蟹已经用它的颚足固定住了它的食物。

将来时:
Scientists will study the gnathopods of this new species. = 科学家将研究这个新物种的颚足。

虚拟语气:
If the gnathopod were stronger, the crustacean could crush larger prey. = 如果颚足更强壮，甲壳类动物就能压碎更大的猎物。
I wish I had a better understanding of the gnathopod's sensory functions. = 我希望我对颚足的感觉功能有更好的理解。

被动语态:
The gnathopod's structure was carefully examined under a microscope. = 颚足的结构在显微镜下被仔细检查。
The function of the gnathopod is being investigated by researchers. = 颚足的功能正在由研究人员进行调查。

疑问句:
What is the primary function of the gnathopod in this species? = 在这个物种中，颚足的主要功能是什么？
How are the gnathopods of different crustacean species adapted to their environments? = 不同甲壳类动物的颚足是如何适应其环境的？

否定句:
The damaged gnathopod did not allow the amphipod to feed effectively. = 受损的颚足不允许端足类动物有效地进食。
This species of crustacean does not have well-developed gnathopods. = 这种甲壳类动物没有发育良好的颚足。


PHRASE->
gnathopod morphology = 颚足形态
