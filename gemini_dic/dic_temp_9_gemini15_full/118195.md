词源:
The word "mentorships" is derived from the noun "mentor," which ultimately originates from Homer's Odyssey. In the epic poem, Mentor was an old friend and trusted advisor to Telemachus, Odysseus' son.  Over time, "mentor" came to be used to describe anyone who provides guidance and support to a less experienced person. The suffix "-ship" is added to create the noun "mentorship," indicating the state or condition of being a mentor or the relationship between a mentor and mentee.  The plural form is "mentorships".
