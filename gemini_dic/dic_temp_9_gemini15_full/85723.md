hawala:/hɑːˈwɑːlə/| n. |哈瓦拉,非正式资金转移系统|A hawala is an informal value transfer system based on trust and the honor system. It's used to transfer money across borders, often in places with underdeveloped or unreliable formal banking systems.  The system relies on a network of hawala brokers who act as intermediaries, facilitating the transfer of funds without the use of traditional banking channels.  Transactions typically involve a credit and debit system between brokers, with the sender paying a broker in one location and the recipient collecting the money from a different broker in another location.  While efficient and often cheaper than formal banking, hawala systems are also vulnerable to misuse for illegal activities, including money laundering and financing terrorism.|例句：The money was transferred through a hawala system, making it difficult to trace. 这笔钱是通过哈瓦拉系统转账的，这使得追踪它变得困难。|近义词：money transfer, remittance, informal transfer |反义词：formal banking system
