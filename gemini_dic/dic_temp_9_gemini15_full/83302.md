gynecocracy:/ˌɡaɪnɪˈkɑːkrəsi/ | n. | 女性统治；女权政治 | A form of government ruled by women.  It is a term often used in a fictional or theoretical context, and rarely describes a real-world political system.  The term often carries connotations of matriarchy, but not all matriarchies are gynecocracies.  A gynecocracy implies a political system specifically dominated by women, while a matriarchy may simply refer to a society where women hold primary power in various aspects of life, not necessarily in a formalized political structure. | Example: The novel depicts a utopian society governed by a benevolent gynecocracy.  小说描绘了一个由仁慈的女性统治的乌托邦社会。 | 近义词：matriarchy, female rule | 反义词：androcracy, patriarchy |  名词
