The word "pulingly" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a very rare, possibly dialectal, word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis according to your requested format.  To help, I need clarification:

* **Did you perhaps misspell a word?**  Could you double-check the spelling or provide the sentence where you encountered this word?  Knowing the context will help determine the intended word.

* **Is this a neologism or a word from a specific field or dialect?**  If so, please provide that information.


Without more information, a detailed analysis is impossible.
