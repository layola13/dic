The word "citiner" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps a word related to "citizen," "citation," "citing," or something else entirely?  Providing more context about where you encountered this word would be helpful.

2. **It's a neologism or a word from a specific field:** It might be a newly coined word, a technical term, or a word used within a particular community or subculture. Again, context is crucial.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or a place name.


Without further information, I cannot provide a detailed analysis as requested. Please clarify the word or provide more context.
