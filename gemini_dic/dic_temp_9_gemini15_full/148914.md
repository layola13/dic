overwillingnesses:/ˌoʊvərˈwɪlɪŋnəsɪz/ | n. | 过度乐意；过分愿意 |  This word is not a standard English word. It is likely a neologism (newly coined word) formed by combining "over" (meaning excessive) and "willingness" (meaning readiness or eagerness). Therefore, it would describe an excessive or undue eagerness to do something. There is no established dictionary definition or common usage.  It's important to avoid using this word in formal writing unless its meaning is clearly defined within the context. |  Example: His overwillingnesses to help backfired, as he ended up hindering more than assisting.  他的过度热心帮倒忙，结果适得其反。 |近义词: excessive eagerness, overenthusiasm |反义词: reluctance, unwillingness |名词
