词源:

The word "constabulary" originates from the Old French word "constable," which ultimately derives from the Latin "comes stabuli," meaning "count of the stable."  Initially, constables were officials responsible for maintaining order, particularly within the royal household and stables. Over time, the role and meaning evolved to encompass the broader function of policing. The suffix "-ary" denotes a place, group, or system associated with the root word.
