词源:
Gelatin derives from the French word "gelée," meaning "jelly," which in turn comes from the Latin word "gelata," the past participle of "gelare," meaning "to freeze."  The suffix "-in" is a common chemical suffix indicating a substance.  Therefore, gelatin essentially means "a frozen substance."
