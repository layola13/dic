microseism:/ˈmaɪkroʊˌsɪzəm/| n. |微震，小地震 |A microseism is a very small earthquake, typically undetectable without sensitive instruments.  These tremors are often caused by natural phenomena like ocean waves or human activities. |Example: The scientists detected a series of microseisms originating from the nearby coast.  科学家探测到一系列来自附近海岸的微震。  |近义词：tremor, minor earthquake |反义词：macroseism, major earthquake


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Microseisms are often caused by ocean waves. = 微震通常是由海浪引起的。
Scientists study microseisms to understand geological processes. = 科学家研究微震以了解地质过程。

一般过去时:
The seismograph recorded several microseisms last night. = 昨晚地震仪记录了几次微震。
Researchers analyzed the microseisms to locate the source. = 研究人员分析了微震以确定震源。

现在完成时:
Scientists have detected many microseisms in this region. = 科学家们在这个地区探测到了许多微震。
Researchers have used microseism data to model seismic activity. = 研究人员已经利用微震数据来模拟地震活动。

过去完成时:
Before the major earthquake, there had been a series of microseisms. = 在大地震之前，发生了一系列微震。
Geologists had observed similar microseisms in previous studies. = 地质学家在之前的研究中观察到类似的微震。

将来时:
We will monitor for microseisms during the experiment. = 我们将在实验期间监测微震。
The new sensors will detect even smaller microseisms. = 新传感器将探测到更小的微震。

虚拟语气:
If there were more sensitive instruments, we could detect smaller microseisms. = 如果有更灵敏的仪器，我们就能探测到更小的微震。
It's important that we accurately measure these microseisms. = 准确测量这些微震非常重要。

被动语态:
Many microseisms are caused by human activities. = 许多微震是由人类活动引起的。
The microseisms were recorded by a sensitive seismograph. = 微震是由灵敏的地震仪记录的。

疑问句:
What causes these microseisms? = 这些微震是由什么引起的？
How are microseisms different from larger earthquakes? = 微震与大地震有什么不同？

否定句:
The seismograph did not detect any microseisms. = 地震仪没有探测到任何微震。
These microseisms are not strong enough to cause damage. = 这些微震不足以造成破坏。


PHRASE->
microseism activity: 微震活动
microseism monitoring: 微震监测
microseism detection: 微震探测
microseism analysis: 微震分析
