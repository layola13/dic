词源：The word "racket" ultimately derives from the Old French word "raquette," meaning "small bat" or "paddle." This word is believed to have influenced the development of the word racket in English, initially referring to the sports equipment.  The sense of "loud noise" developed later, likely due to the sound associated with striking a ball with a racket. The meanings of "fraud" and "illegal activity" also emerged later, possibly due to the association of rackets with organized crime and their often noisy and disruptive nature.
