felsitic:/fɛlˈsɪtɪk/| adj.|霏细质的，长英质的 | Relating to or characteristic of felsic rocks, which are light-colored igneous rocks that are rich in feldspar and silica.  These rocks are typically high in silicon and aluminum, and low in iron and magnesium.  | The geologist identified the sample as a felsitic rock due to its light color and high silica content.  |  siliceous, rhyolitic | mafic, ultramafic |


USAGE->

被动语态:
The felsitic nature of the rock was confirmed by microscopic analysis. = 岩石的霏细质特性通过显微镜分析得到证实。
The rock sample is being analyzed to determine its felsitic properties. = 正在分析岩石样本以确定其霏细质特性。


疑问句:
Is this rock sample felsitic in nature? = 这个岩石样本是霏细质的吗？
Are there any other felsitic formations nearby? = 附近还有其他霏细质地层吗？


否定句:
The rock is not felsitic; it's mafic. = 这块岩石不是霏细质的；它是基性的。
The analysis showed that the sample was not primarily felsitic. = 分析表明该样本并非主要由霏细质组成。
