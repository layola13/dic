词源:
The word "dolled" originates from the word "doll," meaning a child's toy.  The sense of being "dolled up"  developed from the idea of dressing a doll up in fancy clothes, and then extending that meaning to people being similarly adorned.  The use of "doll" in this context likely emerged in the 19th century.
