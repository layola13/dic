circumrotation: /ˌsɜːrkəmroʊˈteɪʃən/ | n. | 环绕旋转；旋转运动 | The act or process of rotating around something.  It often implies a complete rotation or a rotation around a central point or axis.  | 例句：The Earth's circumrotation on its axis causes day and night. 地球绕其轴自转导致昼夜交替。


The circumrotation of the satellite around the planet was precisely measured.  卫星绕行星的环绕旋转被精确测量。| 近义词：rotation, revolution, gyration | 反义词：stationary, still
