non-chaotic: /ˌnɒnˈkeɪɒtɪk/ | adj. | 非混沌的，非混乱的 | Not exhibiting chaotic behavior; predictable and stable.  The opposite of chaotic.  This term is used in various fields, particularly mathematics, physics, and computer science, to describe systems or processes that are not characterized by sensitive dependence on initial conditions and unpredictable behavior. |


例句：

The system showed non-chaotic behavior, making it easy to predict its future states.  = 系统表现出非混沌行为，因此很容易预测其未来的状态。

The simulation results indicated a non-chaotic trajectory for the particle. = 模拟结果表明粒子的轨迹是非混沌的。


近义词：orderly, predictable, stable, regular


反义词：chaotic, turbulent, unpredictable, erratic


词性：形容词


USAGE->
一般现在时:

虚拟语气:
If the parameters were different, the system might exhibit chaotic behavior, but it currently displays non-chaotic behavior.=如果参数不同，系统可能会表现出混沌行为，但目前它表现出非混沌行为。
Were the initial conditions slightly altered, the system would still remain non-chaotic. = 如果初始条件略有改变，系统仍然会保持非混沌状态。


被动语态:
Non-chaotic patterns were observed in the data. = 在数据中观察到非混沌模式。
The non-chaotic nature of the system was confirmed by the experiment. = 实验证实了该系统的非混沌性质。


疑问句:
Is the system's behavior truly non-chaotic? = 系统的行为真的是非混沌的吗？
Does this model exhibit non-chaotic dynamics under all conditions? = 这个模型在所有条件下都表现出非混沌动力学吗？


否定句:
The system is not non-chaotic; it's highly chaotic. = 系统不是非混沌的；它是高度混沌的。
The results did not indicate non-chaotic behavior. = 结果没有表明非混沌行为。


PHRASE->
non-chaotic dynamics = 非混沌动力学
non-chaotic system = 非混沌系统
non-chaotic behavior = 非混沌行为
non-chaotic motion = 非混沌运动
