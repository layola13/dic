The word "delousers" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need clarification on the intended word or more context.  Is it possible you meant a different word?  If you can provide more information, I can offer a more accurate analysis.
