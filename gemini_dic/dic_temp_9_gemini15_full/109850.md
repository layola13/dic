USAGE->
This word is too new and specialized for typical grammatical usage examples. The term itself is the focus, not its usage in various tenses.  It's primarily used as an adjective to describe a type of therapy.


PHRASE->
No common phrases exist using "lexipharmic".  The word is too technical and newly coined.
