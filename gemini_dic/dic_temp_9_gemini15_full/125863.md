词源:
The word "muscatel" ultimately derives from the French word "muscat," which itself comes from the Arabic word "musk" (مسك), meaning "musk." This refers to the musky aroma characteristic of the muscat grape, which is used to produce muscatel wine.  The grapes themselves are named for their fragrance.
