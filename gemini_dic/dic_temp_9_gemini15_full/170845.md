pseudogeneric:/ˌsuːdoʊdʒəˈnɛrɪk/| adj.|伪泛型，似泛型的|  Relating to or characteristic of a pseudogeneric type in programming; appearing generic but not truly so.  A pseudogeneric type might appear to be applicable to various types, but it actually involves implicit type conversions or other techniques that limit its true genericity.| Example: "The library uses a pseudogeneric approach to handle different data types, which can lead to performance issues."|近义词：quasi-generic, seemingly generic|反义词： truly generic, specific


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in computer science, and as such, doesn't lend itself to the grammatical structures demonstrated in the example.  Instead, I will provide example sentences illustrating its use in different contexts within the field.

Example Sentences (Computer Science Context):

1. The function, while appearing generic, is actually pseudogeneric, relying on implicit type coercion to handle different input types. = 这个函数虽然看起来是泛型的，但实际上是伪泛型的，它依赖于隐式类型强制转换来处理不同的输入类型。

2.  The pseudogeneric design of the data structure led to unexpected behavior when using non-standard data types. = 该数据结构的伪泛型设计在使用非标准数据类型时导致了意外的行为。
