semianalytic:/ˌsemiˈænəˈlɪtɪk/| adj.| 半解析的 | Combining analytical and numerical methods; pertaining to a method or approach that uses both analytical and numerical techniques.  It often refers to methods in which part of the problem is solved analytically and the remaining part is solved numerically.  | Example: The semianalytic model provided a good approximation of the system's behavior. 半解析模型很好地逼近了系统的行为。 | 近义词：partially analytical, hybrid | 反义词：fully analytical, purely numerical |


USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective, so it doesn't have tenses like verbs.  Usage examples focus on its descriptive function.

Example 1 (Simple sentence):
The researchers used a semianalytic approach to solve the complex equation. 研究人员使用半解析方法来求解复杂的方程。

Example 2 (More complex sentence):
A semianalytic solution, combining Fourier transforms and finite element analysis, proved more efficient than a purely numerical approach for this specific problem.  结合傅里叶变换和有限元分析的半解析解，被证明比纯粹的数值方法对于这个问题更高效。

Example 3 (Comparative sentence):
While a fully analytical solution is ideal, a semianalytic method often provides a practical compromise when dealing with computationally intensive problems. 虽然完全解析解是理想的，但在处理计算密集型问题时，半解析方法通常提供了一种实用的折中方案。
