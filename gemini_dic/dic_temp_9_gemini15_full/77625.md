It consists of a sealed glass tube containing electrodes at either end and filled with a rarefied gas. When a high voltage is applied, the gas glows with a characteristic color depending on the gas used. | Example:  Early experiments with Geissler tubes led to the discovery of cathode rays.  早期盖斯勒管的实验导致了阴极射线的发现。|近义词：discharge tube, gas-discharge tube |反义词：N/A
