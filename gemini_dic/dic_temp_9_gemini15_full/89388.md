homoplastic:/ˌhoʊməˈplæstɪk/ | adj. | 同形的；同塑的 |  Resembling in form or structure but not in origin; analogous.  This refers to structures in different species that have similar appearances due to convergent evolution, not common ancestry.  They share similar functions but evolved independently.  | Example: The wings of a bird and the wings of a bat are homoplastic structures; they both enable flight but evolved separately.  鸟类的翅膀和蝙蝠的翅膀是同形结构；它们都能飞行，但进化过程是独立的。| 近义词：analogous, similar | 反义词：homologous


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The wings of a bird and a butterfly are homoplastic. = 鸟和蝴蝶的翅膀是同形的。
This structure is homoplastic in origin. = 这种结构在起源上是同形的。


一般过去时:
Scientists considered these structures homoplastic. = 科学家认为这些结构是同形的。
The researchers found that the feature was homoplastic. = 研究人员发现该特征是同形的。


现在完成时:
Researchers have confirmed that the trait is homoplastic. = 研究人员已经证实该性状是同形的。
Studies have shown many examples of homoplastic features. = 研究表明有很多同形特征的例子。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, they had believed the feature was homologous, but it had turned out to be homoplastic. = 分析之前，他们认为该特征是同源的，但结果证明是同形的。
Scientists had long debated whether the structures were homologous or homoplastic. = 科学家们长期以来一直在争论这些结构是同源的还是同形的。


将来时:
Future studies will likely reveal more homoplastic structures. = 未来的研究可能会揭示更多同形结构。
We will determine if the characteristic is homologous or homoplastic. = 我们将确定该特征是同源的还是同形的。


虚拟语气:
If the structures were homologous, they would share a common ancestor.  = 如果这些结构是同源的，它们将拥有共同的祖先。
If the trait were not homoplastic, it would indicate common ancestry. = 如果该性状不是同形的，它将表明共同的祖先。


被动语态:
The structures were identified as homoplastic by the researchers. = 研究人员将这些结构确定为同形的。
The evolutionary relationship was determined to be homoplastic. = 进化关系被确定为同形的。


疑问句:
Are these analogous structures truly homoplastic? = 这些类似的结构真的是同形的吗？
Is the observed similarity due to homology or homoplasy? = 观察到的相似性是由于同源性还是同形性？


否定句:
The structures are not homologous; they are homoplastic. = 这些结构不是同源的；它们是同形的。
The observed similarity is not due to common ancestry, but to homoplasy. = 观察到的相似性不是由于共同的祖先，而是由于同形性。


PHRASE->
homoplastic convergence  同形趋同
homoplastic evolution  同形进化
homoplastic similarity  同形相似性
homoplastic characters  同形性状
homoplastic traits  同形性状
