词源：

The phrase "cut and run" originates from nautical terminology.  "Cut" referred to cutting the anchor cable to allow for a quick escape, and "run" signifies the act of fleeing.  The phrase's metaphorical use extended to describe hasty retreats from any difficult situation, not just naval battles.  The first recorded use in this broader sense dates back to the late 19th century.
