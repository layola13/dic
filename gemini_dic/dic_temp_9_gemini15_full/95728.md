词源：

The word "inconsiderable" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "considerable," which itself comes from the verb "consider."  The root of "consider" is the Latin "considerare," meaning "to contemplate, to examine carefully." Therefore, "inconsiderable" literally means "not worth considering" or "not significant enough to be considered."


用法说明：

"Inconsiderable" is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that is small, unimportant, or insignificant in quantity, value, or impact. It emphasizes the lack of importance or significance of something.  It is often used to downplay the magnitude of something, implying that it is too small to warrant much attention.
