词源：

The word "self-persuasion" is a compound word formed from "self" and "persuasion."  "Self" is an Old English word meaning "one's own," while "persuasion" comes from the Old French word "persuasion," ultimately derived from the Latin "persuadere," meaning "to persuade."  Therefore, self-persuasion literally means the act of persuading oneself.
