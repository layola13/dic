词源:  The word "ribauld" comes from Old French *ribauz, meaning "soldier,"  possibly of Germanic origin.  The modern meaning, referring to a vulgar or dissolute person, developed later.  The connection between the military term and the later meaning of vulgarity is unclear, but may relate to the often rough and unrefined behavior associated with soldiers.
