词源:

The word "pallier" originates from the Old French word "palier," meaning "a landing (on a staircase),"  ultimately deriving from the Latin "palea," meaning "straw,"  possibly referencing the use of straw for filling or padding in flooring.  The sense of "mitigation" is a later development, metaphorically extending from the idea of a level or resting place in a difficult process.
