由于“dual's”本身并非一个独立存在的英语单词，它可能是“dual”的所属格形式，或者是一个拼写错误。因此，我将分别解释“dual”和“dual's”可能的含义及用法。


**1. dual:**

/ˈduːəl/ | adj. | 双重的；双的 | Having two parts, elements, or aspects.  |例句：The system has a dual function.  这个系统有双重功能。 |近义词：double, twofold, twin |反义词：single, solitary

**2. dual's:**

This is likely a possessive form of "dual," indicating belonging to or associated with something dual.  For example:

"The dual's purpose is unclear." (The purpose of something that is dual is unclear). This would be grammatically correct but quite awkward.  Better phrasing would be: "The purpose of the dual system is unclear," or "The dual system's purpose is unclear."


In short, "dual's" is not a common word and should generally be avoided in favor of clearer phrasing that uses the possessive form with a noun, as illustrated above.
