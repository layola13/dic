词源:

The word "overcivility" is a modern English word formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the noun "civility" (meaning politeness or courtesy).  "Civility" itself comes from the Latin word "civilis," meaning "of or relating to citizens," which evolved to mean polite and courteous behavior.
