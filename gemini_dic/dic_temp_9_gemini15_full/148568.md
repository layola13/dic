词源:
The word "overtaker" is derived from the verb "overtake," which combines the prefix "over-" (meaning "above," "beyond," or "across") with the verb "take."  "Overtake" originally meant to come up with and surpass, and later developed the meaning of passing a vehicle while driving.  The suffix "-er" is an agent noun suffix indicating the person or thing performing the action. Therefore, "overtaker" denotes the person or thing that performs the action of overtaking.
