词源:  The word is a combination of "hero-worship" (itself a compound noun) and the suffix "-ful," which means "full of" or "characterized by." "Hero-worship" emerged in the 19th century, reflecting the growing interest in biographical narratives and the romanticization of historical figures.  The "hero" element traces back to the Greek word "hērōs," meaning "hero," while "worship" comes from the Old English "weorþscipe," meaning "honor, worth."
