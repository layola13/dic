disingenuous:/ˌdɪsɪnˈdʒɛnjuəs/ | adj. |不真诚的；虚伪的；不坦率的 | Not candid or sincere; pretending to be honest or innocent.  | 例句：His disingenuous remarks about helping the poor were clearly designed to win votes.  他的关于帮助穷人的不真诚言论显然是为了赢得选票。

近义词：insincere, deceitful, dishonest, hypocritical, false, underhanded | 反义词：sincere, honest, genuine, frank, candid, truthful


词源：dis- (否定前缀) + ingenuous (天真的，坦率的)  The word ultimately derives from the Latin "ingenus," meaning "inborn," "natural," or "of noble birth."  Over time, "ingenuous" came to mean "innocent" and "candid," and the prefix "dis-" reverses this meaning.
