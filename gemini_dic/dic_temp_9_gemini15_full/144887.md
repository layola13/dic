词源:
The word "overrun" is a compound word formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "above," "beyond," or "excessive") and the verb "run" (meaning "to move swiftly," "to extend," or "to operate").  Therefore, "overrun" literally means "to run over" or "to exceed."  Its development reflects the natural extension of the meaning of "run" to encompass spatial and temporal boundaries.
