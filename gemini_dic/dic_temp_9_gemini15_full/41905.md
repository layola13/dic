cosmic-strings: /ˈkɒzmɪk strɪŋz/ | n. |宇宙弦 | Extremely thin, hypothetical one-dimensional topological defects in spacetime that are predicted by some cosmological models.  They are thought to have formed in the very early universe during phase transitions, and might have played a role in the formation of large-scale structures.  Their existence is currently unconfirmed. | 例句：The theory of cosmic strings proposes that these incredibly dense objects could have seeded the formation of galaxies. = 宇宙弦理论提出，这些极其致密的物体可能促成了星系的形成。

The existence of cosmic strings is still highly speculative, and their properties are subject to ongoing research. = 宇宙弦的存在仍然高度推测性，其特性仍在不断研究中。
