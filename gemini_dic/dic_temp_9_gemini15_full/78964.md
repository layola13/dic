词源:
The word "girlhood" is a compound word formed from "girl" and "-hood."  "-hood" is a suffix that forms nouns meaning "state," "condition," "quality," or "period of life."  Therefore, "girlhood" signifies the state or period of being a girl.  The word "girl" itself has Old English roots, ultimately deriving from terms meaning "young woman" or "child."
