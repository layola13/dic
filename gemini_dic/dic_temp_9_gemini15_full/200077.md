词源：The origin is uncertain, but it's likely a combination of "skew" (meaning to turn or twist to one side) and "whiff" (a slight gust of wind or a slight deviation). The combination suggests a slight, haphazard twisting or tilting.  The "whiff" element may contribute to the sense of something being slightly off-kilter or not quite right.
