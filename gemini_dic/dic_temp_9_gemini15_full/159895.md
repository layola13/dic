polymyodae:/ˌpɒliˈmaɪoʊdeɪ/|/n.|多肌科|Polymyodae is a taxonomic family of insects belonging to the order Diptera.  It is characterized by the possession of multiple muscles in specific body regions. The exact characteristics can vary depending on the specific subfamilies and species within the family. Further research is needed to fully define and understand the characteristics of this family and its phylogenetic relationships.|The classification and characteristics of polymyodae are still under investigation by entomologists.|近义词:  (需要更多信息才能提供近义词，因为该词相对较窄)|反义词: (没有直接的反义词)|名词
