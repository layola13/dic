ETYMOLOGY->
The word "mellifluousness" is derived from:

* **mellifluous:**  This adjective itself is a combination of:
    * **melliflu-:** from Latin *mellīfluus*, meaning "honey-flowing" or "flowing with honey."  This combines *mel-,* the stem of *mel* ("honey"), and *fluō* ("to flow").
    * **-ous:**  An adjective suffix.
* **-ness:** A noun suffix indicating a state or quality.


Therefore, mellifluousness literally means "the quality of flowing like honey,"  evoking the imagery of something sweet and smoothly flowing.
