词源:

The word "codependency" is a relatively modern term. It emerged in the 1970s and 1980s within the context of the recovery movement, particularly in relation to the treatment of alcoholism.  It combines "co-" (meaning "together" or "jointly") with "dependency," which itself derives from the Old French word "dependre" meaning "to hang down from". The term reflects the idea of a mutual or shared dependence that is often dysfunctional and harmful.
