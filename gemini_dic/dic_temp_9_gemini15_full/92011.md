hyperosmolar:/ˌhaɪpərˈɒzməʊlər/| /ˌhaɪpərˈɒzmoʊlər/ | adj. |高渗透压的；高渗的 | Having a higher osmotic pressure than a particular solution, especially than the blood plasma.  This term usually refers to a solution's concentration of solutes compared to another solution.  | 例句：The hyperosmolar solution caused the cells to shrink. 高渗溶液导致细胞收缩。
The patient presented with hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. 病人出现高渗高血糖状态。|近义词：hypertonic |反义词：hypoosmolar

否定句:
The solution is not hyperosmolar; it's isotonic. = 溶液不是高渗的；它是等渗的。
The cells did not shrink because the solution was not hyperosmolar enough. = 细胞没有收缩，因为溶液不够高渗。
