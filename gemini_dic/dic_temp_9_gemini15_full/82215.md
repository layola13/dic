词源:
The word "grotesque" comes from the Italian word "grottesco," which itself derives from the Italian word "grotta," meaning "cave."  This is because in the 15th and 16th centuries, the term was first used to describe the strange and fantastical decorations found in the Roman grottoes (caves) that were being rediscovered at that time.  These decorations often featured hybrid creatures and distorted human figures.  The word eventually made its way into English, retaining its association with the bizarre and unnatural.
