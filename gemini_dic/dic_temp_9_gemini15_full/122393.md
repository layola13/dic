The word "mmed" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  It could be a typo of another word.  If you could provide the intended word or context, I can give you its analysis.

2. **An abbreviation or slang:** It might be an abbreviation used within a specific context or a slang term with a limited understanding.  Again, more context is needed.

3. **A non-English word:**  It could be a word from another language.

To help me provide the analysis you're looking for, please clarify what word you meant to write or provide the sentence in which "mmed" appears.
