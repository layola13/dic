词源:

From Latin *curvus ("curved") + serialis ("of a series").  It combines the sense of "curved" with the idea of a series or sequence arranged in a curve.


用法说明:

Curviserial is primarily used in botanical contexts to describe the arrangement of leaves, flowers, or other plant parts along a stem or branch in a curved line.  It can also be used more generally to describe any arrangement of objects in a curved or winding pattern.  However, it is a relatively uncommon word and may not be readily understood by all speakers of English.
