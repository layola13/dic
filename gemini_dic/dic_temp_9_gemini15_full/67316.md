词源:  From Late Latin *exstaticus, from Greek ekstatikos "causing to stand outside oneself," from ekstasis "a placing outside, displacement," from ek- "out" + histanai "to stand, cause to stand."  The original sense referred to a state of being outside oneself, often in a religious or mystical context.  The modern meaning evolved from this, associating the feeling of being "outside oneself" with intense joy and excitement.
