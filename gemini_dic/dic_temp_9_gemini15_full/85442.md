hash-over:/ˈhæʃˌoʊvər/| n. |散列覆盖，重新散列|The process of applying a hash function to data multiple times, often to enhance security or data integrity. This technique is used in cryptography and data management to increase the complexity of the hash value and make it more resistant to attacks or collisions.|Example: The system uses a hash-over technique to ensure data integrity and prevent tampering.|近义词：rehashing, multiple hashing|反义词：None


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The system hashes over the data every minute. = 系统每分钟对数据进行散列覆盖。
They hash over the password before storing it. = 他们在存储密码之前对其进行散列覆盖。


一般过去时:
The administrator hashed over the sensitive information. = 管理员对敏感信息进行了散列覆盖。
We hashed over the file to create a secure checksum. = 我们对文件进行散列覆盖以创建安全的校验和。


现在完成时:
The security team has hashed over all the transaction records. = 安全团队已经对所有交易记录进行了散列覆盖。
They have hashed over the database multiple times for added security. = 为了增加安全性，他们已经对数据库进行了多次散列覆盖。


过去完成时:
The program had hashed over the data before the error occurred. = 在错误发生之前，程序已经对数据进行了散列覆盖。
The system had hashed over the password several times, but it was still compromised. = 系统已经对密码进行了多次散列覆盖，但它仍然被攻破了。


将来时:
The new software will hash over the data automatically. = 新软件将自动对数据进行散列覆盖。
We will hash over the files before transferring them to the cloud. = 我们将在将文件传输到云端之前对它们进行散列覆盖。


虚拟语气:
If we hashed over the data more frequently, we would reduce the risk of data breaches. = 如果我们更频繁地对数据进行散列覆盖，我们将降低数据泄露的风险。
It would be safer if they hashed over the passwords using a stronger algorithm. = 如果他们使用更强大的算法对密码进行散列覆盖，将会更安全。


被动语态:
The data was hashed over to ensure its authenticity. = 数据经过散列覆盖以确保其真实性。
The passwords are hashed over multiple times to prevent unauthorized access. = 密码经过多次散列覆盖以防止未经授权的访问。


疑问句:
Does the system hash over the data before transmission? = 系统在传输数据之前是否对其进行散列覆盖？
How often is the data hashed over for security purposes? = 为了安全起见，数据多久进行一次散列覆盖？


否定句:
The program did not hash over the data correctly. = 程序没有正确地对数据进行散列覆盖。
The system does not hash over the data by default. = 系统默认情况下不对数据进行散列覆盖。
