词源:

Cuteness is derived from "cute," which first appeared in the 19th century.  While the precise origin is debated, it is likely a variant or shortening of "acute," originally meaning "sharp, clever."  Over time, its meaning shifted to describe something small and appealing, eventually leading to the modern meaning of "cute."  The suffix "-ness" simply adds the abstract noun quality to the adjective "cute."
