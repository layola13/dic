近义词：unreasonably, irrationally, foolishly, absurdly, insanely, wildly


反义词：rationally, sanely, sensibly, logically


词源：The word is a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "sanely" (meaning "in a sane manner").  "Sanely" derives from "sane," ultimately from Latin *sanus ("sound, healthy").  Therefore, "nonsanely" literally means "not in a sane manner."
