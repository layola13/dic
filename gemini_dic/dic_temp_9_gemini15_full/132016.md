noncorrelations:/ˌnɒnkɒrəˈleɪʃənz/ | n. |非相关性，不相关 | The absence of a correlation between two or more variables.  This means that changes in one variable do not predict changes in the other.  Noncorrelations can be due to a lack of relationship, or they can be masked by other factors.  Analyzing noncorrelations is important in statistical analysis to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. | Example:  The study revealed a noncorrelation between ice cream sales and crime rates.  这项研究揭示了冰淇淋销量与犯罪率之间没有相关性。


| 近义词: lack of correlation, independence, unrelatedness | 反义词: correlation, dependence, relatedness |  词性: 名词
