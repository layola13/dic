词源:  The word "grayscale" is a compound word.  "Gray" comes from the Old English word "græg," meaning "gray." "Scale" comes from the Old French word "escale," ultimately from the Latin word "scala," meaning "ladder" or "staircase."  In this context, "scale" refers to a range or series of gradations.  Therefore, "grayscale" literally means a range or scale of grays.
