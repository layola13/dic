词源：

Derived from "plain" + "-ish", a suffix used to form adjectives meaning "somewhat" or "rather".  "Plain" itself originates from Old French "plein," meaning "full," "flat," or "even."  The meaning evolved to describe something simple and unadorned.


用法说明：

"Plainish" is an adjective used to describe something that is somewhat plain, simple, or unadorned, but not entirely so. It suggests a degree of plainness that is not extreme or unattractive, but rather subtly lacking in ornamentation or visual interest.  It softens the potentially harsh judgment of simply calling something "plain."
