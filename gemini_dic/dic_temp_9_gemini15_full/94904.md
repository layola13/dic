词源:

The phrase combines "in" (meaning "in the state of"), "full" (meaning "complete" or "entire"), and "swing" (referring to a rhythmical movement or activity). The imagery suggests something moving with full, energetic momentum.  The "swing"  originates from the Old English word "swingan," meaning "to sway or move rhythmically."  The sense of full activity evolved over time.
