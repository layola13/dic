oscillation:/ˌɒsɪˈleɪʃən/ /ˌɑːsɪˈleɪʃən/ | n. | 振荡；摆动； колебание | The regular back-and-forth movement of a system around a central point or value.  Oscillations can be periodic or aperiodic, and can be described by their amplitude, frequency, and phase. | Example: The pendulum showed a smooth oscillation.  摆锤显示出平稳的摆动。

The bridge experienced significant oscillation during the storm.  桥梁在暴风雨期间经历了剧烈的振荡。


近义词：vibration, fluctuation, sway, swing, wavering

反义词：stability, stillness, steadiness


词源：From Latin *oscillat- (past participle stem of oscillare "to swing," from oscilla "swinging thing," diminutive of os "mouth").  The ultimate origin is thought to be onomatopoeic.
