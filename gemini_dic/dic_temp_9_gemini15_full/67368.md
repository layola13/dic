The word "extensivenesses" is the plural form of "extensiveness," which itself is a noun.  There is no verb, adjective, or adverb form directly derived from this word.  The meaning is derived from "extensive," meaning covering or affecting a large area.

**Etymology:**

The word "extensivenesses" traces its origins back to:

* **Extensive:**  From Latin *extensus*, past participle of *extendere* ("to stretch out").  *Extendere* is composed of *ex-* ("out") + *tendere* ("to stretch").

* **-ness:** This suffix is added to adjectives to form nouns denoting a quality or state.

Therefore, "extensiveness" signifies the quality or state of being extensive, and "extensivenesses" refers to multiple instances or aspects of this quality.


**Usage Examples:**

While grammatically correct,  "extensivenesses" is rarely used in common writing or speech.  The singular "extensiveness" is far more common and generally sufficient.  Using the plural implies a need to distinguish several distinct types or instances of extensive qualities.  For example:

* The extensivenesses of the desert's landscape, encompassing vast sand dunes and barren plains, were breathtaking. (Here, we distinguish between the vastness of the dunes and the vastness of the plains.)

*  The extensivenesses of his knowledge, in both science and the humanities, were a testament to his dedication to lifelong learning. (Here, we distinguish between the extent of his scientific knowledge and the extent of his humanities knowledge.)

These examples demonstrate that while the word exists, it’s stylistically awkward and generally replaceable with more concise phrasing.  For example, the above sentences could be rewritten as:

* The extensive desert landscape, encompassing vast sand dunes and barren plains, was breathtaking.

* The extent of his knowledge in both science and the humanities was a testament to his dedication to lifelong learning.


**Word Forms and Related Words:**

* **extensive (adjective):** covering or affecting a large area.
* **extensively (adverb):** to a great extent; widely.
* **extend (verb):** to make something longer or larger.
* **extension (noun):** the act of extending something; an additional part or period.
* **extent (noun):** the area covered by something; the degree to which something happens.


It's important to note that while grammatically correct, the word "extensivenesses" is considered unnecessarily verbose and should be avoided in most writing contexts.  Simpler and more natural alternatives always exist.
