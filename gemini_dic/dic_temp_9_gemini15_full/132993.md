WORD ORIGIN->

The word "nonenforceability" is derived from:

* **non-**: a prefix meaning "not"
* **enforce**:  verb meaning "to compel observance of (a law, rule, etc.)"  From Old French *enforcier (to strengthen), from *en- + *forcier (to force).
* **-ability**: a suffix denoting "the quality or state of being able to be..."


Therefore, nonenforceability literally means "the state of not being able to be enforced."
