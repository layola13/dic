self-weighted:/ˌselfˈweɪtɪd/| adj. | 自加权的，自重加权的 |  Describes a system or process where the weight or importance of individual components is determined internally, without external input or predefined weights.  This often involves a feedback mechanism or iterative process where the weight of each component is adjusted based on its contribution or performance.  | Example: The self-weighted algorithm automatically assigns higher weights to more relevant features.  自加权算法会自动为更相关的特征分配更高的权重。 |近义词：automatically weighted, internally weighted | 反义词：externally weighted, pre-weighted


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in technical contexts, especially in machine learning, statistics, and signal processing. Therefore, the standard verb tenses are less relevant than in words with broader usage.  We will instead illustrate usage in different contexts relevant to its application.


In machine learning:

A self-weighted averaging system produced superior results. = 自加权平均系统产生了更好的结果。
The model used a self-weighted approach to handle class imbalance. = 该模型使用自加权方法来处理类别不平衡。


In statistics:

Self-weighted regression analysis yielded more robust estimates. = 自加权回归分析产生了更稳健的估计值。
The self-weighted sampling method reduced bias in the study. = 自加权抽样方法减少了研究中的偏差。


In signal processing:

A self-weighted filter effectively removed noise from the signal. = 自加权滤波器有效地去除了信号中的噪声。
The system employed a self-weighted averaging technique to improve signal clarity. = 该系统采用自加权平均技术来提高信号清晰度。


PHRASE->
There are no common multi-word phrases directly involving "self-weighted".  The term is typically used as a standalone adjective modifying a noun (e.g., self-weighted average, self-weighted algorithm).
