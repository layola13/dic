The word "grait" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a regional dialect word.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide helpful information, I need a correctly spelled word.  If you meant a different word, please provide the correct spelling.
