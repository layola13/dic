词源:  The word "roustabout" is a compound word. "Roust" comes from the Middle English word "rowsten," meaning "to rouse, stir up, or disturb,"  and "about" indicates activity or movement.  Originally, it referred to someone who roused things about or moved things around, implying a general worker involved in various tasks.  The association with oil rigs and similar industries came later.
