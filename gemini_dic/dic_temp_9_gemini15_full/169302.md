词源：

Derived from the word "promise," ultimately from Old French "promettre" (to promise),  from Latin "promittere" (to promise), composed of "pro-" (forth) + "mittere" (to send).  Thus, "promissive" literally relates to something that "sends forth" a sign of future success.

用法说明：

promissive is primarily used as an adjective to describe something or someone that shows potential for future success or positive development. It often implies a degree of uncertainty, suggesting that the success is not guaranteed but likely.  It's less common than its synonym "promising," but carries a similar meaning.  The difference is subtle, with "promising" being slightly more common and versatile in everyday language.
