semaphore:/ˈsɛməˌfɔːr/|/ˈsɛməˌfɔːr/| n. |信号；信号机；信号装置 |A semaphore is a visual signaling system, often using flags, lights, or arms, to communicate messages over a distance.  It can also refer to a data structure used for process synchronization in computer science. |例句：The sailors used a semaphore to communicate with the ship on the horizon. 海员用信号旗与地平线上的船只联络。  The program uses a semaphore to control access to a shared resource. 程序使用信号量来控制对共享资源的访问。 |近义词：signal, indicator, flag |反义词：silence, absence  |名词

USAGE->

PHRASE->
semaphore signal = 信号信号
semaphore system = 信号系统
binary semaphore = 二进制信号量
counting semaphore = 计数信号量
mutex semaphore = 互斥信号量


词源:
The word "semaphore" comes from the Greek words *sema* (σῆμα), meaning "sign" or "signal," and *pherein* (φέρειν), meaning "to bear" or "to carry."  The combination thus literally means "to carry a sign."  The term was first used in its modern sense in the early 19th century, referring to visual signaling systems.
