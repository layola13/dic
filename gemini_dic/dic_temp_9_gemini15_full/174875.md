词源:
The word "racketeer" is derived from "racket," which originally referred to a swindle or a fraudulent scheme.  The term "racket" itself has uncertain origins, possibly related to the Old French word "raquette," meaning "a bat or paddle," possibly suggesting a deceptive or manipulative game or scheme.  The "-eer" suffix indicates a person who engages in the activity.
