choliambic: /ˌkoʊliˈæmbɪk/ | adj. | 跛足诗句的；（诗歌）有残足格的 |  A choliambic is a verse line in which all feet except the final one are iambs (unstressed syllable followed by a stressed syllable), and the final foot is a spondee (two stressed syllables) or a pyrrhic (two unstressed syllables).  It is also known as a scazon.  This metrical pattern often creates a sense of unevenness or limping effect, mirroring the meaning or mood of the text. | Example:  Many examples exist in ancient Greek literature, but are hard to translate directly due to the nature of the meter. A modern approximation illustrating the final spondee might be:  "The / KING / is / DEAD / and / GONE." (Note that this is a highly simplified example and the stress placement can vary depending on interpretation). | 近义词: scazon | 反义词: iambic (in the sense of perfectly regular meter)
