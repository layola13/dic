词源:

The word "meth" is a shortened form of "methamphetamine," which itself is a combination of "methyl" and "amphetamine."  "Methyl" derives from "methylene," referring to a chemical group. "Amphetamine" is derived from the Greek "amphe," meaning "on both sides," and "amine," referring to a class of organic compounds.  The combination suggests the drug's chemical structure and its effect on the central nervous system.
