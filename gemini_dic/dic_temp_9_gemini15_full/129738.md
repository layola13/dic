英文解析：The word "non-equitable" is formed by the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "equitable," which means "fair, just, and impartial." Therefore, "non-equitable" signifies a lack of fairness or justice.  It suggests a situation where things are not distributed or handled in a way that is considered right or morally acceptable.

词源：

* **equitable:**  Comes from the Latin word "aequus," meaning "equal,"  and the suffix "-able," indicating something capable of being done or existing.  "Equitable" thus originally meant "capable of being made equal."

* **non-:**  A prefix of negation, derived from Latin, meaning "not."


用法说明:  "Non-equitable" is primarily used as an adjective to describe situations, systems, or processes that are unfair or unjust.  It is often used in legal, economic, and social contexts to highlight imbalances or inequalities.  It carries a stronger implication of injustice than simply "unfair," suggesting a systemic or structural problem rather than an isolated instance.
