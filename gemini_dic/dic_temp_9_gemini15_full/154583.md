词源:
The word "persecution" comes from the Late Latin word "persecutionem," a noun of action formed from the verb "persequi," meaning "to pursue," "to follow after," or "to prosecute."  The "per-" prefix suggests intensity or completion, and "-sequi" is related to the Latin word "sequor," meaning "I follow." Therefore, the original meaning was a thorough or relentless pursuit.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the oppressive and harmful nature of such pursuit, particularly in the context of targeting individuals or groups for their beliefs or characteristics.
