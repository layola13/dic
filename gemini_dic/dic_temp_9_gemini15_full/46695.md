Etymology:

The word "damson" comes from the Middle English word *damsine*, which itself derives from the Old French *damascene*, referring to Damascus plums.  These plums were originally cultivated in Syria and spread throughout Europe. The suffix "-plum" simply specifies that it is a type of plum.  Therefore, the full etymology traces back to the place of origin of the fruit via linguistic evolution.
