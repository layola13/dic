cosh:/kɒʃ/| n.|双曲余弦|The hyperbolic cosine is a hyperbolic function.  It is defined as the average of the exponential of a number and its inverse.  Its formula is cosh(x) = (e^x + e^-x)/2.  It's an even function, meaning cosh(-x) = cosh(x).|The graph of cosh(x) resembles a parabola, but it isn't actually a parabola. The catenary curve, the shape a hanging chain forms under its own weight, is described by the hyperbolic cosine function.|近义词:None (due to its unique mathematical definition)|反义词:None (due to its unique mathematical definition)|名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in mathematical contexts and doesn't have typical grammatical tenses like "hello."  Instead, its usage is demonstrated within mathematical equations and formulas.

Example 1:
cosh(0) = 1  = 双曲余弦0等于1

Example 2:
The catenary curve is defined by y = a cosh(x/a). =悬链线由y = a cosh(x/a)定义


PHRASE->
cosh x,  cosh(x),  derivate of cosh x, integral of cosh x,  inverse cosh x
