词源:
The word "halcyonian" comes from the ancient Greek word "halcyon," referring to the kingfisher bird.  Ancient Greeks believed that kingfishers nested on the sea during the winter solstice, and during this time, the sea was calm. This period of calm was associated with peace and prosperity, leading to the metaphorical use of "halcyonian" to describe peaceful and happy times.
