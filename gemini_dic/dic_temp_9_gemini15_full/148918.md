词源:
The word "overwinded" is formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") to the past participle "winded" of the verb "wind."  The verb "wind" in this context refers to the act of tightening a spring, such as in a clock or toy, or to metaphorically describe the state of being excited or agitated.  Therefore, "overwinded" describes a state of being excessively wound up, either literally or figuratively.
