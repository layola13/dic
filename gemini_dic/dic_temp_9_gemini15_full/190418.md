sarsa:/ˈsɑːrsɑː/| n. |萨萨算法|SARSA (State–Action–Reward–State–Action) is a reinforcement learning algorithm.  It's an on-policy algorithm, meaning that it learns the value of a policy by following that policy. It's used to find an optimal policy for an agent in an environment by learning from its interactions.  The algorithm updates its estimates based on the actual actions taken, making it different from Q-learning. |Example:  The SARSA algorithm was implemented to train a robot to navigate a maze.|近义词：Q-learning (but with key differences)|反义词：N/A|名词
