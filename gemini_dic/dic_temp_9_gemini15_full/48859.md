deformations:/ˌdiːfɔːrˈmeɪʃənz/ | n. |变形，畸形 | Changes in the shape or form of something.  Deformations can be caused by various factors, including stress, pressure, or genetic factors.  They are commonly observed in materials science, geology, and biology. |例句：The earthquake caused significant deformations in the landscape. 地震导致地貌发生了显著的变形。

The intense heat led to deformations in the metal structure. 剧烈的热量导致金属结构变形。


近义词：distortions, malformations, warpings |反义词：regularity, uniformity


词性：名词
