nonlineal: /ˌnɒnˈlɪniəl/ | adj. | 非线性的 | Not relating to or involving a straight line; characterized by nonlinearity.  A nonlinear system is one in which the output is not directly proportional to the input.  This is in contrast to a linear system, where a change in input results in a proportional change in the output.  Nonlinearity is common in many natural phenomena and systems. | The relationship between stress and strain in many materials is nonlinear.  | 近义词：curvilinear, curved | 反义词：linear


例句：

The relationship between the applied force and the resulting displacement is nonlinear. =施加的力和由此产生的位移之间的关系是非线性的。
