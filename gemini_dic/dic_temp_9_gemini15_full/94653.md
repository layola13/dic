词源:

The word "impressionistically" is derived from "Impressionism," a 19th-century art movement.  "Impressionism" itself comes from the French word "impression," meaning "impression," which is ultimately derived from the Latin verb "imprimō," meaning "to press in," "to stamp," or "to imprint." The "-istically" suffix indicates a manner or style.  Therefore, "impressionistically" means "in the manner of Impressionism."
