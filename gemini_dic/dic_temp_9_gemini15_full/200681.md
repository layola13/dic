词源:
The word "sleekness" derives from the Middle English word "sleek," meaning "smooth, glossy."  This, in turn, is likely related to Old Norse words suggesting smoothness or glossiness.  The "-ness" suffix is a common English suffix that turns an adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality.
