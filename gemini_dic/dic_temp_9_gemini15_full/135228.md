The word "nonpaganish" is not a standard English word and does not appear in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and detailed grammatical breakdown are impossible.  The word seems to be a neologism (newly coined word) likely formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") with a word resembling "paganish" (which itself is not a standard word, but implies something related to paganism).


Let's break down its possible components:


* **non-**:  /nɒn/ | prefix | 非，不 | This prefix negates the following word.  It's widely used in English to create antonyms.

* **paganish**:  (hypothetical)  This part seems intended to suggest something related to paganism.  "Pagan" /ˈpeɪɡən/ | adj., n. | 异教徒的；异教徒 | refers to someone who is not a follower of a widely practiced religion, often associated with nature worship.  The "-ish" suffix adds a somewhat informal and imprecise quality, suggesting a resemblance to or a slight inclination towards paganism.


Therefore, "nonpaganish" could be interpreted as meaning "not pagan-like" or "not characteristic of paganism."  However, without context, its precise meaning remains ambiguous.


Because it's not a real word, I cannot provide examples of its usage, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis in different tenses or voices.  To use this word would be highly unconventional and might be seen as invented for a specific purpose, perhaps fictional writing.
