词源:  The word "contracting-out" is a compound word formed from the verb "contract" and the adverbial preposition "out."  "Contract" originates from the Old French word "contracter," meaning "to draw together, shorten," ultimately derived from the Latin "contrahere," with "con-" meaning "together" and "trahere" meaning "to draw." The "out" indicates the direction of the action – transferring work or responsibility outside the organization.
