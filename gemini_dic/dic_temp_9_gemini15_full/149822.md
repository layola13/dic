paleologist:/ˌpeɪliˈɒlədʒɪst/| n. |古生物学家|A paleontologist is a scientist who studies fossils to learn about ancient life.  Paleontologists work to understand the history of life on Earth, from the earliest single-celled organisms to the dinosaurs and other creatures that lived millions of years ago. They use a variety of techniques, including excavation, analysis of fossil structures, and dating methods, to reconstruct the past. |例句：The paleontologist carefully brushed away the dirt to reveal the dinosaur bone.  古生物学家小心翼翼地拂去泥土，露出了恐龙骨骼。

The paleontologist's research shed new light on the evolution of early mammals.  这位古生物学家的研究为早期哺乳动物的进化提供了新的线索。|近义词：fossil expert, paleobiologist |反义词：无
