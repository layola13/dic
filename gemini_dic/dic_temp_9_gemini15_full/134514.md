词源:  The word is a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "liberal."  "Liberal" originates from the Latin word "liberalis," meaning "pertaining to a free person," ultimately related to "liber," meaning "free."  The modern political usage of "liberal" evolved over time, taking on different meanings in various countries and contexts.  The term "nonliberal," therefore, emerged as a descriptor for those who oppose or reject the tenets of liberalism as understood in a given context.
