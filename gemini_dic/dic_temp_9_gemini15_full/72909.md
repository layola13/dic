词源:

The word "fomenter" comes from the Old French word "fomenter," meaning "to cherish, foster, foment," which in turn derives from the Latin word "foveō," meaning "to warm, cherish, foster." The original sense focused on nurturing or fostering something, but it evolved to include the negative connotation of stirring up trouble.  The shift in meaning reflects how nurturing something negative, like discord or unrest, can lead to harmful consequences.
