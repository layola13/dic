The word "reaccents" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage explanation cannot be provided.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word), a misspelling, or a word from a highly specialized field.

To assist, if you can provide context where you encountered this word (sentence, paragraph, field of study), I may be able to offer a plausible interpretation or suggest a similar word.
