The word "historier" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word, such as "histories" (plural of history), "historians" (people who study history), or a similar word.

2. **It's a neologism:** It could be a newly coined word, specific to a certain field or context.  Without more information about where you encountered this word, it's impossible to define it.

3. **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into English.
