词源:

The word "friskful" is derived from the verb "frisk," meaning "to leap or skip playfully."  "Frisk" itself has origins in Middle Dutch *frisken "to leap, dance," and ultimately from Proto-Germanic *friskaz. The "-ful" suffix adds the meaning of "full of" or "characterized by," thus creating the adjective "friskful."
