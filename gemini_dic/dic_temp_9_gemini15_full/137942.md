词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "warranted," which derives from the Old French word "warrantier" meaning "to guarantee" or "to vouch for."  The ultimate root lies in the Germanic "waron" meaning "to protect" or "to secure."  Thus, "nonwarranted" literally means "not guaranteed" or "not protected."
