The word "dwine" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it, and therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a very rare word, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a dialect not widely recorded.  To provide the analysis you request, I need a valid English word.
