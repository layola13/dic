The word "nonfeeblest" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a complete analysis following your requested format is impossible.  However, we can break down its potential meaning and components:


"non-"  /nɒn/ | prefix | 非，不 |  This prefix indicates negation or absence.


"feeblest" /ˈfiːblɪst/ | adj. | 最虚弱的 | This is the superlative form of "feeble," meaning weak or lacking strength.


Therefore, "nonfeeblest" would hypothetically mean "not the weakest," or perhaps "strongest"  (though this is not a direct antonym).


Since it is not a recognized word, providing examples of its usage, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical analysis is not feasible.  If you encountered this word in a specific context, providing that context would help determine its intended meaning and origin.
