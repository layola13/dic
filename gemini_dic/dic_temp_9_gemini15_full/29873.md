词源:
The word "causeway" comes from the Old French "chaussée," meaning "paved road."  The "chaussee" itself derives from the Latin "calciata," a road made of stones (calx, meaning "lime" or "gravel").  The meaning evolved to encompass raised roads, particularly those built across marshy or watery areas.
