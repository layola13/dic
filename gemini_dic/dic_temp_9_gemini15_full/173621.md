词源:
The word is a combination of "quasi," meaning "seemingly" or "to a certain extent," and "inspected," the past participle of the verb "to inspect," meaning "to examine thoroughly."  Therefore, "quasi-inspected" describes something that has undergone a less thorough examination than a full inspection.
