词源:  The word derives from the adjective "sacrificial," which itself comes from the noun "sacrifice."  "Sacrifice" originates from the Old French "sacrifice," ultimately tracing back to the Latin "sacrificium," a compound of "sacer" (sacred, holy) and "facere" (to make, to do). Thus, "sacrificially" implies an action performed in a manner befitting a sacred offering or a selfless act of giving.
