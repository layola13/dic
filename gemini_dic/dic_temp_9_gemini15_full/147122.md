词源:
The word "overloaded" comes from the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "load" (meaning "to put a load on").  The original meaning refers to putting too much weight or burden on something.  The meaning has since expanded to include excessive work, information, or data.
