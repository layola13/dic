词源:
The word "poculent" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  It's likely a less common or perhaps even a newly coined word based on the root "poc" suggesting abundance, possibly influenced by words like "copious" or "opulent."  Further etymological research would be needed to determine its precise origin if it exists outside of very niche usage.
