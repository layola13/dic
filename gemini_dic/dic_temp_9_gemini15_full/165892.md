preoperculum: /ˌpriːˈɒpəkjuːləm/ | n. |鳃盖骨前骨| The preoperculum is a bone in the head of bony fishes, located anterior to the operculum (the main gill cover). It's typically a thin, somewhat triangular bone, and its shape and size vary significantly across different fish species.  It contributes to the structure of the gill cover and plays a role in the movement of the operculum during respiration. |The preoperculum of the fish was damaged in the accident.|近义词:None, it's a specific anatomical term.|反义词:None|名词
