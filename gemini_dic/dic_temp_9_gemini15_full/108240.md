词源:  The word "laughingstock" combines "laughing" (present participle of the verb "to laugh") and "stock," which in this context refers to a person or thing that is subject to something.  The "stock" here is related to the older meaning of "stock" as something readily available or easily used, like a "scapegoat".  Thus, a laughingstock is someone readily available to be laughed at.

用法说明：

laughingstock 总是作名词使用，通常指一个人或一件事因为愚蠢或可笑的行为而被嘲笑的对象。  它强调的是被嘲笑的对象本身，而不是嘲笑的行为。
