etiolin: /ɪˈtiːəlɪn/ | n. | 黄化苗，黄化植物 | A plant that has been grown in the dark, resulting in a lack of chlorophyll and a yellow or pale appearance.  Etiolated plants are typically long and spindly due to their attempt to reach light. | Example: The etiolin showed a marked increase in stem length compared to the control plants grown in light.  黄化苗与在光照下生长的对照组植物相比，茎长明显增加。 | 近义词: bleached plant, blanched plant | 反义词: green plant
