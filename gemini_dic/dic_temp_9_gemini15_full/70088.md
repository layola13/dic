The word "feuter" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word, a word specific to a certain dialect or community, or slang not yet widely recognized.
* **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into standard English.


If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, the surrounding sentence, etc.), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
