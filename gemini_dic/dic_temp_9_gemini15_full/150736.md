词源:
The word "parachutic" is derived from "parachute," which in turn originates from the French word "parachute," coined in the late 18th century.  It's a combination of "para-" (meaning "against" or "beside") and "chute" (meaning "fall").  Therefore, "parachute" literally means "against the fall," and "parachutic" describes things related to this device or action.
