resample:/ˌriːˈsæmpəl/ | vt. |重新采样，重新抽样 | To sample again; to create a new sample from an existing one, often by modifying or reducing the original data.  This process is common in signal processing, statistics, and machine learning. |例句：We need to resample the audio to a higher sampling rate. 我们需要将音频重新采样到更高的采样率。

The image was resampled to a lower resolution for faster loading. 图片被重新采样到较低的解析度以加快加载速度。

词源:
The word "resample" is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the verb "sample" (meaning to take a sample or a small portion of something).  The word's meaning and usage evolved alongside the development of technologies and methodologies requiring repeated sampling processes, particularly in digital signal processing and statistics.
