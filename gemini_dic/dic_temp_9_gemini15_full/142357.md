词源:
The word "orthopaedic" (and its variant "orthopedic") comes from the Greek words "orthos" (ὀρθός), meaning "straight," and "pais" (παῖς), meaning "child."  The original meaning referred to the correction of deformities in children, though the field now encompasses adults as well.  The "-ic" suffix indicates an adjective.
