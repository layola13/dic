photoejection:/ˌfoʊtoʊɪˈdʒɛkʃən/| n.|光电发射|The emission of electrons from a material (usually a metal) when light shines on it.  This effect is a key component in the operation of photoelectric devices.  The energy of the emitted electrons depends on the frequency of the light, not its intensity. |Example: The photoejection of electrons from the cathode is essential for the functioning of this photomultiplier tube.  光阴极的光电子发射对于该光电倍增管的正常工作至关重要。|近义词：photoemission|反义词：photoabsorption|名词


USAGE->
