词源:
The word "freeloader" is a compound word. It combines "free" (meaning without payment) and "loader" (referring to someone who loads or takes something).  The "-er" suffix indicates a person who performs the action.  It emerged in the early 20th century, likely reflecting societal changes and the increasing prevalence of casual social interactions where the lines of contribution were sometimes blurred.
