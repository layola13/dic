词源:

The word "indomitabilities" is derived from the adjective "indomitable," which itself comes from the Old French word "indomitable," meaning "untamable."  The suffix "-abilities" transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the qualities or characteristics of being indomitable.  The root "dom" relates to "tame" or "subdue," and the "in-" prefix negates it.  Therefore, "indomitable" means "unyielding" or "unconquerable."
