The word "prepiouser" is not a recognized word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or derivations.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A newly coined word:**  If it's a newly coined word, more context is needed to understand its meaning and usage.
* **A word from a specific dialect or jargon:** If it's from a specific field or community, indicating that would be helpful.


Please provide the correct spelling or more context, and I will be happy to help.
