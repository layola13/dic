metamictness:/ˈmɛtəmɪktnəs/| n. |亚晶质化；非晶质化 |The state of a crystalline material that has become amorphous due to self-irradiation.  This process often occurs in minerals containing radioactive elements. Metamict minerals lose their crystalline structure and become X-ray amorphous.  |例句：The metamictness of zircon is a well-studied phenomenon. 锆石的亚晶质化是一个被充分研究的现象。

The metamictness of the sample was confirmed by X-ray diffraction. 样品的亚晶质化通过X射线衍射得到证实。


近义词：amorphization, vitrification |反义词：crystallinity


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in geology and materials science, so verb conjugations and other grammatical structures related to the word itself are not commonly used in everyday language.  The grammatical structures would apply to sentences describing the process or state of metamictness, not to the word itself.

For example, one might use these structures to describe the metamict state:


一般现在时:
The mineral shows metamictness. = 这种矿物表现出亚晶质化。
This process causes metamictness in many uranium-bearing minerals. = 这个过程导致许多含铀矿物发生亚晶质化。


一般过去时:
The sample exhibited significant metamictness. = 样品表现出明显的亚晶质化。
The metamictness was confirmed by electron microscopy. = 亚晶质化通过电子显微镜得到证实。


现在完成时:
Researchers have observed metamictness in various minerals. = 研究人员在各种矿物中观察到亚晶质化。
Scientists have extensively studied the causes of metamictness. = 科学家们广泛研究了亚晶质化的原因。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, the sample had already undergone some degree of metamictness. = 在分析之前，样品已经经历了一定程度的亚晶质化。
They had suspected metamictness before conducting the experiments. = 在进行实验之前，他们就怀疑存在亚晶质化。


将来时:
Further research will investigate the degree of metamictness. = 后续研究将调查亚晶质化的程度。
We will determine the extent of metamictness using advanced techniques. = 我们将使用先进技术来确定亚晶质化的程度。


虚拟语气:
If the mineral were completely metamict, it would be X-ray amorphous. = 如果矿物完全亚晶质化，它将是X射线非晶态的。
It is likely that the sample would show more metamictness under higher radiation exposure. = 在更高的辐射照射下，样品很可能表现出更强的亚晶质化。


被动语态:
The metamictness was induced by alpha-particle bombardment. = 亚晶质化是由α粒子轰击引起的。
The degree of metamictness is determined by various factors. = 亚晶质化的程度由各种因素决定。


疑问句:
Does the mineral show signs of metamictness? = 这种矿物是否显示出亚晶质化的迹象？
What are the factors contributing to metamictness in this sample? = 导致该样品亚晶质化的因素是什么？


否定句:
The sample did not exhibit significant metamictness. = 样品没有表现出明显的亚晶质化。
The mineral was not completely metamict. = 矿物并非完全亚晶质化。



PHRASE->
There aren't common idiomatic phrases using "metamictness".  The term is highly specialized.  However, we can construct phrases relevant to its usage:


degree of metamictness: 亚晶质化程度
causes of metamictness: 亚晶质化的原因
effects of metamictness: 亚晶质化的影响
metamict mineral: 亚晶质矿物
study of metamictness: 亚晶质化的研究
