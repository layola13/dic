词源:

The word "impact" comes from the Middle French word "impact," meaning "a collision," which itself ultimately derives from the Latin word "impactus," the past participle of "impingere," meaning "to drive in," "to fix," or "to fasten."  The evolution of the word reflects its broadening usage from a purely physical collision to encompass a wider range of influences and effects.
