词源:
The word "renegading" comes from the verb "renege," which itself ultimately derives from the Old French word "renegat," meaning "apostate" or "renegade."  This in turn has roots in the Latin "renegare," meaning "to deny again." The prefix "re-" indicates repetition or reversal, and "negare" means "to deny."  Therefore, "renegading" signifies a repeated or reversed denial of a commitment or agreement.
