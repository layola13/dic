词源:
The word "inconfusion" is a relatively rare word, not commonly found in dictionaries.  It is formed by adding the prefix "in-" (meaning "in" or "not," but here functioning more as an intensifier) to the word "confusion."  Therefore, its etymology traces back to the Latin word "confundere," meaning "to pour together, mix up, confuse."  The "in-" prefix adds emphasis to the state of being confused.
