词源:

The word "melancholies" is the plural form of "melancholy," which has a rich and fascinating etymology.  It ultimately derives from the Ancient Greek word *μελαγχολία* (*melancholia*), a compound word formed from:

* *μέλας* (*melas*) meaning "black" or "dark"
* *χολή* (*cholē*) meaning "bile"

In ancient Greek humoral theory,  melancholy was believed to be caused by an excess of black bile (one of the four humors). This theory linked physical imbalances with psychological states.  The concept of melancholy evolved over time, losing its strictly medical connotation and taking on more literary and artistic significance, encompassing a range of pensive and wistful emotions.  The English word "melancholy" appeared in the Middle English period, borrowing directly from the Late Latin *melancholia*.
