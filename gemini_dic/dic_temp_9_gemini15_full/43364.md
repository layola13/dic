词源:
The word "crane" ultimately derives from the Old English word "cran," which referred to a bird with a long neck. The meaning of the verb "craning" is a figurative extension of the bird's behavior of stretching its neck.  The use of "crane" as a machine for lifting heavy objects is a later development, with the association likely coming from the long neck and the ability to raise things high.
