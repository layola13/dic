词源:

The word "concertanti" is derived from the Italian word "concertare," meaning "to concert," "to agree," or "to harmonize."  This, in turn, originates from the Latin word "concertare," with similar meanings.  The "-anti" suffix in Italian is used to form adjectives, indicating a quality or characteristic of something.  Therefore, "concertanti" literally translates to something having the quality of being "concerted" or "harmonized" in a musical sense.
