The word "niellist" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries like Merriam-Webster, Oxford English Dictionary, or Cambridge Dictionary.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, word class, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word. Could you double-check the spelling?
* **It's a neologism:** It might be a newly coined word not yet widely accepted.
* **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or place name.
* **It's jargon or slang:** It might be used within a specific community or context.

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if possible so I can assist you.
