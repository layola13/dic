词源:  The word "dementor" is a neologism coined by J.K. Rowling for her Harry Potter series.  It's likely derived from the words "de-" (meaning "away from" or "removal of") and "mentor," possibly suggesting a being that deprives one of their mental faculties or guidance, leaving them empty and despairing.  There is no pre-existing word with the same meaning.
