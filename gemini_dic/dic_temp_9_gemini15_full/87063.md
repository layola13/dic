heptahedrons:/ˌheptəˈhiːdrənz/| n. |七面体|A heptahedron is a three-dimensional geometric shape with seven faces.  It can take many different forms, as there are many ways to combine seven polygons to form a closed three-dimensional shape.  Unlike some polyhedra with specific constraints on their shapes (like cubes), heptahedrons exhibit significant variety.|The crystal structure displayed a complex heptahedral arrangement.|近义词：polyhedron (更广义)|反义词：无
