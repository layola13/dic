The word "scamell" is not a valid word in standard English. There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a regional dialect word, or a proper noun (like a name).

If you could provide more context where you encountered this word, it might be possible to determine its meaning or offer a suggestion for a correct spelling.
