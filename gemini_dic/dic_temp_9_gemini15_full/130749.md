词源：

The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "amenable," which comes from the Old French word "amenable," meaning "easily led or managed," ultimately derived from the Latin "ad" (to) + "mensis" (mind).  Therefore, "nonamenable" literally means "not easily led or managed."
