词源:
The word "mafioso" is derived from the Italian word "mafia," which itself has a complex and debated etymology. While the exact origin remains uncertain,  theories link it to words like "maffia" (meaning "swaggering" or "bravado" in Sicilian dialect) and "muffa" (meaning "mould" or "decay").  Ultimately,  "mafioso" emerged to describe members of the Sicilian organized crime syndicate.  The word then spread internationally as the Mafia's influence expanded.
