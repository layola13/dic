词源:
From *imperial* + *-ist*.  *Imperial* derives from Latin *imperialis*, from *imperium* ("command, power, empire").  The suffix *-ist* indicates a person or thing associated with something.  Therefore, *imperialist* literally means "related to or characteristic of empire" or "a person who supports empire building."
