malapropisms:/ˈmæləˌprɒpɪzəm/| n. | 字词错用；滑稽的用词错误 |The humorous misuse of a word in place of a similar-sounding one, often with unintentionally amusing effect.  Malapropisms are often caused by a speaker's imperfect knowledge of vocabulary or pronunciation.  They are named after Mrs. Malaprop, a character in Richard Sheridan's play *The Rivals*, who was known for her frequent and amusing word substitutions. |例句：She said "dance attendance on" instead of "pay attention to," a classic malapropism. 她说了“dance attendance on”（侍奉）而不是“pay attention to”（注意），这是一个典型的字词错用。

例句：He used "infer" when he meant "imply," a common malapropism. 他用了“infer”（推断）但本意是“imply”（暗示），这是一个常见的字词错用。
