词源:
The word "dwarf" comes from Old English *dweorg, related to Old High German *twerg and Old Norse *dvergr.  The ultimate origin is uncertain, but possible connections have been proposed to Proto-Indo-European roots related to "small" or "bent." The plural "dwarves" reflects a more archaic plural form, while "dwarfs" is a more modern, regular plural.
