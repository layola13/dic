词源:
The word "serve" ultimately derives from the Latin word "servire," meaning "to be a slave," "to serve," or "to be subject to."  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the various senses we use today, moving from the literal sense of servitude to the more abstract meanings of service, assistance, and provision.
