multistability: /ˌmʌltiˈsteɪbɪləti/ | n. |多稳态性，多稳定性 | The capacity of a system to exist in multiple stable states.  This phenomenon is observed in various systems, from physical systems like lasers and electronic circuits to biological systems like neural networks and gene regulatory networks.  Each stable state is characterized by a distinct set of properties, and transitions between these states can be induced by external stimuli or internal fluctuations. | Example: "The multistability of the gene regulatory network allows for different cell fates." = 基因调控网络的多稳态性允许不同的细胞命运。|近义词：polystability |反义词：monostability
