The word "encentre" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established meaning, pronunciation, etymology, or usage.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specialized field not widely known.  To provide a detailed analysis as requested, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about its potential origin.
