WORD ORIGIN->

Exposedness is derived from the adjective "exposed," which comes from the verb "expose."  "Expose" ultimately traces back to the Old French word "exposer," which itself combines the Latin prefix "ex-" (out, from) and the Latin verb "ponere" (to put, to place). Therefore, "exposedness" literally means the state of being "put out" or "uncovered."
