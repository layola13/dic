词源:

The term "full-colour" is a compound adjective.  "Full" signifies completeness or the entirety of something, while "colour" (or "color" in American English) refers to the hue or shade of an object. The combination indicates the use of the entire spectrum of colours possible in a given medium.  The word "colour" ultimately derives from the Old French "color," itself from the Latin "color," meaning "appearance, complexion, guise."
