词源:  The word "sarcelle" comes from the Old French word "sarcele," which itself is of uncertain origin.  Some etymologists suggest a connection to the Latin word *anser*, meaning "goose," though this link is not definitive. The word likely evolved through various dialectal variations before settling into its modern French form.  It then entered English as a loanword, primarily used in contexts discussing waterfowl.
