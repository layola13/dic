词源:  The word "hackneyed" ultimately derives from "hackney," which originally referred to a horse for hire in Hackney, a district of London.  These horses were often overworked and thus became a metaphor for something overused and worn out.  The adjective form "hackneyed" emerged later to describe things that were similarly tired and lacking originality.
