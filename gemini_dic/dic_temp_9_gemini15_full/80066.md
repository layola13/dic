词源:  The word "goalposts" is a compound word. "Goal" derives from the Old French "goal," meaning "a stick," which evolved from the Old Norse "gálgr," meaning "gallows" or "execution post."  Over time, "goal" came to refer to the target in various games. "Posts" is the plural of "post," from the Latin "postem," meaning "a post, pillar, or stake." Thus, "goalposts" literally means the posts marking the goal.
