词源:
The name "Ithaca" comes from Ithaca, the island home of Odysseus in Homer's epic poem, the Odyssey.  The name was given to the New York city by early settlers.

The name Ithaca is ultimately of Greek origin, derived from the ancient Greek word Ἰθάκη (Ithakē).  The exact etymology of the Greek word is uncertain, but some theories suggest it might relate to words meaning "fishy place" or "standing place".
