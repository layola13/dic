近义词：obediently, submissively, compliantly, meekly


反义词：defiantly, rebelliously, disobediently


词源:  Derived from the verb "ply," meaning to work steadily or persistently, or to use something repeatedly.  The adverbial suffix "-ingly" indicates manner or way.  The sense of "plyingly" shifts from the original meaning of persistent work to a compliant yielding, perhaps because persistent plying of someone could eventually lead to their submission.
