saxs:/sæks/| n.|小角X射线散射|Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a scattering technique used to characterize the size, shape, and aggregation state of macromolecules and nanomaterials in solution.  It measures the intensity of X-rays scattered at very small angles (typically less than 5 degrees) by a sample.  By analyzing the scattering pattern, information about the size and shape of the particles can be obtained.|例句：SAXS analysis revealed that the protein formed dimers in solution.  小角X射线散射分析表明该蛋白质在溶液中形成二聚体。|近义词：Small-angle scattering (SAS)|反义词：无|名词
