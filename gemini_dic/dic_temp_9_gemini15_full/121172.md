词源:  The word "misdictated" is formed by adding the prefix "mis-" (meaning "wrongly" or "badly") to the past participle of the verb "dictate."  "Dictate" comes from the Latin word "dictare," meaning "to say, to speak, to pronounce, to order."  Therefore, "misdictated" literally means "wrongly spoken or written down."
