The word "highle" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical analysis, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  It's likely a misspelling or a very obscure, regional, or invented word.
