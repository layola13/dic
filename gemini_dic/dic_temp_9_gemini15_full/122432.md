词源:
From Middle English *moten, from Old French mot(e) (modern French motte), from Late Latin *mōta, from Latin mōtus, past participle of movēre "to move".  The meaning evolved from an earthen mound to a moat surrounding such a mound, and finally to any water-surrounded structure.  Essentially, it describes something moved or placed in a defensive position.
