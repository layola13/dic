quasi-inferior:/ˈkwɑːzi ɪnˈfɪəriər/ | adj. | 准劣等；似劣等 |  Describes a good whose demand decreases as income increases, but not as drastically as with an inferior good.  It exhibits some characteristics of an inferior good but not all.  The decrease in demand is less pronounced compared to a true inferior good. | Example:  Ramen noodles might be considered a quasi-inferior good. As income rises, consumption might decrease slightly, but it wouldn't entirely disappear.  People might still buy it occasionally for convenience or a nostalgic treat, unlike a true inferior good which would be replaced entirely with a superior alternative.| 近义词：near-inferior | 反义词：superior, normal, luxury
