词源:

The word "metamorphosis" comes from the late Middle English word *metamorphose*, which itself is derived from the Late Latin word *metamorphosis*, a combination of the Greek words *meta-*(μετά-) meaning "after," "beyond," or "change," and *morphē*(μορφή) meaning "form" or "shape."  Therefore, the word literally means "a change of form."
