/ˌoʊvərˈkɑːnstəntnəsɪz/ | n. |过度不变性；过度稳定性 |  The word "overconstantnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, formed by combining "over-" (meaning excessively), "constant" (meaning unchanging), and the plural suffix "-nesses".  It suggests an excessive or undesirable degree of unchanging qualities or states.  There are no standard dictionaries that list this word, and its meaning is entirely dependent on context.  Because it's not a real word, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage is not possible in the standard sense.  To understand its potential meaning, one must analyze the context in which it is used. For example, one might use it to describe a system that is excessively rigid and inflexible, or a personality that is excessively unchanging and resistant to new experiences.
