词源:
The word "pegger" derives from the verb "peg," which ultimately comes from the Old English word "pæc," meaning "a pointed stick" or "a peg."  The use of "peg" to mean "to fasten with a peg" is very old. The extension of meaning to include price fixing and currency pegging is a more recent development, reflecting the metaphorical use of "peg" to hold something in place. The slang usage referring to a sexual partner is a more recent and informal development.
