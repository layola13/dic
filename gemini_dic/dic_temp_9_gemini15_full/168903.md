词源:

The word "professionalist" is a relatively recent addition to the English language, derived from the word "professional."  "Professional" itself comes from the Middle French *professionel*, ultimately from the Latin *professio* meaning "declaration," "avowal," or "open expression,"  referring to a publicly declared occupation or calling.  The suffix "-ist" is added to create a noun signifying a person who practices or is associated with a particular profession.
