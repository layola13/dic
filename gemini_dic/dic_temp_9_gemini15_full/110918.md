lipogram:/ˈlɪpəˌɡræm/ | n. | 字谜；去字母诗 | A lipogram is a written work composed according to a rule that excludes one or more letters of the alphabet.  The challenge lies in constructing coherent and meaningful text while adhering to the self-imposed restriction.  Lipograms can range from short phrases to lengthy novels. | Example:  A famous example is Georges Perec's novel "La Disparition," which is written without the letter "e".  This novel demonstrates the remarkable feat of writing a substantial work while omitting a common letter. | 近义词：constrained writing, letterless writing | 反义词：None directly applicable, but the opposite would be unrestricted writing. |
