passing-as: /ˈpæsɪŋ æz/ | adj. phr. |冒充…；以…身份示人|  Describes someone who presents themselves publicly as a member of a different social group than the one they are privately identified with. This is often used in the context of gender identity (passing as a man or woman), race, or other social categories.  The success of "passing" often depends on societal acceptance and the individual's ability to convincingly embody the characteristics associated with the target group. |例句：She's been passing as a man for years. 她多年来一直伪装成男人。

She successfully passed as a native speaker. 她成功地冒充为母语人士。


近义词：masquerading as, posing as, impersonating |反义词：being open about, being oneself, revealing one's true identity


词源:  "Passing" comes from the verb "pass," meaning to be accepted or regarded as something.  "As" functions as a preposition, indicating the identity being adopted.  The phrase's meaning evolved from its earlier usage indicating simply the act of successfully blending into a particular group to its more complex contemporary meaning often linked to social identities and societal expectations.
