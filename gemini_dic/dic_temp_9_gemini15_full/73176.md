词源:  The word "forbidding" comes from the verb "forbid," which ultimately derives from the Old English "forbeodan," a compound of "for-" (meaning "completely" or "away") and "beodan" (meaning "to offer, command, or announce").  Therefore, "forbidding" originally meant something that was completely prohibited or commanded to be kept away from.  Over time, its meaning evolved to encompass the feeling or impression of something being unpleasant, threatening, or unwelcoming.
