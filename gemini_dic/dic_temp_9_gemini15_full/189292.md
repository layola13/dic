词源:
The word is a portmanteau (blend) of "sadism" (from the Marquis de Sade, a French writer known for his depictions of cruelty and sexual violence) and "masochism" (from Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, an Austrian writer whose works featured characters who derived pleasure from suffering).  Both terms were coined in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
