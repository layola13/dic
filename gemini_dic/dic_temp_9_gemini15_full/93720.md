词源:
From Middle French *immanence, from Latin immanēns, present participle of immanēre "to remain in, stay in," from in- "in" + manēre "to remain, stay."  The original Latin term implies an inherent or intrinsic presence within something.

用法说明:

immanence is primarily used as a noun.  It is frequently used in philosophical and theological discussions, but can also be applied in other contexts to describe the intrinsic quality or presence of something.  The word carries a sense of being deeply embedded or inherent, rather than simply being superficially present.
