词源:
The word "gruelling" ultimately derives from the verb "gruel," meaning to make into a gruel or to exhaust.  "Gruel" itself comes from the Old French "gruel," which in turn has roots in the Latin "grullus," referring to a type of coarse porridge. The sense of exhaustion likely developed from the association of gruel with a tiring, monotonous process.
