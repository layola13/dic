interganglionic: /ˌɪntərɡæŋɡliˈɒnɪk/ | adj. |节间神经的，节间神经的| Relating to or situated between ganglia.  It describes structures, processes, or connections that exist between ganglia (clusters of nerve cell bodies).| The interganglionic connections are crucial for coordinated activity across the nervous system.  节间神经连接对于整个神经系统的协调活动至关重要。|近义词: interneuronal (if referring to neurons within ganglia)|反义词: intraganglionic (within a ganglion)
