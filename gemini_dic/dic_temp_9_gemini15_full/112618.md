low-cut:/ˈloʊ kʌt/ | adj. |低胸的，低领的 | Having a neckline or cut that reveals a significant portion of the chest.  It often refers to clothing, particularly dresses, tops, and swimwear. |例句：She wore a low-cut dress to the party. 她穿着低胸的衣服去参加派对。

例句：The low-cut swimsuit showed off her tan. 这件低胸泳衣展现了她晒黑的皮肤。


近义词：revealing, plunging, décolletage (n.)|反义词：high-necked, turtleneck, modest


词源:  The term is a compound of "low" (meaning positioned downwards) and "cut" (referring to the way a garment is shaped or sewn).  The meaning derives directly from the visual effect of the garment's neckline.  There isn't a specific historical etymology beyond this straightforward combination of existing words.
