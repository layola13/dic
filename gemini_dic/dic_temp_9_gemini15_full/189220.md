PHRASE->

The word "sacrilegiousnesses" is a rarely used plural noun.  Phrases using it would depend heavily on the context, and constructing common phrases is difficult.  Instead, let's show examples using the singular "sacrilegiousness":

词源:

The word derives from the adjective "sacrilegious," which itself comes from the Late Latin *sacrilegium,  a combination of *sacr- (sacred) and *leg- (to gather, to choose).  The suffix "-ness" creates the noun form indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, "sacrilegiousnesses" signifies multiple instances of the state of being sacrilegious.
