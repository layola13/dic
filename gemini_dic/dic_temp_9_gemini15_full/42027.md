USAGE->
This word is extremely rare and  doesn't have typical usage examples across different tenses, voices, or moods like common words.  Its usage would be highly context-specific and likely replaced with simpler, more natural alternatives.  Therefore, providing examples in different grammatical structures is not practical or useful.


PHRASE->
Because "costlessnesses" is an unusual and infrequently used word,  it doesn't have common or established phrases associated with it.  Instead, phrases would be built around the concept of "costlessness" or "free things" rather than the word itself.  For example:  "free of charge," "without cost," "at no expense,"  "complimentary services," "gratis offerings."
