词源：The word "rightwiseness" is a less common but perfectly valid older English word.  It's a compound word formed from "right" (meaning morally correct, proper) and "wise" (meaning having or showing good judgment).  The "-ness" suffix denotes a quality or state.  It reflects a time when "wise" had a stronger connotation of moral uprightness than it often does today.  The word's usage declined as "righteousness" became more prevalent.
