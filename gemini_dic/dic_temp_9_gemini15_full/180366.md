词源:
The word "refurbishments" is derived from the verb "refurbish," which is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the verb "furnish" (meaning "to equip or supply with what is needed").  Therefore, "refurbish" literally means "to furnish again," implying a renewal or restoration of something.  The suffix "-ments" transforms the verb into a noun, denoting the act or process of refurbishing.
