词源:
The word "counterbalance" is a compound word.  "Counter" is a prefix meaning "against" or "opposite," deriving from Old French "contre" and ultimately from Latin "contra."  "Balance" comes from Old French "balance,"  from Vulgar Latin *bilanx, from Latin "bis" (twice) + "lanx" (scale).  Therefore, "counterbalance" literally means "to balance against" or "to weigh against."
