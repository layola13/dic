词源:
The word "despondently" is derived from the adjective "despondent," which comes from the Middle English word "despondent," ultimately from the Old French "despendre," meaning "to hang down," "to droop," or "to lose heart."  The prefix "de-" implies "down" or "away," while the root "-spond-" is related to words like "respond" and "correspond," suggesting a turning away or loss of hope.
