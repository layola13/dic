词源:
The word "forborne" is the past participle of the verb "forbear," which ultimately derives from Old English *forberan.  This consists of "for-" (meaning "away, off, from") and "beran" (meaning "to bear, carry, endure").  Therefore, the original meaning implied "to bear away from," or "to refrain from." Over time, the meaning evolved to emphasize the patience and restraint involved in such refraining.
