isometric-drawing: /ˌaɪsoʊˈmɛtrɪk ˈdrɔːɪŋ/ | n. |等轴测图 | An isometric drawing is a pictorial representation of an object where three sides of the object can be seen at once, using parallel lines to represent depth, width, and height.  It is a type of axonometric projection where the lines of sight are equally inclined to the three principal axes of the object. Unlike perspective drawings, isometric drawings do not show perspective distortion; parallel lines remain parallel. | Example: The architect presented an isometric drawing of the new building, showing its three dimensions clearly. | 近义词：axonometric projection, pictorial drawing | 反义词：perspective drawing
