/ˌoʊvərwɪðˈhɛld/ | adj. | 过度克制的；过度隐瞒的 |  This word is not a standard English word.  It's a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively) and "withheld" (meaning kept back or suppressed).  Therefore, it implies that something has been excessively or inappropriately suppressed or kept secret.  There's no established dictionary definition or common usage.  It would be understood contextually, based on the meaning of its component parts. | Example: The overwithheld information eventually leaked to the press, causing a scandal.  过度隐瞒的信息最终泄露给了媒体，引发了一场丑闻。| 近义词: excessively suppressed, overly concealed, unduly hidden | 反义词: openly revealed, freely disclosed | adj.
