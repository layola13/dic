The word "haemaphaein" is not a valid English word.  There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries or etymological resources.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word related to hematology (the study of blood) or a less common scientific term.

2. **A neologism or technical term:**  It might be a newly coined word or a term specific to a niche field, not yet widely adopted.  If you encountered this word in a specific context (book, article, etc.), providing that context would help in determining its meaning.

3. **A made-up word:** It might be a fictional word created for a story or game.
