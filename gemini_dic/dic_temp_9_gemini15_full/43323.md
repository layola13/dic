词源:  The word "crammed" is the past participle of the verb "cram," which ultimately derives from the Middle English word "cramen," meaning "to stuff" or "to thrust." This, in turn, is likely related to the Old English word "crammian," with similar meanings.  The sense of filling something tightly evolved over time.
