词源:

The word "pitcher-like" is a compound adjective formed from "pitcher" and the suffix "-like."  "Pitcher" originates from the Old English word "picc," referring to a vessel for liquids. The "-like" suffix adds the meaning of "resembling" or "having the characteristics of."  Therefore, the word combines the concept of a pitcher with the idea of resemblance.
