quasi-respected: /ˈkwɑːzaɪrɪˈspɛktɪd/ | adj. | 勉强受尊敬的，有名无实的受尊敬的 |  The word combines "quasi" meaning "seemingly" or "to a certain extent," and "respected," implying a level of respect that is incomplete or not fully earned. It describes someone or something that receives a degree of respect, but not genuine or complete respect. This might be due to position, reputation, or superficial qualities rather than true merit or achievement.  | Example: He held a quasi-respected position in the company, largely due to his family connections, rather than his actual contributions. 他在公司里担任着一个勉强受尊敬的职位，这主要是因为他的家族关系，而不是他实际的贡献。 | 近义词: nominally respected, superficially admired, partially esteemed | 反义词: highly respected, deeply admired, universally revered |
