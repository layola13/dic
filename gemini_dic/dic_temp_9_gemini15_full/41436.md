词源:
The word "cornet" ultimately derives from the Old French word "cornet," meaning "small horn," which in turn comes from the Latin word "cornu," meaning "horn."  The musical instrument's name reflects its horn-like shape. The ice cream cone usage is a later development, adopting the word due to the shape similarity.
