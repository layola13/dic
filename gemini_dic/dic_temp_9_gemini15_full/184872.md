词源:
The word "retackle" is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "anew") and the verb "tackle," which originally meant to seize or grip, and later came to mean to grapple with a problem or challenge.  The word's evolution reflects a shift in meaning from physical engagement to a more metaphorical handling of difficulties.
