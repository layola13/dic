preaggravated: /ˌpriːˈæɡrəveɪtɪd/ | adj. |  加剧的；恶化的；预先加重的 |  The word "preaggravated" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a blend of "pre-" (meaning before) and "aggravated" (meaning made worse).  While not a dictionary entry, its intended meaning can be inferred. It suggests something that was worsened *before* a particular event or time, implying a prior condition that was exacerbated.  There is no standard usage or grammatical rules to define its structure.  The word is unconventional and should be avoided in formal writing.  Instead, use more precise and established vocabulary to convey the intended meaning. | Example:  The pre-existing injury was preaggravated by the fall. (This sentence uses the word, but it's better to rephrase for clarity.)  |近义词:  pre-existing, worsened, exacerbated, intensified | 反义词:  improved, ameliorated, alleviated | 词性: adjective
