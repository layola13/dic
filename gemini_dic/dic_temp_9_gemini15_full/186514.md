The word "ricking" does not exist as a standalone word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a regional dialect word, a neologism (newly coined word), or a part of a compound word.

To provide helpful information, I need clarification:

1. **Context:** Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the sentence or phrase it's used in will help determine its meaning and possible origin.

2. **Intended meaning:** What do you think the word might mean?  This will help narrow down possibilities.

For example, it could be a misspelling of:

* **wrecking:**  /ˈrɛkɪŋ/ | v. | 破坏，拆毁 |  The storm was wreaking havoc on the coast.  暴风雨正在沿海肆虐。| 近义词：damaging, destroying | 反义词：repairing, constructing

* **rigging:** /ˈrɪɡɪŋ/ | n. | 装备，索具；操纵 | The rigging of the sailboat needs repair. 帆船的索具需要修理。 | 近义词：equipment, tackle | 反义词：dismantling (for equipment)


If you can provide more context, I can offer a more accurate analysis.
