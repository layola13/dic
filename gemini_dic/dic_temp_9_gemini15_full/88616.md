The word "hiyasu" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a loanword or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, further information is needed about the language of origin or intended meaning.  Is it from Japanese, another language, or perhaps a slang term?  Providing context would allow for a more accurate analysis.
