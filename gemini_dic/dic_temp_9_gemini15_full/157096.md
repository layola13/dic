词源:

The word "pinafore" originates from the combination of "pin" and "afore."  "Pin" refers to the pins used to fasten the garment, and "afore" is an archaic word meaning "in front of" or "before."  Therefore, a pinafore was originally a garment pinned in front of another garment, functioning as an apron or protective overlay.  The evolution to its current usage as a type of dress likely occurred because the style of the pinafore dress resembled the pinafore apron in its simple, often sleeveless design.
