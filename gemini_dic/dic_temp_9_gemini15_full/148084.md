词源:
The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great extent) and "sceptically" (derived from "sceptic," meaning a person inclined to doubt or question).  "Sceptic" itself traces back to the Greek word "skeptikos," meaning "inquiring," which evolved to mean "doubtful" in English.
