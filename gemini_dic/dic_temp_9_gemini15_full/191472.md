词源:

The word "schizophrenic" comes from the Greek words "schizo" (σχίζω), meaning "to split," and "phren" (φρήν), meaning "mind" or "diaphragm."  The term was coined by Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in the early 20th century to describe a mental illness characterized by a splitting of the personality or a fragmentation of thought processes.
