词源:
The word "discovered" comes from the Old French word "descouvrir," which means "to uncover."  This word, in turn, is derived from the prefix "des-" (meaning "un-") and the verb "couvrir" (meaning "to cover").  The evolution of the word reflects the act of revealing something that was previously hidden or unknown.
