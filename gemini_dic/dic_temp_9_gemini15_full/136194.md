nonrelaxation: /ˌnɒnˌriːlækˈseɪʃən/ | n. | 非松弛；持续紧张 | The absence of relaxation; a state of continued tension or strain.  It is often used in scientific contexts, particularly in physics and materials science, to describe a system or material that does not relax to a lower energy state. | Example: The nonrelaxation of the polymer chains resulted in increased viscosity.  聚合物链的非松弛导致粘度增加。  | 近义词：tension, strain, rigidity | 反义词：relaxation, ease
