multicircuit's: /ˌmʌltiˈsɜːrkɪts/ | n. |多电路的；多电路系统 | A system involving multiple circuits, often in electronics or telecommunications.  The term usually refers to a network or system with several interconnected circuits working together.  It implies complexity and potentially higher capacity or redundancy than a single circuit. | Example: The multicircuit's failure caused a widespread communication outage. 多电路系统的故障导致了大范围的通讯中断。 |近义词: multichannel, networked, interconnected |反义词: single-circuit, simple circuit |名词
