词源:

The term "dogfight" originated in the early days of aerial combat, likely drawing a comparison between the chaotic, unpredictable nature of air battles and a brawl between dogs.  The imagery of snarling, tumbling canines fighting fiercely mirrors the close-range maneuvering and intense combat that characterizes a dogfight.  The term's figurative use to describe a heated argument or dispute is an extension of this original meaning.
