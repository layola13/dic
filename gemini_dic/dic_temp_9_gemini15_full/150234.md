词源:
The word "pandemonium" originates from the Greek words "pan" (meaning "all") and "daemon" (meaning "demon" or "evil spirit").  In John Milton's epic poem *Paradise Lost*, Pandemonium is the capital of Hell, a place of great noise and confusion.  The word thus acquired its current meaning through association with this fictional location.
