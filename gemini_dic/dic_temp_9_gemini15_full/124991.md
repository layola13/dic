The word "muggurs" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, part of speech, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in your format.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:** Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or looking word?
* **It's a regional dialect word:**  It might be a slang term used in a specific region or community.  If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it might be possible to find its meaning.
* **It's a newly coined word:** It could be a newly invented word, perhaps in a fictional context.
* **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name (of a person, place, or thing) that isn't widely known.

Please provide more information so I can assist you better.
