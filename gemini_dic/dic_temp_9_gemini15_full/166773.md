presocialist: /ˌpriːˈsoʊʃəlɪst/ | adj. | 前社会主义的，准社会主义的 |  Describing a system, ideology, or movement that precedes or is a precursor to full-fledged socialism, often characterized by some socialist tendencies but lacking complete socialist implementation. It might involve some state intervention in the economy or social welfare programs but not full-scale nationalization or collectivization.


英文解析:The term "presocialist" denotes a stage or condition that exists before the complete establishment of a socialist system.  It suggests a transitionary period where elements of socialism are present but the full implementation is yet to be achieved.  It often implies a gradual movement towards socialism, rather than a sudden revolution.
