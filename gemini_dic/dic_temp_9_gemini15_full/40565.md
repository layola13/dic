WORD ORIGIN->
The word "contumaciousnesses" is derived from the Latin word "contumax," meaning "stubborn," "obstinate," or "rebellious."  The suffix "-ious" forms an adjective ("contumacious"), meaning "stubbornly disobedient."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun ("contumaciousness"), signifying the quality or state of being contumacious. The addition of "-es" creates the plural form, indicating multiple instances of such behavior.

USAGE->  This word is relatively rare in everyday conversation. Its usage is primarily found in legal and formal contexts where repeated acts of defiance are being described.  Given its infrequent use, there are no specific tense conjugations or grammatical constructions exclusive to "contumaciousnesses."  The grammatical usage follows standard plural noun rules.  

PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "contumaciousnesses." The word itself is a rarely used plural noun.  Phrases would be built around describing the acts of contumacy, rather than using the word directly in a phrase. For example, one might use phrases such as:  "acts of contumaciousness," "repeated instances of contumacy," "a pattern of defiant behavior," or "stubborn refusal to comply."
