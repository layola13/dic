/nɒnˌkɔːzəˈteɪtɪvnəsɪz/ | n. |非致因性；非因果关系的性质 |The study focused on the noncausativenesses of certain phenomena, exploring factors beyond simple cause-and-effect relationships.|  |无|无|名词


This word is extremely rare and not found in standard dictionaries.  It's a highly derived word, formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" (pluralizing an abstract noun) to "noncausativeness."  Let's break down the components:

* **non-**: prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of"
* **causative**: adjective referring to something that causes something else; related to cause and effect.
* **-ness**: suffix that turns an adjective into a noun, denoting a state, quality, or condition.
* **-es**: plural suffix indicating more than one instance of the quality.

Therefore, "noncausativenesses" refers to multiple instances or aspects of something *not* being caused by something else. It highlights the absence of causal relationships, or the presence of multiple instances of this absence.


Because of its rarity and highly specialized nature, providing usage examples in various grammatical tenses and phrases is impractical.  The word would primarily appear in highly academic contexts, possibly within philosophy, linguistics, or specialized scientific fields discussing complex systems where straightforward cause-and-effect is not always apparent.  The word itself is so complex that it is likely to be avoided in favor of clearer, more concise phrasing in most situations.
