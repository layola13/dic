ductilenesses:/dʌkˈtaɪlənəsɪz/| n.|展性；延展性；韧性|The ability of a material to be drawn out into a thin wire or hammered into a thin sheet without breaking.  It refers to the property of a substance to undergo significant plastic deformation before rupture.  This property is crucial in various manufacturing processes involving metal shaping and forming.|例句：The ductilenesses of copper makes it ideal for wiring. 铜的延展性使其成为理想的接线材料。

The high ductilenesses of gold allows for intricate jewelry designs. 金的高延展性允许制作复杂的珠宝设计。|近义词：malleability, plasticity, flexibility|反义词：brittleness, rigidity
