词源:  The word "delint" is a combination of the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove") and "lint" (meaning "small fibers or fluff").  Therefore, it literally means "to remove lint."  It's a relatively modern coinage, likely arising in the 20th century with the increased use of textiles and the need for methods to remove lint.
