refractometer:/rɪˌfræˈkɒmɪtər/| n. |折射计|An instrument for measuring the refractive index of a substance, often used to determine the concentration of a solution.  A refractometer works by measuring how much light bends as it passes through a substance.  The amount of bending is directly related to the concentration of dissolved solids in the substance.|Example: The chemist used a refractometer to determine the sugar concentration in the syrup. 化学家用折射计测定糖浆中的糖浓度。|近义词：refractometric instrument|反义词：无
