WORD ORIGIN->

Dictamen derives from the Late Latin word "dictāmen," a noun meaning "dictation," "something dictated," or "opinion."  This in turn comes from the verb "dictāre," meaning "to dictate" or "to say," which has roots in the Proto-Indo-European root "*deik-", meaning "to show" or "to point out."  Therefore, the core meaning of "dictamen" relates to something formally stated or pronounced.
