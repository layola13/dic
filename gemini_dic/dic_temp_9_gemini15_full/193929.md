self-emptiness: /ˌsɛlfˈɛmptɪnɛs/ | n. | 自我空虚；空无自我；解脱 |

英文解析:Self-emptiness refers to a state of being where the individual's ego or sense of self is minimized or absent.  It's often associated with spiritual practices and philosophies that aim to transcend the limitations of the personal self.  This doesn't necessarily mean a lack of feeling or experience, but rather a shift in perspective where the self is not the primary focus or point of identification.  The concept varies in meaning depending on the philosophical or religious context.  In some traditions, it is a desired state of enlightenment or liberation, while in others, it might be viewed as a temporary state or a stage on a spiritual path.
