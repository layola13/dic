quasi-neutrally:/ˈkwɑːziˌnjuːtrəli/ | adv. | 准中性地；近似中性地 |  Approaching or resembling neutrality; almost neutral.  It implies a state that is not perfectly neutral but exhibits characteristics close to neutrality.  | Example: The solution remained quasi-neutrally charged after the reaction.  溶液反应后保持着近似中性的电荷。 | 近义词: near-neutrally, almost neutrally | 反义词: strongly charged, highly polarized
