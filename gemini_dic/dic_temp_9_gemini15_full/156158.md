phototrophy:/foʊtəˈtrɒfi/| n. |光养 | The ability of an organism to use light to generate energy.  Phototrophs use light as their primary energy source, converting light energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis.  They are crucial to many ecosystems, forming the base of the food chain. | Example:  Cyanobacteria are a type of phototrophic bacteria that play a significant role in global carbon cycling.  蓝细菌是一种光养细菌，在全球碳循环中发挥着重要作用。  |近义词:photosynthesis (process), light-dependent metabolism |反义词:chemotrophy
