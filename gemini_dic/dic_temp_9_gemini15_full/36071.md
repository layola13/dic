英文解析：

Coefficient refers to a numerical or constant quantity placed before and multiplying the variable in an algebraic expression (e.g., the 3 in 3x).  It can also more broadly refer to a factor or element contributing to a result, often in a collaborative or synergistic way.  In physics and engineering, it might describe the proportionality between two related quantities.
