Word Origin:

The word is a combination of:

* **hyper-:**  A prefix meaning "excessive," "beyond," or "above."
* **mystical:** Relating to mysticism, a belief in direct communication with God or ultimate reality.
* **-ness:** A suffix forming nouns of state, quality, or condition.

Therefore, "hypermysticalness" literally means the state or quality of being excessively or extremely mystical.
