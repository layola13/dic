词源:
The word "favor" comes from the Old French word "favor," meaning "appearance, countenance, good graces."  It ultimately derives from the Latin word "favor," meaning "favor, kindness, good will."  The evolution of the word shows a shift from its original meaning of appearance to its current meanings of kindness, preference, and assistance.
