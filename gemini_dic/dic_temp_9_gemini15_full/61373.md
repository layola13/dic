词源:

The word "embittering" comes from the verb "embitter," which is formed from the prefix "em-" (meaning "to make" or "to cause to be") and the word "bitter."  "Bitter" itself has Old English roots, stemming from "biter," meaning "sharp, pungent." The evolution suggests a progression from a literal sense of a sharp, unpleasant taste to a figurative sense of resentment and unhappiness.
