词源:
The word "maverick" originates from the name of Samuel Maverick, a 19th-century Texas rancher who was known for not branding his cattle.  Because his unbranded cattle were easily identifiable as belonging to no one in particular, "maverick" came to be applied to anyone independent and unconventional.
