indophenol:/ɪnˈdɒfɪnɒl/| n. |靛酚|Indophenol is a generic name for a group of chemical compounds that are derivatives of phenols and contain an indigo-like chromophore.  They are often used as redox indicators in titrations and in analytical chemistry. |Example: The indophenol blue method is commonly used to determine the amount of ammonia in a sample.  靛酚蓝法常用于测定样品中氨的含量。|近义词：None directly equivalent, but other redox indicators could be considered. |反义词：None directly opposite.|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The indophenol solution changes color during the titration. = 滴定过程中靛酚溶液会变色。
We use indophenol as an indicator in this experiment. = 在这个实验中，我们使用靛酚作为指示剂。


一般过去时:

将来时:
We will use indophenol to determine the concentration of the analyte. = 我们将使用靛酚来测定分析物的浓度。
The experiment will require a specific concentration of indophenol. = 该实验需要特定浓度的靛酚。


虚拟语气:
If we had more indophenol, we could perform more tests. = 如果我们有更多靛酚，我们可以进行更多测试。
It would be helpful if the indophenol solution was freshly prepared. = 如果靛酚溶液是新配制的，那就太好了。


被动语态:
The indophenol was added dropwise to the sample. = 靛酚逐滴添加到样品中。
