词源:

The word "leggings" ultimately derives from the Old French word  "leggin," meaning a "covering for the leg."  This in turn has roots in the Old Norse word "leggr," meaning "leg".  The modern English plural form "leggings" developed as a direct descendant of these earlier forms, reflecting a shift in usage from singular to plural to refer to a pair of leg coverings.
