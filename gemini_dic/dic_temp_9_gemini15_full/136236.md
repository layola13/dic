词源:

The word "nonrenewable" is a compound word.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "renewable" comes from the verb "renew," meaning "to make new again."  Therefore, "nonrenewable" means "not able to be made new again."  The root of "renew" traces back to Old French "renouveller," ultimately from Latin "re-" (again) + "novus" (new).
