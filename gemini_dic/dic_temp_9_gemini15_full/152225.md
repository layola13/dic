词源:
源自拉丁语 *patronus (保护人) + -ation (名词后缀)，表示“保护的行为或状态”。  The word "patron" itself has a long history, stemming from the Roman concept of a *patronus*, a powerful individual who offered protection and support to a *cliens* (client).  This relationship was often reciprocal, with the *cliens* offering loyalty and services in return.
