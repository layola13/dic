词源:

The word "incomprehensiblenesses" is derived from the adjective "incomprehensible," which itself is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), "comprehensible" (meaning "understandable"), and the suffix "-nesses" (forming a plural noun indicating multiple instances of a quality or state).  "Comprehend" ultimately comes from the Latin "comprehendere," meaning "to grasp" or "to understand."  Therefore, "incomprehensiblenesses" literally means "the multiple states or instances of being not understandable."
