词源:
The word "laugh" has Old English roots, stemming from the Proto-Germanic *hlahjan.  Its evolution reflects a common Germanic ancestor, with cognates appearing in other Germanic languages.  The sound symbolism of the word, with its repetitive 'l' and 'gh' sounds, likely contributes to its onomatopoeic quality, mimicking the sound of laughter itself.
