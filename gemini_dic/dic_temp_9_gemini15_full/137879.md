PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "nonviscidnesses" due to its rarity.  Phrases would need to be constructed around the concept of non-viscosity.  For example:

lack of nonviscidnesses (lack of non-viscosity)
degree of nonviscidnesses (degree of non-viscosity)
measurement of nonviscidnesses (measurement of non-viscosity)
properties of nonviscidnesses (properties of non-viscosity)

WORD ORIGIN->

The word "nonviscidnesses" is derived from:

* **non-**: a prefix meaning "not"
* **viscid**:  from Latin "viscidus," meaning "sticky," "glutinous."
* **-ness**: a suffix forming abstract nouns denoting quality, state, or condition.  (e.g., happiness, sadness)
* **-es**: plural suffix


Therefore, "nonviscidnesses" literally means "the states or qualities of not being sticky or viscous," referring to the absence of viscosity in multiple instances.
