dioptre: /ˈdaɪɒptər/ | n. |屈光度；度数 | A unit of refractive power of a lens or optical system, equal to the reciprocal of the focal length in meters.  It is used to measure the strength of corrective lenses for eyeglasses and contact lenses.  A higher dioptre number indicates a stronger lens. |例句：His prescription calls for +2.0 dioptres in each eye.他的处方要求每只眼睛都用+2.0屈光度。  The optician measured the dioptres needed to correct her vision.验光师测量了她矫正视力所需的屈光度。|近义词：power (in the context of lenses)|反义词：None specifically, but a negative dioptre value represents a different type of correction than a positive value.
