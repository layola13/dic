词源:  The term's origin is uncertain, but it's believed to be a combination of "Johnnie" (a common name, used generically) and "come lately," highlighting the recency of the person's arrival or involvement.  The implication of arrogance and lack of respect for established norms is inherent in the term's usage.  The precise etymology remains elusive, with no definitive historical record pinpointing its first use.
