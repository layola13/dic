词源:
The word "pre-eclamptic" is derived from the combining form "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in front of") and the word "eclamptic," which itself comes from the Greek word "eklampsia," meaning "a sudden outburst or flash."  The "eklampsia" referred to the seizures that can be a complication of the condition.  Therefore, "pre-eclamptic" literally means "before eclampsia" or "in the stage before eclampsia,"  reflecting the fact that pre-eclampsia can sometimes progress to eclampsia if left untreated.
