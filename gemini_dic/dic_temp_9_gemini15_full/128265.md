词源:
The word "neuronet" is a blend of "neuron" and "network."  "Neuron" comes from the Greek word "νεῦρον" (neuron), meaning "nerve," referring to the fundamental unit of the nervous system. "Network" comes from the Old English word "netweorc," a combination of "net" and "weorc" (work), signifying an interconnected system. Therefore, "neuronet" literally means a network of neurons, mirroring the structure of a biological nervous system.
