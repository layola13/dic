词源:

The word "misericordia" is of Latin origin.  It's derived from "misericors," meaning "merciful," which itself is a compound of "miseri" (wretched, pitiful) and "cor" (heart). Thus, the literal meaning is "having a pitiful heart."  The "-ia" suffix is a noun-forming suffix, creating a noun from the adjective "misericors".  Over time, it passed into various Romance languages before being adopted (less commonly now) into English.


用法说明:

While "misericordia" is a valid English word, it is considered archaic and rarely used in modern English.  Its use is mostly confined to specialized contexts, such as religious or literary works where a more formal and elevated tone is desired.  It's more commonly found in older texts.  Modern English equivalents, such as "mercy," "compassion," or "pity," are preferred in everyday speech and writing.  The word often appears in the context of religious supplication or appeals for forgiveness.
