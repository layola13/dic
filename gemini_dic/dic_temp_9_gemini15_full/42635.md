词源:
The word "counterseal" is a compound word. "Counter" means "opposite" or "in opposition to" and "seal" refers to a mark or stamp used to authenticate a document.  Therefore, a counterseal is a second seal added to verify the authenticity of the first seal.  The word's origins trace back to the Middle English word "countreseal" and ultimately to the Old French "contreseler".
