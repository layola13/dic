词源:

The word is derived from:

* **in-**: a prefix meaning "not" or "without"
* **defensible**:  from "defend" (Old French *defendre, from Latin *dēfendere, from *dē- "away, off" + *fendere "to strike, cleave")  meaning capable of being defended
* **-ness**: a suffix forming nouns of state or quality
* **-es**:  plural suffix


Therefore, "indefensiblenesses" literally means "the states or qualities of being not defensible,"  or multiple instances of such a state.
