The word "reezed" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a regional dialect word, or a newly coined word with limited usage.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered "reezed."  For example, is it from a specific book, song, or conversation?  Knowing the context would allow me to determine the intended word and provide the requested analysis.
