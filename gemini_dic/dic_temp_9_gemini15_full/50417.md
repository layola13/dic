词源:
Deprivation comes from the verb "deprive," which originates from the Old French word "depriver," meaning "to take away from," "to rob," or "to divest."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "privare," meaning "to deprive" or "to rob."  The suffix "-ation" forms a noun, indicating the act or process of depriving.
