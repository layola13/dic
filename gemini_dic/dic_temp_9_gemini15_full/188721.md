词源:
The word "rung" ultimately comes from the Old English word *hringan, meaning "ring" or "circle". This reflects the circular shape of many early ladder rungs. Over time, the meaning shifted to refer specifically to the horizontal bars of a ladder, and then broadened to include metaphorical "rungs" representing levels or stages of progress.
