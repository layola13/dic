词源:
The word "revile" comes from the Old French word "reviler," meaning "to call names," which in turn derives from the Vulgar Latin *rivilāre.  The ultimate origin is uncertain, but likely relates to a verb meaning "to turn back" or "to retort," suggesting the act of responding with harsh criticism.
