词源:

The word "psychopathic" is derived from "psychopathy," which itself combines "psycho-" (from Greek *psykhē*, meaning "mind, soul, spirit") and "-pathy" (from Greek *-patheia*, meaning "suffering, feeling, disease").  Therefore, "psychopathy" literally means "mental illness" or "disease of the mind," specifically referring to a personality disorder characterized by a lack of empathy, remorse, and antisocial behavior.  "-ic" is an adjectival suffix.
