PHRASE->
(Due to the relatively new and specific nature of "penthousing," common phrases are limited.  The following uses "penthouse" instead, focusing on related concepts):

Penthouse suite: 顶层套房
Penthouse view: 顶层公寓景观
Penthouse living: 顶层公寓生活
Penthouse apartment: 顶层公寓
Luxury penthouse: 豪华顶层公寓

词源:  The word "penthousing" is a relatively recent coinage, derived from "penthouse," which itself is a combination of "pent" (meaning enclosed or confined, from Old French) and "house."  The "-ing" suffix transforms it into a gerund, signifying the act of living in or utilizing a penthouse.
