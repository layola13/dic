词源：

The word "fordone" is a past participle of the now-obsolete verb "fordo," meaning "to undo," "to ruin," or "to destroy."  The prefix "for-" intensifies the meaning of the verb "do." Over time, "fordone" evolved to also mean "completely finished" or "exhausted," reflecting a state of being completely undone or worn out.  The original sense of ruin or destruction is still present in its usage.
