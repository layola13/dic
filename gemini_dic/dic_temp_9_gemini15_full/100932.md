The word "inuktituut" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a misspelling or a word from Inuktitut, an Inuit language.  Therefore, a standard English word analysis is not possible.  To provide a helpful response, more context is needed.  Is this word from a specific source?  What is the intended meaning?  With additional information, I can attempt to provide a more accurate analysis, potentially including a phonetic transcription if the pronunciation is known.
