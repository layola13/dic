The word "inlive" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specific jargon or dialect.  To provide an analysis, I need clarification on its intended meaning and context.
