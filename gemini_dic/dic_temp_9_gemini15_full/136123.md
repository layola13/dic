词源:

The word is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the word "refillable".  "Refillable" is derived from the verb "refill," which itself comes from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the verb "fill."  Therefore, "nonrefillable" literally means "not able to be filled again."
