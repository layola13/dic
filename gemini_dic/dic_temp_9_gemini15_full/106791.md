labialization:/ˌleɪbiəlaɪˈzeɪʃən/| n. |唇化；唇音化 |The modification of a sound by rounding the lips.  It is a common articulatory feature in many languages, affecting vowels and consonants alike. For example, the English vowel /u/ as in "too" is labialized, while the consonant /w/ is inherently labialized. |Example: The pronunciation of the /ʃ/ sound in French often involves labialization, making it sound slightly different from the English equivalent. 法语中/ʃ/音的发音通常包含唇化，使其听起来与英语的等价物略有不同。|近义词：rounding of the lips|反义词：unrounding of the lips


Etymology:
The word "labialization" is derived from the Latin word "labialis," meaning "of the lip,"  which in turn comes from "labium," meaning "lip." The suffix "-ization" indicates the process of making something into something else or the state of being something.
