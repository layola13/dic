epigenetic:/ˌɛpɪdʒɛˈnɛtɪk/ | adj. |表观遗传学的；表观遗传的 | Relating to or denoting heritable changes in gene expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence.  Epigenetic changes are caused by modifications to the chromatin structure, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, that affect gene expression without changing the DNA sequence itself. These modifications can be passed down through cell divisions and, in some cases, across generations. | Example:  Epigenetic modifications play a crucial role in development and disease. 表观遗传修饰在发育和疾病中起着至关重要的作用。 | 近义词：heritable, inheritable | 反义词：genetic (in the context of changes to DNA sequence) |
