ptyxis:/ˈtɪksɪs/| n. |叶的折叠方式；褶皱|The arrangement or folding of leaves in a bud.  The term is used primarily in botany and describes the various ways leaves are folded within a bud before they unfold.  This can include various patterns such as convolute, conduplicate, involute, revolute, etc.  Understanding ptyxis is important for plant identification and classification. | Example: The ptyxis of the magnolia bud is conduplicate, meaning the leaf halves are folded together along the midrib.  = 玉兰花芽的叶片折叠方式是叠合式的，这意味着叶片的两半沿中脉折叠在一起。|近义词：leaf folding, vernation (though vernation is a broader term)|反义词：无
