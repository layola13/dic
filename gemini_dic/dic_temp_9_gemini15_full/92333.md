词源:

The word "hypnotizing" derives from "hypnosis," which ultimately comes from the Greek word "hypnos," meaning "sleep."  The suffix "-izing" indicates the process or act of causing something.  Therefore, "hypnotizing" means the act of inducing a hypnotic state or captivating someone's attention.
