词源:
The word "pilaf" ultimately derives from the Persian word پلو (polo), which means "cooked rice".  Through various linguistic transformations and borrowings (including Turkish pilav and Arabic pilaw), it entered European languages in its current form.  The core meaning of cooked rice remains consistent throughout its historical evolution.
