faculae:/ˈfækjʊliː/| n.|太阳表面的光斑|Bright patches on the sun's surface, appearing brighter than the surrounding photosphere due to higher temperature. They are associated with strong magnetic fields and are often found in groups.  |Example:  Observations of solar faculae provide valuable information about solar activity.  太阳光斑的观测为我们提供了关于太阳活动的有价值的信息。 |近义词：sunspots (although faculae are brighter and associated with different magnetic field structures) |反义词：N/A
