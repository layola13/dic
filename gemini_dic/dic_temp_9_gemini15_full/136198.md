词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "relenting," which means "to become less severe or intense."  Therefore, "nonrelenting" means "not becoming less severe or intense."  The root of "relenting" can be traced back to the Old English word "lenctan," meaning "to yield" or "to soften."
