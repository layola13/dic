/ˌoʊvərˈplɛntɪfəlˌnɛsɪz/ | n. | 过剩；过多；富余 | The word "overplentifulnesses" is a rare and somewhat awkward formation.  It is the plural of "overplentifulness," which itself is formed by adding the prefix "over-" to "plentifulness."  It refers to multiple instances of an excessive abundance or surplus of something. The word is rarely used in modern English due to its clumsiness; simpler alternatives exist. | The farm experienced several overplentifulnesses this year, resulting in surplus produce that couldn't be sold.  今年农场经历了几次丰收过剩，导致多余的农产品无法出售。 | abundance, superfluity, plethora | scarcity, deficiency, shortage | 名词
