gradients:/ˈɡreɪdiənts/| n.|梯度；倾斜度；渐变；坡度|The rate of change of a quantity; the slope of a line or curve.  It can also refer to a gradual change in color or tone.|例句：The map shows the gradients of the terrain. 这张地图显示了地形的坡度。

例句：The image features a subtle gradient from light blue to dark blue. 这张图片展现了从浅蓝色到深蓝色的微妙渐变。


近义词：slope, incline, gradient, grade, inclination


反义词：level, flat, even


词性：名词


词源:  The word "gradient" comes from the Late Latin word *gradiens*, the present participle of *gradi* meaning "to walk" or "to step". This reflects the idea of a gradual incline or slope.  The suffix "-ent" indicates a present participle or agent noun.
