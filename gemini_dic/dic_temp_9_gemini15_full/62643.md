词源:

The word "enfranchisement" comes from the Old French word "enfraunchisement," which itself is derived from "franchise," meaning "freedom from restraint; liberty."  The prefix "en-" indicates "to put into" or "to cause to be."  Therefore, the word literally means "to put into freedom," or "to grant freedom."
