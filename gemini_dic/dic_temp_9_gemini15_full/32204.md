词源:

The word "Chicana" is derived from "Chicano," a term used by Mexican Americans to refer to themselves, particularly those who are politically active and identify with their Mexican heritage.  "Chicano" itself is a variant spelling of "Mexicano," reflecting a reclamation of identity and a rejection of imposed Anglo-American cultural norms.  The feminine form, "Chicana," emerged alongside the Chicano movement to specifically represent women within that community.
