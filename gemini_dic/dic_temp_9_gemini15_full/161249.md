postmating:/ˌpoʊstˈmeɪtɪŋ/| n. |交配后行为，交配后过程|The term "postmating" refers to the behaviors and processes that occur after mating has taken place, encompassing various aspects of reproduction, such as sperm competition, cryptic female choice, and parental care.|Example:  Studies on postmating behavior often focus on the interactions between males and females after copulation.|近义词：post-copulatory behavior, after-mating process|反义词：premating, before mating
