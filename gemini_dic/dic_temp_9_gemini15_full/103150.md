词源：The term "gerrymandering" is derived from the name of Elbridge Gerry, the governor of Massachusetts in 1812.  Gerry, along with a group of his supporters, redrew the state’s electoral districts in a way that favored his party, the Democratic-Republicans.  A political cartoonist depicted one of these oddly shaped districts as a salamander, leading to the term "Gerry-mander," which later evolved into "gerrymandering."
