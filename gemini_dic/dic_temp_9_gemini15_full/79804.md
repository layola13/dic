PHRASE->
blood glycocholate (血液甘氨胆酸盐),  glycocholate concentration (甘氨胆酸盐浓度),  glycocholate synthesis (甘氨胆酸盐合成),  fecal glycocholate (粪便甘氨胆酸盐),  hepatic glycocholate (肝脏甘氨胆酸盐)


词源:
Glycocholate is derived from "glyco-" (meaning sugar or sweet) and "cholate" (referring to cholic acid, a bile acid).  The "cholic acid" component originates from the Greek word "chole" (χολή), meaning bile.  Therefore, the name reflects the composition of the molecule, indicating a bile acid conjugated with a sugar-like component.
