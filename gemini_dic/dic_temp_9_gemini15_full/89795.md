hormogonium:/ˌhɔːrməˈɡoʊniəm/| n. | 藻殖段；分枝；菌丝段 | A hormogonium is a short, motile filament of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) that breaks off from a parent filament and functions as a reproductive unit.  It's a type of vegetative reproduction, meaning it doesn't involve sexual processes. Hormogonia are typically formed under stressful conditions or when resources are limited, allowing the cyanobacteria to disperse and colonize new areas. | Example:  The hormogonia of *Anabaena* are easily identifiable under a microscope due to their characteristic shape and movement. = *鱼腥藻*的藻殖段在显微镜下很容易识别，因为它们具有独特的形状和运动方式。|近义词:fragment, propagule |反义词: N/A


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The hormogonium moves towards the light. = 藻殖段向光移动。
This species produces many hormogonia. = 这个物种产生许多藻殖段。


一般过去时:
The hormogonium detached from the filament. = 藻殖段从丝状体上脱落。
Researchers observed the hormogonium's movement. = 研究人员观察了藻殖段的运动。


现在完成时:
The hormogonium has dispersed to a new location. = 藻殖段已经分散到新的位置。
The cyanobacteria have formed numerous hormogonia. = 蓝细菌已经形成了许多藻殖段。


过去完成时:
The hormogonium had already settled before the researchers arrived. = 在研究人员到达之前，藻殖段已经定居了。
The filament had released several hormogonia prior to the experiment. = 在实验之前，丝状体已经释放了几个藻殖段。


将来时:
The hormogonium will likely colonize the new substrate. = 藻殖段很可能会在新的基质上定殖。
The researchers will observe the hormogonium's growth. = 研究人员将观察藻殖段的生长。


虚拟语气:
If the hormogonium had more nutrients, it would grow faster. = 如果藻殖段有更多的营养，它会长得更快。
I wish the hormogonium's movement was easier to track. = 我希望藻殖段的运动更容易追踪。


被动语态:
The hormogonium was observed under the microscope. = 藻殖段在显微镜下被观察到。
The hormogonia were produced in response to stress. = 藻殖段是为应对压力而产生的。


疑问句:
How long does it take for the hormogonium to develop? = 藻殖段发育需要多长时间？
What triggers the formation of hormogonia? = 什么会触发藻殖段的形成？


否定句:
The hormogonium did not survive the drought. = 藻殖段没有在干旱中存活下来。
This species does not produce motile hormogonia. = 这个物种不产生可移动的藻殖段。
