The word "fulgurata" is derived from the Latin word "fulgur," meaning "lightning" or "flash of lightning."  The suffix "-ata" is a feminine past participle suffix,  often indicating a characteristic or state. Therefore, "fulgurata" literally means "struck by lightning" or "having the appearance of lightning," referring to the bright, streaky patterns resembling flashes of light.
