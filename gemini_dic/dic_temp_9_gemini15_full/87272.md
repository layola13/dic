词源:

The word "hermaphrodite" comes from Hermaphroditus, a figure in Greek mythology. Hermaphroditus was the son of Hermes (the messenger god) and Aphrodite (the goddess of love).  According to the myth, he merged with a nymph named Salmacis, becoming a being with both male and female characteristics.  The word entered English in the 16th century.
