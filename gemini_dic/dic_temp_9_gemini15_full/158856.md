The word "plummest" is the superlative form of the adjective "plum," referring to plums that are ripe and full.  The "-est" suffix indicates the superlative degree, meaning "most."  The word's origin traces back to the Old English word "plumme," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "prunus," meaning plum tree.
