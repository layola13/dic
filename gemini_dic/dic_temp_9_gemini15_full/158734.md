The word "plowshares" is a compound noun.  "Plow" comes from Old English *plōh, related to Old High German *pflug and Old Norse *plǫgr. The meaning is related to the act of digging or ploughing.  "Shares" refers to the cutting parts of the plow.  It comes from Old English *scearu, related to Old Frisian *skēre and Old Saxon *scēri.  The modern meaning is closely tied to the plow's function of cutting and turning the earth.  The combined term "plowshares" thus directly describes the cutting blades of a plow.  The metaphorical usage, associating plowshares with peace, comes from Isaiah 2:4, "And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more."  This biblical verse has made "plowshares" a powerful symbol of peace and the redirection of resources from war to peaceful endeavors.
