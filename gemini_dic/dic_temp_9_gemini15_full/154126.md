perihelion: /pɛrɪˈhiːliən/ | n. |近日点 | The point in the orbit of a planet, asteroid, or comet at which it is closest to the sun.  | Example: Earth reaches perihelion in early January. 地球在1月初到达近日点。 |近义词: perigee (for Earth's orbit around the moon) | 反义词: aphelion


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The Earth is at perihelion in January.  = 地球在一月份位于近日点。
Mercury's perihelion is much closer to the sun than Earth's. = 水星的近日点比地球的近日点离太阳近得多。


一般过去时:
The comet reached perihelion last week. = 这颗彗星上周到达了近日点。
The spacecraft passed perihelion without incident. = 宇宙飞船顺利通过近日点。


现在完成时:
The spacecraft has already passed perihelion. = 宇宙飞船已经通过近日点了。
Scientists have observed many comets at perihelion. = 科学家们已经观测到许多彗星在近日点。


过去完成时:
The comet had already passed perihelion before we could observe it. =在我们能够观测到这颗彗星之前，它就已经通过近日点了。
By the time the mission ended, the probe had completed several perihelion passes. = 任务结束时，探测器已经完成了多次近日点通过。


将来时:
The probe will reach perihelion next month. = 探测器下个月将到达近日点。
The comet will be at perihelion in the coming weeks. = 这颗彗星将在接下来的几周内到达近日点。


虚拟语气:
If the spacecraft reached perihelion sooner, we could collect more data. =如果宇宙飞船更早到达近日点，我们就能收集到更多数据。
It would be amazing if we could observe a comet at perihelion. = 如果我们能够在近日点观测到一颗彗星，那就太棒了。


被动语态:
Perihelion was reached by the spacecraft yesterday.  = 宇宙飞船昨天到达了近日点。
The perihelion passage was carefully monitored by scientists. = 科学家们仔细监测了近日点通过。


疑问句:
When will the comet reach perihelion? = 彗星什么时候到达近日点？
At what distance from the sun does the planet reach perihelion? = 这颗行星在距离太阳多远的地方到达近日点？


否定句:
The comet did not reach perihelion as expected. = 彗星没有按预期到达近日点。
The spacecraft did not pass through perihelion successfully. = 宇宙飞船没有成功通过近日点。


PHRASE->
perihelion distance = 近日点距离
perihelion passage = 近日点通过
perihelion precession = 近日点进动
perihelion argument = 近日点幅角
at perihelion = 在近日点
