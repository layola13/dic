词源:

The word "plaguers" derives from the noun "plague," meaning a contagious bacterial disease, typically bubonic plague,  characterized by fever, delirium, and swollen lymph nodes.  The suffix "-er" is an agent noun suffix, indicating the doer of the action. Therefore, "plaguers" literally means those who cause or spread plagues.  The figurative usage extends this meaning to anyone causing widespread trouble or annoyance.
