词源:
The word "flattie" is a colloquial shortening of "flatfish," referring to the flattened body shape of these fish.  "Flatfish" itself comes from "flat" (meaning level or even) and "fish".  The term is descriptive and doesn't have a complex etymological history beyond its straightforward descriptive nature.
