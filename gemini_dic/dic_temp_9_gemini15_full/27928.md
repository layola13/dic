cantilever:/ˈkæntɪliːvər/ | n. |悬臂，悬臂梁 | A cantilever is a structural element, such as a beam, that extends horizontally and is supported at only one end.  It is designed to withstand loads primarily through bending stress.  | Example: The bridge's design incorporated a series of cantilevers to span the wide river.  这座桥的设计包含一系列悬臂来跨越宽阔的河流。|近义词：bracket, overhang |反义词：N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The cantilever supports the balcony. = 悬臂支撑着阳台。
This cantilever beam carries a significant load. = 这根悬臂梁承受着很大的载荷。


一般过去时:
The old cantilever collapsed under the weight of the snow. = 旧的悬臂在雪的重量下坍塌了。
Engineers inspected the damaged cantilever. = 工程师们检查了受损的悬臂。


现在完成时:
The construction crew has installed the new cantilever. = 建筑队已经安装了新的悬臂。
They have reinforced the existing cantilever to increase its load-bearing capacity. = 他们加固了现有的悬臂以提高其承重能力。


过去完成时:
The bridge had already developed a crack in its main cantilever before the storm hit. = 在暴风雨来临之前，桥梁的主要悬臂已经出现裂缝。
The engineers had warned about the instability of the cantilever for years. = 工程师们多年来一直警告悬臂的不稳定性。


将来时:
The architect will design a new cantilever for the building extension. = 建筑师将为建筑物扩建设计一个新的悬臂。
They will install the cantilever next week. = 他们下周将安装悬臂。


虚拟语气:
If the cantilever were stronger, it wouldn't have collapsed. = 如果悬臂更坚固，它就不会坍塌了。
It would be dangerous if the cantilever failed under stress. = 如果悬臂在压力下失效，将非常危险。


被动语态:
The cantilever was designed by a renowned engineer. = 悬臂是由一位著名的工程师设计的。
The damaged cantilever is being repaired. = 受损的悬臂正在维修中。


疑问句:
Is this a cantilever structure? = 这是悬臂结构吗？
How long is the cantilever? = 悬臂有多长？


否定句:
The structure isn't a simple cantilever. = 该结构不是简单的悬臂结构。
That beam doesn't function as a cantilever. = 那根梁不能作为悬臂使用。
