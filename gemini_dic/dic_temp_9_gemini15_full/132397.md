* **non-:**  prefix meaning "not"
* **demonstrative:**  adjective meaning "showing feelings openly"  This word itself comes from the verb "demonstrate," meaning to show clearly, which ultimately derives from the Latin *demonstrare* ("to point out," from *de-* "down" + *monstrare* "to show").


用法说明:


This word is primarily used as an adjective to describe people or their behavior. It emphasizes the lack of outward display of emotion, often implying a reserved or controlled personality.  It doesn't necessarily mean the person is *feeling* no emotion, just that they don't express it openly.
