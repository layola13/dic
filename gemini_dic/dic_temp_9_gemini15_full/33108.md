词源:
The word "Christianity" derives from "Christ," which is a Greek transliteration of the Hebrew word "Messiah," meaning "anointed one."  It refers to Jesus of Nazareth, the central figure of the Christian faith.  The suffix "-ianity" indicates a system of belief or doctrine associated with Christ.  Therefore, "Christianity" signifies the religion centered around the life, teachings, and divinity of Jesus Christ.
