词源:
The word "overbearingness" is derived from the adjective "overbearing," which combines the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessive") with the verb "bear" (in the sense of "to endure" or "to tolerate").  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the quality or state of being overbearing.  Therefore, "overbearingness" denotes the state or quality of being excessively domineering, controlling, or arrogant.
