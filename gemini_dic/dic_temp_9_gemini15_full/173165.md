quasi-attempted: /ˈkwɑːzi əˈtɛmptɪd/ | adj. | 近乎未遂的，似曾未遂的 |  Describes an act that comes very close to being an attempt, but falls short due to some crucial element being missing or failing.  It implies an intention to commit a crime or act, but the action itself doesn't reach the threshold of a full attempt. This is a legal term often used to describe incomplete or unsuccessful criminal acts.  | 例句：The court ruled that while his actions were quasi-attempted murder, they did not meet the criteria for a full charge. 法院裁定，虽然他的行为近乎未遂谋杀，但并不符合完整指控的标准。

The defendant's actions, though clearly indicating intent to harm, were deemed quasi-attempted assault because he never actually made physical contact.被告的行为虽然清楚地表明了伤害意图，但由于他从未真正发生肢体接触，因此被认定为近乎未遂袭击。
