The word "nonequabilities" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism, likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  However, we can speculate on its potential meaning and construction:

It seems to be formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") and a word resembling "equabilities".  "Equability" means the state of being even-tempered, steady, or uniform.  Therefore, "nonequabilities" might be intended to mean "the absence of equability," "unevenness," "inconsistencies," or "lack of uniformity."


To provide a response in the requested format, we will analyze a similar, existing word: "inequabilities"
