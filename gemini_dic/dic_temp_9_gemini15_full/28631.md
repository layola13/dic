The word "cargason" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word? Perhaps a word related to cargo, such as "cargo son" (though nonsensical), or a word with a similar sound.  Providing more context where you encountered this word would be helpful.

2. **A neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, a regional dialect term, or slang within a specific community.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **A proper noun:** It could be a name, a place name, or a brand name.

4. **A combination of words:** It might be a blend of two or more existing words, but without context, it's impossible to decipher.


Without further information, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  Please provide the context in which you found this word.
