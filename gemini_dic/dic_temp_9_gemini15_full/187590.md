The word "romble" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis following your requested format is impossible.  It might be:

1. A misspelling of another word.  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "ramble," "rumble," or a similar-sounding word?

2. A neologism (newly coined word), slang, or a word specific to a dialect or niche community.  If this is the case, please provide context so I can better understand its meaning and usage.

3. A proper noun (name of a person, place, or thing).  If so, please provide more information.


To help me provide the analysis you're looking for, please clarify the word's origin and provide any context in which you encountered it.
