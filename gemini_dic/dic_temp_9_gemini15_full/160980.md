词源:
The word "postalize" is derived from the word "postal," which itself comes from "post," ultimately tracing back to the Latin word "posita," meaning "placed" or "positioned."  The suffix "-ize" indicates the act of making something or causing something to become something else.  Therefore, "postalize" literally means "to make something pertain to the post office or postal service."
