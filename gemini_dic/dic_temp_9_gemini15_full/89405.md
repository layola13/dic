homotaxia:/ˌhoʊmoʊˈtæksiə/| n. |同层位; 同期层|The term homotaxy refers to the correspondence in the relative age of rock strata, regardless of their lithological similarity.  It emphasizes the temporal relationship rather than the precise rock types present.  For example, two rock formations might contain similar fossils, indicating they formed during the same geologic period (homotaxis), but they might have very different compositions (lithologies).| The Paleozoic strata in North America and Europe show homotaxy, even though the specific rock types differ significantly.|近义词：correlation (in a temporal sense)|反义词：heterotaxy


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in geology and paleontology. Therefore, grammatical examples in the same way as for "what" are not applicable.  The usage is largely limited to technical descriptions and analyses of geological formations.

Example sentence 1: The study established homotaxy between the Devonian strata of the Appalachian Mountains and those of the Ural Mountains.  = 这项研究确定了阿巴拉契亚山脉和乌拉尔山脉泥盆纪地层的同层位关系。

Example sentence 2:  Despite differing lithologies, homotaxy suggests a similar age for the two formations. = 尽管岩性不同，同层位关系表明这两个地层的年龄相似。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "homotaxy". Its usage is strictly within a technical scientific context.
