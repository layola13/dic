词源:  The word derives from the adjective "impertinent," which comes from the Old French word "impertinent," meaning "irrelevant" or "inappropriate."  This, in turn, comes from the Latin word "impertinens," which is a combination of the prefix "im-" (not) and "pertinens," meaning "pertaining" or "relevant."  The evolution shows a shift in meaning from simply irrelevant to offensively irrelevant or disrespectful.
