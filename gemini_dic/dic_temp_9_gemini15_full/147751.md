词源:
The word "overprogrammed" is a compound word formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the adjective "programmed" (referring to the process of creating a set of instructions for a computer or other machine).  The root "program" comes from the Greek word "programma," meaning "a written notice," which evolved to mean a plan or schedule, and ultimately the instructions for a computer.
