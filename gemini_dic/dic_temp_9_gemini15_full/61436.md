词源:
The word "embonpoint" comes from the French phrase "en bon point," literally translating to "in good condition" or "in good state."  The "en" is a preposition meaning "in," "bon" means "good," and "point" refers to condition or state. Over time, its meaning shifted to specifically describe a desirable physique.
