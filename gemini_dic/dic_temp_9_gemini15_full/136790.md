词源:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not."
* **servile**:  Derived from the Latin word "servus," meaning "slave."  "Servile" originally meant relating to slaves and later came to mean showing excessive deference or submissiveness.
* **-ly**: A suffix forming adverbs from adjectives.  Thus, "nonservilely" means "in a not-servile manner."
