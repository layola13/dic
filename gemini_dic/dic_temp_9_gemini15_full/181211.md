词源:
The word "reinoculating" is formed from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the verb "inoculating."  "Inoculating" comes from the Latin word "inoculare," meaning "to engraft,"  itself derived from "in-" (in) and "oculus" (eye, bud). The original meaning related to grafting buds onto plants,  later extending to the introduction of microorganisms or vaccines into a living organism.
