The word "couplement" is not a commonly used word in modern English.  While dictionaries might list it, its usage is extremely rare.  Therefore, providing extensive grammatical examples as requested for a common word like "what" is not practical or relevant.

**Etymology:**

The word "couplement" is derived from the verb "couple," meaning to join or unite two things. The suffix "-ment" forms nouns of action or state, resulting in "couplement" signifying the act or result of coupling.  Its roots trace back to the Old French "copuler" and ultimately to the Latin "copulare," meaning "to join together."

**Usage:**

Due to its infrequent usage, there are no standard grammatical examples to provide across different tenses or moods.  The word implies a connection or joining, often in a technical or specialized context.  It might be found in older texts or highly technical documentation.  Modern English would typically use synonyms like "connection," "coupling," or "joining" to convey the same meaning.

**Example Sentence (Illustrative, not reflecting common usage):**
