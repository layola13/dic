cross-bedding:/ˈkrɒsˌbedɪŋ/| n. | 交错层理 |  Cross-bedding refers to inclined layers within a stratum and is formed by the movement of sediment by wind or water.  It indicates the direction of the current at the time of deposition. The inclined layers, also known as cross-strata, are often preserved in sedimentary rocks. | Example: The sandstone showed clear evidence of cross-bedding, indicating an ancient river system.  这片砂岩清晰地显示了交错层理，表明这里曾经存在一个古老的河流系统。|近义词：cross-stratification|反义词：planar bedding (平直层理)
