pleuroperitoneum: /ˌplʊroʊˌpɛrɪtəˈniːəm/ | n. | 胸腹膜 | The pleuroperitoneum is the serous membrane that lines the pleural cavity and the peritoneal cavity.  It's a rarely used term, often referring to the combined pleural and peritoneal cavities,  or in some contexts,  the shared embryological origin of these cavities. The term is not frequently used in modern medical terminology, with more precise anatomical terms preferred. | Example: (Due to the rarity of the term, a natural example sentence is difficult to construct.  A fabricated example might be):  "The study focused on the embryological development of the pleuroperitoneum and its subsequent differentiation." | 近义词: pleural cavity, peritoneal cavity (but not a true synonym, as it implies a combined structure) | 反义词: None directly applicable |  词性: noun
