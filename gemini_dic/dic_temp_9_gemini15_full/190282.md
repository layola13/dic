词源:

The word "Saracenic" is derived from "Saracen," an older term used in Europe to refer to the Muslims, especially those of the Arab world. The origin of "Saracen" itself is uncertain, but it's believed to have its roots in the ancient Greek word "Saraceńoi" (Σαρακηνοί), which may have referred to various groups in the Middle East, including Arabs, and possibly even earlier to inhabitants of the Syrian desert.  The term eventually became associated with the Islamic world and its cultural achievements, particularly in Spain and North Africa during the medieval period.  The "-ic" suffix transforms the noun "Saracen" into an adjective, indicating something related to or characteristic of the Saracens.
