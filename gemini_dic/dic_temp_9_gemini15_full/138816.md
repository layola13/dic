反义词：None directly applicable;  antonyms would relate to the opposite of a small meal (e.g., feast, banquet), but these are not true antonyms.


词源:  The word derives from the Old French "none," meaning "noon,"  plus "-cheon," a suffix denoting a small portion or piece.  This reflects the original meaning of a small meal taken around noon.
