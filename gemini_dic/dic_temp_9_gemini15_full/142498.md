osmometry:/ɒzˈmɒmɪtri/| n. |渗透压测定法|The measurement of osmotic pressure; a technique used to determine the molar mass of a solute or the concentration of a solution by measuring the osmotic pressure.  Osmometry is based on the principle that the osmotic pressure of a solution is proportional to the concentration of solute particles. |Example: Osmometry was used to determine the molecular weight of the protein. 渗透压测定法被用来测定蛋白质的分子量。|近义词：tonometry|反义词：无
