overhardy: /ˌoʊvərˈhɑːrdi/ | adj. | 过分强壮的；过于茁壮的；过于旺盛的 | Excessively strong or vigorous; too hardy.  The overhardy growth of the weeds choked the young plants. |近义词：exuberant, rampant, luxuriant | 反义词：delicate, frail, weak

英文解析：This word combines "over," meaning "too much" or "excessively," with "hardy," meaning "strong," "robust," or "able to withstand difficult conditions."  Therefore, "overhardy" describes something that is excessively strong, vigorous, or robust, often to a point of being detrimental.  It's not a commonly used word.
