USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't conjugate like verbs.  Therefore, tense considerations (past, present, future, etc.) are not applicable to the word "sexto" itself.  However, the *sentences* in which it is used will be subject to the usual tense rules.  For example:


一般现在时:
He writes a sexto every day. = 他每天都写一首六行诗。
She reads a sexto before bed. = 她睡前读一首六行诗。

一般过去时:
He wrote a sexto yesterday. = 他昨天写了一首六行诗。
She read a sexto last night. = 她昨晚读了一首六行诗。

现在完成时:
He has written many sextos. = 他已经写了很多六行诗。
She has read several sextos this week. = 她本周读了几首六行诗。

过去完成时:
He had written a sexto before the competition. = 他在比赛前写了一首六行诗。
She had read the sexto twice before analyzing it. = 在分析这首六行诗之前，她已经读了两遍。

将来时:

She will read a sexto later. = 她稍后会读一首六行诗。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "sexto" as it's a rather niche term.  Phrases would involve the use of "sexto" within a larger sentence describing poetic forms or styles.  Examples would be too varied to list comprehensively.
