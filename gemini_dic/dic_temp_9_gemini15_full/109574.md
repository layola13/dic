词源:
The verb "let slip" originates from the Old English "lætan," meaning "to allow," "to permit," or "to cause to go," combined with "slipan," meaning "to slide," "to glide," or "to escape."  The combined meaning evolved over time to describe the unintentional or careless release of something, whether information, an opportunity, or control.
