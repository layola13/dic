endotheloid: /ˌɛnˈdoʊθiːlɔɪd/ | adj. | 内皮样细胞的；内皮样的 | Resembling endothelium in structure or function.  The term often refers to cells that appear similar to endothelial cells under a microscope but may not share their full functional properties.  | 例句：The tumor cells exhibited an endotheloid morphology.  肿瘤细胞表现出内皮样形态。

The lesion showed endotheloid features. 病灶显示内皮样特征。| 近义词：endothelial-like, vascular-like | 反义词：无明确反义词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The tumor cells exhibit an endotheloid morphology. = 肿瘤细胞表现出内皮样形态。
The lesion shows endotheloid features. = 病灶显示内皮样特征。

一般过去时:
The biopsy showed endotheloid cells. = 活检显示内皮样细胞。
The pathologist identified endotheloid features in the tissue sample. = 病理学家在组织样本中发现了内皮样特征。

现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several endotheloid cell types. = 研究人员已经确定了几种内皮样细胞类型。
Studies have shown that some endotheloid cells express vascular markers. = 研究表明，一些内皮样细胞表达血管标记物。

过去完成时:
Before the diagnosis, the patient had exhibited endotheloid-like symptoms. = 在诊断之前，患者已经表现出类似内皮样的症状。
Scientists had previously believed that all endotheloid cells were benign. = 科学家们以前认为所有内皮样细胞都是良性的。

将来时:
Further research will investigate the function of endotheloid cells. = 今后的研究将调查内皮样细胞的功能。
We will analyze the sample for endotheloid markers. = 我们将分析样本中的内皮样标记物。

虚拟语气:
If the cells were truly endotheloid, they would express specific markers. = 如果这些细胞确实是内皮样的，它们会表达特定的标记物。
I wish we had more information on the function of these endotheloid cells. = 我希望我们有更多关于这些内皮样细胞功能的信息。

被动语态:
Endotheloid features were observed in the microscopic examination. = 在显微镜检查中观察到内皮样特征。
The presence of endotheloid cells was confirmed by immunohistochemistry. = 免疫组化证实了内皮样细胞的存在。

疑问句:
Are these cells truly endotheloid in nature? = 这些细胞本质上真的是内皮样的吗？
What are the functional implications of endotheloid differentiation? = 内皮样分化的功能意义是什么？

否定句:
The tumor cells did not exhibit typical endotheloid characteristics. = 肿瘤细胞没有表现出典型的内皮样特征。
The sample did not contain any endotheloid cells. = 样本中不包含任何内皮样细胞。


PHRASE->
endotheloid differentiation 内皮样分化
endotheloid morphology 内皮样形态
endotheloid cells 内皮样细胞
endotheloid features 内皮样特征
endotheloid tumor 内皮样肿瘤

词源:
The word "endotheloid" is a combination of "endothelium" (the layer of cells lining the interior surface of blood vessels) and the suffix "-oid," meaning "resembling" or "like."  Therefore, endotheloid means resembling endothelium.
