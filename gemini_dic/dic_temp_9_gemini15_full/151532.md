parsing: /ˈpɑːrsɪŋ/ | n. | 解析；句法分析 |  The process of analyzing a sentence or phrase to determine its grammatical structure and the relationships between its words.  It involves identifying the parts of speech, their functions, and how they combine to form meaningful units.  This is crucial in natural language processing and linguistics. | Example:  The parsing of the sentence revealed a complex subject-verb-object structure.  句子的解析揭示了一个复杂的主谓宾结构。|近义词：analysis, interpretation, breakdown |反义词：synthesis, combination | 名词
