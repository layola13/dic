词源:  The word "libertarianism" derives from the French word "libertarian" (meaning "libertaire" in modern French), which itself is derived from the Latin word "liber," meaning "free." The "-ism" suffix denotes a system of beliefs or principles.  Thus, libertarianism represents a belief system centered on liberty.


用法说明:

Libertarianism is a complex and multifaceted political philosophy.  It is not a monolithic ideology, and there are many different schools of thought within it. These schools often differ on their specific approaches to issues such as the role of the state, property rights, and individual liberties.  The term "libertarianisms" is used to encompass this diversity of viewpoints.  The plural form highlights the existence of various interpretations and applications of core libertarian principles.
