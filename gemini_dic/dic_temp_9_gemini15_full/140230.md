词源:  The word "officious" derives from the Late Latin word *officiosus*, meaning "obliging," "kind," or "helpful."  However, over time, its meaning shifted to its current, more negative connotation.  The change reflects a societal shift in how helpfulness, especially when unsolicited, is perceived.  The original sense of "dutiful" or "obliging" is now largely obsolete.
