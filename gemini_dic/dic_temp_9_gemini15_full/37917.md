词源：The word "complementizer" is a relatively modern term in linguistics.  It's a combination of "complement" (meaning something that completes or adds to something else) and "-izer" (a suffix forming nouns denoting an agent or instrument).  The term reflects the grammatical function of these words in completing the meaning of the main clause by introducing a subordinate clause which acts as a complement.
