fenceful: /ˈfɛnsfʊl/ | adj. | 多篱笆的；设有围栏的；易怒的；爱争吵的 |  The word "fenceful" is not a standard or commonly used word in modern English. It's a relatively rare and archaic word, possibly a blend or a less common variant.  Its meaning is derived from its components: "fence" (a barrier) and "-ful" (full of).  Therefore, its primary meaning refers to something being full of fences or having many fences. However, due to its rarity, it's also possible for it to have a secondary, figurative meaning related to being argumentative or full of contentiousness, similar to how "full of fight" might be used.  Further context is needed to definitively determine the intended meaning. |  例句：The farm was fenceful, making it difficult to cross. (多篱笆的农场)  The old man, though outwardly calm, was known to be fenceful at times. (爱争吵的老人，虽然表面平静，但有时爱争吵。) | 近义词: (depending on context)  enclosed, hedged, contentious, argumentative | 反义词: (depending on context) open, unfenced, peaceful, amicable |
