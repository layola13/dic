近义词：non-resident, visiting (in the context of parenting) | 反义词：custodial


词源:  The word comes from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "custodial," which derives from the Latin word "custos" meaning "guardian" or "keeper."  "Custodial" itself went through Old French ("custodial") before entering English.  Therefore, "non-custodial" literally means "not having guardianship or keeping."
