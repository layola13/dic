/ræˈtaɪtiː/| n.|  不能飞的鸟类 |  Ratite is a term used in ornithology to describe a group of flightless birds characterized by a flat breastbone (sternum) lacking a keel, unlike most flying birds.  This lack of a keel means they lack the large pectoral muscles needed for powerful flight.  They also share other characteristics, such as having a palatal structure different from other birds. |  Examples of ratites include ostriches, emus, kiwis, rheas, and cassowaries.  These birds are found in various parts of the world, primarily in the Southern Hemisphere. The evolutionary history of ratites is complex and subject to ongoing research. |近义词：flightless bird|反义词：carinate bird (有龙骨的鸟类)|名词
