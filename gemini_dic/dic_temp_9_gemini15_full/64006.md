USAGE->
This word is so rarely used that providing examples across grammatical tenses is impractical.  Its usage is essentially limited to describing a formal, often official, letter.  Any attempt to force it into other grammatical structures would be unnatural.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "epistoma".  The word itself is too obscure for phrasal development.
