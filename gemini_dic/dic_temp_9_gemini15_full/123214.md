monoclinal: /ˌmɒnəˈklaɪnəl/ | adj. | 单斜的；单斜褶皱的 | Relating to or characterized by a monoclinal fold, a bend in rock strata that forms a simple slope or dip in one direction.  Monoclinal folds are less complex than anticlines and synclines. | The geologist identified a monoclinal structure in the rock formation. 地质学家在岩层中发现了一个单斜构造。The monoclinal dip of the strata indicated a past tectonic event. 岩层的单斜倾斜表明过去发生过构造事件。|  synonym:  unilateral (in the sense of a single slope) | antonym:  polyclinal, multiclinal
