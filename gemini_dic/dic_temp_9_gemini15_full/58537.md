dufrenite: /ˈdjuːfrənaɪt/ | n. |绿磷铁矿| A dark-green to black, earthy mineral consisting of a hydrated iron phosphate.  It is usually found in sedimentary rocks and is sometimes associated with other phosphate minerals. Dufrenite is a secondary mineral, meaning it forms from the alteration of other minerals. |例句：Dufrenite crystals were discovered in the abandoned mine. 绿磷铁矿晶体在废弃矿井中被发现。

The geological formation of dufrenite in the area is currently being studied. 该地区绿磷铁矿的地质构造目前正在研究中。|近义词：vivianite (another iron phosphate mineral)|反义词：N/A (no direct antonym)|名词
