The word "imprevalency" is formed by adding the prefix "im-" (meaning "not") to "prevalency," which itself is derived from "prevalence."  "Prevalence" comes from the Latin "praevalēre," meaning "to be stronger, to prevail."  Therefore, "imprevalency" literally means "not prevailing" or "lack of prevalence."
