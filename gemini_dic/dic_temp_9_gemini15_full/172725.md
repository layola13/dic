词源:
The word "quacksalver" combines "quack," meaning a boastful pretender, and "salver," a shallow tray used for serving medicines.  The term thus evokes the image of a charlatan displaying his wares.  "Quack" itself comes from an imitative word representing the sound of a duck, which became associated with boastful or pretentious talk.  "Salver" originates from the Old French "salver," meaning a tray.
