词源:

The term "gerrymandering" is derived from the name of Elbridge Gerry, the governor of Massachusetts from 1810 to 1812.  In 1812, Gerry signed a bill redrawing the state's legislative districts in a way that benefited his party.  A political cartoon depicting one of the oddly shaped districts resembled a salamander, leading to the term "Gerry-mander," which later evolved into "gerrymandering."
