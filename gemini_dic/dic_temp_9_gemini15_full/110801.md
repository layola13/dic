linker:/ˈlɪŋkər/ | n. |连接器，链接程序|A linker is a program that takes one or more object files (generated by a compiler or assembler) and combines them into a single executable file, library file, or other output file.  It resolves references between different object files, such as function calls and variable accesses. |Example: The linker combined the object files into a single executable program.  连接器将目标文件组合成单个可执行程序。|近义词：connector, binder |反义词：separator, divider


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The linker resolves the symbols. = 连接器解析符号。

将来时:
The system will automatically link the libraries. = 系统将自动链接库。
We will use a new linker for the next version. = 我们将在下一个版本中使用新的连接器。

虚拟语气:
If we used a different linker, the result might be different. = 如果我们使用不同的连接器，结果可能会有所不同。
It's essential that the linker correctly resolves all dependencies. = 连接器正确解析所有依赖关系至关重要。

被动语态:
The object files were linked together by the linker. = 目标文件由连接器链接在一起。
The executable file is being linked at the moment. = 可执行文件正在链接中。

疑问句:
Which linker are you using for this project? = 你这个项目用的是哪个连接器？
Has the linker reported any errors? = 连接器是否报告了任何错误？

否定句:
The linker did not find the required library. = 连接器没有找到所需的库。
The program failed to link because of a missing dependency. = 程序由于缺少依赖项而无法链接。
