The term "chav" is believed to have originated in the early 2000s in the UK, though its exact etymology is debated. One theory links it to the Romani word "chavi," meaning "child." Another suggests it's a shortening of "charva,"  a slang term for a cheap alcoholic drink.  Regardless of its origin, its usage quickly became associated with negative stereotypes.
