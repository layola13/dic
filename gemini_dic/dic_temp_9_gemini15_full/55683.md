dittology:/dɪˈtɑːlədʒi/| n. |迭词；重复说|The unnecessary repetition of a word or phrase, often due to a speech impediment or nervous habit.  It's a type of speech error that can affect both spoken and written language.

USAGE->
(Dittology, being a noun, doesn't have verb conjugations like the example word "what".)  Dittology itself doesn't have tenses or voice.  Its usage is descriptive, explaining a phenomenon.

例句1: The professor identified several instances of dittology in the student's essay. 教授在学生的论文中发现了几个迭词的例子。

例句2:  Nervousness often leads to dittology in public speaking. 紧张通常会导致公开演讲中的迭词。


PHRASE->
(Dittology doesn't have common phrases associated with it in the same way as "what".)  It's a linguistic term describing a phenomenon, not a word used in common phrases.  Instead, we might use phrases *describing* dittology, such as:

例句1:  an example of dittology 一个迭词的例子

例句2:  suffering from dittology 患有迭词症


词源:

The word "dittology" comes from the Greek words "dis" (twice) and "logos" (word or speech). Thus, it literally means "twice-said" or "double-speaking".  Its formation reflects the nature of the linguistic phenomenon it describes.
