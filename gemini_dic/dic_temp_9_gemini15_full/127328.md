词源:

The word "Nazarene" derives from Nazareth, the town in Galilee where Jesus Christ spent his youth.  It's ultimately from the Hebrew word נָצְרָת (Natzrat), meaning "branch" or "guarded."  The term came to be used to describe followers of Jesus and later, more broadly, to refer to Christians, especially Protestants, emphasizing their simple and pious lifestyle.
