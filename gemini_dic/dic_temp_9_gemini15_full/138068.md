词源：

The word "normalising" is derived from the word "normal," which comes from the Latin word "normalis," meaning "perpendicular" or "according to rule."  The suffix "-izing" indicates the act of making something normal.  The evolution reflects a shift in meaning from geometrical perpendicularity to a broader sense of conformity to a standard or average.
