hafnium:/ˈhæfniəm/| n. |铪| A chemical element, a hard, silvery-grey, lustrous transition metal that is highly resistant to corrosion. It is used in some alloys and in nuclear reactors.  | Example: Hafnium is used in control rods for nuclear reactors because of its ability to absorb neutrons. 铪由于其吸收中子的能力，被用于核反应堆的控制棒中。|近义词:  (No close synonyms due to its unique chemical properties)|反义词: (No direct antonyms)|名词
