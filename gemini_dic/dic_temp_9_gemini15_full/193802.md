词源:  The word is formed from "self-" (oneself) + "deprecating" (expressing disapproval of; belittling).  "Deprecate" itself comes from the Latin "deprecari" meaning "to pray against," "to avert," or "to beg off."  The sense of belittling developed from the idea of praying against one's own worth or achievements.
