PHRASE->

There are no common idiomatic phrases using "kneadabilities".  The word is relatively uncommon and technical.  Phrases would likely be constructed around the concept of kneading and plasticity rather than using "kneadabilities" directly.  Examples would be:  "the ease of kneading," "the plasticity of the material," "the ability to knead," etc.
