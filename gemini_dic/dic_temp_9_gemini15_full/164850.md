preformation:/ˌpriːfɔːrˈmeɪʃən/| n. | 预成论；预先形成 | The theory that an organism is fully formed at the beginning of its development and simply grows larger.  This contrasts with epigenesis, where the organism develops gradually.  | Example:  The theory of preformation was a dominant idea in biology before the acceptance of epigenesis. = 预成论在表观遗传学被接受之前是生物学中占主导地位的思想。

The concept of preformation was a widely held belief in the 17th and 18th centuries, suggesting that a miniature version of the organism (a homunculus) was already present in the sperm or egg, and development simply involved its growth.  | 近义词：predetermination, predevelopment | 反义词：epigenesis
