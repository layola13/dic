词源:  The word is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the plural noun "profanenesses," which itself is derived from "profaneness" (the state or quality of being profane; irreverence).  "Profane" ultimately comes from the Latin "profanus," meaning "outside the temple," implying something unholy or disrespectful.
