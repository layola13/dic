词源:

The word "self-postponement" is a compound word.  "Self" is a prefix indicating something related to oneself. "Postponement" comes from the verb "postpone," which originates from the Old French "postponer" (to put after), itself derived from "post" (after) + "ponere" (to put) from Latin.  Therefore, "self-postponement" literally means the act of putting something related to oneself off to a later time.
