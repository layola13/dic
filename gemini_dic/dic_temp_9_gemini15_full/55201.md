词源:
The word "dissertate" comes from the Late Latin word "dissertare," meaning "to converse," "to discourse," or "to discuss."  This, in turn, is derived from the Latin prefix "dis-" (apart, away) and the verb "serere" (to connect, to join, to weave).  The original sense suggests a weaving together of arguments or ideas.
