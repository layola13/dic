词源:

The word "sales" originates from the Old English word "salu," meaning "sale," which in turn is derived from the Proto-Germanic word "*salwō," having the same meaning.  The modern English word evolved through Middle English "sale" and eventually to its current plural form "sales" to represent the aggregate of sales transactions or the volume of sales.
