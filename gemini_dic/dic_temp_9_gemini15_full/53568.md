词源:

* **dis-**:  prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of"
* **believe**:  from Old English *gɪlēfan*, meaning "to believe, trust."  Related to Old High German *gilouban*, and ultimately Proto-Germanic *galoubōną*.
* **-er**: suffix forming agent nouns (people who do something)
* **-'s**: possessive suffix


The word "disbeliever" is a relatively straightforward combination of these elements, indicating someone who does *not* believe.  The addition of "'s" makes it possessive, referring to something belonging to or characteristic of a disbeliever.
