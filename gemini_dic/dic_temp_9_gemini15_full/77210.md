The word "gastful" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested.  It is likely a misspelling or a newly coined word not yet widely adopted.
