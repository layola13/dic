词源:
The word "pilot" comes from the Middle English word "pilote," which in turn originates from the Old French "pilote" and ultimately the Late Latin "pilota."  These words referred to a person who steers a ship, derived from the Latin word "pila" meaning "ball" or "sphere," suggesting a connection to steering something round.
