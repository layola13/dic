nuclear-pile:/ˈnjuːkliər paɪl/| n. |核反应堆|A nuclear pile, now more commonly called a nuclear reactor, is a device used to initiate and control a sustained nuclear chain reaction.  It's a structure where nuclear fission occurs, releasing a large amount of energy.  This energy can then be used to generate electricity or for other purposes. The term "pile" is an older, less precise term that reflects the early designs of these reactors, which often resembled stacks of materials.|The first nuclear pile was built by Enrico Fermi and his team in Chicago in 1942.|近义词：nuclear reactor|反义词：无
