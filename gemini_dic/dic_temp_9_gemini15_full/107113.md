ladros does not appear to be a word in standard English or other widely-used languages.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a word from a very obscure language, a newly coined term, or a proper noun.  If you can provide more context (e.g., where you encountered this word), I may be able to offer more assistance.
