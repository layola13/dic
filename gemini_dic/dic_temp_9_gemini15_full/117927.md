词源:
The word "melty" is derived from the verb "melt," meaning to change from a solid to a liquid state due to heat.  The suffix "-y" is added to create an adjective describing a state or quality. The word's history traces back to Old English "meltan,"  related to Proto-Germanic "*meltan," and ultimately to Proto-Indo-European "*mel-," meaning "to soften" or "to flow."
