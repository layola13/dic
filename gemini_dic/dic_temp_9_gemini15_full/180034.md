refixes:/ˈriːfɪksɪz/ | n. |词头 | Refixes are prefixes that are added to the beginning of a word to change its meaning. They are a type of affix, which is a morpheme that is added to a word to change its form or meaning.  Refixes are often used to create new words or to change the grammatical function of a word. For example, the prefix "un-" can be added to the word "happy" to create the word "unhappy," which means "not happy." |The prefixes "un-", "re-", "pre-", and "dis-" are all examples of refixes. They can modify the meaning of the root word significantly.  |  The study of refixes is a part of morphology, the study of word formation. |近义词：prefixes |反义词：suffixes
