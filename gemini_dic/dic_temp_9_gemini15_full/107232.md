The word "lairdlier" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries, and it's not a recognizable word formed through common English word-formation processes.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very obscure dialect.


To provide an analysis as requested, we need a valid English word. If you could provide the intended word or more context, I can gladly provide the requested analysis following the format.
