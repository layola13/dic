interhyal: /ˌɪntərˈhaɪəl/ | n. | 舌骨间肌 |  The interhyal muscle is a small muscle located between the hyoid bones. It plays a role in swallowing and other functions related to the hyoid apparatus.  | The study focused on the anatomy and function of the interhyal muscles in various species.  这项研究侧重于不同物种的舌骨间肌的解剖结构和功能。|  (no close synonyms due to specificity) | (no direct antonyms) | 名词


USAGE->
(This word is highly specialized and doesn't lend itself to common grammatical usage examples like "what" does.  The examples below show its use in a scientific context.)

一般现在时:
The interhyal muscle contracts during swallowing. = 吞咽时，舌骨间肌收缩。
Researchers study the interhyal muscle's role in vocalization. = 研究人员研究舌骨间肌在发声中的作用。


一般过去时:
The researchers dissected the interhyal muscle carefully. = 研究人员仔细地解剖了舌骨间肌。
The study described the unique features of the interhyal muscle in that species. = 这项研究描述了该物种舌骨间肌的独特特征。


现在完成时:
Scientists have mapped the innervation of the interhyal muscle. = 科学家们已经绘制了舌骨间肌的神经支配图谱。
Studies have shown the interhyal muscle's importance in hyoid bone movement. = 研究表明舌骨间肌在舌骨运动中的重要性。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had carefully prepared the interhyal muscle samples. = 实验前，他们已经仔细准备了舌骨间肌样本。
The researchers had already observed the interhyal muscle's activity before the analysis. = 研究人员在分析之前就已经观察到舌骨间肌的活动。


将来时:
Future studies will investigate the interhyal muscle's connection to other muscles. = 未来研究将调查舌骨间肌与其他肌肉的联系。
Scientists will further analyze the interhyal muscle's role in speech production. = 科学家们将进一步分析舌骨间肌在语音产生中的作用。


虚拟语气:
If the interhyal muscle were damaged, swallowing would be difficult. = 如果舌骨间肌受损，吞咽就会困难。
It is hypothesized that if the interhyal muscle were stronger, vocalization would improve. = 假设如果舌骨间肌更强壮，发声就会改善。


被动语态:
The interhyal muscle was carefully examined under a microscope. = 舌骨间肌在显微镜下被仔细检查。
The function of the interhyal muscle is still being investigated. = 舌骨间肌的功能仍在研究中。


疑问句:
What is the precise function of the interhyal muscle? = 舌骨间肌的确切功能是什么？
How does the interhyal muscle contribute to hyoid bone stability? = 舌骨间肌如何促进舌骨的稳定性？


否定句:
The interhyal muscle is not easily visible in all species. = 舌骨间肌并非在所有物种中都容易观察到。
The study did not find a significant correlation between interhyal muscle size and vocal range. = 该研究没有发现舌骨间肌大小与发声范围之间存在显著的相关性。
