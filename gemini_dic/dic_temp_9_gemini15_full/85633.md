词源:
The word "haunched" is derived from the Old French word "hanche," meaning "hip."  The verb "haunch" originally referred to the act of striking with the hip. Over time, the meaning shifted to describe the posture of someone with a bent or rounded back, suggesting the weight is resting on the hips.
