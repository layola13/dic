词源:

The word "nonpresentability" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "presentability."  "Presentability" itself derives from "presentable," which combines the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in front of") and the verb "present" (meaning "to show," "to exhibit," or "to offer").  The suffix "-ability" denotes capacity or capability.  Therefore, "nonpresentability" literally means "the state of not being presentable."
