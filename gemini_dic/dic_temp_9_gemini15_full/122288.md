mitotic:/maɪˈtɒtɪk/ | adj. | 有丝分裂的；属于有丝分裂的 | Relating to or characterized by mitosis.  Mitosis is a type of cell division that results in two daughter cells each having the same number and kind of chromosomes as the parent nucleus, typical of ordinary tissue growth. | Example: The mitotic phase is a crucial stage in the cell cycle.  有丝分裂期是细胞周期中的一个关键阶段。 The mitotic spindle plays a vital role in chromosome segregation. 有丝分裂纺锤体在染色体分离中起着至关重要的作用。|近义词：cellular, divisional |反义词：meiotic
