heterothermy:/ˌhɛtəˈrɔːrmi/| n. |异温性，变温性|The ability of an animal to vary its body temperature depending on environmental conditions.  This is in contrast to homeothermy, where body temperature is kept relatively constant.  Many animals exhibit heterothermy to varying degrees, employing strategies such as torpor or hibernation to conserve energy.|Example: Many reptiles exhibit heterothermy, basking in the sun to raise their body temperature and seeking shade to cool down.|近义词：poikilothermy (more specifically refers to fluctuating body temperature)|反义词：homeothermy
