USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective and doesn't conjugate like verbs. Therefore, typical verb conjugations (present, past, future, etc.) are not applicable.  The word itself describes a state or quality.


PHRASE->

Because "fellable" is a relatively uncommon and context-dependent word,  standard phrases aren't readily available.  Its usage is primarily limited to descriptive sentences.  For example:

"a fellable face"  一张诱人的脸庞

"He found her fellable" 他觉得她很诱人


注意事项:

The pronunciation is consistent across American and British English.  The emphasis lies on the first syllable.  The word is informal and should be used cautiously due to its strong sexual undertones.
