词源:  The word "hoity" likely originated as a dialectal variant in the late 16th century.  Its exact etymology is uncertain, but it's possibly related to older words suggesting a sense of being "high" or "lofty" in social standing, perhaps connected to "height" or even a mimicking of a pompous tone.  The addition of "-toity" further emphasizes the exaggerated and affected nature of the arrogance.
