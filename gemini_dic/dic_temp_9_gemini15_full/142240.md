orohippus:/ˌɔːroʊˈhɪpəs/| n. |始祖馬|Orohippus is an extinct genus of early horse that lived during the Eocene epoch, approximately 55 to 34 million years ago.  It is considered a transitional form between earlier horses like Hyracotherium and later, more modern horses. Orohippus possessed several features intermediate between these earlier and later forms, such as an increase in size, lengthening of the face, and modifications in tooth structure.  It was a relatively small animal,  and its fossils have been found in North America. |The discovery of Orohippus fossils helped scientists understand the evolutionary pathway of the horse. |近义词:  (paleontological context)  Eohippus, Epihippus|反义词: (no direct antonym, as it refers to a specific extinct species)|n.
