词源:

The word "rematerializing" is formed from the prefix "re-" (again, back), the noun "material" (physical substance), and the suffix "-izing" (making or causing to become).  The base word "material" comes from the Old French "material" and ultimately from the Latin "materialis," meaning "relating to matter."
