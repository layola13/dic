epigram:/ˈɛpɪɡræm/ | n. |警句；隽语；讽刺短诗 | A short, witty, and often paradoxical saying.  It can be a poem, but is more commonly a concise statement. Epigrams often employ antithesis or irony. | Example: "I can resist everything except temptation." - Oscar Wilde. This is a classic example of an epigram because it's short, witty, and paradoxical.  |近义词：maxim, aphorism, motto, saying |反义词：long-winded statement, verbose explanation |
  
Example 2: "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." - Steve Jobs.  This is another example, conveying a significant idea concisely and memorably.


词源：From Greek ἐπίγραμμα (epígramma), literally "inscription," from ἐπιγράφειν (epigraphéin), "to write upon," from ἐπί (epí), "upon" + γράφειν (graphein), "to write."  Initially, epigrams were inscriptions on monuments or works of art.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass witty and concise sayings.
