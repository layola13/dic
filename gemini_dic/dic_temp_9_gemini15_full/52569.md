词源:
The word "diffuser" comes from the verb "diffuse," meaning "to spread or cause to spread over a wide area."  "Diffuse" itself originates from the Latin word "diffundere," which is a combination of "dis-" (apart) and "fundere" (to pour).  Therefore, the word's root implies the action of spreading something out.
