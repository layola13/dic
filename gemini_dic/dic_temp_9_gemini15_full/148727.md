词源:
The word "overtread" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "beyond") and the verb "tread" (meaning "to walk" or "to step").  Thus, it literally means "to step beyond."  The meaning has evolved to emphasize the transgression of limits or boundaries, often with negative connotations.
