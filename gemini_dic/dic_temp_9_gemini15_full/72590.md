fly-beam:/ˈflaɪ biːm/| n. |飞行梁，飞梁|A fly-beam is a structural element, typically a beam or girder, used in bridges or other structures to support a roadway or other load, often cantilevered or otherwise projecting from a supporting structure. It's characterized by its apparent "flying" or unsupported nature, creating a visual impression of lightness.  |例句：The bridge's elegant design featured a series of graceful fly-beams. 这座桥梁优雅的设计采用了若干优美的飞梁。  The architect incorporated fly-beams to maximize the open space beneath the bridge. 建筑师采用了飞梁来最大限度地扩大桥下方的开放空间。|近义词：cantilever beam, overhanging beam|反义词：N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The fly-beam supports the weight of the road. = 飞梁支撑着道路的重量。
The bridge uses several fly-beams for its design. = 这座桥梁在设计中使用了数个飞梁。


一般过去时:
The engineers inspected the fly-beam for damage. = 工程师们检查了飞梁是否有损坏。
The old fly-beam was replaced with a stronger one. = 旧的飞梁被更换成一个更结实的。


现在完成时:
They have installed new fly-beams on the bridge. = 他们已经在这座桥上安装了新的飞梁。
The construction team has completed the fly-beam installation. = 建设团队已经完成了飞梁的安装。


过去完成时:
The bridge had collapsed because the fly-beam failed. = 桥梁倒塌是因为飞梁失效了。
Before the renovation, the fly-beam had been weakened by corrosion. = 在翻修之前，飞梁已经被腐蚀削弱了。


将来时:
They will install the fly-beam next week. = 他们下周将安装飞梁。
The new bridge will utilize advanced fly-beam technology. = 新桥将采用先进的飞梁技术。


虚拟语气:
If the fly-beam were stronger, the bridge would be safer. = 如果飞梁更结实，桥梁就会更安全。

否定句:
The bridge does not use fly-beams. = 这座桥没有使用飞梁。
The fly-beam did not fail under stress. = 飞梁在压力下没有失效。


PHRASE->
fly-beam design = 飞梁设计
strengthened fly-beam = 加固的飞梁
