mesoplast:/ˈmɛsoʊplæst/| n. |中胚层|A mesoplast is a hypothetical structure proposed in some older biological models.  It was considered to be an intermediate stage in the development of a cell, specifically in the formation of the mesoderm (middle germ layer) during embryogenesis.  However, this term and the concept it represents are largely obsolete in modern developmental biology. More recent research has provided more detailed and accurate models of cell development, rendering the "mesoplast" concept unnecessary. |例句：The older literature mentions a "mesoplast" as a precursor to mesoderm formation, but this is now considered outdated. =  较老的文献提到“中胚层母体”作为中胚层形成的前体，但这现在被认为是过时的。|近义词：mesenchymal precursor (a more modern and accurate term)|反义词：N/A


USAGE->
(由于mesoplast是一个过时的生物学名词，其用法仅限于讨论过时的生物学理论，因此无法提供各种时态的例句)


PHRASE->
(由于mesoplast本身就是一个过时的术语，因此没有常见的词组搭配)
