词源:
The word "disclaim" comes from the Old French "desclamer," which is composed of the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away from" or "not") and "clamer" (meaning "to cry out" or "to proclaim").  Therefore, "disclaim" literally means "to cry out against" or "to deny publicly."  The modern sense evolved from this original meaning of formally rejecting or refusing something.
