词源:
The word "insurmountablenesses" is derived from the adjective "insurmountable," which is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the verb "surmount" (meaning "to overcome or conquer"), and the suffix "-able" (meaning "capable of").  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality.  Adding "-es" makes it plural.  Therefore, "insurmountablenesses" literally means "the states or qualities of being incapable of being overcome."
