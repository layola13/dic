cellulosity: /ˌsɛljuˈlɒsəti/ | n. |纤维素含量；纤维素性质 | The state or quality of being cellulosic; the abundance or proportion of cellulose in a substance.  It refers to the amount and characteristics of cellulose present in a material. | 例句：The high cellulosity of cotton makes it ideal for textile production. 棉花的纤维素含量高，使其成为纺织生产的理想材料。

The cellulosity of this paper is exceptionally high, resulting in its durability. 这张纸的纤维素含量非常高，因此非常耐用。


近义词：cellulose content, fibrousness | 反义词：无  | 词性：名词


词源:  Derived from "cellulose" + "-ity," a suffix forming nouns of quality or state.  "Cellulose" itself originates from French "cellulose," coined in the 19th century from "cellule" (cell) reflecting its cellular origin in plants.
