词源:
The word "reenvisions" is formed from the prefix "re-" (again) and the verb "envision" (to imagine).  "Envision" itself comes from the Old French "envisager," meaning "to face, confront," which ultimately derives from Latin roots implying "to see into."  Therefore, "reenvisions" literally means "to imagine or see into something again."
