词源:  The word derives from "second-rate," which itself combines "second" (meaning "inferior" or "of lower quality in a ranking system") and "rate" (meaning "to classify" or "to evaluate").  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "second-rate" into a noun, denoting the condition or quality of being second-rate.
