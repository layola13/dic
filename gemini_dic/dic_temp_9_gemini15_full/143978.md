词源：
The word "outrage" comes from the Old French word "outrager," which meant "to do violence to," or "to violate."  This, in turn, derives from "outre," meaning "beyond" or "over," and "ager," meaning "to act" or "to do."  Therefore, the original meaning suggested an action that went "beyond" acceptable limits.
