personalism: /ˈpɜːrsənəlɪzəm/ | n. | 个人主义；人格主义 |

英文解析:  Personalism is a philosophical theory emphasizing the importance of the individual person. It contrasts with both collectivism (prioritizing the group) and individualism (emphasizing self-reliance and autonomy without necessarily acknowledging the inherent value of each person). Personalism highlights the unique value and dignity of each person, often grounded in religious or spiritual beliefs, and stresses interpersonal relationships and community.  Different forms of personalism exist, with varying degrees of emphasis on aspects like freedom, responsibility, and the relationship between the individual and the divine.
