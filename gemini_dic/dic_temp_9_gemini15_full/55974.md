dma:/ˈdiːɛmeɪ/|abbr.|直接存储器存取|直接内存访问，直接存储器访问|Direct Memory Access; a method of transferring data between memory and devices without involving the CPU. This increases efficiency by freeing up the CPU for other tasks.|例句：The DMA controller manages data transfers between the hard drive and RAM.|近义词：memory access|反义词:CPU-mediated transfer


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The DMA controller transfers data efficiently. = DMA 控制器高效地传输数据。
DMA improves system performance. = DMA 提高了系统性能。


一般过去时:
The DMA transfer completed successfully. = DMA 传输成功完成。
The system used DMA for faster data access. = 系统使用 DMA 来加快数据访问速度。


现在完成时:
The system has used DMA since its inception. = 自从系统创建以来，它就一直使用 DMA。
The engineer has implemented DMA for improved performance. = 工程师已实施 DMA 以提高性能。


过去完成时:
The data had been transferred via DMA before the program terminated. = 在程序终止之前，数据已通过 DMA 传输。
The system had already utilized DMA for optimal speed. = 系统已经利用 DMA 来获得最佳速度。


将来时:
The new system will utilize DMA for faster data processing. = 新系统将利用 DMA 来更快地处理数据。
The developers will implement DMA to enhance efficiency. = 开发人员将实施 DMA 以提高效率。


虚拟语气:
If we used DMA, the transfer would be much faster. = 如果我们使用 DMA，传输速度会快得多。
It would be beneficial if the system supported DMA. = 如果系统支持 DMA，那将是有益的。


被动语态:
Data is transferred by DMA efficiently. = 数据通过 DMA 高效地传输。
DMA is used extensively in modern computer systems. = DMA 在现代计算机系统中得到广泛使用。


疑问句:
Does this system support DMA? = 这个系统支持 DMA 吗？
Is DMA being used for this operation? = 此操作是否正在使用 DMA？


否定句:
The system doesn't use DMA. = 该系统不使用 DMA。
The data wasn't transferred via DMA. = 数据并非通过 DMA 传输。



PHRASE->
DMA transfer = DMA 传输
DMA controller = DMA 控制器
DMA burst = DMA突发
DMA channel = DMA 通道
DMA interrupt = DMA 中断
