词源:  The word is formed by adding the suffix "-less" (meaning "without") to the noun "occupation," which comes from the Old French word "occupacion" and ultimately from the Latin word "occupatio" (the act of occupying or taking possession).  Thus, "occupationless" literally means "without an occupation."
