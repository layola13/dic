词源:
The word "ravenous" ultimately derives from the Old French word "ravenous," meaning "greedy" or "voracious."  This, in turn, is related to the Old French word "ravener," meaning "to devour" or "to prey upon."  The connection to the bird "raven" is due to the raven's reputation for its voracious appetite.
