词源:

The word "earwig" comes from the Old English "ēarwicga," a compound of "ēare" (ear) and "wicga" (insect, beetle, or similar creature). The name is derived from the unfounded belief that these insects crawl into people's ears.  The "wig" part is related to words like "wiggle" suggesting a small, creeping creature.
