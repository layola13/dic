词源:

The word "harbouring" comes from the Old English word "heafod", meaning "head" or "chief", and later evolved through Middle English "habor" to its modern form.  The original sense referred to a safe place, a shelter, which then extended to the figurative meaning of sheltering or concealing.  The spelling "harbour" is the British English spelling; "harbor" is the American English spelling.
