The word "fumaru" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling, a word from another language, or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage examples are not possible.  To provide a response, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (a book, a website, a conversation)
* **What is the surrounding text or context?** This will help determine the intended meaning.

If you can provide this information, I can offer a more accurate analysis or suggest possible alternatives.
