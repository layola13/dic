monophone:/ˈmɒnəfoʊn/| n. |单音节词；单音素|A monophone is a single sound unit, typically a syllable consisting of one vowel or consonant sound, often used in speech recognition systems as the basic unit of speech.  It's a single sound that represents a phoneme, the smallest unit of sound that distinguishes meaning in a language.|Example: The word "a" is a monophone.  The word "go" is also a monophone. |近义词:single sound, single syllable|反义词:polysyllable, multiphone



USAGE->
一般现在时:
The word "cat" is a monophone in some speech recognition systems. = 在某些语音识别系统中，“cat”是一个单音节词。
This monophone represents the sound /b/. = 这个单音素代表/b/音。


一般过去时:
That monophone was incorrectly identified by the software. = 该单音素被软件错误识别。
The researchers analyzed the monophones in the dataset. = 研究人员分析了数据集中单音素。


现在完成时:

The system has correctly identified all the monophones so far. = 系统到目前为止已正确识别所有单音素。


过去完成时:
They had already processed all the monophones before the analysis began. = 在分析开始之前，他们已经处理了所有单音素。
The team had carefully selected the monophones for the experiment. = 该团队已仔细选择了实验的单音素。


将来时:
We will use monophones to build a new speech recognition model. = 我们将使用单音素构建新的语音识别模型。
The company will likely incorporate more monophones into their system. = 该公司可能会在其系统中加入更多单音素。


虚拟语气:
If we had more data, we could improve the accuracy of monophone recognition. = 如果我们有更多数据，我们可以提高单音素识别的准确性。
It would be ideal if all the monophones were clearly articulated. = 如果所有单音素都清晰表达，那就最好了。


被动语态:

The monophones were accurately recognized by the new system. = 新系统准确地识别了单音素。


疑问句:
Are these sounds considered monophones? = 这些声音被认为是单音素吗？
How many monophones are there in this language? = 这门语言有多少单音素？


否定句:
This word is not a monophone; it has two syllables. = 这个词不是单音节词；它有两个音节。
The model did not correctly identify all the monophones. = 模型没有正确识别所有单音素。
