non-offer:/ˈnɒnˈɔːfər/ | n. |非要约；未提出要约 |A non-offer is a statement or action that does not constitute a legally binding offer to contract.  It lacks the essential elements of a valid offer, such as definiteness, intent to be bound, and communication to the offeree. For example, an advertisement is generally considered a non-offer, as it is an invitation to treat rather than a firm commitment to sell.  |例句：The advertisement for the car was a non-offer; it merely invited customers to make an offer to buy.  这则汽车广告并非要约；它仅仅是邀请顾客提出购买要约。

The preliminary negotiations were characterized by non-offers and counter-proposals. 初步谈判的特点是非要约和反建议。|近义词：invitation to treat, preliminary negotiation, suggestion |反义词：offer, proposal, bid |  词性:noun
