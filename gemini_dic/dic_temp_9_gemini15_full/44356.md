词源:
The word "cross-breed" is a compound word.  "Cross" comes from Old English *cris, meaning "across," indicating the mixing of different breeds. "Breed" comes from Old English brēdan, meaning "to bring forth young," referencing the act of reproduction.  Therefore, "cross-breed" literally means "to breed across" different varieties.
