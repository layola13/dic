词源:
The word "righting" comes from the Old English word *rihtan*, meaning "to make straight, to set right, to correct."  This ultimately derives from Proto-Germanic *rekhtizōnan*, sharing a root with words indicating "straight," "just," and "correct."  The modern English verb "to right" retains this core meaning, and "righting" functions as its gerund or present participle, denoting the action or process of making something correct or straight.
