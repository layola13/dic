词源:
The word "ectoplasmatic" is derived from "ectoplasm," a combination of the prefix "ecto-" (meaning "outside" or "external") and "plasm" (referring to the protoplasm or living substance of a cell).  The term was initially used in a biological context but gained popularity in the context of spiritualism and parapsychology.
