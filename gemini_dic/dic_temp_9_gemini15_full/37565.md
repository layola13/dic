词源:
From the word "commotion," which comes from the Old French *commocioun, from the verb *commouvoir, meaning "to move greatly," "to disturb," ultimately from Latin *commovēre, from *com- (together) + *movēre (to move).  Therefore, "commotional" describes something characterized by great movement or disturbance.
