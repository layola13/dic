USAGE->
一般现在时:
The nonseptate hyphae are spreading rapidly. = 无隔膜的菌丝正在迅速蔓延。
This fungus presents nonseptate hyphae. =这种真菌呈现无隔膜菌丝。


一般过去时:
The researchers observed nonseptate hyphae in the sample. = 研究人员在样本中观察到无隔膜菌丝。
The experiment showed nonseptate hyphae growth. = 实验显示了无隔膜菌丝的生长。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified many species with nonseptate hyphae. = 科学家们已经鉴定出许多具有无隔膜菌丝的物种。
We have observed the rapid spread of nonseptate hyphae. = 我们已经观察到无隔膜菌丝的迅速蔓延。


过去完成时:
They had already noted the presence of nonseptate hyphae before the analysis. = 在分析之前，他们已经注意到无隔膜菌丝的存在。
Researchers had hypothesized that the fungus would have nonseptate hyphae. = 研究人员曾假设这种真菌会有无隔膜菌丝。


将来时:
We will examine the nonseptate hyphae under the microscope. = 我们将用显微镜检查无隔膜菌丝。
The study will focus on the characteristics of nonseptate hyphae. = 这项研究将重点关注无隔膜菌丝的特性。


虚拟语气:
If the hyphae were nonseptate, they would spread faster. = 如果菌丝是无隔膜的，它们就会蔓延得更快。
I wish I had known the hyphae were nonseptate earlier. = 我真希望我早点知道菌丝是无隔膜的。


被动语态:
Nonseptate hyphae were observed in the sample. = 在样本中观察到无隔膜菌丝。
The rapid spread of nonseptate hyphae was documented. = 无隔膜菌丝的迅速蔓延已被记录在案。


疑问句:
Are these hyphae septate or nonseptate? = 这些菌丝是有隔膜的还是无隔膜的？
Does this fungus have nonseptate hyphae? = 这种真菌有无隔膜菌丝吗？


否定句:
The hyphae were not nonseptate; they had septa. = 菌丝不是无隔膜的；它们有隔膜。
The fungus did not exhibit nonseptate hyphae. = 该真菌没有表现出无隔膜菌丝。
