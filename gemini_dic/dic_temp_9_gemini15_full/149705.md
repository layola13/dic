词源:
The word "paladin" originates from the Old French word "paladin," which in turn comes from the Latin word "palatinus."  "Palatinus" referred to an official of the imperial palace in the Roman Empire, often holding high rank and authority.  Over time, the word evolved to describe a knight of exceptional virtue and prowess, associated with Charlemagne's court and later romanticized in medieval literature.  The association with chivalry and noble ideals solidified its modern meaning.
