/ˌpriːroʊˈmæntɪsɪzəm/| n. |前浪漫主义|Pre-Romanticism refers to the period in European art, literature, and music that preceded the Romantic movement (roughly from the late 17th century to the late 18th century). It shares some characteristics with Romanticism but also exhibits significant differences.  It's characterized by a growing emphasis on emotion, individualism, and nature, but these elements are not yet fully developed as they would be in the Romantic period.  Pre-Romantic works often show a rejection of strict classical forms and a growing interest in the subjective experience, but they don't fully embrace the radical individualism and emotional intensity that define Romanticism. |The Sturm und Drang movement in German literature is a prime example of Pre-Romanticism.  Many of the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau are considered precursors to Romanticism and are thus placed within the Pre-Romantic period. |近义词：proto-Romanticism, early Romanticism |反义词：High Romanticism, late Romanticism |名词
