词源:

The word "sacrilegiousness" is derived from the adjective "sacrilegious," which itself originates from the Late Latin word "sacrilegium."  This word is a combination of "sacr-" (sacred, holy) and "-legium" (gathering, collecting).  Therefore, "sacrilegium" literally meant "the stealing of sacred things."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating the state or quality of being sacrilegious.


用法说明:

Sacrilegiousness is primarily used as a noun to describe the quality or state of being sacrilegious. It emphasizes the disrespectful or irreverent nature of an action or attitude towards something considered sacred.  The context is typically religious, but it can also be extended to other contexts where something is held in high regard or considered inviolable.  For instance, defacing a national monument could be described as an act of sacrilegiousness depending on the cultural significance of the monument.
