词源：

The word "courtliness" originates from the Old French word "corteisie," which means "courtesy," "courtly behavior," or "chivalry."  This, in turn, derives from "cour," meaning "court."  The association with royal courts is central to its meaning – courtliness refers to the refined manners and etiquette expected within those settings.  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "courtly" into the noun "courtliness," indicating a quality or state.
