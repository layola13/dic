词源:
The term "fritzed-out" is informal and likely a blend of "fried" (meaning exhausted) and possibly a slang term suggesting a state of mental or physical breakdown.  The exact origin is difficult to pinpoint, but its use suggests a colloquialism emerging in recent decades.  The "fritz" element might allude to something malfunctioning or breaking down, reinforcing the sense of exhaustion and depletion.
