词源：

The word "overindustrialized" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or too much), the adjective "industrialized" (meaning having undergone extensive industrial development), and the suffix "-ized" (meaning made or become).  "Industrialized" itself comes from "industry" (from Latin *industria, meaning diligence, skill) and the suffix "-alized" (from "-ize," a verb-forming suffix).
