词源:
The word "ironclad" literally means "clad in iron," combining "iron" (referring to the strong metal) and "clad" (meaning clothed or covered).  Its figurative use developed from the literal description of ships with iron plating, signifying their strength and invulnerability.  The earliest usage in this figurative sense emerged in the mid-19th century.
