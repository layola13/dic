词源:
The word "honeymooners" is a compound word.  "Honeymoon" itself is of uncertain origin, with several theories. One popular theory connects it to the ancient practice of drinking honey mead for a month after the wedding, hence "honey moon." "ers" is a suffix that transforms a noun into a plural form indicating people doing or connected to the action.  Thus, "honeymooners" refers to people engaged in a honeymoon.
