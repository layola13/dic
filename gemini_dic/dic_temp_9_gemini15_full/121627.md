词源：

* **mis-:**  A prefix meaning "wrongly," "badly," or "ill."
* **para-:** A prefix meaning "beside," "near," or "alongside."
* **phrase:**  From Old French *fraser*  (to express), ultimately from Latin *phrasis* (a phrase, way of speaking).
* **-ed:** Past participle suffix indicating a completed action.

Therefore, "misparaphrased" means a paraphrase that has been done incorrectly, distorting the original meaning.


用法说明:

misparaphrased主要用作形容词，修饰名词，例如文章、句子或演讲等。它强调的是对原意的歪曲或误解，而非简单的表达方式不同。
