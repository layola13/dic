词源:  The word is formed by combining "self," referring to oneself, and "seekingness," derived from the verb "seek," meaning to try to find or obtain something. The "-ness" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, self-seekingness describes the state of being self-seeking.
