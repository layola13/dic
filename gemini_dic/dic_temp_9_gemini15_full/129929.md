WORD ORIGIN->
The word "non-linearly" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), the adjective "linear" (relating to a line or lines), and the adverbial suffix "-ly" (indicating manner or way).  "Linear" itself originates from the Latin word "linearis," derived from "linea" meaning "line."  Therefore, "non-linearly" literally means "not in a straight line" or "not in a directly proportional manner."

It's frequently used in mathematics, physics, computer science, and other fields dealing with complex systems.
