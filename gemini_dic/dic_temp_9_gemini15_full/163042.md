词源:

The word "preclearance" is a compound word formed from the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the noun "clearance" (meaning "the act of removing obstacles or impediments").  The word's meaning thus directly reflects its etymology, signifying an approval or inspection that happens before a main process.
