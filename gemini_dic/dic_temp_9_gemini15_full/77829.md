generativism:/ˈdʒɛnəreɪtɪvɪzəm/| n. |生成主义；生成语法|Generativism is a linguistic theory that focuses on the innate human capacity for language acquisition and the mental processes involved in generating grammatical sentences.  It posits that humans possess an innate "universal grammar" that guides language development. This contrasts with other theories that emphasize the role of environmental factors in language learning.  Generativism also emphasizes the creative aspect of language use, arguing that speakers can produce and understand an infinite number of sentences they have never heard before.|Example:  Chomsky's work is a cornerstone of generativism in linguistics.  生成主义是乔姆斯基著作的基石。|近义词：generative linguistics, nativist linguistics |反义词：empiricism (in linguistics), behaviorism (in linguistics)
