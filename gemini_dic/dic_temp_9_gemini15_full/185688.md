词源:
The word "reverseless" is a relatively modern formation, combining the prefix "re-" (meaning "back" or "again") with the negative prefix "less" and the noun "reverse" (meaning to turn backward or invert).  It implies a state or process that cannot be reversed or undone.  The word is not found in older dictionaries, suggesting its recent coinage to express the concept of an irreversible condition.
