USAGE->
This word is extremely rare and unnatural.  It's a contrived plural form of a word not commonly used itself.  Therefore, providing grammatical examples in various tenses is not practical or meaningful.  The word itself is problematic and should be avoided in favor of clearer alternatives.

PHRASE->
