The word "congaing" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need the intended word.  Is it perhaps a misspelling of a similar-sounding word?  Please provide the correct spelling or more context so I can assist you.
