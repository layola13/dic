joules:/dʒuːlz/| n. |焦耳|The joule (symbol: J) is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units (SI).  It is equal to the energy transferred to (or work done on) an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of its motion through a distance of one metre (1 newton-metre or N⋅m).  It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second.|例句：The kinetic energy of the moving car is measured in joules.  运动汽车的动能以焦耳为单位测量。

The energy released by the explosion was equivalent to thousands of joules. 爆炸释放的能量相当于数千焦耳。|近义词：unit of energy|反义词：无
