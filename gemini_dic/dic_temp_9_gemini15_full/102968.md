词源:

The word "jealousy" originates from the Old French word "jalousie," which itself comes from the Old French "jaloux" meaning "jealous."  The ultimate origin is thought to be from a Latin word related to "zealous," suggesting an original meaning closer to "zeal" or "ardor," but this evolved into the more negative connotation of envious rivalry.
