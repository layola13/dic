词源:

The word "non-programmable" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "programmable" (capable of being programmed).  "Programmable" itself derives from "program," which ultimately comes from the Greek word "programma," meaning "a written notice, a public announcement."  The meaning evolved to refer to a set of instructions for a computer or machine.
