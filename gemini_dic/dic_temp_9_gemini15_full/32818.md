chokebore:/ˈtʃoʊkˌbɔːr/| n. | 缩颈枪管 | A chokebore is a shotgun barrel with a constriction (narrowing) at the muzzle, designed to concentrate the shot pattern and increase its range and accuracy.  It achieves this by constricting the shot as it leaves the barrel, reducing its spread. Different degrees of constriction are available, resulting in different choke patterns. | Example:  The hunter used a shotgun with a modified chokebore to increase the accuracy of his shots at long range. = 猎人使用带有改进型缩颈枪管的猎枪来提高远距离射击的精度。 |近义词: constricted barrel |反义词: cylinder bore
