词源:  The word "multidimensional" is a combination of "multi-" (meaning many) and "dimensional" (relating to dimensions).  "Dimension" comes from the Old French word "dimension," ultimately derived from the Latin "dimensus," the past participle of "dimeti," meaning "to measure out."  Therefore, the word's roots indicate a concept involving multiple measurable aspects.
