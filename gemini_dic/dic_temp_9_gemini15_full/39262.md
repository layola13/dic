词源:
The word "congregator" is derived from the verb "congregate," which comes from the Late Latin word *congregāre*.  This, in turn, is a combination of the prefix "con-" (together) and "gregāre" (to gather, from the noun "grex," meaning flock or herd).  Therefore, "congregator" literally means "one who gathers together" or "one who is gathered together."
