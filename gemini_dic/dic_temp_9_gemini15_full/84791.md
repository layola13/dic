词源:  The word "handsome" originates from Old English "hǣnsum," meaning "handy," "convenient," or "ready to hand."  Over time, its meaning shifted to imply dexterity and skill, then to gracefulness and attractiveness, eventually settling on its current meaning of possessing a pleasing and attractive appearance, especially in a masculine way.  The "hand" element suggests a skilled and well-proportioned physique.
