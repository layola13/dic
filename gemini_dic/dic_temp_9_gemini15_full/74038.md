The word "foryete" does not exist in standard English.  It's likely a misspelling or a word from an archaic or dialectal form of English.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered "foryete."
