词源:
The word "communing" comes from the Old French word "comuniun," meaning "common possession, participation, fellowship."  This in turn derives from the Latin "communio,"  which has the same general sense. The Latin root is "communis," meaning "common."  The sense of spiritual or intimate connection evolved over time.
