/ˈkaʊntərˌskeɪl/ | n. | 对衡，反衡；对比标度 | A counter-scale is a scale used to measure the weight or mass of an object by comparing it to a known weight or mass on the opposite side.  It's often used in analytical balances for precise measurements.  It involves comparing the weight of the unknown object against a known weight to determine its mass. | The chemist used a counter-scale to precisely measure the mass of the chemical sample. = 化学家用对衡精确测量化学样品的质量。  The jeweler employed a counter-scale to weigh the precious stones. = 珠宝商用对衡来称量宝石。 |  balance, scale |  (No direct antonym; the opposite function would be a single-pan scale) | 名词
