oxamate:/ɒkˈsæmeɪt/| n. |草酰胺酸盐|Oxamate is a salt or ester of oxamic acid. It's an inhibitor of several enzymes, notably glutamate dehydrogenase, and is sometimes used in biochemical research.  |Example:  The researchers used oxamate to inhibit glutamate dehydrogenase activity in their experiment.  研究人员在实验中使用草酰胺酸盐来抑制谷氨酸脱氢酶的活性。|近义词:oxamate salt, oxamic acid derivative |反义词: (No direct antonym, as it's a specific chemical compound)|名词
