词源:
The word "confragose" is not found in standard dictionaries and appears to be a relatively rare or newly coined word.  Its formation suggests a combination of elements suggesting "broken" or "fragmented" combined with a prefix implying intensity or completeness.  A likely root is related to the Latin "frangere" (to break), but the exact etymology requires further research into its origin and usage context.
