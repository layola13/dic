The word "lising" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps "listing," "leasing," or another word entirely?  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **A neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word, a term used within a specific community or field, or slang.  If this is the case, please provide more context about where you encountered this word.

3. **A proper noun:**  It could be a name or place name.  Again, more context is needed.


Without further information, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  Please provide the correct spelling or context for a proper response.
