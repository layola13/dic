词源:
The word "morbillous" is a relatively rare word, likely formed by combining the obsolete word "morbus" (meaning "disease" or "illness") with a suffix suggesting intensity, perhaps influenced by words like "tremendous" or "formidable".  While a precise etymology is difficult to definitively trace, its meaning clearly links to something unpleasant and severe.
