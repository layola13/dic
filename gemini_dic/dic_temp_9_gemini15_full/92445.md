hypophosphorous:/ˌhaɪpəˈfɒsfərəs/ | adj. |次磷的；次磷酸的 | Relating to or denoting hypophosphorous acid or its salts.  Hypophosphorous acid is a monobasic acid, meaning it only has one acidic hydrogen atom that can be replaced by a metal to form a salt.  It's a powerful reducing agent. | Example:  Hypophosphorous acid is used as a reducing agent in the synthesis of certain organic compounds. 次磷酸用于某些有机化合物的合成中作为还原剂。|近义词：phosphorous (in some contexts, depending on the specific meaning) |反义词：None directly, but terms like "oxidized" or "less reducing" could be considered opposites in a chemical context.
