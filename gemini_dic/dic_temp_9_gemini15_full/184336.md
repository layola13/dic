词源:

From Middle English *respectif, from Old French respectif, from Latin respectīvus (“relating to respect, regard; respective”), from respectus (“regard, respect”), from respicere (“to look back, consider”), from re- (“back”) + specere (“to look”).


用法说明:

Respective is used to refer to things individually, emphasizing that each item or person has its or his own specific item or role. It is often used with words like "their," "his," "her," or "its" to clarify the individual connection.  It avoids ambiguity when several things or people are mentioned and you want to emphasize that each one is associated with a particular item or attribute.
