词源:
The word "neuropsychology" is a compound word formed from:

* **neuro-**:  From Greek "neuron," meaning "nerve" or "nerve fiber."  This prefix indicates a relationship to the nervous system.
* **psychology**: From Greek "psyche" (soul, mind) and "logia" (study of).  This refers to the scientific study of the mind and behavior.

Therefore, neuropsychology literally means the study of the mind and behavior as related to the nervous system.
