plasticizations:/ˌplæstɪsɪˈzeɪʃənz/ | n. | 增塑作用；增塑；塑化 | The process of making a material more pliable or flexible by adding a plasticizer.  This involves incorporating a substance that reduces the intermolecular forces within the material, increasing its flexibility and workability. | Example: The plasticizations of PVC are crucial for its wide range of applications. 增塑PVC对于其广泛的应用至关重要。 |近义词：softening, flexibilization | 反义词：hardening, stiffening | 名词
