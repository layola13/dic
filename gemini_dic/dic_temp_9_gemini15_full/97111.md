词源:
The word "infidelize" is derived from the word "infidel," meaning an unbeliever or someone who does not share one's faith.  The suffix "-ize" transforms a noun into a verb, signifying "to make or cause to become."  Therefore, "infidelize" literally means "to make unfaithful,"  though it's mainly used in a context of betrayal of trust or a relationship.
