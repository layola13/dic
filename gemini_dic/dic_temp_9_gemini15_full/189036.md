sabellianism: /ˌseɪbəˈliːənɪzəm/ | n. |萨别流 | A type of early Christian heresy that denied the full divinity of Jesus Christ, asserting that he was a created being, subordinate to the Father.  It's named after Sabellius, a theologian of the 3rd century who advocated this belief.  Sabellianism is characterized by modalism, the belief that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are three modes or manifestations of one single divine being, rather than three distinct persons within the Trinity.  | The early church fathers vehemently opposed Sabellianism, ultimately leading to its condemnation as a heresy.  The Council of Nicea (325 AD) and subsequent councils further solidified the doctrine of the Trinity, which explicitly refutes Sabellianism. | Near synonyms: Modalism (a more precise term for the theological aspect), Patripassianism (a related heresy focusing on the Father's suffering). | Antonyms: Trinitarianism (the orthodox Christian belief in three co-equal persons in one God).  | n.
