词源:
The word "gentry" originates from the Old French word "gentil," meaning "noble," "of gentle birth," or "well-born."  This term, in turn, derives from the Latin word "gens," meaning "family," "race," or "tribe."  Over time, "gentry" evolved to denote not only noble birth but also social standing and wealth, particularly land ownership.


用法说明:
The word "gentries" is primarily used in the plural to refer to multiple groups or instances of the gentry class.  It is less common than "gentry" but appropriate when discussing different gentry groups or comparing their characteristics across regions or time periods.  The usage often implies a sense of collective action, shared characteristics, or contrasting differences between various gentry groups.
