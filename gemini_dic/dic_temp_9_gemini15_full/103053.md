The word "jemlah" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis in the requested format.  If you could provide the correct spelling or the language of origin, I can assist you further.
