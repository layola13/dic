词源:

The word "mindful" comes from the Old English word "gemyndig," meaning "mindful, remembering."  It combines the Old English word "ge-" (a prefix indicating intensity or completeness) and "myndig" (meaning "powerful," "mighty," or "remembering").  The modern spelling and meaning evolved over time through Middle English.
