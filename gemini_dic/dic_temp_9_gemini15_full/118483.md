词源:

The word "mesmeric" derives from the name of Franz Mesmer (1734-1815), an Austrian physician who developed a system of therapy known as mesmerism, which involved inducing a trance-like state in patients using passes and suggestion.  While his methods are now considered pseudoscience, the term "mesmeric" remains to describe the captivating or hypnotic quality of something.
