词源:

The phrase is a compound of "final" and "hurrah".

* **final:**  From Old French *final*, from Latin *finalis*. Meaning "of or pertaining to the end."

* **hurrah:** From a Dutch exclamation *hoera*, possibly derived from the Hebrew הוֹרָא (hora) meaning "shout of joy".  It's an exclamation of enthusiastic approval or joy.

The combination creates a noun phrase signifying a celebratory event at the end of something.
