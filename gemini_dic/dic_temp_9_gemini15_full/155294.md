词源:
The word "phantasma" originates from the Greek word φάντασμα (phantasma), meaning "appearance," "phantom," or "specter."  It's related to the verb φαίνεσθαι (phainesthai), meaning "to appear" or "to seem."  The word entered English through Latin and has retained its core meaning of an unreal or ghostly image.
