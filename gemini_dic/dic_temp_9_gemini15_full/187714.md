The word "roop" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a dialect word or slang:**  It might be used informally in a specific region or community.  If you can provide context (e.g., where you encountered the word), I might be able to offer some insights.
* **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or a place name.
* **It's a newly coined word:**  It might be a very recent invention.

Please provide more information so I can assist you better.
