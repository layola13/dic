词源:

The word "insubordinate" comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") + "subordinate" (meaning "placed in a lower rank or position; inferior").  "Subordinate" itself derives from the Latin "subordinatus," the past participle of "subordinare," meaning "to place under," from "sub-" (under) + "ordinare" (to arrange, order).  Therefore, "insubordinate" literally means "not placed in a lower rank; not submissive to authority."
