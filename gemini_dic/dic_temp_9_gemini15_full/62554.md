词源:
The word "energetic" comes from the French word "énergique," which itself is derived from the Greek word "ἐνέργεια" (energeia), meaning "activity," "operation," or "work."  The Greek word is composed of "ἐν" (en), meaning "in," and "ἔργον" (ergon), meaning "work."  Therefore, the root meaning points to "working within" or "inner activity."  The suffix "-ic" is added to form the adjective.
