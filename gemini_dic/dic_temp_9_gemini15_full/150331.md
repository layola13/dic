panhellenium: /ˌpæn.hɛˈliː.ni.əm/ | n. |泛希腊联盟，希腊各邦联盟 | The Panhellenium refers to a league or confederation of Greek states, typically in ancient times.  It often implies a sense of unity or cooperation among various Greek city-states, although this unity was rarely complete or long-lasting. The term suggests a broader, more inclusive Greek identity than that of individual poleis. | Example:  The Olympic Games were originally a Panhellenic event, bringing together athletes from across the Greek world. = 奥运会最初是一项泛希腊赛事，汇集了来自整个希腊世界的运动员。  The concept of a Panhellenium was frequently invoked during periods of external threat, uniting disparate Greek states against a common enemy. = 在面临外部威胁的时期，泛希腊联盟的概念经常被提及，以团结不同的希腊城邦对抗共同的敌人。| 近义词:Greek confederation, Hellenic league | 反义词:  None directly applicable, as it describes a type of political organization, not a quality.
