词源：

The word "reloadable" is derived from the verb "reload" and the suffix "-able."  "Reload" itself comes from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the verb "load," which ultimately traces back to Old English "hlādian," meaning "to load, burden."  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or suitability.  Therefore, "reloadable" literally means "capable of being loaded again."
