词源:  Comes from the verb "confuse," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "confundere," meaning "to pour together," "to mix up," or "to throw into disorder."  The prefix "con-" means "together," and "fundere" means "to pour."  The sense of "mixing up" thoughts or ideas led to the modern meaning of confusing.
