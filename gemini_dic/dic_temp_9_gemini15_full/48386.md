USAGE->
This word is an adverb, not a verb, noun, or adjective.  Therefore, it doesn't conjugate like a verb and doesn't have tenses like the example word "what".  It simply describes location.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "dedans" as it is a simple adverb of location.  Phrases involving location would use other words to specify the location, with "dedans" modifying it.  For example:  "dans la boîte dedans" (in the box inside).
