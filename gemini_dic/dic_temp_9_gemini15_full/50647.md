PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "deritualize".  The word itself is relatively uncommon and academic.  Phrases would involve the use of the word in a descriptive sentence rather than a fixed phrase.  For example: "the process of deritualizing traditions", "attempts to deritualize the ceremony", "a deritualized approach to..." etc.

词源:  The word is a relatively modern formation, a combination of "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse") and "ritualize" (to make something into a ritual).  Therefore, its etymology traces back to the Latin word "ritus" (ritual) and the English suffix "-ize" (to make or become).
