self-tenderness: /ˌsɛlfˈtɛndərnəs/ | n. | 自怜；自我怜惜；自我同情 |

英文解析:Self-tenderness refers to the act of showing compassion and understanding towards oneself, often in times of difficulty or distress.  It involves acknowledging one's own feelings and needs, and treating oneself with kindness and empathy, rather than self-criticism or harsh judgment. It's a form of self-care and can be a crucial aspect of mental and emotional well-being.  However, excessive self-tenderness can sometimes be detrimental, leading to self-indulgence or a lack of personal responsibility.
