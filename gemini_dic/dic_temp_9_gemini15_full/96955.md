词源:  The word "infallibly" is derived from the adjective "infallible," which itself comes from the Old French word "infallible," meaning "incapable of error."  This, in turn, is built from the prefix "in-" (not) + "fallible" (capable of making mistakes).  The root "fall-" relates to deception or failing.
