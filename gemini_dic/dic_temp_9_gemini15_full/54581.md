词源:
The word "dismalities" is derived from the adjective "dismal," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "desmal" meaning "unfortunate" or "ill-starred."  The prefix "dis-" adds a sense of negation or intensification, strengthening the negative connotation.  The "-ities" suffix transforms the adjective into a plural noun, referring to instances or states of being dismal.
