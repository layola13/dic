neostriatum:/ˌneoˈstriːeɪtəm/| n. |新纹状体|The neostriatum is a subcortical structure in the brain that is part of the basal ganglia. It plays a crucial role in motor control, procedural learning, and habit formation. It receives input from various cortical areas and projects to other parts of the basal ganglia, contributing to the complex network that regulates movement and behavior.  Lesions or dysfunction in the neostriatum can lead to various neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.|The neostriatum is implicated in reward processing and decision-making.|The researchers found that damage to the neostriatum impaired the animals' ability to learn new motor skills. = 研究人员发现，新纹状体的损伤会损害动物学习新运动技能的能力。|striatum, caudate nucleus, putamen| (no direct antonym, but dysfunction could be considered an antonym of normal function)|名词
