photomeson: /ˈfoʊtoʊˌmeɪzɑːn/ | n. | 光介子 | A photomeson is a meson produced by the interaction of a photon (a quantum of light) with a nucleus.  This process is called photoproduction.  Photomesons are typically created in high-energy physics experiments involving the bombardment of nuclei with photons.  The specific type of meson produced depends on the energy of the photon and the target nucleus. | Example: The experiment measured the cross-section for photomeson production in various nuclei.  实验测量了各种原子核中光介子产生的截面。| 近义词:  meson (a more general term)| 反义词:  None directly applicable.  The antonym would relate to the absence of meson production.
