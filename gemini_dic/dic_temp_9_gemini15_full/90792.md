词源:  The word is formed by adding the suffix "-lessness" (meaning "without" or "lack of") to the noun "humour" (or "humor" in American English).  "Humour" itself ultimately derives from the Latin word "humor," referring to the bodily fluids believed to affect temperament, and later extended to mean a person's disposition or mood.  The sense of "humour" as the ability to appreciate or express the ludicrous or amusing evolved over time.
