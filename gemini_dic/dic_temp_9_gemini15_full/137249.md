词源:
The word "nonsustainable" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "sustainable."  "Sustainable" ultimately derives from the Latin verb "sustinere," meaning "to hold up," "to support," or "to sustain."  Therefore, "nonsustainable" literally means "not able to be held up" or "not able to be supported" in the long term.
