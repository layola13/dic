endoplastule:/ɛnˈdoʊplæstjuːl/| n. |内胚层|A hollow sphere of cells formed during the early development of some animals, specifically during the process of gastrulation, that eventually gives rise to the endoderm (the innermost germ layer).  It is a stage preceding the gastrula. |The endoplastule is a crucial developmental stage in the formation of the digestive system and other internal organs. |近义词:blastula (a more general term for an early embryonic stage) |反义词:None directly applicable.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The endoplastule develops in certain animal embryos. = 内胚层在某些动物胚胎中发育。
This process forms the endoplastule. = 这个过程形成了内胚层。


一般过去时:
Researchers observed the endoplastule formation. = 研究人员观察到内胚层形成的过程。
The endoplastule stage was completed quickly. = 内胚层阶段很快就完成了。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the endoplastule extensively. = 科学家们已经广泛研究了内胚层。
They have identified key genes involved in endoplastule development. = 他们已经确定了参与内胚层发育的关键基因。


过去完成时:
Before gastrulation, the endoplastule had not yet formed. = 在原肠胚形成之前，内胚层尚未形成。
The cells had already begun to differentiate before the endoplastule was visible. = 在内胚层可见之前，细胞已经开始分化。


将来时:
Further research will explore the mechanisms of endoplastule formation. = 进一步的研究将探索内胚层形成的机制。
We will observe the development of the endoplastule in detail. = 我们将详细观察内胚层的生长发育。


虚拟语气:
If the endoplastule failed to form, development would be severely affected. = 如果内胚层未能形成，发育将受到严重影响。
It would be remarkable to observe the entire endoplastule formation process in real-time. = 能够实时观察整个内胚层形成过程将是一件了不起的事情。


被动语态:
The endoplastule is formed during gastrulation. = 内胚层在原肠胚形成过程中形成。
Key genes involved in endoplastule formation have been identified. = 参与内胚层形成的关键基因已被鉴定。


疑问句:
What are the key genes involved in endoplastule formation? = 参与内胚层形成的关键基因是什么？
How does the endoplastule contribute to the development of the digestive system? = 内胚层如何促进消化系统的发育？


否定句:
The endoplastule is not formed in all animals. = 内胚层并非在所有动物中都形成。
This species does not exhibit a distinct endoplastule stage. = 这个物种没有表现出明显的内胚层阶段。


PHRASE->
endoplastule formation = 内胚层形成
endoplastule development = 内胚层发育
role of the endoplastule = 内胚层的角色
study of the endoplastule = 内胚层的研究
stages of endoplastule = 内胚层的阶段
