The term "pre-Irish" does not exist as a standalone word in standard English dictionaries or linguistic literature.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  The term might be:

* **A neologism:** A newly coined word, perhaps used within a specific context (e.g., historical or archaeological studies) or informally.  Without further context about where you encountered this term, its meaning cannot be determined.
* **A misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of a similar-sounding word or phrase.
* **A regional dialect term:** It's possible this is a word used in a specific region or community.


To provide the requested analysis, I need more information regarding the source and context of "pre-Irish."  For example:

* **Where did you find this word?** (book, article, conversation, etc.)
* **What was the surrounding text or conversation about?**  This context would help determine the intended meaning.

Once I have this information, I can attempt to offer a more accurate analysis, including possible interpretations, etymology (if applicable), and usage examples.
