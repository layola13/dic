词源:
The word "interdependence" is formed from the prefix "inter-" meaning "between" or "among," the word "depend," meaning "to rely on," and the suffix "-ence," which turns the verb into a noun indicating a state or condition.  Therefore, "interdependence" literally means "the state of being dependent on each other."  The root "depend" itself comes from the Old French "dependre," ultimately deriving from Latin "pendere," meaning "to hang."  This original meaning reflects the idea of something hanging or relying on something else for support.
