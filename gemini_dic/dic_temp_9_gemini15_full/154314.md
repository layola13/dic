peritropal: /ˌpɛrɪˈtroʊpəl/ | adj. | 周围营养的；围绕营养的 | Relating to or characterized by peritrophic membrane.  A peritropal membrane is a protective layer secreted by the midgut epithelium of many insects and other invertebrates. It surrounds the food bolus, protecting the gut wall from abrasion and pathogens. | Example: The peritropal membrane plays a crucial role in insect digestion and immunity.  周围营养膜在昆虫的消化和免疫中起着至关重要的作用。|近义词:  (No direct synonyms, as it's a very specific biological term) |反义词: (No direct antonyms)
