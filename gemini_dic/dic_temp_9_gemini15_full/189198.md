词源:
The word "sacrifice" comes from the Old French word "sacrifice," which in turn derives from the Late Latin word "sacrificium."  This Latin word is a compound of "sacer," meaning "sacred" or "holy," and "facere," meaning "to make" or "to do." Therefore, the original meaning was "to make something sacred," referring to the religious ritual of offering something to a deity.  Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass any act of giving something up for a higher purpose or cause.
