词源:  The word is a relatively modern coinage, combining the prefix "inter-" (suggesting within, between, or among) with "fulgent" (shining, radiant).  "Fulgent" itself derives from the Latin "fulgens, fulgentis," the present participle of "fulgere," meaning "to shine."  Therefore, "interfulgent" literally means "shining from within."
