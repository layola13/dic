词源:

The word "Grecque" is a French adjective derived from the word "Grec," which means "Greek."  The feminine form "-que" is used to agree with feminine nouns.  It ultimately traces back to the Latin "Graecus," which itself came from the ancient Greek word for "Greek" (though the exact etymology within Ancient Greek is debated).
