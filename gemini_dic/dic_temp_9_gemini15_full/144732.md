词源:

The word "over-analysis" is a compound word.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "too much" or "excessively," and "analysis" comes from the Greek word "analusis," meaning "a breaking down" or "resolution."  Therefore, "over-analysis" literally means "excessive breaking down" or "excessive resolution."
