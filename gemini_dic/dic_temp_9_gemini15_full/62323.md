词源:
The word "endeavour" comes from the Old French word "endevorer," meaning "to strive," which itself comes from the Old French prefix "en-" (in, into) and the verb "devorer" (to devour, consume).  The modern meaning shifted from a more intense "devouring" effort to a more general sense of striving or trying.
