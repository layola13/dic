USAGE->

He identified as a nonvirgin. = 他自认为不是处女。

Complex Sentence:

PHRASE->
This word doesn't typically form common phrases in the same way as "what". Its usage is generally standalone.  The context in which it's used determines its meaning and impact.  Any phrases would be dependent on the surrounding words and would not be a fixed collocation.  For example, one might say "a nonvirgin woman," but this is simply a descriptive phrase, not a specific idiom.
