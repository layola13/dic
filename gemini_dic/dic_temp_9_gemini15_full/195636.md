semireflexive:/ˌsɛmɪrɪˈflɛksɪv/| adj.| 半自反的 |A semireflexive verb is a verb that takes both a reflexive pronoun (like "himself," "herself," "itself") and a non-reflexive object.  It's a type of verb where the action affects both the subject and a separate object.  The reflexive pronoun clarifies that the subject is also involved in the action.|例句：He bought himself a new car. (He is the subject and the indirect object, 'himself', and 'a new car' is the direct object)  She baked herself a cake. (She is the subject and the indirect object, 'herself', and 'a cake' is the direct object)|近义词：partially reflexive|反义词：reflexive, non-reflexive|


词源:

The word "semireflexive" is a combination of "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partially") and "reflexive" (referring to verbs where the subject and object are the same, or the action reflects back on the subject).  The "reflexive" part derives from Latin "reflexus," the past participle of "reflectere," meaning "to bend back."

用法说明:

Semireflexive verbs are a subtle category of verbs.  They aren't as commonly discussed as strictly reflexive or non-reflexive verbs, but understanding them clarifies the nuances of certain sentence constructions.  The key is the dual nature of the object: one is reflexive, emphasizing the subject's involvement, and the other is a distinct object receiving the action.


例句：

He bought himself a new computer. (他自己买了一台新电脑。)
The chef prepared herself a delicious meal. (厨师为自己准备了一顿美味的饭菜。)


近义词:

Partially reflexive (though "semireflexive" is more precise)

反义词:

Reflexive (where the object is only the reflexive pronoun, e.g., "He washed himself.")
Non-reflexive (where there is no reflexive pronoun, e.g., "He bought a new computer.")


注意：

The distinction between semireflexive and other verb types can sometimes be blurry.  The context and the nature of the verb itself play a crucial role in determining its classification.  Some linguists might argue about specific examples, but the general concept of a verb affecting both the subject and a separate object remains central to the definition of semireflexive.
