词源：
The word "quasi-rational" is a compound word.  "Quasi" is derived from the Latin word "quasi," meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly." "Rational" comes from the Latin word "rationalis," meaning "reasoning," "intellectual," or "logical."  Therefore, "quasi-rational" literally means "almost rational" or "seemingly rational."
