词源:  From Latin *pontificare, from *pons "bridge" + facere "to make". Originally referring to the duties of a Roman pontifex, a high priest responsible for maintaining bridges (symbolically bridging the gap between gods and humans), the meaning evolved to encompass authoritative pronouncements.  The modern sense reflects the often long-winded and self-important nature of such pronouncements.
