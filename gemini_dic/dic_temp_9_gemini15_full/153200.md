The word "pelma" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a neologism:**  It might be a newly coined word, specific to a certain field or community.  If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it might be possible to determine its meaning.
* **It's a word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language.  If you can specify the language of origin, it might be possible to find a translation and explanation.

Please provide more information so I can assist you better.
