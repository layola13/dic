/ˌoʊvərˈsɪvərənəsɪz/ | n. | 过度严厉；过度认真；过分严格 |  The word "overseverenesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a non-standard formation, possibly a humorous or satirical creation, derived from "oversevereness" (itself not a common word) by adding a plural "-es" suffix.  It suggests excessive seriousness or strictness to an absurd degree.  There are no established dictionary entries or common usage for this word.  Therefore, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usages is impossible.  The word would need to be understood within the specific context where it is used.  To illustrate a similar concept with standard English, one might use phrases like "excessive strictness," "unnecessary severity," or "overly rigid rules."
