词源:
The word "ladylike" is a compound adjective formed from "lady" and the suffix "-like," meaning "resembling" or "characteristic of."  "Lady" itself originates from Old English *hlǣfdige, meaning "kneader of bread,"  reflecting the domestic role of women in earlier times. The evolution of the word to its modern sense of a refined woman of high social standing happened gradually over centuries.  The "-like" suffix is a common English derivational suffix indicating similarity or resemblance.
