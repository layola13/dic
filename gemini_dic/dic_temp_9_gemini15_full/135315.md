词源:  The word is formed by the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "patronizing."  "Patronizing" comes from "patron," ultimately from the Latin *patronus, meaning "protector," "advocate," or "sponsor."  Over time, "patronizing" developed its current meaning of treating someone as inferior or condescendingly.  Therefore, "nonpatronizing" directly negates the condescending aspect of the original word.
