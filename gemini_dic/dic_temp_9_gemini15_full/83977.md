half-creole: /ˈhæf ˈkriːoʊl/ | adj. | 半克里奥尔语的；半克里奥尔人的 |  A language that is a blend of a creole language and a standard language, often exhibiting features of both.

The term can also refer to people who have a mixed Creole and non-Creole heritage. | Example:  The local dialect is considered a half-creole, showing influences from both the original Creole language and the official national language.  | 近义词:  mesolect (in sociolinguistics) | 反义词:  acrolect, basilect
