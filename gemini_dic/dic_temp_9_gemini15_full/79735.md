The word "gluier" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "gluey," "glimmer," or a similar-sounding word?

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, a technical term, or slang used within a specific community.  If you encountered it in a particular context, providing that context would be helpful.

3. **It's a word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.
