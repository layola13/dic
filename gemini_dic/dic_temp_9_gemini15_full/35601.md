词源:

The word "coarsest" is the superlative form of the adjective "coarse."  "Coarse" ultimately derives from the Old French word "cors," meaning "body," or more specifically,  "a body of grain (or other material)." This reflects the original sense of "coarse" relating to something having a rough, unrefined texture, like unprocessed grain.  The meaning later broadened to encompass roughness of manner or behavior.
