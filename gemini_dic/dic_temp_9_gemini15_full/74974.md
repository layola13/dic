fricatives:/ˈfrɪkətɪvz/ | n. |摩擦音|Fricatives are consonants produced by forcing air through a narrow channel in the vocal tract, creating friction.  This contrasts with plosives, where airflow is completely stopped and then released.  The sound produced is continuous, unlike plosives which are transient. Examples include /f/, /v/, /θ/, /ð/, /s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /h/ in English. | Examples: The sounds /s/ in "sun" and /z/ in "zoo" are fricatives. The "th" sounds in "thin" (/θ/) and "this" (/ð/) are also fricatives.  The /f/ in "fan" and /v/ in "van" are further examples. |近义词:spirants (a less common term)|反义词:plosives, stops|名词

词源:
The word "fricative" comes from the Latin word "fricare," meaning "to rub."  This reflects the nature of the sound production, which involves the friction of air against the articulators.
