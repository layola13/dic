词源:
The word "rendering" comes from the Old French word "rendrement," which means "yielding, giving back, returning."  This in turn comes from the verb "rendre," meaning "to give back, to return, to restore, to translate."  The English word retains this multifaceted meaning, encompassing the act of giving, translating, and producing a representation.
