The word "intera" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word?  Please double-check the spelling.
2. **It's a technical term:** It might be jargon specific to a particular field (science, technology, etc.).  If you can provide context (where you encountered the word), it might be possible to determine its meaning.
3. **It's a newly coined word:**  It's possible it's a newly invented or very rarely used word.

To provide the analysis you requested, I need a valid English word.  Please provide the correct spelling or more context.
