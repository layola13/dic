fissional:/ˈfɪʒənəl/| adj.|裂变的；分裂的；分离的|Relating to or caused by fission, especially nuclear fission.  The word describes something related to the process of splitting something into smaller parts, particularly in the context of nuclear physics.|例句：The fissional process releases a tremendous amount of energy. 裂变过程释放出巨大的能量。
例句：The fissional products of uranium are highly radioactive. 铀的裂变产物具有高度放射性。|近义词：splitting, dividing, fragmenting|反义词：fusion, uniting, merging|形容词
