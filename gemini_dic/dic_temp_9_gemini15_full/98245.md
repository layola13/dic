词源:

* **in-**:  prefix meaning "not" or "without"
* **sens-**: from Latin "sentire", meaning "to feel" or "to perceive"
* **-itive**: suffix forming adjectives meaning "having the nature of"
* **-ity**: suffix forming nouns meaning "the state or quality of"

Therefore, "insensitivity" literally means "the state or quality of not being sensitive."  The word developed through the evolution of Latin "sentire" into Old French "sentir" and then into Middle English "sensible" and its derivatives.
