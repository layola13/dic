protosomite:/ˈproʊtoʊˌsoʊmaɪt/| n. |原体节，原节|A protosomite is an early embryonic segment in the development of some animals, particularly annelids and arthropods.  These segments are not yet fully differentiated and represent the precursors to the definitive body segments of the adult organism. They are characterized by the presence of a coelomic cavity and a pair of nephridia (excretory organs) in some cases.  The protosomites eventually give rise to the segmented body plan of the adult animal. |例句：The development of protosomites in the annelid embryo is a complex process involving cell proliferation and differentiation. =环节动物胚胎中原体节的发育是一个复杂的过程，涉及细胞增殖和分化。


The study of protosomite formation provides insights into the genetic mechanisms underlying segmentation. =对原体节形成的研究为了解构成分割的遗传机制提供了见解。|近义词：somite (in a later stage of development), segment, metamere |反义词：N/A
