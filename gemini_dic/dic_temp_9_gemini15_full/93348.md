Etymology:

The word "illecebrous" originates from the Late Latin word "illecebrosus," which itself is derived from "illecebra," meaning "enticement" or "allurement."  The prefix "il-" (in this context, not the negative "il-") is an intensifying prefix,  similar to the way "in-" can function in words like "incite" (to stir up). Thus, the word's core meaning centers on the power of strong attraction or temptation.
