词源：

The word "sepulchre" comes from the Old French "sepulcre," which in turn derives from the Latin "sepulcrum," meaning "tomb" or "grave."  The Latin word itself is related to the verb "sepelire," meaning "to bury."  Thus, the word's etymology directly links it to the act of burial and the place where the deceased are interred.
