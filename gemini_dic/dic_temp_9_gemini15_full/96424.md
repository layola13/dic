词源：

* **in-**:  prefix meaning "not" or "without"
* **dissolubl-**: derived from "dissoluble," meaning capable of being dissolved or separated.
* **-ness**: suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.

Therefore, "indissolublenesses" literally means "the state of not being dissolvable" or "the state of being impossible to dissolve or separate."  The plural form suggests multiple instances or aspects of this indissolubility.
