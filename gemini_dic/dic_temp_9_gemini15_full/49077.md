dehydrogenate:/ˌdiːˈhaɪdrədʒəneɪt/ | vt. |脱氢；使脱氢 | To remove hydrogen from (a compound).  This process often involves the removal of two hydrogen atoms, resulting in the formation of a double bond or a ring structure. Dehydrogenation is a common reaction in organic chemistry and is often used in the industrial production of various chemicals. |例句：The catalyst dehydrogenates the alcohol to form an aldehyde.  催化剂使醇脱氢生成醛。

The platinum catalyst dehydrogenates cyclohexane to benzene. 铂催化剂使环己烷脱氢生成苯。


近义词：dehydrate (although this refers to the removal of water, not specifically hydrogen) | 反义词：hydrogenate
