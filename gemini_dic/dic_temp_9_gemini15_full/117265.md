词源：
The word "mechanised" comes from the verb "mechanize," which itself derives from the noun "mechanism."  "Mechanism" originates from the Late Latin word "mechanismus," which in turn comes from the Greek word "mēkhanē" (μηχανή), meaning "machine," "contrivance," or "device." The "-ised" suffix indicates the process of becoming or being made something.
