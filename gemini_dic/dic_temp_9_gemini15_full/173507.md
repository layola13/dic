词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," "almost," or "somewhat."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation.
* **forgotten**: Past participle of the verb "to forget," ultimately from Old English *forgietan*,  meaning "to forget".


The word "quasi-forgotten" is a relatively modern compound, combining a Latin prefix with a Germanic root to create a nuanced description of partial forgetting.
