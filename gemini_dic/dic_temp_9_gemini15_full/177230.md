词源:  The word "reasonedly" is derived from the adjective "reasonable," which comes from the Old French "resnable" and ultimately from the Latin "rationabilis," meaning "capable of being reasoned." The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner in which something is done.
