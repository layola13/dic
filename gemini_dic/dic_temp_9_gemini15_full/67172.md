词源:
The word "expostulator" is derived from the verb "expostulate," which comes from the Late Latin *expostulatus, the past participle of *expostulare.  *Expostulare is formed from the prefix "ex-" (out, from) and "postulare" (to demand, request, claim).  Therefore, the original meaning is to demand something strongly, often in protest.  The modern sense emphasizes the strong disapproval and argumentative aspect.
