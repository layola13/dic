词源:  The word is a relatively modern coinage, combining "death" with the suffix "-ling," which often denotes a small or insignificant thing, or something in a state of becoming.  The "-ling" suffix adds a connotation of weakness or vulnerability to the concept of death.  Therefore, a "deathling" is not simply someone who is dead, but someone in the process of dying, hence implying a fragile state.
