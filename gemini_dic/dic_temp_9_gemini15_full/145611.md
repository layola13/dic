词源:

The word "overconservatism" is a compound word.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "too much," "excessively," or "beyond." "Conservatism" derives from the word "conservative," ultimately from the Latin "conservare" (to preserve, keep safe).  Therefore, overconservatism literally means "excessive preservation" or "excessive adherence to traditional values."
