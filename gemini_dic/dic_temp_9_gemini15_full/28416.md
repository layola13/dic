carbonisable: /ˈkɑːrbənɪzəbl/ | adj. | 可碳化的；能碳化的 | Capable of being converted into carbon or a carbon compound.  This typically refers to materials that can be charred or transformed through a process involving carbonization, often involving high temperatures. | The wood is carbonisable at high temperatures, turning into charcoal. 这木材在高温下可碳化，变成木炭。 |  charrable, coking | uncarbonisable
