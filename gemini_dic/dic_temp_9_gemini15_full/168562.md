The word "procere" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a word from a very specialized or archaic vocabulary, or a word from a different language.  If you can provide more context (e.g., the source where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer further assistance.
