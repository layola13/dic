词源:
The verb "fratted" is derived from the shortened form "frat," which is slang for "fraternity."  The word "fraternity" comes from the Latin word "fraternitas," meaning "brotherhood."  Therefore, "fratted" essentially means "acted like a member of a fraternity" or "engaged in fraternity activities."
