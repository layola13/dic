近义词：Romany, traveler, nomad|反义词：settled, stationary|词性：名词


词源：The word "gipsy" ultimately derives from "Egyptian."  In the Middle Ages, these nomadic groups were mistakenly believed to have originated in Egypt, leading to the adoption of this term.  The term is now widely considered offensive and outdated due to its association with negative stereotypes and a history of discrimination against the Romani people.  The preferred term is now "Roma" or "Romany."


用法说明：

虽然"gipsy"在过去常被使用，但如今被广泛认为是冒犯性的。使用这个词语可能会对罗姆人造成冒犯，因为它与负面刻板印象和歧视的历史有关。  在正式和非正式场合，都应避免使用"gipsy"。  应使用更尊重和准确的替代词，如"Roma"或"Romany"，以指代罗姆人。
