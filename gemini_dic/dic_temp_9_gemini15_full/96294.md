词源:
From Middle French *indigence, from Latin *indigentia, from indigere "to be in need of," from in- "in" + digeri "to distribute, arrange."  The connection to "digest" is etymological rather than semantic; the sense evolved from "to arrange, distribute" to "to need" as the need for resources was viewed as something to be arranged or distributed.
