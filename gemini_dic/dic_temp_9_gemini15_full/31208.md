2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name (person, place, or thing) or a brand name.  More context is needed.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or subculture.  Again, context is crucial.

4. **It's a word from another language:** It might be a loanword from another language that hasn't been fully integrated into English.  If you can provide the language of origin, it might be possible to offer a translation and explanation.
