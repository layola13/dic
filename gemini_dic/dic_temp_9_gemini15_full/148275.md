USAGE->
This word is a noun, and its usage is primarily descriptive, focusing on the excessive application of smoothing techniques.  Therefore, tense conjugations (present, past, future, etc.) do not directly apply to the word itself, but rather to the verbs describing the actions leading to the oversmoothnesses.  For example:

The excessive smoothing caused many oversmoothnesses. (Past tense describing the cause of the noun)
The photographer avoids oversmoothnesses by using less filtering. (Present tense describing a preventative action)


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "oversmoothnesses." The word itself is relatively rare and highly specific to technical fields like image processing or manufacturing.  It's more likely to appear in a descriptive sentence rather than a phrase.
