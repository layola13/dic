collineation:/ˌkɒlɪniˈeɪʃən/ | n. |共线变换；直线变换|A collineation is a transformation of a projective space that maps lines to lines.  It preserves the collinearity of points; that is, if three points are collinear before the transformation, they remain collinear after the transformation. In simpler terms, it's a geometric transformation that keeps straight lines straight. |Example:  In projective geometry, collineations are fundamental transformations preserving incidence relations.  In projective geometry, a collineation is a bijective mapping that preserves collinearity. |近义词：projective transformation, linear transformation |反义词：None specifically, but transformations that don't preserve collinearity could be considered opposites. |名词
