词源:

The word "countrywoman" is a compound word formed from "country" and "woman."

* **Country:**  From Old French "countree," meaning "district, region," ultimately from Latin "contrata," a feminine form of "contratus," meaning "opposite, situated across."  This evolved to mean the land of one's birth or residence.

* **Woman:** From Old English "wifman," a compound of "wif" (wife) and "man."  The "wif" element itself has Germanic roots.
