词源:The term "longheaded" originates from the metaphorical association of a long head with stubbornness or slowness of intellect. While there isn't a direct historical etymology tracing its use back to a specific time, the imagery suggests a head that is "long" in its resistance to change or in its slowness of thought.  The "long" doesn't refer to physical head size, but rather to the length of time it takes to change someone's mind or for them to understand something.
