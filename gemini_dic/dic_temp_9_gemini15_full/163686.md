predeclarations:/ˌpriːˌdekləˈreɪʃənz/ | n. |预声明；预先声明 |The act of declaring something beforehand, typically in a programming context, where variables or functions are declared before they are used.  This improves code readability and allows for better error detection during compilation. |Example:  The compiler flagged an error due to the absence of predeclarations for several crucial functions. = 编译器由于缺少几个关键函数的预声明而标记了一个错误。|近义词：forward declarations, prior declarations |反义词：post-declarations


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the context of computer programming and does not have common usage in general English grammar.  Therefore, verb conjugation examples are not applicable.  The usage below illustrates the concept in programming contexts.

Example 1 (C++):
```c++
// Predeclaration of a function
int add(int a, int b);

int main() {
  int sum = add(5, 3); // Function call before its definition
  return 0;
}

// Function definition
int add(int a, int b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
This demonstrates the use of predeclaration in C++. The `add` function is declared before its definition in `main()`, allowing its use before the compiler encounters the full function definition.


Example 2 (General programming concept):
Predeclarations help avoid circular dependencies between modules or files in a large software project.  By declaring a function's signature upfront, other parts of the project can use the function without needing to know its complete implementation details.  This improves modularity and maintainability. = 预声明有助于避免大型软件项目中模块或文件之间的循环依赖关系。通过预先声明函数的签名，项目的其他部分可以使用该函数，而无需了解其完整的实现细节。这提高了模块化和可维护性。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "predeclarations".  The term is technical and specific to computer science.
