semiphenomenally: /ˌsɛmiˌfɛnəˈmɛnəli/ | adj. | 半现象地；部分现象地 |  Describes something that is partially or imperfectly phenomenal;  exhibiting characteristics of a phenomenon but not fully or completely.  It suggests an incomplete or partial manifestation of a phenomenon.  The word combines "semi" (half, partly) and "phenomenal" (remarkable, extraordinary, a phenomenon).  There are few established usages of this word, as it is quite rare and often considered neologistic (newly coined).  Its meaning is derived from its component parts. |  The experiment yielded semiphenomenally successful results; some aspects were clearly phenomenal, while others were less so. = 实验结果部分成功，有些方面非常显著，而另一些则不然。 | 近义词: partially phenomenal, incompletely phenomenal | 反义词: completely phenomenal, fully phenomenal | 形容词
