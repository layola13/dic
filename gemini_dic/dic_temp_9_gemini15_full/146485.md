overfurthest: /ˌoʊvərˈfɜːrðɪst/ | adj. |最远的，最遥远的 |  This word is not a standard English word. It's a nonce word, meaning it's coined for a specific occasion and not part of common vocabulary. It seems to be formed by combining "over" and "furthest," intending to emphasize extreme distance. However, its usage is incorrect and unnatural.  Instead of "overfurthest,"  "farthest" or "most distant" would be appropriate. | Example: (Incorrect usage) The overfurthest star in the galaxy is barely visible. | 近义词: farthest, most distant, remotest | 反义词: nearest, closest | 词性: adjective
