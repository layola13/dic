This word is not found in standard dictionaries.  It appears to be a non-standard formation, created by adding the suffix "-nesses" (a pluralizing suffix indicating a state or condition) to "overgreasiness," which itself is a non-standard word formed by adding the prefix "over-" to "greasiness."


Therefore, a comprehensive grammatical analysis like the one requested for a standard word is not possible.  The word is understandable based on its constituent parts, but it lacks established usage and grammatical structures to analyze.  It's a colloquialism or a neologism (newly coined word) not suitable for formal writing.

Because it is a nonce word (a word invented for a single occasion),  the  USAGE, PHRASE sections are inapplicable.
