semiplume: /ˈsemiˌpluːm/ | n. | 半羽, 半羽毛状物 | A semiplume is a type of feather intermediate between a down feather and a plume feather. It is characterized by a central shaft with barbs that are loosely connected or unattached at the tip, giving it a fluffy or plume-like appearance but lacking the full, continuous barbules of a plume feather.  Semiplumes are often found on birds in areas providing insulation or aiding in streamlining. | Example:  The bird's breast was covered in soft, fluffy semiplumes providing excellent insulation. = 这只鸟的胸部覆盖着柔软蓬松的半羽，提供了极好的保温效果。 The owl's semiplumes helped to reduce wind resistance during flight. = 猫头鹰的半羽有助于减少飞行过程中的风阻。|近义词: down feather, plume (in part)|反义词: contour feather, flight feather |
