词源:

The term "jet-setter" is a relatively modern coinage, arising in the mid-20th century with the advent of widespread commercial jet travel.  It combines "jet" (referring to jet aircraft) and "setter," suggesting someone who sets the pace or trend, often in a fashionable or glamorous way.  The "-er" suffix indicates a person who performs the action.
