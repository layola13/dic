/ˌretrəʊvæksɪˈneɪʃən/ | n. |逆向疫苗接种，反向疫苗接种 | Retro vaccination refers to a hypothetical method of vaccination where a weakened or attenuated form of a virus is introduced into the body, not to prevent future infection, but to treat an existing infection by stimulating the immune system to fight the virus more effectively.  This is distinct from traditional vaccination, which aims to prevent disease.  The concept is largely theoretical and not yet a widely accepted or practiced medical procedure.  |  The research team is exploring the possibility of retrovaccination as a novel treatment for the virus.  逆向疫苗接种的研究团队正在探索将其作为一种新型病毒治疗方法的可能性。 |  (No established synonyms or antonyms; the concept is too novel) | n.
