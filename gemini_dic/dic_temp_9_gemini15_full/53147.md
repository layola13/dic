词源:

The word "diplomatist" comes from the word "diplomacy," which ultimately derives from the Greek word "diploma" (δίπλωμα), meaning "a folded document," specifically referring to official documents issued by rulers or authorities.  The evolution of the term reflects the historical role of official letters and documents in international relations.  The "-ist" suffix indicates a person who practices or is skilled in a particular activity.
