词源:

re- (prefix): again, back
in- (prefix): in, into
duce (verb): to cause, to persuade, to lead


The word "reinduce" combines the prefix "re-" indicating repetition, the prefix "in-" suggesting a process of leading into, and the verb "duce" (from Latin *ducere, meaning "to lead"). Therefore, "reinduce" means to lead or cause something to happen again.
