词源:

The word "mindfulness" is a relatively modern term, derived from the Pali word "sati," which means "remembering" or "awareness."  Buddhist traditions have long emphasized sati as a key element in meditation and spiritual practice. The English word gained prominence in the West through the spread of Buddhist meditation practices and the increasing interest in psychology and well-being.
