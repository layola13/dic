nonpsychoanalytical: /ˌnɒnˌsaɪkoʊæˌnælɪtɪkəl/ | adj. | 非精神分析的 | Not relating to or based on the theories of psychoanalysis.  This adjective describes approaches, methods, or interpretations that do not originate from or utilize the principles of psychoanalysis.


英文解析:The term "nonpsychoanalytical" directly opposes "psychoanalytical."  Psychoanalysis, a theory developed by Sigmund Freud, emphasizes the unconscious mind's role in shaping behavior and personality.  A nonpsychoanalytical approach would therefore disregard or downplay the influence of unconscious drives, repressed memories, and the interpretation of dreams, focusing instead on other factors.


例句:

His approach to therapy was decidedly nonpsychoanalytical, focusing instead on behavioral modification techniques. = 他对治疗的方法绝对是非精神分析的，而是专注于行为矫正技术。

The study employed a nonpsychoanalytical framework, analyzing the data through a purely sociological lens. = 这项研究采用了非精神分析的框架，通过纯粹的社会学视角来分析数据。
