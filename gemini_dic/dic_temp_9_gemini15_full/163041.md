The word "precleans" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a newly coined word, a misspelling, or a word specific to a particular technical field or jargon.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and detailed grammatical explanation are impossible.  To provide a response, we need to consider the possible interpretations:

**Possible Interpretation 1:  A Combination of "pre-" and "cleans"**

If "precleans" is intended as a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and the verb "cleans," it would function as a verb meaning "to clean beforehand" or "to clean in preparation."
