词源:
The word "cocaptain" is a compound word formed by combining "co-" (meaning "together" or "jointly") and "captain" (meaning the leader of a team or group).  Therefore, it literally means "together captain" or "joint captain".  Its etymology traces back to the Latin prefix "com-" (meaning "with" or "together"), which evolved into "co-" in English, and the word "captain," ultimately derived from the Latin "capitaneus,"  related to the head or chief.
