词性:形容词

词源:源自hen (母鸡) + -ish (形容词后缀，表示“具有…的性质”)，字面意思是“像母鸡一样的”。  The suffix "-ish" adds a quality or characteristic to the base word, indicating a resemblance or partial possession of that quality.  Thus, "hennish" implies possessing qualities associated with hens, particularly their protective and sometimes overbearing nature.
