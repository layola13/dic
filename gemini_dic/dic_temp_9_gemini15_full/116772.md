词源:
The word "mauveine" originates from the French word "mauve," meaning mallow, a plant with purple flowers.  The name was given to the first synthetic dye, created by William Henry Perkin in 1856, because of its mauve-like color.  The suffix "-ine" is a common chemical suffix indicating a substance.
