pederast:/ˈpɛdəræst/| n. |恋童癖者|A pederast is an adult who is sexually attracted to young boys.  The term is often used in a pejorative and clinical sense, emphasizing the predatory nature of the sexual attraction.  It carries significant negative connotations and is generally avoided in favor of more neutral or clinical terms.  Note that the term's usage can be controversial, as it has been historically associated with specific cultural contexts and interpretations. |例句：The convicted pederast was sentenced to a lengthy prison term.  这个被判有罪的恋童癖者被判处长期监禁。

The term "pederast" is increasingly replaced with "child molester" or "child sexual abuser" in legal and clinical contexts to avoid the ambiguity and potential for misinterpretation. |近义词：child molester, child abuser, pedophile (though pedophile is broader and encompasses attraction to prepubescent children of both sexes)|反义词：None directly, but terms implying healthy sexual relationships with age-appropriate partners could be considered antonyms in a broad sense.

词源:
The word "pederast" comes from the Greek words "pais" (παις), meaning "boy," and "erastes" (ἐραστής), meaning "lover."  Therefore, it literally means "boy-lover."  The term's usage has evolved over time, and its modern connotations are predominantly negative and associated with criminal behavior.
