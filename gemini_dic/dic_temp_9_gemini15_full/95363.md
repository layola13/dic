词源：

The word "incertum" comes directly from classical Latin.  It is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the past participle stem of the verb "cerno" (meaning "to separate," "to distinguish," or "to discern"). Therefore, "incertum" literally means "not separated," "not distinguished," or "not discerned," leading to its meaning of uncertainty.


用法说明：

In modern usage, "incertum" is primarily used in academic contexts, particularly when discussing Latin literature, history, or philosophy. It’s rarely used in everyday conversation.  Its meaning and usage are similar to its English equivalents like "uncertain," "doubtful," and "unknown."  It adds a certain scholarly or classical flair when employed.  You would not typically find it in a casual setting.
