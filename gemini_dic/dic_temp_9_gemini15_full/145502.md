词源:
The word "overcloy" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "cloy," which means "to fill or satisfy to excess."  "Cloy" itself originates from the Old French word "cloier," meaning "to close, nail, fasten," suggesting a sense of being filled up to the point of being closed off or blocked.
