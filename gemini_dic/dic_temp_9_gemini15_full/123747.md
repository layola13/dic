The word "moonwalking" is a relatively recent coinage, combining "moon" (referencing the visual similarity to walking on the moon) and "walking". Its popularization is directly linked to Michael Jackson's iconic dance move.  The specific origin of the term is difficult to pinpoint precisely, but its association with Jackson cemented its meaning.
