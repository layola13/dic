gamomorphism:/ˌɡæməˈmɔːrfɪzəm/ | n. |同态映射|In mathematics, a gamomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type.  It's a generalization of the concept of a homomorphism, often used in contexts where the algebraic structures involved might not be groups, rings, or fields, but possess a similar structure. For example, it can be applied to partially ordered sets or other similar structures.  The precise definition depends on the specific type of algebraic structure being considered.  |Example: In the context of partially ordered sets, a gamomorphism is a map that preserves the order relation. If a ≤ b, then f(a) ≤ f(b). |近义词: homomorphism (in some contexts), morphism |反义词:  There isn't a direct antonym; the concept of "non-gamomorphism" would simply mean a map that doesn't preserve the relevant structure.|名词
