词源:  The word "fair" in this context originates from Old English "fæger," meaning "beautiful, pleasing, bright."  Over time, it came to describe light-colored hair, skin, and complexions, reflecting a historical association with beauty ideals in certain cultures. "Haired" is simply the past participle of "hair," indicating possession or description of hair.
