The word "griezenberg" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible. It's likely a proper noun (perhaps a surname or place name), a misspelling, or a word from a niche field or dialect not widely documented.  To provide the requested information, I would need more context on where you encountered this word.
