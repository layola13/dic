prevegetation:/ˌpriːˌvɛdʒɪˈteɪʃən/| n. |先期植被，先锋植被|Vegetation that precedes a later, more mature community.  It often consists of hardy, fast-growing species that colonize disturbed or newly exposed areas.  Prevegetation plays a crucial role in soil formation and habitat development.|Example: The prevegetation on the volcanic slopes consisted primarily of lichens and mosses.|近义词：pioneer vegetation, early vegetation|反义词：climax vegetation
