词源:

The word "non-subordinate" is a compound word.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "subordinate" comes from the Latin words "sub-" (under) and "ordinare" (to arrange, order).  Therefore, "subordinate" means "placed under" or "of lower rank," and "non-subordinate" logically means "not placed under" or "not of lower rank".
