curie:/ˈkjʊəri/| n. |居里(单位)|The curie (Ci) is a non-SI unit of radioactivity, defined as 3.7 × 10<sup>10</sup> disintegrations per second.  It is named after Marie Curie, a pioneering researcher in radioactivity.|Example: The radioactive source had an activity of 10 curies.|近义词: becquerel (SI unit)|反义词:  None (it's a unit, not a concept with an antonym)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The sample emits 5 curies of radiation. = 样本释放5居里的辐射。
This device measures radioactivity in curies. = 此设备用居里测量放射性。


一般过去时:
The old reactor produced thousands of curies. = 旧反应堆产生数千居里。
Scientists measured the curie levels carefully. = 科学家仔细测量了居里水平。


现在完成时:
They have detected high curie levels near the site. = 他们在该地点附近探测到高居里水平。
Researchers have used curies as a unit for decades. = 研究人员几十年来一直使用居里作为单位。


过去完成时:
Before the accident, the plant had emitted only a few curies. = 事故发生前，工厂只释放了几居里。
The scientists had already measured the curies before the report was published. = 在报告发表之前，科学家们已经测量了居里。


将来时:
The new reactor will produce millions of curies. = 新反应堆将产生数百万居里。
We will need more sensitive instruments to measure lower curie levels. = 我们需要更灵敏的仪器来测量更低的居里水平。


虚拟语气:
If the sample contained more curies, the results would be different. = 如果样本含有更多居里，结果就会不同。
I wish we had known the curie levels beforehand. = 我希望我们事先知道居里水平。


被动语态:
The curies were measured using a Geiger counter. = 居里是用盖革计数器测量的。
The radiation levels were calculated in curies. = 辐射水平是用居里计算的。


疑问句:
How many curies are present in the sample? = 样本中存在多少居里？
What is the curie level of this material? = 这种材料的居里水平是多少？


否定句:
The sample did not contain significant curies. = 样本不含大量的居里。
The instrument could not measure such low curie levels. = 仪器无法测量如此低的居里水平。


PHRASE->
curie measurement = 居里测量
curie level = 居里水平
millicurie (mCi) = 毫居里
microcurie (µCi) = 微居里
kilocurie (kCi) = 千居里
