USAGE->  This word is a noun and therefore doesn't conjugate like verbs.  It is used in the same way as other plural nouns.


PHRASE->  There are no common phrases directly using "groundlessnesses". The concept is expressed through phrases related to lacking evidence or justification.  Examples:

lack of evidence:  缺乏证据
baseless claims: 无稽之谈
without foundation:  毫无根据
no supporting evidence: 没有支持性证据
unsubstantiated allegations:  未经证实的指控

词源:

The word derives from "groundless" + "-ness" (suffix indicating a state or quality) + "-es" (plural suffix).  "Groundless" itself comes from "ground" (meaning basis or foundation) + "-less" (suffix indicating lack of).  Therefore, "groundlessnesses" means multiple instances of lacking a basis or foundation.
