genotype:/ˈdʒiːnəʊtaɪp/| n. |基因型|The genetic constitution of an individual organism.  It refers to the specific alleles or gene variants an organism possesses at a particular locus or set of loci.  This is distinct from the phenotype, which is the observable physical or biochemical characteristics of an organism. | Example:  The genotype of a pea plant might be homozygous dominant (TT) for tallness or heterozygous (Tt).  The genotype determines the phenotype, but the phenotype can also be influenced by environmental factors. |近义词：genetic makeup, genome (broader term) |反义词：phenotype


USAGE->
一般现在时:
His genotype determines his susceptibility to the disease. = 他的基因型决定了他对这种疾病的易感性。

将来时:

虚拟语气:
If the genotype were different, the phenotype might also be different. = 如果基因型不同，表型也可能不同。
It is hypothesized that if the genotype had been altered, the outcome of the experiment would have been different. = 假设如果基因型被改变，实验结果将会不同。


被动语态:

The genotypes of the participants were carefully screened before the clinical trial. = 在临床试验之前，参与者的基因型经过仔细筛选。


疑问句:
What is the genotype of this individual? = 这个人的基因型是什么？
What are the different genotypes possible for this gene? = 对于这个基因来说，有哪些不同的基因型？


否定句:
The genotype did not predict the phenotype accurately in this case. = 在这种情况下，基因型并没有准确地预测表型。
The researchers found that the genotype was not associated with the disease. = 研究人员发现基因型与该疾病无关。
