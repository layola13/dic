近义词：permanence, immutability, inseparability, steadfastness

反义词：solubility, dissolvability, separability, breakability

词源：

* **in-**:  prefix meaning "not" or "without"
* **dis-**: prefix meaning "not" or "apart"
* **solv-**:  from Latin "solvere," meaning "to loosen," "to dissolve," or "to solve."
* **-ible**: suffix making an adjective, meaning "capable of being"
* **-ity**: suffix making a noun, meaning "the state or quality of"

Therefore, "indissolubility" literally means "the state of not being able to be dissolved or separated."  The "dis-" prefix is redundant given the "in-" prefix, but it emphasizes the impossibility of dissolution.
