词源:
The word "cardboard" emerged in the 18th century, a combination of "card" (referring to playing cards, which were made from a similar material) and "board," signifying its sheet-like nature.  The evolution reflects the material's initial similarity to playing cards, but its development into a thicker, more robust material for various applications.
