词源:
The word "depressive" comes from the verb "depress," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "deprimere," meaning "to press down."  The prefix "de-" means "down," and "primere" means "to press."  Thus, "depressive" originally meant something that pressed down, both physically and metaphorically.  Its application to mental states developed later, reflecting the feeling of being weighed down by sadness and despair.
