The word "quartene" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible it's:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps a word related to quarantine (quarantine)?  Please double-check the spelling.
* **A neologism or technical term:** It might be a newly coined word, a word specific to a particular field, or a word from a dialect not widely recognized.  If you encountered this word in a specific context, please provide that context so I can better understand its meaning.
* **A proper noun:** It might be a name or a place name.
