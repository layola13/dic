presocial: /ˌpriːˈsoʊʃəl/ | adj. |前社会性的，准社会性的 |  Relating to or denoting a stage of development in social insects or animals in which individuals show some social behavior but are not fully integrated into a social structure.  This often involves some degree of aggregation or cooperation, but lacks the complex organization and division of labor seen in eusocial species.  |例句：Many solitary insects exhibit presocial behavior, such as parental care or aggregation for overwintering. 许多独居昆虫表现出前社会性行为，例如亲代抚育或越冬聚集。


The presocial stage is considered a stepping stone towards eusociality. 前社会阶段被认为是通向真社会性的垫脚石。|近义词：protosocial, subsocial |反义词：eusocial
