hypercarbureted:/ˌhaɪpərˈkɑːrbjʊreɪtɪd/ | adj. | 富碳的；碳过量的 |  Containing or relating to an excessive amount of carbon or hydrocarbons, especially in fuel. This term is primarily used in the context of internal combustion engines, where it describes a fuel mixture with an abnormally high proportion of fuel to air.  An engine running on hypercarbureted fuel will often run rich, resulting in incomplete combustion and potential problems. | The hypercarbureted mixture caused the engine to sputter and misfire.  富碳混合物导致发动机发出噼啪声和失火。| rich, fuel-rich | lean, stoichiometric |


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The engine runs poorly with a hypercarbureted mixture. = 发动机在富碳混合物下运转不良。
Hypercarbureted fuel often leads to incomplete combustion. = 富碳燃料通常会导致燃烧不完全。

一般过去时:
The mechanic diagnosed the problem as a hypercarbureted fuel mixture. = 技工诊断问题是富碳燃料混合物。
The car ran poorly because it was hypercarbureted. = 汽车运转不良是因为它碳过量。

现在完成时:
The technician has determined that the engine has been running on a hypercarbureted mixture. = 技术人员已经确定发动机一直在使用富碳混合物运转。
The excess fuel has resulted in a hypercarbureted condition. = 燃油过量导致了富碳状态。


过去完成时:
The engine had been running poorly because it had become hypercarbureted. = 发动机运转不良是因为它已经变得富碳。
Before the adjustment, the carburetor had been delivering a hypercarbureted mixture. = 在调整之前，化油器一直在输送富碳混合物。

将来时:
If we don't adjust the carburetor, the engine will become hypercarbureted. = 如果我们不调整化油器，发动机将变得富碳。
The increased fuel flow will likely result in a hypercarbureted condition. = 增加的燃油流量可能会导致富碳状态。


虚拟语气:
If the mixture were less hypercarbureted, the engine would run more smoothly. = 如果混合物富碳程度较低，发动机将运转更平稳。
I wish the fuel mixture weren't so hypercarbureted. = 我希望燃油混合物不要这么富碳。

被动语态:
The engine was damaged by the hypercarbureted fuel. = 发动机被富碳燃料损坏。
The carburetor was adjusted to correct the hypercarbureted condition. = 化油器进行了调整以纠正富碳状态。


疑问句:
Is the engine running because it's hypercarbureted? = 发动机运转不良是因为它富碳了吗？
Is the hypercarbureted mixture causing the engine problems? = 富碳混合物是否导致了发动机问题？


否定句:
The fuel mixture is not hypercarbureted; it's lean. = 燃油混合物不是富碳的；它是稀薄的。
The problem is not a hypercarbureted condition; it's a clogged fuel filter. = 问题不是富碳状态；而是燃油过滤器堵塞。


PHRASE->
hypercarbureted fuel mixture 富碳燃料混合物
hypercarbureted engine 富碳发动机
hypercarbureted combustion 富碳燃烧
hypercarbureted condition 富碳状态
hypercarbureted air-fuel ratio 富碳空燃比
