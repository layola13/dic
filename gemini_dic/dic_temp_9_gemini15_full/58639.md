词源:

The word "dumbfounded" is a compound word, combining "dumb" and "founded."

* **Dumb:**  Originally meant "mute," "silent," or "speechless."  This meaning is now largely archaic, except in expressions like "dumbfounded."

* **Founded:**  Here, it's not the usual meaning related to establishing something.  Instead, it's a past participle used figuratively to suggest being struck or rendered speechless, as if hit by a sudden, overwhelming force. The usage is likely influenced by words like "thunderstruck".


用法说明:
