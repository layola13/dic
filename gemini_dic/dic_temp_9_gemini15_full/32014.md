词源:
The word "cheque" comes from the Middle French word "cheque," meaning "a mark, a ticket, a token."  This, in turn, is derived from the Old French word "eschec," which has the same meaning, and ultimately from the Persian word "shakh," meaning "king" (in chess).  The association with a "king" likely comes from the concept of the cheque being a powerful financial instrument. The modern spelling evolved through various stages of French and English influence.
