词源:  The word "saunter" ultimately derives from the Old French word "santer," meaning "to make the sign of the cross."  This seemingly unrelated origin is believed to stem from the practice of pilgrims pausing during their journeys to make the sign of the cross, thereby suggesting a leisurely and contemplative pace.  Over time, the meaning shifted from the religious act to the act of walking in a relaxed manner.
