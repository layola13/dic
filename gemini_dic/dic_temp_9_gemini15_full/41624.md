WORD ORIGIN->

The word "correctabilities" is derived from the adjective "correctable," which in turn comes from the verb "correct" + the suffix "-able" (meaning capable of being). The addition of "-ities" forms a plural noun, indicating multiple instances or aspects of correctability.  The ultimate root is the Latin word "corrigere," meaning "to straighten," "to correct," or "to amend."
