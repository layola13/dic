词源:
The word "pretense" comes from the Old French word "pretense," meaning "intention, purpose," which in turn derives from the Latin word "praetendere," meaning "to stretch forth, to allege, to pretend."  The meaning evolved from a general sense of "claim" or "allegation" to its modern meaning of a false show or appearance.
