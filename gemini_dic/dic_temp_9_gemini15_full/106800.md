labidometer:/ˌlæbɪˈdɒmɪtər/| n. |实验室仪表，实验室计量器|A labidometer is a general term for any instrument used for measurement in a laboratory setting.  The specific function of a labidometer depends on the type of measurement required.  It's a less common and more general term, often used for instruments that don't have a more specific name.  |Example: The researcher calibrated the labidometer before conducting the experiment.  研究人员在进行实验之前校准了实验室仪表。|近义词：laboratory instrument, measuring device |反义词：N/A


USAGE->
This word is not common enough to have typical usages across different tenses.  The usage would depend entirely on the specific type of labidometer being discussed and the experiment being performed.  For example, if it measured temperature, the usage might resemble that of a thermometer:


一般现在时:
The labidometer measures the sample's viscosity. = 该实验室仪表测量样品的粘度。
The labidometer reads 25 degrees Celsius. = 该实验室仪表读数为摄氏25度。


一般过去时:
The labidometer measured the solution's pH. = 该实验室仪表测量了溶液的pH值。
The labidometer registered a peak at 1000 Hz. = 该实验室仪表在1000赫兹处记录到一个峰值。


现在完成时:
The labidometer has consistently produced accurate results. = 该实验室仪表一直产生准确的结果。
The labidometer has recorded several readings today. = 该实验室仪表今天记录了几个读数。


过去完成时:
The labidometer had already recorded the data before the power outage. = 在停电之前，该实验室仪表已经记录了数据。
The labidometer had malfunctioned prior to the experiment. = 在实验之前，该实验室仪表已经出现故障。


将来时:
The labidometer will measure the conductivity of the liquid. = 该实验室仪表将测量液体的电导率。
The labidometer will be calibrated next week. = 该实验室仪表将于下周进行校准。


虚拟语气:
If the labidometer were working correctly, we would have accurate data. = 如果该实验室仪表工作正常，我们将获得准确的数据。
I wish the labidometer had been calibrated before the experiment. = 我希望该实验室仪表在实验前已经过校准。


被动语态:
The sample's weight was measured by the labidometer. = 样品的重量由该实验室仪表测量。
The labidometer is being used to analyze the sample. = 该实验室仪表正用于分析样品。


疑问句:
What does the labidometer measure? = 该实验室仪表测量什么？
Is the labidometer calibrated correctly? = 该实验室仪表是否已正确校准？


否定句:
The labidometer did not record any data. = 该实验室仪表没有记录任何数据。
The labidometer is not functioning properly. = 该实验室仪表运行不正常。


PHRASE->
Because "labidometer" is a general term,  phrases are dependent on its specific function.  No common phrases exist.
