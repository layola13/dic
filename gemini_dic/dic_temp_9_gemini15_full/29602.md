词源:

The word "categorical" originates from the Medieval Latin *categoriālis,  derived from the Greek *κατηγορητικός (katēgorētikos), meaning "affirmative," "predicative," or "declarative." This in turn comes from  *κατηγορεῖν (katēgorein), meaning "to accuse," "to predicate," or "to assert."  The Greek word's use in logic influenced its development into the modern English adjective.  The concept of categories, as developed by Aristotle, further shaped its meaning.
