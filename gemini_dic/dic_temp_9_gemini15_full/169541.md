propeptide:/ˈproʊpeptaɪd/| n. |前肽，前导肽|A propeptide is a polypeptide chain that is removed from a protein precursor to yield a mature protein.  It often plays a role in the protein's folding, stability, or targeting.  For example, many secreted proteins are synthesized with propeptides that prevent premature activation or aggregation before they are secreted. |Example: The propeptide of insulin is cleaved off to form the active hormone.|近义词：precursor, prohormone |反义词：mature protein


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The propeptide directs the protein to its correct location. = 前导肽引导蛋白质到达其正确位置。
This propeptide is cleaved during maturation. = 这种前导肽在成熟过程中被切割。


一般过去时:
Researchers identified a novel propeptide sequence. = 研究人员发现了一个新的前导肽序列。
The propeptide was removed by enzymatic action. = 前导肽通过酶促作用被去除。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the role of propeptides in many proteins. = 科学家们已经研究了前导肽在许多蛋白质中的作用。
The function of this particular propeptide has been elucidated. = 这种特定前导肽的功能已被阐明。


过去完成时:
Before maturation, the protein contained a large propeptide. = 在成熟之前，蛋白质包含一个大的前导肽。
The propeptide had already been cleaved when the sample was analyzed. = 当样本被分析时，前导肽已经被切割了。


将来时:
We will investigate the role of this propeptide in disease. = 我们将研究这种前导肽在疾病中的作用。
Future research will focus on the structure of propeptides. = 未来的研究将集中在前导肽的结构上。


虚拟语气:
If the propeptide were not present, the protein would misfold. = 如果不存在前导肽，蛋白质就会错误折叠。
It is crucial that the propeptide be cleaved at the correct site. = 前导肽必须在正确的位置被切割，这至关重要。


被动语态:
The propeptide is often cleaved by specific proteases. = 前导肽通常被特定的蛋白酶切割。
The protein's activity is regulated by the propeptide. = 蛋白的活性受前导肽的调控。


疑问句:
What is the function of this propeptide? = 这个前导肽的功能是什么？
How is the propeptide removed from the precursor protein? = 前导肽是如何从前体蛋白中去除的？


否定句:
The propeptide is not always necessary for protein folding. = 前导肽并非总是蛋白质折叠所必需的。
This protein does not contain a propeptide. = 这种蛋白质不包含前导肽。


PHRASE->
propeptide processing = 前导肽加工
propeptide cleavage = 前导肽切割
propeptide sequence = 前导肽序列
propeptide region = 前导肽区域
propeptide structure = 前导肽结构
