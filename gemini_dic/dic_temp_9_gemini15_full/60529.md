elaidic: /ɪˈleɪdɪk/ | adj. | 反式油酸的；反式十八碳一烯酸的 | Relating to or denoting elaidic acid, a trans isomer of oleic acid.  Elaidic acid is a saturated fatty acid found in some animal fats and processed foods. It is a trans fatty acid, meaning that the hydrogen atoms are on opposite sides of the double bond in the molecule. | The elaidic acid content of the processed food was surprisingly high.  | 近义词: trans-oleic | 反义词: cis-oleic
