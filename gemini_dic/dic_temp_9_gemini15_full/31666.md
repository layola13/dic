词源:

Derived from the word "chat," meaning to talk in a familiar and informal way. The suffix "-ily" transforms the verb into an adverb, indicating the manner in which something is done.  The ultimate origin traces back to Old French "cacher" meaning "to catch, seize" which developed a sense of "to gossip" or "to chatter."


用法说明:

Chattily is an adverb that describes how someone speaks.  It implies a lively and perhaps somewhat excessive amount of talking, often about unimportant matters.  It can be used to describe both positive and negative situations, depending on the context.  A positive use might emphasize the friendliness and sociability of the speaker; a negative use might highlight the excessive or irritating nature of their talkativeness.
