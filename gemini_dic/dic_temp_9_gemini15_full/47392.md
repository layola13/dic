词源:
The word "deadeningly" is derived from the adjective "deadening," which itself comes from the verb "deaden," meaning to make less sensitive or responsive.  The suffix "-ingly" transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner or way in which something is done.  The root sense relates to the loss of feeling or sensation, both literally and metaphorically (as in the loss of interest or excitement).
