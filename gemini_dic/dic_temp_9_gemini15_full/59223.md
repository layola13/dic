词源:

The word "dystopic" is derived from the word "dystopia," which was coined in the early 20th century. It is the antonym of "utopia," meaning a perfect or ideal place.  "Dystopia" combines the prefix "dys-" (meaning "bad" or "ill") with "topia" (from the Greek word "topos," meaning "place").  Therefore, "dystopia" literally means "bad place." "Dystopic" is simply the adjectival form of "dystopia."


用法说明:

Dystopic is primarily used as an adjective to describe:

* **Literary works:**  Dystopian literature often explores themes of social control, oppression, environmental destruction, and technological overreach.

* **Fictional settings:** Dystopic settings are characterized by bleakness, oppression, and a lack of freedom.

* **Social or political situations:**  The term can be applied metaphorically to describe real-world situations that share characteristics with dystopian fiction.
