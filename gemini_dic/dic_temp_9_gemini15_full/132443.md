The word "nondeporteds" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a neologism,  a newly coined word or expression.  It appears to be an attempt to create a noun meaning "those who have not been deported," but it's grammatically incorrect and not found in dictionaries.

Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide useful information, we can analyze the components:

**"Non-"**

/nɒn/ | prefix | 非，不 |  This prefix means "not" or "opposite of." | Example: non-profit (非营利的)


**"Deport"**

/dɪˈpɔːrt/ | v. | 驱逐出境 | To expel (a foreigner) from a country, typically on the grounds of illegal entry or conduct. | Example: The government deported him for violating immigration laws. (政府以违反移民法为由将他驱逐出境。)


**"-ed"**

/-d/ | suffix | 过去分词后缀 | Forms the past participle of regular verbs.  It can also function as an adjective. | Example:  The deported criminal (被驱逐的罪犯)


To create a grammatically correct and understandable term for "those who have not been deported," one could use:

**"Undeported"** /ˌʌn.dɪˈpɔːrtɪd/ | adj. | 未被驱逐的 |  Not deported. | Example: The undeported refugees remained in the camp. (未被驱逐的难民仍然留在营地。)  This is a better option.


**"Those not deported"** This is a perfectly acceptable and clear phrase.


**"Individuals who have not been deported"** This is a longer but more formal and precise phrase.
