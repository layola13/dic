词源:
The word "compressor" comes from the verb "compress," meaning "to press together" or "to reduce in size."  The suffix "-or" indicates an agent or instrument that performs the action.  Ultimately, it's derived from the Latin word "comprimere," which is a combination of "com-" (together) and "premere" (to press).
