词源：

The word "cavalier" originates from the Old French word "cavalier," meaning "horseman" or "knight."  This in turn derives from the Latin word "caballarius," also meaning "horseman."  The sense of nonchalance developed later, likely stemming from the perceived aloofness and disregard for certain rules associated with the aristocratic class of knights.  The modern usage reflects this shift in connotation.
