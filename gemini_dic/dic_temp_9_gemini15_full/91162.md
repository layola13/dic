hydracid:/ˈhaɪdræsɪd/| n. |氢酸|A hydracid is a binary acid that contains hydrogen and a nonmetal.  Unlike oxoacids, it does not contain oxygen.  These acids are generally strong acids that ionize completely in water to produce hydrogen ions (H+) and an anion of the nonmetal.|Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a common hydracid used in many industrial processes.|近义词：binary acid|反义词：oxoacid
