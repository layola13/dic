词源:
The word "disabused" comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "to remove or deprive of") and the verb "abuse," which in this context means "to deceive or mislead."  Therefore, "disabuse" literally means "to remove the deception or misleading from someone."  The older meaning of "abuse" is relevant here; the word didn't originally have the solely negative connotations it has today.
