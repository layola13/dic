英文解析:
The word "noninhabitable" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "inhabitable."  "Inhabitable" means capable of being lived in, suitable for human habitation. Therefore, "noninhabitable" signifies the opposite: not suitable for living, incapable of supporting human life.  This could be due to various factors such as extreme weather conditions, lack of resources, or dangerous environments.
