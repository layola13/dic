词源:  The word combines "quasi," meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent," from Latin *quasi, and "mechanical," referring to machines or their operation, ultimately deriving from Greek *mêchanikos ("of or relating to machines").  Therefore, "quasi-mechanical" describes something that exhibits characteristics of a machine but is not entirely or perfectly so.
