The word "calendar" ultimately derives from the Latin word "kalendae," which referred to the first day of the month in the Roman calendar.  The Roman calendar was a lunisolar calendar, meaning it was based on both the cycles of the moon and the sun.  Over time, "kalendae" evolved into the Old French "kalendier" and then into the English "calendar."
