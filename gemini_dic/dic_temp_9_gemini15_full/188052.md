词源:
The word "roughshod" originates from the practice of equipping horses with horseshoes that had rough, unworked edges. This resulted in the horses leaving deep marks and causing damage as they traversed a surface.  The term metaphorically extended to describe actions or behavior that are similarly harsh, inconsiderate, and destructive.  The "rough" part refers to the uneven, unrefined surface of the horseshoe, and "shod" means equipped with shoes (horseshoes in this case).
