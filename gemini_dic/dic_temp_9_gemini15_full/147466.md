The word "overon" does not exist as a single, standard English word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis according to your requested format.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you intended a different word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  A newly coined word or term used within a specific community or context.  If this is the case, please provide more context about where you encountered this word.
* **It's a combination of words:**  It might be two words written together, such as "over on".  If this is the case, each word should be analyzed separately.


Please clarify the word or provide more context for a proper analysis.
