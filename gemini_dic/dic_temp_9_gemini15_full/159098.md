词源:  The word "pock-marked" is a compound word.  "Pock" comes from the Middle English word "pok," meaning a pustule or blister, particularly one caused by smallpox. "-marked" is a suffix indicating that something is marked or characterized by pocks.  The connection to smallpox is historical, as the disease left distinctive pitted scars on the skin.
