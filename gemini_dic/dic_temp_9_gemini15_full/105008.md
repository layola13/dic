kenos:/ˈkiːnɒs/| adj.|空的；虚无的；空虚的|Empty; void; lacking substance or content.  The theological term refers to the self-emptying of God in the incarnation of Jesus Christ.|例句：The kenos of God refers to his emptying himself to become human.  上帝的自我虚空指的是他为了成为人而舍弃自己。


The concept of kenosis is primarily used in theology, specifically in Christian theology. It describes the self-emptying of God in the incarnation of Jesus Christ, where God, in becoming human, temporarily relinquished some of his divine attributes.  This is not to say that God ceased to be God, but rather that he chose to limit his own power and glory for the sake of humanity.
