词源:

The term "her-nibs" is a playful alteration of the more formal "his nibs," which was originally a humorous and respectful way of referring to a man of high rank or importance.  The "nibs" part likely derives from the quill pen nibs used for writing, associating the person with the power of writing and authority. The feminine version, "her-nibs," followed naturally.  The term's use evolved over time to become a term of endearment or affectionate teasing, particularly within a marital context.
