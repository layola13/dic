词源:

The word "fortunate" originates from the Old French word "fortuné," which itself derives from the Latin word "fortunatus."  "Fortunatus" is the past participle of "fortunare," meaning "to make fortunate" or "to favor."  The root is "fortuna," meaning "fortune," "luck," or "chance."  Thus, the word's history traces back to the concept of being favored by fate or chance.
