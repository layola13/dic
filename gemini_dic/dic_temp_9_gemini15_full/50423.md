WORD ORIGIN->

Depravedness comes from the adjective "depraved," which in turn originates from the Old French word "depriver," meaning "to deprive."  The sense of moral corruption developed over time, as being "deprived" of virtue led to the concept of being morally corrupt.  The "-ness" suffix is added to create the noun form, indicating the state or quality of being depraved.
