词源:
The word "quasi-constantly" is a combination of "quasi-" and "constantly."

"Quasi-" is a Latin prefix meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation to something, but not a perfect match.

"Constantly" is an adverb derived from the adjective "constant," meaning "occurring continuously."
