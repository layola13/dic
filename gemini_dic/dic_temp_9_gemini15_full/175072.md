radiopticon:/ˌreɪdiəʊˈpɪktɒn/| n. |辐射全景图，辐射监控系统 |A radiopticon is a theoretical concept describing a system of surveillance where individuals are constantly monitored through various technologies, especially those involving radio waves, creating a sense of pervasive observation. Unlike the panopticon, which relies on the visible threat of observation, the radiopticon's power comes from the invisible and pervasive nature of electronic surveillance. This creates a self-regulating society where individuals modify their behavior based on the perceived, if not always real, possibility of being monitored.  |The constant presence of surveillance cameras and data collection through smartphones forms a type of radiopticon in modern society.|近义词：panopticon, surveillance system, electronic monitoring |反义词：privacy, anonymity |名词
