词源:

The word "innumeracies" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not" or "without"), the root word "numeracy" (meaning "the ability to understand and work with numbers"), and the suffix "-ies" (indicating a plural noun).  Therefore, "innumeracies" literally means "the state of being without numeracy" or "multiple instances of lacking numeracy."
