The word "prerevises" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  It's likely a combination of "pre-" (meaning before) and "revise" (to review and correct).  Therefore, a possible meaning could be "to revise beforehand" or "to make preliminary revisions." However, without context or further information, its precise meaning and usage remain unclear.  I cannot provide a full analysis using the requested format because the word lacks established linguistic standing.
