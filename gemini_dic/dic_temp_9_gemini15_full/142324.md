orthodromic:/ɔːrθəˈdrɒmɪk/| adj.| 正球面的；沿大圆航线的 | Relating to or denoting the shortest distance between two points on the surface of a sphere, along a great circle.  This term is often used in navigation and geography to describe the most direct route between two locations on Earth, which follows a great-circle path. | Example: The orthodromic distance between London and New York is significantly shorter than the rhumb line distance.  伦敦和纽约之间的正球面距离比等角航线距离短得多。 |近义词：great-circle, geodesic | 反义词：loxodromic, rhumb-line
