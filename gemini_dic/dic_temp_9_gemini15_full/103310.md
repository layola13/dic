词源:
The word "jig" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "gigge," which referred to a lively dance.  The term's origins trace back to a variety of possible sources, including the Old French word "gigue" (meaning "a lively dance").  The usage of "jig" to describe a mechanical device or movement evolved later, likely reflecting the rapid, rhythmic nature of the action.
