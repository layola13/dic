disconformable:/ˌdɪskənˈfɔːrməbl/| adj.|不整合的；不一致的|Geology:  Referring to a surface of erosion or non-deposition separating two rock strata of different ages, indicating a significant time gap in the geological record.  This means there's a missing part of the rock sequence. |例句：The unconformity represents a disconformable contact between the older Paleozoic rocks and the overlying Mesozoic strata.  不整合面代表了古老的古生界岩石和上覆的中生界地层之间不整合的接触。

The disconformable layers showed evidence of significant erosion before the deposition of the younger rocks. 不整合层显示出在较年轻的岩石沉积之前存在明显的侵蚀迹象。|近义词：unconformable, discordant|反义词：conformable, continuous


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The contact is disconformable. = 这个接触面是不整合的。
This interpretation is disconformable with the data. = 这种解释与数据不符。


一般过去时:
Geologists found the contact disconformable. = 地质学家发现这个接触面是不整合的。
The previous theory proved disconformable with new findings. = 先前的理论被证明与新的发现不符。


现在完成时:
Geologists have found many disconformable contacts. = 地质学家已经发现了许多不整合接触面。
The research has shown that this theory is disconformable with the evidence. = 研究表明该理论与证据不符。


过去完成时:
They had already established that the layers were disconformable. = 他们已经确定这些岩层是不整合的。
Scientists had determined that the previous model was disconformable with reality. = 科学家们已经确定先前的模型与现实不符。


将来时:
Further research will show if the contact is disconformable. = 进一步的研究将显示该接触面是否是不整合的。
The new data will likely prove the previous model disconformable. = 新数据可能会证明之前的模型与事实不符。


虚拟语气:
If the contact were disconformable, we would expect to see erosion features. = 如果接触面是不整合的，我们会期望看到侵蚀特征。
I wish the data were not so disconformable with my hypothesis. = 我希望数据与我的假设不那么不符。


被动语态:
The disconformity was identified by geologists. = 不整合面由地质学家确定。
The theory was found to be disconformable with the experimental results. = 该理论被发现与实验结果不符。


疑问句:
Is the contact disconformable? = 这个接触面是不整合的吗？
Are the results disconformable with the predictions? = 结果与预测不符吗？


否定句:
The contact is not disconformable; it's conformable. = 该接触面不是不整合的；它是整合的。
The new data are not disconformable with the existing theory. = 新数据与现有理论并不矛盾。


PHRASE->
