ETYMOLOGY->
The word "overweening" comes from the Old English "oferwenan," which means "to overpower" or "to overcome."  The prefix "over-" indicates excess, while "ween" is an archaic word meaning "to think" or "to believe."  Therefore, "overweening" originally meant "thinking oneself too highly" or "excessively believing in oneself." The modern sense of arrogance developed from this original meaning.
