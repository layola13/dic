/ˌhaɪpərkæˈslæsɪkælətiz/ | n. | 超古典性；极度古典主义 |  The term "hyperclassicalities" is not a standard English word found in common dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism, likely created by combining "hyper-" (meaning "excessive" or "beyond") with "classicalities" (a plural form suggesting multiple aspects of classicism).  Therefore, a precise definition and usage examples require context from where this word originated.  It likely refers to an extreme or exaggerated form of classical style or principles in art, literature, music, or other fields.  Its meaning would depend entirely on the context of its use. |  (No example sentences can be provided without knowing the intended context.) |  (Near synonyms depend on the context, possibilities include:  extreme classicism, ultra-classicism, exaggerated classicism) | (Antonyms depend on the context, possibilities include: modernism, avant-garde, postmodernism) | n.
