The word "nafas" is not an English word.  It's an Arabic word.  Therefore, I cannot provide an English word analysis following the requested format.  To analyze "nafas," we need to use Arabic linguistic tools.

However, I can give you information about the word "nafas" in Arabic:


/næfæs/ | n. | breath, soul, life |  نَفَس (nafas) in Arabic refers to breath, but it also carries metaphorical meanings related to the soul, spirit, or even life itself.  It can describe a single breath or the act of breathing.  It is also used figuratively to express things like "a moment" or "a respite." |


例句 (Examples in Arabic with English translation):


*  أخذ نفسًا عميقًا.  (ʔaxada nafasan ʕamiːqan.) - He took a deep breath.
*  نفسهُ في خطر. (nafsuhu fī ḵaṭar) - His life is in danger (literally, his breath is in danger).
*  احتاج إلى بعض النَفَس. (iḥtāja ʔilā baʕḍi n-nafas) - I need some respite/a break (literally, I need some breath).


近義詞 (Synonyms in Arabic, approximate meanings):

* تَنَفُّس (tanāffus) - respiration, breathing
* روح (rūḥ) - spirit, soul (more spiritual connotation)


反義詞 (Antonyms in Arabic, difficult to directly translate as it depends on the context):

There aren't direct antonyms.  The opposite meaning would depend on the context. For example, if "nafas" means "breath," the opposite might be related to suffocation or lack of air. If it means "life," the opposite would be "death."


Because "nafas" is not an English word,  sections like "USAGE," with English tense examples,  and "PHRASE," with English phrasal verbs, are not applicable.  Arabic grammar and sentence structure are significantly different from English.
