semicompact: /ˌsɛmiˈkɑːmpækt/ | adj. | 半紧致的，半紧凑的 |  Relating to a topological space that is not compact but satisfies a weaker condition related to compactness.  Specifically, a space is semicompact if every open cover has a countable subcover.  This is a weaker condition than compactness because a compact space has a *finite* subcover. |  The space X is semicompact, but not compact.  = 空间X是半紧致的，但不是紧致的。| 近义词: (No direct perfect synonym, as it describes a specific topological property) | 反义词: compact (in the context of topological spaces) |
