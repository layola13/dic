词源:  The word "Congregationalist" is derived from "Congregationalism," which itself comes from "congregation" + "-ism."  "Congregation" originates from the Latin word "congregatio," meaning "a gathering together" or "assembly." The suffix "-ism" denotes a system, doctrine, or practice.  Therefore, Congregationalist refers to someone who adheres to the principles and practices of Congregationalism, a Protestant Christian tradition emphasizing local church autonomy.
