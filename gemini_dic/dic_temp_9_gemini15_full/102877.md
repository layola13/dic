词源:  The word "jaunty" ultimately derives from the Middle Dutch word *janter, meaning "a swaggering gait."  This term then evolved into the Middle English word *janty, before its current form emerged.  The association with a lively and confident manner likely developed from the visual impression of a confident, brisk walk.
