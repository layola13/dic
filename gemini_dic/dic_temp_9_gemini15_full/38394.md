词源:

The word "conceptuality" is derived from the noun "concept" and the suffix "-ality," which denotes a quality or state.  "Concept" itself comes from the Latin word "conceptus," a past participle of "concipere," meaning "to conceive" or "to understand." Therefore, "conceptuality" ultimately traces its roots back to the idea of understanding or forming ideas in the mind.
