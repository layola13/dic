词源:  The phrase likely originated from the literal act of whispering a secret into someone's ear.  The "bug" metaphor might have evolved from the idea of a small, persistent irritant that gradually influences someone's thoughts or actions.  The precise origin is difficult to pinpoint but the imagery suggests a clandestine and subtly persuasive communication.
