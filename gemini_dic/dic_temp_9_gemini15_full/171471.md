词源:

The word "puffinry" is derived from "puffin," a type of seabird known for its puffing up its chest.  This puffed-up appearance is metaphorically associated with self-importance and pretentious display, thus leading to the development of "puffinry" to describe such behavior.  The "-ry" suffix denotes an activity, practice, or state.
