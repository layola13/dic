This request is impossible to fulfill.  The provided format is for analyzing a *single word*, but "{mbb}" is not a single, established English word.  It's possible:

* **It's an abbreviation or acronym:**  Without context, it's impossible to determine what "{mbb}" stands for.  It could represent numerous things depending on the field (e.g., medical, technical, etc.).
* **It's a misspelling:**  There's no known word in English that's spelled "{mbb}".
* **It's a made-up word:**  The user might have invented it.


To get a response, please provide the correct spelling of the word you want analyzed, or the context in which "{mbb}" appears.  Then, I can provide the analysis according to the requested format.
