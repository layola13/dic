excitedness's: /ɪkˈsaɪtɪdnəsɪz/ | n. |兴奋的（所有格） |  The word "excitedness's" is a grammatically unusual and rarely used form. It represents the possessive form of "excitedness," indicating belonging or possession.  It's essentially the possessive case of a noun already expressing a state or feeling.  Better alternatives almost always exist. | The children's excitedness's contagious energy filled the room. (This sentence is grammatically correct but awkward.  A better phrasing would be: "The children's excited energy filled the room.") | excitement, enthusiasm, fervor | calmness, apathy, indifference | noun


USAGE->
This word is so rarely used that providing examples for various tenses is unnecessary and would be artificial.  The possessive form should be avoided in most contexts.  Instead, use alternative phrasing.

For example, instead of: "The dog's excitedness's level was high."

Use: "The dog was very excited." or "The dog's excitement was high."


PHRASE->
