factorabilities:/ˌfæktərəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. |可分解性；可因式分解性 |The ability to be factored or decomposed into simpler components.  This term is primarily used in mathematics and computer science, referring to the ease or difficulty with which a number, polynomial, or matrix can be broken down into factors.  For example, in number theory, the factorability of a large number is crucial in cryptography. In linear algebra, the factorability of a matrix can influence the efficiency of certain algorithms. | Example: The high factorability of the number made it vulnerable to cryptographic attacks.  The factorability of the matrix significantly impacted the runtime of the algorithm. | 近义词: decomposability, divisibility | 反义词:  indivisibility, prime
