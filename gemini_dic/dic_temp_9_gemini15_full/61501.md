词源:
The word "embroil" comes from the Old French word "embrouiller," meaning "to confuse, mix up, or entangle."  The prefix "em-" is an intensifying prefix, and "-broil" is related to the word "broil," meaning "to cook over a fire," suggesting a state of intense heat and agitation.  The evolution of the word reflects a shift in meaning from a physical act of mixing to a metaphorical entanglement in a complicated situation.
