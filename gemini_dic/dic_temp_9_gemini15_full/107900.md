The word "laroid" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or related word?

2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a brand name, a place name, or a person's name.  More context is needed.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, jargon within a specific field, or slang used in a limited community.  Again, context is crucial.

4. **It's a made-up word:**  The word might be entirely fictional, created for a specific purpose (e.g., in a book, game, or other creative work).
