词源:

The word "highfalutin" is of American origin, emerging in the 19th century.  Its etymology is uncertain, but it's likely a blend of "highfaluting" (itself possibly from "high-falutin," suggesting something "high-flying" or inflated), with "falutin" possibly being a playful alteration or corruption of words like "falsetto" (a high-pitched voice) or a related term implying pretense or affectation.  The exact origins remain debated among etymologists.
