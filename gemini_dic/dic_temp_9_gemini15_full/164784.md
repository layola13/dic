词源:

The word "prefertilized" is a combination of "pre-" (meaning "before") and "fertilized" (the past participle of "fertilize," meaning "to make fertile; to impregnate"). "Fertilize" itself comes from the Late Latin word *fertilis* meaning "fertile" and the suffix *-ize*, which creates verbs.


USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective and therefore doesn't have verb conjugations in the way that "to be" or "to do" would.  It describes a state of being.  Therefore, tense considerations are applied to the verb describing the *action* related to the prefertilized entity.


一般现在时:
The egg is prefertilized. = 卵子是预先受精的。
Scientists prefertilize eggs in the lab. = 科学家在实验室里预先使卵子受精。


一般过去时:
The egg was prefertilized yesterday. = 卵子昨天是预先受精的。
The researchers prefertilized the embryos before implantation. = 研究人员在植入前预先使胚胎受精。


现在完成时:
The eggs have been prefertilized. = 卵子已经被预先受精了。
The team has prefertilized many eggs for this study. = 团队为这项研究预先使许多卵子受精了。


过去完成时:
The eggs had been prefertilized before the experiment began. = 在实验开始之前，卵子已经被预先受精了。
The scientists had prefertilized the samples prior to analysis. = 科学家在分析之前已经预先使样本受精了。


将来时:
The eggs will be prefertilized tomorrow. = 卵子明天将被预先受精。
The laboratory will prefertilize the gametes for the next procedure. = 实验室将为下一个程序预先使配子受精。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "prefertilized".  The word is highly specific to scientific and medical contexts.
