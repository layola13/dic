The word "geoc" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
2. **It's a technical term or abbreviation:** It might be specific to a certain field (e.g., geology, geography, or a specialized software program). If you can provide context, it might be possible to identify its meaning.
3. **It's a newly coined word or slang:**  Newly created words don't have established dictionary entries.

Please provide more information or context so I can assist you better.
