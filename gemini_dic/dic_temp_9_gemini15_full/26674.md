词源:
The word "cad" is believed to be a shortened form of "cadet," originally referring to a military student. Over time, the term acquired negative connotations, associating it with arrogance and bad behavior, particularly toward women.  The shift in meaning likely reflects a social perception of certain types of privileged young men.
