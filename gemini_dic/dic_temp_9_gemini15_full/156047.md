USAGE->
This word is primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly in microbiology and ecology, and does not have common usage in everyday language.  Therefore, typical tense conjugations like those demonstrated for "what" are not applicable.  The word itself is a noun and therefore doesn't conjugate like a verb.


PHRASE->
Phrases involving "photoorganotroph" would be highly specialized within the field of microbiology and would usually involve descriptive terms relating to specific species or ecosystems.  For example:

"purple non-sulfur photoorganotroph"
"marine photoorganotroph community"
"photoorganotroph growth conditions"
"photoorganotroph metabolism"
"photoorganotroph diversity"
