mixed-race: /ˈmɪkst reɪs/ | adj. |混血的，多种族的 | 指拥有两种或多种不同种族血统的人。 This term describes individuals whose ancestry includes people from different racial groups.  The term can be used to describe individuals, families, or communities.  It's important to note that the definition and understanding of race itself are complex and socially constructed. |例句：She is a mixed-race actress of African-American and Asian descent. 她是一位拥有非裔美国人和亚洲血统的混血女演员。

The term "mixed-race" is increasingly considered outdated and potentially problematic by some, as it can imply a hierarchy of races and may not fully capture the complexity of individual identities.  Many people prefer terms like "multiracial" or simply stating their specific ethnic backgrounds.
