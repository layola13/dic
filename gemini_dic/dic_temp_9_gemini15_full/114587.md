词源:
The word "malcontented" is derived from the prefix "mal-" (meaning "bad" or "ill") and the word "contented," which itself comes from the Old French word "content," meaning "satisfied" or "pleased."  Therefore, "malcontented" literally means "badly contented" or "ill-contented," signifying a state of dissatisfaction.
