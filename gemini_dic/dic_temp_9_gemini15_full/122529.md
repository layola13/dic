词源:
The word "modality" comes from the Latin word "modalitas," meaning "manner, mode, or way."  It ultimately derives from the Latin word "modus," meaning "measure, manner, or mode."  The suffix "-ity" indicates a state or quality.  Thus, "modality" signifies the quality or state of having a particular manner or mode of being or acting.
