词源：The word "non-transparency" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "transparency," which comes from the Latin word "transparens," meaning "shining through."  "Transparens" is composed of "trans-" (through) and "parere" (to appear).  Therefore, "non-transparency" literally means "not shining through" or "not easily seen through."
