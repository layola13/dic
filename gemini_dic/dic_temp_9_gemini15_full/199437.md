simulation:/ˌsɪmjuˈleɪʃən/ | n. | 模拟，仿真 | The act of imitating the behavior of some system, often through computer modelling.  It can involve creating a model of a real-world process or system, or it can be used to test and analyze the behavior of a hypothetical system. | Example: The engineers ran a simulation to test the safety of the new bridge. 工程师们进行了一次模拟测试，以检验新桥的安全性能。

The flight simulator provided a realistic simulation of takeoff and landing.  飞行模拟器提供了逼真的起飞和着陆模拟。|近义词：imitation, model, representation | 反义词：reality, actuality |名词

词源:
The word "simulation" comes from the Latin word "simulatio," which means "a feigning, imitation, or pretense."  The Latin word is derived from "simulare," meaning "to make like, imitate, or copy."
