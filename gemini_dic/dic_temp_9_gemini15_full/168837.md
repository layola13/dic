词源:
The word "proempire" is a modern coinage, a blend of "pro-" (meaning "in favor of" or "supporting") and "empire".  The prefix "pro-" derives from Latin, and "empire" traces back to Old French "empire" and ultimately to the Latin "imperium" (command, power, rule).  Therefore, the word's meaning is a direct combination of its constituent parts, reflecting a modern perspective on historical and political concepts.
