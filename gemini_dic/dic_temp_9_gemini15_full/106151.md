PHRASE->
There is no common phrase specifically using "knobbler".  The word itself is relatively uncommon.


词源:
The word "knobbler" likely derives from "knob," meaning a rounded lump or projection. The suffix "-er" is a common agentive suffix, indicating a person who does something or has a certain quality.  Therefore, "knobbler" originally described something with knobs, but evolved to describe a person with a rough, knotty character, similar to the appearance of wood with many knobs.
