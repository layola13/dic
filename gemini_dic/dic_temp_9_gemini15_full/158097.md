plasticization:/ˌplæstɪsəˈzeɪʃən/ | n. |增塑作用，增塑；塑化 |The process of softening a material, typically a polymer, by incorporating a plasticizer. This increases flexibility, workability, and ductility.  |Example:  The plasticization of PVC allows it to be molded into various shapes. 增塑PVC使其可以模塑成各种形状。

The plasticization of the polymer improved its flexibility and reduced its brittleness. 聚合物的增塑作用提高了其柔韧性并降低了其脆性。


近义词：softening,flexibilizing | 反义词：hardening, stiffening

词源:  From "plasticizer" + "-ization,"  the suffix indicating a process or action. "Plasticizer" itself derives from "plastic" (meaning capable of being molded) + "-izer," a suffix denoting an agent that causes a certain action.  The ultimate root lies in the Greek word "plastikos," meaning "fit for molding."
