词源:

The word "immediately" comes from the Middle English word "immediatli," which itself derives from the Old French "immediatement."  The ultimate origin lies in the Latin "immediatus," a combination of the prefix "in-" (not) and "mediatus" (mediated, intermediate). Therefore, "immediately" literally means "without an intermediary" or "without delay."
