platometer:/plætˈɒmɪtər/| n. |面积测量仪；面积计|A platometer is an instrument used to measure the area of an irregular shape, typically by tracing its outline.  It often works mechanically, using a wheel or other mechanism to track the perimeter and calculate the enclosed area.|The surveyor used a platometer to determine the acreage of the oddly shaped field.|近义词：planimeter|反义词：N/A
