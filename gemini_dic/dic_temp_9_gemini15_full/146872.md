词源:
The word "overinfluence" is a compound word. It combines the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much," "excessive") with the noun "influence" (meaning "the capacity to have an effect on the character, development, or behavior of someone or something").  Therefore, its meaning is directly derived from the combination of these two elements.
