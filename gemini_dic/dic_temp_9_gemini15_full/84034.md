词源：

The word is a compound of "half" and "false".  "Half" means one of two equal parts, and "false" means not true or accurate.  The combination signifies something that is only partially true.


用法说明：

Half-false is primarily used as an adjective to describe statements, information, or accounts that are a mixture of truth and falsehood. It implies an intentional or unintentional deception, or at least a lack of complete accuracy.  It suggests that while some elements are truthful, other significant parts are fabricated or misleading.  It does not imply an equal balance of truth and falsehood, only that both elements are present.


由于half-false本身是一个形容词，它不具备动词或名词的词性，因此无需列出时态、语态、语气、疑问句或否定句的例句。  它主要用于修饰名词，例如：a half-false story (一个半真半假的故事), half-false information (半真半假的信息).


词组：

由于 "half-false" 本身是一个相对独立的形容词短语，没有常见的固定词组搭配。
