词源:
The name "Germany" comes from the Latin Germania, which was used by the Romans to refer to the Germanic tribes living east of the Rhine River.  The Germanic tribes themselves had various names for their regions and groups.  The modern German name for the country, Deutschland, is derived from "deutsch," meaning "of the people," ultimately having roots in the Proto-Germanic word *þeudō, meaning "people."
