词源:
Derived from "franchise," ultimately from Old French *franchise, meaning "freedom, liberty,"  which in turn has roots in the late Latin *franca ("free").  The modern meaning of "franchise" related to business evolved from the earlier meaning of granting a privilege or liberty to operate a business under a specific brand.
