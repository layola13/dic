词源:  The word "relentment" is derived from the verb "relent," meaning "to become less harsh or severe; to soften."  The suffix "-ment" indicates a state or condition.  Therefore, "relentment" originally signified a softening or lessening of harsh feelings, but its modern usage primarily focuses on the lingering negative emotion after a failure to soften.  It's a semantic shift from a potential softening to a sustained negative feeling.
