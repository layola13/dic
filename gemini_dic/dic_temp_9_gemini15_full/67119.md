词源:
The word "exponential" derives from the word "exponent," which comes from the Latin word "exponere," meaning "to set forth" or "to explain."  In mathematics, an exponent indicates the power to which a number is raised.  The term "exponential" thus describes a relationship where the rate of change is a power of the independent variable, leading to rapid growth or decay.
