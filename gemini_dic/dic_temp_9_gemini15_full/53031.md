diodes:/ˈdaɪoʊdz/ | n. |二极管 |A diode is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts current primarily in one direction; it acts as a one-way valve for electric current.  |Example: The circuit uses a diode to prevent current from flowing in the reverse direction.  这个电路使用二极管来防止电流反向流动。|近义词：rectifier (in some contexts)|反义词：None (no direct opposite, but the behavior can be contrasted with a resistor or conductor)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
This diode rectifies the AC signal. = 这个二极管整流交流信号。
The diodes conduct current in one direction. = 二极管单向导电。


一般过去时:
The diode failed under high voltage. = 二极管在高电压下失效了。
We tested the diodes yesterday. = 我们昨天测试了二极管。


现在完成时:
The engineer has replaced all faulty diodes. = 工程师已经更换了所有故障的二极管。
They have installed new diodes in the power supply. = 他们已经安装了新的电源二极管。


过去完成时:
The system had malfunctioned because a diode had burned out. = 系统出现故障是因为一个二极管烧坏了。
Before the repair, the technician had checked all the diodes. = 维修前，技师检查了所有二极管。


将来时:
We will install more diodes to improve efficiency. = 我们将安装更多二极管以提高效率。
The technician will replace the damaged diode tomorrow. = 技师明天将更换损坏的二极管。


虚拟语气:
If this diode were working, the circuit would function correctly. = 如果这个二极管工作正常，电路就能正常工作。
I wish I had tested the diodes before installation. = 我希望在安装前测试过二极管。


被动语态:
The diodes are used in many electronic devices. = 二极管被广泛应用于许多电子设备中。
The faulty diode was replaced by the technician. = 故障的二极管被技师更换了。


疑问句:
Is this diode a germanium or silicon type? = 这个二极管是锗的还是硅的？
What type of diodes are used in this circuit? = 这个电路中使用了哪种类型的二极管？


否定句:
This diode does not conduct current in the reverse direction. = 这个二极管不会反向导电。
The circuit did not function because a diode was damaged. = 电路没有工作是因为一个二极管损坏。


PHRASE->
light-emitting diode (LED) = 发光二极管
Zener diode = 齐纳二极管
tunnel diode = 隧道二极管
Schottky diode = 肖特基二极管
diode bridge = 二极管桥


词源:
The word "diode" comes from the Greek words "di-" (meaning "two") and "-ode" (meaning "path" or "way").  This refers to its ability to allow current to flow in only two directions (one preferred direction and a reverse direction with high resistance).
