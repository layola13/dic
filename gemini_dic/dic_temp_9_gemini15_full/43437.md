The possessive form of "craps" is "craps'".  It would be used to show possession, for example:

*  "The craps' rules are complex." (The rules of the game of craps are complex.)  Note that this usage is uncommon and might sound awkward; it's generally better to rephrase.  For example, "The rules of craps are complex" or "Craps has complex rules." is preferable.


**Etymology:**

The word "craps" comes from the game of craps, which is believed to have originated in the 18th century. The exact etymology is uncertain, but it likely derives from a combination of earlier terms related to dice games and possibly terms for dishonesty or trickery.
