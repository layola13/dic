词源:
The word "premonstrant" comes from the Latin "praemonstrare," meaning "to show beforehand" or "to foretell."  It refers to the Premonstratensian order of canons regular, a Catholic religious order founded in Prémontré, France, in 1120.  The order emphasized a life of prayer and work, and their name reflects their commitment to proclaiming the Gospel.  The adjectival use of the word extends this meaning to encompass any instance of foreshadowing or foretelling.
