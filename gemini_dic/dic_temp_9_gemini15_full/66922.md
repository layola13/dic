词源:

The word "expendable" comes from the verb "expend," meaning "to use up" or "to spend."  The suffix "-able" means "capable of being." Therefore, "expendable" literally means "capable of being used up" or "capable of being spent."  The word's usage has evolved to include the connotation of being easily sacrificed or replaced.
