The word "jetteau" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:** Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **A word from another language:**  It might be a word from French, or another language, that hasn't been adopted into English. If you can provide the context where you encountered this word, it might be possible to determine its origin and meaning.

3. **A neologism or technical term:** It could be a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field (e.g., a technical term in engineering, architecture, or a specific dialect).
