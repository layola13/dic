nonsubconsciousness: /ˌnɒnsʌbˈkɒnʃəsnəs/ | n. |非潜意识的；意识的 | The state or quality of being not subconscious; awareness.  This word is extremely rare and not found in standard dictionaries. It's likely a newly coined or very rarely used word formed by combining "non-" (not) and "subconsciousness" (the part of the mind that is not fully aware). Therefore, a detailed explanation of usage, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical examples is not possible due to the lack of established linguistic data.  It's best understood by its constituent parts.


英文解析:  The word implies a state of being conscious or aware, the opposite of subconscious.  It suggests a mental state where thoughts and processes are readily accessible to the conscious mind.

例句: (Since the word is not standard, example sentences will be illustrative of the intended meaning rather than actual usage):
