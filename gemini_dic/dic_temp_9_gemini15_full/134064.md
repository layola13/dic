词源:

* **non-:**  A prefix meaning "not."
* **ignominious:**  Derived from Latin "ignominia" meaning "disgrace, dishonor."  This in turn comes from "in-" (not) + "nomen" (name) + "-osus" (full of).  Essentially, it means "without a good name," or "dishonorable."

英文解析:

The word "nonignominious" directly contradicts the meaning of "ignominious."  It describes something that is free from shame, disgrace, or dishonor; it implies honor and respectability.  It's often used to describe an event or action that might have been expected to be shameful but instead turned out to be positive or at least not dishonorable.
