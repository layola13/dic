词源:
The word "gesture" comes from the Old French word "gest," which meant "deed," "action," or "story."  This word, in turn, originates from the Latin word "gestus," which also meant "deed," "action," or "carriage."  The shift in meaning from a general "action" to a specific "movement of the body" happened over time.
