词源:
The word "overestimating" comes from the verb "estimate" (from Old French *estimer, from Latin aestimare "to estimate, value, consider," from ad- "to" + aestimare "to value"). The prefix "over-" indicates "too much" or "excessively."  Therefore, "overestimating" literally means "estimating excessively."
