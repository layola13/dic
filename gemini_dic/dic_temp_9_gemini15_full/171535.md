The word "puler" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* It's a technical term from a specific field.  If so, please provide context.
* It's a neologism (newly coined word) or slang.  If so, please provide the source where you encountered it.

Please provide more information so I can assist you.
