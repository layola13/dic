词源:
The word "skewbald" comes from the Old English "sceoh" (meaning "shaggy" or "slovenly") and "bald" (meaning "white").  The combination suggests a horse with irregular, patchy white markings, hence the term's association with horses.  The prefix "skew" implies irregularity or asymmetry in the pattern.
