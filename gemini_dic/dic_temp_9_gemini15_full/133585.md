nonflatulency: /ˌnɒnˈflætʃʊlənsi/ | n. | 非放屁；不放屁 | The absence of flatulence; not passing gas.  This word is extremely rare and largely considered a neologism (newly coined word).  There is no established usage in standard dictionaries or corpora. Its meaning is entirely derived from its constituent parts: "non-" (not) + "flatulency" (the act of passing gas). |  例句：The doctor noted the patient's unusual nonflatulency as a potential symptom. (医生注意到病人异常的不放屁可能是某种症状。)  There are no recorded instances of this word being used in a sentence, making example sentences purely hypothetical based on its literal meaning. | 近义词:  There are no direct synonyms, as this is a very specific and uncommon term.  One could use descriptive phrases like "absence of flatulence," "lack of gas," or "infrequent flatus." | 反义词: flatulence,  gassiness |  词性: noun
