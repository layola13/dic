quasi-constant: /ˈkwɑːzaɪ ˈkɒnstənt/ | adj. | 准恒定的，近乎恒定的 | Almost constant; nearly constant; showing little variation.  It describes something that remains relatively stable or unchanging over a period of time, but not perfectly so. There might be minor fluctuations or variations, but the overall trend remains consistent. |

例句：

The temperature remained quasi-constant throughout the experiment.  实验过程中温度保持近乎恒定。

The system's performance was quasi-constant over several months. 系统的性能在几个月内保持了近乎恒定。


近义词：nearly constant, approximately constant, relatively constant, fairly constant

反义词：variable, fluctuating, inconsistent, volatile


词源:

* **quasi-**:  from Latin *quasi* meaning "as if," "as it were," "almost," or "seemingly."

* **constant**: from Latin *constans*, present participle of *constare*, meaning "to stand together," "to consist," or "to be firm."  This reflects the idea of something remaining stable and unchanging.
