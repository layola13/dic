WORD ORIGIN->
The word "disrelish" comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the noun "relish," which originally meant "a taste" or "a liking."  Therefore, "disrelish" literally means "a lack of relish" or "a dislike." The word's history traces back to the Old French word "relescher," related to the Latin "re-," meaning "again," and "licium," which referred to a "pleasant taste" or "charm."
