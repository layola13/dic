词源:

The word "disloyal" is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "loyal".  "Loyal" itself originates from Old French "leial" and ultimately from Latin "legalis" (legal, lawful), referring to the adherence to one's obligations and duties.  The evolution reflects a shift in meaning from adhering to law to adhering to a commitment or allegiance.
