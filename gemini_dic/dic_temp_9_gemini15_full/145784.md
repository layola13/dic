词源:

The word "overdazzling" is formed by adding the prefix "over-" to the adjective "dazzling."  "Over-" indicates an excessive or extreme degree. "Dazzling" comes from the Middle English word "dazzlen," meaning "to blind with light," ultimately from Old Norse "daska," meaning "to dash, strike, splash."  Therefore, "overdazzling" signifies a degree of brilliance that is excessive to the point of being overwhelming.
