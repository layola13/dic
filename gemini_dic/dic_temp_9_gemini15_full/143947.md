词源:
The word "outquaffing" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent than") and the verb "quaff" (meaning "to drink deeply").  Therefore, it literally means "to drink more deeply than."  "Quaff" itself has origins in Middle English, related to Old French and ultimately possibly Germanic roots associated with drinking.
