resublimation: /ˌriːˌsʌblɪˈmeɪʃən/ | n. | 再升华；再凝华 | The transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gaseous state, and then back to the solid state, without passing through the liquid state.  This process is often observed with substances that have a high vapor pressure at low temperatures. | Example: The resublimation of iodine crystals is a common example of this phase transition.  碘晶体的再升华是这种相变的常见例子。 | 近义词：deposition (in the context of a solid forming directly from a gas) | 反义词：melting, boiling |  词性: 名词
