The word "microc" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling or provide more context where you encountered this word?

2. **It's a neologism or technical term:** It could be a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field (like science, technology, or a specialized jargon).  If you can provide the context, it might be possible to determine its meaning.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be an abbreviation or a shortened form of a proper noun (a name of a person, place, or organization).

Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  Please provide context or clarify the spelling.
