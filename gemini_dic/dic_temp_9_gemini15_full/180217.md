refractable: /rɪˈfræktəbl/ | adj. | 可折射的，易折射的 | Capable of being refracted; easily refracted.  The term refers to a substance's ability to bend or change the direction of light passing through it.  This bending occurs due to the change in the speed of light as it moves from one medium to another. |  Glass is a highly refractable material.  = 玻璃是一种高度易折射的材料。

The diamond's high refractive index makes it sparkle. = 钻石的高折射率使其闪闪发光。| 近义词：refractive | 反义词：non-refractable


USAGE->

一般现在时:

We will refract the light using a new method. = 我们将使用一种新方法来折射光线。


虚拟语气:
If the lens were more powerful, it would refract the light more effectively. = 如果透镜更强大，它将更有效地折射光线。
If the light had been refracted differently, the image would have been clearer. = 如果光线被以不同的方式折射，图像就会更清晰。


被动语态:
Light is refracted by the lens. = 光线被透镜折射。
The beam was refracted by the prism. = 光束被棱镜折射。


疑问句:
Does this substance refract light? = 这种物质会折射光吗？
How is light refracted in this medium? = 光在这种介质中是如何折射的？


否定句:
This material does not refract light significantly. = 这种材料不会显著地折射光线。
