/ˌnɒnˌrɛfərˈmeɪʃənz/ | n. | 非改革；未经改革的事物 |  The lack of nonreformations in the company's policies led to stagnation.  公司政策缺乏改革导致了停滞。 |  近义词: lack of reform, stagnation | 反义词: reformation, reform, improvement |  The word "nonreformations" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism,  meaning a newly coined word or expression. It is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "reformations," implying the absence of reforms or changes.  Because it's not a standard word, there's no extensive usage data or established grammatical patterns associated with it.  The example sentence illustrates its potential usage, highlighting the lack of positive changes.  It is more appropriate to use alternative phrases like "lack of reform," "absence of changes," or "stagnation" in most contexts.
