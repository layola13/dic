词源:

The word "nosiest" is the superlative form of the adjective "nosy," which ultimately derives from the noun "nose."  The "-iest" suffix indicates the highest degree of the quality.  The connection is that nosy people are perceived as sticking their "nose" into other people's affairs, figuratively speaking.  The evolution reflects a shift from a literal meaning related to the nose to a figurative meaning related to intrusive behavior.


用法说明:

nosiest is only used as an adjective and is the superlative form of nosy,  meaning it describes the highest degree of the characteristic of being nosy. It's typically used to describe people, but can also be used, less commonly, to describe things (e.g., a nosiest machine, implying the loudest or most annoying).  It is used in the same grammatical contexts as other superlative adjectives.

There is no usage section like the example you provided.  The example provided is a template for a word, not a grammatical concept.  The grammatical explanations provided would be appropriate for a word like "what," which is used in various grammatical constructions, but not for "nosiest," which is a simple adjective.
