词源:
The word "disserviced" is a relatively modern coinage, formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") to the verb "serviced."  The root "serviced" comes from the Old French "servir" (to serve), ultimately deriving from the Latin "servire" (to serve). Therefore, "disserviced" literally means "not served" or "badly served," implying a failure to provide adequate service.
