lionlier:/ˈlaɪənliər/| adj.| 狮子的；像狮子的；勇敢的 |  This word is not a standard English word. It seems to be a neologism, a newly coined word, possibly formed by combining "lion" and a suffix meant to suggest a quality associated with lions.  There's no established definition or usage.  It might be used informally to describe something related to lions, or to evoke qualities associated with lions (strength, courage, etc.). However, its meaning would heavily depend on context and the author's intention.  |Example:  (Hypothetical)  "He had a lionlier roar than any other contestant in the competition."  (This implies a roar like a lion's, suggesting power and volume.) |近义词: (depending on intended meaning) leonine, courageous, powerful |反义词: (depending on intended meaning) cowardly, weak, timid |词性: adjective
