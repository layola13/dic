limacon:/ˈlɪməkɒn/| n. |利马çon曲线，蜗牛线|A limaçon is a mathematical curve defined by a polar equation of the form r = b + a cos θ or r = b + a sin θ, where a and b are constants.  The shape of the limaçon varies depending on the ratio of a and b.  When a = b, the curve is a cardioid; when a < b, it is a convex limaçon; and when a > b, it is a limaçon with an inner loop.  The name "limaçon" comes from the French word for "snail."| The architect designed a building with a fascinating limaçon-shaped window. 建筑师设计了一栋带有迷人蜗牛线形状窗户的建筑。 The graph showed a classic example of a limaçon curve.  图表显示了一个典型的蜗牛线曲线示例。|cardioid, spiral| (无明确反义词，其形状取决于参数变化)|名词
