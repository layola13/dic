词源:

The term "jingoism" originates from a 19th-century British patriotic song, "The Jingo," which celebrated aggressive patriotism and a willingness to engage in war.  The exact origin of the word "Jingo" itself is uncertain, but it's believed to be a slang term possibly derived from a variation of "jingling," referring to a kind of boastful or showy patriotism.  Over time, the term "jingoism" became associated with extreme nationalism and aggressive foreign policy.
