词源:

The word "jet" as a noun referring to a type of aircraft originates in the mid-20th century, stemming from the use of jet engines for propulsion.  The word "jet" itself has a much older history, deriving from Old French *jeter (to throw, cast) and ultimately from the Latin *iactare (to throw).  This older meaning is reflected in the verb forms of "jet," meaning "to throw out or spurt."  The deep black color meaning also comes from this older sense, likely referring to the intensely black color of a very dark, shiny substance.
