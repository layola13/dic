prevalidities: /ˌpriːvæˈlɪdətiz/ | n. | 预先有效性；预先有效性指标 |  The term "prevalidities" refers to the extent to which a measure predicts a criterion before the criterion is actually measured.  It's a concept primarily used in research and assessment contexts, particularly where longitudinal studies are involved. Prevalidities assess the predictive power of a measure at an earlier point in time, offering a prospective evaluation of its usefulness.  This is in contrast to regular validity, which is assessed after the criterion is known. |  The researchers examined the prevalidities of the new aptitude test to determine its future predictive power.  = 研究人员检查了新能力倾向测试的预先有效性，以确定其未来的预测能力。


The study investigated the prevalidities of early childhood education programs on later academic achievement. = 这项研究调查了幼儿教育项目对以后学业成绩的预先有效性。| 近义词: predictive validity, prospective validity | 反义词:  None (it's a specific type of validity, not something with a direct opposite) | 名词
