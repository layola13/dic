Sisyphus: /ˈsɪsɪfəs/ | n. | 西西弗斯 |

英文解析: In Greek mythology, Sisyphus was a king who offended Zeus and was condemned to an eternity of fruitless labor in the underworld: repeatedly rolling a huge boulder up a hill, only to have it roll back down each time he neared the top.  The myth is used as a metaphor for a futile or endlessly repetitive task.
