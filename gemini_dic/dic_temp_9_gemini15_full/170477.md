词源:
The word "pruning" comes from the Old French word "prune," meaning "dried plum," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "prunus," meaning "plum tree." The connection lies in the practice of removing branches from plum trees to improve fruit production.  Over time, the word's meaning broadened to encompass the removal of unwanted parts from any plant or even abstract concepts.
