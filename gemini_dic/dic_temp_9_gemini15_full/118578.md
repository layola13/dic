mesostate:/ˈmezoʊˌsteɪt/| n. |中间态；介稳态；亚稳态 |A mesostate is an intermediate state, often unstable, that exists between two more stable states.  It's a temporary condition, typically characterized by a balance of forces that isn't truly stable and can easily shift to one of the more stable states.  The term is used in various scientific fields, particularly physics and chemistry, to describe systems in transition. |Example: The reaction proceeded through a short-lived mesostate before reaching equilibrium.  反应经过一个短暂的中间态后达到平衡。|近义词：intermediate state, transient state, metastable state |反义词：stable state, ground state
