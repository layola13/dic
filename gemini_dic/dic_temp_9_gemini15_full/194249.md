词源：

* **self-**:  From Old English *self, *sylf, meaning "self, same."  This prefix indicates something related to or done by oneself.

* **motivated**:  Derived from the verb "motivate," which comes from the Latin word *motivāre, meaning "to move."  This implies the act of providing someone with a reason or incentive to act.  The "-ed" suffix turns the verb into an adjective, describing something that is characterized by motivation.  The inherent motivation here is "self"-driven.
