The enforceability of a contract refers to the likelihood that a court will uphold the agreement and compel the parties to fulfill their obligations.  Several factors influence enforceability, including whether the agreement is in writing, whether both parties had the capacity to contract, whether there was consideration, and whether the terms are fair and legal.  An unenforceable contract is one that a court will not uphold due to a legal defect.

词源:

The word "enforceability" is derived from the verb "enforce" and the suffix "-ability."  "Enforce" comes from the Old French "enforcier," meaning "to strengthen" or "to put in force." The prefix "en-" means "in" or "into," and "force" refers to strength or power.  "-ability" is a suffix that creates nouns indicating capacity or potential. Therefore, "enforceability" literally means "the capability of being enforced" or "the state of being enforceable."
