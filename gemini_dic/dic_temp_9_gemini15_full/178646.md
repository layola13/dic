词源:

The word "recreant" comes from the Old French word "recreant," meaning "yielding, cowardly." This in turn derives from the verb "recreer," meaning "to yield, to fail." The ultimate origin is likely the Latin prefix "re-" (again) and a root related to "credere" (to believe), suggesting a loss or failure of belief or conviction.  The shift in meaning from simply "yielding" to specifically "cowardly" likely occurred over time.
