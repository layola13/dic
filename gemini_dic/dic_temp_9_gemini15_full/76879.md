词源:  From Middle English *gangrene, from Old French gangrène, from Late Latin gangraena, from Greek γάγγραινα (gangraina), from γάγγραινον (gangrainon), present participle of γαγγραίνω (gangrainō) "to eat away as a sore," from γάγγραινα (gangraina)  "sore, ulcer."  Ultimately, the word's roots are linked to the concept of something eating away or decaying.
