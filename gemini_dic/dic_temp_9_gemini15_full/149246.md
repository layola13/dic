The word "oyesses" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a regionalism, or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need to consider possibilities:

**Possibility 1: Misspelling**

It could be a misspelling of other words.  Depending on the intended meaning, it might be a misspelling of words like:

* **Yes:** /jɛs/ | interjection | 是的 | Expressing agreement or affirmation. | Example: "Yes, I understand." = "是的，我明白了。" | Near synonyms: yeah, yup, okay | Antonyms: no, nay

* **Oyez:** /oʊˈjeɪz/ | interjection | 肃静 | A call for attention, traditionally used in courts of law. | Example: "Oyez, oyez, oyez! Hear ye, hear ye!" = "肃静！肃静！肃静！听令！" |  Near synonyms:  attention, hark | Antonyms:  N/A


**Possibility 2: Regional Dialect or Slang**

It might be a word used within a specific community or region, not widely recognized.  More context is needed to understand its meaning and usage.


**Possibility 3:  Neologism/Made-up Word**

It could be a newly invented word, perhaps in a fictional context or created for a specific purpose.  Again, additional information is necessary.


To help me provide a proper analysis, please provide:

* **The context in which you encountered the word "oyesses."**  (e.g., a book, a conversation, a website)
* **The sentence or phrase where it appeared.**
* **Your best guess as to its intended meaning.**


With this information, I can offer a more accurate and helpful response.
