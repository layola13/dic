用法说明：

Recusancy is primarily a noun and is typically used in historical contexts to refer to the refusal to conform to established religious practices or laws.  It carries a connotation of deliberate and often principled resistance to authority.  While it can be used in a broader sense to describe any refusal to comply, its strongest association remains with religious nonconformity.  Modern usage is less common than its historical usage.
