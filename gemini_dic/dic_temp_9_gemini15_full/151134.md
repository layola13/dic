parataxis: /pærəˈtæksɪs/ | n. | 并列句法；并列结构 |

英文解析:Parataxis is a grammatical construction where clauses or phrases are placed one after another, without conjunctions or other connecting words to show their relationship.  The relationship between the clauses is implied rather than explicitly stated. This creates a sense of immediacy and speed, often mirroring the flow of thought or events.  It contrasts with hypotaxis, where clauses are linked by conjunctions and subordinate clauses.

例句:
I came, I saw, I conquered.  我来了，我看见了，我征服了。

She smiled, he frowned. 她笑了，他皱起了眉头。


近义词: coordination (in the grammatical sense), juxtaposition

反义词: hypotaxis

PHRASE->

Quick, sharp, decisive. 快速的，锐利的，果断的。
Loud, boisterous, chaotic.  喧闹的，喧嚣的，混乱的。
