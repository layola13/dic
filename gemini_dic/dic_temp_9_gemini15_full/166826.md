词源:
The phrase is a relatively modern idiom, combining the verb "press" (meaning to push or urge) with the noun "flesh" (referring to the physical body).  It likely evolved from the common practice of politicians shaking hands with many people to show themselves as approachable and connect with the public. The "pressing" aspect suggests a forceful or insistent nature to this interaction, sometimes implying a lack of genuine connection.
