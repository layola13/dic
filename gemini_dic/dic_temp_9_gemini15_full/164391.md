The word "preemy" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you clarify the intended word or provide more context?

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a slang term, or jargon specific to a particular community or field.  More context is needed.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name or a place name.
