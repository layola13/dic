USAGE->
This word is relatively uncommon and doesn't naturally lend itself to the typical grammatical tense examples like "What" examples shown in your model.  It's primarily used in legal and formal contexts.  Therefore, providing examples for all tenses is inappropriate.  Instead, we will focus on its usage in sentences.


Example Sentences:

The court ruled that there was no nonvitiation of the contract due to the lack of duress. = 法院裁定由于没有胁迫，合同未受损害。

The nonvitiation of the evidence was crucial to the prosecution's case. = 证据的完整性对检方的案件至关重要。


PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases directly using "nonvitiation."  Its usage is largely standalone within legal or formal writing.  Instead, related phrases emphasizing validity and integrity could be used:

in full force and effect:  仍然有效
free from defect:  没有缺陷
legally binding:  具有法律约束力
valid and enforceable:  有效且可执行
unimpaired: 未受损害
