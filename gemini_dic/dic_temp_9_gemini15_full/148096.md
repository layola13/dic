The word derives from the adjective "scrupulous," which comes from the Latin word "scrupulus," meaning "a small sharp stone" or "a difficulty."  The original sense referred to a feeling of uneasiness or doubt, later evolving to mean conscientious and careful.  The prefix "over-" indicates an excessive degree.
