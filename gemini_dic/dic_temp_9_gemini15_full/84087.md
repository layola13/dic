词源:

The word is a compound of "half" and "ingeniously".

* **half:**  From Old English *hǣlf, * healf, from Proto-Germanic *halbaz.  Meaning "one of two equal parts".

* **ingeniously:**  Derived from "ingenious," which comes from Latin *ingeniosus, from *ingenium ("innate quality, talent, genius").  "-iously" is an adverbial suffix.

Therefore, "half-ingeniously" literally means "in a manner that is only partially or somewhat ingenious."
