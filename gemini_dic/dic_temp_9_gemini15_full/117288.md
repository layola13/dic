词源:
The term "mechatronics" is a portmanteau of "mechanics" and "electronics," reflecting the core disciplines it integrates.  Its origins can be traced back to the 1960s in Japan, where the term was coined by Yaskawa Electric Corporation.  It quickly gained international recognition as a descriptor for this emerging field of engineering.
