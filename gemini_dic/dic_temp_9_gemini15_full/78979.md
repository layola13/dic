The word "girns" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries. It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Please double-check your spelling.
2. **It's a dialect word or slang:**  It might be used informally in a specific region or community.  If you heard it somewhere, providing context (e.g., where you heard it, who said it) would be helpful.
3. **It's a newly coined word:**  While unlikely, it's possible it's a very recent invention.


Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis including pronunciation, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as the word "girns" lacks established meaning in standard English.  To get a response, please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
