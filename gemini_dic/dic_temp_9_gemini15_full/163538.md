precorruption: /ˌpriːkəˈrʌpʃən/ | n. | 预先腐败；事前腐败；先期腐败 |  The act or process of corrupting something before it becomes fully established or developed;  the state of being corrupt before a specific event or system is fully formed. This often involves actions taken to influence or compromise the integrity of a system or process before it is implemented or established.


英文解析:Precorruption refers to the corrupting influence or actions that occur *before* a system, institution, or process is fully established or implemented.  It's about undermining integrity from the outset, rather than corruption occurring within an already-functioning system. This might involve bribery, influence peddling, or other unethical activities designed to shape the system to favor specific individuals or groups before it even begins to operate.
