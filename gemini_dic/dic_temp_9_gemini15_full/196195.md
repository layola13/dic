sequencers:/ˈsiːkwənsərz/ | n. | 测序仪；排序器；顺序发生器 | A sequencer is a device or program that arranges or determines the order of events or data.  It's commonly used in various fields, including music, biology, and computer science. In music, it helps create and arrange musical sequences. In biology, it's used in DNA sequencing. In computer science, it controls the order of operations in a program. | Example 1:  The music sequencer allowed the composer to easily arrange the complex melodies.  (音乐排序器让作曲家轻松地排列复杂的旋律。) Example 2:  Scientists used a high-throughput DNA sequencer to analyze the genomes. (科学家们使用高通量DNA测序仪来分析基因组。) |近义词：arranger, orchestrator, controller |反义词：randomizer, disorganizer |名词
