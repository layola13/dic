词源:
The word "humoured" derives from the Old French word "humoure," meaning "moisture, fluid, humour," which in turn comes from the Latin word "humor."  In medieval times, the four humors (blood, phlegm, choler, and melancholy) were believed to influence a person's temperament.  A "good humour" meant a balanced temperament, leading to cheerfulness, and thus the modern meaning evolved.
