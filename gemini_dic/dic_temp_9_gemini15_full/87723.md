hexene:/ˈhɛksiːn/| n. |己烯|Hexene refers to any of the several isomers of the alkene hydrocarbons with the formula C₆H₁₂ and containing one double bond.  They are colorless liquids with a gasoline-like odor.  Different isomers exhibit different properties. | Example:  The reaction yielded a mixture of hexene isomers.  该反应产生了一混合的己烯异构体。|近义词:  (depending on specific isomer) other alkenes|反义词:  (no direct antonym, but saturated alkanes like hexane are opposites in terms of saturation)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The chemist analyzes the hexene sample. = 化学家分析己烯样本。
This experiment uses pure hexene. = 这个实验使用纯己烯。


一般过去时:
