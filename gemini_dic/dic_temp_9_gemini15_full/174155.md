词源:

The term "Queen's Bench" derives from its historical association with the English monarch.  The court was originally presided over by the King (or Queen), and its name reflects this royal patronage.  The "benches" refers to the seats occupied by the judges.  With the change in monarch, the name changes accordingly, becoming the "King's Bench Division" under a male monarch.
