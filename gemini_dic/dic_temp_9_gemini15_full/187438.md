词源:
The word "roinish" is of Irish origin, ultimately deriving from the Irish word *ruan*, meaning "rustic" or "rural".  Its evolution into "roinish" reflects the evolution of Irish dialects and the transmission of words across cultural contexts. The word's association with boisterous merriment and uncouth behavior is a later development, reflecting a certain stereotype sometimes associated with rural Irish culture.
