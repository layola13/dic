词源:
The word "ratchet" ultimately derives from the Old French word *rochet*, meaning "a catch or pawl," possibly related to the Old High German word *rachen*, meaning "jaw" or "throat."  The clicking sound associated with a ratchet's operation further reinforces its connection to these earlier words.
