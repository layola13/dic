oxalate:/ˈɒksəleɪt/ | n. |草酸盐；草酸酯 | Oxalate refers to a salt or ester of oxalic acid.  Oxalates are found in many plants and are also produced by some metabolic processes in animals. They can form crystals and have various uses and implications for health and industry. | Example: Spinach is a good source of dietary oxalate.  菠菜是膳食草酸盐的良好来源。  Many kidney stones are composed of calcium oxalate. 许多肾结石是由草酸钙组成的。|近义词：oxalic acid salt (部分情况)|反义词：无直接反义词
