词源:
The word is a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "provincial" (relating to a province or having a narrow, limited outlook).  "Provincial" itself originates from the Latin word "provincia," meaning "province" or "territory under Roman rule."  The sense of narrow-mindedness associated with "provincial" developed later.
