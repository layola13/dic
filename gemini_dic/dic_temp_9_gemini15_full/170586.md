词源:
The word "pseudo-Christian" is a compound word.  "Pseudo-" is derived from the Greek word "ψευδής" (pseudēs), meaning "false" or "lying."  "Christian" derives from "Christ," referring to Jesus Christ, the central figure of Christianity.  Therefore, "pseudo-Christian" literally means "falsely Christian" or "pretending to be Christian."
