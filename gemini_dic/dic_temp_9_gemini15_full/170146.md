protogynous:/proʊˈtɒdʒɪnəs/ | adj. | 雌雄同体的；先雌后雄的 |  Referring to a species in which the individual is initially female and later becomes male.  This is a type of sequential hermaphroditism. | Example:  Clownfish are protogynous, meaning that all individuals are initially female and can later transition to male.  = 小丑鱼是先雌后雄的，这意味着所有个体最初都是雌性，之后可以转变为雄性。 | 近义词：sequentially hermaphroditic | 反义词：protandrous


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The clownfish exhibits protogynous characteristics. = 小丑鱼表现出先雌后雄的特征。
This species is protogynous in its reproductive strategy. = 这个物种在繁殖策略上是先雌后雄的。


一般过去时:
Researchers studied the protogynous development of the fish. = 研究人员研究了这种鱼的先雌后雄发育。
The scientist observed the protogynous transition in the coral reef. = 科学家观察了珊瑚礁中先雌后雄的转变。


现在完成时:
Scientists have documented many examples of protogynous hermaphroditism. = 科学家已经记录了许多先雌后雄的例子。
Researchers have observed that this species has a protogynous life cycle. = 研究人员观察到这个物种具有先雌后雄的生命周期。


过去完成时:
Before the dominant male died, the largest female had already begun the protogynous shift. = 在优势雄性死亡之前，最大的雌性已经开始先雌后雄的转变。
They had not previously encountered a species with such a pronounced protogynous phase. = 他们以前从未遇到过具有如此明显的先雌后雄阶段的物种。


将来时:
This research will further illuminate the mechanisms of protogynous sex change. = 这项研究将进一步阐明先雌后雄性别转变的机制。
Future studies will investigate the evolutionary pressures driving protogyny. = 未来的研究将调查驱动先雌后雄的进化压力。


虚拟语气:
If the dominant male were removed, the largest female would likely become male through protogyny. = 如果优势雄性被移除，最大的雌性很可能会通过先雌后雄转变为雄性。
If this species were not protogynous, its reproductive success would be compromised. = 如果这个物种不是先雌后雄的，它的繁殖成功率就会受到影响。


被动语态:
Protogynous sex change is often triggered by environmental factors. = 先雌后雄的性别转变通常是由环境因素触发的。
The mechanisms of protogynous development are being actively researched. = 先雌后雄发育的机制正在积极研究中。


疑问句:
Is this species protogynous or protandrous? = 这个物种是先雌后雄还是先雄后雌的？
What are the environmental cues that trigger protogynous sex change? = 触发先雌后雄性别转变的环境线索是什么？


否定句:
This species is not protogynous; it is protandrous. = 这个物种不是先雌后雄的；它是先雄后雌的。
The observed changes in the fish's reproductive system do not suggest a protogynous transition. = 鱼类生殖系统中观察到的变化并不表明先雌后雄的转变。


PHRASE->
protogynous hermaphroditism = 先雌后雄现象
protogynous sex change = 先雌后雄性别转变
sequential hermaphroditism (protogynous type) = 顺序雌雄同体（先雌后雄型）
