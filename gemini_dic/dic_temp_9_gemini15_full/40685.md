词源:  意大利语 conversazione, from converzare "to converse," from Latin conversari "to converse, live, behave," from com- "together" + versari "to turn, be occupied."  The word ultimately derives from the Latin verb *vertere*, meaning "to turn."  The idea is that conversation involves a turning of minds and ideas together.
