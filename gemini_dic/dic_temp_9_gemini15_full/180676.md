词源:  The word "regreen" is a relatively recent coinage, formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") to the adjective "green."  It reflects the growing environmental awareness and the increasing focus on ecological restoration.  There's no ancient etymology to trace back to, unlike words with long histories.
