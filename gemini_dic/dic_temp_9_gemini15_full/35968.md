The word "codeias" is not a valid English word.  There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries. It might be:

1. A misspelling:  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "codeine" or "codias"?  If so, please provide the correct spelling.

2. A technical term: It might be a term used in a specific field or jargon.  If this is the case, please provide context (e.g., the sentence where you found it, the subject area).

3. A proper noun: It could be a name or place name. Again, context is needed.

4. A non-English word: It might be a word from another language.  If so, please specify the language.


Without knowing the intended word or its context, I cannot provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, word class, meaning, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical patterns as requested.  Please clarify the word or provide more information.
