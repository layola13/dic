词源:

* **pro-**:  From Latin, meaning "in favor of," "supporting," or "for."
* **capitalism**: From "capital," referring to wealth or assets used in business, ultimately derived from Latin "capitalis" (of the head, chief, principal).  The "-ism" suffix denotes a system or doctrine.

Therefore, "pro-capitalism" literally means "in favor of the system of capitalism."
