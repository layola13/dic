polyzoon:/ˈpɒliˌzuːn/| n. |多孔动物；苔藓虫|A polyzoon is a small, aquatic invertebrate animal belonging to the phylum Bryozoa.  They are colonial organisms, meaning they live in large groups of interconnected individuals called zooids.  These colonies can form intricate structures, often resembling moss or small plants.  They are filter feeders, using specialized structures to trap microscopic food particles from the water.|Example:  The microscope revealed a complex colony of polyzoans attached to the seaweed.|近义词：bryozoan|反义词：无
