词源:
The word "dosimetry" is derived from the combination of "dose" and "metry."  "Dose" comes from the Old French "dose," meaning "a portion," ultimately from the Latin "dosis,"  meaning  "a giving." "Metry" comes from the Greek "μέτρον" (metron), meaning "measure."  Therefore, dosimetry literally means "the measurement of dose."
