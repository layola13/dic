词源:

The word "incommensurate" comes from the Latin prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "commensurate," which itself derives from the Latin "commensuratus," the past participle of "commensurare," meaning "to measure together."  Therefore, "incommensurate" literally means "not measured together" or "not having a common measure."


用法说明:

Incommensurate is primarily used as an adjective to describe two things that are disproportionate or unequal in size, degree, or value. It often implies a lack of balance or harmony between two elements.  It's frequently used to describe situations where something is too small or too large relative to something else, or where a punishment is too severe or too lenient given the offense.
