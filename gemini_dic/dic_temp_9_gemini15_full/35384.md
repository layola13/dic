词源:
The word "co-operate" is derived from the prefix "co-" (meaning "together" or "jointly") and the verb "operate" (meaning "to work," "to function," or "to be active").  The word therefore literally means "to work together."  The "co-" prefix has Latin origins (com-, con-), while "operate" traces back to the Latin "operari," meaning "to work."
