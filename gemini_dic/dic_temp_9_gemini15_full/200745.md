词源:
The word "sleightful" is derived from the Middle English word "slight," meaning "skill," "dexterity," or "cleverness."  This word, in turn, comes from the Old Norse word "slægr," meaning "sly," "clever," or "cunning."  Over time, "slight" took on a more negative connotation, implying trickery or deception, while "sleightful" retains both the positive sense of dexterity and the negative sense of cunning.
