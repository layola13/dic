词源:

The word "self-emancipations" is a compound word.

* **self-**:  A prefix meaning "of or by oneself."  It originates from Old English *self, *sylf.

* **emancipation**:  This comes from the Late Latin *emancipationem, a noun derived from the verb *emancipare.  *Emancipare is composed of:
    * *e-*  (out, from)
    * *mancipium* (possession, power)
    * *-are* (verb suffix)

Therefore, the word literally means "the act of freeing oneself from possession or power."  The modern meaning has broadened to encompass various forms of liberation.
