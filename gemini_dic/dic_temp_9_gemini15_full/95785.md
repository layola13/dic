词源:

The word "incontrovertibilities" is derived from the adjective "incontrovertible," which itself comes from the prefix "in-" (not), "controvert" (to dispute or oppose), and the suffix "-ible" (capable of).  Therefore, "incontrovertible" means "not capable of being disputed" or "undeniable."  Adding the suffix "-ilities" creates the plural noun form, referring to multiple instances or aspects of something incontrovertible.
