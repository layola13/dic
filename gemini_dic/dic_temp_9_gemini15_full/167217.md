pretensioning: /prɪˈtɛnʃənɪŋ/ | n. | 预应力 | The process of applying a tensile force to a structural element before it is subjected to other loads.  This initial tension improves the strength and durability of the structure by counteracting compressive forces that would otherwise cause cracking or failure.  For example, in prestressed concrete, steel tendons are tensioned before the concrete is poured, creating a compressive force in the concrete that resists the tensile stresses caused by external loads. | The bridge was built using pretensioning techniques to enhance its load-bearing capacity.  这桥梁使用了预应力技术来增强其承重能力。  The pretensioning of the cables was carefully monitored. 电缆的预应力受到仔细监控。 | prestressing, stressing | (None readily available,  the opposite would be  applying compressive force before external loads) |  n.

词源:

The word "pretensioning" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the verb "tensioning" (the act of applying tension).  Therefore, it literally means "tensioning beforehand".
