词源:

The word "extendibility" is derived from the verb "extend," which comes from the Old French word "estendre," meaning "to stretch out" or "to spread."  The suffix "-ibility" indicates the capability or quality of being able to be extended.  Therefore, extendibility signifies the inherent capacity of something to be stretched, enlarged, or improved upon.
