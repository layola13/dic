The word "pi-dog" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a slang term, or a neologism (newly coined word) specific to a certain region or community.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide a response in the requested format, I need a valid English word.
