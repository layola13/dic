The word "focom" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or looking word?
* **It's a technical term:** It might be an abbreviation or a term specific to a particular field (science, technology, etc.).  If you can provide context (where you encountered the word), it might be possible to identify its meaning.
* **It's a newly coined word:**  It's possible it's a very recent invention or slang term not yet widely recognized.
