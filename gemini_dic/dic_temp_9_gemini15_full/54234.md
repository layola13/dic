词源：

The word "disgallant" is formed with the prefix "dis-" meaning "not" or "opposite of," and the word "gallant."  "Gallant" itself has a rich history, originating from the Old French word "galant," meaning "lover, gallant, brave." This word further traces back to the Vulgar Latin *gallus, meaning "cock," possibly referring to the cock's showy behavior.  Over time, "gallant" came to mean "brave," then "courteous and attentive," especially towards women. Therefore, "disgallant" directly opposes the positive connotations of chivalry and courteousness associated with "gallant."
