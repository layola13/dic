disassemblers:/ˌdɪs.əˈsɛm.blər/| n. |反汇编器|A disassembler is a computer program that translates machine code into assembly language.  This process is the reverse of assembly, which translates assembly language into machine code. Disassemblers are often used in reverse engineering, software analysis, and debugging.  | Example: The programmer used a disassembler to understand the functionality of the compiled program.  程序员使用反汇编器来理解已编译程序的功能。|近义词：decompiler (though decompilers aim for higher-level languages)|反义词：assembler|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The disassembler converts machine code into assembly language. = 反汇编器将机器码转换为汇编语言。
This program uses a powerful disassembler. = 这个程序使用一个强大的反汇编器。


一般过去时:
The security team disassembled the malware to understand its operation. = 安全团队反汇编了恶意软件以了解其运作方式。
I disassembled the executable file yesterday. = 我昨天反汇编了可执行文件。


现在完成时:
Researchers have used disassemblers to identify vulnerabilities in software. = 研究人员已经使用反汇编器来识别软件中的漏洞。
We have successfully disassembled the encrypted code. = 我们已经成功地反汇编了加密代码。


过去完成时:
They had disassembled the program before analyzing its behavior. = 他们在分析程序行为之前已经将其反汇编了。
The experts had disassembled the sample before reporting their findings. = 专家们在报告调查结果之前已经反汇编了样本。


将来时:
We will use a disassembler to inspect the application's internals. = 我们将使用反汇编器来检查应用程序的内部结构。
The team will disassemble the firmware for analysis. = 团队将反汇编固件进行分析。


虚拟语气:
If we had a better disassembler, we could analyze the code more efficiently. = 如果我们有一个更好的反汇编器，我们可以更有效地分析代码。
I wish I had used a more advanced disassembler. = 我希望我使用了更高级的反汇编器。


被动语态:
The code was disassembled by the analyst. = 代码被分析师反汇编了。
The malware sample is being disassembled for further investigation. = 恶意软件样本正在被反汇编以进行进一步调查。


疑问句:
Which disassembler are you using? = 你在使用哪个反汇编器？
Does this disassembler support all architectures? = 这个反汇编器支持所有架构吗？


否定句:
The disassembler didn't correctly handle the complex instructions. = 反汇编器没有正确处理复杂的指令。
He couldn't disassemble the code because it was heavily obfuscated. = 他无法反汇编代码，因为它被严重混淆了。


PHRASE->
disassembler output = 反汇编器输出
interactive disassembler = 交互式反汇编器
command-line disassembler = 命令行反汇编器
static disassembler = 静态反汇编器
dynamic disassembler = 动态反汇编器
