PHRASE->
There is no common multi-word phrase directly using "misinstructed".  The adjective functions independently.  However, phrases can be built around it, for example:
* badly misinstructed  严重误导
* deliberately misinstructed  故意误导
* seriously misinstructed  非常误导
* completely misinstructed  彻底误导
* grossly misinstructed  极度误导


词源:
The word "misinstructed" is formed by combining the prefix "mis-" (meaning wrongly or badly) with the past participle of the verb "instruct" (to teach or direct).  "Instruct" comes from the Latin word "instruere," meaning "to build up," "to arrange," or "to furnish."  Therefore, "misinstructed" literally means "wrongly built up" or "wrongly furnished with information."
