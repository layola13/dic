词源:

The word is a combination of:

* **quasi-**:  A prefix of Latin origin meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "as if."
* **spirited**: An adjective meaning lively, energetic, and enthusiastic.  Its origin is from the Old English word "spirited," related to "spirit."

Therefore, "quasispiritedly" describes an action done in a way that *seems* spirited, but is not truly so.  It suggests a lack of genuine energy or enthusiasm.
