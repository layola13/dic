preallowably: /ˌpriːəˈlaʊəbli/ | adj. | 可预先允许地；预先可允许地 |  This word is not found in standard English dictionaries. It appears to be a newly coined word, formed by combining "pre-" (before), "allow" (to permit), and "-able" (capable of being).  It suggests something that can be permitted in advance.  Due to its non-standard nature, there are no established usages, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical examples.  The word itself needs context for meaning. For example, in a hypothetical context, one might say "preallowably accessible data," meaning data that is permitted to be accessed before a certain point in time. However, more common and clearer alternatives would be preferable in formal writing or speech.
