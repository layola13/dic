词源:

The word "noncorruptible" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "corruptible" (meaning "susceptible to corruption").  "Corruptible" ultimately derives from the Latin word "corruptus," the past participle of "corrumpere," meaning "to break," "to destroy," or "to spoil."  This reflects the sense of moral decay or undermining of integrity associated with corruption.
