词源:  The word "reechy" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "reche," meaning "reach" or "stretch."  Over time, its meaning shifted to imply excessive reaching or grasping, particularly in the context of greed or ambition.  The modern usage retains this sense of immoderate desire and often carries a negative connotation.
