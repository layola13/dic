词源:
The word "overimpose" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "above," "beyond," or "excessively") and the verb "impose" (meaning "to force something on someone or something").  Therefore, it literally means "to impose something on top of something else." The word reflects a relatively modern usage, emerging as the need to describe the layering of digital or visual elements increased.
