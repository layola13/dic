词源:  The word "crimeful" is formed by adding the suffix "-ful" (meaning "full of") to the noun "crime".  This suffix pattern is common in English to create adjectives describing a state of being full of something.  The word's origins trace back to the Old French "crim," meaning "accusation, offense," ultimately from the Latin "crimen" with the same meaning.
