The word "butchest" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), slang, or a word specific to a particular dialect or community.

To help, you could provide more context where you encountered this word. This context might help determine its meaning and allow for a more accurate analysis. For example, telling me the sentence it was used in, or the source where you saw it, would be very useful.
