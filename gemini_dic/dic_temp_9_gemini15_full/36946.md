词源:  The word "colourer" is derived from the word "colour" (or "color" in American English), which comes from the Old French word "color" and ultimately from the Latin word "color," meaning "appearance, complexion, hue."  The suffix "-er" is an agentive suffix, indicating a person or thing that performs the action of the verb.
