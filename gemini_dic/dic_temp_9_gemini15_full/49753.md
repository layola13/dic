词源:  The word "demoisturizing" is a combination of "de-" (meaning "remove" or "opposite of") and "moisturizing."  "Moisturizing" itself is derived from "moisture" (a state of being moist) and the "-izing" suffix, which indicates the process of making something moist.  Therefore, "demoisturizing" describes the process of removing moisture.
