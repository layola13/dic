The word "coreferentialities" is a noun formed from the adjective "coreferential" and the suffix "-ities," indicating a plural or abstract quality.

**Etymology:**

* **co-:**  prefix indicating togetherness or joint action.
* **refer-:**  from Latin *referre*, meaning "to carry back," "to bring back," or "to relate to."  In linguistics, it refers to the relationship between a linguistic expression and the entity it denotes.
* **-ential:**  suffix forming adjectives from verbs or nouns, indicating relating to or characterized by.
* **-ity:**  suffix forming nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.


**Usage:**

Coreferentialities primarily appear in linguistics and computational linguistics.  It refers to the instances and properties of coreference within a text or discourse.  Coreference is the grammatical or semantic relationship between two or more expressions that refer to the same entity.  The study of coreferentialities examines how these relationships are established, maintained, and resolved in language.

**Examples:**

* "John went to the store. He bought milk."  "John" and "He" are coreferential; they both refer to the same person. The analysis of this coreference would fall under the study of coreferentialities.

* "The cat sat on the mat. The feline was purring." "The cat" and "The feline" are coreferential; they both refer to the same animal.  The linguistic mechanisms enabling the understanding of this coreference are part of the field of coreferentialities.

*  A complex sentence with multiple pronouns and noun phrases referring to the same entities presents a rich area for the study of coreferentialities.  For example, analyzing how a reader or listener correctly links all instances of "the president," "he," "his administration," and "the commander-in-chief" in a given text is an investigation into coreferentialities.

**Note:**  There are no readily available antonyms for "coreferentialities" in the same way there are for simpler terms like "reference." The opposite concept would be situations where there is no coreference, such as ambiguity or the use of different words to refer to different entities, even if the context might lead one to initially assume coreference.  This lack of a direct antonym reflects the specialized nature of the term.
