podotheca: /ˌpɒdəˈθiːkə/ | n. |孢子囊 | A podotheca is a specialized structure in certain fungi and plants that produces and contains spores.  It is often a type of fruiting body, analogous to a sporangium but often with a more complex structure.  The term is particularly used in describing the spore-bearing structures of certain liverworts and mosses.  | Example: The podotheca of this liverwort species exhibits a unique morphology.  这个苔类植物的孢子囊显示出独特的形态。 | 近义词: sporangium (less specific)| 反义词:  None directly, but structures that do not produce spores could be considered antonyms conceptually. | 名词
