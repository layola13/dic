retempering:/ˌriːˈtɛmpərɪŋ/ | n. | 再调质；重新回火 | The process of reheating and cooling a metal to improve its properties, such as strength, toughness, or ductility.  This involves carefully controlling the temperature and cooling rate to achieve the desired microstructure and mechanical properties.  It's often used to refine the grain structure of a metal or to relieve internal stresses. | The blacksmith carefully performed the retempering of the sword blade, ensuring its optimal sharpness and strength.  铁匠仔细地对剑刃进行了再调质，以确保其最佳的锋利度和强度。 | annealing, hardening | softening |
