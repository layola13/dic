idiocyclophanous: /ˌɪdiːoʊsaɪkləˈfeɪnəs/ | adj. | 独特性周期性显现的；(指化学结构)具有独特的环状结构且能透光的 |  Describes a chemical structure, particularly in cyclophanes, that exhibits unique cyclic properties and allows light transmission. The term combines "idio-" (peculiar, unique), "cyclo-" (cyclic, ring-shaped), and "-phanous" (transparent, translucent).  It implies a specific and unusual arrangement of rings within the molecule that results in some degree of transparency.  There are no readily available examples of sentences using this word in common literature or scientific publications because it's a highly specialized term used within a niche area of chemistry.  The word's rarity precludes the possibility of finding readily available synonyms or antonyms. |  词性:形容词


USAGE->

This word is highly specialized and doesn't appear in common usage.  Therefore, providing example sentences in various tenses is not practical.  The word would primarily appear in highly technical chemical papers and would typically be used in descriptions of a specific molecule's structure and properties.  For example, a sentence might read:

"The newly synthesized idiocyclophanous compound exhibited unexpected optical properties due to its unique ring conformation." = 新合成的具有独特性周期性显现的化合物由于其独特的环状构象而表现出意想不到的光学特性。


PHRASE->

N/A (Due to the highly specialized nature of the word, no common phrases exist.)
