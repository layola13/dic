词源:

The word "endeavour" comes from the Old French word "endevorer," which itself likely derives from the Old French "devoir" (to owe) combined with a prefix meaning "in" or "towards."  The modern spelling evolved over time.  The sense of "striving" developed from the original meaning of "to make an effort to do what one owes," which gradually shifted to a more general meaning of striving or attempting.
