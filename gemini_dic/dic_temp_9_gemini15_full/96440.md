词源:

* **in-**:  prefix meaning "not" or "without"
* **distinguish**: verb meaning "to recognize or treat (someone or something) as different"
* **-able**: suffix making an adjective from a verb, meaning "capable of being"
* **-ly**: suffix turning an adjective into an adverb


The word is formed by combining the negative prefix "in-" with the adjectival form "distinguishable" and adding the adverbial suffix "-ly".  Therefore, "indistinguishably" means "in a way that cannot be distinguished".
