The word "interindicated" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  If you can provide the intended word or more context, I can offer a more accurate analysis.
