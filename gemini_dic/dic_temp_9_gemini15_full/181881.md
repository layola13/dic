reluctivity: /rɪˌlʌkˈtɪvɪti/ | n. | 磁阻；磁惰性 | Reluctivity is a measure of a material's opposition to the establishment of a magnetic flux.  It is the reciprocal of permeability.  A high reluctivity indicates a material is difficult to magnetize, while a low reluctivity indicates easy magnetization. | The high reluctivity of this material makes it unsuitable for use in transformers.  这种材料的高磁阻使其不适合用在变压器中。| permeability | conductivity |
