词源:
From Latin *fervere "to boil, be hot," related to fervens, present participle of fervere.  The -escent suffix indicates a process of becoming or tending toward a state.  Therefore, "fervescent" literally means "becoming hot" or "growing hot,"  metaphorically extended to describe an increasing intensity of feeling or activity.
