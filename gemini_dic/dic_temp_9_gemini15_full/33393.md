词源:
The word "church" ultimately derives from the Greek word "kyriakon," meaning "Lord's house" or "belonging to the Lord."  This term evolved into the Old English word "circe," then to "church" in Middle English.  The root reflects the early association of Christian worship with a dedicated building.
