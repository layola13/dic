homothally:/ˌhoʊməˈθæli/| n. |同宗配合；自体受精|The ability of a plant or fungus to reproduce sexually by self-fertilization; the condition of being homothallic.  A homothallic organism possesses both male and female reproductive structures, allowing self-fertilization.  This contrasts with heterothally, where separate individuals are required for sexual reproduction. |Example: Many fungal species exhibit homothally, enabling them to reproduce even in isolation.  许多真菌物种表现出同宗配合，使它们即使在隔离状态下也能繁殖。|近义词：self-fertilization, autogamy |反义词：heterothally

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The fungus exhibits homothally. = 这真菌表现出同宗配合。
This plant is homothallic. = 这种植物是同宗配合的。


一般过去时:
The researcher observed homothally in the sample. = 研究人员在样本中观察到同宗配合。
The experiment demonstrated homothally. = 实验证明了同宗配合。


现在完成时:
Scientists have documented homothally in various species. = 科学家们已经在各种物种中记录了同宗配合。
Researchers have confirmed the homothally of this strain. = 研究人员证实了该菌株的同宗配合性。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, homothally was unknown in this genus. = 在发现之前，这个属中未知同宗配合。
They had already established that the organism was homothallic. = 他们已经确定该生物是同宗配合的。


将来时:
Further studies will investigate homothally in this context. = 进一步的研究将研究在这种情况下同宗配合。
We will determine whether the species is homothallic or heterothallic. = 我们将确定该物种是同宗配合还是异宗配合。


虚拟语气:
If the organism were homothallic, it could reproduce easily. = 如果该生物是同宗配合的，它就能很容易地繁殖。
It would be advantageous if all strains were homothallic. = 如果所有菌株都是同宗配合的，那将是有利的。


被动语态:
Homothally was observed in the experiment. = 在实验中观察到同宗配合。
The homothally of this species has been confirmed. = 这种物种的同宗配合性已得到证实。


疑问句:
Is this species homothallic or heterothallic? = 这个物种是同宗配合还是异宗配合？
Does homothally confer any selective advantage? = 同宗配合是否赋予任何选择优势？


否定句:
This species is not homothallic; it requires two individuals for reproduction. = 这个物种不是同宗配合的；它需要两个个体才能繁殖。
The fungus did not exhibit homothally under these conditions. = 在这些条件下，真菌没有表现出同宗配合。
