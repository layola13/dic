词源:

The word "mightful" is a combination of "might" and "-ful".  "Might" derives from Old English *miht, meaning "strength, power," related to the verb "may," which indicates possibility or permission. The suffix "-ful" is an Old English suffix meaning "full of," thus creating the adjective "mightful," meaning "full of might" or "powerful."


用法说明:

Although grammatically correct, "mightful" is considered somewhat archaic and less common than its synonyms "powerful," "mighty," or "formidable." It's typically used in more literary or elevated contexts to emphasize strength or power, often with a sense of awe or grandeur. While it can describe physical strength, it also applies to other forms of power, such as influence or authority.  It is less frequently used in everyday conversation.
