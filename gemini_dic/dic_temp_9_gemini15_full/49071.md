词源:

The word "dehydrated" is derived from the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to deprive of") and the word "hydrated," which in turn comes from the Greek word "hydor" (meaning "water") and the suffix "-ated" (meaning "to make or become").  Therefore, "dehydrated" literally means "deprived of water."
