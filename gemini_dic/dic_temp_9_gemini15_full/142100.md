词源:
The word "orientating" comes from the word "orient," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "oriens," meaning "rising (of the sun)."  The East was traditionally considered the "Orient," and thus the word became associated with finding one's bearings and direction, especially in relation to the rising sun.  The "-ing" suffix indicates the present participle form of the verb.
