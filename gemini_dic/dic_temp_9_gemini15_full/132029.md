词源：

The word "noncorroborative" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "corroborative."  "Corroborative" comes from the Latin verb "corroborare," meaning "to strengthen," "to confirm," or "to make firm."  This verb is composed of "con-" (together) and "roborare" (to strengthen).  Therefore, "noncorroborative" literally means "not strengthening" or "not confirming."
