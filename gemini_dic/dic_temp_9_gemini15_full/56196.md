词源:  The word "dodger" ultimately derives from the verb "to dodge," meaning to avoid something by a quick movement.  This verb's origins trace back to the Middle English word "doggen," which meant "to thrust, push, or shove."  The sense of evading or avoiding developed over time. The specific application to a person who evades responsibility or the law came later.
