词源:

The word "polishing" derives from the verb "polish," which comes from the Old French word "poliss-, polir" meaning "to polish, make smooth, burnish."  This in turn has roots in the Late Latin word "polire," meaning "to polish, smooth."  The ultimate origin is likely the Proto-Indo-European root *mel- meaning "to grind."
