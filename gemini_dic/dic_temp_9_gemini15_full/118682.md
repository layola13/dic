metabolizabilities:/ˌmɛtæbɒlɪˈzeɪbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可代谢性 | The extent to which a substance can be metabolized by an organism.  It refers to the ability of a living organism to break down a substance into simpler components through metabolic processes.  The higher the metabolizability, the more efficiently the organism can use the substance for energy or building blocks. | Example: The metabolizability of this drug is high, meaning it is quickly processed by the body.  这个药物的可代谢性很高，这意味着它会被身体快速代谢。  The metabolizability of different types of fiber varies widely depending on their chemical structure. 不同类型纤维的可代谢性差异很大，取决于它们的化学结构。 | 近义词：bioavailability, biodegradability | 反义词：resistance to metabolism
