词源:
The word "nonfeasible" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "feasible" (meaning "possible to do easily or successfully").  "Feasible" itself comes from the Old French word "faisable," ultimately deriving from the Latin "facere" (to do or make).  Therefore, "nonfeasible" literally means "not possible to do."
