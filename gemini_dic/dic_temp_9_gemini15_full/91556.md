词性：形容词


词源:

The word is a combination of the prefix "hyper-" (meaning "excessive," "beyond," or "above") and the adjective "natural."  "Hyper-" comes from Greek ὑπέρ (hupér), meaning "over," "above," or "beyond."  "Natural" derives from Latin *naturalis, from natura ("nature").  Therefore, "hyper-natural" literally means "beyond natural" or "excessively natural."  The combination creates a nuanced meaning that encompasses both an exceeding of the natural and a simulation of the natural.
