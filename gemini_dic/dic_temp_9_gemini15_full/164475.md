preentertainments:/ˌpriːˌɛntəˈteɪnmənts/ | n. | 预先娱乐；开场节目 |  There is no established word "preentertainments" in standard English dictionaries. It appears to be a nonce word, a word coined for a specific occasion or context.  It likely combines "pre-" (meaning before) and "entertainments" (meaning forms of amusement or diversion).  Therefore, it would logically refer to activities or events that take place *before* the main entertainment begins. For example, pre-show music or a brief introduction.  | Example: The pre-show preentertainments included a live jazz band and a slideshow of previous performances.  预演前的预先娱乐节目包括现场爵士乐队和之前的演出幻灯片展示。 |近义词:  pre-show activities, preliminary entertainment, opening acts | 反义词:  after-show entertainment, post-performance activities|  名词
