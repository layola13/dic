词源:

The word "curlicue" likely originated as a combination of "curl" and a diminutive suffix "-ique" (or a similar form).  The "-ique" suffix, common in words borrowed from French, suggests a small or delicate version of something.  Thus, "curlicue" describes a small, decorative curl.  The exact etymological path is debated, but the blend of "curl" and a diminutive suffix is the most plausible explanation.
