词源:
The word "croak" likely originates from an Old French word (possibly *croquer),  meaning "to crack, crunch."  The onomatopoeic quality, imitating the sound of a frog, contributed to its widespread adoption and association with the amphibian's call.  The sense of dying may be derived from the association of a dying person's weak, raspy voice with the sound of a frog's croak.
