词源:
The word "forestalling" comes from the Old French word "forestaller," which means "to anticipate" or "to outstrip."  This, in turn, has roots in the Old French "forest" (forest) and "estaler" (to spread out, display).  The original sense referred to merchants who bought up goods before they reached the market to manipulate prices, a practice that was illegal in many historical contexts.  Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass the more general sense of preventing or hindering something.
