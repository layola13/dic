词源：

The word "indefinably" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the adjective "definable" (meaning "capable of being defined"), and the suffix "-ly" (forming an adverb).  "Definable" itself comes from the verb "define," ultimately from Latin "definire" (to limit, to mark the boundaries of),  combining "de-" (away, off) and "finire" (to finish, to bound).


用法说明：

"Indefinably" is an adverb used to modify verbs, adjectives, or entire clauses.  It emphasizes the inability to express or understand something fully through language. It often describes experiences, feelings, or qualities that are intensely personal or subjective.
