presurrounding: /ˌpriːsəˈraʊndɪŋ/ | adj. | 预先围绕的，事先包围的 |  This word is not a standard English word found in reputable dictionaries. It appears to be a newly coined or rarely used word formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before) and "surrounding" (meaning the things or people around something).  It implies something that surrounds something else before a particular event or time.  There is no established meaning or usage.  Therefore, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical usage is not possible.  The word would need to be defined within a specific context.
