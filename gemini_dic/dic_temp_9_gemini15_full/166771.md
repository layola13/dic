presocialism:/ˌpriːˈsoʊʃəlɪzəm/ | n. |前社会主义，准社会主义 | A system or ideology that precedes or anticipates full socialism, often characterized by elements of both capitalism and socialism.  It might involve state intervention in the economy to address social issues but without complete state ownership of the means of production.  The term is often used descriptively rather than prescriptively, analyzing historical or contemporary systems that don't neatly fit into either pure capitalism or pure socialism. | Example: Some scholars argue that certain aspects of the Bismarckian era in Germany represent a form of presocialism.  一些学者认为德国俾斯麦时代的一些方面代表着一种准社会主义。 | 近义词：proto-socialism, state capitalism (in some contexts) | 反义词：pure capitalism, pure socialism
