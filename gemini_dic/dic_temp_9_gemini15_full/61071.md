词源:
From the Greek word "ellipsis" (ἔλλειψις), meaning "omission" or "defect," ultimately deriving from the verb "elleipein" (ἐλλείπειν), "to be deficient," "to fail," or "to leave out."  The geometric sense of "ellipse" is related, referring to a shape that is "deficient" or incomplete compared to a circle.
