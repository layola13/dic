The word "forpass" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word, possibly specific to a particular context or community.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is not possible.  To provide such an analysis, I would need the correct word or more context about its intended meaning.
