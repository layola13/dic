rereminding:/ˌriːrɪˈmaɪndɪŋ/ | v. | 再次提醒；反复提醒 |  The act of reminding someone again, often repeatedly.  This is not a standard English word; it's a non-standard formation of "re-reminding."  It implies a more forceful or insistent reminding than a single reminder. |例句：He kept rereminding me about the deadline, even though I'd already written it down. 他不停地提醒我截止日期，即使我已经把它记下来了。


There are no standard examples of usage for "rereminding" because it is not a standard word.  The grammar would be the same as the verb "remind"  with the added emphasis of repetition and insistence.
