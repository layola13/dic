词源:
The word "ethanol" comes from the combination of "eth-" (referring to the ethyl group, C2H5) and "-anol" (a suffix indicating a type of alcohol).  The ethyl group itself is derived from "ether," referring to a class of organic compounds.  The "-ol" suffix is from the chemical nomenclature for alcohols.
