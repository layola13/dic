predeterminers:/ˌpriːdɪˈtɜːrmɪnərz/ | n. | 准限定词 |  Predeterminers are words that come before and modify other determiners (like articles, demonstratives, possessive pronouns, and quantifiers) to further specify the noun phrase. They are a type of adjective functioning to limit or specify the noun.  They include words like *all*, *both*, *half*, *double*, *twice*, *such*, and *what*.  Unlike determiners that directly modify nouns, predeterminers modify the determiners which then modify the nouns. | Example: All the students passed the exam. (All modifies the determiner "the")  Both my parents are doctors. (Both modifies the determiner "my") Half the cake is left. (Half modifies the determiner "the") | 近义词: (depending on the specific predeterminer used, there may be synonyms for the individual words.  There isn't a direct synonym for the grammatical category as a whole) | 反义词: (No direct antonyms, as it depends on the specific predeterminer) | n.
