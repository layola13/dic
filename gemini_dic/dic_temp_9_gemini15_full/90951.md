The word "Huron" refers to a Native American people, originally inhabiting the area around the Great Lakes in North America.  The name's origin is debated, but it may derive from a French word meaning "wild" or "hairy," possibly reflecting early European encounters. The Huron are also known as the Wendat, which is their autonym (self-designation).  They are known for their sophisticated political and social organization and their significant role in the fur trade.
