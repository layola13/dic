Comes from the Latin word "indigere," meaning "to be in need" or "to lack."


用法说明:

Indigent is primarily used as an adjective to describe people or situations characterized by poverty.  It suggests a lack of essential resources and often implies a state of destitution.  While it can be used to describe a single individual, it's more commonly applied to groups or communities.  The word carries a slightly more formal tone than some synonyms like "poor."
