neomembrane:/ˈniːoʊˌmɛmbreɪn/ | n. | 新膜，新生膜 | A newly formed membrane, especially one formed during cell division or differentiation.  It often refers to the membranes that are synthesized and assembled during processes like endocytosis or exocytosis, or during the formation of new organelles. |Example: The neomembrane quickly sealed the rupture in the cell wall. 新膜迅速封住了细胞壁上的破裂。 The study focused on the protein composition of the neomembrane during vesicle formation.  该研究重点关注囊泡形成过程中新生膜的蛋白质组成。|近义词：new membrane, nascent membrane |反义词：old membrane, mature membrane
