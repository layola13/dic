The word "coinest" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following your requested format.  To help you, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered "coinest."
