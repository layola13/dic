词源：

The word "overmagnified" is composed of three parts:

* **over-**:  A prefix meaning "excessively" or "too much".
* **magnify**:  To make something appear larger than it is, either literally or figuratively.  This word comes from the Latin "magnificare," combining "magnus" (great) and "facere" (to make).

Therefore, "overmagnified" literally means "made too large" or "exaggerated excessively."
