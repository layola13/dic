词源:

* **poly-**:  from Greek πολύς (polús), meaning "many," "much."
* **morph-**: from Greek μορφή (morphḗ), meaning "form," "shape."
* **-ously**: an adverbial suffix indicating "in a ... manner" or "to a ... extent."

Therefore, "polymorphously" literally means "in a many-shaped manner" or "to a great extent in many forms."  The word reflects the Greek roots and combines them with a standard English adverbial suffix.
