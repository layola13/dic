macrozooespore:/ˌmækrəʊˈzoʊəˌspɔːr/| n. |大型游动孢子|A large motile spore, typically found in certain algae and fungi.  These spores are larger than microspores and are capable of independent movement, usually by means of flagella. They are involved in asexual reproduction.|Example: The release of macrozooespores contributed significantly to the rapid spread of the algae bloom.|近义词: zoospore, spore|反义词: microspore
