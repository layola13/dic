The word "riptowel" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries or word databases.  It's likely a misspelling, a newly coined word, a brand name, or a word specific to a particular context (e.g., slang, jargon).  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.


To get a helpful response, please provide more context where you encountered this word.  For example:

* Where did you see or hear this word?
* What was the surrounding text or conversation?
* Can you provide an image if it's a brand name?


With more information, I can offer a more accurate interpretation and analysis.
