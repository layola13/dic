词源：

The word is a participial adjective formed from the verb phrase "clean out," which means to completely empty or remove everything from something.  "Clean" here signifies thoroughness and completeness, not necessarily cleanliness in the literal sense. The "out" emphasizes the removal of contents.  The evolution is a simple combination of the verb "clean" and the adverb "out," evolving into a descriptive adjective over time.
