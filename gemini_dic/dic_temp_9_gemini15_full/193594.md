词源：

The word "self-assertive" is a compound word formed from "self" and "assertive."

* **Self:**  From Old English *self, *sylf, meaning "same, very."  It denotes the individual's own identity or nature.

* **Assertive:** From the verb "assert," which comes from Old French *assertir ("to affirm, confirm, maintain") ultimately from Latin *ad- ("to") + *serere ("to join, connect").  It carries the meaning of confidently stating or defending one's rights or opinions.
