evangelicalism: /ˌiːvænˈdʒɛlɪkəlɪzəm/ | n. |福音派；福音主义 |

英文解析：Evangelicalism is a worldwide, transdenominational movement within Protestant Christianity that emphasizes a personal relationship with God through Jesus Christ, the Bible as the ultimate authority, and the importance of evangelization (spreading the Gospel).  It encompasses a wide range of beliefs and practices, and there is significant diversity within evangelicalism itself.  Key characteristics often include a belief in the Bible's inerrancy or infallibility, a focus on conversion and personal spiritual experience, and a commitment to missionary work.
