词源:  Derived from the adjective "compelling," which comes from the verb "compel" (meaning to force or oblige).  The "-ingly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb.  The root of "compel" can be traced back to the Latin word "compellere," which is a combination of "com-" (together) and "pellere" (to drive or push).
