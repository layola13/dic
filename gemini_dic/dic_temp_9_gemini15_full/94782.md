PHRASE->

There aren't common verb phrases directly using "impudentness" as a core element.  Phrases would typically involve adjectives derived from it (impudent) or related concepts (show impudence, act with impudentness).  For example:

to show impudentness 表现无礼


词源:

Impudentness derives from the adjective "impudent," which comes from the Old French word "impudent," meaning "shameless." This, in turn, comes from the Latin "impudēns," formed from "in-" (not) + "pudēns" (modest, shy).  Therefore, the word's core meaning traces back to a lack of modesty or shame.
