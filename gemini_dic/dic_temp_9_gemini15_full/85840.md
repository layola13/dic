/ˈhɑːrdʒəfəʊz/ | n. |氢氟烃|Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are a group of chemical compounds that contain hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon.  They are used as refrigerants, propellants, and solvents.  HFCs were developed as replacements for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) because they do not deplete the ozone layer as severely. However, they are still potent greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change. |The increasing use of HFCs contributes to global warming. |近义词：refrigerants, propellants |反义词：CFCs (in terms of ozone depletion)


USAGE->

一般现在时:
HFCs are used in many refrigeration systems. = 氢氟烃被广泛应用于许多制冷系统。
The company produces a range of HFC refrigerants. = 这家公司生产各种氢氟烃制冷剂。


一般过去时:
Scientists discovered the greenhouse effect of HFCs. = 科学家们发现了氢氟烃的温室效应。
The industry phased out many CFCs and HCFCs in favor of HFCs. = 行业淘汰了许多氯氟烃和氢氯氟烃，转而使用氢氟烃。


现在完成时:
Regulations have limited the production of HFCs in some countries. = 一些国家已经对氢氟烃的生产进行了限制。
The scientific community has studied the environmental impact of HFCs extensively. = 科学界已经广泛研究了氢氟烃的环境影响。


过去完成时:
Before the Montreal Protocol, HFCs were not widely used. = 在蒙特利尔议定书之前，氢氟烃并未被广泛使用。
Scientists had already identified HFCs as potent greenhouse gases by the late 20th century. = 到20世纪末，科学家们已经将氢氟烃确定为强效温室气体。


将来时:
New regulations will further restrict the use of HFCs. = 新的法规将进一步限制氢氟烃的使用。
The industry will need to find alternative refrigerants to replace HFCs. = 该行业需要找到替代氢氟烃的制冷剂。


虚拟语气:
If we had acted sooner, we could have reduced the impact of HFCs. = 如果我们早点采取行动，就能减少氢氟烃的影响。
It is vital that we transition away from HFCs as soon as possible. = 我们必须尽快摆脱氢氟烃。


被动语态:
HFCs are being phased out gradually in many regions. = 在许多地区，氢氟烃正在逐步淘汰。
The environmental effects of HFCs are being closely monitored. = 氢氟烃的环境影响正在受到密切监测。


疑问句:
What are the alternatives to HFCs? = 氢氟烃的替代品是什么？
How effective are current regulations on HFCs? = 目前关于氢氟烃的法规有多有效？


否定句:
HFCs are not ozone-depleting substances. = 氢氟烃不是消耗臭氧层物质。
The use of HFCs is not sustainable in the long term. = 长期来看，氢氟烃的使用不可持续。


PHRASE->

HFC refrigerant = 氢氟烃制冷剂
HFC emission = 氢氟烃排放
HFC regulation = 氢氟烃法规
HFC phase-out = 氢氟烃淘汰
HFC alternatives = 氢氟烃替代品
