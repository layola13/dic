The oak's acorns are contained within indehiscent cups. 橡树的橡子包含在不开裂的壳斗中。|近义词：closed, sealed, unopening|反义词：dehiscent

词源:
The word "indehiscent" is derived from the Latin prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and "dehiscent" (meaning "opening," "splitting").  "Dehiscent" itself comes from the Latin verb "dehiscēre," meaning "to gape open," "to split open." Therefore, indehiscent literally means "not opening."
