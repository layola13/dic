词源:

The word "overdated" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "beyond" or "exceeding") and the adjective "dated" (meaning "bearing a date").  "Dated" itself derives from the noun "date," which ultimately traces back to the Old French word "date" and the Latin word "dātum," meaning "something given" or "a thing given."  In this context, "date" refers to the time something was produced or became valid, making "overdated" signify exceeding that time limit.
