The word "cammas" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a technical term:  It might be jargon specific to a particular field (e.g., science, engineering, etc.). If so, please provide the context in which you encountered the word.
* It's a proper noun: It could be a name (of a person, place, or thing).  Again, context is crucial.
* It's a newly coined word or slang:  New words are constantly emerging, but without more information, it's impossible to analyze.


Please provide more information so I can assist you accurately.
