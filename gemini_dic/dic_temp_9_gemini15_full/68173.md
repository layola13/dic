词源:
The word derives from "faint" (meaning weak or lacking strength) + "hearted" (referring to the heart, often associated with courage and spirit) + "-ness" (a suffix forming nouns of state or quality).  Therefore, faint-heartedness literally means the state of having a weak heart in terms of courage.
