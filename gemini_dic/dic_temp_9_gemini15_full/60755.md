electrogenic:/ˌɛləktrəˈdʒɛnɪk/| adj.| 生电的，产生电流的 |Producing or generating an electric current.  The term describes processes that create a voltage difference across a membrane. |例句：The sodium-potassium pump is an electrogenic pump because it generates a membrane potential.  钠钾泵是一个生电泵，因为它会产生膜电位。


The electrogenic activity of the heart is crucial for coordinated contractions. 心脏的生电活动对于协调收缩至关重要。|近义词：current-generating, voltage-producing |反义词：electrolytic


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The sodium-potassium pump is electrogenic. = 钠钾泵是生电的。
This process is electrogenic in nature. = 这个过程本质上是生电的。

一般过去时:
The experiment demonstrated that the process was electrogenic. = 实验表明该过程是生电的。
The researchers found that the ion channel was electrogenic. = 研究人员发现该离子通道是生电的。

现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered many electrogenic mechanisms. = 科学家们已经发现了许多生电机制。
Researchers have shown that this protein is electrogenic. = 研究人员已经证明这种蛋白质是生电的。

过去完成时:
They had already known that the system was electrogenic before the experiment. = 他们在实验之前就已经知道该系统是生电的了。
It had been established that the pump was electrogenic. = 已经确定该泵是生电的。

将来时:
Future research will investigate other electrogenic processes. = 未来的研究将调查其他生电过程。
We will explore the electrogenic properties of this new molecule. = 我们将探索这种新分子的生电特性。

虚拟语气:
If the pump were electrogenic, we would observe a potential difference. = 如果泵是生电的，我们会观察到电位差。
It would be helpful if we knew more about electrogenic mechanisms. = 如果我们对生电机制了解更多，将会有所帮助。

被动语态:

The electrogenic properties of the ion channel were investigated. = 离子通道的生电特性被研究了。

疑问句:
Is this transport mechanism electrogenic? = 这种转运机制是生电的吗？
Are all ion channels electrogenic? = 所有离子通道都是生电的吗？

否定句:
This transport process is not electrogenic. = 这种运输过程不是生电的。
The passive transport of ions is not electrogenic. = 离子的被动运输不是生电的。


PHRASE->
electrogenic pump 生电泵
electrogenic potential 生电电位
electrogenic activity 生电活性
electrogenic transport 生电转运
electrogenic properties 生电特性

词源:
electrogenic comes from "electro-" (electricity) + "-genic" (producing, generating).  It literally means "electricity-producing".
