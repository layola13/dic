词源:
The word "jostle" comes from the Middle French word *jostler*, meaning "to joust," which in turn ultimately comes from the Old French *joster* (to joust, to just).  The connection lies in the physical pushing and shoving that often accompanies jousting, and the similar forceful movements involved in jostling.
