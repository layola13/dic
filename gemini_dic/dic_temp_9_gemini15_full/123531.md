The term refers to the reproductive system of monotremes, which lay eggs instead of giving birth to live young.  |Example: The echidna is a monotrematous mammal.  针鼹是一种单孔类哺乳动物。|近义词：oviparous (in the context of mammals)|反义词：viviparous (in the context of mammals)|


Etymology:

The word "monotrematous" is derived from the Greek words:

* **mono- (μονο-)**: meaning "one," "single," or "alone."
* **trema (τρῆμα)**: meaning "hole," "opening," or "perforation."
* **-ous**: a suffix forming adjectives, meaning "full of," "having," or "characterized by."

Therefore, "monotrematous" literally means "having a single opening," referring to the cloaca, a single opening for the urinary, reproductive, and digestive tracts found in monotremes.
