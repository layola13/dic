preliberated: /ˌpriːˈlɪbəreɪtɪd/ | adj. | 预先解放的；预先释放的 |  A preliberated state refers to a condition where something has been freed or released beforehand.  The term suggests a proactive or anticipatory act of liberation.  It is a relatively uncommon word, often used in specific contexts relating to political or social movements or philosophical discussions about freedom. There are no direct synonyms, as the word itself is quite specific. Antonyms would include words suggesting oppression, confinement or enslavement. |
