Etymology:

The word "mainstays" is a plural noun derived from the word "mainstay."  "Main" comes from Old English *mægen, meaning "strength, might, power," and "stay" comes from Old Norse *steiðr, meaning "post, prop, support."  Therefore, a mainstay is literally something that provides strength and support. The "-s" indicates plurality.
