词源:
The word "sabotage" originates from the French word "sabot," meaning "wooden shoe."  In the 18th and 19th centuries, French workers would sometimes throw their sabots (wooden shoes) into machinery to disrupt production as a form of protest. This action evolved into the broader meaning of deliberate destruction or obstruction of work.  The word entered English in the early 20th century.
