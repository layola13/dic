resistors:/rɪˈzɪstərz/| n. |电阻器，阻抗元件 |A resistor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that implements electrical resistance as a circuit element.  Resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels, divide voltages, bias active elements, and terminate transmission lines, among other uses. | The circuit board contains several resistors of different values.  这个电路板包含几个不同值的电阻器。


The amplifier uses a 10k ohm resistor to set the gain.  放大器使用一个10k欧姆的电阻器来设置增益。|  resistances,impedances | conductors | n.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The resistor limits the current flow. = 电阻器限制电流。
These resistors control the voltage. = 这些电阻器控制电压。


一般过去时:
The resistor failed after overheating. = 电阻器过热后失效了。
We replaced the faulty resistor. = 我们更换了有故障的电阻器。


现在完成时:
Engineers have tested the new resistors. = 工程师们已经测试了新的电阻器。
They have installed high-resistance resistors. = 他们已经安装了高阻值的电阻器。


过去完成时:
The circuit malfunctioned because a resistor had burned out. = 电路发生故障是因为一个电阻器烧坏了。
Before the test, they had checked all the resistors. = 测试之前，他们已经检查了所有的电阻器。


将来时:
We will install new resistors tomorrow. = 我们明天将安装新的电阻器。
The technician will replace the damaged resistors. = 技术员将更换损坏的电阻器。


虚拟语气:
If we used a higher-value resistor, the current would be lower. = 如果我们使用一个更高值的电阻器，电流就会更低。
It would be better if we had chosen more robust resistors. = 如果我们选择更耐用的电阻器就好了。


被动语态:
The resistors are being tested for quality. = 这些电阻器正在进行质量测试。
The circuit was damaged because the resistors were overloaded. = 电路损坏是因为电阻器过载了。


疑问句:
What type of resistors are needed for this project? = 这个项目需要什么类型的电阻器？
How many resistors are there in the circuit? = 电路中有多少个电阻器？


否定句:
This circuit doesn't contain any resistors. = 这个电路不包含任何电阻器。
The resistors didn't cause the problem. = 电阻器并没有导致问题。


PHRASE->
power resistor = 功率电阻器
variable resistor = 可变电阻器
current-limiting resistor = 限流电阻器
shunt resistor = 分流电阻器
resistor network = 电阻网络
