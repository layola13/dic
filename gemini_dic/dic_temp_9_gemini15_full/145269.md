词源:
The word "overbook" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "book" (meaning to reserve or arrange for something in advance).  It emerged as a natural extension of the existing vocabulary related to reservations and bookings, reflecting the increasingly common practice of exceeding capacity in various industries.
