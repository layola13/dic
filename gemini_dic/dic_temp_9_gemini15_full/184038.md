词源:

The word "residentiality" is derived from the word "residential," which in turn comes from the Latin word "residere," meaning "to sit," "to dwell," or "to remain."  The suffix "-ial" transforms the verb into an adjective ("residential"), meaning relating to residence or dwelling. The further addition of the suffix "-ity" transforms the adjective into a noun ("residentiality"), signifying the state or quality of being residential.
