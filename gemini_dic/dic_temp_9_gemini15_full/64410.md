ergativity:/ˌɜːrɡəˈtɪvɪti/| n. |施事性；能动性；[语] 施事句法|Ergativity refers to a grammatical system where the subject of a transitive verb (the one performing the action) behaves differently from the subject of an intransitive verb (the one undergoing the action).  In ergative languages, the subject of a transitive verb is marked differently than the subject of an intransitive verb, often with a special case marking called the ergative case. This contrasts with nominative-accusative systems, where the subject of both transitive and intransitive verbs receives the same case marking (nominative).|Example:  In an ergative language, the sentence "The dog bit the man" might mark "dog" differently than the "man" in "The man fell."  In a nominative-accusative language, both "dog" and "man" would receive the same marking in their respective sentences.|近义词：transitivity (in the sense of grammatical relation)|反义词：nominative-accusative system|
