词源:
The word "documented" comes from the noun "document," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "document," meaning "something that provides evidence."  The Old French word itself comes from the Latin word "documentum," meaning "lesson, example, instruction," which is ultimately related to the verb "docēre," meaning "to teach."
