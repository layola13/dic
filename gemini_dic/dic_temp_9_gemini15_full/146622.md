词源:  The word "overhandicapping" is a relatively modern coinage, a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively) and "handicapping" (giving an advantage to someone considered less skilled or disadvantaged).  The root of "handicap" comes from the Old English "hand i cap," referring to a game where a player is given a head start.  The modern sense of disadvantage or disability evolved later.
