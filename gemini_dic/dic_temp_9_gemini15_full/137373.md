词源:
The word "nontemperate" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "temperate."  "Temperate" ultimately derives from the Latin word "temperatus," the past participle of "temperare," meaning "to moderate, temper, regulate."  Therefore, "nontemperate" signifies the opposite of being moderate, mild, or regulated.
