hypermutabilities:/ˌhaɪpərmjuːtəˈbɪlətiz/| n. |超变异性；高度突变性 |The term "hypermutabilities" refers to the phenomenon of unusually high rates of mutation in specific regions of the genome or in certain genes. This can be caused by various factors, including errors in DNA replication, the action of mutagenic agents, or the presence of specific DNA sequences that are prone to mutation.  Hypermutabilities play a significant role in processes like antibody diversification in the immune system and the evolution of viruses. |Example:  The study examined the hypermutabilities observed in the viral genome during the pandemic. 这项研究检查了疫情期间病毒基因组中观察到的超变异性。|近义词：high mutation rates, elevated mutability|反义词：genetic stability


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in a scientific context, specifically within the fields of genetics, immunology, and virology.  Therefore, typical grammatical examples using common tenses are less relevant. Instead, here are examples showcasing its usage in scientific writing:


Present Simple:  This gene exhibits hypermutabilities in its promoter region. 这个基因在其启动子区域表现出超变异性。

Present Perfect: Researchers have identified several factors contributing to these hypermutabilities. 研究人员已经确定了导致这些超变异性的几个因素。

Past Simple: The study demonstrated significant hypermutabilities within the antibody genes. 这项研究证明了抗体基因内的显著超变异性。


Past Perfect: Previous research had suggested a link between these hypermutabilities and increased virulence. 先前的研究表明这些超变异性和毒力增加之间存在联系。


Future Simple: Future studies will investigate the mechanisms underlying these observed hypermutabilities. 未来的研究将调查这些观察到的超变异性的潜在机制。
