The word "intermessages" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word, or a misspelling.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need clarification:

1. **Is this a misspelling?**  If so, what was the intended word?  Knowing the intended word would allow for a proper analysis.

2. **Is this a technical term or neologism?** If it's a technical term used within a specific field, please provide context (e.g., the field of study, a document where you encountered it).

3. **Is this a deliberate coinage?** If you created this word, please explain its intended meaning and usage.


Once you provide this information, I can offer a more precise analysis.
