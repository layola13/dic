Etymology:

The word "skirmisher" is derived from the verb "skirmish," which comes from the Middle Dutch word "schermersche," meaning "a fencing match" or "a fight."  The "-er" suffix is an agent noun suffix, indicating a person who performs the action.  Thus, a skirmisher is someone who engages in skirmishes. The ultimate origin is likely from the Old French word "escrime," meaning "fencing."
