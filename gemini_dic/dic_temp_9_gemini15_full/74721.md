This word is not a standard English word.  It appears to be an incorrect pluralization of "freeness," which itself is a noun.  The possessive 's is inappropriately added.  Proper usage would involve using "freeness" as a singular noun or "freedoms" as a plural noun depending on the context.


Therefore, providing grammatical examples in different tenses, voices, etc., as requested in the original format, is not possible for "freeness's" as it's grammatically flawed.  The word should be corrected to either "freeness" or "freedoms".
