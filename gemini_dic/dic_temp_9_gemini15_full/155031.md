词源:  From the Old French word "petit," meaning "small."  It ultimately derives from the Latin word "petītus," the past participle of "petere," meaning "to seek" or "to strive for."  While the connection might seem tenuous, the sense of something being "sought after" or "desired" due to its smallness and delicacy could be a contributing factor to the evolution of meaning.
