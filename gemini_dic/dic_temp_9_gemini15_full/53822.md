词源:

The word "disconnecting" is formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart" or "away") to the verb "connecting."  "Connect" originates from the Old French word "connecter," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "con-nectere," meaning "to bind together."  Therefore, "disconnecting" literally means "to unbind" or "to separate from a connection."
