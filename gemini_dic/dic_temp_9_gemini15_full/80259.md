词源:

The word is a compound of "goggle" (to stare with wide eyes) and "-eyed" (having eyes of a certain type).  "Goggle" itself likely originates from the Middle English word "gogle," which meant to roll or stare with the eyes.  This further relates to the Old Norse word "gogl," referring to something round and prominent, like an eye.
