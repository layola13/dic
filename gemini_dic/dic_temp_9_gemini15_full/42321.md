词源:

The word "counter-revolutionary" is a compound word.  "Counter-" is a prefix meaning "against" or "opposite," derived from the Old French "contre" (against). "Revolutionary" comes from "revolution," ultimately from the Latin "revolutio," meaning "a turning around."  Thus, "counter-revolutionary" literally means "against a revolution."
