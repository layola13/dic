This word has a complex history and usage.  It is derived from the name of the Niger River and subsequently the countries Niger and Nigeria.  While it can be used to refer to people from these countries, its use as a racial slur targeting Black people is overwhelmingly prevalent and deeply offensive.  Therefore, its use should be avoided entirely unless discussing its etymology or historical context.  Even then, extreme caution and sensitivity are required.

The offensive use of "niger" is rooted in racist historical contexts, associating blackness with negativity and inferiority. This meaning overshadows any neutral geographic usage.  It carries a weight of historical oppression and is considered hate speech.

Because of its highly offensive nature, providing examples of its usage as a racial slur would be irresponsible and harmful.  The word should never be used in this context.
