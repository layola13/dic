USAGE->
This word is uncommon and doesn't typically follow standard verb conjugation patterns like the example word "what".  It functions primarily as a noun.

Example 1:  The study classified all known existers into various categories based on their characteristics. 这项研究根据其特征将所有已知存在者分类为不同的类别。

Example 2:  Some believe that existers beyond our comprehension inhabit other dimensions. 一些人认为我们无法理解的存在者居住在其他维度。
