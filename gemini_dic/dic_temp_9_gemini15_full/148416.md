/ˌoʊvərˈstædˌfæst.nəsɪz/ | n. | 过度坚定；顽固不化 |  The word "oversteadfastnesses" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a neologism, formed by combining "oversteadfast" (itself a non-standard word implying excessive steadfastness) with the suffix "-nesses," which typically indicates a plural of qualities or states.  Therefore, it suggests multiple instances of excessive steadfastness or stubbornness.  There is no established meaning or usage in dictionaries or corpora.  Because it's not a real word, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical usage is impossible.  A proper analysis requires a valid word.
