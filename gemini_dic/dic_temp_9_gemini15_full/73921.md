词源:
The word "forsworn" comes from the Old English "forsworen," which is a past participle of the verb "forswear."  "For-" is an intensive prefix meaning "completely" or "utterly," and "swear" refers to making a solemn promise or oath. Therefore, "forsworn" literally means "completely sworn," but in its modern usage, it carries the connotation of breaking that oath or promise.
