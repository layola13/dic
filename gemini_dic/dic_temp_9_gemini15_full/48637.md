词源:

The word "defenderism" is a relatively modern coinage. It is derived from the noun "defender" (one who defends) and the suffix "-ism," which typically denotes a doctrine, system, or ideology.  The "-ism" suffix transforms the noun "defender" into a term signifying a particular attitude, belief system, or practice centered around defense or protection.
