词源:
The word "paltry" ultimately derives from the Old French word "paltrie," meaning "rags," "rubbish," or "trash."  This, in turn, is likely related to the Old French word "paltre," meaning "worthless fellow."  The sense shifted over time from referring to worthless things to describing things as insignificant or meager in quantity or value.
