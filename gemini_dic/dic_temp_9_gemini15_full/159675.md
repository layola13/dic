polyadelphous: /ˌpɒliˈædəlfəs/ | adj. | 多体雄蕊的 |

英文解析:  Referring to flowers in which the stamens are united into more than two bundles.  This is a botanical term describing the arrangement of stamens (the male reproductive organ in a flower).  In a polyadelphous flower, the filaments (the stalk-like part of the stamen) are fused together into several distinct bundles or groups.

例句:
The citrus flower exhibits a polyadelphous stamen arrangement. = 柑橘花表现出多体雄蕊的排列方式。

The hibiscus flower shows a polyadelphous condition. = 木槿花显示出多体雄蕊的特征。


近义词:  There isn't a direct synonym, as polyadelphous describes a specific floral characteristic.  Terms like "monadelphous" (stamens united into a single bundle) and "diadelphous" (stamens united into two bundles) describe related but distinct arrangements.

反义词:  The antonyms would be terms describing stamens that are not united, such as "free" or "separate."
