词源:

The word "rightless" is a straightforward combination of "right" and the suffix "-less," which indicates absence or lack of something.  "Right" in this context refers to a moral or legal entitlement.  The word's etymology traces back to Old English "riht," meaning "just, correct, straight," related to the Proto-Germanic *rextō and ultimately to the Proto-Indo-European root *reg- "to rule, to lead straight."  The "-less" suffix has Germanic origins as well.


用法说明:

Rightless is primarily used as an adjective to describe individuals or groups who lack certain fundamental rights or legal protections.  It emphasizes a state of vulnerability and lack of agency.  The word carries a strong connotation of injustice and often appears in contexts discussing social inequalities, human rights abuses, or legal deficiencies.
