词源:
The word "deluder" is derived from the verb "delude," which comes from the Latin word "ludere," meaning "to play" or "to deceive."  The prefix "de-" adds a sense of "away from" or "down," implying a misleading or deceptive action.  Thus, "delude" means to mislead or deceive, and "deluder" is the agent of that action.
