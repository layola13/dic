polypide:/ˈpɒlɪpaɪd/| n. |水螅体；个体水螅|A polypide is an individual zooid in a colonial organism, such as a bryozoan or a pterobranch.  It typically consists of a polyp (a tubular body with tentacles) and its associated structures.  |Example: The bryozoan colony was composed of numerous interconnected polypides.  该苔藓虫群体由许多相互连接的水螅体组成。|近义词：zooid (individual organism in a colony)|反义词：colony (the entire group)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The polypide feeds on plankton. = 水螅体以浮游生物为食。
Each polypide contributes to the colony's growth. = 每个水螅体都促进群体的生长。

一般过去时:
The researcher observed the polypide's feeding behavior. = 研究人员观察了水螅体的摄食行为。
The damaged polypide was quickly replaced. = 受损的水螅体很快就被替换了。

现在完成时:
Scientists have studied polypide development extensively. = 科学家们已经广泛研究了水螅体的发育。
The colony has lost several polypides due to disease. = 由于疾病，群体已经损失了几个水螅体。

过去完成时:
Before the observation, the polypide had retracted its tentacles. = 在观察之前，水螅体已经收回了触手。
The colony had already lost many polypides by the time the treatment began. = 当治疗开始时，群体已经损失了许多水螅体。

将来时:
The researchers will analyze the polypide's genetic material. = 研究人员将分析水螅体的遗传物质。
We will observe how the polypide responds to environmental changes. = 我们将观察水螅体如何应对环境变化。

虚拟语气:
If the polypide were damaged, the colony would be weakened. = 如果水螅体受损，群体就会变弱。
I wish I could observe the polypide more closely. = 我希望我能更仔细地观察水螅体。

被动语态:
The polypide's structure was carefully examined under a microscope. = 水螅体的结构在显微镜下被仔细检查。

否定句:
The polypide did not show any signs of disease. = 水螅体没有显示任何疾病迹象。
This species does not have a specialized polypide for reproduction. = 这个物种没有专门用于繁殖的水螅体。
