词源:
The word "piggy bank" is a compound word.  "Piggy" is a diminutive of "pig," referring to the animal's shape often used for the container. "Bank" refers to a place of storage, particularly for money. The origin of using a pig-shaped container for saving money is not definitively known, but theories suggest it may be related to the use of clay pots in medieval times, which were sometimes decorated with pig figures.  The specific evolution of this form to its modern meaning is unclear, but its widespread use suggests a long and interesting history.
