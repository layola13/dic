ferromagnets:/ˌfɛroʊˈmæɡnɛts/| n. |铁磁体|Materials that exhibit strong magnetic properties due to the alignment of their atomic magnetic moments.  They retain their magnetism even after the external magnetic field is removed.  This is due to the strong interaction between the magnetic moments of neighboring atoms. |Example: Iron, nickel, and cobalt are examples of ferromagnets.  铁、镍和钴是铁磁体的例子。|近义词:ferrimagnets (in some contexts)|反义词:diamagnets, paramagnets
