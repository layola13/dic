词源:
From Middle English *malignant, from Old French *malignant, from Latin malignāns, present participle of malignāre "to slander, speak evil of," from malus "bad" + -gnāre (suffix forming verbs of expressing).  The sense evolved from "evil-speaking" to "evil-intentioned" and then to "harmful, dangerous".
