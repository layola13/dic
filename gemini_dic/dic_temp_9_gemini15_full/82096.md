词源:
The word "groc" is a clipped form of "grocery," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "gros," meaning "large, bulky."  This refers to the large quantities of goods sold in grocery stores.  The "-ery" suffix denotes a place or collection of things.  Thus, "grocery" originally signified a store selling large quantities of goods, evolving to specifically denote food and household supplies.  The shortening to "groc" is a result of informal speech patterns, reducing the word for ease of use.
