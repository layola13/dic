halfcock: /ˈhæfˌkɒk/ | adj. | 半拉的；（枪支）未完全上膛的；不充分的；草率的 |

英文解析:  Describes something that is incomplete, improperly prepared, or only partially done.  In the context of firearms, it specifically refers to a firearm that is not fully cocked, leaving it in a potentially unsafe and unreliable state.  Figuratively, it can describe a plan or action that is rushed, ill-considered, or inadequately prepared.

词性: adjective


词源:  The word originates from the literal meaning in firearm handling.  "Cock" in this context refers to the act of cocking a firearm (preparing it to fire), and "half-cocked" describes a state where this process is only partially completed.  The figurative extension of the word's meaning developed naturally from this literal usage.  The term's usage has evolved over time, with the literal meaning relating to firearms still present but the more common usage today being the figurative meaning of something incomplete or poorly prepared.
