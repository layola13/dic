词源:
The word "enrolled" comes from the Old French word "enroller," meaning "to enroll" or "to register."  "En-" is a prefix meaning "in" or "into," and "-roll" comes from the Old French "rolle," meaning "roll" (as in a roll of parchment where names were recorded).  Thus, the original meaning was literally "to write someone's name into a roll."
