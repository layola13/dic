词源：The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "apologetic" (expressing regret or remorse).  "Apologetic" originates from the Greek word "apologetikos," meaning "defending," "making excuses."  The evolution reflects a shift in meaning, from simply defending oneself to expressing regret.
