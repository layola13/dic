corrosion:/kəˈroʊʒən/| n. |腐蚀，侵蚀 |The deterioration of a material, usually a metal, caused by a chemical reaction with its environment.  This often involves oxidation, but can also be caused by other chemical or electrochemical processes.  |例句：The corrosion of the iron pipes led to a major water leak.  铁管腐蚀导致了严重的漏水事故。

The corrosion on the ship's hull was extensive. 船体上的腐蚀非常严重。


近义词：erosion, deterioration, decay, rusting |反义词：preservation, protection


词源:  From Old French *corrosioun, from Latin *corrosio, from corrodere "to gnaw," from com- "together" + rodere "to gnaw."
