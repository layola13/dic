词源:
The word "periwig" comes from the Middle French word "perruque," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "pilus" meaning "hair."  The French word evolved through various stages, with the English adoption incorporating the "peri-" prefix, possibly influenced by the similar-sounding Greek prefix "peri-" meaning "around" or "about," although this is debated.  The "wig" part is a shortening of the word itself.
