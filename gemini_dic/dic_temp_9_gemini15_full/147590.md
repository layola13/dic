词源：

The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or too much) and "piteousness," which derives from "piteous," meaning deserving or causing pity.  "Piteous" itself comes from the Old French "piteux," ultimately from the Latin "pietas," meaning piety, dutifulness, or devotion.  While "pietas" originally had a broader meaning, its association with compassion and sorrow developed over time.  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "piteous" into a noun, indicating a state or quality.
