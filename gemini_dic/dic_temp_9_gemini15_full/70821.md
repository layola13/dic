词源：The word "finicky" itself has an uncertain etymology, but it's likely a blend or alteration of words associated with  "finical," meaning "overly concerned with trivialities," which in turn derives from "finicalness".  The "-ier" suffix indicates the comparative form, showing a higher degree of finickiness.  The connection to "fine" (meaning delicate or refined) might also play a subtle role, suggesting a connection between refined tastes and excessive particularity.
