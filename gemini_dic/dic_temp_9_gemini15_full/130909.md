词源:

The word "nonascendancy" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "ascendancy" (meaning "dominance" or "superiority").  "Ascendancy" itself comes from the verb "ascend," meaning "to rise" or "to climb," ultimately derived from Latin "ascendere" (to climb up).  Therefore, "nonascendancy" literally means "not rising to dominance" or "lack of dominance."
