词源:

The word "excommunicators" is derived from the verb "excommunicate," which itself comes from the Late Latin word "excommunicatus," a past participle meaning "excommunicated."  This in turn is composed of the prefix "ex-" (out, from), "communicare" (to share, to communicate), and the past participle suffix "-atus."  The core meaning revolves around removing someone from the shared communion or fellowship of a religious community.
