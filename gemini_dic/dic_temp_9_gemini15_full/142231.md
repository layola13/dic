orogenic:/ˌɔːrəˈdʒɛnɪk/ | adj. | 造山的；成山的 | Relating to the process of mountain building.  Orogenic processes involve the deformation and uplift of the Earth's crust, resulting in the formation of mountain ranges.  | 例句：The Himalayas are a prime example of orogenic activity. 喜马拉雅山是造山活动的主要例子。  The orogenic belt stretches across several continents.  造山带横跨几个大陆。 | 近义词：mountain-building, tectonical | 反义词：planatory (referring to flat land formation) | 词性：形容词
