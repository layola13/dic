lungfish:/ˈlʌŋfɪʃ/| n. |肺鱼|A lungfish is a type of fish that can breathe air using lungs, in addition to gills. They are known for their ability to survive in harsh conditions, such as drought, by burrowing into mud and entering a state of estivation.  They are considered living fossils, with a lineage dating back millions of years. | Example: The Australian lungfish is one of the most primitive living vertebrates.  澳大利亚肺鱼是最原始的活体脊椎动物之一。  The lungfish's ability to breathe air allows it to survive in oxygen-poor waters. 肺鱼能够呼吸空气，这使得它能够在缺氧的水域中生存。|近义词： (no direct synonyms, but could be grouped with other air-breathing fish)|反义词：(no direct antonyms)|名词
