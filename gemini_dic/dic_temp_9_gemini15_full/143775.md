词源:The word "outmoded" comes from the combination of "out-" (meaning "no longer," "outside of," or "beyond") and "moded" (past participle of "mode," meaning "fashion" or "style").  The "mode" element ultimately derives from Old French *mode and Latin *modus, meaning "measure," "manner," or "method."  Therefore, "outmoded" literally means "no longer in fashion" or "beyond the current style."
