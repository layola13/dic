词源:

The word "self-servingly" is derived from the adjective "self-serving," which is a compound word formed from "self" and "serving."  "Self" refers to oneself, and "serving" means acting in the interest of.  The adverbial suffix "-ingly" is added to create the adverbial form, indicating the manner or way in which the action is performed.  The root of "serving" ultimately traces back to the Old English word "servian," meaning "to serve."
