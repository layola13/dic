isospondyli:/ˌaɪsoʊˈspɒndɪlaɪ/| n. |等椎动物|Isospondyli refers to a group of extinct marine reptiles characterized by their uniformly shaped vertebrae.  These reptiles are primarily known from fossils found in various parts of the world and are believed to have lived during the Mesozoic Era.  Further research is needed to fully understand their evolutionary relationships and ecological roles. |例句：The discovery of new isospondyli fossils in the region sheds light on the diversity of marine reptiles during the Triassic period. 等椎动物化石在该地区的新发现揭示了三叠纪时期海洋爬行动物的多样性。|近义词：暂无直接近义词，可根据语境用更广义的词如marine reptile替换|反义词：暂无直接反义词|名词
