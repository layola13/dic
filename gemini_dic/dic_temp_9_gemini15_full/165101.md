There is no verb or noun form of "preimposing" in standard English dictionaries. The word is an adjective formed by combining "pre-" (before, in advance) and "imposing" (making a strong impression; impressive). However, the combination is not a standard or widely accepted word; its use is highly uncommon and possibly a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, providing grammatical usage examples (as requested in the format) is not meaningful because the word itself lacks widespread usage and acceptance.  The definition provided is based on a logical interpretation of its constituent parts.
