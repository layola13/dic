词源:
The word "raincoat" is a compound word, combining "rain" (referring to precipitation) and "coat" (a type of outer garment).  Its origins trace back to the 19th century, coinciding with the development of waterproof fabrics and the increased need for protective outerwear during inclement weather.  The exact etymology is difficult to pinpoint to a single source, but its formation reflects a straightforward and logical combination of existing words to describe a specific item of clothing.
