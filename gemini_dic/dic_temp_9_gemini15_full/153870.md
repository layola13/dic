perchromic: /pɜːrkroʊmɪk/ | adj. | 过铬酸的，高铬酸的 | Relating to or denoting compounds containing a higher oxidation state of chromium than chromates.  These compounds are typically deep blue or purple in color and are often unstable.  They are formed by the reaction of chromates or dichromates with strong oxidizing agents like hydrogen peroxide. | The perchromic acid formed a deep blue solution. 过铬酸形成了深蓝色溶液。|近义词:  (lacks direct synonyms, needs contextual alternatives)|反义词: (lacks direct antonyms, depends on context)|词性:形容词

词源:
The word "perchromic" is derived from "per-" (meaning "beyond" or "above," indicating a higher oxidation state) and "chromic" (relating to chromium).  Thus, it refers to chromium compounds with a higher oxidation state than usually found in chromates or dichromates.
