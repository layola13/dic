词源:
The word "headfish" is a relatively informal and modern term. Its etymology is unclear, but it likely combines "head," suggesting a lack of intelligence or sense, with "fish," possibly implying a lack of awareness or being easily caught.  The combination creates an image of someone being dense or unthinking.
