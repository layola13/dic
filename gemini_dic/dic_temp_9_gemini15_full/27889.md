cantalever:/ˈkæntɪˌliːvər/| n.|悬臂，悬臂梁|A cantilever is a rigid structural element, such as a beam, that extends horizontally from a single support point.  It is designed to withstand loads primarily through bending, with the support point typically located at one end. |The bridge was built using a series of cantilevered beams. 这座桥是用一系列悬臂梁建造的。 The balcony is a cantilever structure extending from the wall.  阳台是一个从墙上延伸出的悬臂结构。|bracket, overhang|column, support|名词
