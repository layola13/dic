quasi-elementary:/ˈkwɑːziˌɛləˈmɛntəri/ | adj. |准基本的；近似于基本的 |  Relating to or resembling something elementary, but not entirely or perfectly so;  approaching but not fully achieving the simplicity or basic nature of something elementary.  It suggests a level of complexity slightly beyond truly elementary concepts or methods. |The quasi-elementary proof was elegant but lacked complete rigor. = 这个准基本的证明很优雅，但缺乏完全的严谨性。 The quasi-elementary particles are not as simple as the standard model suggests. = 准基本粒子并不像标准模型所暗示的那样简单。 | near-elementary, rudimentary | complex, advanced |  形容词

词源:
The word is a combination of "quasi," meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent," and "elementary," meaning "basic" or "fundamental."  Therefore, "quasi-elementary" describes something that resembles something basic but isn't quite so.
