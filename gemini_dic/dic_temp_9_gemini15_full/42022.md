词源:  Comes from the word "costive," meaning "constipated," which in turn is derived from the Old French "costif," meaning "costly, expensive."  The connection lies in the idea that constipation was considered a costly or difficult condition to endure.  The "-ness" suffix adds the meaning of "state or condition."
