USAGE->
This word is exceptionally rare and doesn't lend itself to typical grammatical examples in the way common words do.  Its usage is primarily limited to academic or highly specialized writing where the nuance of a lack of festive atmosphere is crucial.  Therefore, providing examples across all tenses and moods is impractical and artificial.


EXAMPLE SENTENCES:

The author emphasized the palpable nonfestivenesses contrasting sharply with the vibrant celebrations depicted in earlier chapters. = 作者强调了明显的非喜庆气氛，这与前面章节中描绘的热闹庆祝活动形成鲜明对比。



PHRASE->
This word is not typically used in phrases. Its highly specialized nature limits its combinatory potential.  Attempts to force it into common phrases would result in unnatural and awkward constructions.
