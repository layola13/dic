词源:  The word "interactions" comes from the verb "interact," which is a combination of the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and the verb "act" (meaning "to do" or "to perform").  Therefore, "interact" literally means "to act between" or "to act among." Adding the suffix "-ions" forms the noun "interactions," referring to the instances or processes of interacting.
