The word "oxiodic" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you intended a different word.  If you can provide the context in which you encountered this word, it might be possible to guess the intended word and provide the requested information.
* **A neologism (newly coined word):**  If it's a newly invented word, there is no existing information available.
* **A technical term:** It might be a term specific to a particular field (science, medicine, etc.).  Again, providing context is crucial.


To get a proper analysis, please double-check the spelling or provide more context surrounding the word's usage.
