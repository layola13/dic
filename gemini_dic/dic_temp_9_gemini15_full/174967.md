词源:
The word "radicalises" comes from the adjective "radical," ultimately derived from the Latin word "radix," meaning "root."  The sense of "fundamental" or "going to the root of something" evolved, leading to the meaning of "extreme" or "revolutionary" in political and social contexts. The verb form "-ise" (or "-ize" in American English) indicates the process of making something radical.
