gelation:/ˌdʒɛləˈeɪʃən/| n. |胶凝作用，凝胶化|The process by which a sol transforms into a gel.  This involves the formation of a three-dimensional network of interconnected polymer chains or particles within a liquid medium.  The resulting gel exhibits a solid-like structure, while still containing a significant amount of liquid.|例句：The gelation of the pectin solution resulted in a firm jelly. 果胶溶液的胶凝作用形成了坚实的果冻。

The slow gelation of the agar allowed for a smooth texture.  琼脂缓慢的胶凝作用使得质地光滑。|近义词：solidification, coagulation, jellification |反义词：liquefaction, dissolution


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The solution gels quickly at room temperature. = 溶液在室温下快速凝胶。
Gelation occurs when the polymer chains become entangled. = 当聚合物链缠结时发生胶凝作用。

一般过去时:
The mixture gelled after several hours. = 混合物几小时后凝胶。
The scientists observed the gelation process carefully. = 科学家仔细观察了胶凝过程。

现在完成时:
The mixture has gelled overnight. = 混合物一夜之间凝胶了。
The researchers have studied the factors affecting gelation. = 研究人员已经研究了影响胶凝作用的因素。

过去完成时:
The gel had already formed before the experiment began. = 实验开始前凝胶已经形成。
They had completed the gelation process before analyzing the sample. = 他们在分析样品之前已经完成了胶凝过程。

将来时:
The solution will gel within an hour. = 溶液将在一个小时内凝胶。
The scientists will monitor the gelation process closely. = 科学家将密切监测胶凝过程。

虚拟语气:
If the temperature were lower, the gelation would be slower. = 如果温度更低，胶凝作用会更慢。
I wish the gelation process were faster. = 我希望胶凝过程更快。

被动语态:
The gel was formed by cooling the mixture. = 凝胶是通过冷却混合物形成的。
The gelation process is being investigated by many scientists. = 胶凝过程正在被许多科学家研究。

疑问句:
How long does the gelation process take? = 胶凝过程需要多长时间？
What factors influence the gelation of this material? = 哪些因素影响这种材料的胶凝？

否定句:
The solution did not gel properly. = 溶液没有正确凝胶。
The experiment failed because the gelation did not occur. = 实验失败是因为没有发生胶凝作用。
