/ˌnɒnkəlæpsəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. |不可坍塌性，不可压缩性 | The inherent resistance of a structure or material to collapse or compression.  This refers to the property of something that prevents it from collapsing or being compressed.  The study of noncollapsabilities is crucial in engineering and material science to ensure structural integrity and stability. | The noncollapsabilities of the bridge's design ensured its survival during the earthquake.  桥梁设计的不可坍塌性确保其在地震中幸存。 |  indestructibility, stability, resilience | collapsibility, fragility, vulnerability | 名词
