The word "ghole" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis following your format.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's slang or jargon:**  It might be a term used within a specific community or context.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered the word), it might be possible to determine its meaning.
* **It's a newly coined word:**  While unlikely, it could be a very recent invention.

Please clarify or provide more information, and I will do my best to assist you.
