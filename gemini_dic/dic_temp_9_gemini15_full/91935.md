hypermetamorphic:/ˌhaɪpərˌmɛtəmˈɔːrfɪk/ | adj. | 超变态的；多阶段变态的 |  Describing a type of insect metamorphosis characterized by multiple distinct larval stages, each with a different morphology and lifestyle.  This differs from the typical holometabolous (complete) metamorphosis which only has four stages (egg, larva, pupa, adult). Hypermetamorphosis involves several larval instars, each with a specialized role and appearance.  | Example:  The life cycle of the blister beetle exhibits hypermetamorphic development, with its larvae undergoing dramatic changes in form and feeding habits throughout their development.  | 近义词：polymorphic (in the context of insect development) | 反义词：holometabolous (in the context of insect development) |  adj.


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly entomology (the study of insects).  Therefore, tense usage depends entirely on the surrounding sentence and its context within a scientific paper or report.  Examples below demonstrate its use in various tenses.

一般现在时:
The Strepsiptera are known for their hypermetamorphic development. = 捻翅目的发育以其超变态性而闻名。
Hypermetamorphosis often involves specialized larval stages for different ecological niches. = 超变态通常涉及为不同的生态位而特化的幼虫阶段。


一般过去时:
Researchers observed hypermetamorphic characteristics in the newly discovered species. = 研究人员在新发现的物种中观察到超变态特征。
The study documented the complex hypermetamorphic lifecycle of the beetle. = 该研究记录了该甲虫复杂的超变态生命周期。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several insect families exhibiting hypermetamorphosis. = 科学家已经确定了几种表现出超变态的昆虫科。
This research has significantly advanced our understanding of hypermetamorphic development. = 这项研究大大提高了我们对超变态发育的理解。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, little was known about this particular insect's hypermetamorphic stages. = 在发现之前，人们对这种昆虫的特定超变态阶段知之甚少。
The team had hypothesized that the species would exhibit hypermetamorphic traits before conducting the experiments. = 在进行实验之前，研究小组假设该物种会表现出超变态特征。


将来时:
Future studies will investigate the genetic basis of hypermetamorphosis. = 未来的研究将调查超变态的遗传基础。
We anticipate that further research will reveal more examples of hypermetamorphosis in insect evolution. = 我们预计进一步的研究将揭示昆虫进化中更多超变态的例子。


虚拟语气:
If the larvae were truly hypermetamorphic, they would exhibit distinct morphological changes. = 如果幼虫确实是超变态的，它们将表现出明显的形态变化。
It is hypothesized that if environmental conditions change, the hypermetamorphic process might be altered. = 假设如果环境条件发生变化，超变态过程可能会改变。


被动语态:
Hypermetamorphic development was observed in several samples. = 在几个样本中观察到超变态发育。
The differences in larval stages are believed to be driven by hypermetamorphic adaptations. = 幼虫阶段的差异被认为是由超变态适应性驱动的。


疑问句:
Is this insect's developmental strategy truly hypermetamorphic? = 这种昆虫的发育策略真的是超变态的吗？
Are there any other known examples of hypermetamorphosis in this insect order? = 在这个昆虫目中还有其他已知的超变态例子吗？


否定句:
The species did not show typical hypermetamorphic characteristics. = 该物种没有显示典型的超变态特征。
This insect's development is not considered hypermetamorphic based on current evidence. = 基于目前的证据，这种昆虫的发育不被认为是超变态的。


PHRASE->
There are few common phrases directly using "hypermetamorphic."  The usage is highly technical.  Phrases would generally describe the *process* of hypermetamorphosis rather than the word itself.  Examples focusing on related concepts:

stages of hypermetamorphosis = 超变态的阶段
hypermetamorphic larval instars = 超变态幼虫龄期
mechanism of hypermetamorphosis = 超变态机制
evolution of hypermetamorphosis = 超变态的进化
ecological significance of hypermetamorphosis = 超变态的生态意义
