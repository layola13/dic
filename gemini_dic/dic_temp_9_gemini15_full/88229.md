The word "hindis" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a word like "Hindi" (the language), "hinds" (the rear parts of an animal), or something else entirely?

2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a proper noun (like a place name or a person's name) not yet widely known or recorded in standard dictionaries.

3. **It's a newly coined word or slang:** It's possible it's a very recent addition to the lexicon, a slang term, or specific to a particular community or context.

4. **It's a non-English word:** It might be a word from another language.
