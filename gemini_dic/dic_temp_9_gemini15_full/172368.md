词源:  Derived from the verb "putter," which originally meant to move about idly or fussily, often doing small tasks without much purpose. This meaning is related to the sound of the word, suggesting a light, unfocused activity. The suffix "-ingly" transforms the verb into an adverb, modifying the manner of an action.
