词源:The word "rawboned" combines "raw," meaning "uncooked" or "unrefined," and "boned," referring to bones.  The implication is that the bones are prominent and lacking the flesh that would normally cover them.  The sense of "unrefined" in "raw" might also contribute to a suggestion of roughness or lack of polish in appearance.
