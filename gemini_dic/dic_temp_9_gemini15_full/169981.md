protandric:/proʊˈtændrɪk/| adj. |雄性先熟的；雌雄异熟的（指生物）|  Relating to or denoting a type of sequential hermaphroditism in which an organism is first male and then female.  This is a form of sexual differentiation where the individual develops first as a male and then changes to a female later in life. This contrasts with protogynous, where the organism is first female and then male.  | Example:  Many species of fish exhibit protandric hermaphroditism.  许多鱼类表现出雄性先熟的雌雄同体现象。


The clownfish is a classic example of a protandric species. 小丑鱼是雄性先熟物种的典型例子。
