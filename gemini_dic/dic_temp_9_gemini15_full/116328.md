The word "masteris" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide you with helpful information, I need a correctly spelled word.  Please double-check the spelling or provide the intended word.
