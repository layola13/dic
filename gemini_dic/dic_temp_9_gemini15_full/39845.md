词源:

The word "constable" comes from the Old French word "conestable," which ultimately derives from the Latin "comes stabuli," meaning "count of the stable."  Originally, constables were high-ranking officials responsible for the king's stables and later for military and administrative duties. Over time, the role evolved, and the title came to be associated with local law enforcement.
