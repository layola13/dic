nonviviparity: /ˌnɒnˌvɪvɪˈpærɪti/ | n. |非胎生；卵生 | The state of not being viviparous;  laying eggs rather than giving birth to live young.  This term describes reproductive strategies in which offspring develop outside the mother's body. | Example:  Many species of reptiles exhibit nonviviparity.  许多爬行动物物种表现出卵生。| 近义词: oviparity, egg-laying | 反义词: viviparity


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Nonviviparity is common among reptiles. = 卵生在爬行动物中很常见。
The bird displays nonviviparity. = 这只鸟表现出卵生。


一般过去时:
Scientists observed nonviviparity in this species. = 科学家在这个物种中观察到卵生。
The study confirmed nonviviparity as the primary reproductive strategy. = 这项研究证实卵生是主要的繁殖策略。


现在完成时:
Researchers have documented nonviviparity in several insect groups. = 研究人员已在几个昆虫类群中记录了卵生。
This species has shown nonviviparity for many generations. = 这个物种已经几代都表现出卵生了。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, scientists had believed in viviparity. = 在发现之前，科学家们相信是胎生。
It had been assumed that nonviviparity was the ancestral state. = 人们曾认为卵生是祖先的状态。


将来时:
Further research will investigate the evolutionary shift from nonviviparity to viviparity. = 后续研究将调查从卵生到胎生的进化转变。
We will likely find more examples of nonviviparity in the future. = 我们将来可能会发现更多卵生的例子。


虚拟语气:
If this species were viviparous, it would have different adaptations. = 如果这个物种是胎生的，它将具有不同的适应性。
It is unlikely that this reptile would survive if it were not nonviviparous. = 如果这种爬行动物不是卵生，它就不太可能存活。


被动语态:
Nonviviparity is often observed in birds. = 卵生经常在鸟类中被观察到。
The evolutionary pressures leading to nonviviparity are being studied. = 导致卵生的进化压力正在被研究。


疑问句:
Is nonviviparity a defining characteristic of this group? = 卵生是该类群的决定性特征吗？
Does nonviviparity offer any advantages in this environment? = 卵生在这个环境中是否提供任何优势？


否定句:
This species is not characterized by nonviviparity; it is viviparous. = 这个物种的特征不是卵生；它是胎生的。
The study did not support the hypothesis of ancestral nonviviparity. = 这项研究不支持祖先卵生的假设。


PHRASE->
There is no common phrase directly using "nonviviparity". The concept is generally expressed using phrases like:
