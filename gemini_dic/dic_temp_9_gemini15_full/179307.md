词源:
The word "redocketed" is formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") to the word "docket."  While "docket" primarily means a list of cases, in this context it refers to the action of placing something in a socket or receptacle.  Therefore, "redocketed" implies the act of placing something back into its socket, after it has been removed.  The usage is somewhat specialized and not found in standard dictionaries as a common word, but is understandable from its component parts.
