pseudoracemic: /ˌsuːdoʊreɪˈseɪmɪk/ | adj. | 假外消旋的；似外消旋的 |  Describes a mixture of enantiomers that appears to be racemic (containing equal amounts of two enantiomers) but is not truly racemic because the enantiomers are not present in exactly equal amounts, or because the mixture exhibits properties distinct from a true racemic mixture.  This often occurs when the enantiomers form diastereomeric complexes or salts that exhibit different properties. | Example: The initially formed precipitate appeared pseudoracemic, but further analysis revealed a slight enantiomeric excess. |近义词:apparently racemic, quasi-racemic |反义词: truly racemic, enantiopure


词源:

* **pseudo-**:  From Greek *pseudes* meaning "false" or "lying."
* **racemic**: From Latin *racemus* meaning "bunch of grapes," referring to the crystal habit of some racemic compounds.

用法说明:

Pseudoracemic is primarily used in chemistry, specifically in stereochemistry, to describe mixtures of chiral molecules.  It highlights the difference between a mixture that *appears* to be racemic (having a 1:1 ratio of enantiomers) and a mixture that is truly racemic at a molecular level.  The properties of a pseudoracemic mixture might differ from a true racemic mixture due to different interactions between the enantiomers, for example, through hydrogen bonding or crystal packing effects.  The term emphasizes the deceptive nature of the initial observation, requiring further investigation to confirm the actual enantiomeric composition.
