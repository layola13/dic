USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective and doesn't have verb or noun forms that follow typical tense conjugations.  Its usage is descriptive, not action-oriented. Therefore, grammatical tenses (present, past, future, etc.) don't apply in the same way as with verbs.

PHRASE->
The word "postholocaust" is not typically used in phrases in the same way as a common word like "what".  It's used as a modifying adjective to describe a noun.

Examples of its use in phrases:

postholocaust literature: 大屠杀后文学
postholocaust trauma: 大屠杀后创伤
postholocaust identity: 大屠杀后身份认同

词源:

The word is a compound word.  "Post" is a prefix meaning "after" or "following," and "Holocaust" refers to the systematic state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews by the Nazi regime and its collaborators.  Therefore, "postholocaust" literally means "after the Holocaust."
