词源:  The word "reacclimatizing" is formed from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again"), the word "acclimatizing" (meaning "to become accustomed to a new climate or environment"), which itself comes from "acclimatize," which is a combination of "ac-" (a variant of "ad-" meaning "to") and "climate."  Therefore, the word literally means "to become accustomed to a climate again."
