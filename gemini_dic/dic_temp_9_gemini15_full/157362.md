词源:

The word "piperly" is believed to be derived from "piper," referring to a person who plays the pipe.  The association might stem from the perceived elegance and refinement often associated with musical performance and courtly life in earlier eras.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the noun into an adverbial adjective, describing a quality or manner.  The exact etymology requires further linguistic research, but this is a plausible explanation of its origin and evolution.
