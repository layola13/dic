notochord:/ˈnoʊtəˌkɔːrd/| n. |脊索|A notochord is a flexible rod-like structure that forms the main support of the body in the lowest chordates (such as the lancelets) and the embryos of higher chordates (such as vertebrates).  It is replaced by the vertebral column (spine) in most vertebrates during development.|Example: The notochord is a defining characteristic of chordates.|近义词: axial rod|反义词: vertebral column


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The notochord provides support for the developing embryo. = 脊索为发育中的胚胎提供支撑。
The notochord runs along the dorsal side of the body. = 脊索沿着身体的背侧延伸。


一般过去时:
The notochord was replaced by the spine during development. = 在发育过程中，脊索被脊柱取代。
Scientists studied the notochord's structure in detail. = 科学家们详细研究了脊索的结构。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified the genes involved in notochord formation. = 研究人员已经确定了参与脊索形成的基因。
The function of the notochord has been well-documented. = 脊索的功能已被充分记录。


过去完成时:
The spine had already begun to form before the notochord fully disappeared. = 在脊索完全消失之前，脊柱已经开始形成。
Embryologists had long been studying the development of the notochord. = 胚胎学家们长期以来一直在研究脊索的发育。


将来时:
Scientists will continue to investigate the role of the notochord in development. = 科学家们将继续研究脊索在发育中的作用。
Further research will reveal more about the notochord's genetic regulation. = 进一步的研究将揭示更多关于脊索基因调控的信息。


虚拟语气:
If the notochord did not develop properly, severe developmental defects would result. = 如果脊索发育不正常，将会导致严重的生长缺陷。
It is hypothesized that if the notochord were absent, the embryo would not survive. = 假设如果脊索不存在，胚胎将无法存活。


被动语态:
The notochord is often studied in developmental biology. = 脊索经常在发育生物学中被研究。
The genes responsible for notochord development are being actively investigated. = 负责脊索发育的基因正在被积极研究。


疑问句:
What is the evolutionary origin of the notochord? = 脊索的进化起源是什么？
How does the notochord contribute to body plan formation? = 脊索如何促进身体结构的形成？


否定句:
The notochord is not present in adult vertebrates, except in some cases. = 除了某些情况，脊索不存在于成年脊椎动物中。
The notochord does not directly participate in locomotion in most adult animals. = 在大多数成年动物中，脊索不直接参与运动。


PHRASE->
notochord formation
notochord development
notochord differentiation
persistent notochord
dorsal notochord
