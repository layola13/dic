词源:
The word "restagnation" is formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") to "stagnation."  "Stagnation" itself comes from the Latin word "stagnare," meaning "to stand still" or "to be still."  Therefore, "restagnation" literally implies a return to or a renewed state of being still or inactive.
