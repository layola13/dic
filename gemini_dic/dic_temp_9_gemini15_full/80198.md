词源:

The word "godlikeness" is a modern English word formed by combining "godlike" (itself an adjective meaning resembling a god) with the suffix "-ness," which creates a noun indicating a state or quality.  The root "god" derives from Old English *god, ultimately from Proto-Germanic *gudiz, related to Proto-Indo-European *ghut-.  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix of Germanic origin, meaning "state of being".
