electropositivity:/ɪˌlektrəʊˌpɒzɪˈtɪvɪti/ | n. | 电正性 | The tendency of an atom to lose electrons and form positive ions.  It's a measure of how readily an element loses electrons in a chemical reaction.  The higher the electropositivity, the more readily the element loses electrons. | Example:  Alkali metals exhibit high electropositivity. 碱金属表现出高电正性。  The electropositivity of sodium is greater than that of magnesium. 钠的电正性大于镁。|近义词：electronegativity的反义词 | 反义词：electronegativity |  词性:名词
