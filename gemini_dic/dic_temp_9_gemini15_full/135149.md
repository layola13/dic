The word "nonomission" is a relatively uncommon word formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") and "omission" (meaning "the act of omitting something"). Therefore, it literally means "not omitting" or "the act of not omitting something". However, in practical usage, it often implies a deliberate avoidance of an action, especially one that was expected or required.
