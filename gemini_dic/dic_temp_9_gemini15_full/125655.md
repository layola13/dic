词源:
The word "mumming" originates from the Middle English word "momen," meaning "to speak in a low voice" or "to murmur."  This evolved from the Old French "momer," which had a similar meaning, often associated with disguising one's voice or identity.  Over time, the association with masked performances and disguised behavior led to its current meaning.
