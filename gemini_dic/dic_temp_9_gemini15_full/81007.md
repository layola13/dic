词源:
The word "grading" comes from the verb "grade," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "grader," meaning "to step, to go by steps."  This reflects the idea of assigning levels or steps of quality or achievement.  The concept of assigning numerical or letter grades to assess student performance is a relatively modern development.
