quasi-essentially: /ˈkwɑːziːɪˈsɛnʃəli/ | adj. | 准本质上地，几乎本质地 |


英文解析:  The word "quasi-essentially" combines "quasi-" (meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent") with "essentially" (meaning "fundamentally," "basically," or "in its essence").  Therefore, "quasi-essentially" describes something that is almost, but not completely, essential or fundamental. It implies a near-essential nature, but with a slight qualification or reservation.


例句:

The argument, while seemingly persuasive, is only quasi-essentially relevant to the central issue. = 虽然这个论点看似有说服力，但它与核心问题只是几乎本质上相关。
