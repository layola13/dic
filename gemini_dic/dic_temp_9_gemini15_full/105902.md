词源:

The word "kittle" ultimately derives from Old English "cittlian," meaning "to tickle," or "to provoke."  This connection reflects the sense of being easily provoked or irritated, a core meaning of the modern word.  Over time, the meaning shifted and broadened, encompassing other nuances like "trifling" or "small in amount," although the core sense of being easily agitated remains prominent.

用法说明:

While "kittle" is not frequently used in modern English, it retains a distinct flavor, often appearing in literary contexts or dialects.  It's primarily used as an adjective.  Its meanings can be nuanced depending on context:


1. **Easily provoked to anger; irritable:** This is the most common and readily understood meaning.  It suggests a temperament prone to fits of anger or annoyance.


2. **Fickle; changeable:**  This meaning is less frequent but still valid.  It describes something or someone that is unstable or unreliable, shifting moods or opinions easily.


3. **Trifling; small in amount:** This usage is rarer and often associated with older or regional dialects.  It refers to something of little importance or insignificant quantity.
