词源:

The word "massing" comes from the Old French word "masse," meaning "lump" or "bulk," which in turn derives from the Latin word "massa," with the same meaning. The architectural and artistic use of the word developed from the literal sense of accumulating material to the more abstract sense of arranging elements in a design.
