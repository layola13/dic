megapixel:/ˈmɛɡəˌpɪksəl/| n. |百万像素|A megapixel is a unit of measurement for image resolution equal to one million pixels.  It refers to the total number of pixels in an image sensor or display, which directly impacts the image's detail and clarity. Higher megapixel counts generally result in larger image files and the ability to produce higher-resolution prints. |例句：The camera boasts a 20-megapixel sensor, capable of capturing stunningly detailed images. 这款相机拥有 2000 万像素传感器，能够拍摄令人惊叹的细节丰富的图像。

例句：My new phone has a 50-megapixel camera, allowing for amazing enlargements without significant loss of quality.我的新手机有 5000 万像素摄像头，可以进行惊人的放大而不会显着损失质量。|近义词：resolution (in terms of image quality)|反义词：low resolution


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The camera uses a 12-megapixel sensor. = 这款相机使用 1200 万像素传感器。
This image is only 2 megapixels. = 这张图片只有 200 万像素。


一般过去时:
My old phone had only a 5-megapixel camera. = 我的旧手机只有 500 万像素摄像头。
The photographer used a 100-megapixel camera for this project. = 摄影师在这个项目中使用了 1 亿像素的相机。


现在完成时:
They have upgraded their camera to a higher megapixel count. = 他们已将相机升级到更高的像素数。
We have already seen the benefits of higher megapixel cameras. = 我们已经看到了更高像素相机的好处。


过去完成时:
Before buying this camera, I had only used 1-megapixel cameras. = 在买这台相机之前，我只用过 100 万像素的相机。
The resolution was poor; they had only used a low-megapixel camera. = 分辨率很差；他们只使用了一台低像素的相机。


将来时:
Future phones will likely have even higher megapixel cameras. = 未来的手机可能会配备更高像素的摄像头。
We will need a camera with a higher megapixel count for this project. = 我们这个项目需要一台更高像素的相机。


虚拟语气:
If it had a higher megapixel count, the image would be sharper. = 如果它有更高的像素数，图像会更清晰。
I wish my old camera had a higher megapixel count. = 我希望我的旧相机有更高的像素数。


被动语态:
The image was captured with a high-megapixel camera. = 这张照片是用高像素相机拍摄的。
High-resolution images are often produced with high-megapixel cameras. = 高分辨率图像通常是用高像素相机生成的。


疑问句:
What is the megapixel count of your camera? = 你相机的像素是多少？
How many megapixels does this camera have? = 这款相机有多少像素？


否定句:
This camera does not have a very high megapixel count. = 这款相机像素数不是很高。
The image quality is poor because it wasn't taken with a high-megapixel camera. = 图片质量很差，因为不是用高像素相机拍摄的。


PHRASE->
high megapixel = 高像素
low megapixel = 低像素
megapixel camera = 百万像素相机
megapixel sensor = 百万像素传感器
megapixel resolution = 百万像素分辨率
