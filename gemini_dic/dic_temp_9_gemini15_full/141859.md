词源:
The word "orchestrating" comes from the word "orchestra," which itself derives from the ancient Greek word ὀρχήστρα (orkhēstra), meaning "dancing place."  Originally referring to the space where the chorus danced in ancient Greek theaters, the term evolved to refer to the group of musicians playing together, and eventually to the act of arranging and coordinating the elements of a musical composition.  The "-ing" suffix indicates the present participle, signifying the act of doing something.
