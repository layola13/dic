词源:The term "funny-bones" is of uncertain origin.  While the connection to the elbow is clear (a bump to the elbow often elicits a humorous reaction due to the resulting pain), the exact etymology of the phrase remains debated.  It's likely a combination of the humorous sensation associated with an elbow bump and the general sense of "funny" meaning amusing or strange.  The term's popularity likely increased through colloquial use and word-of-mouth transmission.  There's no single definitive source or historical record pinpointing its precise origin.
