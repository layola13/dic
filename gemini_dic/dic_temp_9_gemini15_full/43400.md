词源:

The word "crankish" ultimately derives from "crank," meaning a person with eccentric or odd ideas.  The "crank" itself has a complex etymology, possibly related to the Old English word "cranc," meaning "sick" or "ailing," or perhaps to a different root related to bending or twisting. The -ish suffix adds a qualitative element, signifying a tendency or characteristic.  Thus, "crankish" signifies having the qualities of a crank, namely being eccentric and irritable.
