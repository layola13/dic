gneisses:/ˈnaɪsiːz/| n. |片麻岩|Gneisses are metamorphic rocks characterized by a banded texture, resulting from the alignment of minerals during regional metamorphism. They are typically composed of feldspar, quartz, and mica, and can exhibit a wide range of colors and compositions depending on the parent rock and the degree of metamorphism.|The exposed bedrock in this area consists largely of gneisses and schists.  这个地区的裸露基岩主要由片麻岩和片岩组成。|schists, schistose rocks| (no direct antonym)|名词
