phosphoroscope:/ˈfɒsfərəskoʊp/ | n. |磷光镜，荧光镜 | An instrument used to observe the persistence of phosphorescence or fluorescence in a substance. It typically involves rapidly interrupting the illumination of the substance and then observing the decay of its emitted light.  | Example: Scientists used a phosphoroscope to study the afterglow of certain minerals. 科学家们用磷光镜研究某些矿物的余辉。|近义词: fluoroscope (for fluorescence)|反义词: None specifically.

将来时:
We will use a phosphoroscope to analyze the sample. = 我们将用磷光镜来分析样品。
The lab will acquire a more advanced phosphoroscope next year. = 实验室明年将购置一台更先进的磷光镜。


虚拟语气:
If we had a phosphoroscope, we could conduct the experiment. = 如果我们有磷光镜，我们就可以进行实验。

The phosphoroscope is being calibrated for the next experiment. = 磷光镜正在为下一次实验进行校准。


疑问句:
What type of phosphoroscope are you using? = 你在使用什么类型的磷光镜？
Does the phosphoroscope require special maintenance? = 磷光镜需要特殊的维护吗？


否定句:
The experiment did not use a phosphoroscope. = 该实验没有使用磷光镜。
