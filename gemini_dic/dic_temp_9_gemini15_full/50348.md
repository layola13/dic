depolarizer: /ˌdiːˈpoʊləraɪzər/ | n. | 去极化剂；去极化物 | A depolarizer is a substance that reduces or eliminates polarization, often used in batteries or electrochemical cells to prevent the buildup of charge that would otherwise hinder their operation.  It facilitates the flow of current by consuming the products of the electrochemical reaction that cause polarization. | Example:  The battery's depolarizer prevented the buildup of hydrogen gas, ensuring consistent power output.  电池的去极化剂防止了氢气的积聚，确保了稳定的电力输出。 | 近义词：depolarizing agent | 反义词：polarizer
