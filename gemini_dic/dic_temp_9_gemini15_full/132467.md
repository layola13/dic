词源:
The word "nonderelict" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "derelict," which derives from the Latin word "derelictus," the past participle of "dereliquere," meaning "to leave behind," "to abandon," or "to forsake."  Therefore, "nonderelict" literally means "not left behind" or "not abandoned."
