chitinization: /ˌkaɪtɪnɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. |几丁质化；几丁质形成| The process by which chitin is formed or deposited.  It refers to the formation of chitin, a tough, protective polysaccharide found in the exoskeletons of arthropods and the cell walls of fungi. |例句：The chitinization of the insect cuticle is crucial for its protection and survival.  昆虫表皮的几丁质化对其保护和生存至关重要。

The chitinization process in crustaceans is influenced by environmental factors. 甲壳类动物的几丁质化过程受环境因素影响。


近义词：chitin formation,  cuticle hardening |反义词：de-chitinization (Not a common word, but implies the removal of chitin) |词性 n.
