nonalkaloids:/ˌnɒnˈælkəlɔɪdz/ | n. |非生物碱类物质|Substances that are not alkaloids.  These compounds lack the characteristic basic nitrogen-containing heterocyclic ring structure typical of alkaloids. They may share some similar pharmacological properties with alkaloids but do not possess the defining chemical structure. |Example:  Many plant extracts contain a complex mixture of nonalkaloids and alkaloids. 许多植物提取物含有非生物碱和生物碱的复杂混合物。|近义词: non-alkaloidal compounds |反义词: alkaloids
