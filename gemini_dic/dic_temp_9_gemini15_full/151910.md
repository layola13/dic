词源:
From Middle English *pasturne, from Old French pasturon, from Vulgar Latin *pastorium, alteration of Latin pastus "food," "pasture," referring to the area where animals graze, hence, the part of the leg near the ground.  The connection lies in the pastern's proximity to the ground and its role in supporting the animal's weight while grazing.
