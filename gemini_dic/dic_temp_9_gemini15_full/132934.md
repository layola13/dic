词源：

The word "nonembellished" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "embellished."  "Embellished" comes from the Old French word "embellir," meaning "to make beautiful," which itself is composed of the prefix "em-" (intensifying) and "bellir" (from "bel," meaning "beautiful"). Therefore, "nonembellished" literally means "not made beautiful" or "not adorned."


用法说明：

"Nonembellished" is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that lacks ornamentation, decoration, or exaggeration.  It implies a direct, straightforward presentation, free from embellishment or elaboration.  It's often used in contexts where accuracy and truthfulness are paramount, such as in factual reporting or historical accounts.
