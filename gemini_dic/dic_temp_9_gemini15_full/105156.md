The word "kettin" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* **A proper noun:**  It could be a name, place, or brand name.
* **A slang term or regional dialect word:** Its meaning would be restricted to a specific community or region.
* **A newly coined word:**  It may be a very recent addition to the language not yet widely recognized.


To provide the analysis you requested, I need the correct spelling or more context about where you encountered this word.
