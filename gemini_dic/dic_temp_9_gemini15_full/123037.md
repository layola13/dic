The word "moned" is not a recognized word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a very specialized field, or a word from another language.  To provide an analysis, I would need more context about where you encountered this word.
