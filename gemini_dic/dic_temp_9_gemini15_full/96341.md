indigometry:/ɪnˌdɪɡəˈmɛtri/| n. |靛蓝测定法；靛蓝测定术 |The quantitative determination of indigo, typically in plant extracts, using titration methods.  It involves oxidizing the indigo dye with a standardized oxidizing agent and measuring the volume of the oxidant required for complete oxidation. This allows for the determination of the indigo content. |例句：Indigometry was crucial in the textile industry for assessing the quality and concentration of indigo dye in natural sources.|近义词：indigo analysis, dye assay |反义词：N/A

词源:
The word "indigometry" is a modern scientific term coined by combining "indigo" (referring to the indigo dye) and "-metry" (a suffix indicating measurement or analysis).  "Indigo" itself originates from the Greek word "indikon," which was used by the ancient Greeks to refer to a blue dye derived from plants. "-metry" comes from the Greek "-metria," meaning "measurement".
