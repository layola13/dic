The word "exotoxins" does not exist in standard English.  It's likely a misspelling or a rarely used neologism.  The intended word is probably **exotoxins**.


exotoxins: /ˌɛksoʊˈtɒksɪnz/ | n. | 外毒素 | Exotoxins are toxins secreted by bacteria into the surrounding environment.  They are often proteins and can cause a wide range of diseases by damaging host cells or disrupting their normal functions.  |

例句：

Many bacterial infections are caused by the release of exotoxins. = 许多细菌感染是由外毒素的释放引起的。

The exotoxins produced by *Clostridium botulinum* cause botulism. = 肉毒梭菌产生的外毒素会导致肉毒中毒。


近义词：toxins (毒素), bacterial toxins (细菌毒素), venoms (毒液) (in some contexts)


反义词：There isn't a direct antonym, but "endogenous substances" (内源性物质) could be considered an opposite in the sense that they are produced within the organism itself, rather than secreted by bacteria.
