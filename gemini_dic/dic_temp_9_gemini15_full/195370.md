semimaturenesses:/ˌsemiˈmætʃəriˌnɛsɪz/| n. |半成熟状态；半成熟的事物|The word "semimaturenesses" is a rare and somewhat awkward plural noun. It refers to multiple instances or aspects of being semimature.  Semimature itself means partially mature, not fully developed. The word is formed by combining "semi" (half, partly) with "matureness" (the state of being mature).  Because of its complexity and infrequent use, there are no readily available examples in common corpora or dictionaries.  It's a word more likely to be encountered in highly specialized or technical contexts, perhaps in biology, psychology or horticulture where describing stages of development is crucial.|  The study explored the various semimaturenesses observed in the plant specimens.  |近义词:partial maturities, stages of development|反义词:maturities, full developments|名词
