The word "cocono" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown cannot be provided.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps you could provide more context where you encountered this word.

2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name (person, place, or thing), a brand name, or a neologism (newly coined word) specific to a certain community or field.

3. **It's a word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into English.  If you can provide the language of origin, it might be possible to provide a translation and explanation.


Without further information, I cannot offer a complete analysis as requested in the format.  Please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
