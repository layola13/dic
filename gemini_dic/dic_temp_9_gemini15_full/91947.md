词源:
The word is a combination of:

* **hyper-**:  A prefix meaning "excessive," "beyond," or "above."
* **miraculous**:  Adjective meaning "amazing," "extraordinary," or "supernatural."  Derived from "miracle," ultimately from Latin *miraculum* ("wonderful thing").
* **-ness**: A suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, denoting a quality or state.

Therefore, hypermiraculousness literally means "the state or quality of being excessively miraculous."
