rhodosperm:/ˈroʊdəˌspɜːrm/| n. |红藻精子；红藻精子| A reproductive cell (gamete) of a red alga.  The term specifically refers to the male gamete. It is less common than the broader term "gamete" but is useful when specifying the reproductive cell type in red algae.| Example: The rhodosperms of this particular species are known for their unusually large size.|近义词: red algal gamete, male gamete|反义词:  N/A (no direct antonym, but could consider female gamete as a contrasting term)
