词源:  The word "devastated" comes from the past participle of the verb "devastate," which itself originates from the Old French word "devasté," meaning "laid waste," "desolated," or "ruined."  The Old French word is a derivative of "vaster," meaning "to waste" or "lay waste," ultimately connected to the Latin "vastare" with the same meaning.  The prefix "de-" intensifies the meaning.
