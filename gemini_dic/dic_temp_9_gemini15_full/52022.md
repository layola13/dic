diaheliotropism: /ˌdaɪəˌhiːliˈoʊtroʊpɪzəm/ | n. | 向光性（指植物器官在一天中随着太阳方向变化而运动的特性）| Diaheliotropism refers to the diurnal movement of plant organs, such as leaves, in response to the sun's position throughout the day.  The plant parts orient themselves to maximize light capture during the day and minimize it during the hottest parts of the day. This is a specialized form of heliotropism. | Example:  The sunflower's diaheliotropism is a fascinating example of plant adaptation to optimize photosynthesis. 向日葵的向光性是植物为了优化光合作用而进行适应的一个引人入胜的例子。| 近义词: heliotropism (更广义的向光性)| 反义词:  apheliotropism (背光性) |  名词
