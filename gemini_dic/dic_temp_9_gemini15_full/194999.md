semi-works:/ˈsɛmiˌwɜːrks/| n. |半工厂化生产；半规模生产|A semi-works plant is a facility that is larger than a laboratory but smaller than a full-scale production plant. It is used for testing and developing new processes and products before they are implemented in a full-scale production environment.  |The company is currently testing the new process in a semi-works plant before scaling up to full production.|近义词：pilot plant, demonstration plant|反义词：full-scale production


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The semi-works plant operates 24/7. = 半工厂化生产工厂全天候运行。
This semi-works facility produces small batches of the product. = 这个半工厂化生产设施生产少量产品。

一般过去时:
The semi-works trial ran for six months. = 半工厂化试验进行了六个月。
The engineers tested the new catalyst in the semi-works. = 工程师们在半工厂化生产中测试了新型催化剂。


现在完成时:
They have completed several runs in the semi-works plant. = 他们在半工厂化生产工厂已经完成了几次运行。
The company has invested heavily in its semi-works facilities. = 公司对其半工厂化生产设施进行了大量投资。


过去完成时:
Before full-scale production, they had already tested the process in the semi-works. = 在大规模生产之前，他们已经在半工厂化生产中测试了该工艺。
The team had optimized the process parameters in the semi-works before moving to the full-scale plant. = 在转向大型工厂之前，团队已经在半工厂化生产中优化了工艺参数。
