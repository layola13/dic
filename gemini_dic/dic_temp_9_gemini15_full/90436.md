The word "{hsien}" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a romanization of a word from another language, most probably Chinese.  If you intended to write "hsien" as a romanization of the Chinese word 县 (xiàn), then I can provide the analysis.

Assuming you meant the Chinese word 县 (xiàn), romanized as "hsien":

/ʃjɛn/ | n. | 县 (县城) | A hsien is a county-level administrative division in some regions of China, especially Taiwan. It's a subdivision of a prefecture-level city or a prefecture.  It's a smaller administrative unit than a prefecture but larger than a township or village. |  The family lived in a small hsien in rural Taiwan.  这家住在台湾农村的一个小县城里。 |  district, county |  province, prefecture, municipality | noun


USAGE->

This word, as a noun, doesn't have verb conjugations.  Therefore, sections like "general present tense," "past tense," etc., are not applicable.


PHRASE->

Phrases using "hsien" would depend on the context and the intended meaning.  Examples might include:

* **hsien government:** 县政府 (xiàn zhèngfǔ) - county government

* **hsien seat:** 县城 (xiàn chéng) - county seat (the main town of a county)
