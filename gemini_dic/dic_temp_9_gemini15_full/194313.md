self-penetrability: /ˌsɛlf ˌpɛnɪˈtreɪtəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 自我渗透性，自穿透性 | The ability of something to penetrate or pass through itself.  This term is often used in the context of materials science, topology, or abstract mathematical concepts.  It describes a property where a system or object can interact with or influence its own internal structure or components. For example, a hypothetical material with self-penetrability could have parts that pass through other parts of itself. | Example: The model exhibits unusual self-penetrability, allowing for the simulation of complex, overlapping structures.  | 近义词: self-interaction, internal permeability | 反义词:  impermeability, impenetrability


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in highly specialized contexts (mathematics, physics, materials science) and doesn't have common usage across different grammatical tenses. The verb form ("to self-penetrate") is similarly uncommon.  Therefore, providing examples across different tenses would be artificial and misleading.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases associated with "self-penetrability."  The word itself is highly technical and not used in everyday language or even most scientific discourse outside its specific niche.
