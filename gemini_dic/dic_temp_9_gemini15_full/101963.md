isobaric:/ˌaɪsoʊˈbærɪk/| adj.|等压的，恒压的|Relating to or denoting a process or system in which the pressure remains constant.|The isobaric process is a thermodynamic process that occurs at constant pressure. 等压过程是一个在恒定压力下发生的热力学过程。|近义词：constant-pressure|反义词：isochoric


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The pressure remains isobaric during the experiment. = 实验过程中压力保持恒定。
This reaction occurs under isobaric conditions. = 反应在等压条件下进行。


一般过去时:
The system was isobaric throughout the reaction. = 在整个反应过程中，系统保持等压。
The pressure remained isobaric during the previous test. = 在之前的测试中，压力保持恒定。


现在完成时:
The scientists have maintained isobaric conditions in their latest research. = 科学家们在他们最新的研究中保持了等压条件。
We have ensured the process has remained isobaric. = 我们确保了该过程保持等压。


过去完成时:
The pressure had been isobaric before the valve was opened. = 在阀门打开之前，压力一直保持恒定。
The experiment had maintained isobaric conditions until the final stage. = 实验直到最后阶段才保持等压条件。


将来时:
The pressure will remain isobaric throughout the planned experiment. = 在计划的实验过程中，压力将保持恒定。
We will ensure the reaction occurs under isobaric conditions. = 我们将确保反应在等压条件下进行。


虚拟语气:
If the process were isobaric, the calculations would be simpler. = 如果过程是等压的，计算就会简单得多。
It would be ideal if we could maintain perfectly isobaric conditions. = 如果我们能够保持完美的等压条件，那就最好了。


被动语态:
Isobaric conditions were maintained throughout the experiment. = 整个实验过程中都保持了等压条件。
The reaction is expected to be conducted under isobaric conditions. = 预计该反应将在等压条件下进行。


疑问句:
Is the process isobaric? = 这个过程是等压的吗？
Are the conditions isobaric during the reaction? = 反应过程中条件是等压的吗？


否定句:
The process was not isobaric; the pressure fluctuated. = 该过程不是等压的；压力波动。
The reaction did not occur under strictly isobaric conditions. = 该反应并非在严格的等压条件下进行。


PHRASE->
Isobaric process = 等压过程
Isobaric heating = 等压加热
