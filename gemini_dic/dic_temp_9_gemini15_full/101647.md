词源:

The word "irrefutableness" is derived from the adjective "irrefutable," which itself comes from the verb "refute."  "Refute" originates from the Latin word "refutare," meaning "to repulse, drive back, or disprove." The prefix "ir-" indicates negation, making "irrefutable" mean "not able to be refuted" or "undeniable."  Adding "-ness" creates the noun form, signifying the state or quality of being irrefutable.
