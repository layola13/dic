The word "rerising" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need to consider possible intended words:


**Possible Intended Words and Their Analyses:**

If the intended word was **"rising"**:
