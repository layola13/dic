词源:

The word is a compound of "clear" and "sighted."  "Clear" signifies being free from obscurity or confusion, while "sighted" relates to having sight or vision, but in this context, it implies the ability to see beyond the surface and perceive deeper truths.  The combination thus suggests a sharp, unclouded perception.
