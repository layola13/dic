词源:  Derived from "messiah" + "-ship," a suffix forming nouns denoting state, condition, or quality. "Messiah" itself originates from the Hebrew word מָשִׁיחַ (mashiach), meaning "anointed one," referring to a king or other leader anointed with sacred oil.  This term was adopted into Greek as Μεσσίας (Messias) and then into English.
