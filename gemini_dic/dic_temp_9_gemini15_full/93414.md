英文解析:

Illocution refers to the speaker's intended meaning in making an utterance.  It's the effect the speaker aims to achieve through their words, rather than simply the literal meaning of the words themselves. This is distinct from the locution (what is said) and the perlocution (the effect on the hearer). For example, saying "It's cold in here" can be a locution (the literal statement), an illocution (a request to close the window), and a perlocution (someone actually closing the window). The illocutionary force is the intended effect or purpose.
