capacitances:/kəˈpæsɪtənsɪz/ | n. | 电容（复数） | The capacitances of the two capacitors are different. |  近义词：capacitive properties | 反义词：无


英文解析:Capacitance is the ability of a system to store an electric charge.  It's a measure of how much charge can be stored for a given voltage.  The term "capacitances" refers to multiple capacitances, each representing a different storage capacity.  It's often used in the context of circuits with multiple capacitors.


例句:

The circuit's performance depends on the capacitances of its various components.  | 电路的性能取决于其各个组件的电容。

We measured the capacitances of several capacitors using a capacitance meter. | 我们使用电容表测量了几个电容器的电容。


USAGE->

一般现在时:

The capacitances vary with temperature. | 电容随温度而变化。

These capacitances determine the filter's cutoff frequency. | 这些电容决定了滤波器的截止频率。


一般过去时:
