词源:
The word "interfiltrating" is formed from the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and the verb "filtrate" (meaning "to pass through a filter" or "to permeate").  The "-ing" suffix indicates the present participle, making it an adjective in this context.  The underlying concept of "filtration" contributes to the sense of a gradual and often subtle mixing or penetration.
