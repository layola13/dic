词源:  Derived from "dandy," a term for a man who pays excessive attention to his clothes and appearance. "Dandy" itself has a complex etymology, possibly originating from a Scottish word meaning "a small, smart man." The "-fied" suffix indicates that something has been made or rendered in a particular way, in this case, made like a dandy.
