Etymology:

The word "quasi-tangible" is a compound word formed from two parts:

* **quasi-**:  This prefix derives from the Latin word "quasi," meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation to something but not an exact equivalent.

* **tangible**: This word originates from the Middle English word "tangible," which in turn comes from the Latin word "tangibilis," meaning "capable of being touched."  It describes something that can be perceived by touch, and thus, is physical or material.


Therefore, "quasi-tangible" literally means "almost capable of being touched" or "almost physically perceptible."  It describes something that possesses qualities that suggest physical existence but falls short of complete materiality.
