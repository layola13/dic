lossier:/ˈlɒsiər/| adj.| 损耗更大的，损失更大的 |  Describes something that results in a greater loss or waste, often in terms of data or energy.  |The lossier compression algorithm resulted in a smaller file size but with noticeable image quality degradation.|近义词：more wasteful, less efficient | 反义词：less lossy, more efficient


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The lossier compression is causing significant data loss. = 损耗更大的压缩正在导致大量数据丢失。
This method is lossier than the previous one. = 这种方法比之前的方法损耗更大。


一般过去时:
The lossier encoding process led to a blurry image. = 损耗更大的编码过程导致图像模糊。
The older system was significantly lossier. = 旧系统损耗大得多。


现在完成时:
The new algorithm has proven to be less lossier than the old one. = 新算法已被证明比旧算法损耗更小。(注意：lossier本身没有比较级，此处为了说明用less修饰)
We have found that this approach is lossier than we initially anticipated. = 我们发现这种方法的损耗比我们最初预期的要大。


过去完成时:
The engineer had realized that the lossier compression had compromised the quality. = 工程师已经意识到损耗更大的压缩损害了质量。
They had chosen a lossier codec, resulting in poor audio. = 他们选择了损耗更大的编解码器，导致音频质量差。


将来时:
We will use a less lossier codec for the next video. = 我们将在下一个视频中使用损耗更小的编解码器。(注意：lossier本身没有比较级，此处为了说明用less修饰)
The new system will be less lossier than its predecessor. = 新系统将比其前身损耗更小。(注意：lossier本身没有比较级，此处为了说明用less修饰)


虚拟语气:
If we had used a less lossier algorithm, the image quality would have been better. = 如果我们使用了损耗更小的算法，图像质量就会更好。(注意：lossier本身没有比较级，此处为了说明用less修饰)
I wish we hadn't chosen such a lossier compression method. = 我真希望我们没有选择这种损耗如此大的压缩方法。


被动语态:
A smaller file size was achieved, but it was at the cost of a lossier compression. = 达到了较小的文件大小，但代价是使用了损耗更大的压缩。
The data was lost because a lossier compression algorithm was used. = 数据丢失是因为使用了损耗更大的压缩算法。


疑问句:
Is this compression method lossier than the others? = 这种压缩方法比其他方法损耗更大吗？
Why is this encoding process so lossier? = 为什么这个编码过程损耗这么大？


否定句:
The new system is not as lossier as the old one. = 新系统不像旧系统那样损耗大。(注意：lossier本身没有比较级，此处为了说明用as...as 来比较)
This algorithm is not lossier; it's actually more efficient. = 此算法并非损耗更大；它实际上更高效。


PHRASE->
lossier compression = 损耗更大的压缩
lossier algorithm = 损耗更大的算法
more lossier = 更损耗（虽然不规范，但可以理解）
less lossier = 损耗更小（虽然不规范，但可以理解）
highly lossier = 高损耗的


词源:  The word "lossier" is derived from "lossy," which itself comes from the noun "loss."  The "-ier" suffix is a comparative adjective ending, indicating a greater degree of loss.  Lossy compression techniques, common in digital audio and video, are contrasted with lossless compression, which preserves all data.
