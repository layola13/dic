词源:
The word "laureated" comes from the Latin word "laureatus," meaning "crowned with laurel."  Laurel wreaths were traditionally given to victors and those achieving great accomplishments in ancient Greece and Rome.  The word's evolution reflects the enduring association of laurel with honor and achievement.
