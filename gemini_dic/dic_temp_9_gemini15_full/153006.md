pedrail:/ˈpɛdreɪl/| n.|履带,步行道|A pedrail is a type of track used by vehicles, typically those designed for off-road travel, that consists of a series of interconnected legs or supports that move over the ground. Unlike wheeled or tracked vehicles, a pedrail vehicle distributes its weight more evenly, allowing it to traverse soft or uneven terrain.  |Example:  The experimental pedrail vehicle effortlessly crossed the marshy terrain.  实验性履带车辆轻松越过沼泽地。|近义词：track, caterpillar track|反义词：wheel, roller
