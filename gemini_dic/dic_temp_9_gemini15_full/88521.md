词源:

The phrase "hit-and-miss" is a compound of two nouns, "hit" and "miss."  "Hit" implies success, while "miss" implies failure. The combination reflects an unpredictable outcome where success and failure occur randomly.  The origin dates back to at least the 19th century, though the exact etymology is difficult to pinpoint to a single source.  Its widespread usage reflects the common human experience of encountering both success and failure in various endeavors.
