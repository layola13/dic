eikosylene:/aɪkɔːsəliːn/| n. |二十碳烯|A hypothetical alkene hydrocarbon with twenty carbon atoms and one double bond.  The exact structure isn't specified as there are many possible isomers.  It's primarily used in theoretical chemistry discussions or as a placeholder for a specific long-chain alkene.|Example:  The research paper analyzed the properties of eikosylene under high pressure.  研究论文分析了二十碳烯在高压下的特性。|近义词:  icosene (more common term for a 20-carbon alkene)|反义词:  None directly applicable,  as it's a specific chemical compound.  One could contrast it with saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes).|名词
