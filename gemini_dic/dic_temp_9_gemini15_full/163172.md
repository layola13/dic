precompel: /ˌpriːkəmˈpɛl/ | vt. |预先强迫；预先驱使 | To compel beforehand; to preordain.  This word is quite rare and largely obsolete. It suggests forcing or compelling something to happen before it naturally would.  | 例句：The tyrannical ruler attempted to precompel the people's allegiance through fear. = 暴君试图通过恐惧来预先强迫人民效忠。


The historical context and etymology are crucial to understanding this word. It's a combination of "pre-" (before) and "compel" (to force).  The word isn't formed from common usage and shows its archaic nature. There is no commonly accepted antonym.  The word's rarity makes providing examples of usage across different tenses challenging, as most examples would be constructed.
