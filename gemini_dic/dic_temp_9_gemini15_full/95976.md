词源:  The word "incumbent" comes from the Latin word *incumbere*, which means "to lean upon," "to lie upon," or "to rest upon."  The sense of duty or responsibility developed over time from the idea of something "resting upon" someone as a burden or obligation.  The "-on" is a preposition indicating the person or thing upon whom the duty rests.
