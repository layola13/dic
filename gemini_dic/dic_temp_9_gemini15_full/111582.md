PHRASE->
There are not many common phrases directly using "lobotomist".  The word itself is largely used in its literal sense.  Instead, we can explore phrases related to the procedure itself:
brain surgery
surgical procedure
mental health treatment (though often with negative connotations in this context)
frontal lobotomy
ice pick lobotomy


词源:
The word "lobotomist" is a modern coinage, combining "lobotomy" and "-ist."  "Lobotomy" itself is derived from "lobo-" (referring to the frontal lobe of the brain) and "-otomy" (meaning surgical incision).  Therefore, the word's origins lie in the medical procedure it describes.
