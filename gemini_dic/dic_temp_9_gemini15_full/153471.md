词源:

The word "penny-pinching" is a compound word, combining "penny" and "pinching."

* **Penny:**  Refers to a small unit of currency.  Its origins trace back to Old English "penig," ultimately from Latin "pennus," meaning "a small weight."  This reflects the historical use of pennies as small, relatively insignificant coins.

* **Pinching:**  Means to squeeze tightly, often implying a miserly or reluctant act. It derives from the Old English "pinccan," meaning "to pinch, nip, or squeeze."  The image here is of someone tightly gripping their pennies, unwilling to let go of even the smallest amount of money.


用法说明:

Penny-pinching is typically used as an adjective to describe a person or their behavior. It carries a slightly negative connotation, suggesting that the person is excessively frugal to the point of being unpleasant or ungenerous.  While frugality is generally seen as a positive trait, penny-pinching implies an unhealthy obsession with saving money, often at the expense of personal enjoyment or essential needs.  It's often used informally.
