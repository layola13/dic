missampling:/ˌmɪsˈsæmplɪŋ/| n.|错误采样，抽样误差|The act of obtaining a sample that is not representative of the population from which it is drawn. This can lead to inaccurate conclusions and biased results.  It often arises from flaws in the sampling design or the sampling process itself. | Example: Missampling in the survey led to inaccurate predictions of the election outcome.  The biased sample of only city dwellers skewed the results. |近义词：sampling error, biased sampling, flawed sampling|反义词：accurate sampling, representative sampling|名词
