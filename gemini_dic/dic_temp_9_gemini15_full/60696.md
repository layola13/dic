词源:

The word "electrifying" is derived from the verb "electrify," which itself comes from "electricity" + "-fy" (a suffix meaning "to make").  "Electricity" originates from the Greek word "elektron," meaning "amber,"  as amber was known to attract light objects after being rubbed.  The connection to excitement developed metaphorically, comparing the sudden jolt of electricity to the sudden surge of exhilaration.
