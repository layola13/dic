词源:
The word "customs" ultimately derives from the Old French word "custume," meaning "habit, custom," which itself comes from the Latin word "consuetudo," meaning "habit, custom, usage."  The meaning relating to the official department evolved from the concept of regulating and taxing goods according to established practices and laws.
