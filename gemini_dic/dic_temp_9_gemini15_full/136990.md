词源:
The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "spirited," which means full of energy and enthusiasm.  Therefore, "nonspirited" literally means "not spirited."  The root of "spirited" traces back to the Old English word "spirit," related to the Latin "spiritus," meaning breath or life force.
