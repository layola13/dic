词源:
The word "dishallow" is a combination of the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the verb "allow."  It evolved naturally from the existing word "allow" to express the opposite meaning.  The word's usage solidified over time as a clear and concise way to express the refusal to permit something.
