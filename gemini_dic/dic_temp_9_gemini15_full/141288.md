Therefore, it attempts to describe multiple aspects or qualities related to being outdoors or in the open air.  It lacks a formal definition and usage.|The park's numerous open-airishnesses, from its sprawling lawns to its shaded benches, made it ideal for relaxation.  公园的诸多露天特征，从广阔的草坪到遮荫的长椅，使其成为休闲的理想场所。|近义词：outdoor qualities, open-air features, aspects of open space|反义词：indoor characteristics, enclosed features|名词
