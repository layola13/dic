WORD ORIGIN->
The word "compare" comes from the Old French word "comparer," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "comparare," meaning "to liken, to compare."  "Com-" is a prefix meaning "together," and "parare" means "to make equal" or "to prepare."  Thus, the original sense involved bringing things together to assess their equality or similarity.
