词源:
The word "fum" derives from the Old French word "fumer," meaning "to smoke" or "to fume."  This, in turn, has roots in the Latin word "fumus," meaning "smoke."  The English word evolved from the process of "fumigation," which refers to the process of using smoke or fumes to disinfect or sterilize.
