WORD ORIGIN->

The word "mage" originates from the Old French word "mage," which in turn comes from the Late Latin word "magus."  The Late Latin word is derived from the Greek word "μάγος" (magos), referring to the priests of the Zoroastrian religion in ancient Persia.  These priests were known for their wisdom, knowledge, and often, their association with magic and astrology.  The word's evolution reflects the enduring connection between religious figures and the practice of magic or arcane knowledge.
