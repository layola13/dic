词源:  The term "pork barrel" originates from the 19th century.  Politicians would literally distribute meat from barrels to their constituents as a form of patronage.  Over time, the term evolved to describe the appropriation of government funds for projects of dubious merit, primarily intended to benefit the politician's own district or supporters.
