The word "chist" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please double-check your spelling.  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word, or a word with a similar meaning.

2. **It's a slang term or regional dialect word:**  If it's a slang term or used within a specific community, it would not be found in standard dictionaries.  More context is needed to understand its meaning and usage.

3. **It's a newly coined word:**  While unlikely, it's possible the word is very recent and hasn't yet been included in dictionaries.

To help me provide the analysis you need, please:

* **Provide more context:** Where did you encounter this word?  What was the sentence or situation?
* **Consider alternative spellings:** Are you sure of the spelling?  Try different spellings that sound similar.


Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.
