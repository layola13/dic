词源:  The word "lassitude" comes from the Old French word "lasseté," meaning "weariness" or "fatigue." This, in turn, derives from the Old French adjective "las," meaning "tired" or "weary," which has roots in the Vulgar Latin *lassus, possibly related to the Latin word "laxus," meaning "loose" or "slack."  The "-itude" suffix is a common Latinate suffix indicating a state or condition.
