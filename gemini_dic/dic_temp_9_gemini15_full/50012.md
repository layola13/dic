denoisers:/dɪˈnɔɪzərz/ | n. |降噪器，去噪器 |A denoiser is a system or algorithm designed to reduce or eliminate noise from a signal or image.  It's commonly used in audio processing, image processing, and other fields to improve the clarity and quality of data. |Example:  Advanced denoisers are used in modern cameras to produce clearer images in low-light conditions.  先进的降噪器用于现代相机，以在低光照条件下产生更清晰的图像。|近义词：noise reducer, noise filter |反义词：noise amplifier, noise introducer |名词


USAGE->
