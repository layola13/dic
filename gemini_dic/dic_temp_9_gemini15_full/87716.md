hexatomic:/ˌhɛksəˈætɒmɪk/ | adj. |六原子的|Containing six atoms.  This term is primarily used in chemistry to describe molecules or ions composed of six atoms.  For example, a hexatomic molecule might consist of six atoms of the same element or a combination of different elements.  |Example:  Ozone (O3) is not hexatomic; it is triatomic.  A molecule of sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is hexatomic.|近义词: six-atom (less common)|反义词: monatomic, diatomic, triatomic, etc.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The molecule is hexatomic. = 这个分子是六原子的。
This compound contains a hexatomic ion. = 此化合物包含一个六原子离子。


一般过去时:
The scientist identified the hexatomic structure. = 科学家鉴定了六原子结构。
The analysis showed the substance to be hexatomic. = 分析表明该物质是六原子的。


现在完成时:
We have confirmed the molecule is hexatomic. = 我们已经确认该分子是六原子的。
Researchers have discovered several new hexatomic compounds. = 研究人员已经发现了数种新的六原子化合物。


过去完成时:
They had already determined the compound was hexatomic before the experiment. = 他们在实验之前就已经确定该化合物是六原子的。
Scientists had previously believed it to be pentaatomic, but it was later shown to be hexatomic. = 科学家们之前认为它是五原子的，但后来证明它是六原子的。


将来时:
We will analyze the sample to determine if it is hexatomic. = 我们将分析样品以确定它是否是六原子的。
The research will show that many molecules are hexatomic. = 研究将表明许多分子是六原子的。


虚拟语气:
If the molecule were hexatomic, it would exhibit different properties. = 如果分子是六原子的，它将表现出不同的性质。
I wish I had known that the compound was hexatomic earlier. = 我真希望我早点知道该化合物是六原子的。


被动语态:
The hexatomic structure was confirmed by spectroscopy. = 六原子结构通过光谱法得到了证实。
The composition of the molecule was determined to be hexatomic. = 分子的组成被确定为六原子。


疑问句:
Is the molecule hexatomic? = 这个分子是六原子的吗？
Are all molecules in this sample hexatomic? = 此样本中的所有分子都是六原子的吗？


否定句:
The molecule is not hexatomic; it's pentaatomic. = 该分子不是六原子的；它是五原子的。
The results showed that the substance was not hexatomic. = 结果表明该物质不是六原子的。



PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "hexatomic" as it's a highly technical term.  Phrases would involve describing molecules or structures which *are* hexatomic.  Examples would need to be constructed based on specific chemical contexts.  For example:  "a hexatomic sulfur fluoride molecule", "analysis of hexatomic structures", "the properties of hexatomic molecules".
