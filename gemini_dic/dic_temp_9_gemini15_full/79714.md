glucosinolate: /ˌɡluːkoʊˈsɪnoʊleɪt/ | n. | 芥子油苷 | A naturally occurring sulfur-containing compound found in plants of the family Brassicaceae (crucifers), such as cabbage, broccoli, and mustard.  Glucosinolates are broken down by the enzyme myrosinase to produce various bioactive compounds, some of which have health benefits, others are toxic. |  The levels of glucosinolates in broccoli vary depending on the cultivar and growing conditions. | 近义词: thioglucoside | 反义词:  (no direct antonym, but compounds with opposite biological effects could be considered)
