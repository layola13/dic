orogenically:/ˌɔːrəˈdʒɛnɪkli/| adv.|造山作用地；造山运动地 | Relating to or resulting from orogeny (mountain building).  The term describes processes, features, or events associated with the formation of mountains through tectonic plate movements. | Example: The Himalayas were orogenically formed by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates. 喜马拉雅山是由印度板块和欧亚板块碰撞而形成的。 |近义词: tectonically, geologically |反义词:平原地平地(planely)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The rocks are orogenically deformed. = 这些岩石发生了造山变形。
This area is orogenically active. = 这个地区地质活动活跃。


一般过去时:
The mountain range was orogenically uplifted millions of years ago. = 这座山脉几百万年前因造山运动而隆起。
The rocks were orogenically compressed during the collision. = 岩石在碰撞过程中受到造山挤压。


现在完成时:
These formations have been orogenically modified over time. = 这些地层随着时间的推移发生了造山改造。
The landscape has been significantly altered by orogenic processes. = 地貌因造山过程而发生了显著变化。


过去完成时:
The fault had been orogenically reactivated before the earthquake. = 在地震发生之前，断层已经因造山运动而重新活动。
The sedimentary layers had been intensely folded orogenically. = 沉积层曾经历过强烈的造山褶皱。


将来时:
This region will likely experience further orogenic activity. = 这个地区很可能会经历进一步的造山活动。
The model predicts that the mountains will continue to grow orogenically. = 模型预测山脉将继续造山生长。


虚拟语气:
If the plates continued to converge, the mountains would be orogenically higher. = 如果板块继续汇聚，山脉的造山高度将会更高。
It is hypothesized that if the collision hadn't occurred, the region wouldn't be orogenically active. = 假设碰撞没有发生，该地区就不会有造山活动。


被动语态:
The rock structures were orogenically shaped by immense pressure. = 岩石结构因巨大的压力而被造山塑造。
The area is believed to have been orogenically influenced by past tectonic events. = 人们认为该地区受到了过去构造事件的造山影响。


疑问句:
Were these folds orogenically formed? = 这些褶皱是造山形成的吗？
Is this region currently undergoing significant orogenic activity? = 这个地区目前正在经历显著的造山活动吗？


否定句:
The plains were not orogenically formed; they are sedimentary. = 平原不是造山形成的；它们是沉积性的。
These features are not directly related to orogenic processes. = 这些特征与造山过程没有直接关系。


PHRASE->
orogenically induced = 造山诱发的
orogenically active = 造山活动活跃的
orogenically thickened = 造山增厚的
orogenically deformed = 造山变形的
orogenically uplifted = 造山隆起的


词源:
From *orogeny* + *-ically*.  *Orogeny* itself comes from Greek *oros* (mountain) + *genesis* (origin, creation).  Therefore, *orogenically* literally means "in a manner relating to mountain-building."
