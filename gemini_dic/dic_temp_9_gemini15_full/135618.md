/ˌnɒnˌpræktɪkəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. |不可行性，不切实际 |The nonpracticabilities of the plan were quickly apparent.  该计划的不可行性很快就显现出来了。|近义词：impracticabilities, infeasibilities |反义词：feasibility, practicability


This word is not a standard English word. It's a very rare and artificially constructed word, formed by adding the prefix "non-" to "practicabilities".  Let's break down the components:

* **non-**: A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of".
* **practicability**:  /ˌpræktɪkəˈbɪləti/ | n. |可行性，实用性 |The practicability of the scheme is doubtful.  该计划的可行性令人怀疑。|近义词：feasibility, workability |反义词：infeasibility, impossibility

Therefore, "nonpracticabilities" would theoretically refer to the aspects or instances of something being *not* practical or feasible. However, due to its artificial nature, it's unlikely to be encountered in standard English texts or conversations.  It's more likely to appear in highly specialized or academic contexts, perhaps as a technical term coined for a specific purpose.

Because it's not a standard word, providing example sentences in various tenses and grammatical constructions would be artificial and misleading.  The word itself is the issue; its use would require careful contextual explanation.  Standard alternatives would always be preferable.
