polymerizability: /ˌpɑːlɪmərɪˈzeɪbɪləti/ | n. | 聚合性，可聚合性 | The ability of a substance to undergo polymerization.  It refers to the ease and extent to which a monomer or a mixture of monomers can be converted into a polymer.  Factors influencing polymerizability include the chemical structure of the monomer, reaction conditions (temperature, pressure, catalysts), and the presence of inhibitors. | Example: The high polymerizability of styrene allows for the production of polystyrene plastics on a large scale.  高聚合性的苯乙烯使得大规模生产聚苯乙烯塑料成为可能。 The low polymerizability of this monomer hindered the development of a commercially viable polymer.  这种单体的低聚合性阻碍了商业上可行的聚合物的开发。 | 近义词: polymerizability tendency, reactivity (in polymerization context) | 反义词: non-polymerizability, inability to polymerize
