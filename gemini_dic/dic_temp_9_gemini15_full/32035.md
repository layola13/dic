词源:
The word "cherish" ultimately derives from the Old French word "cherir," meaning "to love dearly," "to hold dear," or "to caress."  "Cherir" itself has roots in the Vulgar Latin word *carīre, which is related to the Latin word "carus," meaning "dear," "beloved," or "costly."  Therefore, the core meaning of "cherish" has always been associated with deep affection and value.
