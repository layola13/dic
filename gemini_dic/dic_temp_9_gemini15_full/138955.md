词源:
The word "nuzzle" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "noselen," meaning "to rub the nose."  This, in turn, likely comes from the Old English word "nosu," meaning "nose," combined with a verb suffix indicating a repetitive or habitual action.  The modern spelling and meaning have evolved over time.
