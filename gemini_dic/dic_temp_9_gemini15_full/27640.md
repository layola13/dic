candelas:/kænˈdɛləz/| n.|坎德拉（发光强度单位）|A candela (cd) is the SI unit of luminous intensity.  It is a measure of the power of a light source in a particular direction. One candela is defined by the light emitted by a certain type of source under specific conditions.|The candle's light intensity was measured in candelas.|luminous intensity, light intensity|darkness, shadow|名词


USAGE->
