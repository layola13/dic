词源:
The word "handover" is a compound word formed from "hand" and "over."  "Hand" refers to the act of giving something, and "over" indicates the direction of the transfer, suggesting a complete and final passing of something.  Its etymology therefore points to a simple, direct action of physical transfer, which has evolved to encompass broader meanings of responsibility and control.
