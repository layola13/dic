USAGE->
This word is largely obsolete and doesn't have common usage across various tenses or grammatical structures.  Therefore, providing examples for all tenses would be artificial and misleading.  The word's usage is primarily limited to descriptive contexts in paleontology or specialized studies of mollusks.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "mulloid".  The word itself is too specialized for common phrasal usage.
