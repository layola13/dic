/ˌɪntərˈtræfɪks/ | n. |交互交通，互相干扰的交通 |The term "intertraffics" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism, possibly formed by combining "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and "traffics" (referring to the movement of people or vehicles).  Its meaning would likely be related to the interaction or interference between different traffic flows or systems.  |Example: (Hypothetical)  The new traffic management system aims to reduce intertraffics between the highway and city streets.  新的交通管理系统旨在减少高速公路和城市街道之间的交通干扰。|近义词:traffic interaction, traffic interference, cross-traffic |反义词:  (No direct antonym, but concepts like "unobstructed traffic flow" or "independent traffic systems" could be considered opposites)|名词
