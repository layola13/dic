hiya:/ˈhaɪə/| int.|嘿，你好|A casual and informal greeting, similar to "hi" or "hey". Often used in spoken English, particularly in Britain.  |Hiya, mate! How's it going?  嘿，伙计！最近怎么样？|hi, hey, hello|goodbye, farewell|interjection


USAGE->
(Hiya is an interjection and doesn't have verb conjugations like the example word "what".  The following section is irrelevant to the word "hiya" and is therefore omitted.)


PHRASE->
(Phrases using "hiya" are limited due to its nature as a simple greeting. Examples would focus on adding words for context, not grammatical transformations of "hiya" itself.)

Hiya there! = 嘿，你好！
Hiya, love! = 嘿，亲爱的！
Hiya, sport! = 嘿，伙计！
See ya, hiya! = 再见，嘿！ (A combination of farewell and greeting, showing informality)
Hiya to you too! = 你好！
