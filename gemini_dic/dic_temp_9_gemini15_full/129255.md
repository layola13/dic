nodal:/ˈnoʊdəl/| adj.|节点的；枢纽的；关键的| Relating to or situated at a node.  A node is a point where things intersect or branch out.  The word often appears in contexts involving networks, systems, or structures.  |例句：The nodal point of the network is the main server.  这个网络的节点是主服务器。
The nodal points of the bridge are strategically designed to withstand stress. 桥梁的节点经过精心设计以承受压力。|近义词：central, pivotal, key|反义词：peripheral, marginal


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The nodal point controls the entire system. = 节点控制整个系统。
This nodal structure is highly efficient. = 这种节点结构非常高效。

一般过去时:
The nodal point failed yesterday. = 节点昨天失效了。
The engineers analyzed the nodal structure of the bridge. = 工程师们分析了桥梁的节点结构。

现在完成时:
They have identified the key nodal points in the network. = 他们已经确定了网络中的关键节点。
We have improved the stability of the nodal connections. = 我们已经提高了节点连接的稳定性。

过去完成时:
The system had already failed before the nodal point malfunctioned. = 在节点出现故障之前，系统就已经失效了。
The engineers had studied the nodal structure extensively before starting construction. = 工程师们在开始施工前已经广泛研究了节点结构。

将来时:
They will analyze the nodal points after the test. = 他们将在测试后分析节点。
The new system will have improved nodal connections. = 新系统将具有改进的节点连接。

虚拟语气:
If the nodal point were stronger, the system would be more stable. = 如果节点更强，系统将更稳定。
I wish the nodal connections were more reliable. = 我希望节点连接更可靠。

被动语态:
The system is controlled by the nodal point. = 系统由节点控制。
The nodal structure was carefully designed by the engineers. = 节点结构由工程师们精心设计。

疑问句:
Where is the main nodal point located? = 主节点位于何处？
What are the critical nodal points in this design? = 此设计中的关键节点是什么？

否定句:
The system does not have redundant nodal points. = 系统没有冗余节点。
The nodal structure was not properly reinforced. = 节点结构没有得到适当的加固。


PHRASE->
nodal analysis = 节点分析
nodal voltage = 节点电压
nodal plane = 节点平面
nodal line = 节点线
nodal region = 节点区域
