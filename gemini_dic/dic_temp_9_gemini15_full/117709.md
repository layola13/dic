词源:
The word "melancholian" is derived from the older word "melancholy," which has its roots in the Greek words *melas* (μέλας), meaning "black," and *kholē* (χολή), meaning "bile."  Ancient Greek physicians believed that an imbalance of the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) caused various illnesses, and an excess of black bile was thought to be the cause of melancholy.  The "-ian" suffix transforms the noun "melancholy" into an adjective, describing something or someone possessing the quality of melancholy.
