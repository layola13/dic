词源:
The word "landline" is a compound word.  "Land" refers to the fixed location of the telephone connection, contrasting with the mobility of cellular phones. "Line" refers to the telephone line itself, the physical connection providing the service.  The combination therefore clearly indicates a telephone service that is fixed to a specific location.
