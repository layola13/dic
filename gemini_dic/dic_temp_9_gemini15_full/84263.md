PHRASE->
There are no common set phrases specifically using "half-subdued".  The word is used descriptively rather than in fixed expressions.  However, we can illustrate its use with phrases like:

a half-subdued whisper

词源:
The word is a combination of "half" (meaning one of two equal parts) and "subdued" (from the Old French "sobsduire," meaning to overcome, conquer, or subject).  "Subdued" itself evolved from the Latin "subducere," meaning "to draw away, withdraw."  Therefore, "half-subdued" describes something partially drawn away, withdrawn, or suppressed.
