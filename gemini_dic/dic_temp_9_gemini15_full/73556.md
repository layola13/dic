词源:

The word comes from the Old French *forestaller*, meaning "to hinder, obstruct," ultimately deriving from the prefix *for-* (meaning "before" or "against") and the verb *estaler* ("to obstruct").  The original sense was to stop someone from getting to market first to sell their goods; hence the modern sense of preventing something, or manipulating markets.
