词源:
The word "short-handedness" is a compound word derived from "short-handed" + "-ness".

"Short-handed" itself combines "short" (meaning lacking or deficient) and "handed" (referring to the number of people available to work).  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "short-handed" into a noun, indicating the state or quality of being short-handed.  The etymology traces back to the Old English word "sceort" (short) and the use of "hand" to represent workforce or personnel, a common figurative usage.
