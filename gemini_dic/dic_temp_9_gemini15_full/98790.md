词源:
The word "integrating" comes from the verb "integrate," which originates from the Latin word "integrare," meaning "to make whole" or "to restore."  The prefix "in-" means "in" or "into," and the root "-tegrare" is related to the word "integer," meaning "whole" or "complete."  Therefore, the core meaning of "integrate" reflects the act of making something whole or complete by bringing together its parts.
