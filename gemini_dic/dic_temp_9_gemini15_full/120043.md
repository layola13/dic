被动语态:
The data was processed in milliseconds by the powerful server.  强大的服务器以毫秒为单位处理了数据。
The results were displayed in milliseconds after the calculation was completed. 计算完成后，结果在几毫秒内显示出来。


疑问句:
How many milliseconds does it take to complete the process? 完成这个过程需要多少毫秒？
Can the system respond within milliseconds? 系统能在毫秒内响应吗？


否定句:
The system did not respond within the required milliseconds. 系统没有在规定的毫秒内响应。
