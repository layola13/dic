词源:  The word is a compound adjective formed from "horse" and the past participle "drawn," which itself comes from the verb "draw."  "Horse" has Germanic origins (Old English *hors), while "drawn" traces back to the Old English verb *drāgan, meaning "to pull" or "to drag."  Therefore, the meaning literally conveys something "pulled by a horse."


用法说明:

The adjective "horse-drawn" is primarily used to describe vehicles, equipment, or other objects that are propelled by horses.  It evokes a sense of a bygone era and often implies a slower, more traditional mode of transportation or operation.  It is typically used attributively (before the noun it modifies).
