词源:
The word "choreographed" comes from the noun "choreography," which itself originates from the Greek words "choreia" (χορεία), meaning "dance," and "graphein" (γράφειν), meaning "to write."  Therefore, "choreography" literally means "dance writing," referring to the notation and planning of dance movements.  "Choreographed" is the past participle of the verb "choreograph," which developed as a natural extension of the noun.
