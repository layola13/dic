nonsingularity:/ˌnɒnsɪŋɡjuˈlærəti/ | adj. | 非奇异性，非单一性 | The property of not being singular;  in linear algebra, a nonsingular matrix is a square matrix that has a multiplicative inverse. In other contexts, it can refer to a system or phenomenon that lacks a unique or exceptional point or characteristic. | Example: The nonsingularity of the matrix ensures the existence of a unique solution to the system of equations.  非奇异矩阵保证了方程组存在唯一解。  The nonsingularity of the data is crucial for the success of the algorithm. 数据的非奇异性对于算法的成功至关重要。| 近义词：regularity, invertibility | 反义词：singularity, degeneracy
