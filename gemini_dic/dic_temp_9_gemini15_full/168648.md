procommutation: /ˌproʊkɒmjuˈteɪʃən/ | n. |预换向；预先换向|The process of changing the commutation of a machine before it is actually switched on.  It's a technique used in some electrical machines to improve performance or control.  This term is primarily used in the context of electrical engineering, specifically relating to the control and operation of electrical motors and generators.  |The engineers implemented a procommutation strategy to reduce sparking in the motor.|近义词:pre-commutation, advanced commutation|反义词:None readily available.  The antonym would describe a process of *not* pre-setting the commutation, which is not a standard term.
