词源:

The word "scantling" originates from the Old French "escantilon," meaning "pattern," "template," or "sample."  This reflects its early use in referring to a pattern or model. Over time, the meaning shifted to include the small pieces of timber used in construction, likely because these pieces were often cut according to a pattern or template.
