mezzotints:/ˈmɛzəˌtɪnts/| n.|凹版印刷术；凹版画|A mezzotint is a kind of printmaking process, and also the print produced by it, that uses a special kind of plate to create rich tones and deep blacks.  The process involves roughening the entire surface of a metal plate and then selectively smoothing areas to control the amount of ink held. This results in a wide range of tones, from very dark to very light, capable of producing subtle gradations of light and shadow.|Example: The museum displayed a stunning collection of 18th-century mezzotints.|近义词：engraving, etching|反义词：relief print
