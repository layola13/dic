reactance:/riˈæktəns/ | n. | 电抗；阻抗；反应性 | The opposition to the flow of alternating current in an electrical circuit, caused by inductance or capacitance.  It is measured in ohms. |  The reactance of the capacitor limited the current flow.  电容的电抗限制了电流的流动。| Impedance, opposition |  Conductance |  名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The reactance of this circuit is high. = 这个电路的电抗很高。
What is the reactance of the inductor? = 电感器的电抗是多少？


一般过去时:
The reactance was too high for the application. = 电抗对于该应用来说太高了。
The engineer calculated the reactance of the system. = 工程师计算了系统的电抗。


现在完成时:
They have measured the reactance several times. = 他们已经测量了几次电抗。
We have determined that the high reactance is the problem. = 我们已经确定高电抗是问题所在。


过去完成时:
The technician had already calculated the reactance before the meeting. = 技术人员在会议之前已经计算出电抗了。
The engineers had underestimated the reactance of the component. = 工程师低估了组件的电抗。


将来时:
We will measure the reactance tomorrow. = 我们明天将测量电抗。
The system's reactance will increase with frequency. = 系统的电抗将随着频率的增加而增加。


虚拟语气:
If the reactance were lower, the circuit would perform better. = 如果电抗更低，电路的性能将会更好。
I wish the reactance was less significant in this design. = 我希望在这个设计中电抗的影响不那么显著。


被动语态:
The reactance was calculated using a complex formula. = 电抗是用一个复杂的公式计算出来的。
The reactance is being measured by the technician. = 电抗正在由技术人员测量。


疑问句:
What is the total reactance of the circuit? = 电路的总电抗是多少？
How is the reactance calculated in this case? = 在这种情况下，电抗是如何计算的？


否定句:
The reactance is not significant in this particular application. = 在这个特定的应用中，电抗并不显著。
The reactance did not affect the performance of the system. = 电抗没有影响系统的性能。


PHRASE->
capacitive reactance: 电容抗
