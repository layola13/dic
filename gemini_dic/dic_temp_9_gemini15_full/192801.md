词源:
The word "seamlessness" is derived from "seamless," which combines "seam" (a line of junction, typically between pieces of fabric) with the suffix "-less" (meaning "without").  Therefore, "seamless" literally means "without a seam," and "seamlessness" describes the state or quality of being without seams or interruptions.
