The word "commonition" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible there's a misspelling or it's a very obscure or archaic word.  If you could provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer suggestions.
