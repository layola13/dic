词源:
The word "rushed" comes from the verb "rush," which has Old English and Old Norse roots.  The Old English word *hrūsan meant "to move swiftly or violently,"  while the Old Norse word *hrūsa had a similar meaning.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the sense of hurried or careless action.
