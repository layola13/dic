词源:

The word "deuced" originates from the word "devil," ultimately derived from the Old French "diable" and the Latin "diabolus."  The use of "devil" as an intensifier has a long history in English, often appearing in euphemistic forms like "deuced" to avoid direct profanity.  The transformation from "devil" to "deuced" likely involved a process of weakening and euphemization.


用法说明:


"Deuced" is an intensifying adjective used informally to emphasize a quality or statement. It carries a slightly old-fashioned and somewhat humorous tone, often implying a mild exasperation or amusement.  It's rarely used in formal writing.  It is generally considered a less offensive alternative to stronger expletives.

The word is typically used before an adjective or adverb.


例句：

That's a deucedly difficult problem.  那是一个非常困难的问题。

He's a deuced good golfer. 他是一个非常棒的高尔夫球手。
