photobacterium:/ˌfoʊtoʊbækˈtɪəriəm/| n. |发光细菌|A bacterium that produces light, often found in marine environments.  These bacteria use a process called bioluminescence to create light.  They are often symbiotic with other organisms. |Example:  Many deep-sea creatures have symbiotic relationships with *photobacterium*, which provide them with light for attracting prey or mates.  许多深海生物与*发光细菌*有共生关系，*发光细菌*为它们提供吸引猎物或配偶的光。|近义词:bioluminescent bacterium|反义词:non-luminescent bacterium|名词
