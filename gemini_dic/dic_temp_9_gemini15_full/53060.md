dioptrics: /ˌdaɪˈɒptrɪks/ | n. | 屈光学 | The branch of optics dealing with the refraction of light and the formation of images by lenses and other optical systems.  It studies how light bends when passing from one medium to another, and how this bending is used to create images.  | Example:  He studied dioptrics to understand how lenses work. 他学习屈光学来了解透镜的工作原理。 | 近义词: refractive optics | 反义词:  (no direct antonym, but related concepts like catoptrics which deals with reflection could be considered contrasting) | 名词
