/ˈhaɪdraɪoʊt/ | n. |氢化物|A hydride is a chemical compound that contains a hydrogen atom.  Hydrides are formed when hydrogen reacts with other elements, typically metals or metalloids.  The hydrogen atom can either donate its electron to become a positively charged ion (H+), accept an electron to become a negatively charged ion (H-), or share electrons to form a covalent bond.| Example: Sodium hydride (NaH) is a common example of a saline hydride.  | 近义词:  hydrogen compound | 反义词:  (No direct antonym,  but compounds without hydrogen could be considered opposite in terms of composition) | 名词
