/ˌraɪzəʊˈɡæn/ | n. | 根瘤菌 | Rhizogan refers to a type of bacteria, specifically rhizobia, that form symbiotic relationships with the roots of leguminous plants. These bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen into forms usable by the plants, enriching the soil and promoting plant growth.  The term might also be used in a broader context to refer to any organism that exhibits rhizogenesis (root formation). However, it is not a widely used or standardized term, and its usage is likely more common in specific research contexts or within particular scientific communities. There are no readily available synonyms or antonyms for "rhizogan" as it isn't a widely established scientific term.  Instead, more precise terms like "rhizobia," "nitrogen-fixing bacteria," or "nodule bacteria" would be used depending on the specific context.


例句：

Researchers are exploring new methods to enhance the activity of rhizogan in agricultural systems. = 研究人员正在探索提高农业系统中根瘤菌活性的新方法。
