self-thinning:/ˈsɛlfˌθɪnɪŋ/| n.|自疏|The process by which plants of the same species, grown at high density, reduce their own density through mortality. This is primarily due to competition for resources like light, water, and nutrients.|例句：Self-thinning is a common phenomenon in plant populations, leading to a negative relationship between plant density and individual plant size. 自疏是植物种群中的一种常见现象，导致植物密度与单个植物大小之间呈负相关关系。|近义词：density-dependent mortality, competitive mortality|反义词：self-enhancement
