heptene:/ˈhɛpˌtiːn/| n. |庚烯|Heptene refers to any of the several isomers of a seven-carbon alkene hydrocarbon with the general formula C₇H₁₄.  These isomers differ in the position of the double bond and/or the arrangement of the carbon atoms (straight chain or branched).  They are colorless liquids with characteristic alkene reactivity. |例句：Several heptene isomers are used in the production of various chemicals. 几种庚烯异构体用于生产各种化学品。|近义词：heptylene|反义词：无
