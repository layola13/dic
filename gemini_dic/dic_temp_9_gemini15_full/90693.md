词源:
The word "humdrum" likely originated in the 17th century.  The etymology is uncertain, but it’s possibly a combination of "hum" (a low, monotonous sound) and "drum" (a repetitive sound).  The sense of monotony and dullness implied by the combination of these sounds gave rise to its current meaning.
