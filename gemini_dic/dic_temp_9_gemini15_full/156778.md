词源:

Derived from "Pietism," a 17th-century movement in Protestantism emphasizing personal piety and devotion.  The suffix "-ical" transforms the noun into an adjective.  The word reflects the later, sometimes negative, connotations associated with Pietism – namely, an outward show of piety that might mask a lack of genuine faith.
