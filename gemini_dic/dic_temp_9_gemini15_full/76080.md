词源：The word's origin is uncertain, but it's believed to have originated in Australia in the early 20th century, possibly connected to a water cart owned by a man named Furphy.  The water cart became a gathering place for soldiers during World War I, where many stories and rumours were shared. Over time, "furphy" became associated with these often unfounded tales.  The exact etymology remains debated.
