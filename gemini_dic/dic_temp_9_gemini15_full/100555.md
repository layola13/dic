USAGE->
This word is quite niche and doesn't have a wide range of grammatical usages like common verbs or nouns.  Its usage is primarily limited to its noun form, describing an action.  Therefore, providing examples across tenses is not applicable.  The word itself is a relatively new coinage, not found in standard dictionaries, so traditional grammatical analysis is not readily available.

PHRASE->
There are no established or common phrases directly using "interwhistling."  The word itself functions as a complete concept.
