It typically describes sediments, rocks, or other geological features formed from the weathering and erosion of pre-existing rocks.|The beach sand was primarily lithogenous, composed of quartz grains eroded from nearby mountains.  The lithogenous deposits on the ocean floor are rich in minerals.|近义词：petrogenous|反义词：biogenous, hydrogenous
