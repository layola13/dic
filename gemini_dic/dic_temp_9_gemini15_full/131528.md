WORD ORIGIN->
The word is formed by combining several morphemes:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of."
* **comical**: An adjective meaning "funny" or "humorous."  Originates from "comedy," ultimately from Greek "kōmōidia" (a form of drama).
* **-ness**: A suffix used to form abstract nouns indicating a quality, state, or condition.  This suffix indicates the state or quality of being comical.  Adding "non-" negates this quality.
* **-es**: A plural marker for nouns.

Therefore, "noncomicalnesses" refers to the multiple instances or aspects of a lack of humor or comicality.
