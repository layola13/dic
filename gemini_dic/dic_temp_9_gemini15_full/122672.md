modulation:/ˌmɒdjuˈleɪʃən/ /ˌmɑːdʒəˈleɪʃən/ | n. | 调制；调节；变调 | The process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, such as amplitude, frequency, or phase, with a modulating signal that typically carries information.  This is used in radio transmission, music, and other fields to transmit information or create different sounds. | Example:  Amplitude modulation (AM) is a common technique used in radio broadcasting.  = 幅度调制（AM）是广播中常用的技术。

The subtle modulation of her voice conveyed her doubt. = 她声音细微的调制传达了她的怀疑。


近义词：adjustment, variation, alteration | 反义词：constancy, uniformity
