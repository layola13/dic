词源:
The word "disguising" comes from the Old French word "deguiser," which means "to disguise."  The prefix "dis-" indicates negation or reversal, while the root "guise" (from Old French "guise") relates to appearance or manner.  Therefore, "disguising" literally means "to put out of guise" or "to change one's appearance."
