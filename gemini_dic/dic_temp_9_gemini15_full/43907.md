The word "creux" is not an English word.  It's a French word.  Therefore, providing an analysis in the requested format for an English word is impossible.  To provide a similar analysis, I would need an English word as input.


If you would like an analysis of the *French* word "creux", I can provide that instead.  Please let me know.
