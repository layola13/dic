The word "proses" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:** Perhaps you meant "process,"  "prose," or a word from another language.

2. **It's a neologism or technical term:**  It might be a newly coined word or a term specific to a certain field (e.g., a technical jargon).  If this is the case, please provide more context.


If you intended to ask about "process" or "prose", please let me know and I will provide the requested analysis.
