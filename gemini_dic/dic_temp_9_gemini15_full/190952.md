Etymology:

The word "scalawag" has an uncertain etymology, but the most widely accepted theory connects it to a combination of Scottish and Irish dialect words.  The most probable origin is a combination of "scald," meaning "to scald" (to burn with hot liquid), and "wag," meaning "a mischievous person" (or "to wag" meaning "to move quickly or playfully").  This suggests an image of someone who is both a bit wild and burns with a mischievous energy.  Another possibility links it to the Gaelic word "sgallag," meaning "a ragged fellow," which aligns with the connotation of a somewhat unkempt or unruly child.  Its usage increased significantly during the Reconstruction era in the United States, often used to describe unscrupulous politicians.
