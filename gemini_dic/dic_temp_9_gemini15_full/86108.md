词源:
The word "heartbeat" is a compound word formed from "heart" and "beat."  "Heart" originates from Old English *heorte,  related to Old High German herza, meaning "heart." "Beat" comes from Old English *beatan, meaning "to strike, beat."  Therefore, "heartbeat" literally means the rhythmic striking or beating of the heart.
