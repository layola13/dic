词源:The word "fulsomeness" originates from the Middle English word "fulsom," meaning "foul, loathsome, disgusting," derived from Old English "ful" (foul) + "sum" (some, a suffix indicating a quality).  Over time, the meaning shifted to describe excessive or distasteful displays of emotion, particularly in the context of flattery.  The "-ness" suffix adds the quality of being "full of" or having the characteristic of.
