词源:  The word "potestate" comes from the Late Latin word *potestas*, meaning "power," "authority," or "dominion."  This in turn derives from the Latin verb *posse*, meaning "to be able."  The -ate suffix indicates a noun of agency or state.  Therefore, "potestate" literally signifies "the state of having power" or "the entity possessing power."
