nitroxyl:/ˈnaɪtrɒksɪl/ | n. | 一氧化氮阴离子 | Nitroxyl is the chemical name for the nitrogen monoxide anion, HNO. It is a potent biological signaling molecule with diverse effects on the cardiovascular, nervous, and immune systems.  It differs from nitric oxide (NO) in its chemical properties and biological effects. | Example:  Research on nitroxyl's role in regulating blood pressure is ongoing.  研究一氧化氮阴离子在调节血压中的作用正在进行中。 | 近义词: HNO (chemical formula), nitrogen monoxide anion | 反义词:  None directly, but its effects can be contrasted with those of other signaling molecules.
