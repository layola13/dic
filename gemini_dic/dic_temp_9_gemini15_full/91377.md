PHRASE->
(This word is less likely to be used in phrases.  Phrases would usually describe the process or result, rather than the adjective itself.)  Instead of phrases with "hydrosulphureted," consider phrases describing the process like "hydrogen sulfide treatment,"  "sulfidation," or "sulfurization."

Examples:

hydrogen sulfide treatment of metals 金属的硫化氢处理
sulfidation process 硫化过程
sulfurization reaction 硫化反应
effect of sulfurization 硫化的影响
analysis of sulfidation products 硫化产物分析


词源:

* **hydro-**:  From Greek *ὕδωρ* (hydōr), meaning "water."  Indicates a connection to water or hydrogen.
* **sulphur-**: From Latin *sulphur* (sulfur), meaning "sulfur."
* **-ated**: A suffix indicating a chemical process or state of being treated with something.  In this case, it implies a chemical reaction involving sulfur.

Therefore, "hydrosulphureted" means "treated with or containing hydrogen sulfide."
