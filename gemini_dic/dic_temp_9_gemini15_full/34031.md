词源:
The word "citrine" comes from the Old French word "citrin," meaning "lemon-colored," which in turn derives from the Latin word "citreus," also meaning "lemon-colored."  The association is due to the gemstone's characteristic yellow-to-orange hue, reminiscent of lemons or citrons (a type of citrus fruit).
