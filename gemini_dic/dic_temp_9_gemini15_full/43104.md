近义词：fop, dandy, narcissist, show-off, peacock

反义词：humble, modest, unassuming


词源：The word derives from the Middle English "cokkescomb," a combination of "cok" (rooster) and "comb" (the fleshy crest on a rooster's head). The association with vanity comes from the rooster's showy crest. The figurative meaning transferred to a vain person due to the visual similarity between the rooster's comb and the ostentatious display of a conceited individual.
