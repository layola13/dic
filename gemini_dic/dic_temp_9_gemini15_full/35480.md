词源:  The word "coachwork" is a compound word.  "Coach" originally referred to a large, horse-drawn carriage, often luxurious.  The "-work" suffix denotes the craft or product of making something. Thus, "coachwork" literally means the "work of making coach bodies."  The term evolved to encompass the bodywork of automobiles, retaining the connotation of high quality and craftsmanship associated with the original horse-drawn coaches.
