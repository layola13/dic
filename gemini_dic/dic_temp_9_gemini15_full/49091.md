deifical: /daɪˈfɪkəl/ | adj. | 神圣的；神化的 |  The word "deifical" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a very rare neologism (newly coined word).  It seems to be intended to mean something relating to deification or making something godlike.  However, without a clear established definition and usage, providing detailed analysis, examples, synonyms, and antonyms is impossible.  There's no entry in standard dictionaries.


To clarify, if the intended word was "deific," then the analysis would be different:


deific: /dɪˈɪfɪk/ | adj. | 神性的；神圣的；与神有关的 | Relating to or characteristic of a god or gods; divine.  It implies a quality or nature associated with a deity.
