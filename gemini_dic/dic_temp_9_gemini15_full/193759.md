self-cultures: /ˈsɛlf ˈkʌltʃərz/ | n. | 自我文化；个人文化 |  The term "self-cultures" refers to the unique cultural practices, beliefs, values, and behaviors that an individual develops and maintains, often shaped by personal experiences, family background, and social interactions, distinct from broader societal or group cultures.
