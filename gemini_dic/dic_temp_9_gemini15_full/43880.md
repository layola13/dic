词源:

The adverb "crestfallenly" is derived from the adjective "crestfallen," which itself originates from the now-archaic imagery of a bird with its crest (a tuft of feathers on its head) fallen or lowered.  This visual metaphor perfectly captures the feeling of dejection and low spirits.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating manner or way.  The word's origins reflect a long-standing association between lowered posture and feelings of sadness or defeat.
