compressibility:/ˌkɒmpresəˈbɪləti/ /ˌkɑːmprɛsəˈbɪləti/ | n. |可压缩性，压缩率 | The ability of a substance to be compressed under pressure.  It refers to the relative volume change of a substance in response to a change in pressure.  | Example: The compressibility of gases is much higher than that of liquids or solids.  气体的可压缩性远高于液体或固体。

The compressibility of the foam makes it ideal for cushioning.  泡沫的可压缩性使其成为理想的缓冲材料。|近义词：compressibility factor,  malleability (in the context of solids)|反义词：incompressibility

词源:
From "compress" + "-ibility," a suffix indicating capacity or capability.  "Compress" itself comes from the Latin "comprimere," meaning "to press together," from "com-" (together) + "premere" (to press).
