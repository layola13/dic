词源:

The word "league" comes from the Old French word "lieue," meaning "a league" (a measure of distance, approximately three miles).  This ultimately derives from the Vulgar Latin *leuca, from the Gaulish *leukā.  The meaning shifted from a unit of distance to an association of people or groups over time, likely due to the concept of leagues covering a certain geographical area.
