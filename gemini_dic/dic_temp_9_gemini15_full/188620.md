The word "rumest" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or regional dialect.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide assistance, I need clarification on the intended word or context in which you encountered "rumest."
