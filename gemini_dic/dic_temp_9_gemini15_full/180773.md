词源:

Regulation comes from the Late Latin word *regulationem*, a noun of action from the verb *regulare*, meaning "to make straight, to adjust, to govern."  *Regulare* itself is from the Latin *regula*, meaning "rule," "straight line," or "ruler."  The English word ultimately traces back to the Latin root meaning "to make straight," reflecting the idea of setting things in order or establishing rules.
