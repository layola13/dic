词源:

The word is formed by adding the negative prefix "less" to "lumber," which originally referred to felled trees or timber.  The sense of "lumber" evolving to mean something cumbersome or heavy is a later development.  Therefore, "lumberless" directly signifies "without the quality of lumber" – meaning without being heavy, bulky, or clumsy.
