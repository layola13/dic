The word "laas" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of another word.  Could you please double-check the spelling?
* **A proper noun:** It might be a proper noun (a name of a person, place, or thing), specific to a certain context or language.
* **A word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language. If you can provide the context or origin of the word, I might be able to help.

Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.
