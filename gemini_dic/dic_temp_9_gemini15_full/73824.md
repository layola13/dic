formicaroid: /ˌfɔːrmɪˈkærɔɪd/ | adj. | 蚁形的；似蚁的 | Resembling an ant in form or appearance.  The term often refers to insects or other organisms that exhibit ant-like characteristics, such as a narrow waist and a segmented body.  It is primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly in entomology and related fields. | Example:  The formicaroid mimicry of the spider was remarkably effective.  这只蜘蛛的蚁形拟态非常有效。  | 近义词: ant-like, myrmecoid | 反义词:  N/A (no direct antonym, but words describing opposite shapes could be considered contextual opposites) |


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The insect exhibits formicaroid characteristics. = 这昆虫展现出蚁形特征。
This species displays a formicaroid body plan. = 这个物种展现出蚁形的体型结构。


一般过去时:
Scientists observed formicaroid behavior in the specimen. = 科学家们观察到标本的蚁形行为。
The researchers documented the formicaroid morphology. = 研究人员记录了蚁形形态。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several formicaroid species. = 研究人员已经鉴别出几种蚁形物种。
Entomologists have studied formicaroid mimicry extensively. = 昆虫学家已经广泛研究了蚁形拟态。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, little was known about formicaroid insects. = 在发现之前，人们对蚁形昆虫知之甚少。
They had already classified the insect as formicaroid. = 他们已经将这种昆虫归类为蚁形昆虫。


将来时:
Scientists will continue to study formicaroid adaptations. = 科学家们将继续研究蚁形适应性。
We will likely discover more formicaroid species in the future. = 我们将来可能会发现更多蚁形物种。


虚拟语气:
If the insect were truly formicaroid, it would exhibit certain behaviors. = 如果这种昆虫真的是蚁形的，它会表现出某些行为。
I wish I had more information on formicaroid evolution. = 我希望我有更多关于蚁形进化方面的信息。


被动语态:
Formicaroid characteristics were observed in the sample. = 在样本中观察到蚁形特征。
The insect was initially misidentified as formicaroid. = 这只昆虫最初被误认为是蚁形的。


疑问句:
Is this insect truly formicaroid? = 这只昆虫真的是蚁形的吗？
Are there any other examples of formicaroid mimicry? = 还有其他蚁形拟态的例子吗？


否定句:
The insect is not strictly formicaroid. = 这只昆虫并非严格意义上的蚁形。
The specimen did not exhibit typical formicaroid features. = 这个标本没有表现出典型的蚁形特征。


PHRASE->
formicaroid morphology = 蚁形形态
formicaroid mimicry = 蚁形拟态
formicaroid behavior = 蚁形行为
formicaroid adaptation = 蚁形适应
