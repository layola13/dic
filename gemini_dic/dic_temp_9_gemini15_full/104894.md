词源:
The word "keeping" originates from the Old English word *ceping, meaning "guarding, protection, observation."  This in turn derives from the Proto-Germanic *keppan, with the same general meaning. The connection is clear to modern English verbs like "to keep," implying a continuous act of maintaining or preserving.
