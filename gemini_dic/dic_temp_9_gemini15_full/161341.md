The word "postprostate" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or corpora.  There is no established meaning, pronunciation, or usage.  It appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a complete analysis following your requested format is impossible.  To provide a meaningful response, more context is needed regarding where you encountered this word.  It's likely a combination of "post-" (after, following) and "prostate" (referring to the prostate gland), suggesting a possible meaning related to a condition or treatment *after* a prostate procedure or diagnosis.  However, without further information, any analysis would be purely speculative.
