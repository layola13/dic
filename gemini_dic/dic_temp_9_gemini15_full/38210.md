词源:
The word "compunctious" comes from the Middle English word "compunctious," which in turn originates from the Old French "componction" and ultimately from the Latin "compunctio," meaning "pricking of conscience."  The Latin word is formed from "compungere," meaning "to prick, to sting." This reflects the feeling of a sharp, painful remorse.
