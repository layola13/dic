The word "dicacious" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis according to the specified format.  It's possible this is a misspelling or a newly coined word.  If you can provide more context or clarify the intended word, I can assist further.
