词源:
The word "headshake" is a compound word formed from "head" and "shake."  "Head" refers to the head, and "shake" means to move something rapidly to and fro or up and down. The combination describes the action of moving one's head.  Its etymology traces back to the Old English words "heafod" (head) and "scacan" (to shake).
