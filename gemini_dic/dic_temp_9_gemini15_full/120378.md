词源:  Derived from "minion," meaning a servile follower or favorite. The suffix "-ly" transforms the noun into an adverb, describing the manner in which something is done.  The word's roots trace back to Old French "mignon," meaning "darling," "favorite," which ultimately derives from Latin "minimus" meaning "smallest," "least."  The semantic shift from "favorite" to "subservient favorite" occurred over time.
