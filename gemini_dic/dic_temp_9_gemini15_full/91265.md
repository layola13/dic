hydrogel:/ˈhaɪdroʊdʒɛl/| n. |水凝胶|A hydrogel is a network of polymer chains that are hydrophilic, meaning they attract and absorb water.  This results in a gel that can contain a large amount of water, often up to 99% by weight. Hydrogels are used in a wide variety of applications, from contact lenses to wound dressings. |Example:  The researchers developed a new hydrogel for drug delivery.  研究人员开发了一种用于药物递送的新型水凝胶。  The wound was treated with a hydrogel dressing to promote healing. 伤口用敷料水凝胶治疗以促进愈合。|近义词：gel, polymer |反义词：None specifically, but materials lacking water absorption capabilities could be considered opposite.
