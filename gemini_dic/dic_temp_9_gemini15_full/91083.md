huttoning:/ˈhʌtənɪŋ/| n. |休顿式耕作|Huttoning refers to a specific method of land cultivation, particularly associated with the Scottish agricultural reformer James Hutton.  It involves a system of deep plowing and soil management techniques aimed at improving soil fertility and crop yields. The exact practices varied, but generally emphasized thorough soil preparation and crop rotation. Because it is a relatively niche term, detailed information on its precise methods is scarce outside of historical agricultural texts.  |The farmer implemented huttoning techniques to revitalize his depleted fields.  | 近义词: deep plowing, improved farming practices| 反义词:  shallow plowing, unsustainable farming practices|
