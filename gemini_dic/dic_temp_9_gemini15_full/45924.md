词源:

The term "cutting edge" originates from the literal meaning of a blade's sharpest point.  The sharpest part of a knife or sword is its "cutting edge," representing the most effective or potent part.  Figuratively, this has extended to describe the forefront of any field, especially technology or innovation. The use evolved to describe the leading edge of technology and innovation.


用法说明:


cutting-edge通常用作形容词，修饰名词，表示某事物处于科技或发展的前沿。它强调的是创新性、先进性和突破性。


例如：

cutting-edge technology:  尖端技术
cutting-edge research:  前沿研究
