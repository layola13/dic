词源:
The word "pedestalled" comes from the noun "pedestal," which ultimately derives from the Italian word "piedistallo," a combination of "piede" (foot) and "stallo" (stall or stand).  Thus, the original meaning refers to a base or stand upon which something is placed.  The verb form "pedestalled" extends this meaning to the figurative sense of elevating someone or something to a position of importance or reverence.
