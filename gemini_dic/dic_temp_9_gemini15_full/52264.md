词源:
The word "dice" comes from the Old French word "des," which is the plural of "de," meaning "die."  The singular "die" is related to the Old English word "dīe," meaning a small cube.  Ultimately, the word's origins trace back to the Latin word "datum," meaning "something given" or "a thing given," referring to the chance outcome of the throw.
