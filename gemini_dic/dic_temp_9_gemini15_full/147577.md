词源:
The word "overpersuasion" is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great extent) and "persuasion" (the act of persuading someone to do something).  Both parts have Latin roots. "Persuasion" derives from the Latin "persuadere," meaning "to persuade."  "Over" has Germanic origins.
