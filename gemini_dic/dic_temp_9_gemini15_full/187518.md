词源:
The term "roly-poly" is an onomatopoeic word, imitating the sound of the creature rolling.  The first part, "roly," suggests the rolling motion, while "poly" is likely a playful alteration or shortening of words suggesting roundness or fullness.  The exact etymological origins are difficult to pinpoint precisely but reflect the creature's behavior.
