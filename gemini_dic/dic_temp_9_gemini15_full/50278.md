dephosphorization:/ˌdiːfɒsfəraɪˈzeɪʃn/| n.|脱磷作用；去磷|The removal of phosphorus from a substance, typically iron or steel, to improve its quality.  This process is crucial in steelmaking to enhance the steel's properties and reduce brittleness.|例句：The dephosphorization process in the steel mill was carefully monitored.  钢铁厂的脱磷过程受到了严格的监控。

The effective dephosphorization of molten iron is essential for high-quality steel production.  炼铁的有效脱磷对于生产高质量钢材至关重要。|近义词：phosphorus removal|反义词：phosphorization|无
