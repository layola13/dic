词源：

From Greek *meta* "after, beyond" + *meros* "part".  The term reflects the fact that the colors share the same perceived color (the "same part" visually) but have different spectral compositions (different "parts" in terms of the light spectrum).


用法说明：

Metamerism is a significant concept in color science, particularly in fields like textile manufacturing, printing, and paint production.  Accurate color matching across different light sources requires understanding and accounting for metamerism.  The study of metamers helps in developing color management systems and color-matching techniques.  It's also relevant in areas like digital imaging and photography, where the reproduction of colors on different devices can lead to metameric matches.
