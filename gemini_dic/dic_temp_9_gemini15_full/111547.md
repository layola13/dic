词源:
The word "lob" likely originated from the Middle English word "lobbe," meaning "a large lump or mass," or a "heavy blow."  This suggests a connection to the forceful, somewhat clumsy nature of a lobbed throw.  Its evolution into a verb describing a specific type of throw likely occurred over time, reflecting the action's arc and the relatively gentle impact compared to a harder throw.
