词源:
The word "macho" comes from the Spanish word "macho," meaning "male." It entered English in the mid-20th century, initially referring to a stereotypically masculine man, often associated with Latin American culture.  Over time, its usage broadened to encompass a wider range of aggressive or domineering masculine behavior, regardless of cultural origin.
