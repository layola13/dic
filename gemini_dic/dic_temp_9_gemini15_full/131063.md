词源：

The word is a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "barbarous" (meaning "uncivilized, savage").  "Barbarous" originates from the Latin word "barbarus," referring to foreign peoples whose languages sounded like "bar-bar" to the Romans.  Thus, "nonbarbarous" implies a rejection of savagery and an embrace of civilization.
