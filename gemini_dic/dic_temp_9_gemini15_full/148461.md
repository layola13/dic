overstraightnesses:/ˌoʊvərˈstreɪtnəsɪz/| n. | 过分正直；矫枉过正；过分笔直|The word "overstraightnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, likely formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning excessive) to "straightnesses," which itself is an uncommon word referring to instances or states of being straight.  The meaning is derived from the combination of these elements, suggesting an excessive or unnatural degree of straightness or rectitude.  Therefore, it implies an exaggerated emphasis on honesty, correctness, or literalness, possibly to a fault. It can also describe excessive straightness in a physical sense, like overly straight lines or overly rigid posture. |There are no standard examples as it's not a dictionary word.  One could construct a sentence such as: "His overstraightnesses in his moral pronouncements made him unpopular." or "The overstraightnesses of the newly built fence were quite jarring."|近义词:excessiveness, rigidity, inflexibility, overzealousness|反义词:flexibility, laxity, crookedness, indirectness|n.
