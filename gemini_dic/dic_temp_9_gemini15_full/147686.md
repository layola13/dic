USAGE->
This word is extremely rare and doesn't have standard grammatical usage examples in the way common words do.  Its usage is limited to expressing the intensity of overwhelming forces or feelings.  Therefore, providing examples for tenses, etc., would be artificial and misleading.  The word itself is a somewhat awkward and unusual formation.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "overpoweringnesses".  The word is too unwieldy for common phrasal usage.
