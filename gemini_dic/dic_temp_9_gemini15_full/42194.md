词源:
The word "coumaric" is derived from "coumarin," a naturally occurring fragrant compound found in many plants.  "Coumarin" itself originates from the French word "coumarine," which is in turn derived from the  "coumarou," a South American tree from which coumarin was first isolated.  The suffix "-ic" is used to form adjectives, indicating a relationship to or characteristic of coumarin.
