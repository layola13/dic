词源:
The word "kaleidoscope" is derived from Greek roots:

* **καλός (kalos):** beautiful
* **εἶδος (eidos):** form, shape
* **σκοπέω (skopeō):** to view, to see


Therefore, kaleidoscope literally means "beautiful form viewer" or "beautiful shape viewer," reflecting its function of displaying beautiful and constantly changing patterns.
