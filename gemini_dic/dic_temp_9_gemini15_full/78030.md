词源:
The word "gentry" ultimately derives from the Old French word "gent," meaning "people" or "folk."  Over time, it acquired the connotation of "noble birth" or "high social standing," ultimately leading to its current meaning referring to a class of people ranking below nobility but above commoners.  The suffix "-ry" indicates a collective or class of people.
