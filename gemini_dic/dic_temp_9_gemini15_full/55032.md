词源:

The word "disquietedly" is derived from the adjective "disquieted," which itself comes from the verb "disquiet."  Let's break it down:

* **quiet:**  This root word means peaceful, calm, or tranquil.  Its origins trace back to Old French "quiet" and ultimately to Latin "quietus" (restful).

* **dis-:** This is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of."

* **-ed:** This is a past participle suffix, indicating a completed action or a state resulting from an action.

* **-ly:** This is an adverbial suffix, transforming the adjective into an adverb, modifying verbs and describing how an action is performed.


Therefore, "disquietedly" means "in a manner that is not quiet," or "in an uneasy or restless manner."
