/ˈpɛkɪŋzɪz/| n. |啄食；争斗；争夺|The word "peckingses" is not a standard English word.  It seems to be a non-standard pluralization of "pecking," which itself is a noun or verb referring to the act of pecking (as a bird pecks at food) or a metaphorical extension of this to describe competitive or aggressive behavior.  Therefore, any analysis would be based on the root word "pecking."|例句：The chickens engaged in constant peckingses over the grain. (This sentence uses the non-standard plural, illustrating its potential meaning)|近义词：bickering, squabbling, fighting, struggles, contests|反义词：harmony, cooperation, peace
