refeels:/riːˈfiːlz/|  n.|再感觉，重新感受|The word "refeels" is not a standard English word. It's likely a neologism or a misspelling. It seems to combine "re-" (again) and "feels" (sensations, emotions).  Therefore, a potential meaning could be experiencing feelings again, or having a renewed sense of something. However, without a standard dictionary definition, its usage is unclear and should be avoided in formal writing.| Example: (Hypothetical)  He refeels the joy of his childhood summer vacations. 他再次感受到童年暑假时的快乐。 |近义词:|re-experiences, revisits, re-encounters|反义词:|no direct antonym, but possibly words suggesting forgetting or suppression of feelings|词性|n.
