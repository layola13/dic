Word Origin:  The word is derived from "overhasty" (excessively hasty), which itself combines "over-" (too much) and "hasty" (done or acting too quickly). The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "overhasty" into the noun "overhastiness," and the further suffix "-es" creates the plural form "overhastinesses."  The root can be traced to Old English "hāst" (quick, swift).
