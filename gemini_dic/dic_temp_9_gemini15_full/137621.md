nontubular: /ˌnɑːnˈtjubjələr/ | adj. | 非管状的；非管形的 | Not having the shape or form of a tube.  This term is used to describe structures or objects that lack the cylindrical, hollow form characteristic of a tube.  It often appears in scientific or technical contexts when describing the morphology of biological structures or manufactured components. | Example:  The nontubular glands secreted a viscous fluid.  非管状腺体分泌粘稠液体。 The nontubular bone structure was unusual.  非管状骨骼结构不同寻常。 | 近义词: noncylindrical,  tubeless | 反义词: tubular


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The structure is nontubular. = 这个结构是非管状的。
These glands are nontubular. = 这些腺体是非管状的。


一般过去时:
The scientists observed a nontubular formation. = 科学家们观察到一个非管状结构。
The analysis revealed a nontubular arrangement of cells. = 分析显示细胞排列是非管状的。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several nontubular species. = 研究人员已经确定了几种非管状物种。
We have confirmed the nontubular nature of the sample. = 我们已经证实了样品的非管状性质。


过去完成时:
They had already examined the nontubular components. = 他们之前已经检查过非管状组件。
Scientists had hypothesized a nontubular origin for the structure. = 科学家们曾假设该结构起源于非管状结构。


将来时:
We will investigate the nontubular structures further. = 我们将进一步研究非管状结构。
They will analyze the nontubular material tomorrow. = 他们明天将分析非管状材料。


虚拟语气:
If the structure were nontubular, the results would differ. = 如果结构是非管状的，结果将会不同。
I wish the specimen were nontubular for easier analysis. = 我希望标本是非管状的，以便更容易分析。


被动语态:
The nontubular components were carefully examined. = 非管状组件经过仔细检查。
The sample was determined to be nontubular. = 样本被确定为非管状的。


疑问句:
Is the organ nontubular? = 这个器官是非管状的吗？
Are these cells arranged in a nontubular fashion? = 这些细胞是非管状排列的吗？


否定句:
The bone is not nontubular; it's tubular. = 这块骨头不是非管状的；它是管状的。
The system is not composed of nontubular elements. = 该系统并非由非管状元素组成。
