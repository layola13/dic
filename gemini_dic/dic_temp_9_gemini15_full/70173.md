词源:
The word "fibreboard" is a compound word.  "Fibre" comes from the Old French "fibre," ultimately from the Latin "fibra," meaning "fiber" or "thread." "Board" comes from the Old English "bord," meaning a flat piece of wood.  Therefore, fibreboard literally means a board made of compressed fibers.
