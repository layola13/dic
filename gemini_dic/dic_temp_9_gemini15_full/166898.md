词源:
The word "prestant" comes from the Middle French word "prestant," meaning "ready, prompt, excellent."  It ultimately derives from the Latin "praestans," the present participle of "praestare," meaning "to stand before, excel, surpass."  In music, it specifically refers to a type of organ stop, highlighting its power and prominence.
