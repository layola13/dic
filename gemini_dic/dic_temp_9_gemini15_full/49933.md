dendrite:/ˈdɛndraɪt/ | n. |树突；树枝状突起 | A short, branched extension of a nerve cell that receives impulses from other nerve cells and conducts them toward the cell body.  Dendrites are crucial for receiving signals from other neurons and transmitting them to the neuron's cell body. They increase the surface area of the neuron, allowing it to receive signals from many other neurons simultaneously. | Example:  The dendrites of a neuron receive signals from other neurons.  树突接收来自其他神经元的信号。


The intricate branching pattern of dendrites resembles a tree, hence the name derived from the Greek word "dendron," meaning "tree."  The study of dendrites is a major focus in neuroscience, as their structure and function are essential to understanding how the brain processes information.  Damage or dysfunction of dendrites can contribute to various neurological disorders. |近义词：neuronal process, arborization | 反义词：axon
