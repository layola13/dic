词源:
The word "cannot" is a contraction of "can not."  "Can" itself has complex origins, ultimately deriving from the Old English "cunnan," meaning "to know," which reflects its original usage as an auxiliary verb expressing ability or possibility. The negative "not" is a straightforward addition to the verb.  The contraction "cannot" is a natural development in English, reflecting a preference for shorter, more efficient forms of speech and writing.
