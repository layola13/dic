词源:
The word "gastight" is a compound word formed from "gas" and "tight."  "Gas" originates from the early 17th century, from Dutch *gas, from Old Dutch *gast, from Proto-Germanic *gastuz, of unknown ultimate origin. "Tight" is from Old English *tīht, from Proto-Germanic *teikjaz, meaning "firm, compact, close."  The combination creates the adjective describing something that prevents the passage of gas.
