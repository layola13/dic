metalammonium: /ˌmɛtəlˈæmoʊniəm/ | n. | 金属铵盐 |  A metal ammonium salt is a compound containing a metal cation and an ammonium cation (NH₄⁺)  anion. These salts are often formed by the reaction of a metal hydroxide with ammonium salts. They exhibit a range of properties depending on the specific metal involved.  Many are used in various applications in chemistry and industry. |  例句：The synthesis involved the formation of a novel metal ammonium phosphate.  金属铵磷酸盐的新合成方法。


近义词：metal ammine (sometimes used interchangeably, but ammine refers specifically to ammonia complexes) | 反义词：无直接反义词

词源:  The word "metalammonium" is a combination of "metal" and "ammonium."  "Metal" derives from the Old French *metal, ultimately from the Latin metallum ("mine," "metal"). "Ammonium" comes from the Latin word *ammoniacus, referring to a salt obtained near the temple of Jupiter Ammon in ancient Egypt, where it was originally found.
