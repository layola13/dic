fluorescence:/flʊəˈrɛs(ə)ns/| n. |荧光；荧光现象 |The emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation.  It is a form of luminescence.  Fluorescence differs from phosphorescence in that it only occurs when the substance is being excited. |例句：The mineral displayed a bright fluorescence under ultraviolet light.  这种矿物在紫外线下发出明亮的荧光。

The fluorescence of the dye made the fabric glow.  这种染料的荧光使织物发光。


近义词：luminescence, phosphorescence (but with important distinctions) |反义词：无直接反义词，可考虑用absence of fluorescence. |词性:名词


USAGE->

疑问句:
What causes this material to exhibit such strong fluorescence? = 什么原因导致这种材料表现出如此强的荧光？
Does the fluorescence intensity change with temperature? = 荧光强度随温度变化吗？


否定句:
The sample did not show any detectable fluorescence. = 样品没有显示任何可检测到的荧光。
This material does not exhibit fluorescence under visible light. = 这种材料在可见光下不显示荧光。


PHRASE->
fluorescence microscopy:荧光显微镜
fluorescence spectroscopy:荧光光谱学
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH):荧光原位杂交
fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET):荧光共振能量转移
fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM):荧光寿命成像显微镜


词源:
The word "fluorescence" comes from the mineral fluorite (萤石), which exhibits the phenomenon.  The suffix "-escence" indicates a process or state of becoming.  Therefore, fluorescence literally means "the process of becoming like fluorite" in terms of its light emission properties.
