The word "interresisted" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need to consider potential intended words and their analyses.  If you can provide the intended word or context, I can give a detailed analysis.
