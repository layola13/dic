词源:

The word "imaginableness" is derived from the word "imagine," which comes from the Latin word "imaginari," meaning "to form a mental image, to conceive, to invent." The suffix "-able" signifies "capable of being" or "worthy of being," and the further suffix "-ness" indicates a state or quality.  Therefore, "imaginableness" literally means "the state or quality of being capable of being imagined."
