half-normal:/ˈhæfˈnɔːrməl/| adj. | 半正态的，半正常的 |  Relating to or characteristic of a half-normal distribution;  partially normal or typical.  It often refers to a probability distribution where the random variable is the absolute value of a normally distributed variable. | Example: The data showed a half-normal distribution after transformation. 数据转换后呈现半正态分布。| 近义词: semi-normal (less common) | 反义词:  fully normal, abnormal |  adj.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The data follows a half-normal distribution. = 数据遵循半正态分布。
This process is half-normal. = 这个过程是半正常的。


一般过去时:
The results were approximated by a half-normal distribution. = 结果由半正态分布近似表示。
The system behaved half-normally under those conditions. = 在那种情况下，系统表现为半正常状态。


现在完成时:
Researchers have used half-normal plots to analyze the data. = 研究人员已经使用半正态图来分析数据。
We have observed half-normal behavior in many experiments. = 我们在许多实验中观察到半正常的行为。


过去完成时:
They had already assumed a half-normal distribution before the analysis. = 他们在分析之前就已经假设了半正态分布。
The engineers had found the system to be half-normally functioning. = 工程师们发现系统处于半正常运行状态。


将来时:
We will use a half-normal model for this simulation. = 我们将使用半正态模型进行此模拟。
The software will generate half-normally distributed random numbers. = 该软件将生成半正态分布的随机数。


虚拟语气:
If the data were half-normally distributed, the analysis would be simpler. = 如果数据服从半正态分布，分析将更简单。
It would be beneficial if we could assume a half-normal distribution. = 如果我们可以假设半正态分布，那将是有益的。


被动语态:
The data were analyzed using a half-normal distribution assumption. = 数据是在假设半正态分布的基础上进行分析的。
A half-normal distribution model was applied to fit the data. = 应用半正态分布模型来拟合数据。


疑问句:
Is the data half-normally distributed? = 数据是否服从半正态分布？
Does this model assume a half-normal distribution? = 此模型是否假设半正态分布？


否定句:
The data are not half-normally distributed. = 数据不服从半正态分布。
The system did not behave half-normally during the test. = 系统在测试期间并未表现出半正常状态。


PHRASE->
half-normal distribution = 半正态分布
half-normal plot = 半正态图
half-normal probability plot = 半正态概率图
half-normal likelihood = 半正态似然函数
half-normal assumption = 半正态假设


词源:
The term "half-normal" is a compound word combining "half" (meaning one of two equal parts) and "normal" (referring to the normal distribution in statistics).  It describes a distribution derived from a normal distribution by taking the absolute value of the random variable.  Therefore, only the positive half of the normal distribution is considered.
