词源:
moralising comes from the word "moral," meaning relating to principles of right and wrong behaviour, combined with the suffix "-ising" (or "-izing" in American English), indicating the act of doing something.  The root of "moral" traces back to Latin "moralis," meaning "of or relating to character or manners."
