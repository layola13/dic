prethrusts:/ˈpriːθrʌsts/| n.|前冲，预先推动|  The term "prethrusts" refers to movements or actions that occur *before* a main thrust or a significant event. It often implies preparatory actions or movements that set the stage for a larger event.  It's not a commonly used word and its usage is highly context-dependent.  It's primarily used in specialized fields like geology or engineering.|例句：The geological survey revealed several prethrusts indicating a significant tectonic shift was imminent. 地质勘测显示出几次前冲，表明即将发生重大的构造变化。  The team performed several prethrusts before attempting the main lift of the heavy machinery.  在尝试提升重型机械之前，团队进行了多次预先推动。|近义词：precursors, preliminary movements, anticipatory actions|反义词：aftershocks, aftermath, consequences


USAGE->
This word is so specialized it's difficult to provide example sentences across standard grammatical tenses.  The usage heavily depends on the context (geology, engineering, etc.).  The following examples illustrate potential scenarios:

一般现在时:
The engineer explains that the prethrusts stabilize the structure. 工程师解释说，前冲使结构稳定。
These prethrusts are crucial for successful bridge construction. 这些前冲对于成功的桥梁建设至关重要。


一般过去时:
The geologist noted the prethrusts in the rock strata. 地质学家注意到岩石地层中的前冲。
The team documented all prethrusts before the main excavation. 团队在主要挖掘之前记录了所有前冲。


现在完成时:
The team has completed all the necessary prethrusts.  团队已经完成了所有必要的预先推动。
Scientists have observed several prethrusts leading up to the volcanic eruption. 科学家们已经观察到几次火山爆发前的预先推动。


过去完成时:
They had completed the prethrusts before the main demolition began.  在主要拆除工作开始之前，他们已经完成了预先推动。
Geologists realized that significant prethrusts had occurred before the earthquake. 地质学家意识到地震前发生了重大的前冲。


将来时:
The construction crew will perform several prethrusts tomorrow. 建设人员明天将进行几次预先推动。
We predict that several prethrusts will occur before the landslide. 我们预测在滑坡发生前会发生几次前冲。


虚拟语气:
If we had recognized the prethrusts earlier, we could have prevented the collapse. 如果我们早些发现前冲，我们就能防止坍塌。
If the prethrusts were more significant, the main event would have been more intense. 如果前冲更显著，主要事件的强度就会更大。


被动语态:
The prethrusts were carefully documented by the researchers.  前冲被研究人员仔细记录。
Several prethrusts were detected before the fault line ruptured. 在断层线破裂之前检测到几次前冲。


疑问句:
Were there any prethrusts observed before the eruption? 在喷发前观察到任何前冲了吗？
What kind of prethrusts are expected before the main construction phase? 在主要建设阶段之前预计会发生什么样的前冲？


否定句:
There were no noticeable prethrusts before the sudden collapse. 在突然坍塌之前没有明显的预先推动。
The analysis showed that no significant prethrusts preceded the event. 分析表明，该事件之前没有发生重大的前冲。


PHRASE->
This word doesn't readily form common phrases. The usage is highly contextual.  Instead of phrases, we can show examples of how it might be used within a larger phrase:

"series of prethrusts," "evidence of prethrusts," "analyzing prethrusts," "magnitude of prethrusts," "prediction of prethrusts"
