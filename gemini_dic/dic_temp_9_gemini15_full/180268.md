refrangible:/rɪˈfrændʒəbəl/| adj.| 可折射的，易于折射的 | Capable of being refracted; easily bent or deflected.  The term refers to the ability of a wave, typically light, to change direction when passing from one medium to another.  This bending is due to a change in the wave's speed. | Example:  Light is refrangible, meaning it bends when passing from air to water.  光线是可折射的，这意味着它在从空气进入水中时会弯曲。 |近义词：refractible |反义词：non-refractible
