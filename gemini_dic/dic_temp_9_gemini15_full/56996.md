词源:

The word "double-edgedness" is a modern English word formed by combining "double-edged" (itself a compound adjective meaning having two edges or sides, often implying a double effect) and the suffix "-ness," which creates a noun signifying the state or quality of being something.  The "double-edged" part has roots in the physical description of a double-edged sword or knife, which can cut in both directions.  The concept has then been extended metaphorically to describe situations with both positive and negative aspects.
