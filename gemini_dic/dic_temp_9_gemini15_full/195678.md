semisextile:/ˈsemiˈsɛkstaɪl/| n.| 半六分相 (占星术)| In astrology, a semisextile is an aspect between two planets that are 30 degrees apart.  This aspect is considered to be minor and often represents a subtle influence or connection between the planets involved.  It can suggest a potential for growth or collaboration, but it doesn't carry the same weight as major aspects like conjunctions or oppositions. | Example: The semisextile between Mars and Venus in her chart suggests a potential for creative energy and romantic passion, but this influence is subtle and requires conscious effort to manifest. | 近义词: minor aspect (in astrology) | 反义词:  major aspect (in astrology), conjunction, opposition | 名词
