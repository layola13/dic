constructibilities:/kənˌstrʌktəˈbɪlətiz/| n. |可构造性；可构建性|The study of constructibilities focuses on the possibility and methods of constructing certain mathematical objects or systems.  It explores the limitations and possibilities within a given framework or axiomatic system.  For example, in geometry, constructibilities might examine what shapes or figures can be constructed using only a compass and straightedge.  In computer science, it might relate to the feasibility of building specific data structures or algorithms.|例句：The constructibilities of various geometric figures were a key focus of ancient Greek mathematicians.  = 古希腊数学家非常关注各种几何图形的可构造性。


The research paper investigates the constructibilities of complex networks in distributed systems. = 这篇研究论文调查了分布式系统中复杂网络的可构造性。|近义词：constructability, feasibility, buildability |反义词：impossibility, unfeasibility, unbuildability


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in academic settings, particularly in mathematics and computer science.  Therefore, illustrating its usage across various grammatical tenses is less relevant than showing its application in different contexts within those fields.

Example 1 (Mathematics):

The limitations on constructibilities within Euclidean geometry are well-established. = 欧几里得几何学中可构造性的局限性已得到充分证明。


Example 2 (Computer Science):

The paper explores the constructibilities of efficient algorithms for large datasets. = 这篇论文探讨了针对大型数据集的高效算法的可构造性。


Example 3 (Philosophy of Mathematics):

Debates surrounding constructibilities often touch upon foundational questions about the nature of mathematical objects. = 关于可构造性的争论常常涉及到关于数学对象本质的基础性问题。


Example 4 (Theoretical Physics):

Certain models in theoretical physics rely on specific constructibilities to represent physical phenomena. = 理论物理学中某些模型依赖于特定的可构造性来表示物理现象。


PHRASE->

Common phrases using or related to "constructibility" are less about fixed collocations and more about broader conceptual contexts.  Therefore, a list of common phrases in the traditional sense is not applicable.  Instead, here are examples demonstrating the word's use in common theoretical discussions:

"Limits of constructibility" = 可构造性的局限性
"Practical constructibility" = 实用可构造性
"Theoretical constructibility" = 理论可构造性
"Constructibility proof" = 可构造性证明
"Issues of constructibility" = 可构造性问题
