词源:  Derived from the adjective "capable," meaning having the ability to do something.  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner in which something is done.  The root of "capable" can be traced back to the Old French "capable," ultimately deriving from the Latin "capax," meaning "roomy," "spacious," or "able to hold."  The sense of ability developed from the idea of something having the capacity or space to contain or accomplish something.
