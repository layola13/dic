ontogenesis:/ˌɒn.təʊˈdʒɛnɪsɪs/| n. |个体发育，个体发生|The process by which an individual organism grows and develops from a simple to a more complex form.  It encompasses all the changes that occur during the life cycle of an organism, from fertilization to death. |Example: The ontogenesis of a butterfly involves a dramatic metamorphosis from a larva to a winged adult.  蝴蝶的个体发育包括从幼虫到带翅膀的成虫的巨大变态。|近义词：development, maturation, growth|反义词：phylogenesis
