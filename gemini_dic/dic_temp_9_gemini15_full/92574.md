The word "hyuri" is not found in standard English dictionaries or common usage.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a proper noun, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific dialect or language, or a misspelling.  To provide the requested analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (e.g., a book, website, conversation)
* **What is the context of its use?**  This will help determine its meaning and potential grammatical function.

Without this information, I cannot provide the phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical explanations.
