词源:
The word "machinate" comes from the Late Latin word "machinari," meaning "to build a machine," or "to contrive," via the Medieval Latin "machinatio," meaning "contrivance, plot".  The original sense related to the construction of complex devices or plans, later evolving to its current association with secret and often malicious plotting.
