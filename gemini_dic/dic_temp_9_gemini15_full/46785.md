dangler:/ˈdæŋɡlər/| n. |悬空物，悬垂物，游离成分|A dangler refers to a word, phrase, or clause that is grammatically unconnected to the rest of the sentence.  It typically modifies a word that isn't present in the sentence, creating a dangling modifier. This often leads to ambiguity or a nonsensical sentence.|Example:  Walking down the street, a car almost hit me. (Incorrect -  "Walking down the street" doesn't modify "car".)  Corrected: While walking down the street, I was almost hit by a car. |近义词：unattached element, misplaced modifier|反义词：None specifically, but a correctly placed modifier is the opposite.
