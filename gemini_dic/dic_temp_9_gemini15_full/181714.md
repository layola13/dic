词源:

The word "reliability" is derived from the adjective "reliable," which in turn comes from the verb "rely."  "Rely" ultimately traces back to the Old French word "relier," meaning "to bind again, to connect."  The prefix "re-" indicates repetition or intensification, while "-able" signifies capability or suitability.  Therefore, "reliable" means capable of being depended upon, and "reliability" signifies the quality or state of being reliable.
