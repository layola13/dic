词源:
The word "impoliteness" is derived from the prefix "im-" (meaning "not") and the noun "politeness."  "Politeness" ultimately comes from the Old French word "polices," meaning "polished," referring to refined manners and behavior.  The evolution reflects a shift from a physical description of smoothness to a social one of refined manners.
