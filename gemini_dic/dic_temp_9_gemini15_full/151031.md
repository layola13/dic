parapatrically:/ˌpærəˈpætɹɪkli/| adv.| 副词 | 邻域种群分化地；在邻域物种形成中 |  Describes a mode of speciation where populations diverge and become reproductively isolated while maintaining contact along a common border. This differs from allopatric speciation (geographic isolation) and sympatric speciation (overlap without geographic separation).  | Example:  The two species of frogs evolved parapatrically, maintaining a narrow zone of contact along a river. 这两种蛙类通过邻域物种形成进化而来，沿着一条河流维持着狭窄的接触带。 | 近义词: peripherally (in the context of geographic proximity during speciation) | 反义词: allopatrically, sympatrically
