propellers:/prəˈpɛlərz/ | n. |螺旋桨 |Rotating blades that push a vessel or aircraft through a fluid (air or water).  Propellers convert rotational motion into thrust.  They are commonly used in airplanes, ships, and submarines. |例句：The airplane's propellers whirred as it took off.  飞机的螺旋桨在起飞时嗡嗡作响。

The ship's propellers churned the water.  船的螺旋桨搅动着水。|近义词：screws, fans (in some contexts) |反义词：None directly applicable.  The opposite concept would be jet propulsion or rowing.

词源:
From "propel" (to drive or push forward) + "-er" (agent suffix).  The word "propel" itself comes from the Latin "propellere," meaning "to drive forward,"  from "pro-" (forward) + "pellere" (to drive, push).
