词源:  The word "sizar" comes from the Middle English word "sizer," which in turn derives from the Old French "assizer" meaning "to assess" or "to fix the size or amount of."  This refers to the original practice of assessing a student's financial need to determine the amount of financial aid they would receive.  The word evolved to describe the student themselves who benefited from this assessment.
