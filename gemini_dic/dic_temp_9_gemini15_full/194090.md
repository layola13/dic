WORD ORIGIN->

The word "self-illumined" is a compound word formed from:

* **self-**:  A prefix meaning "of, by, or for oneself".  It indicates that the action or quality is inherent to the subject.

* **illumine**:  A verb meaning "to light up; to brighten; to illuminate."  It derives from the Latin word "illuminare," which combines "in-" (into) and "lumen" (light).

Therefore, "self-illumined" literally means "lit up by itself" or "shining from within."
