词源:  The word is a combination of "cheap" and "skating,"  "skating" here acts as a verb suffix, implying a continuous or habitual action.  The overall effect is to create a vivid and somewhat informal term for extreme frugality.  It suggests someone who is not just frugal but who takes their frugality to an almost excessive, even unpleasant degree.
