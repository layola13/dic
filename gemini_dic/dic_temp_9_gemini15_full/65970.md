词源:
The word "exaggeration" comes from the Late Latin word *exaggeratio*, which is derived from the Latin verb *exaggerare*.  *Exaggerare* itself is a combination of the prefix *ex-* (meaning "out" or "beyond") and *aggerare* (meaning "to heap up"). Thus, the original meaning suggests "heaping up beyond measure," which perfectly captures the essence of exaggeration.
