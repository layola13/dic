词源:

The word "incommunicable" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "communicable," which derives from the Latin word "communicare" meaning "to share," "to impart," or "to make common."  Therefore, "incommunicable" literally means "not able to be shared or imparted."

It often applies to emotions, experiences, or ideas that are too complex, subtle, or personal to be adequately articulated.
