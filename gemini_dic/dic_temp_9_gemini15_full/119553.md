microstate:/ˈmaɪkroʊsteɪt/| n. |微观态；微观状态 |A microstate, in statistical mechanics, is a specific configuration of a system's microscopic constituents (e.g., the positions and momenta of atoms in a gas).  Each microstate corresponds to a particular arrangement of these constituents and contributes to the overall macroscopic properties of the system.  The number of microstates consistent with a given macroscopic state is related to the entropy of that state.  |Example: In a system of N particles, the number of microstates is enormously large, making a complete enumeration practically impossible.|近义词：microscopic state, configuration |反义词：macrostate

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The system is in a particular microstate. = 系统处于特定的微观状态。
Each microstate contributes to the overall entropy. = 每个微观状态都对总熵有贡献。

一般过去时:
The system was in a high-energy microstate. = 系统处于高能微观状态。
Scientists studied the microstates of the gas. = 科学家研究了气体的微观状态。

现在完成时:
Researchers have identified many microstates of this molecule. = 研究人员已经确定了该分子的许多微观状态。
We have calculated the total number of microstates. = 我们已经计算了微观状态的总数。

过去完成时:
The system had already transitioned to a lower-energy microstate. = 系统已经过渡到一个较低能量的微观状态。
Before the measurement, the system was in an unknown microstate. = 在测量之前，系统处于未知的微观状态。

将来时:
The simulation will predict the evolution of the microstates. = 模拟将预测微观状态的演变。
We will analyze the microstates to understand the system's behavior. = 我们将分析微观状态以了解系统的行为。

虚拟语气:
If the system were in a different microstate, the results would be different. = 如果系统处于不同的微观状态，结果将不同。
It is unlikely that the system would spontaneously transition to a higher-energy microstate. = 系统自发跃迁到更高能量的微观状态的可能性很小。

被动语态:
The microstates of the system are determined by its Hamiltonian. = 系统的微观状态由其哈密顿量决定。
The number of accessible microstates is calculated using statistical mechanics. = 可达微观状态的数量是使用统计力学计算的。

疑问句:
What are the possible microstates of this system? = 这个系统的可能微观状态是什么？
How many microstates correspond to this macroscopic state? =有多少微观状态对应于这种宏观状态？


否定句:
The system is not in its ground microstate. = 系统没有处于其基态微观状态。
Not all microstates are equally probable. = 并非所有微观状态的概率都相同。


PHRASE->
number of microstates = 微观状态数
accessible microstates = 可达微观状态
energy of microstates = 微观状态能量
distribution of microstates = 微观状态分布
