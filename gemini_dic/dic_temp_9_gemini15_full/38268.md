词源:
The word "configuring" comes from the verb "configure," which itself is derived from the Latin prefix "con-" (together, with) and the verb "figere" (to fix, to fasten).  Therefore, the original meaning hinted at "fixing together" or "arranging." The modern usage evolved through the French "configurer" before entering English.
