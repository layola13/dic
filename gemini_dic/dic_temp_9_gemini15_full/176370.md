词源:
The word "re-formations" is formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") to the noun "formations". "Formation" comes from the Old French "formacion" and ultimately from the Latin "formatio," meaning "a shaping, forming."  Therefore, "re-formations" literally means "shaping or forming again."
