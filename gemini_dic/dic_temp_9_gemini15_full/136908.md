The word "nonsolider" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a particular field or jargon.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage examples are not possible.  To provide helpful information, we would need clarification on its intended meaning or context.
