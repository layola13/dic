WORD ORIGIN->
The word "dispersability" is derived from the verb "disperse," which comes from the Latin word "dispersus," the past participle of "dispergere," meaning "to scatter," "to spread," or "to distribute."  The suffix "-ability" is added to create a noun indicating the capacity or potential for something to be dispersed.
