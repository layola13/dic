词源:

The word "semihumanitarians" is a compound word formed by combining "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partly") with "humanitarians."  "Humanitarians" derives from "humanitarian," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "humanus" (human).  The "-arian" suffix indicates a person associated with or belonging to a particular group or cause. Therefore, "semihumanitarians" describes those who only partially embody the qualities of a humanitarian.
