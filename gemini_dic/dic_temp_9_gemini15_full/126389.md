myrosin:/ˈmaɪrəsɪn/| n. |黑芥子酶，硫苷酶|Myrosin is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucosinolates, a group of sulfur-containing compounds found in plants of the Brassicaceae family (mustard, cabbage, etc.).  This hydrolysis produces isothiocyanates, which are responsible for the pungent flavor of these plants.  Myrosinase activity is often suppressed until the plant tissue is damaged, such as when it is chewed or crushed.|The hydrolysis of glucosinolates by myrosinase produces isothiocyanates, which give mustard its characteristic pungent taste. = 黑芥子酶水解硫代葡萄糖苷产生异硫氰酸酯，赋予芥末其特有的辛辣味道。

The myrosinase in mustard seeds is activated when the seeds are crushed, releasing pungent compounds. = 当芥菜籽被压碎时，其中的黑芥子酶被激活，释放出辛辣的化合物。|glucosinolate hydrolase, thioglucoside glucohydrolase|  (No clear antonym exists;  the concept of an "anti-myrosinase" is not established.)
