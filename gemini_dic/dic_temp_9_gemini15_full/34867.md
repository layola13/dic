Etymology:

The word "clinquant" comes from the Old French word "clinquant," meaning "glittering," "shining," or "tinsel."  This, in turn, is believed to derive from the Old French verb "clinquer," meaning "to clink" or "to jingle," referencing the sound of metal objects striking together. The association with glittering likely stems from the use of tinsel, often made of thin metal, in decorative applications.
