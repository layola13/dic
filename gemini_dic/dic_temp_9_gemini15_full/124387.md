词源:  The word "motley" originates from the Middle English word "motteley," which itself derives from the Old French "mottelé," meaning "speckled" or "variegated."  This in turn relates to the Old French "motte," meaning "spot" or "speck."  The original sense thus referred to a pattern of varied colors, and this evolved into the broader meaning of a diverse and heterogeneous collection.
