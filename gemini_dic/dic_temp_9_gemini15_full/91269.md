hydrogenated:/ˈhaɪdrədʒəneɪtɪd/ | adj. | 氢化的；经氢化的 |  Describes a substance that has undergone hydrogenation, a chemical process where hydrogen is added to a substance, typically an unsaturated fat, to saturate double bonds and make it more solid or stable.  This is commonly used in food processing to make margarine and other products. | Example:  Hydrogenated vegetable oil is often used in processed foods. 氢化植物油常用于加工食品中。  The hydrogenated fat is more stable at room temperature.  这种氢化脂肪在室温下更稳定。| 近义词：saturated (in the context of fats) | 反义词：unsaturated (in the context of fats)
