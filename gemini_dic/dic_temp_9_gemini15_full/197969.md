词源:

Shiversome is a combination of "shiver" (to tremble with cold or fear) and the suffix "-some," which indicates a tendency or quality.  Therefore, it literally means "causing shivers."  The word's origins trace back to the Old English word "scīfer," meaning "shavings" or "fragments", which evolved to describe the trembling associated with cold or fear. The "-some" suffix is of Old Norse origin.
