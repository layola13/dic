词源:

The word "inexpedient" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "expedient."  "Expedient" comes from the Old French "expedient," ultimately from the Latin "expedire," meaning "to extricate, disentangle, expedite."  Therefore, "inexpedient" literally means "not disentangling" or "not facilitating."  The sense of "suitable" or "advisable" developed later, reflecting the idea that something that doesn't facilitate or make things easier is often not advisable.
