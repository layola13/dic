merchet: /ˈmɜːrtʃɪt/ | n. |结婚税，入赘费| A payment made by a newly married couple to their lord or community upon marriage.  Historically, it was a common practice in various parts of Europe, particularly in the medieval period.  The amount varied depending on local customs and the wealth of the couple.  In some instances, it might be a fixed sum, while in others it could be negotiated or based on a percentage of the couple's assets.  The merchet was often seen as a way for the lord to assert his authority over the community and to generate revenue.
