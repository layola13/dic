siphoniferous: /ˌsaɪfəˈnɪfərəs/ | adj. | 能虹吸的；具有虹吸作用的 |  Able to siphon; possessing a siphon or siphons.  The term refers to structures or organisms capable of drawing fluids upwards through a tube, typically against gravity. | Example: The siphoniferous structure of the plant allowed it to draw water from the deep soil.  这植物的虹吸结构使它能够从深层土壤中吸水。| 近义词:sucking, aspirating | 反义词: non-siphoniferous


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The siphoniferous plant draws water efficiently. = 这虹吸植物高效地吸水。
This siphoniferous system transports the liquid effectively. = 这个虹吸系统有效地输送液体。


一般过去时:
The siphoniferous mechanism transported the liquid successfully. =  虹吸机制成功地输送了液体。
The plant's siphoniferous structures drew water from the ground. =  植物的虹吸结构从地下吸水。


现在完成时:
The siphoniferous system has consistently moved the liquid. =  虹吸系统一直都在输送液体。
This plant has successfully used its siphoniferous properties to survive droughts. = 这植物已成功利用其虹吸特性以度过干旱。


过去完成时:
The liquid had already been drawn up by the siphoniferous structure. = 液体已经被虹吸结构吸上来了。
The siphoniferous mechanism had failed before the experiment concluded. =  虹吸机制在实验结束前就失效了。


将来时:
The siphoniferous system will transport the liquid to the desired location. = 虹吸系统将会把液体输送到指定位置。
This siphoniferous plant will likely survive the dry season. =  这种虹吸植物很可能会在旱季生存下来。


虚拟语气:
If the structure were siphoniferous, it would work better. = 如果该结构是虹吸式的，它会运作得更好。
I wish the system were more siphoniferous for better efficiency. =  我希望该系统更具有虹吸性以提高效率。


被动语态:
The liquid is drawn up by the siphoniferous mechanism. = 液体是由虹吸机制吸上来的。
The water was effectively transported by the siphoniferous system. = 水被虹吸系统有效地输送了。


疑问句:
Is the structure siphoniferous? =  这个结构是虹吸式的吗？
Are these plants siphoniferous? =  这些植物是虹吸式的吗？


否定句:
The device is not siphoniferous. =  该装置不是虹吸式的。
The system is not designed to be siphoniferous. = 该系统并非设计成虹吸式的。


PHRASE->
siphoniferous action =虹吸作用
siphoniferous plant =虹吸植物
siphoniferous mechanism =虹吸机制
siphoniferous structure =虹吸结构
siphoniferous properties =虹吸特性
