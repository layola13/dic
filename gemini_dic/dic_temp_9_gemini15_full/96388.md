反义词：selective, discriminating, careful, judicious


词源:

* **in-**:  prefix meaning "not" or "without"
* **dis-**: prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of"
* **criminate**:  from Latin "crimen" meaning "accusation, charge," related to "cernere" meaning "to separate, distinguish."  Thus, "criminate" originally meant "to accuse, distinguish as guilty."

The word "indiscriminate" literally means "not able to distinguish," or "not making distinctions."  The modern meaning evolved from the original sense of not distinguishing between guilty and innocent to the broader sense of not making any distinctions at all.
