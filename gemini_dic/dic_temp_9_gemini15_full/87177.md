herderite:/ˈhɜːrdəraɪt/| n. |氟磷酸钙矿 | A relatively rare phosphate mineral consisting of calcium fluoro-phosphate.  It's often found in granitic pegmatites and is known for its distinctive green to yellow-green color, sometimes with bluish tints.  It's named after the German mineralogist Franz Herder. |The herderite specimen showed a beautiful, vibrant green hue.|近义词：暂无直接近义词，可根据具体语境用其他矿物名称代替 |反义词：暂无


USAGE->
