词源:
The word "curtsy" comes from the Middle English word "curtesie," meaning "courtesy" or "courteous behavior."  This, in turn, derives from the Old French word "courtoisie," which ultimately traces back to the Latin word "cortis," meaning "court."  The association with the court explains the connection to formal gestures of respect.  The verb form developed later from the noun.
