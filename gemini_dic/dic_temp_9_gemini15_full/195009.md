semiactivenesses:/ˌsɛmiˈæktɪvnəsɪz/| n. |半主动性；半活跃状态|The word "semiactivenesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a non-standard plural form of a non-standard word "semiactiveness," which itself is a combination of "semi-" (meaning half or partly) and "activeness" (a noun form of "active").  It attempts to describe instances or states of being partly active.  There is no established meaning or usage.  It would be better to use more precise and standard vocabulary to describe partial activity, such as "partial activations," "periods of low activity,"  or "intermittent activity." |The research explored various semiactivenesses in the network's response to queries. (This sentence uses the word, but its meaning is unclear and should be rewritten using standard terminology.)|近义词: partial activations, periods of low activity, intermittent activity |反义词: full activations, continuous activity |名词
