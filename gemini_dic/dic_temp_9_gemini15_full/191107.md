词源:
The word "scapegoat" comes from the ancient Hebrew ritual described in Leviticus 16.  In this ritual, a goat was chosen to symbolically carry away the sins of the Israelites.  The word is a combination of "scape," meaning "escape," and "goat."  The "scape" part is related to Old English "schapen," meaning "to shape or create," implying that the goat was "shaped" or designated for this purpose.  Over time, the term evolved to refer to any person or thing that bears the blame for others.
