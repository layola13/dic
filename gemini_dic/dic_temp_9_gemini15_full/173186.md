词源:
The word is a combination of "quasi," meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent," and "blindly," meaning "without seeing or understanding."  Therefore, "quasi-blindly" describes an action that is done with a lack of full awareness or understanding, similar to but not quite as extreme as being completely blind.
