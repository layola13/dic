词源:  The word "deframe" is a relatively modern coinage, likely formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "remove" or "reverse") to the word "frame," which in this context refers to the way something is presented or interpreted (often negatively).  Thus, "deframe" means to remove the negative framing.
