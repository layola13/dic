cyclonoscope:/ˈsaɪklənoʊskoʊp/| n. |旋风镜,气旋观测仪|A cyclonoscope is an instrument used to observe and study cyclones, particularly their atmospheric pressure and wind patterns. It typically involves a visual representation of the cyclone's structure and behavior.  |Example: The meteorologist used a cyclonoscope to track the intensity and movement of the approaching hurricane.|近义词: cyclone tracker, weather monitoring system|反义词: N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The cyclonoscope displays the current atmospheric pressure. = 旋风镜显示当前大气压力。
Scientists use cyclonoscopes to monitor weather patterns. = 科学家使用旋风镜监测天气模式。

一般过去时:
The meteorologist examined the cyclonoscope readings yesterday. = 气象学家昨天检查了旋风镜读数。
The old cyclonoscope malfunctioned during the storm. = 暴风雨期间旧的旋风镜发生故障。


现在完成时:
Researchers have developed more sophisticated cyclonoscopes. = 研究人员已经开发出更先进的旋风镜。
They have used the cyclonoscope to track several cyclones this year. = 今年他们已经使用旋风镜追踪了好几个气旋。


过去完成时:
Before the hurricane hit, they had checked the cyclonoscope for accuracy. = 在飓风来袭之前，他们检查了旋风镜的准确性。
The data from the cyclonoscope had already been analyzed. = 旋风镜的数据已经被分析过了。


将来时:
We will use the new cyclonoscope to predict the cyclone's path. = 我们将使用新的旋风镜来预测气旋的路径。
They will install advanced cyclonoscopes in coastal areas. = 他们将在沿海地区安装先进的旋风镜。


虚拟语气:
If we had a more advanced cyclonoscope, we could predict the storm more accurately. = 如果我们有一个更先进的旋风镜，我们可以更准确地预测风暴。
I wish we had access to a reliable cyclonoscope during the disaster. = 我希望在灾难期间我们能够使用可靠的旋风镜。


被动语态:
The cyclonoscope was calibrated before the experiment. = 旋风镜在实验前进行了校准。
The data is being analyzed by the cyclonoscope at this moment. = 数据正在由旋风镜分析。


疑问句:
What does the cyclonoscope indicate about the cyclone's intensity? = 旋风镜显示关于气旋强度的什么信息？
Is the cyclonoscope providing real-time data? = 旋风镜是否提供实时数据？


否定句:
The cyclonoscope did not detect any significant changes in pressure. = 旋风镜没有检测到任何显著的压力变化。
We do not have access to a sophisticated cyclonoscope at the moment. = 我们目前无法使用先进的旋风镜。


PHRASE->
cyclonoscope readings  旋风镜读数
advanced cyclonoscope 先进旋风镜
operate a cyclonoscope 操作旋风镜
calibrate a cyclonoscope 校准旋风镜
analyze cyclonoscope data 分析旋风镜数据
