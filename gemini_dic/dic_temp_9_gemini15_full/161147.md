/poʊstfɔːlts/ | n. | 震后断层; 余震断层 | Postfaults refer to faults that are formed or reactivated after a major earthquake.  These faults can be newly created fractures or pre-existing structures that experience renewed movement due to the stress changes caused by the main earthquake.  They often exhibit different characteristics from the main fault that caused the initial earthquake. | Example: The researchers identified several postfaults that extended outwards from the primary rupture zone of the earthquake.  研究人员发现了几个从地震的主要破裂带向外延伸的余震断层。 | 近义词: secondary faults, aftershocks (in a broader geological context) | 反义词:  pre-existing faults (in the context of formation relative to a specific earthquake)


USAGE->

This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations.  Therefore, tense-based conjugations (present, past, future, etc.) are not applicable.  However, it can be used in various sentence structures.


Example Sentences demonstrating usage:

Simple Sentence: Postfaults are a common feature in areas affected by large earthquakes. 余震断层是受大型地震影响地区的一个常见特征。

Complex Sentence: The team's analysis of the postfaults revealed a complex pattern of stress redistribution following the seismic event.  研究小组对余震断层的分析揭示了地震事件后应力重新分布的复杂模式。


Passive Voice: The formation of postfaults was carefully studied by the geologists.  地质学家仔细研究了余震断层的形成。

Active Voice: Geologists carefully studied the formation of the postfaults. 地质学家仔细研究了余震断层的形成。



PHRASE->

There are no common idiomatic phrases specifically using "postfaults."  The term is used primarily in a geological context.  Phrases related to the broader topic of earthquakes and fault lines might be more relevant, such as:

fault rupture  断层破裂
seismic activity 地震活动
earthquake hazard 地震危险
stress field 应力场
tectonic plate movement 构造板块运动
