self-weight:/ˈsɛlfˌweɪt/| n. |自重，自身重量 |The weight of an object due to the force of gravity acting upon it.  It excludes any external loads or forces. |例句：The self-weight of the bridge is a significant factor in its design.  桥的自重是其设计中的一个重要因素。

The self-weight of the building needs to be considered when calculating the foundation requirements. 建筑物的自重在计算地基要求时需要考虑。|近义词：dead weight, inherent weight|反义词：external load, applied load


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The self-weight of this component is 10kg. = 这个部件的自重是10公斤。
The bridge's self-weight significantly impacts its stability. = 桥的自重严重影响其稳定性。


一般过去时:

过去完成时:
The engineers had already factored in the self-weight before the design was finalized. = 工程师在设计定稿之前就已经考虑了自重。
They had underestimated the self-weight of the previous model. = 他们低估了先前型号的自重。


将来时:
The self-weight will be a major consideration in future designs. = 自重将成为未来设计中的一个主要考虑因素。
We will calculate the self-weight using a new software. = 我们将使用新的软件计算自重。


虚拟语气:
If the self-weight were higher, the structure would be less stable. = 如果自重更高，结构将不那么稳定。
If the self-weight had been properly calculated, the accident might have been avoided. = 如果自重计算正确，事故可能就会避免。


被动语态:

The self-weight was carefully considered during the structural analysis. = 在结构分析过程中，自重得到了仔细考虑。


疑问句:
What is the self-weight of the proposed building? = 拟建建筑物的自重是多少？
Has the self-weight of all components been accounted for? = 所有部件的自重都考虑了吗？


否定句:
The self-weight was not properly considered in the initial design. = 初始设计中没有正确考虑自重。
The self-weight does not include external loads. = 自重不包括外部载荷。
