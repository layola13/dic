词源:
The word "millionaire" is a combination of "million" and "-aire," a suffix indicating a person associated with or possessing something. "Million" comes from the Old French "million," ultimately from the Latin "mille" (thousand).  The "-aire" suffix has French origins as well, related to words like "maire" (mayor).  Therefore, the word literally means "a person who possesses a million."
