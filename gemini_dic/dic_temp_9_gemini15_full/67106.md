词源:
The word "exploring" comes from the Old French word "esplerer," meaning "to search, investigate," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "explōrāre," meaning "to search out, investigate."  The Latin word is formed from "ex-" (out, from) and "plōrāre" (to weep, cry out), suggesting an earlier meaning related to searching with cries or calls. Over time, the meaning shifted to the more general sense of exploration and investigation we use today.
