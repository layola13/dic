词源:
The word "exponentially" is derived from the word "exponent," which comes from the Latin word "expōnens," meaning "setting forth" or "explaining." In mathematics, an exponent indicates the power to which a number is raised.  Therefore, "exponentially" describes a growth or decay pattern that follows the mathematical principle of exponential functions.
