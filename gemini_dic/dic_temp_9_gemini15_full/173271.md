PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "quasi-constitutionally."  The word itself is used to describe a specific type of process or behavior.

WORD ORIGIN->
* **quasi-**:  from Latin *quasi* meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost."
* **constitutionally**: from "constitution," ultimately from Latin *constitutio*, meaning "a setting up," "establishment," or "arrangement."  The suffix "-ally" indicates in a manner of.

Therefore, "quasi-constitutionally" literally means "in a manner almost like a constitution."
