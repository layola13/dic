The word "jamess" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a proper noun (a name).  Therefore, a standard lexical analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need clarification:

1. **Is "jamess" a misspelling?** If so, what word were you intending to spell?  I can then provide the analysis for the correct word.

2. **Is "jamess" a proper noun (a name)?** If so, it's a variant spelling of the name James, possibly with an added 's' for pluralization (referring to multiple Jameses) or possibly a stylistic choice.  While I can't provide a dictionary definition, I can discuss the name's origin and usage.


Please clarify the intended meaning of "jamess" so I can give you a proper response.
