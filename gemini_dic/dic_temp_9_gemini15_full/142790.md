词源:  The word "ounce" comes from the Old French "once," which in turn derives from the Latin "uncia," meaning "twelfth part."  This refers to the Roman uncia, a twelfth of a Roman pound (as opposed to the modern avoirdupois pound).  The connection to "twelfth" explains the historical relationship between ounces and pounds.
