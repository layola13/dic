词源:
The word "paedophilia" comes from the Greek words *pais* (παις), meaning "child," and *philia* (φιλία), meaning "love" or "friendship."  Therefore, literally, it means "love of children." However, its modern usage refers specifically to a sexual attraction to prepubescent children, and is considered a mental disorder and a crime.
