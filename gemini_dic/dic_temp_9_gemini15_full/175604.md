The word "rangement" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a word like "arrangement," "range," or another similar-sounding word.

2. **A neologism or a word from a specialized field:** It might be a newly coined word or a term used within a specific area of study or profession that isn't widely known.

3. **A word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language that hasn't been integrated into English.


If you could provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more specific answer.  For example, knowing the sentence in which it appears would be very helpful.
