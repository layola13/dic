/daɪˈæmbəs/| n. |抑扬格|A diiambus is a metrical foot in poetry consisting of two unstressed syllables followed by two stressed syllables.  It's a less common metrical foot than others like iambs or trochees. |Example:  The word "di-i-AM-bus" itself, when stressed, roughly follows a diiambic pattern, though it is not a perfect example as the first syllable is somewhat stressed.|近义词:  (N/A -  Describes a metrical pattern, not a concept with direct synonyms)|反义词: (N/A -  Describes a metrical pattern, not a concept with direct antonyms)|名词


USAGE->
(Diambus itself is not a verb, adjective, etc., so no conjugation is applicable.  The usage example below demonstrates the diiambus in context.)


Example in Poetry:

While finding perfect examples of diiambic lines in established poetry is rare (as it is not a common meter), one could *construct* a line to illustrate:

"the  SMALL  est  FLOWer" (The stresses are indicated by capitalization)


This line attempts to follow a diiambic pattern but is not a perfect example in real poetic usage.


PHRASE->
(No common phrases directly using "diiambus" exist.  The word is a technical term in prosody.)
