词源:

The word "companionway" combines "companion" and "way."  "Companion" historically referred to a fellow traveler or associate, suggesting a shared passage. "Way" simply means a path or passage.  Therefore, a companionway is a passage shared by companions, or a passage to shared spaces on a ship.
