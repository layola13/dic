Word Origin:

The word "quasi-truthful" is a combination of two elements:

* **quasi-**:  A prefix of Latin origin meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "as if."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation to something but not a complete identity.

* **truthful**: An adjective meaning "telling the truth; honest."  It derives from the Old English words "trūþ" (truth) and "ful" (full, characterized by).


Therefore, "quasi-truthful" literally means "seemingly truthful" or "almost truthful," highlighting the imperfect or incomplete nature of the truthfulness.
