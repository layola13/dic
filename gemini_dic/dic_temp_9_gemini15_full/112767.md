词源:  The word "lubber" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "lubbe," meaning "a lazy, idle person."  This term likely has a connection to the Old Norse word "lubbi," also signifying a "clumsy person."  The insect larval sense developed later, likely reflecting the clumsy, slow movements of large insect larvae.
