词源:  The word "offal" originates from the Middle English "offal," meaning "waste," "refuse," or "garbage."  It’s ultimately derived from Old English "of-fall," a compound of "of" (from) and "fall" (fallen).  This reflects its historical association with the parts of an animal considered less valuable than the meat.
