词源:

The word "hippieish" is derived from "hippie," a term that emerged in the 1960s to describe members of the counterculture movement.  "Hippieish" adds the suffix "-ish," which indicates a resemblance to or a slight degree of the quality described by the base word.  The origin of "hippie" itself is less certain, with suggestions ranging from "hip" (meaning stylish or sophisticated) to a reference to "hipsters," an earlier generation of nonconformists.
