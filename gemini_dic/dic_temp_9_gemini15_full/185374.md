retrofract:/ˈrɛtroʊfrækt/ | vt. | 反折射，逆向折射 | To refract (light) backward or back upon itself.  Retrofraction is the bending of light back upon itself, often due to a change in the medium through which it is traveling. This can occur, for instance, when light passes from a denser to a less dense medium at a steep angle. | Example: The prism retrofracted the light, creating a dazzling display.  棱镜反折射了光线，创造出令人眼花缭乱的景象。

Example: The experiment demonstrated how a specific lens could retrofract a laser beam.  实验展示了某种特定透镜如何反折射激光束。
