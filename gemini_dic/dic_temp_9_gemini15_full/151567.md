词源:
From the word "part," meaning to divide or separate, combined with the suffix "-able," indicating capability.  The original sense suggested something that could be easily taken apart and reassembled for transport, leading to the modern meaning of easily carried or moved.  It's a relatively recent word, not found in older dictionaries.
