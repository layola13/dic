词源:
The word "deactuate" is a relatively recent coinage, formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "to reverse the action of") to "actuate."  "Actuate" itself comes from the Latin word "actuare," meaning "to put in motion" or "to do."  Therefore, "deactuate" literally means "to put out of motion" or "to undo the action of."
