/ˌnɑːnˌæbzənˈteɪʃənz/ | n. | 不缺勤；全勤 |  The word "nonabsentees" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, likely formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") with "absentees" (those who are absent).  It implies a state or group of people characterized by the absence of absences;  perfect attendance. There is no established usage or dictionary definition.  A more appropriate term would be "perfect attendance" or "full attendance". |例句：The teacher praised the class for their nonabsentees record this semester. (This sentence uses the made-up word, and a better phrasing would be: The teacher praised the class for their perfect attendance this semester.) |近义词：perfect attendance, full attendance |反义词：absenteeism, high absence rate |名词
