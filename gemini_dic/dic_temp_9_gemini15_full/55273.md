dissipationless: /ˌdɪsɪˈpeɪʃənles/ | adj. | 无耗散的，无损耗的 |  Lacking dissipation; not subject to dissipation or loss of energy.  This term often appears in physics and engineering contexts, describing systems or processes that do not lose energy to the environment. | Example: Superconductors exhibit dissipationless current flow.  超导体表现出无耗散电流流动。

The concept of dissipationless systems is a theoretical ideal in many cases, as all real-world systems experience some degree of energy loss. | 近义词: lossless, energy-conserving | 反义词: dissipative, lossy |

词源:
The word "dissipationless" is formed from the prefix "dissipation-" (meaning the act of dissipating or wasting) and the suffix "-less" (meaning without or lacking).  "Dissipation" itself comes from the Latin word "dissipare," meaning "to scatter," "to dispel," or "to waste."
