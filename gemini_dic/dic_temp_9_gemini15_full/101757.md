词源:
The word "irresponsibility" is formed from the prefix "ir-" (meaning "not"), the noun "responsibility," and the suffix "-ity" (forming nouns of quality or state).  "Responsibility" itself comes from the Latin "responsabilitas," derived from "respondere" (to respond, to answer for).  Therefore, "irresponsibility" literally means "the state of not being responsible."
