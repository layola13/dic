词源:
The word "iguanian" is derived from the genus name *Iguana*, itself originating from the Taíno word *iwana*. The Taíno were the indigenous people of the Caribbean islands, and their word for the lizard eventually made its way into Spanish and then other European languages. The suffix "-ian" is used to form adjectives indicating belonging to or characteristic of a particular group or place.
