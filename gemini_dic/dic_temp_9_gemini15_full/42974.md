词源:
The word "coverup" is a compound word formed from the verb "cover" and the noun "up". "Cover" meaning to place something over or on top of something else, and "up" indicating a concealing or hiding action.  The word evolved naturally from the literal meaning of covering something to the figurative meaning of concealing information.
