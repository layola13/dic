词源:

The word "loyalist" comes from the Middle English word "loyal," meaning "faithful" or "true," which in turn is derived from the Old French word "loyal" and ultimately from the Latin word "legalis," meaning "lawful" or "pertaining to law."  The "-ist" suffix is used to form nouns denoting people who adhere to a particular belief or practice.
