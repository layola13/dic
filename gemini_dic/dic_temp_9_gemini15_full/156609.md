picoline:/ˈpɪkəliːn/| n. |吡啶甲醇|Picoline is a generic name for any of the three isomeric methylpyridines.  These are organic compounds consisting of a pyridine ring with a methyl group attached. The three isomers are 2-picoline (α-picoline), 3-picoline (β-picoline), and 4-picoline (γ-picoline), differing in the position of the methyl group on the pyridine ring.|Example: 2-Picoline is used as an intermediate in the synthesis of various pharmaceuticals and pesticides.|近义词: methylpyridine |反义词: None
