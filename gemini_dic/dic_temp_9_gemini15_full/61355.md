/ˈɛmbəriz/ | n. | 余烬；余火；残余 |  The word "emberings" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  It seems to be a neologism, likely formed by adding the suffix "-ings" to "ember," suggesting a state or process related to embers.  Therefore, a definition and usage examples must be inferred from the root word "ember".  The meaning likely refers to the state of slowly dying embers, the process of something fading like embers, or the lingering effects of something intense, like the lingering effects of a fire. |  The dying embers glowed faintly.  (快要熄灭的余烬发出微弱的光。)


The lingering emberings of the argument continued to affect their relationship. (争论的残余影响继续影响着他们的关系。)
