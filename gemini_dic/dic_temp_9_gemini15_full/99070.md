/ˌɪntərəˈtrɪʃənz/ | n. |相互摩擦；相互磨损 |The word "interattrition" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, formed by combining "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and "attrition" (meaning "the process of gradually reducing something's strength or effectiveness").  Therefore, a precise definition and usage examples cannot be provided. However, based on its component parts, it could be interpreted to mean the gradual weakening or wearing down of something through mutual interaction or conflict. |例句：The prolonged negotiations resulted in interattrition between the two companies, weakening their respective positions. (长时间的谈判导致两家公司之间相互磨损，削弱了各自的地位。)  |近义词: mutual wear, reciprocal erosion,  inter-conflict,  |反义词: mutual strengthening, cooperation, synergy |n.
