词源:
The word "poesies" is the plural of "poesy," which comes from the Middle French *poesie*, ultimately derived from the Old French *poesie* and the Latin *poēsis*.  The Latin word *poēsis* itself comes from the Greek *poiesis* (ποίησις), meaning "a making," "a creation," or "poetry."  Therefore, "poesies" literally refers to "creations" or "works of poetry."
