scorification:/ˌskɔːrɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/| n.| 矿石烧结；熔渣化 | The process of heating a mineral or ore, usually with a flux, to form a slag.  This process is used in metallurgy to separate valuable metals from unwanted materials. | Example: Scorification is a common method used in assaying gold ores.  矿石烧结是分析黄金矿石的常用方法。 |近义词：smelting, fusion |反义词：None.
