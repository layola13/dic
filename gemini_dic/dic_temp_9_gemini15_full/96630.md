词源:  The word "indulto" comes from the Late Latin word *indultu*, which is the past participle of *indulgere*, meaning "to indulge," "to grant," or "to pardon." This ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *dʰeh₁- , meaning "to give."  The word entered English through Spanish and Italian.
