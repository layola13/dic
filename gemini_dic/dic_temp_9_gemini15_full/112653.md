词源:  The term is a compound word formed from "low" and "brow."  "Brow" in this context refers to the forehead, and the implication is that those with "low brows" are perceived as intellectually or culturally inferior.  The metaphorical use likely developed in the 19th century, reflecting social class distinctions and the rise of intellectual movements.
