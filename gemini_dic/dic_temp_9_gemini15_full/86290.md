词源:  The word is a compound of "heavy" (meaning weighty or substantial) and "set" (referring to a person's build or physique). The "set" in this context is likely related to the older meaning of "set" as a fixed or established state or condition.  Therefore, "heavy-set" describes someone whose physical form is characterized by heaviness or substantial build.
