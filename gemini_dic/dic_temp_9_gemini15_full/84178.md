词源：

* **half-**:  Prefix meaning "partially" or "to a certain extent."  Derived from Old English *healf*.

* **provocative**:  Derived from the verb "provoke," which comes from the Latin *provocāre* (to call forth, challenge).  This further derives from *pro-*(forward) + *vocāre* (to call).  Thus, "provocative" means "tending to provoke or stimulate."
