The word "makes-with" does not exist as a single, established word in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a phrasal verb or a newly coined term.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and formal grammatical breakdown are impossible.  However, we can analyze its potential meaning and usage based on its component parts.


**Analysis of Potential Meaning and Usage:**

The phrase "makes with" appears to be a colloquial and informal way of expressing the action of producing or creating something, often with a sense of emphasis or flair. It implies a more active and deliberate creation than a simple "makes."

**Possible Interpretations:**

* **Emphasis on the act of creation:**  "He makes with the most amazing pasta dishes!" (He actively and skillfully makes pasta dishes).  The "with" adds a sense of gusto or expertise.

* **Using a particular method or tool:** "She makes with a whisk and a lot of butter!" (She uses a whisk and lots of butter in her baking).  The "with" specifies the instruments used.

* **Sudden or enthusiastic creation:** "Suddenly, she makes with a grand flourish, revealing a magnificent cake!" (She suddenly and dramatically reveals a cake).  The "with" emphasizes the unexpected and impressive nature of the action.


**Hypothetical Grammatical Aspects (if considered a phrasal verb):**

* **Word Class:**  Phrasal Verb (informal)
* **Translation:**  Depending on context, it might translate to "creates with," "makes using," "produces with," or even "performs with."

**Note:**  The absence of this phrase in standard dictionaries highlights its informal and possibly regional nature.  Its use should be confined to casual conversation or informal writing.  In formal contexts, clearer and more conventional phrasing should be preferred.
