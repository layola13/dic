词源:

The word "proconstitutionalism" is a modern coinage, a combination of "pro-" (in favor of) and "constitutionalism" (adherence to a constitution and its principles).  "Constitutionalism" itself derives from "constitution," ultimately from the Latin "constitutio," meaning "a setting up, establishment."
