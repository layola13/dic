noncondensing: /ˌnɒnkənˈdensɪŋ/ | adj. |不凝结的；非凝结的| Not undergoing condensation;  referring to a system or process where vapor (typically steam) is not allowed to condense and release its latent heat.  This typically means the exhaust gases are released directly into the atmosphere at a high temperature. |例句：The noncondensing boiler operates at a higher temperature than a condensing boiler.  非凝结锅炉的工作温度高于凝结锅炉。|近义词：non-condensing|反义词：condensing


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The noncondensing unit heats the room efficiently. = 非凝结式装置有效地加热房间。
This system remains noncondensing throughout its operation. = 该系统在整个运行过程中保持不凝结状态。


一般过去时:
The old boiler was a noncondensing model. = 旧锅炉是非凝结式型号。
The engineer confirmed that the exhaust was noncondensing. = 工程师确认废气是不凝结的。


现在完成时:
The plant has used noncondensing turbines for decades. = 该工厂几十年来一直使用非凝结式涡轮机。
They have successfully implemented a noncondensing process. = 他们成功地实施了非凝结过程。


过去完成时:
Before the upgrade, the system had been noncondensing. = 在升级之前，系统一直是不凝结的。
The company had already installed a noncondensing unit. = 公司已经安装了一个非凝结式装置。


将来时:
The new factory will utilize noncondensing technology. = 新工厂将采用非凝结技术。
We will install a noncondensing boiler next month. = 我们下个月将安装一台非凝结式锅炉。


虚拟语气:
If it were a noncondensing system, the efficiency would be lower. = 如果是无凝结系统，效率就会降低。
I wish the new system were noncondensing for better performance. = 我希望新系统是非凝结式的，以获得更好的性能。


被动语态:
The exhaust gases are released directly into the atmosphere in a noncondensing process. = 在非凝结过程中，废气直接排放到大气中。
Noncondensing technology is increasingly being employed in industrial settings. = 非凝结技术正越来越多地应用于工业环境中。


疑问句:
Is this a condensing or a noncondensing system? = 这是一个凝结系统还是一个非凝结系统？
Are there any disadvantages to using a noncondensing boiler? = 使用非凝结式锅炉有什么缺点吗？


否定句:
This boiler is not noncondensing; it's a condensing type. = 这台锅炉不是非凝结式的；它是凝结式的。
The process is not designed to be noncondensing. = 该过程并非设计为非凝结的。


PHRASE->
noncondensing boiler 非凝结锅炉
noncondensing turbine 非凝结式涡轮机
noncondensing exhaust 非凝结废气
noncondensing engine 非凝结式发动机
noncondensing steam system 非凝结式蒸汽系统

词源:
The word "noncondensing" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "condensing," which derives from the verb "condense," ultimately from Latin "condensare," meaning "to thicken, compress."  Therefore, "noncondensing" literally means "not thickening" or "not undergoing condensation" in the context of vapor.
