词源:
The word "set-up" originates from the verb "set," meaning to place or arrange something, combined with "up," indicating a completion or upward motion.  The combined meaning developed over time to encompass the act of arranging and preparing something for a specific purpose.  The noun usage evolved from the verbal usage, referring to the result of the arranging and preparation – the arrangement or structure itself.
