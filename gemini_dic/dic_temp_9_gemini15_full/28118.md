词源:
From *capital* + *-ness*.  "Capital" itself has a complex etymology, ultimately deriving from the Latin *capitalis*, meaning "of the head," "chief," or "principal." The suffix "-ness" forms abstract nouns of quality or state.  Therefore, "capitalness" literally means "the state or quality of being capital" in the sense of being of primary importance or significance.
