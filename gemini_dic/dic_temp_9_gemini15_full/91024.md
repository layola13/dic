The word "hushest" does not exist as a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specific dialect or context.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need clarification on the intended word or context in which you encountered "hushest."  Was it perhaps meant to be one of the following?


* **Hush:** /hʌʃ/ | v. n. |  使安静；安静 | To make or become quiet. |  "Hush the baby." (使婴儿安静)  "There was a hush in the room." (房间里一片寂静) |  近义词: silence, quiet, still | 反义词: noisy, loud |
* **Hushes:** /ˈhʌʃɪz/ | n. | 安静声；寂静 | The act of becoming quiet, or a period of quiet. | "The sudden hushes were unnerving." (突然的寂静令人不安)| 近义词: silences, quiets | 反义词: noises, loud sounds |

If "hushest" was intended as a made-up word, perhaps it's meant to be a superlative form of "hush," implying the quietest state possible.  However, this is purely speculative.  Please provide more context.
