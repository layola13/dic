词源:The term "off-licence" is a compound of "off" and "licence".  "Off" refers to the consumption of alcohol *off* the premises where it is sold, as opposed to an "on-licence" which allows consumption on the premises (like a pub or bar). "Licence" (or "license" in American English) refers to the legal permission to sell alcohol.  The term originated in the UK and reflects its specific alcohol licensing laws.
