pseudo-proposition:/ˌsuːdoʊˌprɑːpəˈzɪʃən/| n. |伪命题，似是而非的命题 | A statement that appears to be a proposition (a statement that can be true or false), but lacks the necessary logical structure or meaning to be meaningfully evaluated as true or false.  It might be grammatically correct but semantically meaningless, or it might involve a contradiction or a fallacy. | Example: "The round square is blue." This appears to be a statement about a shape's color, but it's logically impossible for a square to be round, rendering the entire statement meaningless. | 近义词:paradox, fallacy, absurdity | 反义词:proposition, truth, valid statement |
