词性：形容词


词源:

* **quasi-**:  from Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."  This prefix indicates something that resembles or approximates a particular quality but isn't fully that quality.

* **dutifully**: from "duty," ultimately from Old French *devoir* and Latin *dēbēre*, meaning "to owe."  "-fully" is an adverbial suffix indicating "in a ... manner."

因此，quasi-dutifully 字面意思就是“几乎是尽责地”，但实际上强调的是行动中缺乏真正的热情和投入。
