neoblast:/ˈniːoʊblæst/| n. |成体干细胞，新生细胞|A neoblast is a type of totipotent stem cell found in planarians and other flatworms.  They are responsible for regeneration and asexual reproduction in these animals.  Neoblasts are capable of differentiating into any cell type in the organism and are crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis. |Example: The high regenerative capacity of planarians is attributed to the activity of their neoblasts.  (涡虫强大的再生能力归因于其成体干细胞的活性。) |近义词:pluripotent stem cell, totipotent stem cell|反义词:differentiated cell


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Neoblasts constantly divide and differentiate. = 成体干细胞不断分裂和分化。
Planarians use neoblasts for tissue repair. = 涡虫利用成体干细胞进行组织修复。

一般过去时:
Researchers studied the role of neoblasts in regeneration. = 研究人员研究了成体干细胞在再生中的作用。

将来时:
Future research will focus on manipulating neoblasts for therapeutic purposes. = 未来的研究将集中在操纵成体干细胞用于治疗目的。
Scientists will investigate the signaling pathways involved in neoblast differentiation. = 科学家将研究参与成体干细胞分化的信号通路。

虚拟语气:

否定句:
Neoblasts do not spontaneously differentiate in normal conditions. = 在正常条件下，成体干细胞不会自发分化。
The absence of neoblasts prevents successful regeneration. = 缺乏成体干细胞会阻止成功的再生。
