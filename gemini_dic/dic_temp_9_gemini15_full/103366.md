This request is impossible to fulfill.  The entry "jinan" as provided does not represent a single English word with a definable etymology, grammatical properties, and usage.  "Jinan" is a proper noun, referring to the city of Jinan in China.  It's not an English word and therefore doesn't fit the requested format.  To analyze a word, I need an actual English word as input.
