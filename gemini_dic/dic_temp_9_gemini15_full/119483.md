microns:/ˈmaɪkrɑːnz/ | n. | 微米；百万分之一米 | A micron is a unit of length equal to one millionth of a meter.  Microns are commonly used to measure very small objects or distances, such as the size of dust particles or the thickness of a human hair. | The dust particles were measured in microns.  尘埃颗粒是用微米来测量的。 The coating on the lens is only a few microns thick.  镜片上的涂层只有几微米厚。 | micrometer, micrometre | millimeter, centimeter |  n.
