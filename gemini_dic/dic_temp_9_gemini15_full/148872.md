词源:  The word derives from the adjective "overweening," which itself is a combination of "over" (meaning "excessively") and "weening," an older word meaning "to think," "to imagine," or "to suppose."  Thus, "overweening" means "thinking too highly of oneself," and "overweeningness" is the noun form, indicating the state of being overweening.  The 's' at the end is the possessive case.
