词源:
The word "recensors" is derived from the verb "censor," which originates from the Latin word "censor," meaning "tax assessor" or "examiner."  Over time, the meaning shifted to include the examination and suppression of objectionable material. The prefix "re-" emphasizes the repeated or thorough nature of the examination.
