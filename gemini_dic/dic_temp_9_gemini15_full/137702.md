Word Origin:
The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "usuriousness" (meaning the quality or state of being usurious, i.e., involving usury).  Usury itself derives from the Latin word "usura," meaning "use," referring to the use of money in lending.  The evolution of the word reflects the historical and ongoing concern about exploitative lending practices.
