friction:/ˈfrɪkʃən/ | n. |摩擦；摩擦力；冲突；不和 |The resistance that one surface or object encounters when moving over another.  Friction is caused by the irregularities in the surfaces of the objects.  For example, when you rub your hands together, you feel the friction.  In a broader sense, friction can also refer to disagreements or conflicts between people or groups. |例句：The friction between the two moving parts caused the machine to overheat.  两个运动部件之间的摩擦导致机器过热。

The friction between the two political parties made it difficult to pass legislation. 两个政党之间的摩擦使得立法变得困难。|近义词：resistance, rubbing, conflict, discord |反义词：smoothness, harmony, agreement
