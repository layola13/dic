conicoid:/ˈkɒnɪkɔɪd/| n.|圆锥曲线体；二次曲面|A conicoid is a quadric surface; that is, a surface defined by a second-degree equation in three variables.  Conicoids include ellipsoids, paraboloids, and hyperboloids.  They are three-dimensional analogues of conic sections. |The geometer studied the properties of various conicoids. 几何学家研究了各种圆锥曲面的性质。|近义词：quadric surface|反义词：无
