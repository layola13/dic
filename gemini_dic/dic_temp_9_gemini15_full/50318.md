词源：

The word "deplorableness" is derived from the verb "deplore," which comes from the Old French word "deplorer," meaning "to lament," "to bewail," or "to regret deeply."  The suffix "-ableness" transforms the verb into a noun, indicating the state or quality of being deplorable.  Ultimately, the roots trace back to the Latin word "plorare," meaning "to weep" or "to cry."
