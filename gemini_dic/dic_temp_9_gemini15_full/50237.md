词源:  The word "dependency" comes from the Old French word "dependance," which in turn derives from the Latin word "dependentia," meaning "hanging down from,"  "depending on." The Latin word is formed from the verb "pendere," meaning "to hang," and the prefix "de-," indicating "from" or "away from."  Therefore, the core meaning relates to something hanging or relying upon something else.
