词源:
The word "interstice" comes from the Late Latin word *interstitium*, which is a noun of action from the verb *interstitio*, meaning "to stand between."  *Interstitio* itself is derived from the Latin preposition *inter* ("between") and the verb *sisto* ("to stand" or "to place"). Therefore, the word literally means "a place where things stand between."
