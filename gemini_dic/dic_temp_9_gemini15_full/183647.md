词源:
The word "reregistration's" is formed by combining the prefix "re-" (meaning "again"), the noun "registration" (the act of registering), and the possessive suffix "-'s" (indicating possession).  "Registration" itself comes from the verb "register," ultimately derived from Latin "registrare" (to register, enroll).
