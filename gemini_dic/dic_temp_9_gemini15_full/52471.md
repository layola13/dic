词源:

The word "dietarian" is derived from the word "diet," ultimately from the ancient Greek word "diaita" (διαίτα), meaning "way of life," "manner of living," or "regimen."  The suffix "-arian" denotes a person who practices or is associated with something.  Thus, a "dietarian" is someone who follows a particular diet or is involved in the study and practice of dietetics.
