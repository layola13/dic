词源:

The word "jive" originates from African American Vernacular English (AAVE). Its etymology is uncertain, but it's believed to have evolved from earlier slang terms associated with lively talk or deceptive language.  The dance style known as the "jive" emerged in the 1930s and 40s, borrowing the word's association with energy and movement.  The slang meaning of "to deceive" is a later development.
