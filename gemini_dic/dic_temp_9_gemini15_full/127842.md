词源:  The word "nemesis" originates from the Greek goddess Nemesis, who personified divine retribution against excessive pride and ambition.  The Greek word "Némesis" (Νέμεσις) meant "retribution," "vengeance," or "divine punishment."  The meaning shifted over time to refer to a persistent rival or an insurmountable obstacle.
