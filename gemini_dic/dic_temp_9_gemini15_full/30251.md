cellulosities:/ˌsɛljuˈlɒsɪtiz/| n.|纤维素性质；纤维素的特性|The term refers to the properties and characteristics associated with cellulose, a complex carbohydrate that forms the main structural component of plant cell walls.  It encompasses aspects like its chemical structure, physical properties (e.g., insolubility in water, high tensile strength), and biological functions.|The study of cellulosities is crucial in understanding plant biology and the development of biofuels and other cellulose-derived materials.|近义词：cellulose properties, cellulosic characteristics|反义词：无


USAGE->

This word, "cellulosities," is relatively uncommon and doesn't readily lend itself to typical grammatical usages like tense variations.  The grammatical structures would apply to sentences *about* cellulosities, not to the word itself as a verb or other part of speech.  Examples using the word are provided below.

一般现在时:
The researcher studies the cellulosities of various plant species. = 研究人员研究各种植物的纤维素特性。
The experiment investigates the impact of temperature on cellulosities. = 实验研究温度对纤维素特性的影响。

一般过去时:
Scientists analyzed the cellulosities of ancient wood samples. = 科学家分析了古代木材样本的纤维素特性。
The report detailed the unique cellulosities of bamboo. = 报告详细介绍了竹子的独特纤维素特性。

现在完成时:
Researchers have discovered new aspects of cellulosities in recent years. = 近年来，研究人员发现了纤维素特性的新方面。
We have examined the cellulosities of several types of cotton fibers. = 我们检查了几种棉纤维的纤维素特性。

过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had already characterized the cellulosities of the material. = 在实验之前，他们已经表征了材料的纤维素特性。
Scientists had previously observed these unusual cellulosities in only a few species. = 科学家之前只在少数物种中观察到这些不寻常的纤维素特性。


将来时:
Future research will explore the potential applications of these cellulosities. = 未来的研究将探索这些纤维素特性的潜在应用。
We will analyze the cellulosities of the samples using advanced techniques. = 我们将使用先进技术分析样品的纤维素特性。


虚拟语气:
If the cellulosities were different, the material's properties would also change. = 如果纤维素特性不同，材料的特性也会改变。
It is essential that the cellulosities be carefully measured. = 必须仔细测量纤维素特性。


被动语态:
The cellulosities of the sample were carefully measured. = 样品的纤维素特性被仔细测量。
The impact of various treatments on cellulosities is being investigated. = 各种处理对纤维素特性的影响正在被研究。


疑问句:
What are the key cellulosities influencing the strength of this fiber? = 影响这种纤维强度的关键纤维素特性是什么？
How do the cellulosities of this plant differ from those of others? = 这种植物的纤维素特性与其他植物有何不同？


否定句:
The study did not find any significant differences in cellulosities between the two groups. = 这项研究没有发现两组之间纤维素特性有任何显著差异。
The results did not support the hypothesis about cellulosities. = 结果不支持关于纤维素特性的假设。


PHRASE->
There are not common phrases directly using "cellulosities."  Phrases would instead involve the properties of cellulose itself.  Examples are:

cellulose structure = 纤维素结构
cellulose degradation = 纤维素降解
cellulose biosynthesis = 纤维素生物合成
cellulose fibers = 纤维素纤维
cellulose content = 纤维素含量
