词源:
The word "inflammable" comes from the Latin word "inflammare," meaning "to set on fire."  The prefix "in-" in this context doesn't mean "not," but rather "in" or "on,"  similar to its use in words like "invade" or "incorporate."  Over time, the word evolved into its modern English form.  Note that while “inflammable” and “flammable” are often used interchangeably, “inflammable” is considered slightly more formal.
