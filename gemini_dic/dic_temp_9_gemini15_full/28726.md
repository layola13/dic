词源:
The word "carnal" comes from the Late Latin word *carnalis*, which means "of or pertaining to the flesh". This word, in turn, is derived from the Latin word *caro*, meaning "flesh".  The connection to the concept of "flesh" highlights the word's association with physicality and earthly desires, as opposed to spiritual matters.
