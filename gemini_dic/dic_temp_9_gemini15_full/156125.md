词源:
The word "photostatting" is derived from "Photostat," which was a brand name for a type of photocopying machine.  The brand name became so commonly used that it transitioned into a generic term for the process of photocopying.  It combines "photo" (light) and "stat" (short for "static," referring to the electrostatic process involved in early photocopying).
