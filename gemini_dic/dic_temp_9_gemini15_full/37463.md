词源:
The word "commissional" is derived from the noun "commission," meaning an instruction, command, or the act of giving someone a task or authority.  The suffix "-al" transforms the noun into an adjective, indicating a quality or relation to the commission.  The ultimate origin traces back to the Latin word "commissio," meaning "a committing, entrusting."
