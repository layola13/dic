cadaverine:/kəˈdævərɪn/| n. |尸胺|A foul-smelling diamine, NH2(CH2)5NH2, formed by the putrefaction of animal tissues.|例句：The pungent odor of cadaverine is a telltale sign of decomposition. 尸胺的强烈气味是腐烂的明显标志。The presence of cadaverine in the sample confirmed the advanced state of decay. 样本中尸胺的存在证实了腐烂的严重程度。|近义词：putrescine|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The cadaverine contributes to the foul smell of decaying flesh. = 尸胺导致腐烂的肉发出恶臭。
Cadaverine is a diamine formed during putrefaction. = 尸胺是一种在腐烂过程中形成的二胺。

一般过去时:
Scientists identified cadaverine in the decomposed remains. = 科学家在腐烂的遗骸中发现了尸胺。
The experiment showed that cadaverine levels increased with time. = 实验表明，尸胺的含量随时间增加。

现在完成时:
Researchers have studied the role of cadaverine in decomposition. = 研究人员已经研究了尸胺在分解中的作用。
We have detected elevated levels of cadaverine in this sample. = 我们在这个样本中检测到高浓度的尸胺。

过去完成时:
The investigators had already found evidence of cadaverine before the autopsy. = 验尸前，调查人员已经发现了尸胺的证据。
They had suspected cadaverine was present before conducting the tests. = 在进行测试之前，他们怀疑存在尸胺。

将来时:
Scientists will analyze the cadaverine content to determine the time of death. = 科学家将分析尸胺含量以确定死亡时间。
The study will investigate the effects of cadaverine on surrounding tissues. = 这项研究将调查尸胺对周围组织的影响。

虚拟语气:
If the cadaverine concentration were higher, the smell would be more intense. = 如果尸胺浓度更高，气味就会更强烈。
I wish we had not detected such a high level of cadaverine. = 我真希望我们没有检测到这么高浓度的尸胺。

被动语态:
Cadaverine is produced by bacterial action on dead tissue. = 尸胺是由细菌作用于死组织产生的。
The sample was analyzed for the presence of cadaverine. = 样本被分析以检测尸胺的存在。

疑问句:
Is cadaverine always present in decaying matter? = 尸胺总是在腐烂物质中存在吗？
What other compounds are formed alongside cadaverine during decomposition? = 在分解过程中，除了尸胺以外还形成了哪些化合物？

否定句:
The analysis did not reveal any significant quantities of cadaverine. = 分析没有发现任何大量的尸胺。
This sample does not contain detectable levels of cadaverine. = 这个样本不含可检测到的尸胺。


PHRASE->
cadaverine production = 尸胺产生
cadaverine concentration = 尸胺浓度
cadaverine detection = 尸胺检测
cadaverine levels = 尸胺水平
cadaverine analysis = 尸胺分析
