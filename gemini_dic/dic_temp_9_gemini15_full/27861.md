词源：

The word "canon" comes from the Greek word κανών (kanōn), meaning "straight rod," "ruler," or "standard."  This original meaning reflects its use as a standard or rule.  Its ecclesiastical use developed from the idea of a "rule of faith" or a list of authoritative books (the Bible).  The meaning of "large gun" developed later, possibly from the straight, cylindrical shape of the barrel.
