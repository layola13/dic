词源:
The word "overhoused" is a relatively modern compound word formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the noun "housed" (past participle of "house," meaning "to provide with a dwelling").  It reflects a contemporary concern about housing surplus or disproportionate living space.
