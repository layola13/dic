词源:
The word "loggerheaded" ultimately derives from "loggerhead," referring to a type of sea turtle known for its large head and slow movements. The association of the turtle's physical characteristics with a lack of intelligence led to the figurative use of "loggerheaded" to describe someone as stupid or clumsy.
