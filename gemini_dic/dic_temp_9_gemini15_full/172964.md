词源:  The word "quandary" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "quadrare," meaning "to square,"  or "to make square." This likely refers to the attempt to reconcile conflicting or incompatible elements in a difficult situation, as if trying to fit square pegs into round holes.  The meaning evolved over time to its current sense of a state of perplexity or uncertainty.
