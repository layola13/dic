PHRASE->
There are limited phrases specifically using "nonhandicapped," as it's an outdated term.  More inclusive phrasing is recommended.  However, examples could include:


Nonhandicapped access:  非残疾人通道 (but "accessible access" or "universal access" is preferred)
Nonhandicapped parking: 非残疾人停车位 (but "standard parking" or "general parking" is preferred)
Nonhandicapped facilities: 非残疾人设施 (but "accessible facilities" or "universal facilities" is preferred)

Activities for nonhandicapped children: 非残疾儿童活动 (but "activities for children" or "inclusive activities for children" is preferred)


词源:
The word is a compound of "non-" (meaning "not") and "handicapped" (referring to a person with a disability).  The term reflects the historical and now largely outdated approach to describing people with disabilities by what they lack rather than focusing on their abilities and experiences.
