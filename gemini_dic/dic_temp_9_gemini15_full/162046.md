pre-ammonites:/ˌpriːˈæmənaɪts/| n. | 前菊石类 | Pre-ammonites are extinct cephalopod mollusks that existed before the appearance of true ammonites. They represent an earlier stage in the evolutionary lineage of ammonoids, showing some characteristics of ammonites but lacking others.  They are often characterized by simpler shell structures and suture patterns compared to their later ammonite relatives.  Their fossil record helps paleontologists understand the evolutionary development of ammonoids. | The discovery of pre-ammonites in this formation pushed back the known timeline for ammonoid evolution. = 在这个地层中发现的前菊石类将已知的菊石类进化时间线提前了。|  early ammonoids, ancestral ammonoids |  ammonites |
