lipase:/ˈlaɪpeɪs/ | n. |脂肪酶| An enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of fats (lipids). Lipases are essential for the digestion and absorption of fats in the body. They break down triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol, which can then be used for energy or stored for later use.  Different types of lipases exist, each with a specific function and location in the body. For example, pancreatic lipase plays a crucial role in the digestion of dietary fats in the small intestine. |例句：Pancreatic lipase is crucial for the digestion of fats.  胰腺脂肪酶对脂肪的消化至关重要。

The deficiency of lipase can lead to malabsorption of fats. 脂肪酶缺乏会导致脂肪吸收不良。|近义词：esterase |反义词：无
