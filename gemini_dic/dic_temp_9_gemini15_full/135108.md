Word Origin:

The word is formed by combining several morphemes:

* **non-**: a prefix indicating negation or absence.
* **obsessiveness**:  derived from "obsessive," which itself comes from the Latin "obsidere" (to besiege).  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "obsessive" into a noun, signifying a state or quality.  The further suffix "-es" creates the plural.


Therefore, "nonobsessivenesses" literally means "the multiple states or qualities of not being obsessed."
