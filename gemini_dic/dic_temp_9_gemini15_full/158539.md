词源:  The word "plerophory" derives from the Greek word "πληροφορία" (plērophoría), which is a combination of "πλήρης" (plērēs) meaning "full" or "complete" and "φέρω" (pherō) meaning "to bear" or "to carry." Thus, the original meaning suggests "completely filled" or "fully informed."  Its use in English reflects this original sense of complete satisfaction and fulfillment.
