词源：

The word is derived from the adjective "intolerable" which combines the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") with the word "tolerable" (meaning "able to be endured").  The suffix "-ities" forms the plural noun, indicating multiple instances of intolerability.  Ultimately, it traces back to the Latin word "tolerare" (to bear, endure).
