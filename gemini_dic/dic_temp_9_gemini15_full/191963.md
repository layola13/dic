scopuliped:/ˈskɒpjʊlɪped/ | n. |具柄足的 |A scopuliped is a type of arthropod with brush-like appendages used for locomotion or other functions.  The term often refers to specific groups within the crustaceans, particularly amphipods.  The "scopa" refers to the brush-like structure, and "ped" refers to the foot or appendage. | Example: Some amphipods possess specialized scopulipeds for filter feeding.  某些片脚类动物拥有特化的具柄足用于滤食。|近义词:  (depending on the specific arthropod)  pleopod, pereiopod |反义词: N/A
