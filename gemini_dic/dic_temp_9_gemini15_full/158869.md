plumosite:/ˈpluːmoʊsaɪt/| n. |羽状矿物|A mineral consisting of lead sulfide (PbS), usually occurring in acicular (needle-like) crystals that form radiating or feathery aggregates.  It is a variety of galena with a fibrous structure. |Plumosite is a rare mineral found in hydrothermal veins.  The acicular crystals often create a visually striking, feather-like appearance.|  近义词: galena (as a broader category)| 反义词: N/A
