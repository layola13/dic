quantum-mechanically: /ˈkwɑːntəm məˈkænɪkli/ | adv. | 量子力学地 |  Adverb describing something done or existing according to the principles of quantum mechanics.  It signifies an explanation or process based on the laws governing the behavior of matter at the atomic and subatomic levels.  | Example: The system behaves quantum-mechanically under these conditions.  这个系统在这些条件下表现出量子力学行为。 | 近义词:quantum mechanically | 反义词:classically

词源:

* **quantum:**  From Latin *quantus* meaning "how much," "how great." This refers to the discrete units of energy, momentum, etc., in quantum mechanics.

* **mechanically:** From "mechanic" (derived from Greek *mēkhanikos*, related to *mēkhanē*, "machine, device") + "-ally" (adverbial suffix).  This signifies a process or action according to mechanical principles.

The combination thus indicates a process or description adhering to the principles of quantum mechanics, a theory dealing with the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels.
