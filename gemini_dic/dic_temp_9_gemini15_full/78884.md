The word "ginnee" does not appear to be a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "genie," "gin," or another word entirely.  Please double-check the spelling.

2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name, a place name, or a brand name specific to a certain region or context.

3. **It's slang or dialect:** It could be an informal word or term used within a specific community or region.

4. **It's a neologism:** A newly coined word not yet widely adopted.
