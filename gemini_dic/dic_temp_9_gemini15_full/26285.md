词源:

The word "buttressless" is formed by adding the negative prefix "less" to the noun "buttress."  "Buttress" itself comes from Old French "bouter," meaning "to push," and ultimately from Latin "buttare," meaning "to thrust."  Thus, "buttress" originally referred to something that pushed or supported something else.  The addition of "-less" signifies the absence of such support.
