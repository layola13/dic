The word "crosshatching" is a compound word formed from "cross" (meaning "across" or "intersecting") and "hatching," which refers to the technique of creating shading or texture with closely spaced parallel lines.  The "-ing" suffix indicates the action or process.  Therefore, "crosshatching" literally means the process of creating shading or texture with intersecting lines.
