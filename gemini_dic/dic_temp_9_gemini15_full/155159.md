词源:

Petulance derives from the Late Latin word *petulantia*,  meaning "sauciness, insolence," which in turn comes from the Latin word *petulans*, meaning "saucy, insolent, wanton."  The root is likely connected to the Proto-Indo-European root *pet-, meaning "to rush, to fly."  This suggests an association with impetuous or rash behavior.
