词源:
Comes from the verb "commiserate," which itself originates from the Late Latin word "commiserari," meaning "to share sorrow" or "to feel pity."  The prefix "com-" means "together," and "miserari" is related to "miser," meaning "wretched" or "unhappy."  Therefore, the word's roots suggest a feeling of shared unhappiness or pity.
