词源:
From "Scyphozoa" (a class of jellyfish) + "-medusa" (referring to the medusa stage of the life cycle).  "Scyphozoa" itself is derived from Greek *skyphos* ("cup, bowl") referring to the bell shape of the jellyfish.  "-medusa" comes from the Gorgon Medusa of Greek mythology, perhaps reflecting the jellyfish's potentially dangerous tentacles.
