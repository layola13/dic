词源:

The word "operably" derives from the verb "operate," ultimately from the Latin "operari" meaning "to work" or "to labor."  The suffix "-ably" transforms the verb into an adverb, indicating a manner or condition of operating.  The transition to an adjective, describing something capable of being operated, is a common grammatical shift in English.
