词源:
The word "overweeningly" derives from the adjective "overweening," which itself comes from the Old English "oferwenan," meaning "to overpower, overcome." The "over" prefix emphasizes excess, while "weening" relates to "ween," an older word meaning "to think," "to believe," or "to imagine." Thus, "overweening" originally meant "thinking oneself too highly," leading to the modern sense of excessive pride or confidence.
