rebegan:/ˌriːbɪˈɡæn/| v.|重新开始，再开始|The word "rebegan" is not a standard English word.  It's an irregular and rarely used form of "begin" attempting to create a past participle or past tense form of "rebegin."  While "rebegin" exists, it typically uses the regular past tense "rebegan" and past participle "rebegun".  Therefore, a precise definition and usage examples are difficult to provide as it's considered grammatically incorrect by most style guides.|例句：The project rebegan after a brief hiatus. (While grammatically questionable, it conveys the meaning.) 项目在短暂中断后重新开始。|近义词：recommence, restart, resume|反义词：end, cease, finish|动词
