This word is not a standard entry in most dictionaries.  It's formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") and "ascertainments" (the act of finding something out for certain).  Therefore, it means things that haven't been ascertained or determined.  There is no standard grammatical usage section because the word itself is not common and its usage would follow standard noun usage rules.  There are no common phrases involving this word.  The provided example sentence demonstrates its typical use.
