词源:
The word "rencontre" comes from the Old French word "rencontrer," meaning "to meet," "to encounter," or "to run into."  This, in turn, is derived from the prefix "re-" (again) and the verb "contrer," meaning "to meet" or "to oppose."  The ultimate roots lie in the Latin word "contra," meaning "against" or "opposite."  This reflects the dual meaning of "rencontre," encompassing both chance meetings and conflicts.


用法说明:
Rencontre is primarily a noun. It's used to describe an unexpected or chance meeting, often with a sense of romantic intrigue or a significant, even fateful, encounter.  It can also refer to a conflict or clash, particularly a violent one.  The context heavily influences the meaning.

The word carries a slightly more formal and literary tone than simpler words like "meeting" or "encounter."
