USAGE->
This word is primarily used in academic contexts (anthropology, sociology) and doesn't have common usage in everyday language. Therefore, providing examples across various tenses isn't practical.  The word itself functions as an adjective describing a system, not a verb or noun that takes different tenses.


PHRASE->
