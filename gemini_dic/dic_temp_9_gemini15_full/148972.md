oviparity:/ˌoʊvɪˈpærəti/ | n. | 卵生；卵胎生 | The process of producing offspring through eggs that develop and hatch outside the mother's body.  Oviparity is a reproductive strategy employed by many animals, including birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, and insects.  The eggs may be laid in nests, buried in the ground, or simply left in the environment.  | Example: Most reptiles exhibit oviparity, laying their eggs on land or in water.  大多数爬行动物表现出卵生，将卵产在陆地或水中。 |近义词：egg-laying|反义词：viviparity (胎生)
