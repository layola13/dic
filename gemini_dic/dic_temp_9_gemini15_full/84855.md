词源:

The word "hangdog" originated in the 16th century.  Its etymology is somewhat uncertain, but the most likely explanation connects it to the practice of hanging dogs deemed to be stray or vicious.  The image of a hanged dog, its head drooping, became associated with dejection and shame.  The word evolved from this visual imagery to describe a person's demeanour.
