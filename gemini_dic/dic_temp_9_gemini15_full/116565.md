The word "matiness" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a complete etymology, usage, synonyms, or antonyms.  It might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of another word, perhaps "matronliness" (the quality of being like a matron), or a similar word.  More context is needed to determine the intended word.

2. **A newly coined word:** It could be a newly invented word, a slang term, or a neologism specific to a particular community or context. Without further information, its meaning and usage cannot be determined.

3. **A proper noun:** It might be a proper noun (like a person's name or a place name) that is not widely known.


To provide a complete analysis like the example, a valid English word is required.  Please provide a different word, or more context about where you encountered "matiness" so a more accurate response can be given.
