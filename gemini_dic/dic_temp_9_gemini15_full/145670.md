词源:  The word "overcontrolling" is a compound word formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the adjective "controlling" (meaning "exerting control").  "Controlling" itself derives from the verb "to control," ultimately from Old French *controlier (to check, verify), from Vulgar Latin *contrarotulare (to counter-roll), from Latin contra ("against") + rota ("wheel").
