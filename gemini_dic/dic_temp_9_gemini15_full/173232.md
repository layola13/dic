quasi-complex:/ˈkwɑːziˌkɒmplɛks/| adj.|拟复数的，准复数的 |  Describing a structure or system that possesses some but not all of the properties of a complex structure.  It often refers to mathematical structures that share similarities with complex numbers but lack certain key characteristics. For example, a quasi-complex structure on a manifold is a linear endomorphism that squares to -1, but doesn't necessarily satisfy all the conditions of a complex structure.|例句：The paper explores the properties of quasi-complex manifolds. 这篇论文探讨了拟复流形的性质。The proposed model is a quasi-complex system, exhibiting some but not all the features of a truly complex system.  提出的模型是一个拟复系统，表现出一些但并非所有真正复杂系统的特征。|近义词：pseudo-complex, almost complex |反义词：complex
