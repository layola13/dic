词源:
The word "outbluffing" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent than," "surpass") and the verb "bluffing" (meaning "to deceive by pretending").  "Bluffing" itself originates from the Dutch word "bluffen," meaning "to bluff, boast, or swagger."  The use of bluff in card games solidified its meaning in English.
