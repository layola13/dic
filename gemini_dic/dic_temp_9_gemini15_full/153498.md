词源:

The word "pensionability" is derived from the noun "pension" and the suffix "-ability."

* **Pension:**  Originates from the Latin word "pensio," meaning "payment," "weighing," or "paying out."  It evolved through Old French "pension" to its modern English form.

* **-ability:**  This suffix is an English derivational suffix indicating "the state or quality of being able," "capable of," or "fitness for."

因此，“pensionability” 的词源追溯到拉丁语，体现了“支付”和“资格”的含义结合。
