It likely intends to convey possession related to "caries" (itself a plural noun, though sometimes used as singular).  Let's analyze "caries" first and then discuss how the apostrophe-s might be misused:


**caries:** /ˈkæriːz/ | n. |龋齿（复数）；蛀牙（复数）|Dental caries, or tooth decay, is a process where the hard tissues of the teeth are progressively destroyed by bacterial acids.  Caries are caused by bacteria that feed on sugars in the mouth, producing acids that attack tooth enamel.  |近义词：tooth decay, dental cavities |反义词：healthy teeth

**Regarding "caries's":**

The apostrophe-s ('s) is typically used to show possession. Since "caries" is already a plural noun, adding 's is grammatically incorrect for standard possessive.  If one wanted to express possession related to caries, one might say:

* **The caries' location:** (Shows possession, slightly less common but acceptable)
* **The location of the caries:** (A more natural and grammatically correct alternative)


In short,  "caries's" is not a correct word. The intended meaning needs to be expressed using alternative phrasing.
