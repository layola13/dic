词源:
The word "moisturizing" is derived from the noun "moisture" and the suffix "-izing," which indicates the process of making or becoming something. "Moisture" ultimately comes from the Old French word "moiste," meaning "moist," which in turn has roots in the Latin word "mustus," meaning "fresh, new."  The suffix "-izing" is a common English suffix meaning "to make or become."
