词源:
The word "skank" itself has uncertain origins, but it's likely derived from a combination of slang terms associated with low social standing and unattractiveness, possibly with roots in African-American Vernacular English (AAVE).  The "-ier" suffix is a comparative adjective ending, meaning "more".
