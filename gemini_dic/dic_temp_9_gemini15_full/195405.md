词源:  The word "seminal" ultimately derives from the Latin word "semen," meaning "seed."  The original meaning related to the biological sense of "seed," referring to sperm or seminal fluid.  Over time, its meaning broadened metaphorically to describe things that are "seed-like" in their power to generate new ideas, movements, or developments.  This metaphorical extension is based on the idea that a seed contains the potential for future growth and development.
