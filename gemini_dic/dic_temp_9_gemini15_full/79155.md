词源:  From Middle English *glairy, from Old French glaire "white of egg," ultimately of Germanic origin (related to Old High German glaire "slime, mucus").  The sense evolution is from the shiny, viscous appearance of egg white to other shiny or sticky substances, and then to a metaphorical application to angry eyes.
