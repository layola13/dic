词源:
The word is formed by combining:

* **self-seeking:** This is a compound adjective meaning "motivated by self-interest."  It combines "self" (referring to oneself) and "seeking" (the act of searching for or pursuing).

* **-nesses:** This is a plural suffix added to nouns, particularly those ending in "-ness," to create a plural form emphasizing multiple instances or aspects of a quality.  "Ness" itself is a suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives (e.g., "goodness," "kindness").

Therefore, "self-seekingnesses" means multiple instances or aspects of self-seeking behavior.
