The word "cheraki" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage description cannot be provided.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?

2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name (person, place, or thing), a brand name, or a term specific to a certain field or community.  More context is needed.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a word used within a specific group, or slang not yet widely recognized.

4. **It's from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into English.  If you can provide the language of origin, it might be possible to provide a translation and explanation.
