词源:
The word "mistranslate" is a combination of the prefix "mis-" (meaning wrongly or badly) and the verb "translate".  It emerged naturally as a compound word from the existing vocabulary, reflecting the need for a term specifically indicating an inaccurate translation.  The roots trace back to the Latin word "translatus," the past participle of "transferre," meaning "to carry across."
