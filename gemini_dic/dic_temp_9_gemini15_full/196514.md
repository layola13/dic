The word "servilities" is derived from the Latin word "servilis," meaning "of or pertaining to a slave,"  which in turn comes from "servus," meaning "slave." The suffix "-ities" denotes the plural form and a state or quality.  Therefore, "servilities" literally means "the qualities or characteristics of a slave," extending to the behaviors and attitudes associated with slavish behavior.
