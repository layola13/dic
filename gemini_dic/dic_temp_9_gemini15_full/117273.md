词源:  The word derives from "mechanism," which comes from the Greek word "mēkhanē" (μηχανή), meaning "machine" or "contrivance," combined with the suffix "-ism," indicating a doctrine or system, and finally "-ally," an adverbial suffix.  Therefore, "mechanistically" literally means "in a manner relating to the principles of machines or mechanics."
