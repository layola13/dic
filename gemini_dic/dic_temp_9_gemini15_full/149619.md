词源:
The word "painstakingly" is derived from the adjective "painstaking," which itself combines "pain" and "taking."  Originally,  "painstaking" referred to something that caused pain or trouble, implying difficulty and effort. Over time, the meaning shifted to emphasize the positive aspect of diligent and careful work, even if it was laborious.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating manner or way.
