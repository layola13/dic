词源：

The word "conscienceless" is derived from the word "conscience," which comes from the Old French word "conscience," meaning "knowledge, awareness."  This in turn traces back to the Latin word "conscientia," a combination of "con-" (with, together) and "scientia" (knowledge).  The suffix "-less" indicates the absence of something, thus "conscienceless" means "without conscience."


用法说明:

conscienceless is primarily used as an adjective to describe a person, action, or organization that is devoid of moral principles or a sense of right and wrong. It implies a disregard for the feelings and well-being of others.  The word carries a strong negative connotation.
