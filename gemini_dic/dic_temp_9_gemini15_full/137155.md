词源:  The word is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "subtle."  "Subtle" itself comes from the Late Latin word *subtilis*, meaning "fine, thin, delicate," ultimately derived from the Latin *sub* ("under") and *texere* ("to weave").  Therefore, "nonsubtler" literally means "not fine, thin, or delicate" in its original sense, extending to the figurative meaning of lacking subtlety or refinement.
