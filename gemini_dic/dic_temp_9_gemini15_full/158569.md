pleurenchyma:/ˌplʊərˈɛŋkɪmə/| n. |薄壁组织|Parenchyma with thin-walled cells, typically found in soft plant tissues.  It is characterized by its relatively large, loosely packed cells with thin primary cell walls.  These cells are often involved in storage, photosynthesis, and secretion. |Example: The succulent leaves of many desert plants are packed with pleurenchyma to store water.  多肉植物的叶子中充满了薄壁组织以储存水分。|近义词：parenchyma (更广泛的术语)|反义词：sclerenchyma (厚壁组织)|名词
