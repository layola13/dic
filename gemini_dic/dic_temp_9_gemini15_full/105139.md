词源:The word "ketch" ultimately derives from the Middle Dutch word *kotse, meaning “small boat” or “ship”, possibly related to the Dutch word *kots, meaning "tub" or "vat", reflecting the shape of some early vessels.  The word entered English in the 17th century.  The evolution reflects the gradual development and refinement of the ketch design.
