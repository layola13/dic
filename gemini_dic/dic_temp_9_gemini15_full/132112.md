The word "noncriticizing" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" and the verb "criticizing".

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of".

* **criticizing**: The present participle of the verb "criticize", meaning to express disapproval of someone or something.  The verb "criticize" derives from the Late Middle English word "criticize", which in turn comes from the Late Latin "criticare", meaning "to judge" or "to criticize".  This ultimately traces back to the Greek "kritikos" (κριτικός), meaning "able to judge" or "critical," from "krinein" (κρίνειν), meaning "to separate" or "to decide."

Therefore, "noncriticizing" means not engaging in the act of criticizing or judging.
