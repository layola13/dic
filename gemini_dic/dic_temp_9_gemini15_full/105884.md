The word "kitte" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word, like "kitten," "kit," or another word entirely.  Please double-check your spelling.
* **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or place name not widely known.
* **It's slang or dialectal:** The word might be used informally in a specific region or community.
* **It's a newly coined word:**  While unlikely, it's possible the word is very new and hasn't made it into dictionaries yet.


If you can provide more context (a sentence where you saw the word, the source, etc.), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
