词源:

The word "overtimid" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the adjective "timid" (meaning "showing a lack of courage and confidence; easily frightened").  Therefore, it literally means "excessively timid."  The root of "timid" traces back to Latin "timidus," meaning "fearful."
