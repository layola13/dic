词源:  The word "incompliant" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "compliant," which itself derives from the verb "comply," meaning "to act in accordance with a wish or command."  The ultimate root lies in the Latin word "complere," meaning "to fill up" or "to complete."  The sense of fulfilling a requirement or obligation evolved from this original meaning.
