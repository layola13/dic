quasi-basically:/ˈkwɑːzaɪ ˈbeɪsɪkli/ | adv. | 基本上，大致上，差不多 |  This word combines "quasi," meaning "seemingly" or "to a certain extent," with "basically," meaning "fundamentally" or "in essence."

The nuance is that the statement is not entirely accurate but close enough for practical purposes. | 例句：Quasi-basically, the project is finished, but there are a few minor details left to address.  = 大致上，项目完成了，但还有一些小细节需要处理。


例句：He quasi-basically agreed to the proposal, but he wanted some minor changes. = 他基本上同意了这个提议，但他想要做一些小的改动。
