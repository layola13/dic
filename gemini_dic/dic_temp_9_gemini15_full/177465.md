词源:
The word "rebel" comes from the Old French word "rebell," meaning "to revolt," which in turn derives from the Latin word "rebellis," meaning "rebellious" or "revolting."  The Latin word is formed from the prefix "re-" (again) and "bellum" (war), literally meaning "to wage war again" or "to renew war."
