cravingnesses:/ˈkreɪvɪŋnəsɪz/ | n. |渴望，强烈欲望的复数形式 |The word "cravingnesses" is the plural form of "cravingness," which itself is not a standard English word.  It attempts to create a noun form emphasizing the intensity or multiplicity of cravings.  However, it's considered unconventional and unnatural. Using "cravings" or "intense cravings" would be more appropriate. |例句：His cravingnesses for sweets and chocolate were overwhelming. (This sentence is grammatically correct but stylistically awkward.  It would be better to say: His intense cravings for sweets and chocolate were overwhelming.) |近义词：longings, desires, yearnings |反义词：disinterest, apathy
