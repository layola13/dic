The word "clayes" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Please double-check your spelling.
* **A proper noun:**  It might be a place name, a surname, or a brand name.
* **A dialectal word or archaic word:** It might be used in a specific region or have been used historically, but is no longer common.
* **A neologism (newly coined word):** It might be a very recently invented word not yet widely recognized.

Without more context or information, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  If you can provide additional context (sentence where you encountered it, source, etc.), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
