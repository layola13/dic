redifferentiating: /ˌriːdɪfərənˈʃeɪtɪŋ/ | v. | 再分化；重新分化 | The process by which a cell or tissue changes its specialized function to a less specialized state, often as part of a developmental or regenerative process.  This is an ongoing action, represented by the -ing form. | Example:  The researchers observed the stem cells redifferentiating into various cell types.  研究人员观察到干细胞重新分化为各种细胞类型。


The cells are currently redifferentiating into muscle tissue. 这些细胞目前正在重新分化成肌肉组织。


近义词: differentiating again,  re-specializing (in a less specific sense) | 反义词:  terminal differentiation (the opposite process of becoming fully specialized and losing the ability to redifferentiate) | 词性: Verb (present participle)
