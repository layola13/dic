词源:

The word "pinafore" originates from the phrase "pin-before," referring to the fact that it was pinned before or in front of other clothing.  The "pin" element points to the use of pins to fasten the garment, while "before" indicates its position over other clothes.  Over time, the spelling evolved into "pinafore".
