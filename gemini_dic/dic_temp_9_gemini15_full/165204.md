The word "preinherits" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need to understand the intended meaning or context where you encountered this word.  Is it a technical term from a specific field?  Did you perhaps misspell a similar word?

If you can provide more context, I can try to offer suggestions for the correct word or a possible interpretation of the intended meaning.
