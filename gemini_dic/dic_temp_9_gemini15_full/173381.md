WORD ORIGIN->
The word is a combination of "quasi," meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent," and "dramatically," meaning "in a way that is exciting and impressive, often involving conflict or strong emotions."  The prefix "quasi-" comes from Latin, indicating something that resembles or is similar to something else but not exactly the same.

USAGE->  (Since "quasi-dramatically" is an adverb,  it modifies verbs and describes how an action is performed.  There's no conjugation as with verbs.)

PHRASE-> (Phrases using "quasi-dramatically" are context-dependent and less frequent than single-word usage.  Examples would be highly situational. )  There aren't standard set phrases with this adverb.
