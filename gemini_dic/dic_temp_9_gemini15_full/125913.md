词源:

The word "museo" is borrowed directly from the Italian word "museo," which in turn comes from the Latin word "museum."  The Latin "museum" ultimately derives from the Greek word "mouseion" (μουσεῖον), which originally referred to a temple dedicated to the Muses, the goddesses of arts and sciences in Greek mythology.  Over time, the meaning shifted to denote a place of learning and study, eventually evolving into the modern meaning of a museum.
