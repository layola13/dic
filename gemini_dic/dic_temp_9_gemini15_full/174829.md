The word "rache" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "reach," "Rachel," or another word entirely?

2. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name (perhaps a surname or a less common given name) or a place name not widely known.

3. **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language, and without knowing the origin language, it's impossible to provide a definition.

4. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word or a slang term not yet widely adopted.

To help me provide the requested information, please clarify the spelling or provide more context about where you encountered this word.
