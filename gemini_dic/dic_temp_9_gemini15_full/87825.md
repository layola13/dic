词源:
The word "hicks" as a term for a rural person likely originated in the American South and Midwest during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Its precise etymology is uncertain, but it's probably a pejorative term rooted in perceptions of rural people as unsophisticated or backward compared to urban dwellers. The term "hiccup" is unrelated but shares a similar sound.
