This word is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a nonce word, meaning it was coined for a specific occasion and isn't in common usage.  It's formed by adding '-ness' (a suffix that creates nouns of quality or state) to 'pronounced,' which itself is the adjectival form of the verb 'pronounce.'  Therefore, 'pronouncedness' attempts to convey the quality or state of being pronounced, or the degree to which something is pronounced.


Because it's a nonce word, providing grammatical examples in various tenses, moods, or voices is meaningless as it wouldn't be used in those contexts.  Standard grammatical structures would use "pronunciation" or adjectives like "pronounced" instead.  Likewise, common phrases using this word are nonexistent.
