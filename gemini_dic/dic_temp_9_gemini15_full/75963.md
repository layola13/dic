funkily:/ˈfʌŋkɪli/| adv.|时髦地；有节奏地；奇异地 |In a funky manner; stylishly and unconventionally.  The adverb form of "funky". It describes something done in a way that is stylish, unconventional, and often rhythmically exciting.|例句：She danced funkily to the music. 她随着音乐时髦地跳舞。

词源:  The word derives from "funky," which originally referred to a musty or unpleasant smell.  However, its meaning evolved in the mid-20th century, particularly within African American Vernacular English (AAVE), to describe a style of music (funk) and, subsequently, a general aesthetic of coolness, unconventionality, and rhythmic energy. The "-ily" suffix transforms the adjective "funky" into an adverb, modifying verbs and describing how an action is performed.
