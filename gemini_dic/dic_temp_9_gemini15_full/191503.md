WORD ORIGIN->
The word "schmaltz" itself is of Yiddish origin, ultimately deriving from the German word "Schmalz," meaning "rendered fat" or "lard."  In Yiddish, "schmaltz" came to mean something overly sentimental or excessively emotional, possibly due to the rich, heavy texture of the fat being associated with richness and overindulgence in sentiment.  "Schmaltzier" is simply the comparative form of "schmaltz," indicating a greater degree of sentimentality or emotionalism.
