词源:
The word "sandpapering" is derived from the noun "sandpaper" and the suffix "-ing," which indicates the act of doing something.  "Sandpaper" itself is a compound word combining "sand" (the abrasive material) and "paper" (the material it's attached to).  The etymology traces back to the Old English words for "sand" and "paper," reflecting the long history of using this material for smoothing surfaces.
