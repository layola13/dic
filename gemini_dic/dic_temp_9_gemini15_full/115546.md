mapper:/ˈmæpər/ | n. |映射器，映射程序|A mapper is a component or function that transforms data from one format or structure into another.  In computer science, mappers are commonly used in parallel processing frameworks like MapReduce to process large datasets.  They typically take input data, apply a transformation function, and produce output data.|Example: In a MapReduce job, the mapper reads input data, processes it according to a defined function, and writes the intermediate results to a key-value store.|近义词：transformer, translator |反义词：reducer (in the context of MapReduce)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The mapper processes the data efficiently. = 映射器高效地处理数据。
This mapper converts JSON to XML. = 这个映射器将 JSON 转换为 XML。


一般过去时:
The mapper processed the entire dataset overnight. = 映射器一夜之间处理了整个数据集。
The old mapper was slower than the new one. = 旧的映射器比新的慢。


现在完成时:
The mapper has already finished processing the file. = 映射器已经完成了文件的处理。
The system has used this mapper successfully for years. = 系统多年来一直成功地使用这个映射器。


过去完成时:
The mapper had completed its task before the reducer started. = 在化简器开始之前，映射器已经完成了它的任务。
The program had used a different mapper in the previous version. = 该程序在之前的版本中使用了不同的映射器。


将来时:
The mapper will process the data in parallel. = 映射器将并行处理数据。
We will implement a new mapper for improved performance. = 我们将实现一个新的映射器以提高性能。


虚拟语气:
If the mapper were faster, the process would be quicker. = 如果映射器更快，过程就会更快。
I wish the mapper had handled errors more gracefully. = 我希望映射器能更优雅地处理错误。


被动语态:
The data is processed by the mapper. = 数据由映射器处理。
The results are written to disk by the mapper. = 结果由映射器写入磁盘。


疑问句:
What type of mapper are you using? = 你正在使用什么类型的映射器？
Does the mapper handle null values correctly? = 映射器是否正确处理空值？


否定句:
The mapper did not find any matching records. = 映射器没有找到任何匹配的记录。
The mapper doesn't support this data format. = 映射器不支持此数据格式。


PHRASE->
Mapper function = 映射函数
Mapper class = 映射器类
Mapper output = 映射器输出
Hadoop mapper = Hadoop 映射器
Custom mapper = 自定义映射器


词源:
The word "mapper" derives from the verb "map," meaning to represent something in a particular way.  The "-er" suffix indicates an agent or doer of the action.  Therefore, a "mapper" is something that performs the action of mapping.  The specific usage in computer science emerged with the development of parallel processing frameworks like MapReduce.
