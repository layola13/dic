词源:
The word "configuration" comes from the late Middle English word "configuracioun," derived from the Old French "configuracion" and ultimately from the Latin "configuratio," meaning "a shaping, forming."  The Latin word is formed from "configurare," meaning "to configure," which combines "con-" (together) and "figurare" (to shape).
