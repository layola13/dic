dirigibility:/ˌdɪrɪdʒəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可操纵性；飞艇的操纵性 | The ability of an airship to be steered.  It refers to the controllability and maneuverability of an airship or other lighter-than-air craft.  | Example: The early dirigibles had limited dirigibility, making long-distance flights challenging. 早期飞艇的可操纵性有限，使得长途飞行具有挑战性。 | 近义词：steerability, maneuverability | 反义词：unsteerability, unmaneuverability

词源:
The word "dirigibility" is derived from the French word "dirigeable," which itself comes from the verb "diriger," meaning "to direct" or "to steer."  The suffix "-ibility" indicates the capacity or capability of being directed or steered.  Therefore, "dirigibility" literally means "the ability to be steered."
