enclitics:/ɪnˈklɪtɪks/ | n. | 附着词 | 附着词是依附于另一个词的词素，通常是语气词或助词，其重音落在主要词上。它们通常是功能词，例如代词、助动词、连接词等等，它们依靠主要词来获得自身的意义和发音。  | Example:  "Doesn't" is an enclitic; the stress falls on "does," and "-n't" is a shortened form of "not."  "Doesn't he know?"  他不明白吗？ | 近义词：clitic (更广泛的术语，包含前缀词) | 反义词：N/A


词源:  The word "enclitic" comes from the Greek words *en-* (meaning "in" or "on") and *klinein* (meaning "to lean" or "to incline").  This reflects the grammatical function of enclitics as words that "lean on" or attach themselves to other words.


用法说明:

Enclitics are a type of clitic, which is a word that has lost its independence and is phonologically bound to another word.  Unlike prefixes or suffixes, which are bound morphemes attached to the beginning or end of a word respectively, clitics attach to a host word, but they are themselves independent words with a separate meaning.  Enclitics specifically attach to the end of a host word.


例句:

* **"I'm"**: This is a contraction of "I am," where "am" is an enclitic attached to "I". 我是
* **"He's"**:  This is a contraction of "He is," where "is" is an enclitic attached to "He". 他是
* **"Let's"**: This is a contraction of "Let us," where "us" is an enclitic attached to "Let". 让我们
* **"Won't"**: This is a contraction of "will not," where "not" is an enclitic attached to "will". 不会
* **"Can't"**: This is a contraction of "can not," where "not" is an enclitic attached to "can". 不能


需要注意的是，英语中的enclitics通常是通过缩写或连读来实现的，在书写中可能并不总是显而易见。  对enclitics的识别通常需要考虑语音和语义的结合。


由于enclitics本身并非独立的语法类别，所以不适用一般现在时、过去时等语法范畴的例句。  其用法完全依赖于其所依附的词语。
