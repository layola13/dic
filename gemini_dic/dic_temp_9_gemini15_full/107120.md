ladyboy: /ˈleɪdiˌbɔɪ/ | n. |变性人（男扮女装者）| A ladyboy is a term, often considered offensive, for a transgender woman, specifically a male-to-female transgender person.  The term is commonly used in Southeast Asia, particularly Thailand.  It combines "lady" and "boy," highlighting the person's presentation as a woman while acknowledging their biological sex assigned at birth.  Because of its potentially offensive and reductive nature, its use is generally discouraged.  | Example:  The cabaret show featured several talented ladyboys.  歌舞表演有几个才华横溢的变性人。|近义词: transgender woman, trans woman (preferred terms)|反义词:  None directly applicable, but terms like "cisgender man" describe the opposite gender identity and biological sex.
