/rʌf ændˈrediːnɪsɪz/ | n. |粗鲁和准备不足 |The term "rough-and-readinesses" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a contrived plural noun formed by combining "rough-and-ready" (an adjective meaning unprepared but effective) with "-nesses" (a suffix indicating a plural state or quality).  Therefore, a direct translation and detailed grammatical analysis are difficult as it lacks established usage.  It suggests a state of being simultaneously unprepared and somewhat aggressive or careless. | Example: The general's rough-and-readinesses were surprising, yet somehow they led to victory.  将军的粗鲁和准备不足令人惊讶，但不知何故，它们却导致了胜利。 | 近义词: (Depending on context) unpreparednesses,  casualness, recklessness, improvisations | 反义词: (Depending on context) meticulousness, preparedness, caution, carefulness |  n.
