The word "inherse" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or archaic vocabulary.  If you could provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer some suggestions.
