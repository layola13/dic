remanency:/ˈrɛmənənsi/| n. |剩余磁性；剩余效应；残留性|The ability of a material to retain magnetization after the magnetizing field has been removed.  It's a measure of how well a material "remembers" its magnetic state.  This property is crucial in many applications, including data storage and permanent magnets.|例句：The remanency of the hard drive is crucial for data retention.  这硬盘的剩余磁性对数据保留至关重要。

The high remanency of this alloy makes it ideal for permanent magnets.  这种合金的高剩余磁性使其成为永磁体的理想选择。|近义词：residual magnetism, retentivity|反义词：demagnetization|名词
