词源:

The word "incommensurability" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the word "commensurable" (meaning "capable of being measured by a common standard"), and the suffix "-ility" (meaning "the state or quality of").  "Commensurable" itself comes from the Latin "commensurābilis," from "com-" (together) + "mensūra" (measure).  Therefore, incommensurability literally means "the state of not being measurable by a common standard."
