USAGE->
一般现在时:
The bacteria are nonphotobiotic. = 这些细菌是非光合生物的。
This organism is nonphotobiotic. =  这种生物是非光合作用的。


一般过去时:
The researchers found the species to be nonphotobiotic. = 研究人员发现该物种是非光合生物的。
Scientists determined that the organism was nonphotobiotic. = 科学家确定该生物是非光合作用的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered many nonphotobiotic species in the deep ocean. = 科学家们已经在深海中发现了许多非光合生物物种。
Researchers have confirmed that this organism is nonphotobiotic. = 研究人员已经证实这种生物是非光合作用的。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, they had assumed the organism was photobiotic. = 在发现之前，他们曾假设该生物是光合生物。
It had been previously believed that this species was photobiotic, but it proved to be nonphotobiotic. =  之前人们认为该物种是光合生物，但事实证明它是非光合生物的。


将来时:
Future research will likely identify more nonphotobiotic organisms. = 未来的研究可能会鉴定出更多非光合生物。
We will confirm if the sample is indeed nonphotobiotic. = 我们将确认样本是否确实是 非光合生物的。


虚拟语气:
If the organism were photobiotic, it would have different characteristics. = 如果该生物是光合生物，它将具有不同的特征。
I wish we knew whether this newly discovered species is photobiotic or nonphotobiotic. =我希望我们知道这个新发现的物种是光合生物还是非光合生物。


被动语态:
Many nonphotobiotic organisms are found in extreme environments. = 许多非光合生物存在于极端环境中。
The sample was determined to be nonphotobiotic after thorough testing. = 样本经过彻底测试后被确定为非光合生物的。


疑问句:
Is this species photobiotic or nonphotobiotic? = 这种物种是光合生物还是非光合生物？
Are all organisms living in the deep sea nonphotobiotic? = 深海中所有生物都是非光合生物吗？


否定句:
This organism is not nonphotobiotic; it's photobiotic. = 这种生物不是非光合生物；它是光合生物。
The bacteria are not nonphotobiotic; they are capable of photosynthesis. = 这些细菌不是非光合生物；它们能够进行光合作用。
