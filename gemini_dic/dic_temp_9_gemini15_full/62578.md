词源:
enervation comes from the Late Latin word *enervatio*, meaning "weakening,"  derived from the Latin verb *enervāre*, meaning "to weaken," which itself is formed from *e-*, a negative prefix, and *nervus*, meaning "sinew, nerve, strength."  Therefore,  the word literally means "to remove the strength or nerve from."
