词源:
The word "ghettoed" is derived from "ghetto," which originates from the Italian word "ghetto," meaning "foundry" or "melting pot."  In the late Middle Ages, it was used to refer to the designated areas in Venice where Jews were required to live.  Over time, the term acquired negative connotations, associating it with poverty, segregation, and social isolation.  The verb form "ghettoed" reflects this evolution, describing the process of being confined or restricted to such a marginalized area or social standing.
