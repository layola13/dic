词源:

The word "counterfeiting" comes from the Old French word "contrefaire," meaning "to make against," "to imitate," or "to forge."  The prefix "counter-" indicates opposition or imitation. The "-ing" suffix indicates the act or process of doing something.  Therefore, the word literally means the act of making something in opposition to the original, or making a false imitation.
