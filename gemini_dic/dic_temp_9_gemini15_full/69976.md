词源:
The word "festoony" is derived from "festoon," which comes from the Old French *feston, ultimately from Latin *festum ("feast").  The suffix "-y" adds an adjectival quality, meaning "full of" or "characterized by."  Therefore, "festoony" literally means "full of festoons" or "having the characteristics of festoons."
