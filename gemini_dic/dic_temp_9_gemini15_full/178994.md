The word "redefects" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need to consider possible interpretations:

**Possibility 1: Misspelling of "re-defects"**

This suggests a combination of "re-" (again, anew) and "defects."  In this case:

* **Pronunciation:** /ˌriːˈdɛfɛkts/ (This is a phonetic approximation based on the constituent parts)
* **Word Attributes:** Noun (plural)
* **Chinese Translation:** 重新出现的缺陷; 再次发生的缺陷
* **English Analysis:**  This would refer to defects that reappear or occur again after an initial attempt at repair or correction.
* **Example:** "Despite the repairs, the product still showed re-defects within a month."  = “尽管进行了维修，该产品在一个月内仍然出现了再次发生的缺陷。”

* **Near Synonyms:** Recurring flaws, repeated imperfections, renewed defects
* **Antonyms:** Perfections, faultlessness
* **Word Class:** Noun


**Possibility 2: Misspelling intending a different word entirely**

Without further context, it's impossible to definitively determine the intended word.  It could be a misspelling of a technical term or a word from a specific field.


**Note:** Because "redefects" is not a standard word, usage examples in various tenses, passive voice, etc., are not applicable.  Similarly, common phrases using this non-existent word cannot be provided.  Only if a correct spelling or intended meaning is given can a complete analysis be offered.
