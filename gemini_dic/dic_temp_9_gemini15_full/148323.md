oversorrowfulnesses:/ˌoʊvərˈsɔːroʊfʊlnəsɪz/| n. |过度悲伤，极度忧愁|The word "oversorrowfulnesses" is a rarely used, and arguably awkward, formation. It implies multiple instances of excessive sadness or grief.  It's essentially the plural of "oversorrowfulness," which itself is an uncommon word.  The word is formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively) to "sorrowfulness," and then adding "-es" to create the plural.  The word is grammatically correct but stylistically questionable due to its length and unusual nature. A simpler, more natural way to express the idea would be "excessive sorrows" or "many instances of deep sadness." |例句：The over sorrowfulnesses of the widow were palpable, affecting everyone around her.  寡妇极度的悲伤是显而易见的，影响了周围的每个人。  The multiple over sorrowfulnesses experienced by the family after the accident were difficult to bear. 事故后家庭经历的多次过度悲伤难以承受。 |近义词：excessive griefs, profound sorrows, intense sadness, multiple melancholies |反义词：unbounded joy, extreme happiness, utter bliss |名词
