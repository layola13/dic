词源:

The word "seedy" ultimately derives from the word "seed," referring to the seeds of plants.  Over time, its meaning shifted to suggest something deteriorated or decayed, like seeds that have gone bad. The association with moral decay and disrepute likely followed this, linking the physical decay to a decline in standards.
