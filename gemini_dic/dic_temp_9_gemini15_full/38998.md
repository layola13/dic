The word "confirmednesses" is not a standard or commonly used word in English.  It's a rather artificial formation, created by adding the suffix "-nesses" (indicating a plural of qualities or states) to the already existing noun "confirmedness," which itself is also infrequent.  While grammatically possible, it sounds awkward and unnatural in most contexts.

**Word Formation:**

* **Confirm:** (verb)  To state or show that something is definitely true or correct.
* **Confirmed:** (adjective)  Having been proved or shown to be true.
* **Confirmedness:** (noun) The state of being confirmed or certain; the degree of certainty.  This word is uncommon.
* **Confirmednesses:** (noun, plural) Multiple instances or degrees of confirmedness. This word is extremely rare and unnatural.


**Usage (Hypothetical, given the unnatural nature of the word):**

Because "confirmednesses" is not a standard word, providing typical usage examples in various tenses is not meaningful.  Its usage would be highly contextual and likely found only in very specific, perhaps technical or highly formal, writings where extreme emphasis on multiple levels of certainty is needed.  Even then, a more natural alternative would likely be preferable.

For example, one might *hypothetically* use it in a sentence like:

"The multiple lines of evidence presented yielded several distinct confirmednesses, each supporting the overall conclusion."  (This sentence is still awkward, and better phrasing exists.)

**Alternatives:**

Instead of "confirmednesses," one could use clearer and more natural alternatives, depending on the context:

* **Certainties:**  This is the most direct and common replacement.
* **Verifications:** Emphasizes the process of proving something true.
* **Affirmations:** Highlights the positive assertion of truth.
* **Confirmations:**  Simple plural of "confirmation," which is much more common.
* **Levels of certainty:** This phrase more clearly expresses the idea of multiple degrees of confirmation.



**In summary:**  While "confirmednesses" is grammatically understandable, it is not a word found in standard English usage. Using more common synonyms will always be preferred.
