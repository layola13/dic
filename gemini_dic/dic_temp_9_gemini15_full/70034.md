词源:
The word "fetlock" ultimately derives from the Old English words "fēt" (foot) and "lōc" (lock).  The original meaning referred to the "lock" or "fastening" of the foot, referring to the way the joint secures the lower leg to the foot.  Over time, the meaning has narrowed to specifically refer to the joint itself.
