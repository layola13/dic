词源:
The word "mesmerized" comes from the name of Franz Mesmer (1734-1815), an Austrian physician who developed a system of treatment known as "mesmerism," which involved inducing a trance-like state in patients through suggestion and manipulation.  Though his methods are now considered pseudoscience, the term "mesmerize" has survived to describe the state of being captivated or hypnotized.
