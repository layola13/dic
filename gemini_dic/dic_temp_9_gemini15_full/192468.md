词源:
The word "scrummage" originates from the earlier word "scrum," which itself likely derives from the Scottish word "scrummie," meaning a contest or scramble, possibly from a root related to "scramble" and suggesting a chaotic, disorderly situation.  The "-age" suffix adds the sense of an action or process.
