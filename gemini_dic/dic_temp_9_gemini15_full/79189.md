词源：

The word "glamorous" evolved from "glamour," which itself has a complex etymology.  "Glamour" originally meant "magic spell" or "enchantment," deriving ultimately from the Old Norse word "glamr," meaning "magic, enchantment." Over time, its meaning shifted to describe an alluring or captivating quality, and "glamorous" emerged as its adjectival form, reflecting this evolved sense of attractiveness and allure.
