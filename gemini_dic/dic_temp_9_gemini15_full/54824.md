dispersibility: /ˌdɪspɜːrsəˈbɪləti/ | n. |分散性，分散能力|The ability of a substance to be dispersed or spread out in a medium.  This refers to how easily a material can be distributed or spread throughout another substance, often a liquid or gas.  The term is commonly used in fields like materials science, pharmacy, and food science. |例句：The dispersibility of the pigment in the paint determined the final color and texture. 颜料在油漆中的分散性决定了最终的颜色和质地。

The high dispersibility of the powder made it easy to mix into the solution.  这种粉末的高分散性使其易于混合到溶液中。|近义词：dispersiveness, spreadability |反义词：agglomeration, clumping

词源:

The word "dispersibility" is derived from the verb "disperse" and the suffix "-ibility," which indicates capacity or capability.  "Disperse" itself comes from the Latin word "dispersus," the past participle of "dispergere," meaning "to scatter" or "to spread."  The prefix "dis-" indicates separation or scattering, while the root "-pers-" is related to the idea of spreading or scattering.
