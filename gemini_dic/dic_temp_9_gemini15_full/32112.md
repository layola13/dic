词源:
The word "chestnutting" is a relatively recent coinage, derived directly from the noun "chestnut" and the suffix "-ing," which forms gerunds and present participles.  It's a straightforward descriptive word reflecting the action of gathering chestnuts.  The word's lack of a long history in dictionaries reflects its informal nature; it's more commonly understood through its context than found in formal writing.
