词源:
The term "knife-edge" is a compound of "knife" and "edge."  "Knife" comes from Old English *cnif, ultimately of Germanic origin. "Edge" comes from Old English ecg, also of Germanic origin. The figurative use, implying a precarious situation, developed from the literal sharpness and thinness of a knife's edge.
