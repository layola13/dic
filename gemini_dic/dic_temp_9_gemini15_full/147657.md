The word is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively"), the noun "popularity" (meaning the state of being liked, admired, or enjoyed by many people), and the suffix "-ities" (a pluralizing suffix used with nouns ending in "-ity").  Therefore, it literally means "too many popular things" or "excessive instances of popularity."
