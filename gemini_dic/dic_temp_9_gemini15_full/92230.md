/ˌhaɪpərˈtɒrɪdnɪsɪz/ | n. |极度炎热的状态（复数）|The word "hypertorridnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a contrived formation, combining "hyper" (excessively), "torrid" (extremely hot), and the plural suffix "-nesses".  It attempts to describe multiple instances or aspects of extreme heat. There is no established usage or definition.  It might be used in creative writing to emphasize the intensity of heat in a specific context, but it would likely be considered unusual or overly verbose.  |例句：The novel depicted the hypertorridnesses of the desert, each day bringing a new level of unbearable heat.  小说描绘了沙漠极度炎热的状态，每天都带来难以忍受的高温。The explorer documented various hypertorridnesses encountered during his expedition across the Sahara. 探险家记录了他穿越撒哈拉沙漠时遇到的各种极度炎热的状态。|近义词: extreme heats, intense heats, scorching temperatures (these are more common and natural)|反义词:  extreme colds, frigid temperatures|名词
