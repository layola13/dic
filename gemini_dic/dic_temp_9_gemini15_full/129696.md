词源:  The word "non-divisible" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "divisible," which derives from the verb "divide."  "Divide" ultimately comes from the Latin verb *dividere*, meaning "to divide, separate, or distribute."  Thus, "non-divisible" literally means "not capable of being divided."
