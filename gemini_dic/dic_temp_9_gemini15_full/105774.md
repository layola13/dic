词源:
The word "kirmess" is derived from the Middle Dutch word "kermesse," which in turn originates from the Middle Low German word "kermesse."  These words ultimately trace back to the Old French "qu'a messe," meaning "what (is) at Mass," referring to the festivities that often took place after church services.
