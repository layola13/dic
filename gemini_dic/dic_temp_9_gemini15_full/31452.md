词源:

The word "charlatanic" is derived from "charlatan," which ultimately comes from the Italian word "ciarlatano," meaning "a quack." This term, in turn, may be related to "ciarlare," meaning "to chatter" or "to babble." The implication is that charlatans use loud, empty talk to deceive their audience.  The suffix "-ic" transforms the noun "charlatan" into an adjective, describing something as characteristic of a charlatan.
