词源:  The word is a compound of "cheap" and "-skated," where "-skated" acts as a suffix intensifying the meaning of "cheap."  It suggests an excessive and almost obsessive focus on saving money, often to the point of being unpleasant or socially unacceptable.  The suffix "-skated" likely emerged through a process of informal word formation, perhaps mimicking the repetitive or obsessive nature of someone overly focused on saving money.
