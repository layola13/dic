词源:

The word "discipleship" is derived from the noun "disciple," which comes from the Old French word "disciple," ultimately from the Latin word "discipulus," meaning "learner" or "pupil."  The suffix "-ship" denotes a state, condition, or quality.  Therefore, "discipleship" signifies the state or condition of being a disciple.
