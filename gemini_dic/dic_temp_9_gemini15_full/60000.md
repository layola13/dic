词源:

The word "editorialize" comes from "editorial," which itself is derived from "editor," ultimately from Latin "editor," meaning "publisher" or "one who edits."  The suffix "-ize" indicates "to make or become."  Therefore, "editorialize" means "to make something like an editorial" or "to express opinions in the manner of an editorial."
