/piːˈdiː/ | n. |  概率密度；概率分布 | Probability density; the probability of a random variable falling within a particular range of values.  It's a function that describes the relative likelihood of a continuous random variable taking on a given value. | The PD of the normal distribution is bell-shaped.  正态分布的概率密度呈钟形。| probability distribution, density function |  N/A | noun


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The PD of this data set is normally distributed. = 这个数据集的概率密度服从正态分布。
We calculate the PD to understand the likelihood of different outcomes. = 我们计算概率密度来了解不同结果的可能性。

一般过去时:
The researcher analyzed the PD of the experimental results. = 研究人员分析了实验结果的概率密度。
They found that the PD was skewed to the right. = 他们发现概率密度向右倾斜。

现在完成时:
Scientists have determined the PD for various natural phenomena. = 科学家已经确定了各种自然现象的概率密度。
We have observed that the PD changes over time. = 我们观察到概率密度随时间变化。

过去完成时:
Before the analysis, they had estimated the PD using a different method. = 在分析之前，他们使用不同的方法估计了概率密度。
The team had already calculated the PD before the presentation. = 团队在演示之前就已经计算出了概率密度。

将来时:
We will model the PD to predict future trends. = 我们将对概率密度进行建模以预测未来的趋势。
They will analyze the PD to determine the risk involved. = 他们将分析概率密度以确定所涉及的风险。

虚拟语气:
If the PD were different, the results would be different. = 如果概率密度不同，结果也会不同。
I wish the PD were more clearly defined. = 我希望概率密度能更清晰地定义。

被动语态:
The PD was calculated using a sophisticated algorithm. = 概率密度是使用复杂的算法计算出来的。
The PD is being analyzed by the statistical team. = 概率密度正在由统计团队分析。

疑问句:
What is the PD of this random variable? = 这个随机变量的概率密度是多少？
How is the PD affected by the change in parameters? = 参数变化如何影响概率密度？

否定句:
The PD is not normally distributed. = 概率密度不服从正态分布。
They did not accurately estimate the PD. = 他们没有准确地估计概率密度。
