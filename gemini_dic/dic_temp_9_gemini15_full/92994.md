词源:
The word "idiomaticnesses" is derived from "idiomatic," which comes from "idiom."  "Idiom" ultimately comes from the Greek word "ἰδίωμα" (ídīōma), meaning "private property, peculiar characteristic, expression,"  reflecting the unique and often non-literal nature of idioms. The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, indicating the quality or state of being idiomatic.
