The word "drecche" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries or etymological resources. It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Providing more context (where you encountered this word) would help determine the intended word.

2. **It's a dialect word or slang:** It might be a regionalism or slang term not widely known.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **It's a word from another language:**  It could be a word borrowed from another language.  Specifying the language would be helpful.

4. **It's a neologism or invented word:**  Someone might have created this word.
