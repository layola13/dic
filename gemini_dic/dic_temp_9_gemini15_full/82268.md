词源:The word "groundling" originates from the Old English word "grund," meaning "ground" or "earth."  The suffix "-ling" is a diminutive suffix, often indicating a small or insignificant person or thing. Thus, a "groundling" originally referred to someone who sat on the ground, typically in a theatre before the introduction of seating. Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass anyone of low social standing.
