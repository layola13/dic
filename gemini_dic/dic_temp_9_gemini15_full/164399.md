词源:
The word "preenacting" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the verb "enacting" (meaning "to perform or represent").  Therefore, it literally means "performing or representing beforehand."  The root is the verb "act" and the process of adding prefixes and suffixes to modify its meaning.
