USAGE->
This word is a possessive form and doesn't have verb conjugations like the example word "what".  It functions grammatically as a noun modifying another noun.  There are no tenses or moods applicable.


PHRASE->
The word "firmness's" is rarely used in phrases on its own. It's typically part of a larger phrase describing a specific kind of firmness.  Examples would be constructed around a noun that the 's indicates possession of. For example:


"the firmness's impact":  坚定性的影响
"the firmness's expression": 坚定性的表达
"the firmness's degree": 坚定性的程度
"the firmness's nature": 坚定性的本质
"the project's firmness": 项目的坚定性


  Note that these are examples of phrases *using* "firmness's", not phrases *meaning* "firmness's."  Because it's a possessive form, it doesn't have independent idiomatic phrases like the example word "what".
