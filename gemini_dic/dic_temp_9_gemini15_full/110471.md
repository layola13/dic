词源:
The word is derived from "Lilliputian," an adjective referring to the inhabitants of Lilliput, the fictional island in Jonathan Swift's *Gulliver's Travels*, characterized by their extremely small size.  The suffix "-ize" is added to create a verb meaning "to make like a Lilliputian" or "to make small or insignificant."
