词源:

The word "entanglement" derives from the verb "entangle," which is formed from the Old English prefix "en-" (meaning "in" or "into") and the Old French word "tangler" (meaning "to catch, to snare").  The suffix "-ment" is a noun-forming suffix indicating the state or result of an action.  Therefore, "entanglement" literally signifies the state of being caught or snared in something, either physically or metaphorically.
