词源:
The word "retrieve" comes from the Old French word "retraire," meaning "to withdraw, retract, or take back."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "retrāhere," which is a combination of the prefix "re-" (back, again) and "trahere" (to draw, pull).  The meaning evolved from the literal act of pulling something back to the more figurative sense of recovering or regaining something lost or misplaced.
