electro-hydraulically: /ˌɪˌlɛktroʊhaɪˈdrɔːlɪkli/ | adv. | 电液地 |  By means of electricity and hydraulics; using a system combining electrical and hydraulic power.  This adverb describes actions or processes that are powered and controlled by a combination of electrical and hydraulic systems. | 例句：The aircraft's flight controls are electro-hydraulically actuated. = 飞机的飞行控制是电液驱动的。

The system is electro-hydraulically operated, providing precise control. = 该系统是电液操作的，提供精确的控制。| 近义词：electromechanically, hydromechanically | 反义词：manually, mechanically (in the context of non-electromechanical operation)
