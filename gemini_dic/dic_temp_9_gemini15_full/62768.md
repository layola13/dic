词源:  The word "engrained" comes from the verb "engrain," which itself is a combination of the prefix "en-" (meaning "in" or "into") and the word "grain."  "Grain" originally referred to the seeds of plants, but later came to refer to the texture or structure of something, particularly wood. Thus, "engrain" originally meant to embed something into the grain of wood, similar to how one might embed seeds in the earth.  Over time, the meaning shifted to refer to the deep embedding of ideas or habits into a person's mind or character.
