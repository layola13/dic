electro-optic: /ˌɛlɛkˈtroʊˈɑːptɪk/ | adj. | 电光学的 | Relating to or utilizing the interaction between light and electricity.  Electro-optic effects are changes in the optical properties of a material (such as refractive index or polarization) in response to an applied electric field.  These effects are exploited in various technologies, including modulators, switches, and sensors. | Example: The electro-optic modulator controlled the intensity of the laser beam. 电光调制器控制着激光束的强度。 | 近义词: optoelectronic | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, as it describes a specific phenomenon)
