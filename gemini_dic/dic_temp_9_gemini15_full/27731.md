The word "canier" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "carrier," "canary," or another word entirely?

2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a proper noun (a name of a person, place, or thing) specific to a certain context or region.  More information is needed to understand its meaning.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word or a slang term not yet widely recognized.

4. **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into standard English.
