nonfissile: /ˈnɒnfɪsaɪl/ | adj. | 不可裂变的；不能裂变的 | Not capable of undergoing nuclear fission.  This term typically refers to materials that cannot sustain a chain reaction of nuclear fission.  | Example: Uranium-238 is a nonfissile isotope, unlike Uranium-235. 铀-238是一种不可裂变的同位素，不像铀-235。| 近义词：infertile, unfissionable | 反义词：fissile


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The material is nonfissile. =这种材料不可裂变。
This substance remains nonfissile. =这种物质仍然不可裂变。


一般过去时:
The scientists confirmed the material was nonfissile. =科学家证实该材料不可裂变。
The test showed the sample to be nonfissile. =测试显示样品不可裂变。


现在完成时:
We have determined that the substance is nonfissile. =我们已经确定该物质不可裂变。
They have proven the material's nonfissile nature. =他们已经证明了该材料的不可裂变性。


过去完成时:
Before the test, they had suspected the material was nonfissile. =在测试之前，他们怀疑该材料不可裂变。
The researchers had already classified the isotope as nonfissile. =研究人员已经将该同位素归类为不可裂变的。


将来时:
This analysis will confirm whether the material is nonfissile. =这项分析将证实该材料是否不可裂变。
Future testing will determine if the substance is nonfissile. =未来的测试将确定该物质是否不可裂变。


虚拟语气:
If the material were nonfissile, it would be safe to handle. =如果该材料不可裂变，则可以安全处理。
I wish we knew for sure if the isotope was nonfissile. =我希望我们能确定该同位素是否不可裂变。


被动语态:
The material was classified as nonfissile. =该材料被归类为不可裂变的。
The sample's nonfissile nature was confirmed by the tests. =样品的不可裂变性得到了测试的证实。


疑问句:
Is the material nonfissile? =该材料不可裂变吗？
Are these isotopes nonfissile? =这些同位素不可裂变吗？


否定句:
The material is not nonfissile; it is fissile. =该材料并非不可裂变；它是可裂变的。
The sample was determined not to be nonfissile. =样品被确定为可裂变的。
