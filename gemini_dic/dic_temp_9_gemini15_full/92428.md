hyponasty:/ˈhaɪpənɑːsti/| n.|下弯性，负向性生长|The upward curvature of a plant organ, such as a leaf or petal, in response to reduced light intensity or other environmental stimuli.  This is in contrast to epinasty, where the organ curves downwards. |Example: The leaves exhibited hyponasty in response to the bright sunlight, curving upwards to reduce exposure.|近义词：epinasty (反义词)|反义词：epinasty
