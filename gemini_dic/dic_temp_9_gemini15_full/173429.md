词源:
The word "quasi-equitable" is a compound word.  "Quasi" is derived from the Latin word "quasi," meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."  "Equitable" comes from the Old French "equitable," ultimately from the Latin "aequus," meaning "equal" or "just."  Therefore, "quasi-equitable" literally means "almost equitable" or "resembling equity."
