词源:
The word "idlesse" is derived from the Old French word "oisiveté,"  which itself comes from "oissif," meaning "idle."  The ultimate root is likely a Germanic word related to Old High German "oudiz," meaning "empty, void," highlighting the sense of emptiness and lack of purpose associated with idleness.
