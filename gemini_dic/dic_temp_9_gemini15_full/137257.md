The word "nonsweeter" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full lexical entry as requested is impossible.  However, we can analyze its potential meaning and structure.


If we break it down:

* **non-**: This is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of."
* **sweeter**: This is the comparative form of the adjective "sweet," meaning "more sweet."

Therefore, "nonsweeter" would logically mean "not sweeter" or "less sweet."  However,  it's grammatically awkward.  A more natural way to express this would be "less sweet," "not as sweet," or "unsweet."

Since it's not a dictionary word, there's no standard pronunciation, word class definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or phrases associated with it.  Any attempt to create these would be speculative and potentially misleading.

To provide something useful, let's analyze how one might use the concept of "not sweeter" in a sentence, using correct English:


**Example using "less sweet":**

"This fruit is less sweet than the one I had yesterday." = 今天的水果不如我昨天吃的那个甜。


**Example using "not as sweet":**

"This cake is not as sweet as I expected." = 这个蛋糕没有我想象的那么甜。


**Example using "unsweet" (for a specific context, like tea):**

"I prefer unsweetened tea." = 我更喜欢不加糖的茶。


In summary, while "nonsweeter" is not a valid word, its intended meaning is clear – it attempts to convey a lack of sweetness.  However, alternative phrasing is needed for proper English grammar.
