myelinic: /maɪˈɛlɪnɪk/ | adj. |髓鞘的；含髓鞘的 | Relating to or characterized by myelin.  Myelin is a fatty substance that forms a sheath around the axons of many nerve fibers, enabling faster transmission of nerve impulses. | The myelinic sheath insulates the nerve fibers, allowing for rapid signal transmission.  髓鞘鞘绝缘神经纤维，允许快速信号传输。 |近义词： myelinated | 反义词：demyelinated


USAGE->
