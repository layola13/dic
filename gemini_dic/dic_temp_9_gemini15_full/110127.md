The word "lidge" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide a response in the requested format.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling of another word.
* It's a very obscure or dialectal term.
* It's a newly coined word or a proper noun (like a place name).

If you can provide more context (e.g., where you encountered this word, a sentence containing it), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
