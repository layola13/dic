词源:

The word "nymph" comes from the Ancient Greek word νύμφη (numphe), meaning "bride," "maiden," or "young woman."  This connection reflects the nymphs' association with youthful beauty and fertility in classical mythology.  The entomological use of the word is a later development, drawing a parallel between the immature insect and the youthful, undeveloped nature of the mythological nymph.
