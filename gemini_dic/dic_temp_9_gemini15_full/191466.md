schizomycetes:/ˌskɪzəˈmaɪsiːts/| n. |分裂菌类；细菌|Schizomycetes is a class of microorganisms characterized by their prokaryotic cellular structure and their mode of reproduction through binary fission. They are predominantly unicellular and lack a membrane-bound nucleus and other organelles.  This term is largely outdated in modern taxonomy, as bacteria are now classified using more sophisticated phylogenetic methods.  However, it's still encountered in older texts. |例句：The study examined the diversity of schizomycetes in the soil samples. 这项研究检查了土壤样本中分裂菌类的多样性。|近义词：bacteria, prokaryotes |反义词：eukaryotes
