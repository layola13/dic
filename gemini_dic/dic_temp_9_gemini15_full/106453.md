The word "{kotki}" is not a standard English word.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?

2. **A word from another language:**  "Kotki" might be a word from a different language, such as Finnish (where it means "cats").  If this is the case, please specify the language of origin.

3. **A proper noun or slang:** It could be a name, nickname, or slang term not found in standard dictionaries.


Without knowing the correct spelling or language origin, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  Please provide more information.
