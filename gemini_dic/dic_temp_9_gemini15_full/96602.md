inductometer:/ɪnˈdʌktəˌmiːtər/ | n. | 电感计 | An instrument for measuring inductance.  It typically consists of a calibrated variable inductor and a means of comparing the inductance of this inductor with the inductance of the unknown inductor.  | Example: The technician used an inductometer to measure the inductance of the coil.  技术员用电感计测量线圈的电感。 |近义词: inductance meter, inductance bridge | 反义词: None.
