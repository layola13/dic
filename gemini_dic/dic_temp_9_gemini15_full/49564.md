词源:  The word "demedicating" is a relatively modern coinage. It's formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse") to the word "medicating" (the act of administering medication).  Therefore, it literally means "removing medication" or "reversing the effects of medication."  There is no established etymology beyond this straightforward derivation.
