palatalise:/ˈpæləteɪz/ | vt. |软腭化，使成软腭音|To make (a sound) articulated with the tongue near the hard palate.  This often involves changing the place of articulation of a consonant from a further back position to a more forward, palatal position.  |例句：In many languages, the /k/ sound palatalizes before a high front vowel, resulting in a /c/ or /ç/ sound.  在许多语言中，/k/音在高前元音前会软腭化，从而产生/c/或/ç/音。

The pronunciation of the word "palatalise" itself can be palatalized in some dialects, with the /l/ becoming a palatalized /lʲ/.  词语“palatalise”本身的发音在某些方言中可能会软腭化，/l/变成软腭化/lʲ/。


近义词：palatalize (same meaning, alternative spelling)


反义词：None directly opposite, but the opposite process could be described as "velarization" (moving the articulation point further back).


词性：verb (transitive)
