词源:
The word "monitor" ultimately derives from the Latin word "monere," meaning "to warn" or "to advise."  Through Old French, the word evolved to mean someone who warns or advises, and then to someone who keeps watch or supervises.  The modern sense of a display device came later, reflecting the device's function in displaying information and warnings.
