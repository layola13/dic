impedance:/ɪmˈpiːdəns/| n. |阻抗|The opposition to the flow of alternating current in an electrical circuit, comprising resistance and reactance.  It's a measure of how much a circuit resists the flow of current when an alternating voltage is applied.  |Example:  The impedance of the speaker was too high for the amplifier.  扬声器的阻抗对于放大器来说太高了。

The impedance matching between the audio source and the headphones is crucial for optimal sound quality. 音频源和耳机之间的阻抗匹配对于最佳音质至关重要。|近义词：resistance (in a DC circuit), opposition|反义词：conductance
