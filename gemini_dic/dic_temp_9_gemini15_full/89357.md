homomorphisms:/ˈhɒməmɔːrfɪzəm/| n. |同态映射|A homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures (such as groups, rings, or vector spaces).  It preserves the operations defined on these structures. For example, a group homomorphism preserves the group operation. |Example:  The map f: (ℝ, +) → (ℝ+, ×) defined by f(x) = eˣ is a homomorphism between the additive group of real numbers and the multiplicative group of positive real numbers, because f(x + y) = eˣ⁺ʸ = eˣ * eʸ = f(x) * f(y).  |近义词：isomorphism (if bijective), mapping|反义词：无


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in abstract algebra and related mathematical fields.  Therefore, providing grammatical examples in the same way as the "what" example is not appropriate.  Instead, here are examples illustrating different contexts of usage within mathematical discourse:

Example 1 (Group Homomorphism):
Let φ: G → H be a group homomorphism.  Then φ(xy) = φ(x)φ(y) for all x, y ∈ G. =  设 φ: G → H 为一个群同态。则对于所有 x, y ∈ G，φ(xy) = φ(x)φ(y)。


Example 2 (Ring Homomorphism):
A ring homomorphism between rings R and S is a function f: R → S such that f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) and f(ab) = f(a)f(b) for all a, b ∈ R. = 环 R 和 S 之间的环同态是一个函数 f: R → S，使得对于所有 a, b ∈ R，f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b) 且 f(ab) = f(a)f(b)。


Example 3 (Linear Transformation as a Vector Space Homomorphism):
A linear transformation between vector spaces is a homomorphism. = 向量空间之间的线性变换是一个同态映射。


Example 4 (Discussion of Homomorphism Properties):
The kernel of a homomorphism is a normal subgroup.  = 同态的核是一个正规子群。


Example 5 (Proof involving Homomorphisms):
We can use the first isomorphism theorem to prove that... = 我们可以用第一同构定理来证明……
