词源:
The word "quasi-rationally" is derived from the prefix "quasi-" (meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent") and the adverb "rationally" (meaning "in a rational manner").  Therefore, it describes actions or decisions that exhibit some characteristics of rationality but are not fully or perfectly rational.
