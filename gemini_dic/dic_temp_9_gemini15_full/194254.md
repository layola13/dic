USAGE->

PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "self-murderers". The term itself is outdated and should be avoided.


词源:
The word is a compound of "self" and "murderers".  "Self" refers to oneself, and "murderers" refers to those who commit murder.  The combination directly indicates those who commit murder against themselves.  The term is considered archaic because the word "murder" implies malice aforethought, which is not always the case with suicide.  Modern understanding of suicide emphasizes mental health and other underlying factors.
