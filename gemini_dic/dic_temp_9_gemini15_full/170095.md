prothyalosome:/ˌproʊθaɪˈæləˌsoʊm/| n. |原肠体|A prothyalosome is a hypothetical developmental stage in the early development of certain animals, particularly those with radial symmetry. It is believed to be a transitional stage between the blastula and the gastrula, characterized by the formation of a primitive gut cavity or archenteron.  The exact nature and existence of the prothyalosome are still debated among developmental biologists.| The proposed prothyalosome stage in jellyfish development highlights the complexities of early metazoan evolution. | 近义词: (There are no perfect synonyms as the term is highly specialized and debated.) | 反义词: (No direct antonyms exist.)


USAGE->
This word is highly specialized and its usage is primarily confined to academic papers and discussions within developmental biology.  Therefore, providing examples across various tenses is not practical.  It's used primarily in descriptive contexts.

Example 1:
"The formation of the prothyalosome is hypothesized to occur through invagination of the blastula wall." = 原肠体的形成被假设是通过囊胚壁的内陷发生的。

Example 2:
"Further research is needed to confirm the existence and significance of the prothyalosome in the evolutionary history of metazoans." = 需要进一步的研究来证实原肠体在后生动物进化史中的存在和意义。


PHRASE->
This word does not commonly appear in phrases.  Its highly technical nature limits its combinatorial use.
