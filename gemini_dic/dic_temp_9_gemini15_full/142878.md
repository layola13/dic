词源:
The term "out-of-pocket" is a relatively modern idiom.  "Out-of" indicates something is external or separate from a system, while "pocket" refers to personal funds.  Therefore, "out-of-pocket" expenses are those paid from one's own resources, not from a third-party source like insurance.  The phrase developed naturally from the common experience of paying for things directly from one's pocket.
