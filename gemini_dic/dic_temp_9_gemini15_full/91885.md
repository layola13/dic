hyperintensenesses:/ˌhaɪpərɪnˈtɛnsɪnɛsɪz/ | n. |高度密集；极度强烈；(信号的)高强度 |The word "hyperintensenesses" is an extremely rare and unusual word, formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to the already complex word "hyperintenseness".  It suggests multiple instances of extreme intensity or high signal strength.  It's not a word found in standard dictionaries and its usage would be highly specialized, likely in fields like medical imaging where signal intensity is measured.  For example, it might describe multiple areas in a brain scan showing exceptionally high signal intensity.  The word is essentially a plural form of "hyperintenseness," which itself is not commonly used. |Example: The MRI scans revealed multiple hyperintensenesses in the patient's brain, indicating potential damage.  大脑MRI扫描显示患者大脑中存在多个高强度区域，表明可能有损伤。 |近义词: high intensities, extreme intensities, multiple signal peaks |反义词: low intensities, weak signals |名词
