pyrosome:/ˈpaɪrəˌsoʊm/| n. |浮游动物群体|A pyrosome is a free-floating colonial tunicate, a type of invertebrate marine animal.  These organisms are composed of hundreds or thousands of individual zooids, which are genetically identical and work together as a single unit.  They are often bioluminescent, meaning they can produce light, creating a stunning spectacle in the ocean.  Pyrosomes are filter feeders, consuming plankton and other microscopic organisms. |Example:  The divers were amazed by the giant pyrosome they encountered during their deep-sea exploration.  潜水员们对他们在深海探险中遇到的巨大浮游动物群体感到惊奇。  The shimmering pyrosome pulsed with light as it drifted through the water. 发光的浮游动物群体在水中漂流时发出脉冲光。|近义词：tunicate colony, colonial organism|反义词：N/A|名词
