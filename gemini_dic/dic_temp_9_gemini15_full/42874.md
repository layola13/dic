词源:
The word "courting" comes from the Old French word "courter," meaning "to behave courteously," "to pay court to," or "to frequent the court of a ruler."  This ultimately derives from the Latin word "cursus," meaning "running" or "course," suggesting the idea of moving around and attending to someone's needs.  The shift in meaning from general courtesy to romantic pursuit developed over time.
