The word "meeter" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  It's possible that:

1. It's a misspelling:  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "meter," "meet her," or another word entirely.
2. It's a neologism or slang: A newly coined word or term used within a specific community or context.
3. It's a proper noun:  A name or place name.


If you could clarify the intended word or provide more context, I can offer a more accurate analysis.
