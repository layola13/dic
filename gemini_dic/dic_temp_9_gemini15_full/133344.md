nonextensional:/ˌnɒnɪkˈstɛnʃənəl/| adj. |非外延的，非指称的 |Not concerned with the referents of expressions but only with their senses or meanings.  A nonextensional context is one in which substituting expressions with the same referent does not preserve the truth value.  | Example: "The morning star is the evening star" is true, but "It is known that the morning star is the evening star" is not necessarily true.  In this sentence the truth value is not only determined by the referent(the planet Venus), but also by the knowledge of the speaker.  |近义词： intensional |反义词： extensional
