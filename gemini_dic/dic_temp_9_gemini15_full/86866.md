hemimetabola: /ˌhɛmiˈmɛtəbəlɑː/ | n. | 半变态发育 | Incomplete metamorphosis; a type of insect development in which the immature form (nymph) gradually resembles the adult form without a pupal stage.  The nymphs typically live in the same habitat as the adults and feed on similar foods. Examples include grasshoppers, dragonflies, and cockroaches. |  Grasshoppers exhibit hemimetabola, gradually developing from nymphs to adults. = 蝗虫表现出半变态发育，逐渐从若虫发育到成虫。

The development of termites follows a hemimetabolic pattern. = 白蚁的发育遵循半变态模式。


近义词: incomplete metamorphosis, gradual metamorphosis | 反义词: holometabola (complete metamorphosis)


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the field of entomology (the study of insects).  Therefore, tense usage would be within the context of describing insect life cycles.  Examples below illustrate this:

一般现在时:
Grasshoppers undergo hemimetabola. = 蝗虫经历半变态发育。
Dragonflies exhibit hemimetabola during their development. = 蜻蜓在发育过程中表现出半变态发育。


一般过去时:
The researchers observed hemimetabola in the specimen. = 研究人员在样本中观察到半变态发育。
This species was found to undergo hemimetabola. = 发现该物种经历了半变态发育。


现在完成时:
Scientists have documented hemimetabola in many insect groups. = 科学家们已经记录了许多昆虫类群的半变态发育。
Entomologists have long studied the process of hemimetabola. = 昆虫学家们长期以来一直在研究半变态发育的过程。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, little was known about the hemimetabola of this species. = 在发现之前，人们对该物种的半变态发育知之甚少。
They had already observed the hemimetabola in earlier studies. = 他们在早期的研究中已经观察到半变态发育。


将来时:
Future studies will likely reveal more about the intricacies of hemimetabola. = 未来的研究可能会揭示更多关于半变态发育的复杂细节。
We will further investigate the evolutionary aspects of hemimetabola in this insect. = 我们将进一步研究这种昆虫的半变态发育的进化方面。


虚拟语气:
If the insect exhibited hemimetabola, it would not have a pupal stage. = 如果昆虫表现出半变态发育，它就不会有蛹期。
It would be helpful if we had more data on the hemimetabola of this species. = 如果我们有更多关于该物种半变态发育的数据，那就太好了。


被动语态:
Hemimetabola is characterized by gradual changes in the nymph. = 半变态发育的特点是若虫的逐渐变化。
The process of hemimetabola was extensively studied by the researchers. = 半变态发育的过程被研究人员广泛研究。


疑问句:
Does this insect species exhibit hemimetabola? = 这个昆虫物种是否表现出半变态发育？
What are the key characteristics of hemimetabola? = 半变态发育的关键特征是什么？


否定句:
This insect does not undergo hemimetabola; it undergoes complete metamorphosis. = 这种昆虫不经历半变态发育；它经历完全变态发育。
The study did not find evidence of hemimetabola in the sample. = 这项研究没有在样本中发现半变态发育的证据。



PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases using "hemimetabola" as it's a technical term.  Phrases would be built around it describing the insect's development:

hemimetabolous development = 半变态发育
stages of hemimetabola = 半变态发育阶段
hemimetabola in insects = 昆虫的半变态发育
example of hemimetabola = 半变态发育的例子
hemimetabola vs holometabola = 半变态发育与完全变态发育
