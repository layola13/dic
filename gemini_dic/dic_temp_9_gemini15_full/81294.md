词源:  The word "granularity" derives from the word "granule," meaning a small grain or particle.  The suffix "-arity" is used to form nouns indicating a quality or state, resulting in "granularity" signifying the quality or state of being granular or composed of granules.  The ultimate origin traces back to the Latin word "granulum," a diminutive of "granum," meaning "grain."
