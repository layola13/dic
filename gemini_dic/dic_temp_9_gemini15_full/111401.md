livingnesses: /ˈlɪvɪŋnəsɪz/ | n. | 活力状态，生存状态的多种表现 | The various ways in which living things exhibit life;  a collection or multitude of living states or conditions.  This word is extremely rare and largely considered non-standard English. It's formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to "living," attempting to create a plural or collective noun form referring to multiple instances of "livingness." However, "livingness" itself is already a noun, making the formation of "livingnesses" grammatically awkward and semantically unclear. |  There are no readily available examples of this word's use in reputable sources because it is not a standard word.  A potential (contrived) example would be: "The biologist studied the various livingnesses exhibited by the organisms in the different habitats." This sentence attempts to use the word but highlights its unusual and unnatural nature. |  近义词: manifestations of life, vitalities, states of existence  | 反义词:  death, lifelessness, inanimate states | 名词
