reductionist: /rɪˈdʌkʃənɪst/ | adj. | 还原论的；简化论的 |  A reductionist approach simplifies a complex system by breaking it down into its smaller, constituent parts to understand its behavior. It often focuses on the individual components rather than the interactions between them.  This approach can be helpful in certain contexts, but it may also oversimplify the system and miss important emergent properties. | Example:  The reductionist explanation of consciousness as merely neural activity overlooks the subjective experience of being aware.  The reductionist view of society ignores the complex interplay of individual actions and cultural influences. | 近义词: simplistic, oversimplified, mechanistic | 反义词: holistic, comprehensive, systemic

词源:

The philosophical roots lie in the idea of reducing complex phenomena to simpler, more fundamental components.
