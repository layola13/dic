overchafed: /ˌoʊvərˈtʃeɪfd/ | adj. |过度摩擦的，磨损过度;过度刺激的|  This word is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It appears to be a newly coined or rarely used word formed by combining "over" and "chafed."  "Chafed" itself means irritated or sore from rubbing. Therefore, "overchafed" likely implies excessive rubbing or irritation leading to a heightened state of soreness or discomfort.  There are no standard examples, synonyms, or antonyms because it's not a recognized word.  The usage would depend entirely on the context in which it is used, and it might be considered informal or non-standard.
