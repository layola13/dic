词源：
The word "overdenunciations" is a compound word formed from "over-" (meaning excessively or to an excessive degree) and "denunciations" (the act of publicly accusing someone of wrongdoing).  "Denunciation" itself comes from the Latin "denuntiatio,"  a combination of "de-" (down, away) and "nuntiatio" (a proclaiming, announcing).
