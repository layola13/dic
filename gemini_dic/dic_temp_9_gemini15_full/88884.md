The word "hokeyer" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Please double-check the spelling.
2. **It's a regional dialect word:**  It might be used informally in a specific geographic area or community.  Providing more context (where you encountered the word) would be helpful.
3. **It's a newly coined word or a proper noun:** It could be a very recent invention, a name, or a brand.


Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format, because the word doesn't exist in standard English dictionaries.  Please clarify or provide more information.
