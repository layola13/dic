词源:  The word "injurable" derives from the verb "injure," which comes from the Old French word "injurier," meaning "to insult, to wrong." Over time, the meaning shifted to focus on physical harm. The suffix "-able" indicates capability or susceptibility.  Thus, "injurable" means capable of being injured.
