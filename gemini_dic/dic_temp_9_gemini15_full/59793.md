ecotype:/ˈiːkəʊtaɪp/| n. |生态型，生态变型|A population adapted to a particular environment. Ecotypes are distinct forms of a species that are adapted to different habitats. They may have different morphological, physiological, and genetic characteristics.  Ecotypes arise through natural selection, where individuals with traits that enhance survival and reproduction in a specific environment are more likely to pass on those traits to their offspring.|Example:  The coastal ecotype of the plant showed greater salt tolerance than the inland ecotype.  沿海地区的这种植物生态型比内陆地区的这种植物生态型更耐盐。|近义词：variant, strain, subspecies|反义词：无
