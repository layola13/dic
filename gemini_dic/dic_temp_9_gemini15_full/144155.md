词源:

The word "outshine" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "surpass," "exceed," or "better") and the verb "shine" (meaning "to emit light," "to be bright," or "to excel").  Therefore, "outshine" literally means "to shine more brightly than," or "to excel more than."  Its origins trace back to the Old English word "scinan," meaning "to shine."  The prefix "out-" has Germanic roots.
