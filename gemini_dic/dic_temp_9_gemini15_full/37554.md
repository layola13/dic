词源:

The word "commonweal" is derived from the Old English "gemæne gewealdu," where "gemæne" means "common" and "gewealdu" means "power" or "governance."  Over time, this evolved into "commonweal," reflecting the idea of the shared power or governance benefiting the entire community.  The shift from "power" to "well-being" reflects a broadening of the concept over the centuries.
