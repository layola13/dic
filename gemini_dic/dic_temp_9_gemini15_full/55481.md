词源:

Distractedness comes from the adjective "distracted," which in turn derives from the verb "distract."  "Distract" originates from the Old French word "distraire," meaning "to draw away, divert."  This further breaks down into "dis-" (away) and "trahere" (to draw). The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality.
