The word "preincreases" does not exist in standard English.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  It seems to be an attempt to combine "pre-" (meaning before) and "increases" (plural of increase).  Therefore, a proper analysis cannot be provided.  To offer help, one would need to know the intended meaning or context in which this word was used.  If you can provide more context, I can attempt to understand the intended meaning and offer an analysis of a similar, correctly spelled word or phrase.
