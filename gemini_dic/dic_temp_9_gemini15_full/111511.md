loan-translations: /ˈloʊn trænzˈleɪʃənz/ | n. | 借词翻译，音译 |  The process of translating a word or phrase by finding a similar-sounding word or phrase in the target language, rather than a direct semantic equivalent. This often results in words or phrases that don't share a common etymological root but have a similar sound and sometimes meaning.  | Example:  The Japanese word "漫画" (manga) is a loan-translation from the English words "comics" and "cartoons," reflecting the similar sound and concept. | 近义词：calque, semantic loan | 反义词：literal translation
