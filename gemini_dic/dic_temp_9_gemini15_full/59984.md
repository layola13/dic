词源:
From Middle English *editen, from Old French editer ("to edit, publish"), from Latin ēdĭtō ("he publishes"), the third-person singular perfect active indicative of ēdĕre ("to publish, issue, give out, edit").  The Latin root further traces back to Proto-Italic *ēd- ("to give, to eat"), which connects to Proto-Indo-European *h₁éd- ("to eat").  While seemingly unrelated, the sense of "giving out" or "issuing" in the Latin evolved into the modern meaning of preparing something for publication or distribution.
