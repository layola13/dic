词源:
The word "detractress" is derived from the verb "detract," which comes from the Latin prefix "de-" (away, from) and the verb "trahere" (to draw).  Therefore, "detract" means "to draw away from" or "to diminish." The suffix "-ress" is a feminine suffix, indicating a female agent.  It's a relatively rare word, often seen as a more emphatic or literary alternative to "detractor".
