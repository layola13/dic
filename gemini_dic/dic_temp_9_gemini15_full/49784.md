词源:  The word "demonish" is derived from the Old French word "demoner," meaning "to accuse; to denounce."  This in turn has roots in the Latin word "demonstrāre," meaning "to show; to point out; to prove." While the original meaning focused on accusation, the modern usage has shifted to emphasizing the scolding or rebuking aspect.
