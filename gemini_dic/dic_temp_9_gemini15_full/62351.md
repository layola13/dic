The word "enderon" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you intended another word?  If you can provide the context where you encountered this word, it might be possible to guess the intended word.
* **A neologism or technical term:** It could be a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field (science, literature, etc.).  Again, context is crucial.
* **A proper noun:** It might be a name or place name.
