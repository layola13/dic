词源:
The word "raiser" comes from the verb "raise," which has Old English roots.  The Old English word "rǣsan" meant "to lift up, raise."  Over time, its meaning broadened to include the concepts of rearing (as in raising children or animals), increasing (as in raising prices), and collecting (as in raising money).  The noun "raiser" simply denotes the person or thing that performs the action of raising.
