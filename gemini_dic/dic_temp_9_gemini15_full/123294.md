monogenic:/ˌmɒnəˈdʒɛnɪk/|/ˌmɑːnəˈdʒɛnɪk/| adj. | 单基因的；单基因遗传的 | Relating to or determined by a single gene.  A monogenic trait is controlled by variations in a single gene.  | Example: Cystic fibrosis is a monogenic disorder.  囊性纤维化是一种单基因遗传病。  |近义词: single-gene, unifactorial | 反义词: polygenic, multifactorial


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The disease is monogenic. = 这种疾病是单基因遗传的。
This trait is determined by a monogenic inheritance pattern. =  此性状由单基因遗传模式决定。

一般过去时:
Scientists discovered that the condition was monogenic. = 科学家们发现这种情况是单基因遗传的。
Researchers determined the trait was monogenic in nature. = 研究人员确定该性状本质上是单基因遗传的。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several monogenic diseases. = 研究人员已经确定了几种单基因遗传病。
Scientists have confirmed that the disorder has a monogenic origin. = 科学家们已经证实这种疾病起源于单基因。


过去完成时:
Before the study, it was believed that the disease was not monogenic. = 在这项研究之前，人们认为这种疾病不是单基因遗传的。
They had already suspected that the inheritance pattern was monogenic. = 他们之前已经怀疑遗传模式是单基因遗传的。


将来时:
Future research will focus on identifying more monogenic diseases.= 未来的研究将集中在识别更多单基因遗传病。
We will explore the possibility that the condition is monogenic. = 我们将探讨这种情况是单基因遗传的可能性。


虚拟语气:
If the disease were monogenic, treatment would be simpler. = 如果这种疾病是单基因遗传的，治疗就会更简单。
I wish we knew whether the disorder was monogenic or polygenic. = 我希望我们知道这种疾病是单基因遗传还是多基因遗传。


被动语态:
Many monogenic disorders have been identified. = 许多单基因遗传病已被发现。
The cause of the disease was determined to be monogenic. = 这种疾病的原因被确定为单基因遗传。


疑问句:
Is this disease monogenic or polygenic? = 这种疾病是单基因遗传还是多基因遗传？
Is the inheritance pattern of this trait monogenic? = 此性状的遗传模式是单基因遗传的吗？


否定句:
The disease is not monogenic; it's polygenic. = 这种疾病不是单基因遗传的；它是多基因遗传的。
This trait is not determined by a monogenic inheritance pattern. = 此性状并非由单基因遗传模式决定。


PHRASE->
monogenic inheritance = 单基因遗传
monogenic disorder = 单基因遗传病
monogenic trait = 单基因性状
monogenic mutation = 单基因突变
monogenic disease gene = 单基因疾病基因
