词源:
The word is a combination of "quasi," meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent," and "personally," meaning "in a personal manner."  Therefore, "quasi-personally" indicates an action or involvement that resembles a personal one but lacks the full characteristics of true personal engagement.
