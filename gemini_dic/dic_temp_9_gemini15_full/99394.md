interdifferentiated: /ˌɪntərˌdɪfəˈrenʃieɪtɪd/ | adj. | 差异化分化的；相互区别的 |  Describes a state or process where different parts or aspects of something are distinguished or specialized, often in a way that involves interaction and mutual influence.  This word combines the prefix "inter-" (between, among), "differentiated" (distinguished, specialized), implying a complex process of distinction among interacting elements.   | The study revealed an interdifferentiated system of social roles within the community.  | 近义词: specialized, diversified, heterogeneous | 反义词: homogeneous, undifferentiated, uniform
