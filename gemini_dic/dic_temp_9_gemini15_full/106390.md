The word "kood" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  If you can provide context (a sentence where you saw it), it might help to determine the intended word.
* **It's a proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (a name of a person, place, or thing) not found in general dictionaries.
* **It's slang or jargon:** It might be slang, jargon specific to a certain field or community, or a newly coined word not yet widely used.
* **It's a word from another language:**  It could be a word borrowed from another language.


To help me analyze the word, please provide more information about where you encountered it and the surrounding context.
