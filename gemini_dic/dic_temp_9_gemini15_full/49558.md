词源:

The word "demeanour" comes from the Old French word "demener," meaning "to conduct oneself," "to behave," or "to manage."  This in turn has roots in the Latin word "deminari," which means "to diminish" or "to lessen."  While the Latin root might seem contradictory to the modern meaning, the original sense likely referred to a way of behaving that could either enhance or diminish one's reputation.
