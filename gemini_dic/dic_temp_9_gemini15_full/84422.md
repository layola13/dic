词源:

The name "Hallstatt" is derived from the Old High German words *hal(s)  (salt) and *statt (place).  Therefore, it literally means "salt place" or "salt town".  This reflects the village's historical significance as a major salt production center during the Bronze Age and beyond.  The Hallstatt culture, a significant prehistoric culture of Europe, is named after the village due to the discovery of rich archaeological findings in the area.
