The word "concrew" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific jargon or dialect, or a made-up word.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer a more informed response.
