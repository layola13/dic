词源:

The word "ratatouille" comes from the Provençal dialect of Occitan,  a language spoken in southern France.  It's derived from the verb "ratatolhar," meaning "to mend, to patch up,"  reflecting the way the dish was originally made using whatever vegetables were available.  The word entered English in the late 19th century.
