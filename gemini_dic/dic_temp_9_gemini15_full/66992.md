"Expert" originates from the Old French "expert," meaning "skilled," "experienced," or "tried."  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix forming nouns that denote a state, quality, or condition. Therefore, "expertness" means the state or quality of being expert, and "expertnesses" indicates multiple such states or qualities.
