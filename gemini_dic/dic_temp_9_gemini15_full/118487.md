词源:
The word "mesmerised" comes from the name of Franz Mesmer (1734-1815), an Austrian physician who developed a therapeutic technique called "mesmerism," which involved inducing a trance-like state in patients using magnetic passes.  Although his theories were later discredited, the term "mesmerism" and its derivatives, including "mesmerised," remain in use to describe a state of captivated fascination or hypnotic trance.
