heteroecious:/ˌhɛtəˈroʊʃəs/| adj.|异主的；（寄生物）转主寄生的|Having more than one host in the life cycle, especially of a parasite or pathogen.  This term is primarily used in biology and particularly in the study of parasites and plant pathogens.  It describes organisms that require different host species to complete their life cycle.  For example, a heteroecious rust fungus might require one host plant for its asexual reproduction and a different host plant for sexual reproduction.| Example:  The rust fungus is heteroecious, requiring both wheat and barberry for its complete life cycle.  异锈菌是异主的，其完整的生命周期需要小麦和小檗两种植物。|近义词：polyxenous|反义词：autoecious


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The rust fungus is heteroecious. = 锈菌是异主的。
This parasite requires two different hosts. = 这种寄生虫需要两种不同的寄主。


一般过去时:
The researchers discovered that the fungus was heteroecious. = 研究人员发现这种真菌是异主的。
The study showed the parasite needed two hosts to complete its life cycle. = 研究表明，这种寄生虫需要两个宿主才能完成其生命周期。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified many heteroecious plant pathogens. = 科学家已经鉴定了许多异主植物病原体。
We have learned that some parasites require multiple hosts. = 我们已经了解到有些寄生虫需要多个寄主。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, it was unknown that the fungus was heteroecious. = 在发现之前，人们不知道这种真菌是异主的。
They had not realised that the parasite needed two different hosts. = 他们没有意识到这种寄生虫需要两种不同的寄主。


将来时:
Further research will reveal more heteroecious species. = 进一步的研究将揭示更多异主物种。
Scientists will continue to study parasites that require multiple hosts. = 科学家将继续研究需要多个宿主的寄生虫。


虚拟语气:
If the parasite were heteroecious, it would require two hosts. = 如果这种寄生虫是异主的，它将需要两个寄主。
If this fungus were autoecious, it would not need two hosts. = 如果这种真菌是自主的，它将不需要两个寄主。


被动语态:
Many heteroecious species have been identified. = 许多异主物种已被鉴定。
The life cycle of the parasite was found to be heteroecious. = 发现这种寄生虫的生命周期是异主的。


疑问句:
Is this parasite heteroecious or autoecious? = 这种寄生虫是异主的还是自主的？
Does this fungus require more than one host? = 这种真菌是否需要多个寄主？


否定句:
This particular fungus is not heteroecious; it only needs one host. = 这种特殊的真菌不是异主的；它只需要一个寄主。
The pathogen does not require two different plant hosts. = 该病原体不需要两种不同的植物寄主。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "heteroecious" as it's a highly specific scientific term.  Instead, phrases would describe the heteroecious nature of an organism.  For example:

"A heteroecious life cycle..." = 一个异主的生命周期...
"Exhibiting heteroecious behavior..." = 表现出异主行为...
"The heteroecious nature of..." = ...的异主特性
"Requires a heteroecious host" = 需要异主寄主
"Completing its heteroecious cycle" = 完成其异主循环
