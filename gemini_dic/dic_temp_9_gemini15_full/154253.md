词源:

The word "perishability" is derived from the verb "perish," meaning to die or be destroyed.  "Perish" itself comes from the Old French *perir* and ultimately from the Latin *perire*, meaning "to go to ruin," "to be lost," or "to perish." The suffix "-ability" denotes the capacity or quality of being able to do something, in this case, the capacity to perish or decay.
