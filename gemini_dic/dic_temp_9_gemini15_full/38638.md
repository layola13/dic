词源:
The word "concupiscential" comes from the Late Latin word *concupiscibilis*, meaning "desirable," from the verb *concupiscere*, meaning "to desire eagerly," "to lust after."  This in turn derives from *con* (together) and *cupīre* (to desire).  The English word thus carries the historical weight of a strong, often uncontrolled, desire.
