词源:
The verb "prioritize" is a relatively modern word, formed by adding the suffix "-ize" (meaning "to make" or "to treat as") to the adjective "prior."  "Prior" itself comes from the Old French "prior," ultimately from the Latin "prior," meaning "former" or "that which comes before."  Thus, "prioritize" literally means "to treat as something that comes before" or "to give precedence to."
