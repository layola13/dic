词源:
The word "corn" comes from the Old English word "corn," meaning "grain."  This Old English word is ultimately of Proto-Germanic origin. The meaning shifted over time, with "corn" in British English now mostly referring to wheat, and in American English primarily to maize.  This semantic shift reflects the different dominant cereal crops in the two regions.
