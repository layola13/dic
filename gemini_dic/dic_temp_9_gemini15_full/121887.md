词源:
The phrasal verb "miss out on" combines the verb "miss" (meaning to fail to obtain or experience something) with the preposition "on," indicating the object or target of the missing.  The meaning evolved naturally from the literal sense of missing something to the figurative sense of missing out on opportunities or experiences.
