This term often relates to the efficiency or percentage of a substance that can be successfully removed from a source using a particular extraction method.  It's frequently used in fields like chemistry, environmental science, and pharmaceuticals.|例句：The extractabilities of the active compounds from the plant material were determined using supercritical fluid extraction. 植物材料中活性化合物的可提取性是使用超临界流体萃取法确定的。

The study focused on improving the extractabilities of valuable components from the waste stream.  该研究侧重于提高废物流中宝贵成分的可提取性。|近义词：extractability, recovery yield, recovery rate|反义词：inextractability

USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "hello".  Its usage focuses on describing the degree to which something can be extracted.  Therefore, tense changes are reflected in the sentences describing the extraction process itself, not the word "extractabilities" directly.

Example sentences showing usage in different contexts:

Present Simple: The extractabilities of these metals are high using this solvent.  这些金属使用这种溶剂的可提取性很高。

Past Simple: The researchers found that the extractabilities were significantly affected by temperature. 研究人员发现可提取性受温度影响很大。

Present Perfect:  Scientists have improved the extractabilities of many valuable compounds. 科学家们已经提高了许多宝贵化合物的可提取性。

Future Simple: We anticipate that the new method will increase the extractabilities. 我们预计新方法将提高可提取性。


PHRASE->
high extractabilities 高可提取性
low extractabilities 低可提取性
optimal extractabilities 最佳可提取性
determining extractabilities 测定可提取性
improving extractabilities 提高可提取性
