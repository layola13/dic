chromophore:/ˈkroʊməfɔːr/|/ˈkrəʊməfɔːr/| n. |生色团|A chromophore is the part of a molecule responsible for its color.  It is a chemical group that absorbs light in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum, causing the molecule to appear colored. The absorption of light by a chromophore is due to the presence of conjugated double bonds, which allow for the delocalization of electrons.  This delocalization of electrons allows the chromophore to absorb photons of specific wavelengths, resulting in the selective absorption of certain colors of light and the reflection or transmission of others, thereby producing color. |Example:  The chromophore in beta-carotene is responsible for its orange color.  β-胡萝卜素中的生色团使其呈现橙色。  Many dyes and pigments contain chromophores. 许多染料和颜料都含有生色团。|近义词：colorant, pigment|反义词：achromophore (this is rarely used)|名词
