词源:  The word "indignity" comes from the Old French word "indignite," meaning "unworthiness," which itself derives from the Latin word "indignus," meaning "unworthy" or "undeserving."  The prefix "in-" means "not," and "dignitas" means "worthiness" or "dignity." Therefore, "indignity" literally means "unworthiness" or an act that reflects unworthiness.
