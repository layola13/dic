The word "remated" is not a standard English word found in common dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological breakdown and usage examples are impossible to provide.  It's likely a misspelling, a newly coined word, or a word specific to a particular field or dialect.

If you could provide context where you encountered this word, it might be possible to offer a more informed interpretation.  For example, is it possibly a combination of "re-" and another word?  Knowing the context would help determine the intended meaning.
