The word "permanable" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following your requested format.  To help, I need clarification on what word you intended to use.  If you can provide the correct spelling or the intended meaning, I can offer the analysis.
