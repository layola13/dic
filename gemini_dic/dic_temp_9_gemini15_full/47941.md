decibel:/ˈdɛsɪbɛl/ | n. |分贝|A unit used to measure the intensity of a sound or other signal, on a logarithmic scale.  It is based on the power ratio of the signal to a reference level.  A decibel is one tenth of a bel (a rarely used unit).|The sound of the jet engine was over 120 decibels.  飞机引擎的声音超过120分贝。|近义词：dB (abbreviation)|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The machine produces 80 decibels of noise. = 这台机器产生80分贝的噪音。
This speaker system outputs 100 decibels at maximum volume. = 这个音响系统在最大音量下输出100分贝。


一般过去时:
The concert reached 110 decibels at its peak. = 音乐会在高峰时达到110分贝。
The noise level yesterday was only 60 decibels. = 昨天的噪音水平只有60分贝。


现在完成时:
The factory has reduced its noise output to below 85 decibels. = 工厂已将噪音输出降低到85分贝以下。
They have measured the decibel level several times. = 他们已经测量了几次分贝水平。


过去完成时:
The sound had already reached dangerous decibel levels before we realized it. = 在我们意识到之前，声音已经达到危险的分贝水平。
The engineers had lowered the decibel level before the inspection. = 工程师在检查前降低了分贝水平。


将来时:
The new regulations will limit the noise to 70 decibels. = 新规定将噪音限制在70分贝以内。
We will measure the decibel levels throughout the day. = 我们将全天测量分贝水平。


虚拟语气:
If the sound system were louder, it would exceed 100 decibels. = 如果音响系统更大声，它将超过100分贝。
I wish the traffic noise were lower than 75 decibels. = 我希望交通噪音低于75分贝。


被动语态:
The decibel level was carefully monitored throughout the experiment. = 在整个实验过程中，分贝水平都受到了仔细监测。
The noise pollution is being measured in decibels. = 噪音污染正在以分贝为单位进行测量。


疑问句:
What is the decibel level of this machine? = 这台机器的分贝水平是多少？
How many decibels can this amplifier produce? = 这个放大器能产生多少分贝？


否定句:
The noise level did not exceed the legal limit of 70 decibels. = 噪音水平没有超过70分贝的法定限值。
This device does not produce harmful decibel levels. = 此设备不会产生有害的分贝水平。


PHRASE->
decibel level = 分贝水平
decibel meter = 分贝计
sound decibels = 声音分贝
noise decibels = 噪音分贝
measure decibels = 测量分贝


词源:
The word "decibel" is a combination of "deci-" (meaning "one tenth") and "bel," a unit named after Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone.  The bel itself is rarely used; the decibel is a more practical unit for measuring sound intensity.
