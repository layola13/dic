词源:
From Middle French prostitution, from Late Latin prostitutionem (nominative prostitutio), from Latin prostituere "to expose publicly, prostitute," from pro "forth, forward" + statuere "to set, place, establish."  The original meaning referred to the public display of something, not just sexual services.
