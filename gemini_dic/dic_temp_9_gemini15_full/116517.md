The word "mateynesses" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a standard dictionary definition, etymology, and usage examples cannot be provided.  To analyze it, we need to consider possible origins and intended meanings.

It seems to be an attempt to create a plural noun, possibly from a base word like "matey" (meaning friendly or jovial) or a related word.  However, the "-nesses" suffix is usually added to adjectives to form abstract nouns signifying a quality or state (e.g., "greatness," "kindness").  Its application to "matey" creates a word that's grammatically unusual and semantically unclear.

To provide a meaningful analysis, we would need additional context: Where did you encounter this word? What was the surrounding text?  With more information, we could speculate on the intended meaning and perhaps offer a plausible interpretation.  For example, it *might* be interpreted informally as something like "friendly qualities" or "acts of camaraderie," but this is pure speculation without context.
