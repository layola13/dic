USAGE->
This word is not a standard English word.  It's likely a non-standard or invented word formed by adding the superlative suffix "-est" to "end."  Therefore, it doesn't have standard grammatical usage examples like "what" does.  It would be inappropriate to provide examples of tense, mood, or voice for a word that is not part of standard English vocabulary.

PHRASE->
There are no established phrases using "endest."  Since the word is not standard English, creating phrases would be arbitrary and unproductive.
