词源:  The word "repertoire" comes from the French word "répertoire," ultimately derived from the Old French "repertoir," meaning "index," "directory," or "list."  This, in turn, comes from the verb "repertorier," meaning "to record in an index." The original sense was a list of plays or songs available to a theater or musical group.
