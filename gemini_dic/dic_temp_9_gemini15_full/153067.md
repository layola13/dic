例句：His talent as a musician is peerlessly exceptional. 他作为音乐家的天赋是无与伦比的。


近义词：matchlessly, incomparably, unsurpassably, supremely, uniquely

反义词：commonly, ordinarily, mediocrely


词源：源自"peer" (同等的人，贵族) + "-less" (无) + "-ly" (副词后缀).  Originally implying "without equals among peers," it evolved to mean "without equals" in general.  The "-less" suffix indicates the absence of peers, signifying unmatched excellence.
