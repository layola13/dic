词源:

The word "nondoctrinal" is a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "doctrinal" (relating to doctrine).  "Doctrine" comes from the Latin word *doctrina*, meaning "teaching" or "instruction," ultimately derived from *docēre*, meaning "to teach."  Therefore, "nondoctrinal" literally means "not pertaining to teaching or established beliefs."
