词源：
The word "counterfactually" is derived from the prefix "counter-" meaning "against" or "opposite," the adjective "factual," meaning "based on facts," and the adverbial suffix "-ly."  Therefore, "counterfactually" literally means "in a way that is opposite to the facts" or "contrary to what actually happened."  The root "fact" comes from the Latin "factum," the past participle of "facere," meaning "to do" or "to make."

USAGE->
This word is primarily used as an adverb, and therefore doesn't have tense conjugations like verbs. Its usage depends on the sentence structure where it modifies a verb or clause.
