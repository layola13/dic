词源:

The word "infantical" is derived from the Latin word "infans," meaning "unable to speak," or more broadly, "infant."  The suffix "-ical" denotes "relating to" or "characterized by."  Therefore, "infantical" literally means "relating to or characterized by infancy."  Over time, the meaning shifted to emphasize the negative aspects of infant-like behavior in adults.
