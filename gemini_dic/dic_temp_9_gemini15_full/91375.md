词源:
The word "hydrosulphite" is a combination of "hydro-" (referring to hydrogen or water) and "sulphite" (referring to the sulfite ion, SO32−).  The "hydro-" prefix suggests a connection to hydrogen, although the exact chemical structure is more complex than a simple hydrogen addition to sulfite.  The term reflects the historical understanding and preparation methods, even if the precise chemical formulation has evolved.
