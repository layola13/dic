self-friction:/ˌsɛlfˈfrɪkʃən/| n.| 自摩擦；内摩擦 |The resistance to motion caused by the rubbing of one part of a surface against another part of the same surface.  It's often associated with internal forces within a system, rather than external forces.  |例句：The self-friction in the engine caused overheating. 引擎内部的摩擦导致过热。


例句： Excessive self-friction within the mechanism led to premature wear. 机制内部的过度自摩擦导致了过早磨损。|近义词：internal friction, internal resistance|反义词：external friction, lubrication|词性：名词


USAGE->
