词源:
Comes from the Old French word "confession," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "confessio," meaning "acknowledgment," "avowal," or "admission."  The Latin word is formed from the verb "confiteri," meaning "to confess," which itself is a combination of "com-" (together) and "fateri" (to say, to speak).  Therefore, the root meaning points to openly stating or acknowledging something.
