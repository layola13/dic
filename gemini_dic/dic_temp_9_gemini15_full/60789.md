electromigration:/ɪˌlɛktrəʊmaɪˈɡreɪʃən/| n. |电子迁移|The movement of ions in a conductor due to the momentum transfer between conducting electrons and diffusing metal atoms.|例句：Electromigration is a significant reliability concern in integrated circuits. 电子迁移是集成电路中一个重要的可靠性问题。

例句：Excessive current density can lead to electromigration and eventual failure of the interconnect. 过大的电流密度会导致电子迁移，最终导致互连失效。|近义词：ion migration, atomic migration|反义词：N/A

USAGE->
一般现在时:
Electromigration occurs in conductors. = 电子迁移发生在导体中。
The current density affects electromigration. = 电流密度影响电子迁移。


一般过去时:
