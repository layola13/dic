词源:

The word "inauspiciously" is derived from the Latin word "auspex," which means "bird watcher" or "soothsayer." In ancient Rome, augurs (religious officials) observed the flight of birds to predict the future.  A favorable omen was considered "auspicious," while an unfavorable one was "inauspicious."  The prefix "in-" negates the word, resulting in "inauspicious," meaning "not auspicious."  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb.
