词源:

The word is a compound of "half" and "deprecating."

* **half:**  This is a straightforward word meaning "one of two equal parts."

* **deprecating:** This word comes from the verb "deprecate," which ultimately derives from the Latin "deprecari," meaning "to pray against," "to avert by prayer," or "to beg off."  Over time, its meaning shifted to "to express disapproval of," "to belittle," or "to depreciate."  The "-ing" suffix turns it into a present participle, often used adjectivally.  Therefore, "deprecating" describes an action of expressing disapproval or belittling.

The combination "half-deprecating" thus indicates a less-than-full, or somewhat muted, expression of disapproval or self-deprecation, often laced with humor or irony.
