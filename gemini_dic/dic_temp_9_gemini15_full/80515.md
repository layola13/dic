The term can carry positive connotations, evoking a sense of camaraderie and loyalty, but it is more often used with negative connotations, suggesting cronyism, corruption, and resistance to change.  The term often implies a system of privilege and influence based on social connections rather than merit. |例句：He's a good-ole-boy who got the job through his connections, not his qualifications. 他是个靠关系而不是靠资格得到这份工作的老乡。
