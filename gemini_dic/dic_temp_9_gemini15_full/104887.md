词源:

The word "keeper" originates from the Old English word "cēpere," meaning "one who keeps."  This further traces back to the Proto-Germanic root "*keupōn," with similar meanings related to keeping, guarding, and preserving.  The modern English word retains this core meaning of "one who maintains or protects something."
