evolvability:/ˌiːvɒlvəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可进化性，进化能力 | The capacity of a system (typically a biological population or a designed system) to undergo evolutionary change.  It encompasses the ability to generate heritable phenotypic variation and the ability for natural selection to act on that variation.  Evolvability is not simply the rate of evolution, but rather the potential for adaptation. | Example:  The high evolvability of viruses makes them difficult to control.  病毒的高度可进化性使其难以控制。  The researchers investigated the evolvability of different bacterial strains. 研究人员调查了不同细菌菌株的可进化性。 | 近义词：adaptability,  adaptiveness, plasticity | 反义词：inertness, rigidity

It is desirable that the evolvability of this system be improved.  = 理想情况下，这个系统的可进化性应该得到提高。


被动语态:
The evolvability of the system was measured using various methods. = 该系统的可进化性是使用各种方法测量的。

疑问句:
What factors influence the evolvability of a population? = 什么因素会影响种群的可进化性？
How can we measure the evolvability of a complex system? = 我们如何测量复杂系统的可进化性？


否定句:
The lack of genetic diversity did not reduce the evolvability of the species. = 缺乏遗传多样性并没有降低该物种的可进化性。
The study did not find a significant correlation between evolvability and lifespan. = 该研究未发现可进化性和寿命之间存在显著的相关性。


PHRASE->
high evolvability 高可进化性

词源:
The word "evolvability" is a relatively modern term, formed by combining "evolution" and the suffix "-ability," indicating capacity or potential.  "Evolution" itself comes from the Latin word "evolvere," meaning "to unroll" or "to unfold."  Therefore, evolvability implies the capacity for a system to "unfold" or change over time through evolutionary processes.
