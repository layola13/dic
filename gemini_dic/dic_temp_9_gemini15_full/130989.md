USAGE->
This word is an adverb, and therefore doesn't conjugate like verbs.  There is no "past tense" or "future tense" of an adverb.  The usage is always the same.  Examples focus on showing the contrast with "atomically".


Example 1:
The transaction was performed atomically; all changes were made at once or not at all. = 事务是原子执行的；所有更改都是一次性完成的，否则完全不进行更改。

Example 2:
In contrast, the data was updated nonatomically, with the risk of incomplete changes. = 相比之下，数据是非原子更新的，存在更改不完整的风险。


Example 3 (Illustrating a potential consequence):
If the operation were atomic, the data would be consistent.  Because it was nonatomically, data corruption occurred. = 如果操作是原子的，数据将保持一致。由于它是非原子的，因此发生了数据损坏。

Example 4 (Illustrating a scenario):
Many database operations require atomic updates to maintain data integrity.  However, for performance reasons, some systems might use nonatomic updates. =许多数据库操作需要原子更新来维护数据完整性。但是，出于性能原因，某些系统可能会使用非原子更新。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "nonatomically".  The word is used in technical contexts to describe a specific characteristic of operations, primarily in computing and database management.
