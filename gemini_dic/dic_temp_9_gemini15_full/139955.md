英文解析：The odontoid process, also known as the dens, is a tooth-like projection from the superior aspect of the axis (the second cervical vertebra). This projection articulates with the atlas (the first cervical vertebra), allowing for the rotation of the head.  Damage to the odontoid process can result in instability of the neck and potentially serious injury.
