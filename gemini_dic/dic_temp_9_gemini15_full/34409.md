词源:
The word "clatter" originated in the Middle English word "clatren," which is of imitative origin, meaning it's a word formed to sound like the noise it describes.  This is typical of onomatopoeic words.  The sound is thought to reflect the repeated, sharp sounds of hard objects hitting each other.
