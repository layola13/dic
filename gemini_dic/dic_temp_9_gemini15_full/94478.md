imporosity: /ˌɪmpɔːrˈɒsɪti/ | n. | 非孔隙性，致密性 | The lack of pores or spaces in a material.  Imporosity refers to the state of being impervious to fluids, lacking voids or channels.  It is the opposite of porosity. | Example: The imporosity of the granite made it an ideal material for building dams.  花岗岩的致密性使其成为建造水坝的理想材料。| 近义词: compactness, density, imperviousness | 反义词: porosity, permeability |  词性: 名词
