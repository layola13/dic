electromagnet:/ɪˌlɛkˈtroʊˌmæɡnɪt/| n. |电磁铁|An electromagnet is a temporary magnet created by passing an electric current through a coil of wire wound around a core of ferromagnetic material.  The magnetic field is produced by the flow of electricity and disappears when the current is switched off.|Example: The crane used a powerful electromagnet to lift the scrap metal. 起重机用强大的电磁铁来吊起废金属。

The electromagnet in the MRI machine produced a strong magnetic field.  核磁共振成像机的电磁铁产生了一个强大的磁场。|近义词：magnet (in some contexts)|反义词：permanent magnet|名词

词源:
The word "electromagnet" is a compound word formed from "electro" (relating to electricity) and "magnet" (a material that attracts iron).  The "electro" part comes from the Greek word "elektron," meaning amber (a substance that exhibits static electricity when rubbed). The "magnet" part originates from Magnesia, a region in ancient Greece where naturally occurring magnetic stones (lodestones) were found.
