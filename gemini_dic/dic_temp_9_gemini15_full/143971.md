词源：
The word "outrage" ultimately derives from the Old French word *outrager*, meaning "to do violence to," "to wrong," or "to insult."  This, in turn, is from the prefix *out-* (meaning "beyond," "over," or "completely") and the verb *rager*, meaning "to rage" or "to be furious."  Thus, the original meaning involved going beyond the bounds of acceptable behavior and causing fury or violence.
