词源:

The word "openmindedness" is a compound word formed from "open-minded" + "-ness".  "Open-minded" itself combines "open" (meaning receptive to new ideas) and "minded" (referring to one's disposition or attitude).  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "open-minded" into a noun, signifying the quality or state of being open-minded.  The root "open" has Germanic origins, while "-ness" is a common English suffix.
