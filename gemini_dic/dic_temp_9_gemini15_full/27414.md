The word "camerawork" is a compound word formed from "camera" and "work".  "Camera" originates from the Latin word "camera obscura," meaning "dark chamber," referring to the early device that projected images. "Work" comes from the Old English word "wyrc," meaning "to make, perform, or achieve."  Therefore, "camerawork" literally means the work done with a camera.
