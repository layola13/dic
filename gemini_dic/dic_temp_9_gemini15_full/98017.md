词源:

The word "inopportuneness" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), "opportune" (meaning "suitable or convenient in time"), and the suffix "-ness" (forming nouns of state or quality).  "Opportune" itself has roots in Late Latin "opportunus," combining "ob" (towards) and "portus" (harbor, opportunity). Thus, "inopportuneness" literally means "the state of not being at a suitable time or opportunity."
