词源:
The word "disenfranchisement" comes from the Old French word "franche," meaning "free," and ultimately from the Frankish (a Germanic tribe) word "frank,"  meaning "free." The prefix "dis-" means "to deprive of," and the suffix "-ment" indicates a state or condition.  Therefore, "disenfranchisement" literally means "the state of being deprived of freedom" or, more specifically, "the state of being deprived of a right, especially the right to vote."
