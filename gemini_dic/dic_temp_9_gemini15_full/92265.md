词源:
The word "hypervigilance" is a combination of "hyper-" (meaning excessive or above normal) and "vigilance" (meaning the action or state of keeping careful watch for possible danger or difficulties).  "Vigilance" itself comes from the Latin word "vigilare," meaning "to keep awake" or "to watch."
