词源:
The word "gadding" ultimately derives from the Old English word "gad," meaning "a pointed stick or rod," or "a goad."  Its meaning evolved to refer to something that stimulates or provokes movement, leading to its use in describing a lively or restless movement from place to place.  The verb form "to gad" (meaning to wander idly) emerged later, and "gadding" is its gerund/present participle form.
