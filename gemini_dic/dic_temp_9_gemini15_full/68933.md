USAGE->
This word is grammatically unusual and rarely used.  The possessive form "'s" is applied to an already abstract noun, making it cumbersome and generally avoided in formal writing.  Therefore, providing example sentences for various tenses is impractical and unnatural.  The word "fatalness" itself would be used in standard tenses like this:

一般现在时:
The fatalness of the virus is concerning. = 病毒的致命性令人担忧。
His fatalness is evident in his actions. = 他行为中的致命性是显而易见的。


一般过去时:
The fatalness of the decision was underestimated. = 当时的决定有多致命被低估了。
We recognized the fatalness of the situation. = 我们意识到了情况的致命性。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "fatalness's".  The word itself is infrequent, and its possessive form even more so.  Phrases would typically use "fatalness" directly or related words like "deadliness," "lethality," or "severity."
