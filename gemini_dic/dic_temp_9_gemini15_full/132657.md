词源:

The word is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "disingenuous."  "Disingenuous" itself comes from the Latin "dis-" (meaning "apart, away, not") + "ingeniosus" (meaning "clever, ingenious, skillful").  Therefore, "nondisingenuous" literally means "not not-clever" or "not lacking in sincerity".  The shift in meaning from "clever" to "sincere" occurred over time, as "ingenious" came to imply cunning or craftiness, which is the opposite of sincerity.


用法说明:

"Nondisingenuous" is used to describe someone or something that is free from deceit or pretense. It emphasizes sincerity and honesty.  It's a relatively uncommon word, often used in formal contexts to highlight the genuine nature of something.  While "honest" or "sincere" might suffice in most situations, "nondisingenuous" carries a stronger implication of overcoming potential deception or artifice.
