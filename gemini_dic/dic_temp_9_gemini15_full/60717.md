electro-oculography:/ˌɪˌlɛktroʊˌɒkjuˈlɒɡrəfi/|/n.| 眼动图描记术 |The technique of recording eye movements using electrodes.  It measures the corneo-retinal potential, which is the electrical potential difference between the cornea and the retina. This potential difference changes as the eyes move, and these changes are detected by the electrodes and recorded as an electro-oculogram (EOG).  | Example: Electro-oculography is a valuable tool in the diagnosis of neurological disorders. 眼动图描记术是诊断神经系统疾病的宝贵工具。 |近义词：EOG (electro-oculogram) |反义词：无

PHRASE->
electro-oculography recording 眼动图描记记录
electro-oculography signal 眼动图描记信号
electro-oculography system 眼动图描记系统
electro-oculography technique 眼动图描记技术
electro-oculography study 眼动图描记研究

词源:
electro-  (来自希腊语 elektron, 琥珀，指电)
ocu- (来自拉丁语 oculus, 眼睛)
-graphy (来自希腊语 graphia, 书写，记录)

因此，electro-oculography 字面意思是“眼睛的电记录”。
