词源:

* **semi-**:  Prefix meaning "half" or "partly".  源自拉丁语，意为“半”或“部分”。
* **dia-**: Prefix meaning "through" or "across". 源自希腊语，意为“穿过”或“穿过”。
* **phanous**: From Greek *phainein*, meaning "to show" or "to appear". 源自希腊语 *phainein*，意为“显示”或“出现”。  This root is related to words like "phantom" and "phenomenon".


用法说明:

Semidiaphanous is primarily used as an adjective to describe materials that allow some light to pass through but not enough to see clearly through them.  It suggests a degree of transparency less than "diaphanous" but more than "opaque".  The word is relatively uncommon in everyday speech but is frequently used in descriptive writing, particularly when discussing fabrics or natural phenomena.
