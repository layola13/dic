词源:

The word "preconception" is formed from the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the noun "conception," which comes from the Latin word "conceptio," meaning "a taking up," "a receiving," or "a conceiving."  Therefore, "preconception" literally means "a conception formed beforehand."  "Preconvictions" functions similarly, emphasizing the firmness of these prior beliefs, often implying a stronger, more entrenched viewpoint than simply a "preconception".
