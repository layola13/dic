self-precipitations:/ˌsɛlfˌprɪˌsɪpɪˈteɪʃənz/| n. |自沉淀，自析出 |The spontaneous separation of a substance from a solution or suspension.  This process typically involves a change in physical state, often from a dissolved or suspended state to a solid state.  Self-precipitations are common in various chemical and physical processes. |例句：The formation of crystals in a supersaturated solution is an example of self-precipitation.  过饱和溶液中晶体的形成是自沉淀的一个例子。


The rapid self-precipitations of the pollutants led to an unexpected environmental disaster.  污染物的快速自沉淀导致了意想不到的环境灾难。|近义词：autoprecipitation, spontaneous separation |反义词：dissolution, suspension
