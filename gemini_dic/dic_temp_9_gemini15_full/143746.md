词源:
The word "outmaneuver" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "to a greater degree than") and the verb "maneuver," which ultimately derives from the French word "manoeuvre," meaning "to handle," "to work," or "to use skillfully."  The French word in turn comes from the Old French "manoevre," and ultimately from the late Latin "manopera," a combination of "manus" (hand) and "opera" (work).  Therefore, the core meaning of "outmaneuver" relates to skillful handling and strategic movement.
