词源:
The phrase "out of the box" originates from the game of thinking outside of the literal box.  It started gaining popularity in the late 20th century, referring to thinking creatively and unconventionally, moving beyond the limitations of established norms and procedures.  While a precise etymological origin is difficult to pinpoint, its usage reflects the metaphorical extension of the physical constraint of a box to the mental constraints of conventional thinking.
