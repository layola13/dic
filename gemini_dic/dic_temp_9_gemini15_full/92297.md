hypidiomorphic:/ˌhaɪpiːdiːoʊˈmɔːrfɪk/| adj.|次同形晶质的；准自形晶的|Relating to or denoting rocks or minerals in which the crystals are partly euhedral (well-formed) and partly anhedral (poorly formed or irregular).  This texture results from a balance between the rate of crystal growth and the availability of space.  The crystals show a tendency towards complete crystal faces but are often interfered with by neighboring crystals, resulting in a mixture of euhedral and anhedral forms.|The igneous rock displayed a hypidiomorphic texture, with some crystals exhibiting well-defined faces while others were irregular in shape.|近义词：subhedral|反义词：euhedral, anhedral


USAGE->
There is no common usage of "hypidiomorphic" in everyday conversation or standard grammatical structures as it is a geological term. The word is used descriptively within the context of petrology (the study of rocks) and mineralogy.  Therefore, examples of usage will be limited to its scientific application.

Example 1 (Descriptive):
The thin section revealed a hypidiomorphic granular texture, indicating relatively slow cooling. = 薄片显示出次同形晶粒结构，表明冷却速度相对较慢。

Example 2 (Comparative):
Unlike the euhedral texture of sample A, sample B exhibited a hypidiomorphic texture, suggesting different crystallization conditions. = 与样品A的完全自形晶结构不同，样品B呈现次同形晶结构，这表明结晶条件不同。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases that include "hypidiomorphic".  The term is used solely within its specific scientific field.
