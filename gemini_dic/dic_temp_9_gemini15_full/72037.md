词源:  Derived from the word "flip," which originally meant to snap or flick something.  The sense of  "light-hearted" or "superficial" developed later, leading to the adjective "flippant" and ultimately "flippest."  The evolution suggests a connection to the quick, almost careless action of flipping something.
