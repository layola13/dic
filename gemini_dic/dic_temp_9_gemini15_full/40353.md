contractility:/ˌkɒntrækˈtɪləti/|/ˌkɑːntrækˈtɪləti/| n. |收缩性，肌力|The inherent ability of a muscle or other tissue to shorten or contract.  This property is essential for movement, both voluntary and involuntary.  It is influenced by factors such as muscle fiber type, length, and neurological stimulation.|例句：The contractility of the heart muscle is crucial for maintaining blood circulation. 心肌的收缩性对于维持血液循环至关重要。|例句：Reduced contractility can be a symptom of heart failure. 收缩性降低可能是心力衰竭的症状。|近义词：contraction, tension, responsiveness|反义词：flaccidity, relaxation
