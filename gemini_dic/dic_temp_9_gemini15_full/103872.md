词源:
The word "jubilancies" is derived from the noun "jubilee," which ultimately comes from the Hebrew word "yobel" (יוֹבֵל), meaning "ram's horn."  In the Old Testament, the Jubilee was a period of remission and release, celebrated every 50 years.  Over time, "jubilee" came to refer to any time of celebration or rejoicing, and "jubilancies" is the plural form, referring to multiple instances of such joy.
