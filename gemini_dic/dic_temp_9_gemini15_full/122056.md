词源:
The word "mistakingly" derives from the adjective "mistaken," which in turn comes from the verb "mistake."  "Mistake" itself has Old English roots, combining the prefix "mis-" (meaning "wrongly" or "badly") with "take," meaning "to grasp, understand, or perceive."  Therefore, "mistakingly" signifies an action performed with a wrong understanding or perception.
