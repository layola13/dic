The word "mwini" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a word from another language, possibly Swahili.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown in the requested format is impossible without knowing its origin and meaning in that language.  To provide the requested information, I need the language of origin.
