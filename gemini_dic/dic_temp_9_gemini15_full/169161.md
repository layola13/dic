Prolepsis can also refer to a rhetorical device where a future event is described as if it has already occurred. | Example:  "The ship, destined to sink, sailed bravely on." (The sinking is mentioned before it happens, creating dramatic irony.) | 近义词: anticipation, prefiguration, foreshadowing | 反义词: retrospection, postdiction
