词源:
The word "looney" is a slang term derived from the word "lunatic," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "luna," meaning "moon."  The belief that the moon influenced mental illness led to the association of lunacy with madness.  Over time, "lunatic" was shortened and altered, becoming "looney."
