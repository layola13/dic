词源:
The word "retracement" comes from the verb "retrace," which combines the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") with the verb "trace" (meaning "to follow the course or path of").  Therefore, "retracement" literally means "the act of tracing back" or "a return to a previous point."  Its use in finance specifically refers to the return of a price to a previous level.
