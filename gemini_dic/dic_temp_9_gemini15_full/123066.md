词源:
The word "money-lender" is a compound word formed from "money" and "lender".  "Money" originates from Old French "moine", referring to coins, and ultimately from Latin "moneta", a nickname for Juno, the Roman goddess of finance. "Lender" comes from the Old English "lǣnan", meaning "to lend".  Therefore, "money-lender" literally means "one who lends money".
