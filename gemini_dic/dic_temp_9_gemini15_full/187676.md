词源：The word "rook" comes from the Old English word "hrōc," which referred to a type of crow. Its use in chess is derived from the appearance of the chess piece, which resembles a castle or tower.  The sense of "beginner" or "inexperienced person" developed later, likely from the association of rooks in chess being easily captured early in the game.
