词源：The word "ditzy" likely originated as a variant of "dizzy,"  but its specific etymological path is uncertain. The shift in meaning from "dizzy" (feeling faint or unsteady) to "ditzy" (scatterbrained and flighty) reflects a semantic broadening and a change in connotation. The "-y" suffix adds a diminutive or informal quality.
