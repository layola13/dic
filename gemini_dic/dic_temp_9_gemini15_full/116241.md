词源：The word is a compound of "mass," referring to a large quantity or number, and "marketed," the past participle of "market," meaning to promote and sell goods or services. The "mass" element indicates a large target audience, while "marketed" shows the commercial aspect of reaching that audience.  The term evolved with the growth of mass production and consumerism in the 20th century.
