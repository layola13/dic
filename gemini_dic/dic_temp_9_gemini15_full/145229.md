词源:

The word "overbias" is a combination of "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much") and "bias" (meaning "a particular tendency, trend, inclination, feeling, or opinion, especially one that is preconceived or unreasoned").  Therefore, "overbias" literally means "excessive bias."  It's a relatively straightforward construction of existing English words.
