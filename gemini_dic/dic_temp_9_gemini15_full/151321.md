The word "parishen" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  To get a helpful response, please double-check the spelling of the word.
