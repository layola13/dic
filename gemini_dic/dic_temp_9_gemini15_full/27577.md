词源:
The word "canape" comes from the French word "canapé," meaning "sofa" or "couch."  The culinary meaning likely arose from the association of small, easily-held snacks being presented in a similar manner to items placed on a couch for comfort and convenience.  The French word itself is of uncertain origin, possibly from the Old French "canapée," though the exact etymology is debated.
