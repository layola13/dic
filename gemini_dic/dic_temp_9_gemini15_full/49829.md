词源:

The word "demonstrative" originates from the Latin word "demonstrativus," which is derived from "demonstrare," meaning "to show," "to point out," or "to prove."  The prefix "de-" indicates "away" or "down," and "monstrare" is related to "monstrum," meaning "omen" or "warning."  The original sense thus involved showing or exhibiting something clearly, often to make a point or provide proof.


用法说明：

As an adjective, "demonstrative" has two main senses:

1. **Expressing feelings openly:** This is the more common usage in everyday conversation.  It describes someone who readily and openly displays their emotions, often through physical affection or verbal expression.

2. **Serving as proof or evidence:** This usage is more common in formal contexts like scientific writing or legal arguments.  It describes something that clearly shows or proves a point.
