词源:

* **combustible:**  This is the root word. It comes from the Latin "combustibilis," meaning "capable of being burned."  This, in turn, is derived from "combūrere," meaning "to burn completely."

* **-ness:** This suffix is added to adjectives to form nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.  For example, "goodness," "sadness," "darkness."

* **-es:** This is the plural suffix added to the noun "combustibleness."  Because "combustibleness" is already a noun ending in -s, it's not uncommon to see the plural form "combustiblenesses" used when referring to multiple types or aspects of combustibility.


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a technical context, particularly in fields like materials science, chemistry, and fire safety.  Because it is the plural form of a noun already ending in -s, its usage in everyday conversation is extremely rare.  Grammatical usage would follow standard noun rules.


例句：
The study compared the combustiblenesses of various fuels. 这项研究比较了各种燃料的可燃性。

The report detailed the combustiblenesses of different types of wood. 报告详细说明了不同类型木材的可燃性。
