nonmetaphoric:/ˌnɒnˌmɛtəˈfɒrɪk/ | adj. | 非比喻的，字面意义的 |  Literal; not using metaphors or figurative language.  The description of the event was entirely nonmetaphoric, sticking strictly to the facts.  | 近义词：literal, figurative, prosaic | 反义词：metaphorical, figurative


The word "nonmetaphoric" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "metaphoric" (relating to or characterized by metaphor).  The root of "metaphor" comes from the Greek word "metaphora,"  meaning "to transfer" or "to carry over."  This reflects the core function of a metaphor: transferring meaning from one concept to another for illustrative effect.
