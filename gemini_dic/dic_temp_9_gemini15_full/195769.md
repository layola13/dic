USAGE->

一般现在时:
The island is formed semivolcanically. = 这个岛屿是半火山形成的。
This rock formation appears semivolcanically created. = 这个岩层看起来是部分由火山活动形成的。


一般过去时:
The geologists believed the area was formed semivolcanically. = 地质学家认为该地区是半火山形成的。
The evidence suggested the landscape was semivolcanically shaped in the past. = 证据表明，过去的地貌是部分由火山活动塑造的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have determined that the region has been shaped semivolcanically over millions of years. = 科学家已经确定该地区经过数百万年的半火山活动而形成。
Researchers have concluded that the mountain range has developed semivolcanically. = 研究人员得出结论，山脉是半火山形成的。


过去完成时:
Before the detailed analysis, they had assumed the formation was entirely semivolcanically produced. = 在详细分析之前，他们曾假设该地层完全是由半火山活动产生的。
Geologists had initially believed the process was purely volcanic, but later found it semivolcanically influenced. = 地质学家最初认为这个过程完全是火山作用，但后来发现它受到了半火山活动的影响。


将来时:
Further research will reveal if the formation was truly semivolcanically created. = 进一步的研究将揭示该地层是否真的是半火山形成的。
They will determine whether the land was formed primarily volcanically or semivolcanically. = 他们将确定这片土地是主要由火山活动还是半火山活动形成的。


虚拟语气:
If the process were purely semivolcanically driven, we would expect to see different geological features. = 如果该过程完全是由半火山活动驱动的，我们会期望看到不同的地质特征。
I wish we had more data to confirm if the formation is semivolcanically influenced. = 我希望我们有更多的数据来证实该地层是否受到半火山活动的影响。


被动语态:
The geological features were believed to have been formed semivolcanically. = 人们认为这些地质特征是半火山形成的。
The origin of the rock formations is thought to have been semivolcanically influenced. = 人们认为岩层的起源受到了半火山活动的影响。


疑问句:
Was the island formed entirely volcanically or semivolcanically? = 这个岛屿是完全由火山活动形成的还是部分由火山活动形成的？
Is this geological structure primarily volcanic or semivolcanically derived? = 这种地质结构是主要由火山活动形成的还是部分由火山活动形成的？


否定句:
The rock formation was not entirely semivolcanically produced; other forces were also at play. = 该岩层并非完全由半火山活动形成；其他力量也在起作用。
The landscape was not formed solely semivolcanically; tectonic activity also played a role. = 这片地貌并非仅仅由半火山活动形成；构造活动也发挥了作用。
