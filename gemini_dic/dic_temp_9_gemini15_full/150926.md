词源:

The word "parallelogrammic" is derived from the noun "parallelogram."  "Parallelogram" itself is a combination of:

* **parallel:** from the Greek *παράλληλος* (parállēlos), meaning "beside one another," from *παρά* (pará), "beside" + *ἀλλήλων* (allēlōn), "one another."

* **gram:** from the Greek *γραμμή* (grammē), meaning "line."


Therefore, "parallelogram" literally means "a figure with parallel lines," and "parallelogrammic" describes something related to or possessing the qualities of such a figure.
