cocatalysts: /ˌkoʊˈkætəlɪsts/ | n. | 催化剂 | A substance that enhances the activity of a catalyst but is not itself consumed in the catalytic process. Cocatalysts often play a crucial role in facilitating the interaction between the catalyst and the reactants, thereby improving the efficiency or selectivity of the catalytic reaction.  | Example: In some polymerization reactions, a cocatalyst is used to activate the main catalyst and increase the reaction rate.  在一些聚合反应中，使用助催化剂来活化主催化剂并提高反应速率。 | 近义词: activator, promoter | 反义词: inhibitor
