词源:

The word "cruder" is the comparative form of the adjective "crude."  "Crude" ultimately derives from the Old French word "crud," meaning "raw," which in turn comes from the Latin word "crudus," also meaning "raw," "unripe," or "undigested."  The sense of "unrefined" or "vulgar" developed later.
