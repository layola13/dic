词源：

The word "nonconvivial" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "convivial."  "Convivial" comes from the Latin word "convivium," meaning "a feast, a banquet,"  ultimately deriving from "con-" (together) and "vivere" (to live).  Thus, "convivial" originally referred to the lively and sociable atmosphere of a feast, and "nonconvivial" is its antonym, signifying the lack of such an atmosphere.


用法说明：

"Nonconvivial" is used to describe situations, atmospheres, or people that lack friendliness, warmth, and sociability. It suggests a cold, unfriendly, or even hostile environment or interaction.  It's a more formal word than simply saying "unfriendly."
