词源:
The word "hippogriff" is a blend of "hippo" (horse) and "griffin" (a creature with the head and wings of an eagle and the body of a lion).  It was coined by the Italian poet Ludovico Ariosto in his epic poem *Orlando Furioso* (1516).  The creature itself draws on older mythological traditions of hybrid creatures with avian and equine characteristics.
