词源:
The word "faery" is a variant spelling of "fairy," which ultimately derives from Old French *faerie, meaning "fairyland, enchantment."  The Old French word itself comes from the Latin word *fata, meaning "fate" or "destiny," ultimately connected to the Latin verb *fari, "to speak." The connection lies in the belief that fairies had the power to influence fate or destiny through their actions and magic.  The spelling "faery" is an older, more archaic spelling that emphasizes the connection to "fairyland" and the magical, enchanted quality associated with fairies.
