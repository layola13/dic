词源：

Derived from "prestige" + "-atory" (suffix indicating relating to or characterized by).  "Prestige" itself originates from the Latin word "praestīgĭā," meaning "illusion," "trick," or "deception," ultimately relating to the  idea of creating an impressive or awe-inspiring effect, often through illusion or skillful deception.  The shift in meaning from deception to high status occurred over time.
