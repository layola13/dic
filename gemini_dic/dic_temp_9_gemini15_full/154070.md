pericambium: /ˌpɛriˈkæmbiəm/ | n. | 围鞘，髓鞘 | The pericambium is a sheath of cells surrounding the vascular bundles in certain plants, particularly ferns and lycophytes.  It plays a role in the growth and development of the vascular tissue.  | Example: The pericambium actively contributes to the formation of new vascular tissues.  围鞘积极参与新的维管组织的形成。 | 近义词:  (There aren't direct synonyms, as the term is quite specific.) | 反义词: (No direct antonyms exist.) |  名词
