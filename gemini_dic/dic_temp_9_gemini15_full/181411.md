reiterable:/ˌriːɪˈtərəbl/| adj.| 可重复迭代的，可再次迭代的 | Able to be iterated over again; capable of being repeated in an iterative process.  This term is primarily used in the context of programming and data structures.  It implies that a data structure or process can be traversed multiple times without needing to be rebuilt or reset. | Example: "The linked list is reiterable, allowing for efficient multiple traversals." = “这个链表是可重复迭代的，允许高效的多次遍历。” |近义词: repeatable, iterative |反义词: non-iterable, one-time


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The data structure is reiterable. = 数据结构是可重复迭代的。
This function is reiterable; we can call it many times. = 这个函数是可重复迭代的；我们可以多次调用它。


一般过去时:
The array was reiterable. = 数组是可重复迭代的。
The process was reiterable, allowing for multiple runs. = 这个过程是可重复迭代的，允许多次运行。


现在完成时:
The program has been reiterable throughout the testing phase. = 在整个测试阶段，程序都是可重复迭代的。
The data set has proven reiterable for our analysis. = 数据集已被证明对我们的分析是可重复迭代的。


过去完成时:
The algorithm had been reiterable, so we ran it several times. = 该算法是可重复迭代的，所以我们运行了几次。
The system had been reiterable prior to the update. = 系统在更新之前是可重复迭代的。


将来时:
The list will be reiterable after the modification. = 修改后列表将是可重复迭代的。
The loop will be reiterable for the next iteration of data. = 循环将对下一批数据进行可重复迭代。


虚拟语气:
If the data were reiterable, the analysis would be much simpler. = 如果数据是可重复迭代的，分析将会简单得多。
I wish the generator were reiterable; it would save considerable time. = 我希望生成器是可重复迭代的；这将节省大量时间。


被动语态:
The list is being iterated over reiterably. = 列表正在被重复迭代。
The data is being processed reiterably by the system. = 数据正在被系统重复迭代地处理。


疑问句:
Is this data structure reiterable? = 这个数据结构是可重复迭代的吗？
Is the process reiterable for multiple inputs? = 该过程对于多个输入是否可重复迭代？


否定句:
The data is not reiterable after modification. = 修改后数据不可重复迭代。
That function is not reiterable; it can only be called once. = 那个函数不可重复迭代；它只能调用一次。



PHRASE->
(There are few common phrases directly using "reiterable." The usage is mostly technical.)  The word itself is usually used directly in technical documentation or code comments.  Instead of phrases, examples of how it's used are more relevant.

Example 1:  "Ensure the reiterable nature of the data stream." = "确保数据流的可重复迭代性。"
Example 2: "The algorithm maintains a reiterable state." = "该算法保持可重复迭代的状态。"
Example 3: "Reiterable data structures are preferred for this task." = "对于这项任务，首选可重复迭代的数据结构。"
Example 4: "The function returns a reiterable object." = "该函数返回一个可重复迭代的对象。"
Example 5: "Implement a reiterable data structure for efficient processing." = "实现一个可重复迭代的数据结构以进行高效处理。"
