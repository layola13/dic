The word "shet" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of another word.  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "sheet," "shed," "shot," or another word entirely?

2. **It's slang or dialect:** It might be a slang term or a word used in a specific dialect or region, but without more context, it's impossible to define.

3. **It's a newly coined word:**  It's possible it's a very recent invention or neologism.

4. **It's a typographical error:** A simple typing mistake.
