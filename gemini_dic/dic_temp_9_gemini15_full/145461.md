词源:

The word "overcivilizing" is a relatively modern coinage, formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the adjective "civilized."  "Civilized" itself derives from the French "civilisé," ultimately from the Latin "civilis" meaning "civil," "of citizens," or "belonging to a state." The implication of "civilized" shifted over time to denote refinement, politeness, and cultured behavior, a meaning that "overcivilizing" now ironically inverts.
