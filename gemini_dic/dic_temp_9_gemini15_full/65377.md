eunuchs:/ˈjuːnʊks/| n.|太监，阉人|A eunuch is a castrated male human being. Historically, eunuchs often served in palaces and harems, holding positions of power and trust due to their inability to father children and thus pose a threat.  The term can also be used figuratively to describe someone who is powerless or lacking in influence.|Example:  Many eunuchs held significant power in ancient Chinese imperial courts.  许多太监在古代中国皇室朝廷中拥有重要的权力。

The term "eunuch" has historically been associated with the practice of castration and the resulting loss of sexual function and reproductive capacity.  However, the social roles and power dynamics associated with eunuchs varied significantly across different cultures and historical periods. In some societies, eunuchs served as trusted advisors, guards, or administrators, while in others they were marginalized and ostracized. The term also has implications regarding power, authority, and the suppression of sexuality.
