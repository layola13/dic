Etymology: The word "goblet" comes from the Old French word "gobelet," which ultimately derives from the Late Latin word "cuppa," meaning "cup."  The evolution reflects the gradual shift in the shape and style of drinking vessels over time, from simple cups to the more elaborate stemmed goblets we know today.
