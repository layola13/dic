mortmain:/ˈmɔːrtmeɪn/ | n. | 死人掌握；死手；教会财产；不动产的永久性所有权 |  Property held in mortmain is land or other property owned by a corporation (such as a church or a monastery) that cannot be sold or transferred.  The term arises from the historical practice of land being held by religious institutions which, being immortal, could not die and therefore could not transfer the property through inheritance. This practice often prevented the land from being taxed or otherwise used for the benefit of the wider community. | The church held vast tracts of land in mortmain.  教会拥有大片死手土地。

The practice of mortmain was often seen as a problem because it removed land from the normal cycle of inheritance and taxation.  |近义词：dead hand, inalienable possession | 反义词：alienable property, fee simple
