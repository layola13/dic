词源:
The word "expectably" is derived from the adjective "expected," which comes from the verb "expect."  The suffix "-ably" transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner or way in which something happens.  The root "expect" has Latin origins, related to "expectare," meaning "to wait for," "to await."
