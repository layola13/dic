词源:
The word "demidevil" is a compound word.  "Demi-" is a prefix derived from the Old French "demi," meaning "half," ultimately from the Latin "dimidius."  "Devil" comes from the Old English "deofol," related to the Old High German "tiuval," both ultimately tracing back to the Greek "diabolos," meaning "slanderer," or "accuser."  Therefore, "demidevil" literally means "half-devil."


用法说明:
The word "demidevil" is primarily used in literature and fantasy settings to describe a creature or character that possesses some, but not all, of the characteristics of a devil. It is less frequently used to describe a person, but when it is, it implies a high degree of wickedness or cruelty.  The term is often used with a sense of dramatic exaggeration, emphasizing the character's malevolent nature.
