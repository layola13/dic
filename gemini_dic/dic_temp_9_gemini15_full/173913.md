词源:
* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation.
* **righteously**: From "righteous," meaning morally right or justified.  This in turn derives from Old English *rihtwīs*, combining *riht* ("right") and *wīs* ("wise").


USAGE->
This word is an adjective, so it doesn't have verb conjugations like "what" does.  It describes a manner or action.
