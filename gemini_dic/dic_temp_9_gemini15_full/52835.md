词源:  The word is a compound of "dim," meaning "dull" or "not bright," and "witted," meaning "having intelligence or wit."  "Wit" itself comes from Old English *wit, meaning "mind, understanding, sense". The "-ed" suffix transforms the noun "wit" into an adjective describing someone possessing or lacking a certain quality of wit.  Therefore, "dim-witted" literally means "having dull or weak intelligence."
