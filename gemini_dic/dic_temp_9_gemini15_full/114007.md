词源:  The word "magistrature" comes from the Late Latin word *magistratura*, which is a noun derived from the Latin word *magistratus*. *Magistratus* itself combines *magister* ("master," "chief," "magistrate") with the suffix *-tus*, which forms nouns denoting office or status.  Therefore, the root meaning points to the office or authority of a magistrate.  The word's journey into English reflects its historical connection to Roman governance and legal systems.
