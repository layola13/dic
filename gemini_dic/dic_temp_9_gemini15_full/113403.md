The word "lyken" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a word from a very specialized field, or a word from a fictional language.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer a more informed response.
