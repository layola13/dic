词源：

* **impregnability:**  This word is derived from the word "impregnate," which originally meant "to fill completely" or "to make pregnant."  The prefix "im-" means "not," and the root "-pregnable" comes from the Latin "prehendere," meaning "to seize" or "to grasp."  Therefore, "impregnability" literally means "not able to be seized or penetrated."

* **-nesses:** This suffix is a pluralizing suffix, turning the adjective "impregnable" into the noun "impregnablenesses," indicating multiple instances of impregnability.


用法说明：

Impregnablenesses is a relatively uncommon word used to emphasize the multiple aspects or instances of strength, resilience, or resistance to attack or penetration. It's usually used in formal contexts and situations where multiple layers or forms of impregnability are involved.  It's important to note that while grammatically correct, using "impregnabilities" might be preferred in most contexts for its conciseness.


PHRASE->

There are no common phrases specifically using "impregnablenesses." The word itself is used independently to describe the multiple instances of a characteristic, rather than forming part of a set phrase.
