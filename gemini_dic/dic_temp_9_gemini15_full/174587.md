词源：

The word "quirkily" derives from the noun "quirk," meaning an oddity or peculiarity.  The word "quirk" itself has a complex etymology, possibly originating from a Middle English word related to "to twist" or "to writhe."  The development of "quirkily" as an adverbial form reflects the increasing use of "-ly" suffixes to create adverbs from adjectives and nouns.
