orthodromy:/ɔːrˈθɒdrəmi/| n. |最短航线；直线航线；大圆航线 |The shortest distance between two points on a sphere, following a great-circle route.  This is in contrast to a rhumb line, which follows a constant compass bearing.  Orthodromy is frequently used in navigation, particularly for long-distance flights or sea voyages.|例句：The pilot chose an orthodromic route to minimize flight time.  飞行员选择了一条大圆航线以最大限度地减少飞行时间。

The shortest route between two points on a curved surface, such as the Earth, is not a straight line but a great-circle arc. This great-circle route is called an orthodrome. |例句：Calculating an orthodrome requires considering the Earth's curvature. 计算大圆航线需要考虑地球的曲率。


近义词：great-circle route, geodesic, great-circle sailing |反义词：rhumb line, loxodrome
