词源:

The word "numbskull" originates from the Middle English word "numskul,"  combining "numb" (meaning dull or insensible) and "skull" (referring to the head). The implication is a head that is dull or insensitive, hence a stupid person.  The evolution of the word reflects the association between a lack of intelligence and a perceived lack of feeling or sensitivity.
