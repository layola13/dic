词源:
The word "disrespectable" is formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") to the adjective "respectable."  "Respectable" itself comes from the verb "respect," ultimately derived from the Latin word "respectus," meaning "regard," "attention," or "consideration."  Therefore, "disrespectable" literally means "not worthy of respect."
