hydrotropic:/ˌhaɪdrəˈtroʊpɪk/ | adj. | 亲水的，助溶的 |  Relating to or denoting the increase in the solubility of a substance in water by the addition of another substance.  Hydrotropic agents are typically salts of organic acids or bases that enhance the solubility of other compounds in water.  This effect is different from simple dissolution, as it involves interactions beyond the simple solvation of the solute. | 例句：Sodium benzoate is a common hydrotropic agent used in pharmaceutical formulations.  苯甲酸钠是制药配方中常用的助溶剂。

The addition of hydrotropic substances can improve the solubility of poorly soluble drugs. 添加助溶剂可以提高难溶性药物的溶解度。


近义词： solubilizing,  solvent-enhancing | 反义词： hydrophobics


词源:  The word "hydrotropic" is derived from the Greek words "hydro" (ὕδωρ, meaning "water") and "tropos" (τρόπος, meaning "a turn" or "change").  The combination suggests a "water-turning" or "water-altering" effect, referring to the way hydrotropic agents alter the solubility of substances in water.
