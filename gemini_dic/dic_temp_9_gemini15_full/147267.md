词源:

The word "overmilking" is a compound word formed from "over-" (meaning excessively or too much) and "milking" (the act of extracting milk from an animal).  The extension of its meaning beyond the literal act of milking cows reflects the common metaphorical use of "milking" to describe exploiting something for profit or advantage.
