microbarograph:/ˌmaɪkroʊˈbærəɡræf/| n. |微气压计|A microbarograph is a sensitive barometer used to measure very small changes in atmospheric pressure, often used in seismology to detect seismic waves.  It is more sensitive than a standard barometer. |The microbarograph recorded a subtle pressure drop just before the earthquake. 微气压计在地震发生前记录到轻微的压力下降。 |sensitive barometer, precision barometer|insensitive barometer|
