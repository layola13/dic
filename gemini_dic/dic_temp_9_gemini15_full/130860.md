nonarbitrariness:/ˌnɒnɑːrˈbɪtrərɪnəs/| adj. |非任意性，非随意性|The principle that there is no inherent connection between the form of a linguistic sign (e.g., a word) and its meaning.  This contrasts with the idea that the relationship between a word and its meaning is arbitrary or accidental.  For example, there's no inherent reason why the word "cat" represents the furry animal; it's a matter of convention. |The nonarbitrariness of language is a key concept in semiotics and linguistics.  The symbolic relationship between signifier and signified often shows a degree of motivatedness, although this is not always the case. This principle is often challenged by onomatopoeia, where sound imitates meaning. |Near synonyms:  conventionality, motivatedness (in the context of a degree of non-arbitrariness), systematicity |Antonyms: arbitrariness, randomness |
