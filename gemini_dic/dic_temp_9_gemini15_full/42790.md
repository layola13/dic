词源:
The word "coupled" comes from the Middle English word "copulen," which in turn derives from the Old French word "copuler" and ultimately from the Late Latin word "copulare," meaning "to join together" or "to unite."  The root is likely related to the Latin word "copula," meaning "a bond" or "a tie."
