词源:

The word "flimsy" ultimately derives from the Middle Dutch word "vlimmen," meaning "to flicker" or "to flutter." This connection suggests an association with something light and easily moved, hence its association with weakness and fragility.  The "-iest" suffix indicates the superlative degree, signifying the highest degree of flimsiness.
