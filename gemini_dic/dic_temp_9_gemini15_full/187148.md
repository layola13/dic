词源:

The word "roadblocks" is a compound word formed from "road" and "blocks".  "Road" originates from Old English "rōd," meaning "a ridden way." "Blocks" comes from Middle Dutch "bloc," meaning "a piece of wood," later broadened to mean any obstruction.  The combination thus literally means "things blocking a road," and figuratively, anything impeding progress.
