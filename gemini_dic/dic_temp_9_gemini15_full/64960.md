词源:
The word "estheticized" is derived from the word "aesthetic," which comes from the Greek word "aisthetikos," meaning "perceptible to the senses," ultimately from "aisthanesthai," meaning "to perceive." The suffix "-ized" indicates the process of making something or becoming something.  Therefore, "estheticized" means "made to conform to aesthetic principles or standards; made aesthetically pleasing."
