precondensations: /ˌpriːkənˌdɛnˈseɪʃənz/ | n. | 预聚合，预缩合反应 |  The process of partial polymerization or condensation before a final polymerization or condensation reaction.  Precondensations are often used to prepare monomers or oligomers that are then further reacted to form the final polymer.  This process can improve the control over the final polymer's properties and reduce the risk of unwanted side reactions. | The precondensation of phenol and formaldehyde leads to the formation of resoles. 预聚合酚和甲醛导致树脂的形成。


The synthesis of polyesters often involves a precondensation step to control molecular weight. 聚酯的合成通常涉及预聚合步骤以控制分子量。| 近义词：prepolymerization, partial polymerization | 反义词：postcondensation (less common, as it's usually implied by the context) | 名词
