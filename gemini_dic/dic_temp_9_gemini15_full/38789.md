conduction:/kənˈdʌkʃən/ | n. | 传导；传热；传电 | The process by which heat or electricity is directly transmitted through a substance when there is a difference of temperature or of electrical potential between adjoining regions, without movement of the material.  | Example: Heat conduction is responsible for the warming of a metal spoon when placed in a hot cup of tea.  热传导是金属勺子放入热茶杯中变热的原因。


The process of conducting heat, electricity, etc.  | Example:  The electrical conduction in this wire is excellent. 这根电线的导电性极佳。|近义词：transmission, transfer | 反义词：insulation
