词源:
The word "lotion" ultimately derives from the Latin word "lotio," meaning "a washing" or "bathing."  This reflects the original use of lotions as cleansing or washing preparations.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the moisturizing and cosmetic applications we associate with lotions today.
