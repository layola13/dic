USAGE->
This word is extremely rare and unnatural.  It's a contrived noun formed by adding "-ness" (meaning "state or quality of") twice to "periodical."  Native English speakers would almost never use this word.  Therefore, providing examples of its usage in various tenses is impractical and misleading.  The word itself is grammatically correct, but semantically awkward and redundant.  Its meaning is essentially the same as "periodicity" or "regularity of publication."


PHRASE->
Because of the word's rarity, providing common phrases is inappropriate.  The word itself should be avoided in favor of simpler, more natural alternatives.
