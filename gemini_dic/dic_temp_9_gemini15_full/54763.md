词源:
The word "dispatch" comes from the Old French word "despecher," meaning "to hasten" or "to send off quickly."  This ultimately derives from the Latin word "expedire," meaning "to extricate" or "to free." The sense of "sending off" developed from the idea of quickly freeing something or someone from a place or situation.
