词源:
The word "hermit" comes from the Old French word "hermite," which ultimately derives from the Late Latin word "eremita."  This, in turn, is derived from the Greek word "erēmitēs," meaning "dweller in a desert," from "erēmos," meaning "desert, wilderness."  The word's evolution reflects the historical association of hermits with solitary desert living.
