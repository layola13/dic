The word "chade" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Please double-check your spelling.
* **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name (person, place, or thing) not found in general dictionaries.
* **It's slang or jargon:**  It might be used within a specific community or context.
* **It's a newly coined word:** It's possible it's a very recent invention.


If you can provide more context (where you encountered the word, the surrounding text), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
