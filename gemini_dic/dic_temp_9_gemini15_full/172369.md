词源:
The word "putter" likely originated as a frequentative verb (a verb form that emphasizes repetition or continuation of an action) related to the verb "put."  The meaning evolved to describe gentle, repeated actions, and later to encompass the specific act of using a golf club in putting.  The noun sense ("a golf club") followed from this.
