WORD ORIGIN->
The word "deliriousnesses" is derived from the adjective "delirious," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "delirare," meaning "to go out of the furrow" or "to be out of one's mind."  The suffix "-ness" indicates a state or condition, and the further suffix "-es" denotes the plural.  Therefore, "deliriousnesses" signifies multiple instances or types of the state of being delirious.
