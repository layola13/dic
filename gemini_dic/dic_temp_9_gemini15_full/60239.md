词源:
The word "effrontery" comes from the Old French word "effronterie," which itself is derived from "effronté," meaning "shameless" or "bold."  The prefix "ef-" is an alteration of "ex-" (out) and "front" refers to the forehead.  The original sense suggests a boldness so extreme that it reveals a lack of shame or concern for others' opinions.
