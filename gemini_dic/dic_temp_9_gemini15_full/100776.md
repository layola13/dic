词源:
The word "entreat" comes from the Old French word "entraiter," meaning "to treat, to handle," which in turn comes from the Latin word "tractare," meaning "to handle, to treat."  The prefix "en-" in Old French intensified the meaning.  Over time, the meaning shifted to emphasize the earnest pleading aspect.
