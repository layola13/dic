interadditive: /ˌɪntərˈædɪtɪv/ | adj. |交互加成的，相互作用的 |  Describes a process or system where the combined effect of multiple elements is greater than the sum of their individual effects.  This often implies a synergistic relationship, where the interaction between components enhances the overall outcome. | Example: The interadditive effect of the two drugs resulted in a significantly improved therapeutic outcome.  两种药物的交互加成效应导致疗效显著提高。|近义词: synergistic, cumulative, combined | 反义词: antagonistic, subtractive


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The two chemicals have an interadditive effect. = 这两种化学物质具有交互加成效应。
This process shows interadditive properties. = 此过程显示出交互加成特性。


一般过去时:
The experiment demonstrated an interadditive effect. = 实验结果证明了交互加成效应。
The researchers observed an interadditive response. = 研究人员观察到交互加成反应。


现在完成时:
Studies have shown interadditive benefits. = 研究表明具有交互加成益处。
Scientists have confirmed the interadditive nature of the phenomenon. = 科学家证实了该现象的交互加成性质。


过去完成时:
They had already observed the interadditive effects before publishing the paper. = 他们在发表论文之前就已经观察到交互加成效应。
The team had anticipated an interadditive outcome. = 该团队预计会有交互加成结果。


将来时:
We will likely observe an interadditive response. = 我们很可能会观察到交互加成反应。
The research will explore the interadditive potential of the compounds. = 该研究将探索这些化合物的交互加成潜力。


虚拟语气:
If the components were interadditive, the outcome would be significantly improved. = 如果这些成分是交互加成的，结果将得到显著改善。
It would be beneficial if the effects were truly interadditive. = 如果效果确实是交互加成的，那将是有益的。


被动语态:
The interadditive effect was confirmed by the experiment. = 交互加成效应已由实验确认。
An interadditive response was observed in the control group. = 在对照组中观察到交互加成反应。


疑问句:
Is this a purely interadditive effect? = 这是纯粹的交互加成效应吗？
Are the individual effects truly interadditive? = 各个效应真的是交互加成的吗？


否定句:
The combined effect was not interadditive. = 综合效应并非交互加成的。
The results did not demonstrate an interadditive relationship. = 结果并未显示交互加成关系。


PHRASE->
interadditive effect = 交互加成效应
interadditive properties = 交互加成特性
interadditive relationship = 交互加成关系
interadditive synergy = 交互加成协同作用
interadditive response = 交互加成反应
