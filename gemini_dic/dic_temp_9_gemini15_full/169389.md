pronephros:/ˈproʊnɛfrɒs/| n. |原肾；前肾|The pronephros is the first functional kidney to develop in vertebrate embryos. It is a transient structure, meaning it is only present for a short period during development before being replaced by the mesonephros and then the metanephros.  The pronephros plays a minor role in excretion in some species, but its primary function is to provide a template for the development of the later kidneys.|Example: The pronephros in the zebrafish embryo is easily observable under a microscope.|近义词：forekidney|反义词：metanephros, mesonephros|名词
