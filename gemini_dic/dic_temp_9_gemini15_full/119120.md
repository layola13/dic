词源:
From *metropolitan* + *-ate*.  *Metropolitan* comes from Late Latin *metropolitanus*, from Greek *metropoleitēs* (μετροπολίτης), from *mētropolis* (μήτropolis), meaning "mother city," from *mētēr* (μήτηρ) "mother" + *polis* (πόλις) "city."  The suffix *-ate* forms nouns denoting office, jurisdiction, or result of an action.  Therefore, *metropolitanate* literally means "the jurisdiction or area of a metropolitan."
