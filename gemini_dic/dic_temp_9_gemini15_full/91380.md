hydrotellurate: /ˌhaɪdroʊtɛljuˈreɪt/ | n. | 氢碲酸盐 | A salt or ester of hydrotelluric acid (H₂Te).  Hydrotellurates are compounds containing the anion Te²⁻. They are generally unstable and readily oxidized. |  The synthesis of various organic hydrotellurates is an active area of research. = 各种有机氢碲酸盐的合成是一个活跃的研究领域。  | 近义词: telluride (in some contexts) | 反义词:  None directly, but compounds with higher oxidation states of tellurium could be considered opposites.
