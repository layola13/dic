The word "proauthor" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a newly coined word or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  However, we can speculate on its possible meaning and construction:

It seems to be a blend of "pro" (meaning "in favor of" or "supporting") and "author."  This suggests a possible meaning related to supporting authors or authorship.


Possible Interpretations and Speculative Analysis:

* **Pro-author (hyphenated):** This would mean someone who is in favor of authors, their rights, or their work.  This could encompass various activities such as advocating for better author compensation, supporting independent authors, or promoting literacy.

* **Pro-author (as a noun):** This could refer to an individual who actively supports authors.
