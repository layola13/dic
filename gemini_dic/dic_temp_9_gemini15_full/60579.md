词源:
The word "elatedly" is derived from the adjective "elated," which comes from the past participle of the verb "elate," meaning "to make (someone) feel very happy and excited."  The verb "elate" itself has roots in the Middle English word "elaten," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "elatus," meaning "lifted up," "raised," or "exalted."  The "-ly" suffix is an adverbial suffix, transforming the adjective into an adverb.
