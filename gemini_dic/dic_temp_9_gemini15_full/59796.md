ecotypically:/ˌiːkəʊˈtɪpɪkli/| adv.| 生态型地，根据生态型 | Ecotypically refers to the characteristics or variations within a species that are specifically adapted to a particular ecological niche or environment.  It emphasizes the influence of environmental factors on the phenotypic expression of a genotype. | Example:  The plants exhibited ecotypically distinct adaptations to the different soil conditions.  这些植物表现出对不同土壤条件的生态型上的独特适应性。| 近义词：environmentally, ecologically | 反义词：genetically (in the context of contrasting environmental vs. genetic influence)


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The plants grow ecotypically in this region. = 这些植物在这个地区生态型地生长。
They adapt ecotypically to the harsh climate. = 它们生态型地适应恶劣的气候。


一般过去时:
The species adapted ecotypically to the changing environment. = 该物种生态型地适应了变化的环境。
The researchers studied how the organisms behaved ecotypically. = 研究人员研究了这些生物体如何生态型地活动。


现在完成时:
The population has evolved ecotypically over many generations. =  这个种群已经经过许多代的生态型进化。
Scientists have documented ecotypical variations in this species. = 科学家们已经记录了这个物种的生态型变异。


过去完成时:
The species had already adapted ecotypically before the drought. = 在干旱之前，该物种已经生态型地适应了。
The ecosystem had changed significantly, affecting the organisms ecotypically. = 生态系统发生了显著变化，生态型地影响了生物体。


将来时:
The species will likely adapt ecotypically to the new conditions. = 该物种很可能会生态型地适应新的条件。

虚拟语气:
If the environment were different, the species might evolve ecotypically in a different way. = 如果环境不同，该物种可能会以不同的方式进行生态型进化。
It is desirable that the species adapt ecotypically to the new habitat. =  该物种最好能够生态型地适应新的栖息地。


被动语态:
The variations were shown to be ecotypically determined. = 这些变异被证明是由生态型决定的。
The plant's growth was strongly influenced ecotypically by the altitude. = 植物的生长受到海拔高度的强烈生态型影响。


疑问句:
Are the observed differences truly ecotypically based? = 观察到的差异真的是基于生态型的吗？
How do these organisms adapt ecotypically to such diverse habitats? = 这些生物体是如何生态型地适应如此多样的栖息地的？


否定句:
The differences observed were not solely ecotypically determined. = 观察到的差异并非完全由生态型决定。
The plant's characteristics were not significantly influenced ecotypically. = 植物的特性没有受到生态型的显著影响。


PHRASE->
