The word "cozen" comes from the Middle English word "cosen,"  which ultimately derives from the Old French word "cousiner," meaning "to act as a cousin," implying a deceptive or close relationship used for trickery.  The original meaning suggests a familial or intimate connection exploited for personal gain.
