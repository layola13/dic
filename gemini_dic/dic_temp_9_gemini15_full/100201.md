interresisting: /ˌɪntərɪˈzɪstɪŋ/ | adj. | 相互抵抗的，相互作用的 |  This word is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It appears to be a newly coined or very rarely used word, formed by combining "inter-" (meaning between or among) and "resisting" (the act of opposing or withstanding).  Therefore, a precise definition and usage examples are difficult to provide without further context.  The intended meaning would likely depend on the specific situation where it's used.  It suggests a situation where multiple entities or forces are simultaneously resisting each other. |  Example (hypothetical):  The two political factions were interresisting, preventing any meaningful legislation from passing.  (两个政治派系互相抵抗，阻止任何有意义的立法通过。) | 近义词: mutually opposing, counteracting, conflicting | 反义词: cooperating, collaborating, supporting |  词性: adjective
