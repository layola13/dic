词源:

The word "parafollicular" is a compound word formed from:

* **Para-:**  A prefix meaning "beside," "near," or "alongside."  It comes from the Greek preposition παρά (pará).

* **Follicular:**  An adjective relating to a follicle. "Follicle" comes from the Late Latin *folliculus*, a diminutive of Latin *follis*, meaning "bag" or "purse".  This refers to the small sac-like structures that contain hair roots or other structures.

Therefore, "parafollicular" literally means "beside or near a follicle."
