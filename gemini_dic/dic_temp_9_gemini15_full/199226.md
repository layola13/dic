The word "siller" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "shiller," "silver," or "sillier."  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **It's a dialect word or slang:** It might be used informally in a specific region or community, but not widely known.

3. **It's a newly coined word:**  It could be a newly invented word, a neologism, or a term specific to a niche field.

4. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name or a place name.
