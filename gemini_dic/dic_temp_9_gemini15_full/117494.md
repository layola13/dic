medullated:/ˈmɛdjʊleɪtɪd/| adj.|髓鞘的，有髓鞘的|Having a myelin sheath.  Medullated fibers are nerve fibers that are coated with myelin, a fatty substance that insulates the nerve and speeds up the transmission of nerve impulses.|例句：The medullated nerve fibers transmit signals much faster than unmyelinated ones. 有髓鞘的神经纤维比无髓鞘的神经纤维传输信号快得多。|近义词：myelinated|反义词：unmyelinated


USAGE->

It would be beneficial if we could better understand medullated axon development. = 如果我们能够更好地理解有髓鞘轴突的发育，那将是有益的。


被动语态:
The nerve impulses are rapidly transmitted by medullated axons. = 神经冲动通过有髓鞘的轴突快速传递。
The effects of myelin on medullated fibers are well studied. = 髓鞘对有髓鞘纤维的影响已被充分研究。


疑问句:
Are these nerve fibers medullated or unmyelinated? = 这些神经纤维是有髓鞘的还是无髓鞘的？
How does the medullated sheath affect nerve conduction speed? = 髓鞘如何影响神经传导速度？


否定句:
The nerve fibers are not medullated; therefore, the signal transmission is slow. = 神经纤维不是有髓鞘的；因此，信号传输缓慢。
These axons are not fully medullated during early development. = 这些轴突在早期发育过程中并非完全有髓鞘。


PHRASE->
