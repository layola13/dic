The word "rutilian" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis following the requested format.  It's possible:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* It's a neologism: A newly coined word not yet widely accepted.
* It's a technical term:  Specific to a certain field (e.g., science, engineering).
* It's a proper noun:  A name or place.

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if possible.  I will then be happy to help.
