近义词：urban, metropolitan, sophisticated, refined, cultured | 反义词：rustic, rural, countrified, pastoral, provincial


词源：The word is formed by the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "rustic" (meaning "relating to the countryside").  "Rustic" ultimately derives from the Latin word "rusticus," meaning "belonging to the country."
