词源:

Derived from the word "corrosive," which comes from the Latin word "corrodere," meaning "to gnaw" or "to eat away."  The suffix "-ible" indicates capability or susceptibility, and "-ness" denotes a state or quality.  Therefore, "corrosibleness" literally means "the state or quality of being able to corrode."
