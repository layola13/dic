词源:

Comes from the verb "consider," meaning "to think about carefully,"  plus the suffix "-able," meaning "capable of" or "worthy of."  Therefore, "considerable" originally meant "worthy of consideration" or "deserving of thought," but its meaning evolved to emphasize the size or importance of something.
