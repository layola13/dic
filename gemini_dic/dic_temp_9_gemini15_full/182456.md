The word "renos" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word, such as "reins" (the straps used to control a horse), "renos" (a possible misspelling of "renown" meaning fame), or another word entirely.  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name (of a person, place, or thing) or a brand name not widely known.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word or a slang term used within a specific community or context.  If this is the case, more context is needed to understand its meaning and usage.

4. **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted in English.  If so, specifying the language of origin would be helpful.
