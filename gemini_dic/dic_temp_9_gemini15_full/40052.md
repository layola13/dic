词源:

The word "consumptive" derives from the verb "consume," ultimately from the Latin "consumere," meaning "to use up completely."  In its original medical sense,  "consumptive" referred specifically to consumption, an older term for tuberculosis, a disease that literally "consumed" the body.  The modern usage retains some of this sense of wasting away, but also encompasses more general ideas of excessive spending or use.
