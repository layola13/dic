词源:
The word "leucophlegmatic" is derived from the Greek words:
* *leukos* (λευκός): white
* *phlegma* (φλέγμα): phlegm (a thick mucus secreted in the respiratory tract)

The term originally described a temperament associated with a pale complexion and excessive phlegm, considered a humoral imbalance in ancient medical theory.  Over time, the association with excessive phlegm lessened, and the word came to primarily refer to a pale and apathetic disposition.
