dyadically:/daɪˈædɪkli/ | adv. | 二元地，二进位地 | Relating to or involving dyads or dyadic relationships;  in a manner characteristic of dyadic processes or structures, often involving repeated divisions or subdivisions into two parts.  It frequently appears in the context of mathematics, particularly in relation to algorithms and data structures that recursively divide into halves. | Example: The data was processed dyadically, resulting in a highly efficient algorithm.  数据以二元方式处理，产生了高效的算法。 The image was dyadically subdivided into smaller squares for analysis. 图像被二元细分为较小的正方形以进行分析。| 近义词：binarily, recursively (in certain contexts)| 反义词：monadically (though not a direct antonym, it represents a contrasting approach) |  词性：副词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in mathematical and computational contexts, not in everyday conversation.  Therefore, providing typical grammatical examples in various tenses is not practical or representative of its typical usage.  Instead, we'll illustrate its use in specific contexts:

Mathematical Context:

Example 1: The algorithm dyadically refines the mesh until the desired accuracy is achieved. 该算法二元细化网格，直到达到所需的精度。
Example 2: The wavelet transform is a dyadically based technique for signal processing. 小波变换是一种基于二元法的信号处理技术。


Computational Context:

Example 3:  The image was compressed using a dyadically structured wavelet transform.  图像使用二元结构小波变换进行压缩。
Example 4:  The problem was solved using a dyadic recursion, significantly reducing computational complexity. 该问题使用二元递归求解，显著降低了计算复杂度。


PHRASE->
Phrases specifically using "dyadically" are rare outside of technical papers.  Instead, related phrases might include:


dyadic decomposition: 二元分解
dyadic interval: 二元区间
dyadic tree: 二元树
dyadic rational: 二进有理数
dyadic expansion: 二进展开
