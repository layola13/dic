The word "estonias" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling or a proper noun referring to something specific (perhaps a pluralized version of a name or place).  To provide the requested information, I need clarification on the intended word or context in which it was used.
