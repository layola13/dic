USAGE->

一般现在时:
The schistosity is evident in this sample. = 这个样本中片理构造很明显。
This rock exhibits strong schistosity. = 这块岩石显示出强烈的片理构造。


一般过去时:
Geologists observed the schistosity during the field trip. = 地质学家在实地考察中观察到了片理构造。
The schistosity was formed by regional metamorphism. = 片理构造是由区域变质作用形成的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the schistosity of metamorphic rocks for years. = 科学家们多年来一直在研究变质岩的片理构造。
Researchers have determined the origin of the schistosity. = 研究人员已经确定了片理构造的成因。


过去完成时:
Before the deformation, the rock lacked schistosity. = 变形前，岩石缺乏片理构造。
They had already identified the schistosity before publishing the paper. = 他们在发表论文之前就已经确定了片理构造。


将来时:

疑问句:
What causes the schistosity in this type of rock? = 这种岩石的片理构造是由什么引起的？
Does the schistosity indicate the direction of tectonic stress? = 片理构造是否表明了构造应力的方向？


否定句:
This rock does not show any clear schistosity. = 这块岩石没有显示任何明显的片理构造。
The sample lacked the characteristic schistosity of a typical schist. = 该样品缺乏典型片岩的特征片理构造。
