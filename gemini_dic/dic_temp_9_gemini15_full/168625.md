词源:  The word "proclivity" comes from the Late Latin word *proclivitas*, meaning "inclination," "slope," or "steepness."  This in turn derives from the Latin verb *proclivāre*, meaning "to bend forward," "to incline," or "to lean."  The prefix "pro-" means "forward," and the root "*clivus*" means "slope" or "hill."  Therefore, the original sense implied a leaning or sloping towards something.
