WORD ORIGIN->

The word "declarer" is derived from the verb "declare," meaning to state clearly and formally.  The suffix "-er" is an agent noun suffix, indicating the person who performs the action.  Therefore, "declarer" literally means "one who declares."  Its specific use in bridge developed from the act of declaring one's intention to take a certain number of tricks.
