cyclotron:/ˈsaɪklətrɒn/| n. |回旋加速器|A cyclotron is a type of particle accelerator that uses a magnetic field to bend charged particles into a spiral path, accelerating them to high speeds.  It's used in various scientific research and medical applications, such as producing radioactive isotopes for medical imaging and treatment. |例句：Scientists used a cyclotron to accelerate protons to high energies for research purposes. 科学家们使用回旋加速器将质子加速到高能用于研究。

The cyclotron at the university hospital is used for cancer treatment. 大学医院的回旋加速器用于癌症治疗。|近义词：particle accelerator, synchrotron|反义词：无|词性：名词

词源:
The word "cyclotron" is a combination of "cyclo-" (referring to the circular path of the particles) and "-tron" (a suffix commonly used in the names of particle accelerators, similar to "electron" and "proton").  It was coined by Ernest O. Lawrence, the inventor of the device.
