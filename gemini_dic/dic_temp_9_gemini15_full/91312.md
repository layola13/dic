hydrometrograph:/ˌhaɪdroʊˈmɛtrəɡræf/| n. |水位自动记录仪|A hydrometrograph is an instrument used to automatically record the level of water in a river, lake, or other body of water over time.  It typically consists of a float that rises and falls with the water level, and a mechanism that translates this movement into a continuous graphical record. |The hydrometrograph continuously monitored the river's water level throughout the flood.  水位自动记录仪在整个洪水期间持续监测河流的水位。 The faulty hydrometrograph gave inaccurate readings. 故障的水位自动记录仪给出了不准确的读数。|近义词：water level recorder, stream gauge|反义词：无
