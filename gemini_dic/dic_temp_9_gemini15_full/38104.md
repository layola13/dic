The word "compoundedness's" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be an attempt to make the noun "compoundedness" possessive, but the apostrophe-s is incorrectly applied. "Compoundedness" itself is a noun formed from the adjective "compounded," meaning made up of several parts or elements, often implying complexity or a worsening of a situation.  Therefore, the correct way to show possession would be "compoundedness's" (one apostrophe) or, better yet, to rephrase the sentence to avoid the awkward possessive form.
