词源:

The word "inalienabilities" is derived from the adjective "inalienable," which itself comes from:

* **in-:**  A prefix meaning "not" or "without."
* **alienable:**  Derived from "alien," meaning "belonging to another," and "-able," meaning "capable of being."

Therefore, "inalienable" means "not capable of being alienated" or "not capable of being transferred or surrendered."  The suffix "-ities" turns the adjective into a plural noun, referring to multiple inalienable rights.
