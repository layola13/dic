词源:

The word "nonapproved" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the past participle "approved."  "Approved" derives from the verb "approve," ultimately tracing back to the Old French "aprouver," which means "to prove," "to test," or "to confirm."  The prefix "ap-" is related to the Latin "ad-" (to, towards), and the root is "probare" (to test or prove).  Therefore, "nonapproved" literally means "not officially tested, confirmed, or authorized."
