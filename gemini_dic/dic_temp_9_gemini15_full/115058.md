manducus: /ˈmæn.də.kəs/ | n. | 贪吃者，大胃王 | A person who eats greedily or excessively.  The word suggests voracious eating, often to an excessive or gluttonous degree.  It's less common than synonyms like "glutton" or "gourmand," but carries a slightly more archaic and literary tone. | Example:  He was a true manducus, polishing off three entire roast chickens in one sitting. 他是个十足的大胃王，一口气吃掉了三只烤鸡。 | 近义词：glutton, gourmand, voracious eater | 反义词：abstemious eater, picky eater | 名词
