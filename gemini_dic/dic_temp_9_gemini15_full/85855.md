The word "heach" is not a word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a regional dialect word, a proper noun, or a neologism (newly coined word).  If you can provide more context (e.g., where you encountered this word), a more accurate response may be possible.
