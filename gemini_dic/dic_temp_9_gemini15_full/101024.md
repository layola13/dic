invariants:/ˈɪnvɛəriənts/ | n. | 不变量，不变式 |  A quantity or property which remains unchanged under certain transformations or conditions.  In mathematics, invariants are properties that remain the same even when a system or object undergoes a transformation.  For example, the number of vertices in a polygon remains invariant under rotation. In physics, invariants are conserved quantities, such as energy or momentum. | Example: The total energy of a closed system is an invariant.  能量守恒定律表明封闭系统的总能量是不变量。 | 近义词：constants, constants of motion | 反义词：variables, variants |  名词
