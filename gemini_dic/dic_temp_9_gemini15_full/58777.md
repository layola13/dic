词源:
The word "dunness" derives from the adjective "dun," meaning a dull brownish-gray color.  This color itself is associated with darkness, gloom, and obscurity.  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix that transforms adjectives into nouns, indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, "dunnesses" signifies the state or quality of being dun, specifically referring to the pervasive feeling of gloom, drabness, and obscurity.
