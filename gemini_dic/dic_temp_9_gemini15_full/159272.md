poikilothermous:/ˌpɔɪkɪˈlɒθərməs/| adj. | 变温的；冷血的 |  An organism whose internal temperature varies considerably depending on the ambient environmental temperature.  Poikilothermous animals, unlike homeotherms, cannot regulate their own body temperature internally; their body temperature fluctuates with changes in the surrounding environment.  |Example: Lizards are poikilothermous animals, meaning their body temperature changes with the temperature of their surroundings.  蜥蜴是变温动物，这意味着它们的体温会随着周围环境温度的变化而变化。|近义词：cold-blooded (informal), ectothermic |反义词：homeothermic
