observables:/əbˈzɜːrvəblz/| n. |可观察量，可观测值|Something that can be observed or measured.  In physics, it refers to a quantity that can be directly measured or inferred from a measurement. In programming, particularly in reactive programming, it represents a value that can change over time and whose changes can be observed.|The scientist meticulously recorded all observables during the experiment. 科学家仔细记录了实验中所有可观察到的现象。  The application updates the UI based on changes in the observables. 应用根据可观察量变化更新用户界面。|measurable quantities, data points, variables |unobservable, immeasurable|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The observables are currently stable. = 可观察量目前稳定。
We observe the changes in these observables. = 我们观察这些可观察量的变化。


一般过去时:
The observables were highly volatile yesterday. = 昨天可观察量非常不稳定。
Scientists carefully analyzed the past observables. = 科学家仔细分析了过去的可观察量。


现在完成时:
The system has logged all the observables. = 系统已记录所有可观察量。
We have observed significant changes in the observables. = 我们已经观察到可观察量的显著变化。


过去完成时:
The experiment had already yielded several key observables. = 实验已经产生了几个关键的可观察量。
Before the analysis, they had not considered all possible observables. = 在分析之前，他们没有考虑所有可能的可观察量。


将来时:
The researchers will monitor the observables closely. = 研究人员将密切监测可观察量。
We will analyze the observables to draw conclusions. = 我们将分析可观察量以得出结论。


虚拟语气:
If the observables were different, the results would be different. = 如果可观察量不同，结果也会不同。
It is essential that all relevant observables be measured accurately. = 准确测量所有相关可观察量至关重要。


被动语态:
The observables are being monitored continuously. = 可观察量正在持续监测中。
The changes in the observables were carefully documented. = 可观察量的变化被仔细记录。


疑问句:
What are the key observables in this model? = 在这个模型中，关键的可观察量是什么？
How are the observables being collected? = 可观察量是如何收集的？


否定句:
There were no significant changes in the observables. = 可观察量没有发生显著变化。
The experiment did not produce any unexpected observables. = 实验没有产生任何意外的可观察量。


PHRASE->
observable quantity = 可观察量
observable effect = 可观察效应
observable properties = 可观察特性
observable behavior = 可观察行为
observable universe = 可观测宇宙
