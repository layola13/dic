词源:

The term "ghosting" emerged in the early 21st century as a slang term to describe the act of abruptly cutting off all communication with someone without explanation.  Its origins are rooted in the idea of a person becoming like a ghost, disappearing silently and unexpectedly from someone's life.  The term's usage increased significantly with the rise of online dating and social media, where it's easier to cease contact without direct confrontation.
