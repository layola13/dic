/ˌnɒnkənˈsʌmptɪvnəsɪz/ | n. | 非消费性；非消耗性 | The word "nonconsumptivenesses" is an extremely rare and unusual word, essentially a plural form of "nonconsumptiveness," which itself is not commonly used.  It refers to instances or qualities of not being consumptive or not involving consumption.  The word is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), the root "consumptive" (relating to consumption), and the suffix "-ness" (indicating a state or quality), then finally "-es" to create the plural.   There's no readily available example sentence in standard English usage because of its rarity. The word is grammatically correct but highly impractical in everyday communication.  | 近义词: instances of non-consumption, examples of non-use | 反义词: consumptions, usages
