kilovoltage:/ˈkɪləʊˈvɒltiːdʒ/ | n. | 千伏电压 | Kilovoltage refers to an electromotive force or potential difference expressed in kilovolts (kV), a unit of 1000 volts.  It's commonly used to describe high voltages in various applications, particularly in X-ray machines and other electrical systems. | Example: The X-ray machine operates at a kilovoltage of 100 kV.  X射线机在100千伏的电压下工作。  The high kilovoltage caused a power surge. 高千伏电压导致了电源浪涌。 |近义词：high voltage, potential difference | 反义词：low voltage, millivoltage

疑问句:
What is the kilovoltage setting for this equipment? = 这台设备的千伏电压设置是多少？
What kilovoltage did you use in the experiment? = 你在实验中使用了多少千伏电压？


否定句:
The kilovoltage was not high enough to penetrate the material. = 千伏电压不足以穿透材料。
The system did not maintain a stable kilovoltage throughout the process. = 该系统在整个过程中没有保持稳定的千伏电压。


PHRASE->
high kilovoltage
peak kilovoltage
kilovoltage setting
kilovoltage waveform
kilovoltage potential


词源:
kilo- (from Greek χίλιοι (khílioi) meaning "thousand") + voltage (from volt, named after Alessandro Volta).  Thus, kilovoltage literally means "thousand volts".
