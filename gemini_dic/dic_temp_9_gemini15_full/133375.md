The word "nonextraneousnesses" is extremely rare and largely artificial.  It's a complex, heavily-suffixed word formed by combining several morphemes:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of."
* **extraneous**: An adjective meaning "irrelevant" or "unnecessary."  It originates from the Latin "extraneus," meaning "outside" or "foreign."
* **-ness**: A suffix that transforms an adjective into a noun, indicating a state, quality, or condition.
* **-es**: A plural suffix.


Therefore, "nonextraneousnesses" literally means "the plural of the state or quality of being not extraneous."  In simpler terms, it refers to multiple things that are not irrelevant or unnecessary. However, due to its clumsiness, the word is virtually never used in common speech or writing.  It's much clearer and more natural to use simpler terms like "relevant factors," "essential elements," or "key aspects."


USAGE->
This word is so rarely used that providing examples of its usage in different grammatical tenses is impractical and artificial.  The word itself is a construct unlikely to appear in typical English sentences.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "nonextraneousnesses."  The word is too unwieldy and unnatural for phrasal usage.
