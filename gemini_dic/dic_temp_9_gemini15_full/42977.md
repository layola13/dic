词源:

The word "covetable" derives from the verb "covet," meaning "to yearn intensely for something that belongs to another."  "Covet" ultimately traces back to the Old French word "coveiter," which shares roots with the Latin word "cupiditas," meaning "desire" or "greed."  The "-able" suffix transforms the verb into an adjective, indicating something capable of being coveted or worthy of being desired.
