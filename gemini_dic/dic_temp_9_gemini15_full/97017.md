词源:

The word "infeasibleness" is derived from the adjective "feasible," meaning capable of being done or accomplished.  "In-" is a prefix meaning "not," thus "infeasible" means "not feasible" or "impossible."  "-ness" is a suffix that transforms an adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality. Therefore, "infeasibleness" signifies the state or quality of being impossible or impractical.
