The word "fittedness" itself doesn't have a rich history of independent usage like many other words. It's a relatively modern formation, derived directly from the adjective "fitted."  Therefore, its etymology traces back to the verb "fit," which has Old English roots.

* **fit (verb):**  Comes from Old English *fittan* meaning "to be suitable, proper, or appropriate." This root connects to a broader Proto-Germanic base and even further back to Proto-Indo-European roots related to the concept of joining or fitting together.

* **fit (adjective):** Derived from the verb "fit," meaning "suitable," "appropriate," or "well-adapted."

* **fittedness (noun):**  A relatively recent noun formation derived from the adjective "fitted," meaning the state or quality of being fit or suitable.  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix used to form nouns of abstract qualities (e.g., goodness, happiness, sadness).

* **fittedness's (noun):** This is the possessive form of "fittedness," showing ownership or relationship.  For example,  "the fittedness's of the design" refers to the properties of fitness inherent in the design.

**USAGE:**  Because "fittedness" is a relatively new and less common word, there's no specific "tense" conjugation like a verb.  Its usage primarily involves describing a noun's quality.  The possessive form adds a layer of indicating possession or relationship:

**Examples illustrating the usage of "fittedness" (and by extension, "fittedness's"):**

* **General usage:** The fittedness of the new software to the company's needs was crucial. (新软件对公司需求的适用性至关重要。)

* **In a comparative sense:**  The fittedness of Model A surpassed that of Model B. (模型A的适用性超过了模型B。)


* **Using the possessive form:** The experiment's fittedness's to the theoretical predictions were analyzed. (实验的适用性与理论预测进行了分析。)

* **In a sentence showing a relationship:** The study examined the fittedness's impact on the overall success. (研究调查了适用性对整体成功的影响。)


**PHRASES:** There aren't established, common phrases directly using "fittedness" or "fittedness's" because it's not a frequently used word.  Phrases would usually incorporate "fittedness" within a larger descriptive sentence.

It's important to note that while grammatically correct,  using "fittedness's" might sound slightly awkward in many contexts.  Often, rephrasing the sentence to avoid the possessive form would improve clarity and naturalness.  For example, instead of "the fittedness's of the model," consider "the model's fittedness" or "how well the model fit."
