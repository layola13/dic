The word "predreads" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a particular field or community.  Therefore, a full analysis following the requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need clarification on the intended word or its context.
