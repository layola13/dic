词源:

The word "disillusionment" comes from the verb "disillusion," which is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "removal of," "opposite of") and the noun "illusion."  "Illusion" ultimately derives from the Latin word "illusio," meaning "mocking," "deception," or "a mockery." Therefore, disillusionment literally means the removal or destruction of an illusion, leading to a feeling of disappointment or disenchantment.
