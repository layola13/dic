词源:
The word "power-walk" is a compound word formed by combining "power" and "walk."  "Power" implies strength, energy, and intensity, while "walk" refers to the act of moving on foot. The term arose in the late 20th century to describe a purposeful and vigorous style of walking, often undertaken for fitness.
