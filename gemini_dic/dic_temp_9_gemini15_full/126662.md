The word "nakoo" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It doesn't have a standard pronunciation, grammatical properties, or established meaning in English.  Therefore, a detailed analysis following the requested format is impossible.  It's likely a word from another language, slang, or a neologism.  To provide an analysis, more context is needed, such as:

* **Origin:** Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the language or context (e.g., online chat, specific region, etc.) would help identify its origin and meaning.
* **Usage:** Can you provide sentences or examples of how the word is used? This will help determine its function (noun, verb, etc.) and meaning.


Without this information, any analysis would be pure speculation.
