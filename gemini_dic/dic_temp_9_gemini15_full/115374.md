The word "mansam" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information according to the requested format.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* **It's a neologism:** It might be a newly coined word, a slang term, or specific to a particular dialect or community.  If this is the case, more context is needed to understand its meaning.
* **It's a word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language.  If so, please specify the language.


Please provide more information or context so I can assist you effectively.
