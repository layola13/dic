conductibility:/ˌkɒndʌktɪˈbɪləti/ /ˌkɑːndʌktɪˈbɪləti/ | n. | 传导性，导电性，传导率 | The ability of a material to conduct electricity, heat, or sound.  It refers to how easily a substance allows the flow of these forms of energy.  High conductibility means easy flow, while low conductibility means resistance to flow. | The high conductibility of copper makes it ideal for electrical wiring.  高导电性的铜使其成为电线的理想材料。


The thermal conductibility of this material is surprisingly low.  这种材料的导热性出奇地低。| conductivity, conductance | resistance, resistivity |  名词
