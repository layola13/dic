/nɑːnsʌbˈkɒnʃəsnəsɪz/ | n. |非潜意识 |The word "nonsubconsciousnesses" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a neologism, formed by combining "non-" (not), "subconscious" (below the level of conscious awareness), and the plural "-nesses".  It might be intended to refer to aspects of experience or mental states that are explicitly *not* subconscious, i.e., fully conscious or outside the realm of the subconscious altogether. However, its meaning is highly context-dependent and requires further clarification from the user who coined it.  There are no established synonyms or antonyms.


例句： (Since the word is not standard, examples are hypothetical and illustrative of a possible intended meaning)

*He attributed his sudden outburst not to subconscious urges, but to a series of entirely conscious, deliberate nonsubconsciousnesses.*  (他将他的突然爆发归因于一系列完全有意识的、蓄意的非潜意识行为，而不是潜意识的冲动。)

*The study aimed to distinguish between subconscious motivations and explicit, nonsubconsciousnesses guiding behavior.* (这项研究旨在区分潜意识动机和指导行为的明确的非潜意识因素。)


近义词：None (as it's not a standard word).  Possible related concepts might include: conscious thoughts, deliberate actions, overt behaviors.


反义词：Subconsciousnesses (though this is the opposite only if the neologism is interpreted as described above).
