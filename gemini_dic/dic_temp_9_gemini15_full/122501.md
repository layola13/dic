PHRASE->

词源:

The word "mockadour" is not found in standard etymological dictionaries. It seems to be a relatively recent coinage, possibly a blend or humorous invention, perhaps drawing on the sound and sense of words like "mock" (to imitate derisively) and "adorer" (one who adores or excessively praises).  The "-adour" suffix may evoke a similar sound to words like "braggadocio".  The precise origin remains obscure.
