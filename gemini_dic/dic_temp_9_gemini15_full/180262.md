词源:
The word "refrain" comes from the Old French word "refrein," meaning "to bridle," "to hold back," or "to restrain."  The original sense referred to the holding back of a horse, which then evolved to mean restraining oneself from doing something.  The musical sense developed later, referring to the repeated lines in a song that serve as a "restraining" or repeating element.
