词源:

The word "firebombing" is a relatively modern compound word.  It combines "firebomb" (itself a compound of "fire" and "bomb") with the "-ing" suffix to create a gerund, indicating the action of attacking with firebombs.  The etymology of "fire" and "bomb" are well established, tracing back to Old English and Proto-Germanic respectively.  The use of "firebombing" as a term specifically to describe the widespread use of incendiary bombs during World War II solidified its place in the lexicon.
