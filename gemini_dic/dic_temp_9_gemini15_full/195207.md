词源:

* **semi-**:  A prefix meaning "half," "partially," or "partly."  Derived from Latin *semi*.

* **dramatic**:  Relating to drama or theatrical performance.  Derived from Greek *drama* (action, deed).  The suffix *-atic* is of Greek origin, creating an adjectival form.

* **-ally**:  A suffix forming adverbs from adjectives.  Derived from Old French *-alment* and ultimately from Latin *-aliter*.

Therefore, "semidramatically" literally means "in a partly dramatic manner."
