precondensation: /ˌpriːkɒndɛnˈseɪʃən/ | n. |预凝聚，初步凝聚| The initial stage of condensation, often involving the formation of small clusters or aggregates of molecules before larger droplets or solid particles form.  It's a preliminary stage before full condensation occurs.  This process is crucial in various fields, including atmospheric science, materials science, and chemistry. | Example:  The precondensation of water vapor on dust particles is essential for cloud formation. 预凝结的水蒸气在尘埃颗粒上对于云的形成至关重要。 | 近义词:  initial condensation, nucleation | 反义词:  evaporation, vaporization |  词性：名词
