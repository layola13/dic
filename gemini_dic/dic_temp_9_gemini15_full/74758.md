词源:

The word "freewill" is a compound word, combining "free" (meaning "unconstrained" or "independent") and "will" (meaning "volition" or "desire").  The roots of "free" trace back to Old English *frēo, while "will" originates from Old English *willa, related to the verb "willen," meaning "to want" or "to desire."  The combination emerged in Middle English to express the concept of unconstrained choice or agency.
