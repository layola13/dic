词源:

The word "landlordship" is a compound word. It combines "landlord" with the suffix "-ship."

* **Landlord:** This word itself is a compound of "land" and "lord."  "Land" refers to the property, and "lord" historically signified a person with significant power and authority over that land.

* **-ship:** This suffix denotes "state," "condition," "office," "skill," or "quality."  It's commonly used to create nouns denoting a status or role (e.g., friendship, hardship, workmanship).

Therefore, "landlordship" signifies the state or condition of being a landlord, including the associated rights, responsibilities, and authority.  The etymology reflects the historical power dynamic between landlords and tenants.
