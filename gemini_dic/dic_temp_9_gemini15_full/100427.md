intertouch:/ˈɪntərˌtʌtʃ/| n. |互动触碰；交互式触摸|The word "intertouch" is a relatively new coinage, combining "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and "touch" (referring to physical contact or interaction). It describes a system or technology that allows for interactive touch experiences, often in a digital context.  For example, a multi-touch screen would be described as having intertouch capabilities. The term emphasizes the reciprocal nature of the interaction, where the user's touch affects the system, and the system responds to the touch.|例句：The new exhibit features intertouch displays that allow visitors to explore the artwork in a dynamic way.  新的展览展出了交互式触摸显示屏，让参观者可以以动态的方式探索艺术作品。 The museum's intertouch technology provides a user-friendly experience for learning about the history. 博物馆的交互式触摸技术为学习历史提供了用户友好的体验。|近义词：interactive touchscreen, multi-touch interface|反义词：single-touch interface, non-interactive display|n.
