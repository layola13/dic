词源:  The phrasal verb "deal someone in" originates from card games. In card games, "to deal" means to distribute cards. "Dealing someone in" literally meant giving someone a hand of cards, thus including them in the game.  This meaning then extended metaphorically to include someone in any activity or plan.
