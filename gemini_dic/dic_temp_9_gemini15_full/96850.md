Word Origin:

The word "inexactness" is formed by adding the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") to the word "exactness."  "Exactness" itself derives from the word "exact," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "exactus," the past participle of "exigere," meaning "to demand, require, drive out."  Therefore, "inexactness" literally means "not being precisely required or demanded," indicating a lack of precision or accuracy.
