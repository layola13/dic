词源:
The word is formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or to an excessive degree) to the verb "persecute."  "Persecute" itself comes from the Latin word "persequi," meaning "to follow up, pursue, or prosecute."  The addition of "over-" intensifies the meaning of "persecute," highlighting the excessive and unjust nature of the action.
