词源:
The word "concupiscence" comes from the Late Latin word *concupiscentia*, a noun derived from the verb *concupiscere*, meaning "to desire eagerly; to covet."  This verb itself is a combination of the prefix *con-* (meaning "together, intensely") and *cupīre*, meaning "to desire."  Therefore, the root meaning points to an intense and often overwhelming desire.  The word entered English through Old French.
