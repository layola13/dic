词源 (Etymology):

The word "pedanticalness" is derived from the adjective "pedantic," which in turn comes from the Italian word "pedante," meaning "schoolmaster" or "teacher."  The Italian word ultimately derives from the Greek word "paidagogos," meaning "teacher of boys," which is composed of "pais" (child) and "agōgos" (leader, guide). Over time, "pedantic" acquired a negative connotation, implying an excessive or ostentatious display of learning.  "-ness" is a suffix that turns adjectives into nouns, indicating a state or quality.
