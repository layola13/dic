词源:  The word "misdemean" comes from the Old French word "mesdemener," which means "to mismanage" or "to behave badly."  The prefix "mis-" indicates wrong or bad, and "demean" originally meant "to conduct oneself" or "to behave." Over time, "misdemean" evolved to encompass both the act of behaving badly and the resulting offense.
