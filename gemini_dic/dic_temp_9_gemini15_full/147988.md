近义词: replaceable, supersedable, modifiable, changeable | 反义词: immutable, unchangeable, fixed

词源:  The word comes from the verb "override," which is composed of the prefix "over-" (meaning "above" or "beyond") and the verb "ride" (meaning to "control" or "dominate").  Adding the suffix "-able" makes it an adjective, signifying something capable of being overridden.
