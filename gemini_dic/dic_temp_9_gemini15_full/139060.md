词源:
The word "oases" is the plural of the noun "oasis."  It comes from the Ancient Greek word "ὄασις" (óasis), which was itself borrowed from an Egyptian word.  The ultimate origin is likely a Semitic word, possibly related to the ancient Egyptian word wḥ3t meaning “place of life”.


用法说明:
oases is always used as a plural noun.  There is no singular form that is used in modern English; the singular is "oasis".  It refers to multiple fertile spots in a desert or arid region.  The word implies water, vegetation, and a contrast to the surrounding barren landscape.
