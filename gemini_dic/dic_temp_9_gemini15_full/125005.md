词源:

The word "mugshot" is a blend of "mug" (meaning "face" or "to attack") and "shot" (meaning "photograph").  The term "mug" in this context likely arose from slang usage referring to a person's face, and the combination created a concise and descriptive term for a photographic record of an arrested individual's face.  The use of "mug" to describe a person's face, particularly in a criminal context, dates back to the late 19th century.
