oblateness:/ˈɒblətəs/|n.|扁率，椭圆度|The degree to which a body, such as a planet or star, deviates from a perfect sphere;  the difference between the equatorial and polar diameters divided by the equatorial diameter. It's a measure of how squashed or flattened an object is.|The Earth's oblateness is approximately 1/298.  地球的扁率大约是1/298。|The oblateness of Saturn is quite significant. 土星的扁率相当显著。|spheroidicity, ellipticity|sphericity|


USAGE->

过去完成时:
Before the satellite data, the oblateness was poorly understood. = 在卫星数据出现之前，人们对扁率的了解很差。
They had already calculated the oblateness using different methods. = 他们已经使用不同的方法计算了扁率。


将来时:
Future missions will refine measurements of planetary oblateness. = 未来任务将改进对行星扁率的测量。
