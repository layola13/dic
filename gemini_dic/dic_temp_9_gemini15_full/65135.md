ethide:/ˈiːθaɪd/| n. |乙基 |An ethide is a chemical group or substituent with the formula -C₂H₅. It's derived from ethane (C₂H₆) by removing one hydrogen atom.  Ethides are often found as part of larger organic molecules or as anionic ligands in organometallic compounds.  |例句：Lithium ethide is a strong base used in organic chemistry. 乙基锂是有机化学中常用的一种强碱。|近义词：ethyl group (乙基) |反义词：N/A
