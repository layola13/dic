词源:
The word "right-hand" is a compound word, combining "right" (meaning "correct" or "on the right side") and "hand" (referring to the appendage of the human body).  The meaning evolved to specifically describe the hand on the right side of the body.  The etymology of "right" traces back to Proto-Germanic and further to Proto-Indo-European roots associated with concepts of straightness and correctness.  The word "hand" has similarly ancient origins, connecting to Proto-Germanic and Proto-Indo-European words for the same body part.
