词源:  The word "homophobia" is a relatively modern coinage, appearing in the late 20th century. It combines the Greek roots "homo" (same) and "phobos" (fear), reflecting the fear of or aversion to homosexuality.  The term's usage has evolved, and it now often encompasses not just fear, but also hatred, prejudice, and discrimination against homosexuals.
