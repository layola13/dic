词源:  The term "hair-raising" originates from the physiological response of fear, where adrenaline causes the hair follicles to stand on end (causing "goosebumps"). This physical reaction is associated with feelings of fright or intense excitement. The phrase likely emerged in the 19th century as a vivid way to describe experiences that caused this physical response.
