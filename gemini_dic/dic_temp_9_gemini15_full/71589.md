词源:  The word "flashy" originates from the word "flash," meaning a sudden, brief burst of light or color.  The adjectival form "flashy" developed to describe things that are similarly bright, noticeable, and often ostentatious, like a flash of light.  The association with showiness and a lack of subtlety evolved over time.
