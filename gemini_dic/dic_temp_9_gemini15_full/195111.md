semiconductors:/ˌsɛmɪˈkənˌdʌktərz/ | n. | 半导体 | A semiconductor is a material that has electrical conductivity between that of a conductor and an insulator.  Its conductivity can be changed by varying temperature, the application of electric fields, or the addition of small amounts of impurities (doping). Semiconductors are fundamental to modern electronics, forming the basis of transistors, integrated circuits, and many other devices. | Example: Silicon is a common semiconductor used in the manufacturing of computer chips.  硅是制造电脑芯片常用的半导体。

The development of semiconductor technology revolutionized the electronics industry. 半导体技术的发展彻底改变了电子工业。


近义词：none (no perfect synonym, as it's a specific material class) | 反义词：conductor, insulator | 词性:n.
