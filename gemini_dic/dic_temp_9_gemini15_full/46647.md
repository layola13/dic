词源:
The word "damnification" is derived from the verb "damnify," meaning "to cause damage or harm to," which in turn ultimately comes from the word "damn," meaning "to condemn" or "to inflict punishment upon."  The suffix "-fication" indicates the process of making or becoming something.  Therefore, "damnification" literally means "the act of causing damage or harm," though its usage may be less common than synonyms.
