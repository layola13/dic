PHRASE->
insect endosternite: 昆虫内胸骨
structure of endosternite: 内胸骨的结构
function of endosternite: 内胸骨的功能

词源:  The word is a combination of "endo-" (Greek, meaning "within" or "inner"), "sterno-" (Greek, referring to the sternum or breastbone), and "-ite" (a suffix often used to form nouns, particularly in biology, indicating a substance or part).  Therefore, it literally means "inner breastbone structure" or "internal sternal element."
