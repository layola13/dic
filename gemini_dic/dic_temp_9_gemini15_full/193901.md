self-donations:/ˌsɛlfdoʊˈneɪʃənz/| n. | 自愿捐赠 | Donations made by individuals to themselves, often within a specific framework like a retirement plan or charitable giving. This term is less common and can be ambiguous; it's usually more precise to specify the context (e.g., self-directed retirement plan contributions, charitable donations to one's own foundation).|Example:  The company allows self-donations to the employee stock ownership plan up to a certain limit. 公司允许员工向员工持股计划进行自愿捐款，但金额有限制。


There is no direct translation for "self-donation" in many languages because it's a less common phrase.  The translation needs to reflect the specific context.  For example:  "contributions to one's own retirement account" or "donations to one's own charity."

近义词:  (depending on context) personal contribution, self-contribution, individual donation, private donation

反义词:  (no direct antonym, as it depends on context)  If referring to donations to others, the antonym would be receiving donations.  If referring to not contributing to a specific plan, the antonym would be  non-contribution.
