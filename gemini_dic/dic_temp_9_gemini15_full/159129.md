词源:  The word derives from the Italian "poco curante," literally meaning "little caring" or "not much caring."  "Poco" means "little" or "few," and "curante" is the present participle of "curare," meaning "to care" or "to mind."  It entered English through the influence of Italian culture and literature, particularly during the period of the Grand Tour.
