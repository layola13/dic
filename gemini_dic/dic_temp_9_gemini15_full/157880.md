词源:
The word "plainly" derives from the Old English word "plæne," meaning "flat, level, smooth."  This evolved into the Middle English "pleyn," which had both literal and figurative meanings, including "clear," "simple," and "open." The adverbial form "-ly" was then added to create "plainly."  The connection lies in the idea that something that is flat and level is easy to understand, hence the evolution of the meaning to "clearly" or "simply."
