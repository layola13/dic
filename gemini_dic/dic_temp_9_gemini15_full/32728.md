chlorofluorocarbon:/ˌklɔːroʊˌflʊəroʊˈkɑːrbən/| n. |氟氯烃|A chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) is an organic compound that contains only carbon, chlorine, and fluorine, produced as volatile derivatives of methane, ethane, and propane.  They are also called freons. CFCs are non-toxic and non-flammable, and were widely used as refrigerants, propellants (in aerosols), and solvents.  However, they are now known to deplete the ozone layer, leading to their phase-out under the Montreal Protocol.| Example: The release of chlorofluorocarbons into the atmosphere has caused significant damage to the ozone layer.  氟氯烃的释放到大气中已经对臭氧层造成了严重的破坏。|近义词：freon (less formal)|反义词：N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
CFCs damage the ozone layer. = 氟氯烃破坏臭氧层。
Scientists study the effects of CFCs. = 科学家研究氟氯烃的影响。


一般过去时:
CFCs were widely used in refrigerators. = 氟氯烃广泛用于冰箱。
Companies produced large quantities of CFCs. = 公司生产了大量的氟氯烃。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered the harmful effects of CFCs. = 科学家已经发现了氟氯烃的有害影响。
Regulations have been implemented to phase out CFCs. = 已经实施法规以逐步淘汰氟氯烃。


过去完成时:
The ozone layer had already been damaged before the dangers of CFCs were fully understood. = 在人们充分了解氟氯烃的危害之前，臭氧层就已经受到了破坏。
Scientists had already warned about the dangers of CFCs before the 1980s. = 在20世纪80年代之前，科学家们就已经警告过氟氯烃的危险。


将来时:
Scientists will continue to monitor the ozone layer. = 科学家们将继续监测臭氧层。
The use of CFCs will continue to decline. = 氟氯烃的使用将继续下降。


虚拟语气:
If we had not used CFCs, the ozone layer would not be so damaged. = 如果我们没有使用氟氯烃，臭氧层就不会受到如此严重的破坏。
It is essential that we find alternatives to CFCs. = 我们必须找到氟氯烃的替代品。


被动语态:
CFCs were released into the atmosphere. = 氟氯烃被释放到大气中。
The ozone layer is being repaired slowly. = 臭氧层正在缓慢修复。


疑问句:
What are the long-term effects of CFCs? = 氟氯烃的长期影响是什么？
How can we effectively reduce CFC emissions? = 我们如何有效减少氟氯烃排放？


否定句:
CFCs are not harmless to the environment. = 氟氯烃对环境并非无害。
The use of CFCs has not been completely eliminated. = 氟氯烃的使用尚未完全消除。


PHRASE->
CFC emissions = 氟氯烃排放
CFC depletion = 氟氯烃消耗
CFC substitutes = 氟氯烃替代品
phase out CFCs = 逐步淘汰氟氯烃
Montreal Protocol on CFCs = 关于氟氯烃的蒙特利尔议定书
