词源:

The word "child-likeness" is a compound word formed from "childlike" + "-ness."

"Childlike" itself combines "child" (Old English *cild) and the suffix "-like" (meaning "similar to," from Old English -lic).

"-ness" is a suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.  Therefore, "child-likeness" denotes the state or quality of being childlike.
