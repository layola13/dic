词源:
The word "juggler" comes from the Middle English word "jugelour," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "jogleor."  The Old French word has roots in the Germanic word “*gagalō”, meaning "to boast, to brag".  The original sense was more of a "trickster" or "entertainer" who might use tricks or jokes as well as juggling.  Over time, the meaning narrowed to specifically refer to someone who juggles objects.
