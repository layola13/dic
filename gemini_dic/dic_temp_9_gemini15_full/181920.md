remandments:/rɪˈmændmənts/| n.| 遣送回；(复数) 训诫；命令 | The word "remandments" is not a standard English word.  It seems to be a blend or a misspelling, possibly intended to mean "remands" (the act of sending someone back to custody) or a pluralized form of a word related to "commandments" (religious or moral rules).  Therefore, providing a full analysis like the example is impossible.  The meaning and usage would depend entirely on the intended meaning of the person who used it. |There are no examples, synonyms, or antonyms for a non-existent word. |  There are no grammatical analyses possible for a non-standard word.
