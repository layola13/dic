WORD ORIGIN:

The word "hyperbola" comes from the Greek word ὑπερβολή (hyperbolē), meaning "excess," "exaggeration," or "overthrowing."  This is fitting, as a hyperbola can be thought of as an exaggeration of a circle or ellipse. The "-ae" ending indicates a plural form, and the apostrophe-s ('s) denotes possession.
