The word "limitour" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It might be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific jargon or dialect, or a proper noun.  More context is needed to determine its meaning and properties.
