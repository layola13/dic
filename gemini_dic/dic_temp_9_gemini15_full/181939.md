反义词： ordinary, commonplace, insignificant, unremarkable, typical


词源:  The word "remarkable" comes from the verb "remark," meaning "to notice or mention something noteworthy." The suffix "-able" means "capable of being" or "worthy of."  Therefore, "remarkable" literally means "worthy of being remarked upon" or "worthy of notice."  Its origins trace back to Old French "remarquer" (to notice) and ultimately to Latin "re-" (again) and "marca" (a mark).
