词源:
The word "penthouselike" is a compound adjective formed from "penthouse" and the suffix "-like".

"Penthouse" itself originates from the French "pent-house,"  a combination of "pent" (meaning "leaning, sloping") and "house". This refers to a structure built on a sloping roof, originally often a small, added structure. Over time, its meaning evolved to describe the luxurious top-floor apartments commonly found in modern buildings.

The suffix "-like" is a common English suffix that creates adjectives meaning "resembling" or "similar to".  It's derived from Old English "-lic" or "-líc".
