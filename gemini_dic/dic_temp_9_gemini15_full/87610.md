heterozygotes:/ˌhetərəˈzaɪɡoʊts/| n. |杂合子| Individuals possessing two different alleles for a particular gene.  Heterozygotes are often phenotypically distinct from both homozygous dominant and homozygous recessive individuals due to incomplete dominance or codominance. | Example:  In pea plants, a heterozygote for flower color (Rr) would have pink flowers, while homozygous dominant (RR) would have red flowers and homozygous recessive (rr) would have white flowers.  The heterozygote displays a blend of the two homozygous phenotypes. |近义词: hybrid |反义词: homozygotes


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Heterozygotes often exhibit intermediate phenotypes. = 杂合子通常表现出中间表型。
The number of heterozygotes in the population varies. = 种群中杂合子的数量变化很大。


一般过去时:
Scientists studied the heterozygotes' traits. = 科学家研究了杂合子的性状。
The researchers identified several heterozygotes in their sample. = 研究人员在样本中鉴定出几个杂合子。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified many heterozygotes for this gene. = 研究人员已经鉴定了许多该基因的杂合子。
We have observed that heterozygotes are more resistant to disease. = 我们观察到杂合子对疾病更具抵抗力。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had already selected the heterozygotes. = 实验之前，他们已经选好了杂合子。
The scientists had analyzed the data from the heterozygotes. = 科学家们已经分析了来自杂合子的数据。


将来时:
We will analyze the heterozygotes using advanced techniques. = 我们将使用先进的技术来分析杂合子。
Researchers will investigate the genetic makeup of heterozygotes. = 研究人员将调查杂合子的基因构成。


虚拟语气:
If these were heterozygotes, the results would be different. = 如果这些是杂合子，结果就会不同。
It would be helpful if we had more heterozygotes in our study. = 如果我们的研究中有更多杂合子，那将会有帮助。


被动语态:
The heterozygotes were carefully selected for the experiment. = 杂合子被仔细地挑选用于实验。
The phenotypes of the heterozygotes are being studied. = 杂合子的表型正在被研究。


疑问句:
Are these individuals heterozygotes or homozygotes? = 这些个体是杂合子还是纯合子？
How many heterozygotes are present in this population? = 在这个种群中存在多少杂合子？


否定句:
These plants are not heterozygotes; they are homozygotes. = 这些植物不是杂合子；它们是纯合子。
The study did not include a sufficient number of heterozygotes. = 这项研究没有包含足够的杂合子。


PHRASE->
heterozygote advantage: 杂合子优势
heterozygote screening: 杂合子筛查
heterozygote frequency: 杂合子频率

heterozygote mapping: 杂合子作图


词源:
Heterozygotes is formed from "hetero-" (meaning different or other) and "-zygotes" (referring to a fertilized egg or zygote).  The term describes individuals with different alleles for a given gene.
