glycogen:/ˈɡlaɪkədʒən/| n.|糖原|A polysaccharide of glucose that serves as a form of energy storage in animals and fungi.  It is the analogue of starch in plants.|例句：The liver stores glycogen for later use. 肝脏储存糖原以备后用。

例句：Muscles also store glycogen to fuel physical activity. 肌肉也储存糖原为体力活动提供能量。


近义词：starch (in plants), animal starch|反义词：None.
