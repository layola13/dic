英文解析:  Noncorporation refers to the state of not being incorporated as a legal entity, such as a corporation or company.  This means the business or organization lacks the legal protections and liabilities associated with incorporation.  It often implies a simpler, less formal structure, but also potentially greater personal liability for the owners or members.
