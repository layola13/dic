The word "kyosada" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a proper noun, possibly a surname or a place name from a specific language or culture (possibly Japanese).  Without further context, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide the requested information, more context is needed, for example:

* **Origin:** Where did you encounter this word?
* **Context:** What was the sentence or paragraph in which it appeared?


Once this information is provided, I can attempt to provide a more accurate analysis, including pronunciation, part of speech, meaning, usage, and etymology.
