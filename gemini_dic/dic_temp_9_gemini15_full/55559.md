词源:  The word "distrustful" is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of"), the noun "trust," and the suffix "-ful" (meaning "full of" or "characterized by").  Therefore, "distrustful" literally means "full of distrust" or "characterized by a lack of trust."  The root "trust" itself has Old English origins.
