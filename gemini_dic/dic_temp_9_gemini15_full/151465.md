词源:  From Late Latin *parousia, from Greek παρουσία (parousía), from παρεῖναι (pareînai) "to be present," from παρά (pará) "beside, near" + εἶναι (eînai) "to be."  The Greek word was used to describe the presence or arrival of a person of importance, particularly a ruler or deity.  Its use in Christian theology to refer to the Second Coming of Christ solidified its meaning.
