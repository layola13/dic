词源:

The word "disclaiming" comes from the verb "disclaim," which is formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") to the verb "claim."  "Claim" originates from the Old French word "clamer" meaning "to shout" or "to cry out," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "clamare" with the same meaning.  Thus, "disclaim" originally meant "to cry out against" or "to deny," and its modern meaning evolved from this.
