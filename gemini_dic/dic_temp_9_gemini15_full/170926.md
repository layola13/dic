pseudomorphous:/ˌsuːdəˈmɔːrfəs/| adj.| 假形的；异质同形的 |  A pseudomorphous mineral is one that has the outward form of a different mineral.  It retains the shape of the original mineral, but its chemical composition and internal structure are different. This typically occurs when one mineral replaces another through processes like chemical alteration or replacement. For example, a crystal of pyrite might be replaced by quartz, resulting in a quartz pseudomorph after pyrite. The quartz will retain the cubic shape of the original pyrite crystal.|例句：The sample showed a clear pseudomorphous replacement of calcite by quartz.  这个样本显示了方解石被石英假象置换的清晰迹象。

The fossilized shell retained its original shape but was pseudomorphous, composed entirely of pyrite.  这个化石贝壳保留了原来的形状，但却是假形的，完全由黄铁矿组成。|近义词：false-formed, mimetic|反义词：authigenic,  genuine (in the context of mineral formation)


USAGE->

This word is primarily used as an adjective in geology and mineralogy, so tense conjugation isn't directly applicable in the same way as with verbs.  However, we can illustrate its use in different contexts:

Present Simple:  The mineral is pseudomorphous after pyrite.  这种矿物是黄铁矿假象。

Past Simple: The geologist determined that the specimen was pseudomorphous. 地质学家确定标本是假形的。

Future Simple: We expect the analysis to show the sample is pseudomorphous. 我们预计分析将显示样品是假形的。


PHRASE->

Pseudomorphous replacement: 假象置换 (a key phrase in geology)
Pseudomorphous crystals: 假形晶体
Pseudomorphous after pyrite: 黄铁矿假象（specific example）
Pseudomorphous quartz after calcite: 方解石假象石英（specific example）
Pseudomorphous structures: 假形构造


WORD ORIGIN->

The word "pseudomorphous" comes from the Greek words:

* **pseudo- (ψευδο-)**: meaning "false" or "falsely"
* **morph- (μορφή)**: meaning "form" or "shape"
* **-ous**: a suffix indicating "full of" or "having the nature of"


Therefore, pseudomorphous literally means "having a false form" or "having a form that is deceptive".
