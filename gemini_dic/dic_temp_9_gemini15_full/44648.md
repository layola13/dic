The word "croylstone" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or established linguistic resources.  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (like a place name or brand name), or a neologism (newly coined word).  To provide the requested analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?**  Knowing the source (book, website, conversation) would help determine its meaning and potential origins.
* **What is the surrounding text?**  The words before and after "croylstone" might provide clues to its meaning.

Without this information, I cannot offer an analysis including pronunciation, word class, translation, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical examples.
