词源:

The word "crooner" emerged in the 1930s, during the heyday of the "Great American Songbook" era. It's an agentive noun formed from the verb "croon," meaning to hum or sing softly and in a low, gentle voice.  The exact origin of "croon" itself is uncertain, but it's likely related to Old Norse or Old English words suggesting a soft, murmuring sound.  The association with a specific style of singing solidified during the period when famous singers like Bing Crosby popularized this intimate vocal approach.
