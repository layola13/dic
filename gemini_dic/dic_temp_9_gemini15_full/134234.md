词源:
The word "noninertness" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the word "inertness."  "Inertness" comes from the adjective "inert," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "iners," meaning "idle," "sluggish," or "unproductive."  Therefore, "noninertness" literally means "not being idle, sluggish, or unproductive," in a chemical or physical context.
