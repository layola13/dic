The word "scise" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
2. **It's a neologism or jargon:** It might be a newly coined word, a technical term in a specific field, or slang.  If so, please provide context (where you encountered this word).
3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or place name.  Again, context would be helpful.


Please provide more information so I can assist you effectively.
