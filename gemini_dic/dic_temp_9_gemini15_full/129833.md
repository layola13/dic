non-heuristic: /ˌnɒn hjuːˈrɪstɪk/ | adj. | 非启发式的；非试探法的 | Not relying on or using a heuristic;  systematic and exhaustive rather than relying on educated guesses or intuition.  It implies a methodical, step-by-step approach, often algorithmic, in contrast to a heuristic approach which prioritizes efficiency and finding a good enough solution over finding the optimal solution. | Example:  The non-heuristic algorithm explored every possible solution before arriving at the optimal result.  This contrasts with a heuristic approach which might find a good solution quickly, but not necessarily the best one. | 近义词: systematic, algorithmic, exhaustive, deterministic | 反义词: heuristic, intuitive, guesswork, trial-and-error
