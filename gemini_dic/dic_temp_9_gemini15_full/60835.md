electrostatically:/ˌɪˌlɛktrəʊˈstætɪkli/| adv. | 静电地 |  Adverb describing something done or occurring by means of static electricity. It indicates that an action or process is caused by or related to electrostatic forces. | Example: The particles were electrostatically charged, causing them to repel each other.  粒子带静电，导致它们互相排斥。 |近义词：electrically (in some contexts), statically|反义词：dynamically, magnetically
