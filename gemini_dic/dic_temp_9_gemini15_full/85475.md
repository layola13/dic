词源:  The word "hassel" is believed to be of uncertain origin, possibly an alteration of "hasel" (hazel), referring to a difficult or tangled situation.  Alternatively, some suggest a connection to the Old English word "hasu," meaning "rough, coarse."  Its usage as a noun implying trouble solidified in the late 20th century.
