词源:

The word "preadvisable" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and the adjective "advisable" (meaning "worthy of being advised; recommended").  "Advisable" itself comes from the verb "advise," ultimately derived from Old French *avisier and Latin *ad-visare ("to consider, look at").


用法说明:

preadvisable is primarily used as an adjective to describe actions or decisions that are wise or beneficial to undertake before a particular event or situation.  It emphasizes the proactive and preventative nature of the action. While "advisable" suggests something is good to do, "preadvisable" specifically highlights the importance of doing it *before* something else happens.  The word is relatively uncommon in everyday speech but may be found in formal writing or specialized contexts.
