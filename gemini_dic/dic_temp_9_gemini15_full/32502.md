词源:

The word "chinning" derives directly from "chin," referring to the act of using one's chin to support oneself, and the suffix "-ing" indicating a gerund or present participle, describing the action of doing so.  The connection to "chin-up" is clear, though "chinning" often implies a more general sense of lifting oneself using the chin and arms, not necessarily requiring a full "chin-up" motion.
