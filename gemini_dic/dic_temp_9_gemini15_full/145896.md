overdifferentiation: /ˌoʊvərˌdɪfərənʃiˈeɪʃən/ | n. |过度分化，过度区别|The excessive differentiation or specialization of cells, tissues, or organs beyond what is normally expected or necessary.  It can lead to inefficient or maladaptive outcomes.  This term is primarily used in biology, particularly in developmental biology and pathology.| Example: Overdifferentiation of the immune system can result in autoimmune diseases.  过度分化的免疫系统会导致自身免疫性疾病。|近义词: hyperdifferentiation, excessive specialization |反义词: underdifferentiation, lack of specialization|
