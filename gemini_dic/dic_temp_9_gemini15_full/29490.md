词源:

The word "catapult" ultimately derives from the Late Latin word *catapulta, which itself is likely of Greek origin, possibly from  καταπέλτης (katapeltēs), meaning "a throwing machine".  The Greek word combines κατά (kata), meaning "down," and πάλλω (pallō), meaning "to shake" or "to brandish."  Thus, the original meaning suggests a machine that throws things downwards, a feature common to many ancient catapults.
