/ˌhaɪpərnɔːrmælnəsɪz/ | n. | 超常态性 |  Hypernormality refers to a state where the seemingly normal is actually a façade concealing underlying chaos, dysfunction, or abnormality.  It's a condition where accepted norms are dramatically different from what one might expect given the circumstances, often characterized by a deceptive appearance of order and stability.  It's a concept exploring the gap between perception and reality, suggesting that what appears normal might be profoundly abnormal.
