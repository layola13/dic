词源:
The word "continue" comes from the Old French word "continuer," which in turn derives from the Latin word "continuare," meaning "to join together," "to unite," or "to connect."  The Latin root is "continuus," meaning "continuous," "uninterrupted."  This reflects the core meaning of the English word – to maintain something without interruption or break.
