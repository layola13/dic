The word "extinguishment" comes from the verb "extinguish," which itself has origins in Late Latin *extinguere. This word is a compound of *ex- (out, from) and *stinguere (to put out, extinguish).  The "-ment" suffix denotes the process or result of the action.  Therefore, "extinguishment" literally means "the act of putting out from."
