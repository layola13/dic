/ˌhaɪpərˈnɔːrməlniːs/ | n. | 超常态 | The state or condition of being hypernormal; a situation where the normal is so distorted or extreme that it appears abnormal, yet is accepted as normal.

The constant stream of misinformation and contradictory narratives created a hypernormal state. | 近义词：surreality, unreality, absurdity | 反义词：normality, regularity, ordinariness
