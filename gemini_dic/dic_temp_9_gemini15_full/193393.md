seirospore: /ˈsaɪrəʊspɔːr/ | n. | 四分孢子 | A meiospore produced during sexual reproduction in certain fungi and algae, specifically one of four spores formed within a single sporangium.  It is a type of asexual spore produced by some fungi and algae following meiosis. Seirospores are typically haploid and are involved in the dispersal of the organism. | Example: The fungus produced seirospores that were easily dispersed by the wind.  真菌产生了易于被风传播的四分孢子。| 近义词: meiospore, tetraspore | 反义词:  (无明确反义词，可考虑与产生无性孢子的过程相关的词，如mitospore) |  词性: 名词


USAGE->
This word is highly specialized and doesn't lend itself to typical grammatical tense usage examples like "hello".  The usage is primarily descriptive within the context of mycology and phycology (the study of fungi and algae, respectively).


PHRASE->

* "the formation of seirospores in *Chlamydomonas* species"  (在衣藻属物种中四分孢子的形成)
* "the dispersal mechanism of seirospores" (四分孢子的传播机制)
* "the genetic diversity of seirospores" (四分孢子的遗传多样性)
* "observation of mature seirospores under a microscope" (在显微镜下观察成熟的四分孢子)
* "seirospore development and germination" (四分孢子的发育和萌发)
