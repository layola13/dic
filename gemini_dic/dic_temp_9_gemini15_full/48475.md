词源:
The word is formed from "deep-rooted," meaning having roots that go deep, combined with the suffix "-ness," which forms nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.  "Root" itself has a long history, deriving from Proto-Germanic *wrōt-, ultimately reflecting a sense of "something that grows" or "origin".  The "deep" intensifies the meaning of the root, suggesting something firmly established and difficult to change.
