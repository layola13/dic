The word "daker" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  If you can provide context (a sentence where you encountered it, for example), I might be able to guess what word was intended.
* **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name (person, place, or thing) or a brand name.
* **It's slang or jargon:**  It could be a word used within a specific community or field, not widely known.
* **It's a neologism:** It might be a newly coined word not yet established in common usage.


Please provide more information so I can help you.
