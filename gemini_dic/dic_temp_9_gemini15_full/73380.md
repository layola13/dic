反义词：unprepared, improvident, shortsighted, unprepared


词源：The word "forehanded" is a compound of "fore-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and "handed" (originally meaning "delivered" or "given").  The sense of being prepared evolved from the idea of having something ready in advance.  While the exact etymology is complex and lacks a clear single origin point in early English texts, its development is consistent with a gradual shift in meaning from a more literal sense of "giving in advance" to the current figurative meaning of preparedness.
