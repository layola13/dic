The word "over-morally" does not exist as a standard English word.  It appears to be a newly coined or invented term, possibly combining "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great extent) with "morally" (relating to moral principles).  Therefore, providing a detailed analysis in the requested format is impossible.  To attempt to analyze it would be speculative and misleading.

If you intended to use a different word or phrase, please provide the correct term.  If you meant to create a new word, please provide context and intended meaning so I can offer suggestions or explanations.
