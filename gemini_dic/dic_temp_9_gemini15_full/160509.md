词源:
The word "pore" in this context ultimately derives from the Old French word "porer," meaning "to think intently," which in turn has roots in Latin "porare," meaning "to consider" or "to ponder."  The modern English use of "pore over" reflects this original focus on intense mental engagement with something.
