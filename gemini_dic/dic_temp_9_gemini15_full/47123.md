词源:  The word "dauntlessness" is derived from the verb "daunt," meaning to intimidate or discourage.  The suffix "-less" indicates the absence of something, in this case, the absence of being daunted.  Therefore, "dauntlessness" signifies the lack of fear or discouragement.  The word's origins trace back to Old French "douter," meaning "to doubt," and ultimately to Latin "dubitare," with the same meaning.  The addition of the negative suffix "-less" created the positive sense of fearlessness.
