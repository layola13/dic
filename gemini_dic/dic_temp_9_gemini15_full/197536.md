词源:
The word "shellac" ultimately derives from the Hindi word *śelākh*, ultimately from Sanskrit *śalākā* meaning "lac stick".  The resin is secreted by lac insects, and was historically sold in stick form.  The word's journey reflects the historical trade routes that brought this resin to the West.
