词源:

The word "in-grainedness" is formed from the adjective "ingrained" plus the suffix "-ness," which creates a noun indicating a state or quality. "Ingrained" itself comes from the past participle of the verb "ingrain," meaning "to fix firmly or deeply in the mind or nature."  "Ingrain" ultimately derives from the Old English "in-græfan," meaning "to engrave."  The "in-" prefix suggests "into" or "within," indicating something embedded deeply.
