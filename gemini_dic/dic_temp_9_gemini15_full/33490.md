It works by measuring the time it takes for a specific volume of fluid to flow through a capillary tube or other calibrated orifice. Different designs exist, each with its own method of measurement and application.  | Example: The scientist used a chyometer to determine the viscosity of the newly synthesized polymer.  科学家用测粘度仪测定新合成的聚合物的粘度。 | 近义词：viscometer | 反义词：无 |  n.
