oscillaria:/ˌɒsɪləˈeəriə/ | n. |颤藻属；奥西拉里亚属 | Oscillatoria is a genus of filamentous cyanobacteria.  They are commonly found in freshwater and marine environments, forming blooms under certain conditions.  They are photosynthetic and can be important primary producers in aquatic ecosystems. | 例句：Oscillatoria species are often found in eutrophic lakes. 颤藻属物种通常存在于富营养化湖泊中。 | 例句：The bloom of Oscillatoria was visible as a green scum on the water's surface.  颤藻的爆发在水面上可见为一层绿色浮渣。 | 近义词：cyanobacteria (更广泛的术语) | 反义词：无
