The word "cholaemaa" is not a word found in standard English dictionaries or any known language.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a fictional language, or a word specific to a very niche context.  If you could provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more informed response.
