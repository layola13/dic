electropoion:/ˌɪˌlɛktrəˈpoɪən/| n. |电解池|An electropoion is an electrolytic cell used for the electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.  It typically consists of two electrodes (anode and cathode) immersed in an electrolyte solution, usually water with an added electrolyte to increase conductivity.  When an electric current is passed through the cell, water molecules are decomposed into hydrogen gas at the cathode and oxygen gas at the anode.|Example:  The scientist used an electropoion to demonstrate the process of electrolysis.|近义词：electrolytic cell, water electrolyzer|反义词：N/A
