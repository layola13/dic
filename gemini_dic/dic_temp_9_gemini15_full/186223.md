rhinencephalon:/ˌraɪnɛnˈsɛfəlɒn/| n. |嗅脑|The rhinencephalon is a part of the brain involved in olfaction (smell) and related functions. It's an older part of the brain, phylogenetically, and is less developed in humans compared to other animals with a stronger sense of smell.  It includes structures like the olfactory bulb, olfactory tract, and parts of the limbic system.  The functions extend beyond just smell, influencing emotions, memory, and behavior.|The rhinencephalon plays a crucial role in processing olfactory information and its connections to the limbic system highlight its significance in emotional responses.|近义词: olfactory brain, limbic system (partially)|反义词: (no direct antonym)|
