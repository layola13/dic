The word "cruth" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information according to the requested format.  It's likely a misspelling, a word from a very obscure dialect, or a neologism (newly coined word).  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, it might be possible to offer a more helpful response.
