词源:
The word "confraternity" comes from the Late Middle English word "confraternite," which itself is derived from Old French "confraternité."  The Old French term is a combination of "con-" (meaning "together" or "with") and "fraternité" (meaning "brotherhood").  Ultimately, the word traces back to the Latin word "frater," meaning "brother."  Therefore, the word literally means "brotherhood together" or "association of brothers."
