preextended:/priːɪkˈstɛndɪd/ | adj. | 预先延长的；提前延长的 |  The word "preextended" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It appears to be a newly coined word or a very rarely used one, formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") with "extended" (meaning "lengthened" or "prolonged").  Therefore, its meaning is inferred from its constituent parts: something that has been extended or lengthened beforehand or in advance.  | Example: The deadline was preextended to allow for unforeseen circumstances. (这个截止日期提前延长以应对不可预见的情况。) | 近义词: pre-extended, advanced, beforehand | 反义词: shortened, reduced, curtailed |  adj.
