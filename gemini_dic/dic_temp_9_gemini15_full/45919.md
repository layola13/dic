词源:

The word "cutter" comes from the Old English word "cuttan," meaning "to cut."  The noun form developed naturally from the verb, describing something or someone that performs the action of cutting.  Its various meanings (tool, person, ship) emerged through metaphorical extension of the core idea of cutting.
