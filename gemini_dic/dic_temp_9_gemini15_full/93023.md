词源:
The word "idiotish" is derived from the word "idiot," which ultimately comes from the Ancient Greek word "ἰδιώτης" (idiōtēs), meaning "private person," "layman," or "one who is not a professional." In ancient Greece, the term referred to someone who was not involved in public life. Over time, the meaning shifted to denote someone lacking in intelligence, leading to its modern usage.  The suffix "-ish" is added to create the adjective form, signifying a quality or characteristic.
