if you please:/ɪf juː pliːz/ | interjection | 请 |  A polite phrase used to make a request more gentle and courteous. It adds a formal and deferential tone. | Example:  "Would you pass the salt, if you please?" = "请你把盐递给我好吗？" | 近义词: please, kindly | 反义词:  (no direct antonym, the opposite would be a rude or abrupt request)


USAGE->
This phrase is an interjection, so it doesn't conjugate like verbs.  It doesn't have tenses or voices. Its usage is always the same: to politely soften a request.

Example 1: "Open the door, if you please." = "请打开门。"
Example 2: "Help me with this, if you please." = "请帮我一下。"


PHRASE->
This phrase is not typically used in larger phrases, but it can be part of a longer, more polite request. For example:

"I would be grateful if you would assist me with this task, if you please." = "如果您方便的话，请您帮我完成这项任务，我将不胜感激。"
