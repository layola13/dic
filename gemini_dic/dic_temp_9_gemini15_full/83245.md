词源:
The word "gymnastics" ultimately derives from the Greek word "gymnastikē" (γυμναστική), which itself comes from "gymnazein" (γυμνάζειν), meaning "to exercise naked" or "to train."  The ancient Greek "gymnasium" was a place for athletic training and exercise, often involving nude athletes.  The English word evolved through various stages of Latin and French before reaching its current form.
