USAGE->
This word is largely archaic and primarily used in legal contexts, so a full grammatical conjugation isn't applicable in the same way as common verbs.  The word functions primarily as a noun.  Therefore, instead of conjugations, examples will illustrate its usage in different sentence structures.


Simple Sentence:
The cognisor signed the document, transferring ownership. = 承认者签署了文件，转移了所有权。


Complex Sentence:
Because the cognisor had previously confirmed the debt, the court ruled in the creditor's favor. = 因为承认者先前已确认债务，法院判决支持债权人。


Compound Sentence:
The cognisor relinquished his claim, and the dispute was settled. = 承认者放弃了他的索赔，纠纷得到解决。
