词源:
The word "derogative" comes from the Latin word "derogare," which means "to take away," "to lessen," or "to detract from."  This reflects the sense of diminishing or lessening someone's worth or value.  The suffix "-ative" transforms the verb into an adjective.

用法说明:
Derogatory is primarily used as an adjective to describe words, phrases, remarks, or actions that express contempt, scorn, or belittlement. It's often used to indicate negative connotations or disrespectful language towards someone or something.  It implies a deliberate attempt to lessen the value or status of the target.


  The word is typically used to describe:

* **Language:**  Derogatory terms are used to insult, offend, or demean.
* **Actions:** Actions can be described as derogatory if they aim to belittle or diminish someone.
* **Remarks:** Comments that express disapproval or scorn.
* **References:** Mentions that aim to cast someone or something in a negative light.


Note that while "pejorative" is often used synonymously with "derogative,"  "pejorative" sometimes has a broader sense, encompassing any word that has acquired a negative connotation over time, even if not intentionally used to insult.  "Derogative," however, usually implies a conscious intention to demean.
