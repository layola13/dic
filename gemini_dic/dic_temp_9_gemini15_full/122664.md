modularity:/ˌmɒdʒʊˈlærɪti/ /ˌmɑːdʒʊˈlærɪti/ | n. | 模块化；模块性 | The property of being composed of separate, interchangeable modules.  Modularity allows for flexibility, maintainability, and scalability in systems.  For example, a modular building is constructed from prefabricated units that can be easily assembled and reconfigured. | The software exhibits high modularity, making it easy to update and maintain.  这个软件具有高度的模块化，易于更新和维护。

The car's design features excellent modularity, allowing for easy customization. 这款车的设计具有极佳的模块化，便于定制。| 近义词：modularity, componentization, segmentation | 反义词：monolithic, integration


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The system demonstrates high modularity. = 这个系统展现出高度的模块化。
This design prioritizes modularity. = 这个设计优先考虑模块化。


一般过去时:

将来时:
We will improve the system's modularity in the next update. = 我们将在下一次更新中改进系统的模块化。
They will adopt a modular design for the new product. = 他们将为新产品采用模块化设计。


虚拟语气:
If the system had better modularity, it would be easier to maintain. = 如果系统具有更好的模块化，维护起来就会更容易。
It would be beneficial if we increased the modularity of the software. = 如果我们提高软件的模块化，将会有益。


被动语态:
Modularity was implemented throughout the project. = 模块化贯穿了整个项目。

否定句:
The system does not have sufficient modularity. = 该系统模块化不足。
They did not initially consider modularity in the design. = 他们最初的设计中没有考虑模块化。


PHRASE->
high modularity 高度模块化
system modularity 系统模块化
software modularity 软件模块化
design modularity 设计模块化
increase modularity 提高模块化


词源:
The word "modularity" is derived from the word "module," which comes from the Latin word "modulus," meaning "a small measure" or "unit."  The suffix "-arity" indicates a quality or state. Therefore, modularity refers to the quality or state of being composed of modules.
