词源:
The word "mesmerization" derives from the name of Franz Mesmer (1734-1815), an Austrian physician who developed a system of treatment known as "mesmerism," which involved inducing a trance-like state in patients through the use of magnets and suggestion.  While his methods are now considered pseudoscience, the term "mesmerize" and its related forms persist to describe the captivating and hypnotic effect he purported to achieve.
