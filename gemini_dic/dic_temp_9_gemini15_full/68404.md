falseness's:/ˈfɔːlsnəsɪz/| n.|虚假；虚伪；不真实|The falseness of his claims was readily apparent.  他的说法虚假之处显而易见。|近义词：falsehood, deception, sham, artificiality|反义词：truth, genuineness, authenticity|名词


The word "falseness's" is a somewhat unusual form.  It's the genitive (possessive) form of "falseness," meaning it indicates possession or belonging.  However, because "falseness" itself is an abstract noun, using the possessive form can sound awkward in many contexts.  It's generally better to rephrase the sentence to avoid this construction.

英文解析:The word "falseness" refers to the quality or state of being false, untrue, or insincere.  It suggests a lack of genuineness or authenticity.  Adding the possessive 's creates a possessive form, indicating something belongs to or is associated with falseness.  For example, "the falseness's impact" might refer to the effect of the falseness itself. However, such usage is uncommon and often replaced with alternative phrasing.

例句:

The falseness's influence on the relationship was undeniable. 虚假对这段关系的影响是不可否认的。(Better phrasing: The influence of falseness on the relationship was undeniable.)

The falseness's revelation shocked everyone. 虚假的真相震惊了所有人。(Better phrasing: The revelation of the falseness shocked everyone.)


近义词：falsehood's, deception's, sham's, artificiality's (all possessive forms, and similarly awkward in most contexts)


反义词：truth's, genuineness's, authenticity's (again, possessive forms, and generally better rephrased)

词性：名词 (possessive form)
