WORD ORIGIN->

The word "interavailabilities" is a relatively modern coinage formed through the combination of several morphemes:

* **inter-**:  A prefix meaning "between," "among," or "reciprocally."
* **avail**:  A verb meaning "to be of use or service," or a noun referring to use or benefit.  Its root traces back to Old French "availler" (to profit, help).
* **-able**: A suffix that means "capable of" or "worthy of."
* **-ity**: A suffix creating abstract nouns, indicating a state, quality, or condition.
* **-ies**: A plural suffix for nouns ending in -y.

Therefore, the word literally means "the qualities or states of being mutually usable or beneficial between things."
