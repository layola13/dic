词源:
The phrase "lean in" gained popularity through Sheryl Sandberg's book "Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead," published in 2013.  While the phrase itself isn't of ancient origin, its component parts ("lean" and "in") are,  referring to physical postures and movement.  Sandberg's usage however, gave it a metaphorical meaning of active engagement and participation, particularly in the workplace and in achieving one's ambitions.
