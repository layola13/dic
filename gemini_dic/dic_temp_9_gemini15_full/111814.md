logarithmically:/ˌlɒɡəˈrɪðmɪkli/|/ˌlɑːɡəˈrɪðmɪkli/| adj.| 对数地；成对数地 |  Describes a relationship or process that changes proportionally to the logarithm of another variable.  It indicates a gradual, diminishing rate of change.  | The intensity of the sound decreased logarithmically with distance from the source.  声音强度随着距离声源的距离成对数递减。| exponentially, geometrically | linearly, arithmetically |


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The intensity decreases logarithmically with distance. = 强度随距离对数递减。
The value changes logarithmically over time. = 值随时间对数变化。


一般过去时:
The signal strength decreased logarithmically yesterday. = 信号强度昨天对数递减。
The population grew logarithmically in the past decade. = 人口在过去十年中对数增长。


现在完成时:
The temperature has decreased logarithmically. = 温度已经对数下降。
The company's growth has been logarithmic. = 公司的增长一直是指数增长的(这里用logarithmic略有不妥，应为exponential)。


过去完成时:
The pressure had decreased logarithmically before the experiment concluded. = 在实验结束前，压力已经对数下降。
The system had evolved logarithmically by that point. = 到那时，系统已经对数演化。


将来时:
The value will decrease logarithmically in the future. = 未来该值将对数递减。
The algorithm's complexity will grow logarithmically with input size. = 算法的复杂度将随着输入大小对数增长。


虚拟语气:
If the growth were logarithmic, the model would be simpler. = 如果增长是对数的，模型就会更简单。
I wish the decay were logarithmic instead of exponential. = 我希望衰减是对数的而不是指数的。


被动语态:
The data was analyzed logarithmically. = 数据被对数分析。
The results were plotted logarithmically. = 结果被对数作图。


疑问句:
Does the function increase logarithmically? = 这个函数是对数增长的吗？
Is the relationship logarithmically proportional? = 关系是对数成正比的吗？


否定句:
The relationship is not logarithmically scaled. = 关系不是对数刻度的。
The growth did not proceed logarithmically. = 增长并非对数进行的。


PHRASE->
logarithmic scale 对数刻度
logarithmic function 对数函数
logarithmic growth 对数增长
logarithmic decrement 对数衰减
logarithmically spaced 对数间隔
