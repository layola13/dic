gynandromorphism:/ˌɡaɪnænˈdrɒmɔːrfɪzəm/|/ˌɡaɪnænˈdrɑːmɔːrfɪzəm/| n. |雌雄嵌合体；雌雄同体 |Gynandromorphism is a rare genetic condition in which an organism has both male and female characteristics. This is usually due to a mutation during early development where some cells have XX chromosomes and others have XY chromosomes.  The resulting organism exhibits a mosaic of male and female traits, often in a bilateral pattern. |Example: The butterfly displayed gynandromorphism, with one half of its body exhibiting male coloration and the other half female coloration.  这只蝴蝶表现出雌雄嵌合体现象，身体的一半呈现雄性颜色，另一半呈现雌性颜色。|近义词：bilateral gynandromorphy, sexual dimorphism (partially)|反义词：monosexuality, complete sexual uniformity
