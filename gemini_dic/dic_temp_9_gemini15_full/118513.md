mesocaecum: /ˌmɛsoʊˈsiːkəm/ | n. |盲肠中段|The mesocolon is the part of the peritoneum that attaches the colon to the posterior abdominal wall.  The mesoappendix is a peritoneal fold that attaches the appendix to the cecum. The term "mesocaecum" refers specifically to the mesentery of the cecum, the pouch-like first part of the large intestine.  It is a double-layered peritoneal fold that supports and attaches the cecum to the posterior abdominal wall.  This structure provides the cecum with its blood supply and lymphatic drainage.  |Example: The surgical approach involved carefully dissecting the mesocolon to access the underlying structures. The inflammation of the mesocolon was a serious complication.|近义词: mesentery (more general term)|反义词: None.
