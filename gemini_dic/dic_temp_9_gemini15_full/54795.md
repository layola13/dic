词源:
Derived from the word "dispensatory,"  meaning a place where things are dispensed, specifically referring to pharmacies in the past. "Dispensatory" itself comes from the verb "dispense," from Latin "dispensare," meaning "to weigh out," "distribute," or "deal out."  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective or noun into an adverb.
