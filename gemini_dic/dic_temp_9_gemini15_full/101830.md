irrotational:/ˌɪrəʊteɪʃənəl/ | adj. | 无旋的，势函数的 |  Describing a vector field where the curl is zero everywhere.  This means that the field is conservative, and can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar potential function.  In simpler terms, it implies no rotation or swirling within the field. | Example: The velocity field of an ideal fluid is often modeled as irrotational.  无旋的：理想流体的速度场通常被建模为无旋的。The gravitational field is an example of an irrotational field. 万有引力场是无旋场的例子。|近义词：conservative, potential | 反义词：rotational


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in physics, fluid dynamics, and vector calculus.  Therefore, tense usage depends heavily on the context of the scientific explanation or problem being described.  There's no straightforward conjugation like with common verbs.

Example sentence demonstrating different tenses within a physics problem:

Present Simple: The fluid flow *is* irrotational in this region.  此区域内的流体流动是无旋的。
Present Continuous:  We are currently analyzing whether the flow *is remaining* irrotational. 我们目前正在分析流动是否保持无旋。
Past Simple: The experiment showed that the field *was* irrotational under those conditions. 实验表明，在那些条件下，该场是无旋的。
Past Perfect:  The researchers had assumed the flow *had been* irrotational, but the data proved otherwise. 研究人员曾假设流动是无旋的，但数据证明并非如此。
Future Simple: The simulation predicts that the field *will be* irrotational at high speeds. 模拟预测，在高速下该场将是无旋的。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "irrotational".  Its usage is restricted to technical contexts.  The following phrases could describe situations where irrotationality is relevant:

irrotational flow: 无旋流动
irrotational vector field: 无旋向量场
irrotational velocity field: 无旋速度场
irrotational fluid motion: 无旋流体运动
Laplacian of a scalar potential: 数量势的拉普拉斯算子 (related to irrotational fields)


词源:
The word is formed from the prefix "ir-" (meaning "not"), "rotation" (the act of rotating), and the suffix "-al" (forming an adjective).  Therefore, it literally means "not rotating".
