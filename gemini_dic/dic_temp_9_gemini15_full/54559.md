dislocative:/dɪsˈloʊkətɪv/ | adj. | 脱位的；错位的；位错的 | Relating to or causing dislocation; characterized by dislocation.  The term often refers to geological or crystallographic structures, but can also apply to anatomical structures. |例句：The geologist studied the dislocative features of the fault line.  地质学家研究了断层线的错位特征。

The patient suffered a dislocative injury to the shoulder. 病人肩膀受到了脱位伤。| 近义词：displaced, misaligned, fractured (in the context of bones)| 反义词：aligned, in place, properly positioned | 词性：形容词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The fault exhibits dislocative features. = 断层表现出错位特征。
This mechanism is dislocative in nature. = 这种机制本质上是错位的。


一般过去时:
The earthquake caused dislocative damage. = 地震造成了错位破坏。

现在完成时:
Geologists have identified several dislocative zones. = 地质学家已经确定了几个错位区域。
The analysis has revealed a dislocative pattern in the crystal structure. = 分析揭示了晶体结构中的错位模式。


过去完成时:
Before the impact, the structure had already shown dislocative signs. = 在撞击之前，结构已经显示出错位迹象。
They had previously observed similar dislocative patterns in other samples. = 他们之前在其他样品中观察到类似的错位模式。


将来时:
The new analysis will likely reveal further dislocative features. = 新的分析可能会揭示更多错位特征。
Further research will investigate the dislocative processes involved. = 进一步的研究将调查所涉及的错位过程。


虚拟语气:
If the stress were greater, more dislocative events would occur. = 如果压力更大，就会发生更多错位事件。
We wish the material hadn't shown such pronounced dislocative behavior. = 我们希望材料没有表现出如此明显的错位行为。


被动语态:
Dislocative structures were identified using advanced imaging techniques. = 使用先进的成像技术识别了错位结构。
The fault line is believed to have been formed by dislocative processes. = 人们认为断层线是由错位过程形成的。


疑问句:
Are there any dislocative effects visible in the image? = 图像中是否可见任何错位效应？
What are the primary causes of this dislocative deformation? = 这种错位变形的根本原因是什么？


否定句:
The sample showed no significant dislocative characteristics. = 样本没有显示出任何明显的错位特征。
This type of bonding does not usually result in dislocative structures. = 这种类型的键合通常不会导致错位结构。
