fail-safing: /ˈfeɪlˌseɪfɪŋ/ | n. |失效安全机制；故障安全设计 | The process of designing or implementing systems or processes that prevent catastrophic failure or mitigate the consequences of failure.  It involves incorporating redundant components, backup systems, and safety measures to ensure continued operation or minimal damage in the event of a primary system failure. | Example: The aircraft's fail-safing mechanisms prevented a complete engine failure from causing a crash.  飞机的失效安全机制防止了发动机完全失效导致坠毁。 The software includes fail-safing features to protect data in case of a power outage.  该软件包括失效安全功能，以在停电的情况下保护数据。 | 近义词：redundancy, backup, safety mechanism, fault tolerance | 反义词：failure, vulnerability


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The system's fail-safing features are constantly monitored. = 系统的失效安全功能正在不断监控中。
Fail-safing is crucial for critical infrastructure. = 失效安全对关键基础设施至关重要。


一般过去时:
Engineers implemented fail-safing measures after the accident. = 事故发生后，工程师们实施了失效安全措施。
The fail-safing system successfully prevented a major disaster. = 失效安全系统成功地避免了一场重大灾难。


现在完成时:
They have improved the fail-safing protocols significantly. = 他们已经大大改进了失效安全协议。
We have incorporated multiple layers of fail-safing. = 我们已经加入了多层失效安全机制。


过去完成时:
The fail-safing system had already engaged before the complete power failure. = 在完全断电之前，失效安全系统已经启动了。
They had designed the fail-safing measures with redundancy in mind. = 他们在设计失效安全措施时考虑到了冗余性。


将来时:
We will implement new fail-safing mechanisms next year. = 我们明年将实施新的失效安全机制。
The company will improve its fail-safing procedures. = 公司将改进其失效安全程序。


虚拟语气:
If the fail-safing system hadn't worked, the consequences would have been devastating. = 如果失效安全系统没有发挥作用，后果将是灾难性的。
It is crucial that fail-safing measures are in place. = 失效安全措施到位至关重要。


被动语态:
Fail-safing measures are being implemented across the company. = 失效安全措施正在公司范围内实施。
The system was designed with fail-safing in mind. = 该系统在设计时就考虑到了失效安全。


疑问句:
What fail-safing procedures are in place? = 已经实施了哪些失效安全程序？
Are fail-safing mechanisms sufficient for this application? = 对于此应用程序，失效安全机制是否足够？


否定句:
The system lacked adequate fail-safing. = 该系统缺乏足够的失效安全机制。
The software did not include any fail-safing features. = 该软件不包含任何失效安全功能。
