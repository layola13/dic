词源:

The word "intransmutability" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the word "transmutable" (meaning "capable of being changed or transformed"), and the suffix "-ity" (meaning "the state or quality of").  "Transmutable" itself comes from "transmute" (to change in form or nature) which has roots in Latin "trans" (across, beyond) and "mutare" (to change).  Therefore, "intransmutability" literally means "the state of not being capable of being changed or transformed".
