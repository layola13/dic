词源:  The word "louche" comes from the French adjective "louche," meaning "squinting," "slanting," or "oblique."  This original meaning gradually evolved to encompass a sense of moral ambiguity and questionable behavior, likely due to the association of squinting eyes with deceit or hidden intentions.  Its adoption into English reflects the borrowing of many words related to sophisticated or decadent lifestyles from French.
