词源:
The word "pretzel" is believed to have originated from the Latin word "pretiola," meaning "little reward."  It evolved through various forms in German (e.g., "brezel," "bretzel") before entering English.  The twisted shape of the pretzel might have symbolized clasped hands in prayer or arms of a child.
