The word "pakeha" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's a Māori word. Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible, as it requires a different approach than analyzing a standard English word.  I can, however, provide information about the word within its cultural context.


pakeha: /ˈpɑːkeɪhɑː/ | n. | (毛利语)欧洲白人；非毛利人 | A term used by Māori people in New Zealand to refer to people of European descent.  The precise origin and meaning are debated, but it's generally understood as a descriptor rather than a derogatory term, although its use can be sensitive depending on context and tone.  The word itself carries a complex history interwoven with the colonization of New Zealand.  Its usage varies across different Māori communities and individuals.  Some prefer it, others find it problematic.


例句:
He is a pakeha living in Auckland. = 他是住在奥克兰的一个欧洲白人。

Many pakeha have embraced the Māori culture. = 许多欧洲白人都接受了毛利文化。
