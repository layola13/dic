pre-Indians:/ˌpriːˈɪndiənz/| n. |印第安人之前的居民|  The term "pre-Indians" refers to the populations inhabiting the Americas before the arrival of European colonizers and the groups commonly referred to as Native Americans or Indigenous peoples.  The term is considered outdated and potentially inaccurate because it implies a linear progression of cultures, ignoring the diverse and long history of human settlement in the Americas.  It is crucial to understand that various groups of people inhabited the Americas for tens of thousands of years before European contact, and their cultures and histories were complex and varied. The term is often avoided in academic and professional settings in favor of more precise and respectful terminology that reflects the diversity of pre-Columbian cultures.|The existence of pre-Columbian civilizations challenges the simplistic narrative of "Indians" arriving in a previously uninhabited land. |近义词:pre-Columbian peoples, Paleo-Indians, early Americans|反义词:None  (The antonym would describe the later arrival of European colonizers and their descendants.)|名词
