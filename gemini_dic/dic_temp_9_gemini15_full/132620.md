/ˌnɒndɪsəˈɡriːmənts/ | n. |无分歧，一致同意 |The term "nondisagreements" is not a standard English word.  It's a neologism,  a newly coined word, formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") and "disagreements." It implies a state of complete agreement or lack of conflict. However, its unusual nature makes it less clear and less preferred than using alternative phrasing.  |There were nondisagreements among the team members regarding the project's direction. (This sentence is understandable but awkward. A better alternative would be: "The team members were in complete agreement regarding the project's direction.") |agreement, accord, consensus |disagreement, conflict, contention |n.
