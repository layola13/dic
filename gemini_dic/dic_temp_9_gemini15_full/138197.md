词源:
The word "nosedive" is a compound word.  "Nose" refers to the front part of the plane or the leading indicator, and "dive" means a steep descent.  The image is of the nose of an aircraft pointing downwards in a rapid descent.  The term emerged in aviation terminology and then extended to describe any steep decline.
