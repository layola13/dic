conchyliometry:/ˌkɒŋkɪliˈɒmɪtri/ | n. | 贝壳测量法 | The science of measuring shells, especially for taxonomic purposes.  Conchyliometry involves precise measurements of shell dimensions to aid in species identification and classification.  This technique is particularly useful in paleontology, where complete specimens may be rare. | The conchyliometry study revealed subtle differences in shell morphology between the two species. 贝壳测量法研究揭示了这两个物种之间贝壳形态的细微差异。 | 近义词：shell measurement,  shell analysis | 反义词：无
