词源:
From *dumb* + *-ly*.  "Dumb" itself has a complex etymology, ultimately deriving from Proto-Germanic *dumba- ("mute, silent"), related to Old English *dumb ("mute, silent"), Old High German *tump ("mute, dull"), and Old Norse *dumbr ("mute, dull").  The modern sense of "stupid" is a later development.
