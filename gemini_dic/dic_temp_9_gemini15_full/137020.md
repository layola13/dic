词源:
The word "nonstandardization" is a combination of "non-" (a prefix meaning "not") and "standardization" (the process of establishing standards).  "Standardization" itself comes from "standard," ultimately deriving from Old French "estandard" and Old English "stænderd," referring to a banner or flag, then broadening to mean a norm or model.
