词源:
The word "decompartmentalize" is a combination of the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse"), "compartment" (referring to a separate section or division), and the suffix "-alize" (meaning "to make or become").  Therefore, it literally means "to remove from compartments" or "to remove the compartmentalization."
