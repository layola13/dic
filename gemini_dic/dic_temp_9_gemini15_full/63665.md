epanodos:/ˌɛpəˈnɒdəs/| n. | 回环；逆行；反复| A figure of speech in which the words of a phrase or clause are repeated in reverse grammatical order.  It's a form of chiasmus, emphasizing the point by repeating the same words in a different order. | Example: "Pleasure's a sin, and sin's a pleasure." | 近义词：chiasmus,  anaphora (partially),  epistrophe (partially)| 反义词：None specifically, but contrasts with straightforward, linear phrasing. | 名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in literary analysis and rhetoric.  There's no grammatical conjugation as it's a noun describing a literary device.  It doesn't have tenses or moods like verbs. Examples illustrate its usage:

Example 1:  "Fair is foul, and foul is fair" (Shakespeare, Macbeth) - This is a classic example of epanodos, where the same terms are repeated in reversed order to highlight the contradictory nature of the situation.  This shows the ambiguity and moral inversion.

Example 2: "The wise man seeks wisdom, wisdom seeks the wise man." - This showcases the reciprocal relationship between wisdom and the wise individual.  The repetition in reverse grammatical order emphasizes the cyclical nature of the pursuit.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "epanodos" as it is a literary term rather than a common word.  However, examples of epanodos can be found in many phrases.  For example:

Example 1: "Love is blind, blind is love" - This emphasizes the all-encompassing nature of blind love.

Example 2: "Easy come, easy go." - Though a proverb not strictly following a grammatical reversal, it embodies the spirit of epanodos through the mirrored sentiment.

Example 3: "The beginning is the end, and the end is the beginning." - This is a more complex example that captures the cyclicality of time and events.

Example 4: "Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country." - While not a perfect grammatical reversal, the mirroring of the sentence structure and the core idea displays the principle of epanodos.

Example 5: "One small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." - This example, while not a perfect grammatical reversal, shows the mirroring of the grammatical structure, highlighting the contrast between the two actions.
