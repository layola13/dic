disjunctions:/dɪsˈdʒʌŋkʃənz/| n. |析取；分离；脱节 |A disjunction is a logical operation that is true if at least one of its operands is true.  It's often represented by the symbol "∨" or the word "or". In linguistics, it refers to a grammatical structure where two or more clauses or phrases are joined without a coordinating conjunction, often resulting in a sense of contrast or separation.  |Example: The sentence "He went to the store, he bought milk" shows a disjunction in its structure.  The lack of a conjunction like "and" creates a slightly jarring effect, emphasizing the separate actions.  Another example could be  "The sun was shining; the birds were singing."  The semicolon implies a disjunction, connecting two independent but separate observations. |近义词：separation, disconnection, dichotomy |反义词：conjunction, union, connection |名词
