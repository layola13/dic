词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."  This prefix indicates a resemblance or approximation, but not a complete equivalence.

* **congratulatory**: From "congratulate," derived from Latin *con* (together) + *gratulari* (to rejoice).  Meaning expressing pleasure at someone's success or good fortune.

Therefore, "quasi-congratulatory" describes something that resembles a congratulation but falls short of genuine, wholehearted praise.  It implies a mixed or ambiguous message, often containing a veiled criticism or reservation.
