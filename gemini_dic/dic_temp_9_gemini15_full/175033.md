/ˌreɪdiəʊkənˈdʌktə(r)/| n. |无线电导体|A radioconductor is a term rarely used in modern English.  It would refer to a material or device that conducts radio waves, similar to how a conductor conducts electricity.  However, the term is largely superseded by more specific and precise terminology related to radio frequency (RF) engineering.  The term might appear in older texts or highly specialized contexts.  It lacks common usage and is not found in standard dictionaries.|The old textbook mentioned a radioconductor as a key component of the early radio receiver.|近义词:  (depending on context) waveguide, antenna, transmission line|反义词:  insulator (for radio waves)


USAGE->
This word is rarely used and thus has no common grammatical usage examples.  The word would follow standard noun usage rules.  For example:

一般现在时:
The engineer studies the properties of the radioconductor. = 工程师研究无线电导体的特性。
The experiment uses a new type of radioconductor. = 实验使用了一种新型无线电导体。


一般过去时:
They tested the radioconductor's efficiency. = 他们测试了无线电导体的效率。
The old radio used a faulty radioconductor. = 那台旧收音机使用了有故障的无线电导体。


现在完成时:
Scientists have improved the design of the radioconductor. = 科学家们改进了无线电导体的设计。
We have observed interesting results with this radioconductor. = 我们观察到这种无线电导体有有趣的成果。


过去完成时:
They had already installed the radioconductor before the test. = 他们在测试之前就已经安装好了无线电导体。
The researchers had discovered a flaw in the radioconductor. = 研究人员已经发现了无线电导体的一个缺陷。


将来时:
They will install a new radioconductor next week. = 他们下周将安装一个新的无线电导体。
We will analyze the data from the radioconductor. = 我们将分析来自无线电导体的数据。


虚拟语气:
If we had a better radioconductor, the signal would be stronger. = 如果我们有一个更好的无线电导体，信号就会更强。
I wish the radioconductor were more efficient. = 我希望无线电导体更有效率。


被动语态:
The radioconductor was carefully calibrated. = 无线电导体经过仔细校准。
The signal was transmitted through the radioconductor. = 信号通过无线电导体传输。


疑问句:
Is the radioconductor properly connected? = 无线电导体连接正确吗？
What type of radioconductor is used in this device? = 此设备中使用哪种类型的无线电导体？


否定句:
The radioconductor did not function correctly. = 无线电导体没有正常工作。
The experiment did not use that type of radioconductor. = 该实验没有使用那种类型的无线电导体。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases associated with "radioconductor" due to its infrequent usage.  The word itself is largely obsolete.
