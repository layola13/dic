heliometer:/hiːliˈɒmɪtər/ | n. |测日仪，测日镜 | An instrument used to measure the apparent diameter of the sun or other celestial bodies.  It typically consists of two halves of a lens that can be moved relative to each other to measure small angular distances. | The astronomers used a heliometer to precisely measure the sun's diameter. 天文学家使用测日仪精确测量太阳的直径。|  | | noun
