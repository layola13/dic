词源:
The idiom "make heavy weather of" originated in the nautical context.  "Heavy weather" referred to a severe storm at sea.  The phrase then extended to describe any situation where someone struggles excessively with something that is not inherently difficult, thus implying they are making a bigger deal out of it than necessary.
