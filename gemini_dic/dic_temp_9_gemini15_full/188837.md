The word "rusing" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  To help you, I need either a correct spelling of the intended word or more context about where you encountered "rusing."
