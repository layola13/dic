dicyemata: /ˌdaɪsiˈeɪtə/ | n. | 迭宫虫 | Dicyemata are a phylum of microscopic, parasitic rhabdophoran worms found in the renal organs of cephalopod mollusks. They have a unique lifecycle involving multiple generations and a complex morphology.  They are characterized by their simple body plan, lacking a coelom and complete digestive system. | Example:  The research paper detailed the unusual reproductive strategies of the dicyemata found in the cuttlefish.  研究论文详细介绍了在墨鱼体内发现的迭宫虫不寻常的繁殖策略。 | 近义词:  (No close synonyms due to the unique nature of the phylum) | 反义词: (No direct antonyms) |  词性: noun
