词源:
The word "mobster" is a relatively recent addition to the English language, appearing in the early 20th century. It's a combination of "mob" and "ster," a suffix often used to form nouns.  "Mob," short for "mobile," originally referred to a disorderly crowd.  Over time, it came to specifically mean a gang of criminals. The "-ster" suffix adds a sense of agency or affiliation, turning "mob" into a person who is part of that mob.  Therefore, a "mobster" is literally a member of a criminal mob.
