parageosyncline: /ˌpærəˌdʒioʊˈsɪŋklaɪn/ | n. | 副地槽 | A parageosyncline is a relatively shallow, less intensely deformed sedimentary basin adjacent to a geosyncline.  It typically contains less volcanic material and undergoes less intense tectonic activity than a geosyncline.  Parageosynclines are considered to be transitional zones between stable continental platforms and the more active geosynclines. | Example: The Appalachian Mountains formed from the accumulation of sediments in a parageosyncline.  阿巴拉契亚山脉是由副地槽沉积物的堆积形成的。|近义词:foreland basin, miogeosyncline |反义词:geosyncline


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The parageosyncline contains a variety of sedimentary rocks. = 副地槽包含各种沉积岩。
This parageosyncline is being studied by geologists. = 地质学家正在研究这个副地槽。


一般过去时:
Geologists mapped the parageosyncline in detail. = 地质学家详细绘制了副地槽的地图。
The parageosyncline experienced significant sedimentation. = 副地槽经历了大量的沉积作用。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several fossils in the parageosyncline. = 科学家们在副地槽中发现了几个化石。
Researchers have studied the tectonic history of this parageosyncline. = 研究人员研究了这个副地槽的构造史。


过去完成时:
Before the uplift, the parageosyncline had accumulated vast amounts of sediment. = 在隆起之前，副地槽已经积累了大量的沉积物。
The parageosyncline had already begun to deform before the collision. = 在碰撞之前，副地槽已经开始变形。


将来时:
Geologists will continue to investigate this parageosyncline. = 地质学家将继续调查这个副地槽。
Further research will reveal more about the parageosyncline's formation. = 进一步的研究将揭示更多关于副地槽形成的信息。


虚拟语气:
If the parageosyncline were deeper, it would contain more volcanic material. = 如果副地槽更深，它将包含更多火山物质。
It is unlikely that the parageosyncline would have formed without tectonic activity. = 副地槽如果没有构造活动，不太可能形成。


被动语态:
The parageosyncline was formed by the accumulation of sediments. = 副地槽是由沉积物的堆积形成的。
The age of the parageosyncline is being determined using radiometric dating. = 副地槽的年龄正在使用放射性测年法确定。


疑问句:
What type of rocks are found in this parageosyncline? = 这个副地槽中发现了什么类型的岩石？
What is the tectonic setting of this parageosyncline? = 这个副地槽的构造环境是什么？


否定句:
The parageosyncline does not contain significant amounts of volcanic rock. = 副地槽不包含大量的火山岩。
This parageosyncline was not as intensely deformed as the adjacent geosyncline. = 这个副地槽不像邻近的地槽那样变形剧烈。



PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "parageosyncline" as it is a highly specialized geological term.  Phrases would typically involve descriptive terms related to its geological context,  such as:

* parageosyncline sedimentation
* parageosyncline development
* parageosyncline deformation
* parageosyncline stratigraphy
