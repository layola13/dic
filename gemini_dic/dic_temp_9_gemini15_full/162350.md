preacidities:/ˌpriːæˈsɪdətiz/| n. |预酸度，预先酸化|The term "preacidities" refers to the acidity levels measured or predicted before a process, such as fermentation or digestion, begins.  It often involves assessing the initial pH or titratable acidity of a substance.  The measurement is crucial for controlling and optimizing the subsequent process. |Example: The winemaker carefully measured the preacidities of the grapes to ensure proper fermentation.  酿酒师仔细测量了葡萄的预酸度以确保发酵正常进行。  The researchers determined the preacidities of the food samples to study their impact on digestion. 研究人员测定了食物样品的预酸度以研究其对消化的影响。|近义词：initial acidity, prior acidity|反义词：postacidities


USAGE->
There is no standard grammatical usage for "preacidities" as it is a noun and describes a state or measurement.  Therefore, examples of tense usage (past, present, future) are not applicable in the same way as with verbs.  Instead, usage examples focus on how "preacidities" functions within sentences.


Example 1 (Simple Present):  The preacidities of these samples are significantly higher than expected.  这些样品的预酸度比预期的高得多。

Example 2 (Simple Past): The preacidities were carefully recorded before the experiment commenced. 实验开始前，预酸度被仔细记录下来。

Example 3 (Future): We predict that the preacidities will be lower after the addition of the base. 我们预测，加入碱后预酸度会降低。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "preacidities". The word is primarily used in scientific and technical contexts.  Therefore, phrase examples are not applicable.
