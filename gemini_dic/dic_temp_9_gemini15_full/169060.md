词源:

The word "programmable" is derived from the noun "program" and the suffix "-able".

"Program" ultimately comes from the Ancient Greek word "programma" (πρόγραμμα), meaning "a public notice," "proclamation," or "inscription."  This evolved through the Latin "programma" and the Old French "programme" before arriving at its modern English form. In the context of computers, "program" came to refer to a set of instructions.

The suffix "-able" indicates capability or suitability.  Therefore, "programmable" signifies "capable of being programmed."
