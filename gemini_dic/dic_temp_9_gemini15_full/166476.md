词源:
From Old French *prerogative, from Latin prōrogātus, past participle of prōrogāre “to prolong, extend,” from prō- “forward” + rogāre “to ask”.  The original sense referred to something extended or continued, a right that was prolonged or extended beyond the usual.  Over time, the meaning shifted to the specific sense of an exclusive right or privilege.
