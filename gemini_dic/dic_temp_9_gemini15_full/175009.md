radio-opacity: /ˌreɪdiouˈæpəti/ | adj. | 射线不透性，阻射线性 |  The quality of being impervious to X-rays or other forms of radiation.  A radiopaque substance absorbs X-rays, appearing bright or white on an X-ray image.  | Example:  The dentist used a radio-opaque material to fill the cavity.  牙医用射线不透性材料填充龋洞。

The bone's high radio-opacity allowed for clear visualization on the X-ray. 骨骼的高射线不透性使得X光影像清晰可见。|近义词：radiopaque, opaque to radiation |反义词：radiolucent, transparent to radiation
