grommets:/ˈɡrɑːmɪts/ | n. |金属环；防水圈；护圈 | A grommet is a small metal or plastic ring used to reinforce a hole in a material, such as fabric, to prevent tearing or fraying, or to provide a smooth surface for a cable or cord to pass through.  They are often used in sails, awnings, and other applications where fabric is subjected to stress or where cables need protection. |Example:  We used grommets to reinforce the holes in the sailcloth. 我们用金属环加固了帆布上的孔洞。

The canvas needed grommets to prevent tearing at the edges.  帆布需要金属环来防止边缘撕裂。

Etymology:  The word "grommet" comes from the Middle English word "gromit," meaning "a small ring or loop." This, in turn, is likely of Germanic origin, possibly related to words meaning "to bind" or "to fasten."
