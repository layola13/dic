The word "miscaptions" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  However, we can speculate on its possible meaning and structure based on its resemblance to the word "caption."


If it were intended to be a misspelling of "captions," the analysis would be as follows:


captions:/ˈkæpʃənz/| n.|字幕，说明文字|Text or a brief explanation accompanying an image, video, or illustration.|Example: The captions on the YouTube video were helpful.  YouTube视频上的字幕很有帮助。|近义词：subtitles, titles, legends|反义词：N/A
