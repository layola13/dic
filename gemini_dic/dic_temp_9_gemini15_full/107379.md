词源:
The word "lamentedly" is derived from the verb "lament," which comes from the Old French word "lamenter," meaning "to weep, bewail."  The Old French word itself traces back to the Latin word "lamentare," which shares the same meaning.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective "lamented" into an adverb, indicating the manner in which something is done.
