词源:

The word "nonparasitic" is a compound word.  It combines the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "parasitic," which itself comes from the Greek word "parasitos" (παράσιτος), meaning "one who eats at another's table" or "a hanger-on." This reflects the parasitic lifestyle of organisms that live off a host.  The suffix "-ic" turns the noun "parasite" into an adjective.
