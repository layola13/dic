词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the present participle of "comprehend" ("comprehending"), which means "to understand".  "Comprehend" itself comes from the Latin "comprehendere,"  composed of "com-" (together) and "prehendere" (to seize, grasp). Thus, the original sense implies grasping something fully and completely.
