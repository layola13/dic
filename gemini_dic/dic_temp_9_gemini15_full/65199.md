ethylenic:/ˌɛθɪˈliːnɪk/ | adj. | 乙烯的；乙烯基的 | Relating to or containing ethylene (ethene), a simple alkene hydrocarbon.  Ethylenic compounds often exhibit unsaturation and reactivity due to the presence of a carbon-carbon double bond. | Example: The ethylenic double bond in the molecule is highly reactive.  乙烯分子中的双键具有很高的反应活性。 | 近义词: olefinic | 反义词: saturated
