PHRASE->
There are limited common phrases directly using "porner."  The word itself is relatively niche.  Phrases would usually involve the broader concept of pornography, not the specific job title.  Examples might include:

"famous porner" = 知名的色情片制作人/演员
"aspiring porner" = 有抱负的色情片制作人/演员
"controversial porner" = 有争议的色情片制作人/演员
"retired porner" = 退休的色情片制作人/演员
"underground porner" = 地下色情片制作人/演员

Note:  The term "porner" is often considered informal and potentially offensive. More formal and less stigmatizing terms like "adult film actor/actress" or "pornographer" are generally preferred.
