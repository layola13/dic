词源:
The word "disposed" comes from the Old French word "disposer," meaning "to arrange, to set in order."  This in turn derives from the Latin "disponere," formed from "dis-" (apart) and "ponere" (to place).  The sense evolved to include the idea of getting rid of something, as well as having a particular inclination or tendency.
