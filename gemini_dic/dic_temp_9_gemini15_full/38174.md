词源:

The word "comprovincial" is a combination of "com-" (intensive prefix, emphasizing the degree) and "provincial."  "Provincial" derives from the Latin "provincialis," meaning "of or pertaining to a province."  A province, in this historical context, refers to a region or territory under the administration of a larger entity, like a kingdom or empire.  The modern usage of "provincial" and thus "comprovincial" retains this sense of limited perspective, associated with a narrow focus on local matters.
