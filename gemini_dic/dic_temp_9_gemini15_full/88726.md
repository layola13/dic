词源:
The word "hobnob"  is of uncertain origin, possibly a combination of the obsolete word "hob" (meaning a rustic or hobgoblin) and "nob" (meaning head or person of importance).  Its meaning evolved from suggesting a gathering of rustic folk to its current association with friendly socializing, especially among those of some social standing.
