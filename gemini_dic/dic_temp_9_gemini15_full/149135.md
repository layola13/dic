oxidizabilities: /ˌɒksɪdɪˈzæbɪlətiz/ | n. | 氧化性；易氧化性 | The ease with which a substance undergoes oxidation.  It refers to the tendency of a material to lose electrons and form oxides.  The higher the oxidizability, the more readily a substance oxidizes. | Example: The high oxidizability of iron contributes to its corrosion in humid environments.  高铁的氧化性导致其在潮湿环境中腐蚀。 The oxidizabilities of different metals vary significantly. 不同金属的氧化性差异很大。|近义词:  oxidative capacity, susceptibility to oxidation | 反义词:  resistance to oxidation, inoxidizability
