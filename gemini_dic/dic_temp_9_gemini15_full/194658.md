USAGE->
This word is primarily used in scientific and technical contexts, particularly in physics, chemistry, and materials science. Therefore, grammatical examples using various tenses are less relevant than illustrating its usage in different scientific contexts.  It doesn't naturally lend itself to common sentence structures like "What is the self-uniformity of...?"  Instead, it's used attributively or predicatively to describe a characteristic.

Example 1 (Attributive): The self-uniform magnetic field generated by the superconducting coil was crucial for the experiment. 超导线圈产生的自一致磁场对实验至关重要。

Example 2 (Predicative): The crystal structure proved to be self-uniform after analysis. 分析后证明晶体结构是自一致的。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "self-uniform."  Its usage is highly specialized.
