The word "norses" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a very obscure term.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis with pronunciation, word class, translation, etc.  To assist you, I need a correct or more contextually relevant word.
