confounders:/kənˈfaʊndərz/ | n. | 混杂因素，混淆因素 | Variables that influence both the independent and dependent variables, thereby distorting the true relationship between them.  They are often overlooked, leading to inaccurate conclusions.  Confounders can be controlled for through methods like randomization, stratification, or statistical adjustment. | Example: In a study on the effect of smoking on lung cancer, age could be a confounder, as older people are more likely to smoke and also more likely to develop lung cancer.  |近义词：extraneous variables, confounding variables, lurking variables | 反义词：control variables
