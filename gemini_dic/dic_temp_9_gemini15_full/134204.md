词性：名词


词源：

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of".
* **independence**: From "in-" (not) + "dependence" (from Latin *dependentia*, from *dependere* "to hang down, be suspended").  The core meaning thus relates to a lack of self-reliance or freedom from external influence.


USAGE->  (Note:  "Nonindependence" is primarily a statistical term and doesn't have verb conjugations like "hello".)  The usage is primarily descriptive or explanatory within a sentence.  There's no tense conjugation.

Example sentences illustrating its use in different contexts:

* **Descriptive:** The study design suffers from nonindependence due to the clustered sampling method.  = 由于使用了集群抽样方法，研究设计存在非独立性问题。
* **Explanatory:** Nonindependence among the variables necessitates the use of a generalized estimating equation model. = 变量之间的非独立性需要使用广义估计方程模型。
* **Comparative:** Compared to the independent samples, the dependent samples showed significant nonindependence. = 与独立样本相比，相关样本显示出显著的非独立性。
* **Conditional:**  Nonindependence is a concern only if the correlation between observations is substantial. = 只有当观察结果之间的相关性很大时，非独立性才是一个问题。
* **Problem Statement:**  The primary challenge in analyzing this data is addressing the issue of nonindependence. = 分析此数据的首要挑战是解决非独立性问题。


PHRASE->

* **Addressing nonindependence:**  Techniques for addressing nonindependence. = 解决非独立性的方法。
* **Testing for nonindependence:** Tests for nonindependence in time series data. = 时间序列数据中非独立性的检验。
* **Violation of nonindependence assumption:**  A violation of the nonindependence assumption. = 违反非独立性假设。
