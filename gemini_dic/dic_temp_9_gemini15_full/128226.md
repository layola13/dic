neurocytoma:/ˌnʊroʊsaɪˈtoʊmə/| n. |神经细胞瘤|A neurocytoma is a rare type of brain tumor that arises from neurocytes,  cells that are involved in the formation of nerve tissue.  These tumors are typically benign (non-cancerous), although some can be malignant (cancerous).  They are often slow-growing and can occur in various locations within the brain or spinal cord.  Diagnosis usually involves imaging techniques like MRI and CT scans, followed by biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and determine the tumor's grade. Treatment may involve surgical removal, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy, depending on the tumor's location, size, and characteristics. | The patient was diagnosed with a neurocytoma in the cerebrum.  病人被诊断出患有大脑皮质的神经细胞瘤。
