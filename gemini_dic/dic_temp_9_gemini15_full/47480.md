词源:
The word "dealt" is the past tense and past participle of the verb "deal," which ultimately originates from the Old English word "dǣlan," meaning "to divide" or "to distribute."  This Old English word has cognates in other Germanic languages, reflecting its ancient origins.  Over time, the meaning expanded to include the sense of "handling" or "managing" something, as well as the more physical sense of "striking" or "hitting."
