词源：
The word "self-elation" is a compound word.  "Self" is a prefix meaning "of or relating to oneself," and "elation" comes from the Old French word "elacion," meaning "raising up, lifting up," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "elevatio," also meaning "raising up."  Therefore, "self-elation" literally means "a raising up of oneself," reflecting the feeling of heightened self-importance and pride.
