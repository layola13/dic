elastins:/ˈɛlæstɪnz/| n.|弹性蛋白|A group of proteins that are the main components of elastic fibers found in connective tissue.  These proteins provide elasticity and resilience to tissues, allowing them to stretch and recoil. |Example: Elastin fibers are crucial for the elasticity of skin and blood vessels.|近义词：elastic fibers|反义词：collagen (in terms of tissue properties)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The elastin in the skin provides elasticity. = 皮肤中的弹性蛋白提供弹性。
Elastin fibers support the structure of arteries. = 弹性蛋白纤维支撑动脉的结构。


一般过去时:
Scientists studied the properties of elastin. = 科学家研究了弹性蛋白的特性。
The damage to the elastin fibers was evident. = 弹性蛋白纤维的损伤是明显的。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several types of elastin. = 研究人员已经确定了几种类型的弹性蛋白。
The sun exposure has damaged the elastin in her face. = 日晒损伤了她脸上的弹性蛋白。


过去完成时:
Before the injury, the elastin had been perfectly healthy. = 受伤前，弹性蛋白是完全健康的。
They had already studied the effects of elastin degradation. = 他们已经研究了弹性蛋白降解的影响。


将来时:
Scientists will continue to research elastin's properties. = 科学家将继续研究弹性蛋白的特性。
New treatments will target damaged elastin fibers. = 新疗法将针对受损的弹性蛋白纤维。


虚拟语气:
If the elastin were stronger, the tissue would be more resilient. = 如果弹性蛋白更强，组织就会更有弹性。
I wish the elastin in my skin were not damaged. = 我希望我皮肤里的弹性蛋白没有受损。


被动语态:
The elastin is produced by specialized cells. = 弹性蛋白是由特化的细胞产生的。
The integrity of the elastin was compromised by the disease. = 弹性蛋白的完整性因疾病而受损。


疑问句:
What is the role of elastin in the lungs? = 弹性蛋白在肺部起什么作用？
How does elastin contribute to skin aging? = 弹性蛋白如何导致皮肤衰老？


否定句:
The tissue sample did not contain significant amounts of elastin. = 组织样本不含有大量的弹性蛋白。
The skin did not show signs of elastin degradation. = 皮肤没有显示弹性蛋白降解的迹象。


PHRASE->
elastin fibers: 弹性蛋白纤维
elastin degradation: 弹性蛋白降解
elastin synthesis: 弹性蛋白合成
elastin cross-linking: 弹性蛋白交联
elastin structure: 弹性蛋白结构
