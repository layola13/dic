micrometres:/ˈmaɪkrəʊmiːtərz/ | n. |微米 |A micrometre (also spelled micrometer) is a unit of length equal to one millionth of a metre (10⁻⁶ m) or one thousandth of a millimetre. It's commonly used in microscopy, nanotechnology, and other fields dealing with extremely small measurements.  |The diameter of a human hair is approximately 50 to 100 micrometres. |millimetres, nanometres |kilometres |名词
