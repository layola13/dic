词源:

The word "pituitaries" is the plural of "pituitary," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "pituita," meaning "phlegm" or "mucus."  This is because early anatomists associated the gland with the production of nasal mucus.  The "-ary" suffix indicates a connection or relationship to something, forming an adjective that became a noun.
