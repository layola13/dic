The word "nucha" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word.
2. **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word from a different language, possibly transliterated into the English alphabet. If you can provide the language of origin, I might be able to help.
3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, slang term, or a word specific to a certain community or field. More context is needed.

Please provide more information so I can assist you properly.
