词源:
The word "mortified" comes from the Latin word "mortificare," which means "to subdue, to deaden, to kill."  In its original religious context, it referred to the denial of physical needs or desires, a process of spiritual self-discipline. Over time, the meaning evolved to describe the feeling of being humbled or deeply embarrassed, as if one's pride or self-esteem has been "killed" or subdued.
