The mucigenous cells in the respiratory tract help to trap and remove foreign particles.| 例句：The goblet cells are mucigenous, secreting mucus to lubricate the intestinal lining.  (杯状细胞是产生黏液的，分泌黏液以润滑肠道内壁。) The mucigenic glands in the nose help to keep the nasal passages moist. (鼻子里的黏液腺有助于保持鼻腔湿润。) |近义词：mucous, mucoid |反义词：dry


USAGE->
一般现在时:
