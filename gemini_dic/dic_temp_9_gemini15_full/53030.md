diode:/ˈdaɪoʊd/ | n. |二极管 |A diode is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts current primarily in one direction; it acts as a one-way valve for electricity, allowing current to flow easily in one direction but blocking it in the opposite direction.  This unidirectional conductivity is based on the diode's semiconductor material and its p-n junction. Diodes are used in a wide variety of electronic circuits for rectification, signal clipping, voltage regulation, and many other functions. | Example:  The rectifier circuit uses diodes to convert alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC).  二极管整流电路用于将交流电 (AC) 转换为直流电 (DC). |近义词：rectifier (in some contexts) |反义词：None (no direct antonym, but its function is reversed by using multiple diodes in a different configuration)
