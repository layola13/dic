词源:
From Italian *concertante*, present participle of *concertare* "to agree, concert," from Latin *concertare* "to strive together, contend," from *con-* "together" + *certare* "to strive, contend."  The musical meaning developed from the idea of a musical contest or interplay between different instrumental groups or a soloist and an ensemble.
