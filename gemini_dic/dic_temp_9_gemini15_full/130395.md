词源:
The word "non-violence" is a compound word.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "violence" comes from the Old French "violence," ultimately derived from the Latin "violentia," meaning "force," "injury," or "outrage." Therefore, non-violence literally means "not violence," or the absence of violent acts.
