词源:
The word "parvenu" comes from the French verb "parvenir," meaning "to arrive," "to succeed," or "to attain."  It originally described someone who had recently achieved success or status, often implying a lack of refinement or social grace associated with those of established wealth and lineage.  It entered English in the 18th century.
