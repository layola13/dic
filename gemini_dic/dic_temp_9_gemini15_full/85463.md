The word "hask" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical explanations as requested.  To help you, I need a correctly spelled word.
