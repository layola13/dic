The word "paytine" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or phrases associated with it.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specific jargon or dialect not widely known.
