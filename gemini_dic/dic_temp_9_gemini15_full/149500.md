paederasty: /pɪˈdɛrəsti/ | n. | 男童色情；男色恋 |  The sexual abuse of boys by adult men.  The term often carries strong negative connotations, implying exploitation and harm.

The term has also been used in modern times, though usually with strong condemnation, to describe the sexual abuse of boys by adult men.  Modern usage emphasizes the abusive and exploitative nature of such relationships.  |近义词:  child sexual abuse, male sexual abuse of a minor, pederophilia (though pederasty specifically refers to the act, while pederophilia refers to the paraphilia). |反义词:  N/A (The word itself denotes a negative action, so there's no direct antonym).  |
