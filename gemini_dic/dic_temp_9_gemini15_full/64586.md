erucic: /ɪˈruːsɪk/ | n. |芥酸|A fatty acid found in some plant oils, especially rapeseed oil.  It is a long-chain monounsaturated fatty acid with 22 carbon atoms and one double bond.  High levels of erucic acid in the diet have been linked to heart problems in some studies, though this is debated.  |例句：Rapeseed oil contains a significant amount of erucic acid.  = 芥花油含有大量的芥酸。


The high erucic acid content of some rapeseed oils was a concern in the past. = 过去，某些芥花油的高芥酸含量曾是一个问题。|近义词：docosenoic acid|反义词：无

词源:
The word "erucic" is derived from the genus name *Eruca*, referring to the genus of plants (rocket, arugula) from which oils containing the acid were originally extracted.  The suffix "-ic" indicates an adjective or relating to.
