词源:

The word "inconvincible" is formed by adding the negative prefix "in-" to the adjective "convincible," meaning "capable of being convinced."  "Convincible" itself derives from the verb "convince," which comes from the Old French word "convincre," ultimately from the Latin "convincere," meaning "to overcome," "to conquer," or "to prove guilty." The prefix "con-" means "together" or "thoroughly," and "vincere" means "to conquer" or "to overcome." Thus, "convincere" literally means to overcome completely, leading to the sense of persuading someone.
