The word originates from the verb "disguise," which comes from the Old French word "deguiser," meaning "to disguise."  This further derives from "des-" (intensive prefix) + "guise" (appearance, manner). The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "disguised" into a noun, indicating a state or quality.  The "-es" suffix creates the plural form.
