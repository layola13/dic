词源:  The word "pooh-pooh" itself is onomatopoeic, imitating the sound of expressing disdain or dismissal.  It's a reduplication (repeating a word or syllable) that emphasizes the dismissive nature of the action.  The "-ers" suffix transforms the verb form into a noun indicating a person who performs the action. Therefore, "pooh-poohers" are those who perform the act of pooh-poohing.
