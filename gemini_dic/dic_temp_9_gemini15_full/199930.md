词源:

The word "siziness" is derived from the word "size," which ultimately traces back to the Old French word "sise," meaning "portion," "size," or "measure."  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix that converts adjectives into nouns, signifying a quality or state.  Therefore, "siziness" denotes the quality or state of possessing size or magnitude.
