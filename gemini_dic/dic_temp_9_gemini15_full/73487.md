The word "forers" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  Perhaps a word related to "fore" (as in "before") or "foreigners"?  Please double-check the spelling.
* **A neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.  If this is the case, please provide more context where you encountered this word.
* **A proper noun:**  Possibly a name or place name.


Without further information, I cannot provide a detailed analysis according to the requested format.  Please clarify the word or provide more context.
