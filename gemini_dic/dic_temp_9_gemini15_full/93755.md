反义词：measurability, quantifiability


词源:  The word is derived from the prefix "im-" (meaning "not"), "measure" (meaning "to determine the size, amount, or degree of something"), and the suffix "-ability" (meaning "the quality or state of being").  Therefore, "immeasurability" literally means "the state of not being able to be measured."
