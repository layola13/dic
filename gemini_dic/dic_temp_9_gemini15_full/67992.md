词源:

The word "factionalists" is derived from the noun "faction," which comes from the Latin word "factio," meaning "a doing, making, a party, a faction."  The suffix "-alist" is added to indicate a person who belongs to or supports a particular faction.  Therefore, "factionalists" literally means "those who belong to or support a faction."
