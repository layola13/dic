penetrance: /ˈpɛnɪtrəns/ | n. |外显率；表现度| The proportion of individuals carrying a particular variant of a gene (allele or genotype) that also express the associated phenotype.  It represents the probability that a person carrying a particular genotype will express the corresponding phenotype.  Penetrance can be complete (100%), meaning that everyone with the genotype shows the phenotype, or incomplete, ranging from near 0% to 100%. Incomplete penetrance occurs when individuals with a genotype for a particular trait do not express the expected phenotype.| 例句：The penetrance of Huntington's disease is high, meaning most individuals with the gene will develop the disorder. 亨廷顿舞蹈症的外显率很高，这意味着大多数携带该基因的个体都会患上这种疾病。


The penetrance of BRCA1 mutations in breast cancer varies. BRCA1基因突变在乳腺癌中的外显率是不同的。| 近义词：expressivity | 反义词：non-penetrance


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The penetrance of this gene is high. = 这个基因的外显率很高。
What is the penetrance of this specific mutation? = 这个特定突变的外显率是多少？

一般过去时:
The penetrance of the disease was found to be incomplete. = 发现该疾病的外显率是不完全的。
Scientists studied the penetrance of the gene in different populations. = 科学家研究了该基因在不同人群中的外显率。

现在完成时:
Researchers have determined the penetrance of several genetic disorders. = 研究人员已经确定了几种遗传疾病的外显率。
Studies have shown that the penetrance can vary widely. = 研究表明，外显率差异很大。

过去完成时:
Before the study, the penetrance of the gene had been unknown. = 在这项研究之前，该基因的外显率是未知的。
They had already suspected that the penetrance would be low. = 他们已经怀疑外显率会很低。

将来时:
Future studies will investigate the penetrance of this new mutation. = 未来的研究将调查这种新的突变的外显率。
We will analyze the data to determine the penetrance. = 我们将分析数据以确定外显率。

虚拟语气:
If the penetrance were complete, we would see the phenotype in every carrier. = 如果外显率是完全的，我们将在每个携带者身上看到该表型。
It is important to note that the penetrance could be different in different environmental settings. = 需要注意的是，外显率在不同的环境设置中可能不同。

被动语态:

The penetrance was incorrectly calculated in previous studies. = 在之前的研究中，外显率计算错误。

疑问句:
What is the age-dependent penetrance of this condition? = 这种情况的年龄依赖性外显率是多少？
How does environmental factors affect the penetrance? = 环境因素如何影响外显率？

否定句:
The penetrance of this allele is not complete. = 这个等位基因的外显率不是完全的。
The study did not find evidence for incomplete penetrance. = 该研究未发现不完全外显率的证据。


PHRASE->
age-dependent penetrance  年龄依赖性外显率
reduced penetrance  降低的外显率
incomplete penetrance 不完全外显率
high penetrance 高外显率
variable penetrance 可变外显率

词源:
penetrance comes from the verb "penetrate," meaning to pierce or pass into.  In genetics, it refers to the ability of a gene to "penetrate" or manifest its effect in the phenotype.  The "-ance" suffix indicates a state or quality.
