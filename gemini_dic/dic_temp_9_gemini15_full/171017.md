词源：pseudo- (from Greek *pseudos*, meaning "false") + servile (from Latin *servilis*, meaning "of or belonging to a slave").  The word combines the prefix "pseudo" indicating falseness with the adjective "servile," signifying slavish obedience.  Therefore, "pseudoservilely" describes an action performed with a false display of subservience.
