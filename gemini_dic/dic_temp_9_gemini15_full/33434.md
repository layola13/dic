词源:
The word "churl" has Old English roots, deriving from the word *ceorl*, meaning a freeman of low rank.  In Old English society, *ceorls* were contrasted with the nobility, and often associated with rusticity and lack of refinement. Over time, the word's meaning shifted to emphasize negative qualities like rudeness and stinginess, losing its original social class connotations.
