The term "fish finger" is a descriptive compound word.  "Fish" refers to the main ingredient, and "finger" describes the shape and size of the processed fish product.  The term emerged in the mid-20th century with the rise of processed convenience foods.  There's no specific etymological history beyond this straightforward combination of descriptive terms.
