词源:
The word "sabotage" originates from the French word "sabot," meaning "wooden shoe."  In the 18th and 19th centuries, French workers sometimes threw their sabots (wooden shoes) into machinery to disrupt production during strikes or protests. This act became associated with deliberate destruction or disruption, leading to the evolution of the word "sabotage" in its modern sense.
