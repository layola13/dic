词源:
Creepiness comes from the word "creepy," which is derived from "creep," meaning to move slowly and silently, often in a stealthy or furtive manner.  The addition of "-iness" forms a noun, signifying the quality or state of being creepy.  The sense of unease and fear associated with slow, silent movement contributed to the current meaning of "creepiness."
