词源：The word "libertine" comes from the Old French word "libertin," meaning "free," which in turn derives from the Latin word "libertinus," meaning "freedman" or "one who is free."  The original sense referred to someone who was freed from slavery, but the meaning evolved to encompass freedom from moral restraint.
