词源:  The word "hauteur" comes from the Old French word "hauteur," meaning "height," "tallness," or "elevation."  This original sense evolved to encompass the metaphorical "height" of social standing and the accompanying sense of superiority.  The shift in meaning reflects how elevated social position was often associated with arrogance and disdain.
