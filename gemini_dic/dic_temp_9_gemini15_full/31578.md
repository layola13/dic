chasmiest: /ˈtʃæzmiɪst/ | adj. | 最深渊的，最巨大的 |  This word is not found in standard English dictionaries. It appears to be a superlative form of a non-standard or rarely used word, possibly "chasmic," which itself is not extremely common.  It's likely formed by adding the superlative suffix "-est" to a base related to "chasm."  The meaning would be an intensification of the characteristic of a chasm – extreme depth or vastness.   Since it's not a standard word, providing examples, synonyms, or antonyms is difficult.  Its usage would depend entirely on the context in which an author might choose to use it for creative effect or to emphasize a particularly profound depth or size.
