The word "psychogeographical" is a blend of "psycho-" (from Greek *psykhē*, meaning "soul" or "mind") and "geographical" (from Greek *gē* meaning "earth" and *graphein* meaning "to write").  The combination suggests a study of the interaction between the mind and the geographical environment.  The term was popularized by the Situationist International in the mid-20th century.
