The word "marysole" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a proper noun, a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a name.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide an analysis, I need more context about where you encountered this word.  Is it a brand name, a person's name, or something else?


If you can provide context, I can offer a more informed response.
