The word "catel" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it with any standard pronunciation, part of speech, meaning, etymology, etc.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis as requested.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* It's a technical term from a very specific field (e.g., a niche scientific area or a specialized jargon).  If you can provide context, that might help.
* It's a newly coined word or a proper noun (name of a person, place, or thing) not yet widely recognized.

Please clarify the source of this word or provide more context so I can assist you further.
