The word "pait" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* It's a word from a dialect or a very specialized field.
* It's a newly coined word or a proper noun.

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you can.  With more information, I can try to help.
