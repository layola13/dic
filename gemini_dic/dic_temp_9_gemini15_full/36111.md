词源:
From the verb "coerce" + "-ible" (suffix indicating capability). "Coerce" ultimately derives from the Latin word "coergere," meaning "to drive together, restrain."  The prefix "co-" means "together," and "ergere" means "to raise, lift, or direct."  The sense evolved to imply forcing someone to act against their will.
