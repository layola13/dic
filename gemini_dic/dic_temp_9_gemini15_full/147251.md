词源:

The word "overmercifulness" is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively"), the adjective "merciful" (meaning compassionate and forgiving), and the suffix "-ness" (indicating a state or quality).  Therefore, it literally means the state of being excessively merciful.  The root of "merciful" traces back to Old French *merciable, ultimately deriving from the Latin *misericordia (pity, mercy).
