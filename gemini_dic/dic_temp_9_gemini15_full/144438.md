PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "outswear".  The verb is quite specific in its meaning.


词源:
The word "outswear" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "to surpass" or "to exceed") and the verb "swear."  The verb "swear" itself has a long history, deriving from Old English *swerian, ultimately related to words meaning "to affirm" or "to promise."  The sense of using profane language developed later.
