The word "estatlich" is not an English word.  It appears to be a misspelling or a word from another language, possibly German.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information in English as requested.  If you can provide the correct spelling or the language of origin, I can offer a more accurate analysis.
