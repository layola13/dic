词源:
The word "seraphical" is derived from the noun "seraph," ultimately from the Hebrew word שׂרָף (saraph), meaning "burning one" or "fiery serpent."  In biblical contexts, seraphim are celestial beings of immense power and beauty, often depicted as having six wings.  The "-ical" suffix transforms the noun into an adjective, signifying "of the nature of" or "relating to."
