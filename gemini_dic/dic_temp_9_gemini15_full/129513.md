non-associative: /ˌnɒnəˈsoʊʃieɪtɪv/ | adj. | 非结合性的，非结合的 |  Describes a binary operation where the order of operations matters;  (a*b)*c ≠ a*(b*c).  This means that the result of the operation changes depending on how the terms are grouped.  This contrasts with associative operations, where the grouping does not affect the result. | Example: Subtraction is non-associative. (10 - 5) - 2 = 3, but 10 - (5 - 2) = 7. | 近义词: non-commutative (in some contexts) | 反义词: associative |


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The operation is non-associative. = 这个运算是非结合性的。
This system demonstrates non-associative behavior. = 这个系统表现出非结合性的行为。


一般过去时:
The calculation was non-associative. = 这个计算是非结合性的。
The students learned about non-associative operations. = 学生们学习了非结合性运算。


现在完成时:
We have proven that the structure is non-associative. = 我们已经证明该结构是非结合性的。
They have explored several non-associative algebras. = 他们已经探索了几种非结合代数。


过去完成时:
The mathematicians had already discovered the non-associative property. = 数学家们早已发现了非结合性性质。
Before the presentation, I had reviewed non-associative concepts. = 在演示之前，我已经复习了非结合性概念。


将来时:
We will analyze the non-associative aspects of this problem. = 我们将分析这个问题的非结合性方面。
The researchers will investigate non-associative structures. = 研究人员将研究非结合性结构。


虚拟语气:
If the operation were associative, it would simplify the calculations. = 如果该运算是结合性的，它将简化计算。
I wish the system were associative, it would be easier to manage. = 我希望该系统是结合性的，这样管理起来会更容易。


被动语态:
The non-associative property is often overlooked. = 非结合性属性经常被忽视。

否定句:
The operation is not non-associative; it's associative. = 该运算不是非结合性的；它是结合性的。
The result does not demonstrate non-associative behavior. = 结果没有表现出非结合性的行为。


PHRASE->
non-associative algebra = 非结合代数
non-associative loop = 非结合环
