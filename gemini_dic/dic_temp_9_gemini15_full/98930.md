词源:  Derived from the adjective "intent," meaning "having the mind fixed on something; determined."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun signifying the state or quality of being intent.  The word ultimately traces back to the Latin word "intendere," meaning "to stretch out," "to aim," or "to direct one's mind."
