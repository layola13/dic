recessives:/rɪˈsɛsɪvz/| adj.|隐性的；隐性基因的|Relating to or denoting heritable characteristics controlled by genes that are expressed only when present in duplicate.  Recessive genes are masked by dominant genes.  |Example:  Blue eyes are a recessive trait.|近义词：latent, dormant|反义词：dominant


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The recessive gene is masked by the dominant gene. = 隐性基因被显性基因掩盖了。
Recessive traits often skip a generation. = 隐性性状往往会跳过一代。


一般过去时:
The scientists studied recessive genes in plants. = 科学家们研究了植物中的隐性基因。
The experiment showed the recessive trait did not appear. = 实验表明隐性性状没有出现。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified many recessive genes. = 研究人员已经鉴定了许多隐性基因。
We have learned a lot about recessive inheritance. = 我们已经了解了很多关于隐性遗传的知识。


过去完成时:
They had already known about the recessive gene before the experiment. = 他们在实验之前就已经知道这个隐性基因了。
Scientists had discovered many recessive diseases by then. = 到那时，科学家们已经发现了许多隐性遗传疾病。


将来时:
Future research will focus on recessive genetic disorders. = 未来的研究将集中在隐性遗传疾病上。
They will investigate the impact of recessive alleles. = 他们将调查隐性等位基因的影响。


虚拟语气:
If the gene were recessive, it wouldn't show. = 如果基因是隐性的，它就不会表现出来。
I wish I had known about the recessive allele earlier. = 我希望我早点知道这个隐性等位基因。


被动语态:
Recessive traits are often overlooked. = 隐性性状往往被忽视。
The recessive gene was identified in the study. = 在这项研究中发现了隐性基因。


疑问句:
Is this trait recessive or dominant? = 这种性状是隐性的还是显性的？
Are there any known recessive genes related to this disease? = 有任何已知的与这种疾病相关的隐性基因吗？


否定句:
This gene is not recessive; it's dominant. = 这个基因不是隐性的；它是显性的。
The phenotype did not show the recessive trait. = 表型没有显示隐性性状。


PHRASE->
recessive allele = 隐性等位基因
recessive gene = 隐性基因
recessive inheritance = 隐性遗传
recessive trait = 隐性性状
recessive disorder = 隐性遗传病
