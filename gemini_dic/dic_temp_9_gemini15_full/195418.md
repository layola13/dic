词源:
The word "seminar" comes from the Latin word "seminarium," which means "seed plot" or "nursery."  It later evolved through the French word "séminaire," which originally referred to a religious college or seminary. The modern meaning evolved from the idea of a place where ideas are cultivated and developed, like seeds in a nursery.
