regularizations:/ˌreɡjʊləraɪˈzeɪʃənz/ | n. | 正规化；规则化；规范化 | The process of making something conform to rules or standards, often in a specific field like mathematics, statistics, or law.  It aims to reduce complexity, improve stability, or prevent overfitting in models or systems.  | 例句：The regularizations implemented in the algorithm significantly improved its accuracy.  算法中实施的正规化显著提高了其准确性。


例句：Regularizations are crucial for preventing overfitting in machine learning models. 机器学习模型中，正规化对于防止过度拟合至关重要。


近义词：standardization, normalization, formalization | 反义词：randomization, deregulation


词源：源自regularize (v.) + -ation (n. suffix),  regularize本身源自regular (adj.) + -ize (v. suffix).  Regular comes from Latin *regulāris, from regula ("rule").
