词源:  The word "limper" is derived from the verb "to limp," meaning to walk lamely or with difficulty.  The suffix "-er" indicates an agent or doer of the action.  The ultimate origin is uncertain, but possibly related to Old English words suggesting weakness or feebleness.  The word's usage has remained relatively consistent throughout its history, referring to those who have difficulty walking due to injury or other conditions.
