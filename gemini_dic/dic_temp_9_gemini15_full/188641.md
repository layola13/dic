词源:
The word "rummage" ultimately derives from the Middle Dutch word "rommen," meaning "to stir up," or "to rumple."  This reflects the action of actively searching through a jumbled collection of items.  The word entered English in the 16th century and its meaning has evolved to encompass the thorough, sometimes chaotic nature of the search.
