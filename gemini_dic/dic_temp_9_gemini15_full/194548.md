self-similarity: /ˌsɛlfˈsɪmələriti/ | n. | 自相似性 | The property of an object or a system that exhibits similar patterns at different scales of observation.  This means that parts of the object are similar in shape to the whole object.  This concept is often found in fractals and other complex systems.  | Example:  The branching pattern of a tree shows self-similarity, as smaller branches resemble the larger branches and the overall shape of the tree.  The coastline of a country also exhibits self-similarity, in that its shape repeats at different scales. | 近义词: scale invariance, recursion | 反义词: homogeneity, uniformity |  名词
