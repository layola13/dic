sinistrin:/ˈsɪnɪstrɪn/| n. |左旋多聚糖，左旋糖|A type of polysaccharide, a type of complex carbohydrate, found in some plants, especially in the leaves of certain cacti, that is levorotatory (rotates polarized light to the left).  It is also known as a type of fructan.| Example:  The researchers analyzed the sinistrin content in different cactus species. 研究人员分析了不同仙人掌物种中的左旋多聚糖含量。|近义词：fructan (a broader term)|反义词：dextran (a right-rotating polysaccharide)
