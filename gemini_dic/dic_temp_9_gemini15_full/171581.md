词源:
The word "Pullman" is derived from the name of George Mortimer Pullman (1831-1897), an American engineer and industrialist who designed and built the first Pullman sleeping car in the 1860s.  His company, the Pullman Palace Car Company, became highly successful and the name became synonymous with luxury rail travel.
