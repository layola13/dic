词源：

The word "denominational" is derived from the noun "denomination," which itself comes from the verb "denominate," meaning "to give a name to" or "to designate."  The suffix "-ational" transforms the noun into an adjective, indicating something related to or characteristic of a denomination.  The root of "denominate" lies in the Latin word "denominare," composed of "de-" (down, from) and "nominare" (to name). Therefore, "denominational" ultimately signifies something relating to the naming or classifying of religious groups.
