non-orientability: /ˌnɒnˌɔːriənˈtæbɪləti/ | n. |不可定向性|The property of a geometric object that it cannot consistently assign an "inside" and "outside" to its surfaces.  In simpler terms, it means you can't consistently define a "direction" or "orientation" on the surface.  For example, if you travel continuously around a surface and end up back at your starting point, but your orientation (e.g., the direction you are facing) is reversed, the surface is non-orientable.  This is in contrast to orientable surfaces like a sphere, where you can consistently define an "inside" and "outside".|A Möbius strip is a classic example of a non-orientable surface.  If you draw a line down the middle of a Möbius strip and continue, you'll end up back where you started, but on the opposite side of the line. This demonstrates its non-orientability.


The Klein bottle is another example of a non-orientable surface.  It's a three-dimensional object, but cannot be embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space without self-intersections.  Imagine trying to color one side of a Klein bottle; you would inevitably end up coloring the other “side” as well.
