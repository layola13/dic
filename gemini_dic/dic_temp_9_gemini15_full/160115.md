词源:
The word "pommel" in this context ultimately derives from the Old French word "pommeler," meaning "to beat" or "to pound."  This, in turn, is related to the Latin word "pomum," meaning "apple," which is believed to have been used metaphorically, referring to something round and potentially used as a weapon or instrument for pounding.  The evolution of the word likely involved a shift from a more literal meaning to a more figurative and violent one.
