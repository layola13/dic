post-larval: /ˌpoʊstˈlɑːrvəl/ | adj. | 后幼虫期的 |  Describing the stage of an organism's life cycle after the larval stage but before the adult stage. This period is characterized by significant growth and development, often involving metamorphosis.  | Example: Post-larval development in this species is characterized by rapid growth and the acquisition of adult features.  后幼虫期的这个物种以快速生长和获得成虫特征为特征。|近义词：postlarval, juvenile |反义词：larval
