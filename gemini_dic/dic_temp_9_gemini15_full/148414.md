The word "oversteadfastly" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word or a nonce word (created for a specific purpose).  It seems to be formed by combining "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great extent) and "steadfastly" (meaning firmly and resolutely).


Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  However, we can analyze its potential meaning and construction:

/ˌoʊvərˈstɛdfæstli/ | adj. | 过于坚定地，极其坚定地 | Excessively or stubbornly steadfast;  implying an inflexibility that may be detrimental.  The word suggests an unwavering commitment to a point of being unreasonable or excessive. |  He oversteadfastly refused to consider any alternative solutions, leading to a project failure. 他过于坚定地拒绝考虑任何替代方案，导致项目失败。| steadfastly, resolutely, stubbornly |  wavering, irresolute, flexible | adj.
