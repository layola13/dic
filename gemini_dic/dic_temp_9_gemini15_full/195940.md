词源:
The word "sensitizing" comes from the verb "sensitize," which itself derives from the adjective "sensitive."  "Sensitive" ultimately comes from the Latin word "sentire," meaning "to feel" or "to perceive."  The "-ize" suffix is a verb-forming suffix indicating "to make" or "to cause to become."  Therefore, "sensitizing" means "making sensitive" or "causing to become sensitive."
