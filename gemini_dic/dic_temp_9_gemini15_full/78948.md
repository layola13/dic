词源:

The word "girdler" is derived from the verb "gird," which comes from the Old English word "gyrdan," meaning "to bind," "to surround," or "to enclose."  The "-ler" suffix transforms the verb into a noun denoting an agent or instrument.  Therefore, a "girdler" is something that performs the action of girding.
