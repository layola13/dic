The word "prighte" does not exist in modern English.  There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  If you can provide the context where you encountered this word, it might help determine the intended word.

2. **It's an archaic or dialectal word:** It could be an obsolete word from Middle English or a word used in a specific regional dialect.  Further research into historical dictionaries might be necessary.

3. **It's a neologism or made-up word:**  It's possible the word is newly coined or invented.

Without further information, I cannot provide a full analysis as requested in the format.  Please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
