metatungstate:/ˌmɛtəˈtʌŋsteɪt/| n. |偏钨酸盐|A salt or ester of metatungstic acid. Metatungstates are polyoxometalates containing the [W12O39]6− anion, a cluster of twelve tungsten atoms bound together by oxygen atoms.  They are used in various applications due to their unique properties, such as high density, strong acidity, and catalytic activity. |例句：The researchers synthesized a new metatungstate compound with improved catalytic properties. 研究人员合成了一种具有改进催化性能的新型偏钨酸盐化合物。

The solution contained a high concentration of sodium metatungstate.  该溶液含有高浓度的偏钨酸钠。


近义词：polyoxotungstate (a broader term)|反义词：N/A


词源:  The word "metatungstate" is a combination of "meta-" (indicating a specific isomer or form, often implying a higher degree of condensation), "tungstate" (referring to a salt of tungstic acid), and the suffix "-ate" denoting a salt.  "Tungstate" itself derives from the element tungsten, originally named "tung sten" (heavy stone) in Swedish.
