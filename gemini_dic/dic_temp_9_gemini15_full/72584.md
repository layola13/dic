fluxionist: /ˈflʌkʃənɪst/ | n. | 流动论者；微积分学者 | A fluxionist is a proponent of the method of fluxions, a precursor to modern calculus developed by Isaac Newton.  They believe in and utilize the principles of this early form of calculus. |  Isaac Newton was a prominent fluxionist, and his work significantly impacted the development of mathematics. | 近义词：mathematician, calculus expert | 反义词： (no direct antonym, but someone opposed to the method of fluxions could be considered an antonym)


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in historical contexts relating to the development of calculus.  Therefore, demonstrating tense usage is less relevant than explaining its historical application.

Example 1 (Simple Past):
Many fluxionists of the 18th century debated the merits of Newton's method. = 18世纪许多微积分学者都争论牛顿方法的优缺点。


Example 2 (Simple Past):
The early fluxionists lacked the rigorous notation and framework of modern calculus. = 早期的微积分学者缺乏现代微积分的严格符号和框架。


PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases directly using "fluxionist."  The word itself is highly specialized and rarely used outside academic discussions of the history of mathematics.  Instead, phrases would revolve around the concept of fluxions or the historical period:

Phrase 1:  Newtonian fluxions = 牛顿的微积分法
Phrase 2:  Method of fluxions = 微积分法
Phrase 3:  Infinitesimal calculus (a related concept) = 无穷小微积分
Phrase 4:  17th-century mathematics = 17世纪的数学
Phrase 5:  The development of calculus = 微积分的发展
