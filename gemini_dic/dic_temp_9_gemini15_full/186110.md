rhabdomere:/ˈræbdəˌmɪər/| n. |肌原纤维；视杆体；感光细胞|A rod-shaped contractile element of a muscle fiber, especially in an insect's flight muscle.  It's also a light-sensitive element within a photoreceptor cell, such as a rhabdom in an invertebrate eye.|The rhabdomeres in the fly's eye are highly sensitive to light.|近义词：photoreceptor element (in the context of light sensitivity)|反义词：无
