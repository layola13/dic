kerneling: /ˈkɜːrnəlɪŋ/ | n. | 内核化；内核编程 | The process of developing or using a kernel, especially in the context of operating systems.  It refers to the low-level programming involved in creating or interacting with the core part of an operating system. | Example:  The developers spent months on kernelling the new operating system.  开发人员花了数月时间进行新的操作系统内核编程。|近义词：core programming, system programming |反义词：application programming


USAGE->
一般现在时:
He is kernelling the new driver. = 他正在为新驱动编写内核代码。
They kernel the system regularly. = 他们定期对系统进行内核更新。


一般过去时:
She kernelled the operating system last year. = 她去年对操作系统进行了内核编程。
We kernelled the device driver successfully. = 我们成功地为设备驱动程序编写了内核代码。


现在完成时:
They have kernelled several different operating systems. = 他们已经为几种不同的操作系统编写了内核代码。
The team has kernelled a new security feature. = 该团队已经为系统添加了一个新的内核安全特性。


过去完成时:
They had kernelled the driver before the deadline. = 他们在截止日期前已经完成了驱动程序的内核编程。
We had kernelled the entire system by then. = 到那时我们已经完成了整个系统的内核编程。


将来时:
They will kernel the next version of the OS. = 他们将为下一版本的OS编写内核代码。
She will kernel the new hardware driver. = 她将为新的硬件驱动编写内核代码。


虚拟语气:
If I were an expert, I would kernel the system myself. = 如果我是专家，我会自己编写系统内核。
I wish I had kernelled the system earlier. = 我希望我早点完成系统内核编程。


被动语态:
The system was kernelled by a team of experts. = 该系统由专家团队进行内核编程。
The driver is being kernelled currently. = 驱动程序目前正在进行内核编程。


疑问句:
Are they kernelling the new software? = 他们正在为新软件编写内核代码吗？
Has the kernel been kernelled successfully? = 内核是否已成功编程？


否定句:
They did not kernel the system properly. = 他们没有正确地编写系统内核。
He hasn't kernelled the driver yet. = 他还没有完成驱动程序的内核编程。
