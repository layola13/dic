cephalization:/ˌsefələˈzeɪʃən/| n. |头端化，头部集中|The concentration of sensory organs and nervous tissue at the anterior end of an organism. This process is associated with bilateral symmetry and active locomotion.  Cephalization allows for more efficient processing of sensory information and coordinated responses to environmental stimuli.|例句：Cephalization is a key evolutionary adaptation that enabled animals to become more efficient predators and to navigate their environments more effectively. 头端化是一个关键的进化适应，使动物能够成为更有效的捕食者，并更有效地导航其环境。|近义词：encephaliation|反义词：无
