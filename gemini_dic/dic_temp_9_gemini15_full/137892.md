The word "nonvitality" is a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "vitality" (meaning "the state of being alive and strong").  "Vitality"  itself comes from the Latin word "vitalitas," derived from "vita" (life).  Therefore, nonvitality literally means "not having the quality of life or energy".
