词源:
The word "overorganize" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "organize."  The verb "organize" itself has roots in the French word "organiser," ultimately derived from the Greek word "organon" (meaning "tool" or "instrument").  Therefore, "overorganize" literally means to use "tools" or methods of organization to an excessive degree.
