词源:
The word "locusting" derives directly from the noun "locust," referring to a type of short-horned grasshopper that often swarms in massive numbers, causing widespread destruction to crops and vegetation.  The "-ing" suffix transforms the noun into a verb, indicating the action of locusts swarming and causing damage.  The figurative usage extends this to describe any overwhelming influx or spread.
