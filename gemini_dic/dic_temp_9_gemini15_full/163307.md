preconfessions:/ˌpriːkənˈfɛʃənz/| n.|忏悔前的陈述，供词前的交代|Statements made before a formal confession, often providing context or partial admissions of guilt.

They might be used to inform the investigation or guide the line of questioning during a formal confession.|例句：The police obtained several preconfessions from the suspect before he formally confessed to the crime. = 在嫌疑犯正式认罪之前，警方从他那里获得了几份供词前的交代。

The suspect's preconfessions were contradictory and unreliable. = 嫌疑犯供词前的交代前后矛盾且不可靠。|近义词：preliminary statements, anticipatory admissions|反义词：confession (in the sense of a fully legally binding statement)|名词
