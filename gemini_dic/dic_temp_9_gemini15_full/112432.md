词源:

The word "lottery" comes from the Middle Dutch word "lotterie," which itself is derived from the Old French word "lot," meaning "fate" or "destiny."  The evolution reflects the inherent element of chance associated with lotteries.  The word's usage has broadened over time to include any system or process that involves a random selection of winners or outcomes.
