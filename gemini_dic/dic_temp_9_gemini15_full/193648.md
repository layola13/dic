self-catalyst: /ˈsɛlf ˈkætəlɪst/ | n. | 自催化剂 | A substance that acts as a catalyst for its own formation.  In other words, it is a product of a reaction that also accelerates that same reaction. | Example:  The initial formation of RNA molecules could have been a self-catalytic process, with RNA molecules catalyzing their own replication.  最初RNA分子的形成可能是一个自催化过程，RNA分子催化自身复制。| 近义词：autocatalyst | 反义词：inhibitor (抑制剂)
