hypercomposite:/ˌhaɪpərˈkɒmpəzɪt/| adj. |超复合的，高度复合的 |Highly composite; having a significantly larger number of divisors than any smaller positive integer.  A number is hypercomposite if it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.  This is a relatively specialized mathematical term. | Example:  The number 12 is a highly composite number, but it's not necessarily a *hypercomposite* number in the strictest sense, as the definition often requires a more rigorous comparison of divisor counts.  The precise definition can vary depending on the context. |近义词：highly composite, abundant |反义词：prime, sparsely composite


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in mathematical contexts and doesn't lend itself to common grammatical structures like the examples provided for "what."  Therefore, I will provide example sentences demonstrating its usage in mathematical discussions.

Example Sentence 1:
"The number 60 is a highly composite number; it's a candidate for being a hypercomposite number, but further analysis is required to confirm it." = 数字 60 是一个高度复合数；它是超复合数的候选数，但需要进一步分析才能确认。

Example Sentence 2:
"Researchers are investigating the properties of hypercomposite numbers in relation to prime factorization." = 研究人员正在研究超复合数与质因数分解的关系。


PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases directly incorporating "hypercomposite."  The term is used within mathematical discussions and theorems, not in everyday language.
