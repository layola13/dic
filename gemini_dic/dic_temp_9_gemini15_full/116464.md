词源:
The word "matelote" comes from the Old French word "matelot," meaning "sailor."  This connection likely stems from the fact that matelotes were traditionally simple, hearty stews easily prepared by sailors at sea.  The evolution of the word reflects the dish's historical association with maritime culture.
