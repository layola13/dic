词源:
The word "mercurialness" is derived from the adjective "mercurial," which ultimately comes from the Roman god Mercury (Greek: Hermes). Mercury was known for his swiftness, eloquence, and trickery, traits associated with rapid and unpredictable changes.  The adjective "mercurial" acquired its meaning of "changeable" or "fickle" through this association.  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun "mercurialness," signifying the state or quality of being mercurial.
