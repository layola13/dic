词源:  The word "dislodgment" comes from the verb "dislodge," which is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away" or "opposite") and the verb "lodge" (meaning "to place," "to reside," or "to become fixed").  The suffix "-ment" transforms the verb into a noun, indicating the act or process of dislodging.  Therefore, "dislodgment" literally means the act of removing or displacing something from its place.
