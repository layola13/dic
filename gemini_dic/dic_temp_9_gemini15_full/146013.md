overdoubts: /ˌoʊvərˈdaʊts/ | n. | 过度怀疑，疑虑重重 |  The word "overdoubts" is not a standard English word. It's a possible neologism (newly coined word) formed by combining "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great extent) with "doubts" (feelings of uncertainty or lack of conviction).  It suggests an excessive amount of doubt or skepticism.  There are no standard dictionaries that list it. To convey this meaning, one would typically use other phrases.
