近义词：unconventional, unorthodox, heterodox, unconventional, heretical


反义词：orthodox, conventional, traditional


词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "orthodox," which itself comes from the Greek words "orthos" (meaning "straight," "right," or "correct") and "doxa" (meaning "opinion" or "belief").  Therefore, "non-orthodox" literally means "not of right belief" or "not conforming to established beliefs."


用法说明:

This adjective is used to describe things, ideas, or people that deviate from what is considered normal, accepted, or traditional within a particular context.  The context is crucial, as what is considered "orthodox" varies across cultures, religions, and fields of study.

The word carries a slightly negative connotation, implying a departure from established norms that might be viewed with suspicion or disapproval, although it doesn't necessarily imply something is bad or wrong.  The effectiveness and acceptance of non-orthodox approaches often depend on the specific situation and the receptiveness of those involved.
