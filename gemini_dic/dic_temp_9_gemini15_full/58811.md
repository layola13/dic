The word "duon" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis according to your requested format.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:** Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please double-check the spelling.
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word, a word specific to a certain community or dialect, or slang.  If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it might help determine its meaning.
* **It's a word from another language:**  It could be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into standard English.  If you know the language of origin, please specify.


Without more information, a detailed analysis is impossible.
