词源:
The term "retro-futurism" is a relatively recent coinage, combining "retro" (from Latin *retro-, meaning "backward") and "futurism" (referring to the early 20th-century artistic and literary movement that celebrated technology and speed).  The concept itself, however, reflects a long-standing fascination with imagining the future from the perspective of a previous era.
