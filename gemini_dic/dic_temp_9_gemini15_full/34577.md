词源：

The term "clearing-house" emerged in the 19th century, reflecting its original function in the financial sector.  "Clearing" refers to the process of settling accounts or transactions, and "house" denotes a place or organization.  The combination thus signifies a place where financial transactions are settled and reconciled.  The usage has since broadened to encompass other contexts where information or goods are exchanged or processed in a centralized manner.
