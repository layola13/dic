词源:
From Old French *canvass, from Old French canevas, from Old French canevas "coarse linen, canvas," from Old French cane "reed," ultimately from Latin canna. The sense development is from the material used for painting to the act of thorough investigation, perhaps comparing the detailed scrutiny to the fine weave of canvas.
