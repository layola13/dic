WORD ORIGIN->

The word "hyperexaltation" is a compound word formed from:

* **hyper-:**  A prefix of Greek origin meaning "over," "above," "beyond," or "excessive."

* **exaltation:** A noun derived from the verb "exalt," which comes from the Old French word "exalter" and ultimately from the Latin "exaltare," meaning "to raise," "to elevate," or "to praise highly."


Therefore, hyperexaltation literally means "excessive elevation" or "excessive elation."
