preaccidentally: /ˌpriːˌæksɪˈdɛntəli/ | adv. | 事故发生前地；意外地（之前）|  This word is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, likely formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before) and "accidentally." It aims to describe something happening before an accident, often in a way that contributed to it.  However, its lack of established usage makes it unsuitable for formal writing or general communication.  A more appropriate phrasing would be needed depending on the context. For example, "before the accident," "prior to the incident," or phrases describing the specific actions leading up to the accident. |The preaccidentally faulty brakes contributed to the car crash. (This sentence uses the word, but it would be better phrased differently for clarity and correctness.)| before the accident, prior to the incident | after the accident, post-incident | adv.
