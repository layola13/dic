词源:
The etymology of "humper" is unclear.  It's likely a blend of words describing clumsy or awkward movement, possibly related to the verb "to hump," meaning to move awkwardly or to have sexual intercourse. The latter meaning contributes to its offensive usage.  The exact origin requires further linguistic research.
