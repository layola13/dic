词源:  The word "politicalism" is a relatively modern coinage, derived from "political" (from the Greek "politikos," meaning "of or relating to citizens") and the suffix "-ism," which typically indicates a doctrine, system, or practice.  It emerged as a way to describe the increasing influence and dominance of political considerations in various aspects of life.  It's not a word with a long and established history like many other political terms.
