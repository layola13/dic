The word "padar" is not a word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis following your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Providing the context where you encountered this word would be helpful.
2. **It's a word from another language:**  If so, please specify the language.  I can then attempt a translation and analysis.
3. **It's a neologism or slang:**  Newly coined words or slang terms aren't always found in dictionaries.  Again, context is crucial.
