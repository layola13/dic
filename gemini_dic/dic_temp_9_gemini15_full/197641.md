词源:
Sheriffalty derives from "sheriff" + "-alty," a suffix indicating "the state or quality of being," or "the office or jurisdiction of."  The word "sheriff" itself has Anglo-Saxon roots, ultimately deriving from the Old English *scīr-gerefa, meaning "shire reeve" (shire being a county, and reeve being an official).
