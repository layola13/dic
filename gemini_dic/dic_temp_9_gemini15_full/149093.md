oxbiter:/ˈɒksbaɪtər/ | n. | 屠夫；牛虻；(贬义)粗鲁的人 | A person who beats or abuses oxen; a cruel person;  a gadfly.  The term carries a strong negative connotation, suggesting brutality and cruelty, particularly towards animals. |例句：He was known as an oxbiter for his harsh treatment of his cattle. 他因残酷对待他的牛而被称为屠夫。


The term "oxbiter" is largely archaic and not frequently used in modern English.  Its meaning is primarily derived from its constituent parts: "ox" (牛) and "biter" (咬者，虐待者).  The word's origin lies in the historical practice of using oxen for labor, where mistreatment was sadly common.  Thus, an "oxbiter" was someone who would cruelly beat or abuse these animals.


The word's usage is almost exclusively limited to literature or historical contexts, aiming to portray a character's cruelty or ruthlessness.  It's rarely employed in everyday conversation.
