近义词：inter-system, cross-system, multi-system, integrated


反义词：isolated, independent, unconnected, compartmentalized


词源:  The word is a combination of "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among"), "system" (referring to a set of interacting or interdependent components), and "-atical" (an adjectival suffix).  It's a relatively modern coinage, reflecting the increasing complexity and interconnectedness of modern systems.  There's no single historical etymology as it's a constructed term.
