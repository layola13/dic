WORD ORIGIN->
The word "sinologist" is a relatively modern term.  It is formed from "Sino-", a combining form meaning "Chinese," derived from the Latin word *Sinae* (China), and "-logist," a suffix meaning "one who studies," from the Greek word *logos* (word, reason, study). Therefore, "sinologist" literally means "one who studies things Chinese."
