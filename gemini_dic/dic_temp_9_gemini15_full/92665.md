由于“ical”本身不是一个独立的单词，而是一个词缀，因此无法按照您提供的格式进行解析。  “ical”是一个形容词后缀，表示“与…相关的；…的”。  以下是对其词源和用法的说明：

/ˈɪkəl/ | suf. |  …的；与…相关的 |  The suffix "-ical" is derived from the Greek suffix "-ικός" (-ikos), which has the same meaning of forming adjectives. It signifies a relationship or connection to a noun or root word. | 例句：  Economical (经济的),  Political (政治的),  Biological (生物的) | 近义词:  -al, -ary, -ive (depending on the context) | 反义词:  无 (因为后缀本身没有反义)
