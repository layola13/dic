词源:  The word "shorthandedness" is derived from "shorthanded," which combines "short" (meaning lacking or deficient) and "handed" (referring to personnel or workforce). The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "shorthanded" into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being shorthanded.  The origin of "short" traces back to Old English "sceort," and "hand" comes from Old English "hand."
