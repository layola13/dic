The word "meteyard" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a technical term from a very specific field, or a proper noun.  If you can provide more context regarding where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
