词源:
The word "disestablishing" is formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") to "establishing," which comes from the verb "establish" (from Old French *establir, from Latin *stabulīre, "to make firm, settle"). Therefore, "disestablishing" literally means "the act of un-establishing" or "the act of making something not established."
