Word Origin:

The word "indiscernibilities" is derived from the adjective "indiscernible," which itself comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the verb "discern" (meaning "to perceive or recognize"), and the suffix "-ible" (meaning "capable of").  Therefore, "indiscernible" means "not capable of being perceived or recognized," and "indiscernibilities" refers to the instances or qualities of being indiscernible.
