Researchers have confirmed that this plant is indeed heterosporic. = 研究人员证实这种植物确实是异孢的。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the plant was thought to be homosporic, but it had actually been heterosporic all along. = 在发现之前，人们认为这种植物是同孢的，但实际上它一直都是异孢的。
It had been previously believed that only seed plants were heterosporic, but this understanding had changed. = 人们以前认为只有种子植物是异孢的，但这种理解已经改变了。


将来时:

疑问句:
Is this species of fern heterosporic or homosporic? = 这种蕨类植物是异孢的还是同孢的？

否定句:
This plant is not heterosporic; it is homosporic. = 这种植物不是异孢的；它是同孢的。
The study did not find evidence to support the hypothesis that this species is heterosporic. = 这项研究没有发现证据支持该物种是异孢的假设。
