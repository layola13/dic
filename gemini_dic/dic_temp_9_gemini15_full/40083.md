词源:

The word "contained" comes from the Old French word "contenir," which means "to hold together, to contain."  "Contenir" is derived from the Latin word "continēre," which is a combination of "com-" (together) and "tenēre" (to hold).  Therefore, the root meaning suggests the action of holding something within boundaries or limits.
