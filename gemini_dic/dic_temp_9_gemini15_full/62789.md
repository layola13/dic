词源:
From the adverbial form of the adjective *engrossed*, ultimately derived from the past participle of the verb *engross*, meaning "to occupy completely".  The verb *engross* itself comes from Old French *engrosser*, ultimately from Latin *in-*, "in," + *grossus*, "thick, large".  The sense evolution is from "to write in large letters" (thus making something large and occupying space) to "to occupy completely".
