paratomy:/pəˈrætəmi/| n. |旁体生殖，旁体发育|The asexual reproduction of an organism by the splitting off of a part of the body that regenerates into a new individual.  This process involves the development of an offspring from a part of the parent's body, rather than from specialized reproductive cells. This differs from fission, where the parent organism divides into two or more roughly equal parts.| Example:  Paratomy is a common form of asexual reproduction in some flatworms and other invertebrates.  旁体生殖是某些扁形虫和其他无脊椎动物中常见的一种无性生殖方式。|近义词：budding, fragmentation|反义词：sexual reproduction
