词源:
The word is a compound of "self-" (referring to oneself) and "neglectful" (failing to care for something or someone).  "Neglectful" derives from the Old French "negligencie" (negligence), ultimately from the Latin "negligentia," from "negligere" (to neglect), a combination of "nec" (not) and "ligere" (to gather, choose).
