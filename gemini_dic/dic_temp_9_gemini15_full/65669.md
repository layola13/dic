evection:/ɪˈvɛkʃən/| n. |拱点运动，偏心运动|An inequality in the motion of a celestial body, especially the Moon, due to the varying distance between the Earth and the Sun.  It is a periodic variation in the Moon's longitude caused by the Sun's gravitational pull. |Example: The evection of the Moon is a complex phenomenon influenced by the gravitational interaction between the Earth, Moon, and Sun. 月球的拱点运动是一个复杂的现象，受地球、月球和太阳之间引力相互作用的影响。|近义词：perturbation, irregularity |反义词：N/A
