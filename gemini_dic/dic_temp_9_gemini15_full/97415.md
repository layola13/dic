词源:

The word "infrugal" is formed by adding the negative prefix "in-" to the adjective "frugal."  "Frugal" comes from the Old French "frugal," ultimately deriving from the Latin "frugi" meaning "fruitful, productive, good, useful."  Therefore, "infrugal" literally means "not fruitful" or "not economical" in its original sense, evolving to mean wasteful and extravagant.
