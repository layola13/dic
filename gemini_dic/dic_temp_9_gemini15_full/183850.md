词源:

The word "resegregation" is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") and the noun "segregation" (the action or state of setting someone or something apart from others).  "Segregation" itself comes from the Latin word "segregare," meaning "to separate," which is formed from "se-" (apart) and "gregare" (to gather).  Therefore, "resegregation" literally means "to separate again."
