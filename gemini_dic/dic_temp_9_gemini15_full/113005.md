Etymology:

The word "lumberingly" is derived from the adverb "lumbering," which itself comes from the verb "lumber."  "Lumber" in this context ultimately traces its origins back to the Middle English word "lomberen," meaning "to move heavily or clumsily." This word may be related to Old Dutch "lomberen" with a similar meaning, suggesting a Germanic origin. The suffix "-ingly" is added to form the adverb, signifying the manner or way in which something is done.
