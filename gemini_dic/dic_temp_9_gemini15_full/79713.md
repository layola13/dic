glucoside:/ˈɡluːkəsaɪd/| n. |配糖体|A glucoside is a type of glycoside where the glycone (sugar) is glucose. Glucosides are found widely in plants and have various biological activities.  They are formed by a condensation reaction between a glucose molecule and another compound, often a phenol or alcohol. The bond between the glucose and the other compound is called a glycosidic bond.  Many glucosides have medicinal properties.| Example: Amygdalin is a glucoside found in the seeds of bitter almonds and apricots.  It releases hydrogen cyanide upon hydrolysis. |近义词：glycoside|反义词：无
