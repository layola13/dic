词源:
The word "pagan" ultimately derives from the Latin word "paganus," meaning "country dweller" or "rustic." In the late Roman Empire, the term came to be associated with those who lived in the countryside and continued to practice traditional, non-Christian religions, in contrast to the urban centers where Christianity was gaining prominence.  Over time, the meaning shifted to encompass any follower of a religion outside of the main Abrahamic faiths.
