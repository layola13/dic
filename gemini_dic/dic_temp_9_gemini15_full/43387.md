词源:
The verb "crank out" originates from the mechanical process of using a crank to operate a machine.  The image of a crank turning repeatedly to produce something implies the repetitive and often rushed nature of mass production.  The meaning evolved to describe the rapid production of items, often implying a lack of careful attention to detail.
