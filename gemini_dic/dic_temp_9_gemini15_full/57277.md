downrightnesses:/ˈdaʊnraɪtnəsɪz/| n.|彻底的正直；完全的正直|The word "downrightnesses" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  The root word "downright" means "thoroughly; completely; utterly," often used to emphasize a quality, either positive or negative.  Therefore, "downrightnesses" could potentially be interpreted as the plural form of a noun suggesting instances or examples of complete honesty or integrity, but this usage is highly unconventional and would not be understood in standard English.|例句：This sentence cannot be provided because the word is not standard English.|近义词:|N/A|反义词:|N/A|名词
