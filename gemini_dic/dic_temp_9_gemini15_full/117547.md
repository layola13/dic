megabits:/ˈmɛɡəbɪts/| n. |兆比特，百万比特|A megabit (Mb) is a unit of digital information equal to one million bits.  It's commonly used to express data transfer rates and storage capacities, especially in networking and telecommunications.|例句：The internet connection offers a download speed of 100 megabits per second. 这款网络连接提供每秒100兆比特的下载速度。The hard drive has a storage capacity of 500 megabits. 这块硬盘的存储容量为500兆比特。|近义词：millions of bits|反义词：kilobits, bytes


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The server transfers data at 100 megabits per second. = 服务器以每秒100兆比特的速度传输数据。
This modem supports up to 10 megabits. = 这款调制解调器支持高达10兆比特。


一般过去时:
The download speed was only 5 megabits per second yesterday. = 昨天的下载速度只有每秒5兆比特。
The old network transferred data at much lower megabits. = 旧网络的数据传输速率低得多（以兆比特计）。


现在完成时:
We have downloaded 100 megabits of data this morning. = 我们今天早上已经下载了100兆比特的数据。
The company has upgraded its network to handle higher megabits. = 公司已经升级了其网络以处理更高的兆比特速率。


过去完成时:
They had already transferred 500 megabits before the system crashed. = 系统崩溃之前，他们已经传输了500兆比特的数据。
The project had consumed more than a terabit, including megabits.  = 该项目已经消耗了超过1太比特的数据，包括兆比特。


将来时:
The new router will support gigabits, exceeding megabits significantly. = 新路由器将支持千兆比特，大大超过兆比特。
We will need to increase our bandwidth to handle higher megabits. = 我们需要增加带宽以处理更高的兆比特速率。


虚拟语气:
If the connection were faster (in megabits), the download would be complete by now. = 如果连接速度更快（以兆比特计），下载现在就完成了。
I wish the upload speed were higher in megabits. = 我希望上传速度以兆比特计更快。


被动语态:
The data was transferred at 20 megabits per second. = 数据以每秒20兆比特的速度传输。
The maximum megabits supported by this device is 100. = 此设备支持的最大兆比特数为100。


疑问句:
What is the data transfer rate in megabits? = 数据传输速率是多少兆比特？
How many megabits are available on this network? = 此网络上有多少兆比特可用？


否定句:
The network doesn't support megabits above 10. = 该网络不支持超过10兆比特的速度。
The download speed wasn't as high as advertised in megabits. = 下载速度不如广告中宣传的那样高（以兆比特计）。


PHRASE->
megabits per second (Mbps) = 每秒兆比特
peak megabits = 峰值兆比特
available megabits = 可用兆比特
megabits download = 兆比特下载
megabits upload = 兆比特上传
