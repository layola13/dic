The word "fendy" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  If you can provide more context (sentence, conversation) where you encountered "fendy," it might be possible to guess the intended word.

2. **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name (person, place, or brand) or a neologism (newly coined word).

3. **It's a word from a different language:**  It could be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.


Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  Please clarify the context of "fendy."
