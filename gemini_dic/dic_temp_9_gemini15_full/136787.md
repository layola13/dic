WORD ORIGIN:

The word is formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" (pluralizing suffix for abstract nouns) to the adjective "nonserviceable".  "Nonserviceable" itself is a combination of "non-" (negative prefix) and "serviceable" (capable of being used or performing a service).  "Serviceable" comes from "service" + "-able" (suffix indicating capability).  Ultimately, the root is "service," which has its origins in Old French and Latin roots related to serving or being helpful.
