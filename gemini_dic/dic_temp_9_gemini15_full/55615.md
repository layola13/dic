词源:
dis- (否定前缀) + vouch (担保，保证)  The word ultimately derives from Old French *voucher, meaning "to guarantee," from Vulgar Latin *vocare ("to call," "to summon").  The sense of "to vouch for" developed from the idea of calling someone to testify or guarantee something.  The addition of "dis-" creates the opposite meaning.
