词源:

The word "pate" comes from the Old French word "paste," meaning "paste" or "dough."  Its culinary meaning evolved from the original sense of a thick, spreadable mixture.  The use of "pate" to refer to the head is a separate, though related, development.  It shares a common ancestor with words like "pastry."
