isoallele: /ˌaɪsoʊˈæliːl/ | n. | 等位基因 | An isoallele is a variant form of a gene that produces a slightly different protein with little or no detectable phenotypic effect.  These variations are often silent mutations, meaning they don't alter the amino acid sequence of the protein, or they cause minor changes that don't significantly affect the protein's function.  Isoalleles are contrasted with alloalleles, which produce significantly different phenotypes. | Example:  The study identified several isoalleles of the gene responsible for eye color, resulting in subtle variations in shade.  这项研究确定了负责眼睛颜色的基因的几个等位基因，导致色调的细微变化。| 近义词:  silent mutation, neutral mutation | 反义词: alloallele
