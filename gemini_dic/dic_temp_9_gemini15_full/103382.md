词源:

The term "jingoism" originated in the late 19th century, derived from a popular patriotic song, "The Song of Jingo," which celebrated British imperialism and militarism.  The word "Jingo" itself was possibly a nonsense word used in the song.  Its rapid adoption as a term for aggressive nationalism reflected the public's perception of the song's message.
