nonylic: /nənˈɪlɪk/ | adj. |壬基的；九碳的 | Relating to or denoting a chemical compound containing a nonyl group (a nine-carbon alkyl group).  Nonyl groups are common in many organic compounds, including some surfactants and fragrances. | Example:  The nonylic acid derivative showed promising antifungal properties.  壬基酸衍生物显示出有前景的抗真菌特性。| 近义词: nonanoyl | 反义词:  (no direct antonym, but could be described as the opposite of a shorter alkyl chain, e.g., methyl, ethyl)
