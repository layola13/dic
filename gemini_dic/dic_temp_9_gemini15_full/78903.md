The word "{giovani}" is not a word in standard English.  It appears to be an attempt to spell the Italian word "giovani," which means "young men" or "young people."  Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis in the requested format for a non-existent English word.  If you meant the Italian word, I can provide information about it, but it won't fit perfectly into the English-word analysis structure.
