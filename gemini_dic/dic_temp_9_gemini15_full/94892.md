词源:
The phrase "in the event of" is a formal way of saying "if."  "Event" comes from the Old French word *event*, meaning "outcome, result," ultimately deriving from the Latin *eventus*, past participle of *evenire*, "to happen, come out."  The preposition "in" indicates circumstances or context.  The phrase's formal nature makes it suitable for official documents and announcements.
