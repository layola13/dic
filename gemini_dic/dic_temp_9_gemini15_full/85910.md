词源:  Derived from "heady," meaning "intoxicating; impetuous; reckless."  The suffix "-ness" indicates a state or quality, and the further suffix "-es" denotes the plural.  The root can be traced back to Old English "heafod" (head), suggesting a loss of control associated with being "over the head" or overwhelmed by emotion or intoxicants.
