peregrines:/ˈpɛrəɡrɪnz/| n.|猎隼；漂泊者；旅行者|From the Latin *peregrinus*, meaning "foreigner, stranger, traveler," ultimately from *peregri*, meaning "to travel abroad."  The word originally referred to travelers or foreigners, but its application shifted to the peregrine falcon due to the bird's wide-ranging migratory patterns.  |例句：Peregrine falcons are known for their incredible speed during dives.  猎隼以其俯冲时的惊人速度而闻名。

The peregrine falcon is a magnificent peregrine. 猎隼是一种雄伟的漂泊者。（引申义）
