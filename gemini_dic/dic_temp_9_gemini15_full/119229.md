词源:

The word "miasmal" derives from the Greek word "miasma" (μιασμα), meaning "pollution," "contagion," or "defilement."  In ancient Greece, miasma referred to noxious exhalations believed to cause disease. This concept was later adopted and adapted in various cultures, influencing the understanding and vocabulary surrounding disease transmission.  The "-al" suffix transforms the noun "miasma" into an adjective.
