self-stabilities: /ˌsɛlf ˈsteɪbəlɪtiz/ | n. | 自稳定性 | The inherent ability of a system to return to a stable state after a disturbance.  This term often refers to the capacity of a system to maintain its equilibrium without external intervention. It's commonly used in various fields like engineering, physics, ecology and economics.  |  The self-stabilities of the ecosystem were tested by the severe drought.  生态系统的自稳定性受到了严重干旱的考验。 The bridge's self-stabilities were crucial for its ability to withstand strong winds. 桥梁的自稳定性对其承受强风的关键能力至关重要。 |  stability, equilibrium, resilience | instability, chaos, fragility | 名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and does not conjugate like verbs.  Therefore, grammatical tenses (present, past, future etc.) and voice (active/passive) do not apply to "self-stabilities" itself.  However, we can use it in sentences with verbs that reflect the state or changes of self-stabilities.


Example sentences showing different aspects:

Present Tense: The system exhibits remarkable self-stabilities.  系统表现出显著的自稳定性。
Past Tense: The self-stabilities of the structure were compromised by the earthquake. 结构的自稳定性因地震而受损。
Future Tense:  Engineers are predicting high self-stabilities for the new design. 工程师们预测新设计将具有很高的自稳定性。


PHRASE->
high self-stabilities 高自稳定性
low self-stabilities 低自稳定性
improved self-stabilities  改进的自稳定性
testing self-stabilities 测试自稳定性
assessing self-stabilities  评估自稳定性

Word Origin:

The word is a compound formed from "self-" (meaning inherent or intrinsic) and "stabilities" (the plural of stability, meaning the state of being stable or resistant to change).  "Stability" originates from the Latin word "stabilis," meaning "firm," "steady," or "fixed."
