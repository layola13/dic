noncrystallized:/ˌnɒnˈkrɪstəlaɪzd/ | adj. |非晶体的，无定形的 | Not having a crystalline structure; amorphous.  Noncrystallized materials lack the ordered, repeating three-dimensional structure characteristic of crystals. They are often formed through rapid cooling or other processes that prevent the atoms or molecules from arranging themselves into a regular lattice. | Example:  The rapidly cooled lava formed a noncrystallized, glassy rock.  快速冷却的熔岩形成了非晶质的玻璃状岩石。|近义词：amorphous, glassy, vitreous | 反义词：crystalline


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The substance is noncrystallized. =这种物质是非晶体的。
This material remains noncrystallized even after heating. =即使加热后，这种材料仍然是非晶体的。

一般过去时:
The solution was noncrystallized. =溶液是非晶体的。
The glass was noncrystallized at the time of its formation. =玻璃在形成时是非晶体的。

现在完成时:
The scientists have confirmed that the material has remained noncrystallized. =科学家们已经证实该材料一直保持非晶态。
The researchers have discovered a new method to create noncrystallized polymers. =研究人员发现了一种制造非晶态聚合物的新方法。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, the sample had been noncrystallized. =实验前，样品是非晶体的。
They had ensured the substance remained noncrystallized prior to analysis. =在分析之前，他们确保物质保持非晶态。

将来时:
The product will be noncrystallized after the rapid cooling process. =快速冷却过程后，产品将是非晶体的。
This mixture will likely remain noncrystallized under these conditions. =在这种条件下，这种混合物很可能保持非晶态。


虚拟语气:
If the cooling process were slower, the substance would not be noncrystallized. =如果冷却过程慢一些，物质就不会是非晶体的。
It is important that the material remain noncrystallized for this application. =对于此应用，重要的是材料保持非晶态。


被动语态:
The material was described as noncrystallized in the report. =报告中将该材料描述为非晶体的。
The structure is believed to be noncrystallized due to the rapid solidification. =由于快速凝固，据信该结构是非晶体的。


疑问句:
Is the resulting product noncrystallized? =最终产品是非晶体的吗？
Are all glasses noncrystallized? =所有玻璃都是非晶体的吗？

否定句:
The substance is not noncrystallized; it has a crystalline structure. =该物质不是非晶体的；它具有晶体结构。
The sample was not completely noncrystallized; some crystalline regions were observed. =样品并非完全是非晶体的；观察到一些晶体区域。


PHRASE->
noncrystallized glass 非晶态玻璃
noncrystallized polymer 非晶态聚合物
noncrystallized silicon 非晶态硅
noncrystallized structure 非晶结构
noncrystallized material 非晶态材料


词源:
The word "noncrystallized" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "crystallized" (meaning "having a crystalline structure").  "Crystallized" itself derives from "crystal," ultimately from the Greek word "krustallos," meaning "ice" or "rock crystal."
