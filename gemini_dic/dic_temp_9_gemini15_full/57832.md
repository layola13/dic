The origin of "dressed to the nines" is uncertain, but several theories exist.  One popular theory links it to the phrase "dressed to the nines and tens," referring to the highest possible number on a dice (nine being the highest single roll, and ten being a double six). Another suggests a connection to "dressed to kill," implying that the attire is so impressive it is almost dangerous or threatening in its effect.  However, the exact etymology remains debated.
