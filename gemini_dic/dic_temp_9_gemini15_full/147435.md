/ˌoʊvərəʊˈbiːsənɛsɪz/ | n. |过度肥胖症；极度肥胖的状况 |  The word "overobesenesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a non-standard formation, possibly an attempt to emphasize the extreme degree of obesity.  It combines "over" (meaning excessively) with "obeseness" (a less common variant of "obesity"). The use of the plural "-esses" further amplifies the sense of multiplicity or severity.  There is no established meaning or usage in dictionaries or corpora.  Therefore, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage in the requested format is impossible.  The word should be avoided in formal writing and replaced with more appropriate and accurate terms such as "extreme obesity," "morbid obesity," or "severe obesity." |  No example sentences can be provided as the word is not in common use. | 近义词：extreme obesity, morbid obesity, severe obesity | 反义词：None directly applicable, as it describes a condition, not a quality with a direct opposite. | n.
