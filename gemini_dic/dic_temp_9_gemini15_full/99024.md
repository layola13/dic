The word "interagree" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information following the requested format.  It may be a misspelling, a newly coined word, or a word specific to a particular field or community.  If you could provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
