词源:
The word "preinscription" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the noun "inscription," which comes from the Latin words "in-" (meaning "in" or "on") and "scribere" (meaning "to write").  Therefore, "preinscription" literally means "a writing or marking before."  The modern usage extends this to include the act of registering in advance.
