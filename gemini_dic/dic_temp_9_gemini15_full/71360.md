词源:
The word "flag" ultimately derives from the Old Norse word *flagga, meaning "a piece of cloth," or possibly from a Proto-Germanic word with a similar meaning.  The meaning evolved to include the symbolic use of cloth as a standard or banner. The verb sense of "to flag" (to signal with a flag) followed naturally from the noun meaning.
