词源:
The word "refurnishment" is derived from the verb "refurnish," which is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the verb "furnish" (meaning "to provide or equip with what is needed").  Therefore, "refurnishment" literally means "the act of furnishing again" or "supplying again."  The meaning has expanded to include not just the furnishing of items (like furniture), but also the replenishment of supplies or the renovation of a space.
