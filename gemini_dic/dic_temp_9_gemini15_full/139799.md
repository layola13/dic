octet's:/ˈɒktɛts/ | n. |八位字节的；八重奏的 | An octet is a group of eight bits, or a set of eight things.  It's often used in computing and networking to refer to a byte.  The possessive form "octet's" indicates belonging to an octet. | Example: The network packet's size is measured in octets.  网络数据包的大小以八位字节为单位测量。 The octet's value was crucial to the encryption. 八位字节的值对加密至关重要。|近义词：byte (in computing context), eight-bit group |反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The octet represents a single character. = 八位字节代表单个字符。
Each octet contains eight bits. = 每个八位字节包含八位。


一般过去时:
The octet transmitted successfully. = 八位字节成功传输。
The system processed the octet rapidly. = 系统快速处理了八位字节。


现在完成时:
The program has processed all the octets. = 程序已处理所有八位字节。
We have received the data in octets. = 我们已经以八位字节的形式接收了数据。


过去完成时:
The program had processed the octet before the error occurred. = 错误发生之前，程序已经处理了该八位字节。
They had transmitted all the octets before the connection dropped. = 连接中断之前，他们已经传输了所有八位字节。


将来时:
The system will send the data as octets. = 系统将以八位字节的形式发送数据。
The program will interpret each octet individually. = 程序将单独解释每个八位字节。


虚拟语气:
If the octet were corrupted, the data would be lost. = 如果八位字节损坏，数据将会丢失。
I wish the octet's value had been different. = 我希望八位字节的值有所不同。


被动语态:
The octet was misinterpreted by the software. = 八位字节被软件误解了。
The octets are being transmitted over the network. = 八位字节正在通过网络传输。


疑问句:
How many octets are in the message? = 消息中有多少个八位字节？
What is the value of this octet? = 这个八位字节的值是多少？


否定句:
The octet was not correctly aligned. = 八位字节没有正确对齐。
The system did not recognize the octet. = 系统没有识别该八位字节。


PHRASE->
octet stream = 八位字节流
octet-oriented protocol = 面向八位字节的协议
octet counting = 八位字节计数
octet alignment = 八位字节对齐
octet boundary = 八位字节边界
