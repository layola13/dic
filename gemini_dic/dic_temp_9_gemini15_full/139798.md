octet:/ˈɑːktɛt/ | n. |八位字节，八位组 | A group of eight bits; a byte.  In networking, an octet is used to represent a single character or a small number. |Example:  An IP address is composed of four octets.  一个IP地址由四个八位字节组成。|近义词：byte (in some contexts)|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The program processes the data in octets. = 程序以八位字节处理数据。
Each character is represented by one octet. = 每个字符由一个八位字节表示。


一般过去时:
The system received the message in octets. = 系统以八位字节接收信息。
The old system transmitted data as octets. = 旧系统以八位字节传输数据。


现在完成时:
We have transmitted thousands of octets of data. = 我们已经传输了数千字节的数据。
The server has received all the octets. = 服务器已经接收了所有八位字节。


过去完成时:
The program had already processed all the received octets. = 程序已经处理了所有接收到的八位字节。
Before the error, the system had correctly transmitted all octets. = 在出错之前，系统已正确传输所有八位字节。


将来时:
The new system will transmit data in octets. = 新系统将以八位字节传输数据。
We will need to convert the data into octets. = 我们需要将数据转换成八位字节。


虚拟语气:
If the data were sent in octets, the transmission would be more efficient. = 如果数据以八位字节发送，传输效率会更高。
I wish the data had been sent as octets. = 我希望数据是以八位字节发送的。


被动语态:
The data is processed in octets by the system. = 数据由系统以八位字节处理。
The message was received as octets. = 消息以八位字节接收。


疑问句:
Are the data being transmitted as octets? = 数据正在以八位字节传输吗？
How many octets are in the message? = 消息中有多少个八位字节？


否定句:
The system does not process data in octets. = 系统不以八位字节处理数据。
The message was not sent as octets. = 消息不是以八位字节发送的。


PHRASE->
octet stream = 八位字节流
octet string = 八位字节串
octet aligned = 八位字节对齐
octet count = 八位字节计数
data octet = 数据八位字节
