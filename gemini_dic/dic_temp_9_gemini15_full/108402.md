词源:  The word "lawlessnesses" is derived from "lawlessness," which combines "law" (Old English *lagu)  meaning "law, right, custom" and the suffix "-less" (Old English -lēas) meaning "without."  The addition of "-ness" (Old English -nes) creates the noun form indicating a state or quality.  The final "-es" is the plural marker.
