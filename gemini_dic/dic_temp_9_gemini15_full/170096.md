protist:/ˈproʊtɪst/| n. |原生生物；单细胞生物|A protist is any eukaryotic organism that is not an animal, plant, or fungus.  Protists are a diverse group of organisms that can be single-celled or multicellular, and they inhabit a wide range of environments.  They are typically microscopic in size and play crucial roles in various ecosystems.|Example:  Amoebas and paramecia are examples of protists.|近义词：microorganism (广义)|反义词：None (没有明确的反义词，因为这是一个分类术语)|名词


USAGE->

New protist species are constantly being discovered. = 不断有新的原生生物物种被发现。


疑问句:
What type of protist is this? = 这是什么类型的原生生物？
Are all protists single-celled? = 所有原生生物都是单细胞的吗？


否定句:
That organism is not a protist. = 那个生物不是原生生物。

PHRASE->

protist diversity = 原生生物多样性
protist ecology = 原生生物生态学
protist evolution = 原生生物进化
protist morphology = 原生生物形态学
protist genetics = 原生生物遗传学

词源:

The word "protist" comes from the Greek word "protos," meaning "first" or "primary."  It reflects the early understanding that these organisms were among the earliest forms of eukaryotic life.
