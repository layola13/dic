Etymology:  The word "edification" comes from the Middle English word "edifiacioun," which itself derives from the Old French word "edification" and ultimately from the Latin word "aedificatio," meaning "a building up."  The Latin verb "aedificare" means "to build," combining "aedificium" (building) and "-are" (verb suffix).  Therefore, the core meaning revolves around the idea of building up or constructing something, in this case, moral or intellectual character.
