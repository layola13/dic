semifunctionalism:/ˌsɛmiˈfʌŋkʃənəlɪzəm/| n. |半功能主义|Semifunctionalism is a sociological perspective that combines elements of functionalism and conflict theory. It acknowledges the existence of social order and stability (functionalism), but also recognizes the role of power struggles, inequality, and conflict in shaping social structures (conflict theory). Unlike pure functionalism, which emphasizes social harmony and consensus, semifunctionalism acknowledges that social systems are not always perfectly integrated or stable, and that conflicts and inequalities can contribute to social change.  |The study explored semifunctionalism in the context of urban development, examining how both functional needs and power dynamics influenced the allocation of resources. |近义词：sociological perspective, social theory |反义词：pure functionalism, pure conflict theory
