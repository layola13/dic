homonymity:/ˌhɒmˈɒnɪməti/| /ˌhoʊˈɑːnɪməti/ | n. |同音异义词现象|The state or quality of being a homonym; the existence of homonyms in a language.  It refers to the linguistic phenomenon where two or more words have the same spelling and pronunciation but different meanings.  The study of homonymity often involves exploring the etymological roots and semantic evolution of words to understand how such similar forms can develop distinct meanings.| Example: The word "bank" can refer to a financial institution or the land alongside a river; this illustrates homonymity.  The existence of homonyms like "bank" (river bank vs. financial bank) is an example of homonymity.|近义词:polysemy (although polysemy refers to multiple related meanings within a single word, while homonymity refers to unrelated meanings), lexical ambiguity|反义词:  There isn't a direct antonym, but the opposite concept could be described as "unique spelling and pronunciation for each meaning."|名词
