latino:/læˈtiːnoʊ/ | adj. n. | 拉丁美洲人；拉丁美洲的 | Relating to Latin America or its people.  The term is often used to refer to people of Latin American descent, regardless of race.  However, its usage can be complex and sometimes considered controversial due to its broad scope and potential for overlooking individual ethnicities. | 例句：He is a Latino from Puerto Rico. 他是来自波多黎各的拉丁美洲人。  | 例句：The restaurant serves authentic Latino cuisine. 这家餐馆供应正宗的拉丁美洲菜肴。| 近义词：Hispanic (often used interchangeably, but with subtle differences), Latinx (a more inclusive term)| 反义词：None directly, but terms specifying a non-Latin American ethnicity could be considered contrasting.
