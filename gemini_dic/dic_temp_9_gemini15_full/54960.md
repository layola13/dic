词源:

The word "disprofess" is a combination of the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the verb "profess."  "Profess" itself comes from the Latin word "professus," the past participle of "profiteri," meaning "to declare openly," "to avow," or "to acknowledge."


用法说明:

Disprofess is a relatively formal and infrequent word. It implies a strong and public rejection of a previously held belief, affiliation, or relationship.  The act of disprofessing is often deliberate and intended to sever ties completely.  It carries a stronger connotation than simply denying something.  The denial is explicit and often made in a public forum.
