WORD ORIGIN->
The term is a compound word combining "empire" and "building".  "Empire" derives from Old French "empire," ultimately from Latin "imperium," meaning "command, power, dominion." "Building" comes from Old English "byldan," meaning "to build."  Thus, "empire-building" literally means "the act of building an empire."
