词源:  The word "salver" ultimately derives from the Old French word "salvere," meaning "to save" or "to preserve." This likely refers to its original function of safely carrying and presenting valuable items.  The connection is indirect, as the word evolved through various forms and meanings over time.  The modern meaning of "serving tray" developed gradually.
