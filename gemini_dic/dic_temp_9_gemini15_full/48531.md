词源:
The word "deface" comes from the Old French word "desfacer," which itself is a combination of "des-" (meaning "to undo" or "away") and "facer" (meaning "to make").  Therefore, the literal meaning points towards "undoing the making" or "unmaking the face" of something.  The evolution of its meaning to encompass the damaging of surfaces and appearances is a natural progression from this root.
