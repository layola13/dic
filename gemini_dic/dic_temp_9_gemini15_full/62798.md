词源:
The word "engulf" comes from the Old English words "in-" (meaning "in" or "into") and "gulf" (meaning "a large gulf or abyss").  The "gulf" part itself comes from Old French "golfe," ultimately from Arabic "khilj" (meaning "gulf, bay"). Therefore, the word literally means "to be swallowed up into a gulf".
