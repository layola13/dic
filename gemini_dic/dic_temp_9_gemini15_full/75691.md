fulgurite:/ˈfʌlɡəraɪt/ | n. |雷击石，闪电熔岩 | A fulgurite is a natural glass tube formed when lightning strikes sand or soil. The intense heat of the lightning melts the silica in the sand, creating a glassy structure that can be hollow or filled with sand.  Fulgurites can vary greatly in size and shape, depending on the intensity of the lightning strike and the composition of the soil. |例句：The geologist discovered a remarkable fulgurite, perfectly preserved after a thousand years. 地质学家发现了一块保存完好的雷击石，已经有千年历史了。

The researchers found evidence of multiple fulgurites at the site, suggesting repeated lightning strikes. 研究人员在现场发现了多处雷击石的证据，这表明曾多次发生雷击。
