词源:
The word "crank" ultimately derives from the Middle Dutch word *cranc, meaning "sickle," "hook," or "bent object."  This refers to the bent shape of the tool used to turn a crankshaft.  The verb sense of "to operate a crank" followed naturally from the noun's meaning.  The extended meanings of "to work hard" and "to produce something forcefully" are metaphorical extensions of the original mechanical sense.
