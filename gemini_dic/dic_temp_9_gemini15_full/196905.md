词源:  The word ultimately derives from the Old English word "sceadu," meaning "shadow."  Over time,  "shady" acquired its figurative meaning of being suspicious or secretive, likely due to the association of shadows with hidden or clandestine activities. The "-est" suffix denotes the superlative form.
