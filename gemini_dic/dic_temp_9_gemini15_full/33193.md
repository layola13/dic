chromoplastic:/ˌkroʊməˈplæstɪk/| adj.|有色体(的)，色素体的|Containing or relating to chromoplasts.  Chromoplasts are plastids that synthesize and store pigments other than chlorophyll, giving fruits, flowers, and roots their characteristic colors.  They are responsible for the vibrant colors in many plants.| Example: The chromoplastic pigments in carrots give them their orange hue.  胡萝卜中的有色体色素赋予其橙色色调。|近义词：pigmented, colored|反义词：chlorophyllous (containing chlorophyll)|词性:形容词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The chromoplasts in these peppers are responsible for their red color. = 这些辣椒中的有色体导致了它们的红色。
These flowers display vibrant chromoplastic pigments. = 这些花展示着鲜艳的有色体色素。


一般过去时:
Scientists studied the chromoplastic development in the fruit. = 科学家研究了果实中色素体的发育。
The chromoplasts in the leaves degraded during autumn. = 秋天叶子中的有色体降解了。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several types of chromoplasts. = 研究人员已经鉴定了几种类型的色素体。
The plant has accumulated chromoplastic pigments in its roots. = 植物在其根部积累了有色体色素。


过去完成时:
Before ripening, the fruit had lacked chromoplastic pigments. = 在成熟之前，果实缺乏有色体色素。
The leaves had already lost their chromoplastic pigments before they fell. = 叶子在掉落之前就已经失去了有色体色素。


将来时:
Scientists will study how chromoplasts change color. = 科学家将研究色素体如何改变颜色。
The plant will develop more chromoplasts as it matures. = 植物在成熟时会发育出更多的色素体。


虚拟语气:
If the plant had more chromoplasts, it would be more colorful. = 如果植物有更多的色素体，它就会更鲜艳。
