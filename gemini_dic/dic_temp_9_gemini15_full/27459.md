词源:
The word "camp-follower" is a compound word.  "Camp" refers to a military encampment, and "follower" indicates someone who follows or accompanies the camp. The term's origins trace back to the medieval and early modern periods when large armies traveled with numerous non-combatants providing services and supplies.  The connotation often shifted to negative over time due to the opportunistic and sometimes exploitative nature of some individuals in this role.
