词源:  Derived from the noun "cavalier," meaning a knight or gentleman, but also carrying the connotation of arrogance and disdain.  The "-ing" suffix transforms it into a gerund, representing the act of behaving in a cavalier manner.  The word's evolution reflects a shift in meaning from a description of a type of person to a description of a behavior.
