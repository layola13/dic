词源:

The word "crosswise" is a combination of "cross" and "wise."  "Cross" originates from Old English "crūc," referring to a cross-shaped object or the act of crossing. "-wise" is an Old English suffix indicating manner or direction.  Therefore, "crosswise" literally means "in the manner of a cross."
