词源:

The word "litigative" is derived from the Latin word "litigare," meaning "to carry on a lawsuit" or "to contend."  The suffix "-ative" is added to create an adjective meaning "having the nature of" or "tending to."


用法说明：

Litigative is primarily used to describe a person or an organization that is inclined to engage in lawsuits or legal battles. It implies a propensity for conflict resolution through the courts rather than through negotiation or other means.  The word carries a slightly negative connotation, suggesting that the person or organization is overly prone to legal action, perhaps even excessively so.  It can also describe something that is likely to lead to litigation.
