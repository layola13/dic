词源:
The word "disparage" comes from the Old French word "desparager," which literally means "to make unequal" or "to mismatch."  It's built from the prefix "des-" (meaning "away from" or "opposite of") and "parager," which is related to the Latin word "par" (meaning "equal").  Therefore, the original sense was about creating inequality or unsuitability, which evolved into the modern meaning of belittling or speaking ill of someone or something.
