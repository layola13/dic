optigraph:/ˈɒptɪɡræf/| n. |视力图，最佳图像|A visual representation, often a graph or chart, displaying optimal or best-fit results.  It often shows the best possible outcome or configuration based on given data or parameters. For example, in machine learning, an optigraph might display the performance of a model across different hyperparameter settings, highlighting the optimal configuration.|Example: The optigraph clearly showed that a learning rate of 0.01 yielded the best model accuracy.|近义词：optimum chart, best-fit graph|反义词：worst-case scenario graph, suboptimal visualization|名词


USAGE->
This word is quite specialized and doesn't lend itself to typical grammatical tenses and structures like "what" does.  The usage is primarily descriptive, presenting data visually.  There's no conjugation or tense changes to illustrate. Examples would be focusing on how to interpret the optigraph itself, rather than grammatical structures.


Example 1:  "The optigraph indicated the optimal temperature for the reaction was 37 degrees Celsius."  = 视力图显示反应的最佳温度是摄氏37度。

Example 2: "Analyzing the optigraph, the research team determined the most effective drug dosage." = 通过分析视力图，研究团队确定了最有效的药物剂量。


PHRASE->
Because "optigraph" is a noun referring to a specific type of visual representation, typical phrases are related to its interpretation and usage within a specific context, rather than fixed phrases.  Examples would depend heavily on the field it's used in (e.g., machine learning, engineering, etc.).  Instead of providing common phrases, here are examples of how it might be used in a sentence:

Example 1: "According to the optigraph, the system is performing at peak efficiency." = 根据视力图，系统正以最佳效率运行。

Example 2: "The detailed optigraph allowed for precise calibration of the equipment." = 详细的视力图允许对设备进行精确校准。

Example 3: "Examine the optigraph for areas of potential improvement." = 检查视力图以查找潜在改进的领域。

Example 4: "The optigraph clearly visualizes the relationship between variables." = 视力图清楚地显示了变量之间的关系。

Example 5: "Generating the optigraph requires complex algorithms." = 生成视力图需要复杂的算法。
