词源:  From Middle French *desultorie, from Latin desultor "a vaulter," from de- "off, away" + salire "to leap."  The original sense referred to a person who leaped from one horse to another, thus implying a lack of consistent focus.  The modern meaning evolved from this to describe something lacking in consistency or purpose.
