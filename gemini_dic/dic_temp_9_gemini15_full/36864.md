color-force:/ˈkʌlər fɔːrs/| n. |色力，彩色力|In physics, specifically quantum chromodynamics (QCD), color force refers to the strong interaction between quarks mediated by gluons.  It's responsible for binding quarks together to form hadrons such as protons and neutrons. Unlike other fundamental forces, the color force increases with distance, leading to quark confinement.|例句：The color force is responsible for holding protons and neutrons together in the atomic nucleus. 色力负责将质子和中子结合在原子核中。The strong color force prevents quarks from existing in isolation. 强烈的色力阻止夸克单独存在。|近义词：strong interaction, strong nuclear force|反义词：weak force, electromagnetic force|名词
