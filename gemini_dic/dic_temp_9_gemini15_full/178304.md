词源:

The word "reconcilements" comes from the verb "reconcile," which has Latin roots.  "Re-" is a prefix meaning "again" or "back," "con-" means "together," and "-ciliare" is related to "cilium," meaning "eyelid," suggesting a metaphorical closing of the eyes to past differences.  Therefore, "reconcile" originally meant to restore to friendship or harmony. The "-ments" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, indicating the act or process of reconciling or the state of being reconciled.
