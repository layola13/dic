dipleidoscope:/daɪˈplɪskəʊp/| n. |双视镜，双像镜|A dipleidoscope is an optical instrument used to measure the double refraction of light in crystals. It consists of two Nicol prisms arranged so that their principal planes are at right angles to each other.  Light passing through the first prism is polarized, and the second prism analyzes the polarization of the light after it has passed through the crystal. The angle through which the second prism must be rotated to extinguish the light gives a measure of the double refraction. |The geologist used a dipleidoscope to analyze the birefringence of the mineral sample.|近义词： polariscope, refractometer |反义词：无
