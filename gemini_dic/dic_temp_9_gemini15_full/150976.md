PHRASE->
Common phrases using "parametral" are less frequent than with common words like "what."  The word tends to be used within specific technical contexts.  Phrases are often formed based on the noun it modifies, such as "parametral analysis," "parametral model," "parametral study."  Therefore, listing phrases as in the "what" example wouldn't be relevant here.
