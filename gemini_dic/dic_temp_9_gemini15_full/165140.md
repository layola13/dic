The word "preindependences" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, or possibly a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a meaningful response, we need to consider the possibilities:

**Possibility 1: Misspelling**

It might be a misspelling of words like:

* **Pre-independence:** This is a common term referring to the time period before a nation gains independence.  This is the most likely intended meaning.

    * /ˌpriːɪnˈdɪpɛndəns/ | adj. | 独立之前的 |  Referring to the era before a country achieves independence.  Examples of its use would be in historical contexts.


    * Example: "Pre-independence movements often involved significant social and political upheaval."  独立前的运动往往伴随着重大的社会和政治动荡。

    * There are no direct antonyms, but "post-independence" is the opposite.  There aren't direct synonyms either; the meaning is context-dependent.



* **Pre-independence era/period/days:** These phrases are used to specify the time before independence.

**Possibility 2:  Neologism (newly coined word)**

If it is a deliberate neologism, we would need more context to understand its intended meaning and usage.


**In summary:**  Without additional context or clarification, a full grammatical analysis of "preindependences" as requested is not feasible. The most probable interpretation is that it's a misspelling of "pre-independence" used adjectivally.  A proper analysis can only be done with the correct word and its usage in a sentence.
