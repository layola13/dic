词源:
The word "recureless" is a combination of the prefix "re-" (again, back) and the word "cureless," meaning "without a cure."  "Cureless" itself derives from "cure" (to heal or restore to health) plus the suffix "-less" (without).  Therefore, "recureless" implies a condition beyond the possibility of being cured, even with repeated attempts.
