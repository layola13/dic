cavitation:/ˌkævɪˈteɪʃən/| n. |空化；气蚀；汽蚀 |The formation of vapor cavities in a liquid, typically caused by a rapid drop in pressure.  This phenomenon can cause damage to machinery, especially pumps and turbines.| 例句：The propeller experienced severe cavitation, resulting in reduced efficiency and potential damage.螺旋桨发生严重气蚀，导致效率降低并可能造成损坏。


The high speed of the fluid led to cavitation in the pump.流体的速度过高导致泵内发生空化现象。|近义词：bubble formation, vapor lock |反义词：smooth flow, continuous flow


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Cavitation occurs when pressure drops below the vapor pressure of the liquid. = 当压力降到低于液体的蒸汽压时，就会发生空化现象。
The pump exhibits cavitation under high-flow conditions. = 在高流量条件下，泵会产生空化现象。

一般过去时:
Severe cavitation damaged the impeller last year. = 严重的空化现象去年损坏叶轮。
The experiment showed that cavitation started at 2000 RPM. = 实验表明，空化现象在2000转/分时开始。

现在完成时:
The researchers have observed cavitation in various fluid systems. = 研究人员已经在各种流体系统中观察到空化现象。
Engineers have developed methods to mitigate cavitation in hydraulic systems. = 工程师们已经开发出减轻液压系统中空化现象的方法。

过去完成时:
Before the failure, the pump had experienced significant cavitation. = 在故障发生之前，泵已经经历了明显的空化现象。
The damage to the turbine blades had been caused by prolonged cavitation. = 涡轮叶片的损坏是由长时间的空化现象造成的。

将来时:
Increased flow rates will likely cause cavitation in the new pipeline. = 增加的流量可能会导致新管道发生空化现象。
We will monitor the system closely for signs of cavitation. = 我们将密切监测系统，以防出现空化现象。

虚拟语气:
If the pressure were higher, cavitation would not occur. = 如果压力更高，就不会发生空化现象。
It is vital that cavitation be avoided in this critical component. = 避免在这个关键部件中发生空化现象至关重要。

被动语态:
Cavitation is often caused by high fluid velocities. = 空化现象通常是由高流体速度引起的。
The problem was solved by addressing the cavitation issue. = 通过解决空化问题解决了这个问题。

疑问句:
Is cavitation a significant problem in this application? = 在此应用中，空化现象是否是一个严重的问题？
What are the causes of cavitation in this pump? = 这个泵的空化现象是什么原因造成的？

否定句:
The system design prevents cavitation from occurring. = 系统设计防止空化现象的发生。
No significant cavitation was detected during the tests. = 在测试过程中没有检测到明显的空化现象。
