Etymology:

The word "coterie" comes from the Middle French word "coterie," which itself is derived from the Old French word "cot," meaning "cottage" or "hut."  Originally, it referred to a group of people who met in a small cottage or hut. Over time, the meaning evolved to describe any small, exclusive group.
