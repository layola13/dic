词源:
The word "damper" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "dampen," meaning "to make damp or moist."  This evolved from the Old English word "dæmpnian," sharing a root with "damp." The sense of "to subdue or restrain" developed later, likely from the association of dampness with a slowing or extinguishing effect.
