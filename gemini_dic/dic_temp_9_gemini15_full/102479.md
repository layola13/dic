词源:
Jacksonville is named after Andrew Jackson, the seventh President of the United States.  Its name combines "Jackson" (from Andrew Jackson) and "-ville," a common suffix used to denote a town or city, particularly in the Southern United States.  Therefore, the name literally means "Jackson's town" or "Jackson's city."
