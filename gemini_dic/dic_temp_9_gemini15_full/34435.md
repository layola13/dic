PHRASE->
(No common phrases directly using "claustrophobics" exist.  The term itself functions as a noun describing a group of people.)  Instead, phrases related to claustrophobia are more common:

severe claustrophobia:严重的幽闭恐惧症
suffer from claustrophobia:患有幽闭恐惧症
cope with claustrophobia:应对幽闭恐惧症
treatment for claustrophobia:幽闭恐惧症的治疗
overcome claustrophobia:克服幽闭恐惧症


词源:
The word "claustrophobics" is derived from the noun "claustrophobia," which is a combination of the following:

* **claustrum (Latin):** meaning "a closed place, bar, enclosure"
* **phobia (Greek):** meaning "fear"


Therefore, claustrophobia literally means "fear of enclosed spaces," and "claustrophobics" refers to the people who experience this fear.
