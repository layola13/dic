词源:
The word "grange" comes from the Old French *graunge*, meaning "farm," "granary," or "barn," ultimately derived from the Latin *granea*, meaning "barn."  The association with monastic orders stems from the fact that many large farms were owned and operated by monasteries during the medieval period.
