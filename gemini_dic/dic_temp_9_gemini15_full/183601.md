词源:
The word "requisition" comes from the Old French word "requisition," meaning "request" or "demand."  This ultimately derives from the Latin word "requisiō," which is a combination of "re-" (again) and "quaerere" (to seek).  Therefore, the core meaning reflects a repeated or formal seeking of something.
