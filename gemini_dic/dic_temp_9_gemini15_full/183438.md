reptation:/repˈteɪʃən/| n.|爬行；蠕动；(高分子物理学)链状分子运动|The movement of a polymer chain through a dense medium, analogous to a snake slithering.  This process is crucial for understanding polymer dynamics and properties.|例句：The reptation of the polymer chains is responsible for its viscoelasticity.  聚合物链的爬行运动是其粘弹性的原因。|例句：Scientists studied the reptation model to understand the flow behavior of entangled polymers. 科学家研究了爬行模型以理解纠缠聚合物的流动行为。|近义词：crawling, creeping, wriggling|反义词：None specifically;  antonyms would depend on the context (e.g.,  rapid movement if reptation is slow).|名词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The polymer undergoes reptation. = 聚合物正在进行爬行运动。
Reptation is a key mechanism in polymer physics. = 爬行是高分子物理学中的一个关键机制。


一般过去时:
The scientists observed reptation in the experiment. = 科学家在实验中观察到了爬行运动。
The model explained the observed reptation. = 该模型解释了观察到的爬行运动。


现在完成时:
Researchers have studied reptation for decades. = 研究人员几十年来一直在研究爬行运动。
We have observed significant reptation in this material. = 我们在这个材料中观察到了明显的爬行运动。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the mechanism of polymer flow was unclear.  = 在发现之前，聚合物流动的机制尚不清楚。(implies reptation was not understood)
They had already modeled the reptation process before publishing their findings. = 他们在发表研究结果之前已经对爬行过程进行了建模。


将来时:
Future research will focus on the effects of reptation. = 未来的研究将集中在爬行运动的影响上。
We will analyze the reptation behavior using advanced techniques. = 我们将使用先进的技术来分析爬行行为。


虚拟语气:
If the polymer chains were shorter, the reptation would be faster. = 如果聚合物链更短，爬行速度会更快。
It is important that the reptation process be accurately modeled. = 准确模拟爬行过程非常重要。


被动语态:
Reptation was observed in the experiment. = 在实验中观察到了爬行运动。
The reptation process is being studied extensively. = 爬行过程正在被广泛研究。


疑问句:
Does reptation influence the material's properties? = 爬行运动是否影响材料的性能？
What factors affect the rate of reptation? = 哪些因素影响爬行速度？


否定句:
Reptation does not occur in all polymers. = 并非所有聚合物都会发生爬行运动。
The model did not accurately predict the observed reptation. = 该模型没有准确预测观察到的爬行运动。


PHRASE->
(Since reptation is a scientific term,  phrases are less common in everyday language.  Phrases would generally be used within the context of polymer science.)
reptation model: 爬行模型
tube model of reptation:  管状爬行模型
constrained reptation: 受限爬行
reptation dynamics: 爬行动力学
reptation time: 爬行时间
