词源:
The word "defiler" comes from the verb "defile," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "defouler," meaning "to trample down," "to foul," or "to violate."  The Old French word itself has roots in the Latin word "fōdiō," meaning "to dig," "to pierce," or "to wound."  The sense of moral or physical corruption developed over time.
