用法说明:
Gibbously is an adverb describing something that is shaped like a gibbous moon – that is, more than half-full but not quite full. It describes a rounded, bulging, or swollen shape.  It's not commonly used in everyday conversation but appears more often in descriptive writing, particularly in astronomical or medical contexts.
