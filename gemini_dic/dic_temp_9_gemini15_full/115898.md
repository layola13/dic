用法说明:

Marmorean is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that resembles marble in appearance or quality.  This can refer to:

* **Physical Appearance:**  Smoothness, coldness, paleness, or a generally polished and hard surface.  Think of the look of a polished marble statue or a smooth, pale complexion.

* **Emotional State:**  Coldness, impassivity, or a lack of emotion.  This usage is less common but still found in literature.
