词源:  The word "disentail" is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "to undo" or "reverse") and the word "entail," which itself comes from the Anglo-French "entailer," meaning "to cut off" or "to limit."  The original meaning of "entail" referred to the legal restriction on the inheritance of property, limiting its transferability to specific heirs.  Therefore, "disentail" literally means "to undo the limitation on inheritance."
