rpm:/ˌɑːrpɪˈɛm/|/ˈɑːrpiːˈɛm/| n. |每分钟转数，转速| revolutions per minute; a measure of rotational speed, expressing the number of complete rotations in one minute.  |The engine's rpm is too high.  发动机的转速太高了。|The car's maximum rpm is 7000. 这辆车的最大转速是7000转/分钟。|  speed, rate |slow speed|


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The motor runs at 3000 rpm. = 电机以3000转/分钟的速度运转。
The fan's rpm is currently 1200. = 风扇目前的转速是1200转/分钟。


一般过去时:
The engine's rpm dropped sharply. = 发动机的转速急剧下降。
The centrifuge ran at 5000 rpm yesterday. = 离心机昨天以5000转/分钟的速度运转。


现在完成时:
The machine has reached its maximum rpm. = 机器已达到最大转速。
The turbine has consistently maintained 6000 rpm. = 涡轮机一直保持6000转/分钟的转速。


过去完成时:
The motor's rpm had already decreased before the alarm sounded. = 警报响起之前，电机的转速已经下降了。
The system had run at high rpm for hours before failure. = 系统在故障前以高转速运行了数小时。


将来时:
The generator will operate at 1500 rpm. = 发电机将以1500转/分钟的速度运转。
The drill will reach its maximum rpm in a few seconds. = 电钻几秒钟后将达到最大转速。


虚拟语气:
If the rpm were higher, the output would increase. = 如果转速更高，输出功率就会增加。
I wish the motor's rpm were more stable. = 我希望电机的转速更稳定一些。


被动语态:
The rpm is monitored by a sensor. = 转速由传感器监控。
The speed was adjusted to maintain a constant rpm. = 速度被调整以保持恒定的转速。


疑问句:
What is the engine's rpm? = 发动机的转速是多少？
What rpm is the pump operating at? = 水泵以多少转/分钟的速度运转？


否定句:
The rpm is not high enough. = 转速不够高。
The device did not reach its target rpm. = 设备没有达到目标转速。


PHRASE->
high rpm = 高转速
low rpm = 低转速
idle rpm = 空转转速
maximum rpm = 最大转速
constant rpm = 恒定转速
