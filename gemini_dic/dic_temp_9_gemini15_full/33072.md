chrematistics:/ˌkrɛməˈtɪstɪks/| n. |货币学；致富之道；经济学（早期含义）|The study of wealth acquisition, particularly as it relates to money and finance.  In ancient Greece, it was distinguished from oikonomikos (household management).  The modern understanding of economics encompasses a much broader scope. | Example:  Aristotle distinguished chrematistics from oikonomikos, viewing the former as a merely acquisitive pursuit rather than a productive activity. 亚里士多德将货币学与家政学区分开来，认为前者仅仅是一种获取财富的行为，而不是一种生产性活动。|近义词：economics (in a limited, historical sense), political economy |反义词：oikonomikos (household management, in the Aristotelian sense)
