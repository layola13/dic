词源:

The word "imprecisions" is derived from the word "precision," which comes from the Old French word "precis," meaning "exact" or "definite."  The prefix "im-" is a negative prefix meaning "not" or "lack of," thus creating the antonym "imprecision," meaning "lack of precision" or "inexactness."  The plural form is "imprecisions."

USAGE->  (由于imprecisions是名词，故不适用各种时态)


PHRASE->

degree of imprecision: 不精确的程度
sources of imprecision: 不精确的来源
margin of imprecision: 不精确的范围
avoid imprecision: 避免不精确
