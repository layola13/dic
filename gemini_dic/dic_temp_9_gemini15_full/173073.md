词源:

From *quartermaster* + *-ship*.  *Quartermaster* itself comes from  *quarter* (originally meaning a fourth part, but also referring to a section of a ship or army) and *master* (meaning someone skilled or in charge).  The suffix *-ship* denotes the state, condition, or office of.  Therefore, *quartermastership* literally means "the state or office of being a quartermaster".
