词源:
From Middle English *scrupul, from Old French escrouple, from Late Latin scrupulus, diminutive of Latin scrupus "a sharp stone, a difficulty, a scruple," from scrūpulus (a small, sharp stone), possibly related to  scrūtor "I examine closely".  The sense evolution is from a literal "small stone" to a metaphorical "obstacle" or "hesitation".
