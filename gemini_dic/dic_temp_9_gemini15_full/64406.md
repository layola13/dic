/ˈɜːɡətɪv/| adj.|使役的；施事宾语的| Relating to or denoting a grammatical case of nouns and pronouns that marks the subject of an intransitive verb or the object of a transitive verb whose action affects the subject.  Ergative verbs are those that can take both a subject and an object, where the object is affected by the action of the verb.  The ergative case is often used to express the agent of an action when the verb is intransitive. In some languages, the same grammatical form is used for the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb when the object undergoes the action of the verb.  This is different from the nominative-accusative system, where the subject of both transitive and intransitive verbs takes the nominative case, and the object of a transitive verb takes the accusative case.|The police arrested the thief. (Nominative-accusative: "thief" is accusative.) The window broke. (Ergative: "window" is in the ergative case, undergoing the action).|  active, transitive | intransitive, inactive
