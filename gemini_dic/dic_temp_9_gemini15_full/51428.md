词源:  Derived from the verb "detest," which comes from the Latin word "detestari," meaning "to bear witness against," "to denounce," or "to curse."  The suffix "-ability" indicates the quality or capacity of being something.  Therefore, "detestability" signifies the quality of being worthy of intense dislike or hatred.
