词源:  The word "helmeted" is derived from the noun "helmet" + the suffix "-ed," which indicates the past participle or adjectival form. The word "helmet" itself has a long and complex history, tracing back to Old English *helm, meaning "helmet, protection, covering," and ultimately related to Proto-Germanic *helmiz and Proto-Indo-European *ḱel- meaning "to cover, to hide."  The "-ed" suffix is a common English derivational suffix that forms adjectives from verbs or nouns.
