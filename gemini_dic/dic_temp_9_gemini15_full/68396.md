The word "fallu" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries. It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Perhaps "fall," "fallopian," or a word from another language?  Providing more context about where you encountered this word would be helpful.
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word, a term specific to a certain community or field, or slang not yet widely recognized.
* **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a name or place name.


Without further information, I cannot provide a detailed analysis as requested in the format. Please provide more context so I can assist you.
