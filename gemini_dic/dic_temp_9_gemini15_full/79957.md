词源:  The word is a relatively recent coinage, formed by combining "go-ahead" (meaning to proceed or be allowed to proceed) with the suffix "-ativeness," which indicates a tendency or quality.  "Go-ahead" itself is a colloquialism that emerged in the late 19th century.


用法说明:


go-aheadativeness is primarily used to describe a positive characteristic, emphasizing a person's willingness to take action and pursue opportunities.  It implies more than mere activity; it suggests a confident, decisive approach guided by initiative and often a willingness to take calculated risks.  The word is not commonly used in formal writing, but is more prevalent in informal contexts or when describing personality traits.
