词源:
The word "catastrophize" is a relatively modern coinage, derived from the noun "catastrophe" and the suffix "-ize," which denotes "to make or become."  "Catastrophe" itself comes from the Late Latin word *catastrophus*, which in turn originates from the Greek *καταστροφή* (*katastrophḗ*), meaning "overthrow," "sudden violent change," or "ruin."  The Greek word is composed of *κατά* (*katá*), meaning "down," "against," or "thoroughly," and *στροφή* (*strophḗ*), meaning "turning."
