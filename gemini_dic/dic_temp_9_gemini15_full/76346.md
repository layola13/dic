The word "gadal" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or looking word?
* **It's a word from another language:**  "Gadal" might be a word from another language, possibly a proper noun or a less common term. If you can provide the language of origin, I might be able to help.
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It could be a newly coined word or a slang term not yet widely recognized.

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you would like assistance.
