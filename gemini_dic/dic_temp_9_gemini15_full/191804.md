词源:

The word "scissors" comes from the Old French word "ciseaux," which is the plural form of "ciseau."  "Ciseau" itself is derived from the Vulgar Latin *cisare, meaning "to cut" or "to shear," ultimately from Latin *caedere, "to cut" or "to strike."  The word's journey reflects its evolution from a simple cutting tool to a common household item.
