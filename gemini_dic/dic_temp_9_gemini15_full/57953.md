词源:
The word "drip-feed" is a compound word.  "Drip" refers to the slow, steady falling of liquid, and "feed" means to supply or provide.  The combination creates a vivid image of slowly and gradually providing something, just as liquid drips from a source.  The use of “drip” to describe the slow, measured dispensing of information is a relatively recent development in the English language, arising from the metaphorical use of the image.
