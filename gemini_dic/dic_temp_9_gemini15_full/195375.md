semimetal:/ˈsɛmiˌmɛtəl/ | n. | 半金属 | A semimetal is a chemical element that has properties of both metals and nonmetals.  They are also known as metalloids.  Semimetals typically have intermediate electrical conductivity, which varies with temperature and the presence of impurities.  They are often semiconductors, meaning their conductivity increases with increasing temperature. | Example: Silicon is a semimetal used extensively in electronics.  硅是一种广泛用于电子领域的半金属。|近义词: metalloid | 反义词: metal, nonmetal
