词源:

The word "nobbling" ultimately derives from the word "nob," meaning "head," or, in a figurative sense, a person of importance. The original meaning of "nobbling" involved injuring a horse's legs (hitting it on the head) to prevent it from winning a race. This evolved into the broader sense of making someone or something ineffective.
