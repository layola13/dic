isochronous: /aɪˈsɒkrənəs/ | adj. | 等时的；同时发生的 |  Having or characterized by equal times; equally timed.  Isochronous systems maintain a constant period regardless of amplitude. This term is often used in physics, electronics, and mechanics to describe oscillations or processes that occur at a regular interval.  | 例句：The pendulum's swing is isochronous, meaning each swing takes the same amount of time. 摆的摆动是等时的，这意味着每次摆动所花费的时间相同。


The isochronous operation of the clock ensured accurate timekeeping.  时钟的等时运行确保了精确的计时。 | 近义词：synchronous, simultaneous, uniform | 反义词：asynchronous, uneven, irregular |


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The machine runs isochronously. = 机器等时运行。
This process is isochronous. = 这个过程是等时的。

一般过去时:
The experiment demonstrated isochronous behavior. = 实验演示了等时行为。
The clock ran isochronously for many years. = 这座钟运行多年都保持等时。

现在完成时:
The system has maintained isochronous operation. = 系统一直保持等时运行。
We have observed isochronous oscillations in the data. = 我们在数据中观察到等时振荡。

过去完成时:
The signal had been isochronous before the malfunction. = 故障发生前，信号一直是等时的。
They had ensured the system was isochronous prior to testing. = 他们在测试之前确保了系统是等时的。

将来时:
The new design will be isochronous. = 新的设计将是等时的。
We will maintain isochronous timing throughout the experiment. = 我们将在整个实验过程中保持等时计时。

虚拟语气:
If the system were isochronous, the results would be more accurate. = 如果系统是等时的，结果会更准确。
I wish the oscillations were isochronous. = 我希望振荡是等时的。

被动语态:
The timing was kept isochronous. = 时间保持等时。
Isochronous operation is ensured by the control system. = 控制系统确保了等时运行。

疑问句:
Is the process isochronous? = 这个过程是等时的吗？
Are the oscillations isochronous in this case? = 在这种情况下，振荡是等时的吗？

否定句:
The timing is not isochronous. = 时间不是等时的。
The system did not operate isochronously. = 系统没有等时运行。
