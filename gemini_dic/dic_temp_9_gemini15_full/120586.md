词源:
The word "mirror" comes from the Old French "mirroir," which ultimately derives from the Latin "mirari," meaning "to wonder at" or "to admire."  The original sense was less about reflection and more about the wonder inspired by a polished surface reflecting an image.  Over time, the meaning shifted to focus on the reflective property itself.
