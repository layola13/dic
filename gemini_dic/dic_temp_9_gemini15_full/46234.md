cystolithic:/ˌsɪstoʊˈlɪθɪk/| adj.|含结石的；具细胞石的|Containing or relating to cystoliths (minute concretions of calcium carbonate found in certain plant cells).  The term describes plant tissues or cells that contain cystoliths.|Example: The leaf exhibited cystolithic hairs, characteristic of the genus.  叶片呈现具细胞石的毛状体，这是该属的特征。|近义词：calcareous (in the context of calcium carbonate deposits)|反义词：acystolithic (lacking cystoliths)|形容词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
