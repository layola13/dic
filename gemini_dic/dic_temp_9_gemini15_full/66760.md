exosmosis:/ˌɛksoʊˈsmoʊsɪs/| n. |渗出；外渗|The movement of a solvent through a semipermeable membrane from a region of lower solute concentration to a region of higher solute concentration.|例句：Exosmosis occurred when the cell was placed in a hypertonic solution.  细胞置于高渗溶液中时发生了渗出。|例句：The plant wilted due to exosmosis of water from its cells. 植物由于细胞内水分渗出而枯萎。|近义词：efflux, outward diffusion|反义词：endosmosis


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Exosmosis occurs when the concentration gradient is reversed. = 当浓度梯度反转时会发生渗出。
The plant exhibits exosmosis under drought conditions. = 在干旱条件下，植物表现出渗出。


一般过去时:
Exosmosis occurred rapidly in the experiment. = 实验中渗出迅速发生。
The cells showed significant exosmosis after treatment. = 处理后，细胞显示出明显的渗出。


现在完成时:
Significant exosmosis has occurred in the tissue sample. = 组织样本中发生了明显的渗出。
The researchers have observed exosmosis in several experiments. = 研究人员在几个实验中都观察到了渗出。


过去完成时:
Exosmosis had already begun before the observation was made. = 在进行观察之前，渗出就已经开始了。
The plant had experienced significant exosmosis by the time it wilted. = 到植物枯萎时，它已经经历了大量的渗出。


将来时:
Exosmosis will likely occur if the solution's salinity increases. = 如果溶液的盐度增加，很可能会发生渗出。
We predict that exosmosis will be more pronounced at higher temperatures. = 我们预测在更高的温度下，渗出将更加明显。


虚拟语气:
If the membrane were permeable, exosmosis would be more significant. = 如果膜是可渗透的，渗出将更为显著。
It is unlikely that exosmosis would occur under normal conditions. = 在正常条件下，渗出不太可能发生。


被动语态:
Exosmosis was observed under the microscope. = 渗出在显微镜下被观察到。
The rate of exosmosis was determined using a specialized technique. = 使用专门的技术确定了渗出的速率。


疑问句:
Does exosmosis play a role in plant wilting? = 渗出在植物枯萎中起作用吗？
What factors influence the rate of exosmosis? = 哪些因素会影响渗出的速率？


否定句:
Exosmosis did not occur in the isotonic solution. = 在等渗溶液中没有发生渗出。
The experiment demonstrated that exosmosis was not significant. = 实验表明渗出并不显著。
