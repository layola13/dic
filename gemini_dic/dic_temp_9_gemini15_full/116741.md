词源:
The word "maunder" ultimately derives from the Old French word "maundier," meaning "to beg," or "to complain."  This is related to the Old French word "mande," meaning "basket," suggesting a connection to wandering beggars carrying baskets.  The modern meaning evolved over time, retaining the sense of rambling and aimless movement.
