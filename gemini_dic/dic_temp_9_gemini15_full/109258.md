lemma's:/ˈlɛməz/| n.|引理(复数) |The plural form of "lemma," referring to a subsidiary proposition used as a step in a larger proof.  Lemmas are often used in mathematical proofs and logical arguments to simplify complex demonstrations.  They are self-contained statements that are proven true to facilitate the proof of a larger theorem.|Example: The mathematician presented several lemmas before finally proving the main theorem.  数学家在最终证明主要定理之前提出了几个引理。|近义词: auxiliary proposition, subsidiary theorem|反义词: theorem (in the sense that a lemma supports a theorem, not the other way around)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
These lemmas are crucial to the proof. = 这些引理对证明至关重要。
The lemmas support the central argument. = 这些引理支持核心论点。


一般过去时:
Those lemmas were presented in the previous chapter. = 那些引理在上一章中提出。
The lemmas proved essential to the solution. = 这些引理被证明对解决问题至关重要。


现在完成时:
The researchers have established several key lemmas. = 研究人员已经建立了几个关键引理。
We have used these lemmas extensively in our work. = 我们在我们的工作中广泛使用了这些引理。


过去完成时:
They had already proven those lemmas before starting the main proof. = 在开始主要证明之前，他们已经证明了那些引理。
The author had carefully laid out the necessary lemmas. = 作者已经仔细地阐述了必要的引理。


将来时:
We will present several new lemmas in the next section. = 我们将在下一节中提出几个新的引理。
The proof will rely heavily on the lemmas we have developed. = 证明将严重依赖我们已经开发的引理。


虚拟语气:
If we had more lemmas, the proof would be simpler. = 如果我们有更多引理，证明就会更简单。
I wish we had known these lemmas earlier. = 我希望我们早点知道这些引理。


被动语态:
These lemmas were used to simplify the argument. = 这些引理被用来简化论证。
The lemmas are being applied in various fields of mathematics. = 这些引理正在应用于数学的各个领域。


疑问句:
What lemmas are needed for this proof? = 这个证明需要哪些引理？
Are these lemmas sufficient for the theorem? = 这些引理足以证明定理吗？


否定句:
These lemmas are not sufficient to prove the theorem. = 这些引理不足以证明定理。
The proof did not rely on any new lemmas. = 证明不依赖任何新的引理。



PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "lemma's" (plural of lemma).  The word is primarily used in a technical context within mathematics and logic.  Phrases would typically involve the word "lemma" followed by a descriptive phrase.  For example: "Key lemma of the proof," "Fundamental lemma of calculus," etc.
