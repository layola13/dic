oscilloscopically:/ˌɒsɪləˈskɒpɪkli/ | adv. | 示波器地；用示波器观察地 |  Adverb formed from "oscilloscope," describing a method or process using an oscilloscope. It indicates observation or measurement using an oscilloscope. | The signal was analyzed oscilloscopically to determine its frequency and amplitude.  信号用示波器分析以确定其频率和幅度。|  instrumentally, visually |  (no direct antonym, as it describes a method) | adv.

PHRASE->
(No common phrases exist specifically with "oscilloscopically" due to its technical nature.  Phrases would involve the use of "oscilloscopically" with other words describing the action taken.)


词源:
From "oscilloscope" + "-ically," meaning "in a manner characteristic of."  "Oscilloscope" itself derives from "oscillate" (to move or swing back and forth) + "-scope" (an instrument for viewing).
