non-parametric:/ˌnɒnˌpærəˈmɛtrɪk/ | adj. | 非参数的 | Not based on or involving assumptions about the underlying probability distribution of the data.  Non-parametric methods are often used when the data are not normally distributed or when the sample size is small.  They are generally more robust to outliers and violations of assumptions than parametric methods. |

Example 1: Non-parametric tests are useful when dealing with ordinal data.  非参数检验在处理顺序数据时非常有用。

Example 2:  The Mann-Whitney U test is a common non-parametric alternative to the t-test. 曼-惠特尼U检验是t检验的常用非参数替代方法。
