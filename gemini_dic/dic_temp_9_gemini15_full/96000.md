词源:
The word "incurred" comes from the Old French word "encourir," which itself is derived from the Latin "incurrere," meaning "to run into" or "to meet with."  The prefix "in-" means "into," and "currere" means "to run."  Therefore, the original meaning was to literally run into something, which has evolved to mean to experience or suffer something as a consequence.
