monoglacialism:/ˌmɒnəʊˈɡleɪʃəlɪzəm/|/ˈmɑːnəʊɡleɪʃəlɪzəm/| n. | 单冰川作用 | The theory or condition of a landscape having been shaped by a single glacial advance.  It contrasts with polyglacialism, where multiple glacial advances have shaped the landscape.  The study of monoglacial landscapes helps geologists understand the timing and extent of past glaciations. | Example: The evidence suggests a monoglacial origin for the valley, indicating a single major ice advance.  = 证据表明该山谷起源于单一冰川作用，表明只有一次主要的冰川推进。 The simplistic topography of the area may be explained by monoglacialism. =该地区简单的地形可以用单冰川作用来解释。|近义词: single glaciation | 反义词: polyglacialism | 名词
