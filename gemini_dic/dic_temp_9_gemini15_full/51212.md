词源:  Derived from the adjective "destitute," which comes from the Old French word "destituer," meaning "to deprive," "to remove from office," or "to abandon."  The ultimate origin is the Latin word "destituere,"  composed of "de-" (away, from) and "statuere" (to place, to set).  Thus, "destitute" originally meant "to be deprived of something essential," leading to its modern meaning of lacking the necessities of life.
