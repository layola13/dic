self-energies:/ˈsɛlf ˈɛnərˌdʒiz/| n.|自能，自相互作用能|The self-energies of particles represent the contribution to their energy from their own interactions with themselves, often described using Feynman diagrams in quantum field theory.  This includes interactions with their own field, virtual particle creation and annihilation, and other quantum effects.  Understanding self-energies is crucial for accurate calculations in particle physics and condensed matter physics.|Example: Calculating the self-energy of an electron is a complex task requiring advanced techniques in quantum electrodynamics. 计算电子的自能是一项复杂的任务，需要量子电动力学的先进技术。|近义词：self-interaction energy|反义词：external energy
