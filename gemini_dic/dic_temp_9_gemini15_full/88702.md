词源:  The word "hobbler" derives from the verb "to hobble," which has Old English roots. The Old English word *hopian* meant "to hop" or "to limp".  Over time, "hobble" evolved to describe both the act of limping and the act of restraining an animal's legs.  "Hobbler," therefore, is a relatively straightforward derivative indicating someone who habitually hobbles.
