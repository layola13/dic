cast the first stone: /kæst ðə fɜːrst stəʊn/ | n. phr. | 首先抛石头；率先指责 |  A figurative expression originating from the Bible (John 8:7), referring to the act of being the first to criticize or condemn someone, especially when the critic is equally or more guilty.  It implies hypocrisy, as the first person to cast a stone often shares the same flaws they are condemning in others. | 例句：He was about to criticize her, but then remembered the saying "Let he who is without sin cast the first stone."  他正要批评她，但随后想起了谚语“清者自清”。


例句：  Don't be quick to judge; remember, none of us are perfect, so let he who is without sin cast the first stone. 不要急于评判；记住，我们都不是完美的，所以让无罪者先扔石头吧。
