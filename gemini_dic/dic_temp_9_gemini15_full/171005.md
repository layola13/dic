词源:

The word "pseudoscholastic" is a compound word derived from:

* **pseudo-:**  A prefix of Greek origin meaning "false" or "sham."
* **scholastic:**  An adjective derived from "scholasticism," a system of theology and philosophy dominant in medieval Europe, emphasizing logic and dialectic.  It now more generally refers to relating to schools, scholars, or scholarship.


Therefore, "pseudoscholastic" literally means "falsely scholastic" or "pretending to be scholarly."
