/ˌpriːkɒmprɪˈhensɪvnəsɪz/ | n. | 预先全面性；预先周全性 |  This word is not a standard English word. It's a hyper-concatenation of "pre-", "comprehensiveness", and "-es" (pluralizing suffix). It attempts to describe the state of being comprehensively prepared beforehand, but its artificiality makes it impractical and unusual. There are no established dictionaries or corpora that list this word.  The meaning can be inferred from its components. |  The excessive precomprehensivenesses of the project plan led to delays. (This sentence uses the word for illustrative purposes, but it's not considered proper English usage.) |  thoroughness, preparedness |  incompleteness, unpreparedness | noun
