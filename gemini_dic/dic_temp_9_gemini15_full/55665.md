ditrichotomous: /ˌdaɪtrɪˈkɒtəməs/ | adj. | 二分叉的；二歧的 | Having two branches or divisions.  This term often describes a branching classification system where each category is divided into two mutually exclusive subcategories.  It is primarily used in biology and taxonomy to describe the structure of things like veins in leaves or the branching of phylogenetic trees.  However, it can also be used more generally to describe any system with a two-way division.
