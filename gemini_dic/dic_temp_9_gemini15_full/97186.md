infixing:/ɪnˈfɪksɪŋ/| n. |插入法，中缀法|The process of inserting an affix within the stem of a word.  This is in contrast to prefixing (adding an affix to the beginning) and suffixing (adding an affix to the end). Infixation is relatively rare in English, but common in some other languages, such as Tagalog. |Example:  While rare in English,  a potential example could be constructed hypothetically, such as  "abso-blooming-lutely" where "blooming" is infixed into "absolutely".  Many languages however have much clearer examples. |近义词：insertion, intercalation |反义词：prefixing, suffixing |名词


USAGE->
This section is not applicable to the noun "infixing" as it describes a grammatical process, not a verb that can be conjugated.  The grammatical tenses, moods, and voices are properties of verbs, not nouns.  Infixing itself doesn't have tenses or moods.  It simply describes a linguistic phenomenon.

PHRASE->
This section is also not applicable to the noun "infixing".  Phrases are formed from words, not grammatical processes.  The word "infixing" can be used in phrases, but these phrases would describe the action of infixing itself, rather than having inherent phrasal meaning.  For example:  "The analysis of infixing in Tagalog," or "Examples of infixing in Austronesian languages."
