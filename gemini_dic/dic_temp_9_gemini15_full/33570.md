cili: /ˈsɪliə/ | n. |纤毛，睫毛 |  Cilia are microscopic hair-like structures that line the surface of certain cells. They are found in various parts of the body, such as the respiratory tract and the fallopian tubes, where they play a crucial role in moving fluids and particles.  | 例句：The cilia in the respiratory tract help to remove mucus and debris.  纤毛在呼吸道中帮助清除黏液和碎屑。


The movement of cilia is essential for the proper functioning of several biological processes. | 纤毛的运动对于几个生物过程的正常运作至关重要。 | 近义词：cilia (复数), flagellum (单数鞭毛),  | 反义词：None. |  词性:名词
