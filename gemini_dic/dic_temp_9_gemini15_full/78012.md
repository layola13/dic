词源:
The word "gentlesse" is an older form of "gentleness," ultimately deriving from the Old French word "gentilesse," meaning "nobility," "courtesy," or "good breeding."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "gentilis," meaning "of noble birth," related to the Latin word "gens," meaning "race," "family," or "tribe."  The evolution reflects a shift in meaning, from aristocratic lineage to a quality of character.
