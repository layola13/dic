WORD ORIGIN->

The word "mistrustfulness" is derived from:

* **mistrust:**  This word itself is a combination of the prefix "mis-" (meaning "wrongly" or "badly") and the noun "trust."

* **-fulness:** This suffix is added to nouns to create a noun indicating a state or quality.  It means "full of" or "characterized by."

Therefore, "mistrustfulness" literally means "the state of being full of mistrust" or "the quality of being mistrustful."
