词源:
The word "collaboratively" is derived from the verb "collaborate," which comes from the French word "collaborer," formed from the Latin words "col-" (together) and "laborare" (to work).  Therefore, the core meaning is "to work together."  The adverbial suffix "-ly" is added to create the adverbial form "collaboratively," indicating the manner in which something is done.
