isotonicity:/ˌaɪsoʊtəˈnɪsəti/| n. |等渗性，等张性 |The state of having the same osmotic pressure as another solution.  This means that the solutions have the same concentration of solutes, and therefore, water will not move across a semipermeable membrane separating the two solutions.  Isotonicity is crucial in various fields, particularly medicine and biology. For instance, intravenous fluids need to be isotonic to blood to prevent damage to red blood cells. |Example: The intravenous solution was prepared to ensure isotonicity with the patient's blood.  = 输液溶液的配制是为了确保其与患者血液的等渗性。|近义词：isosmoticity|反义词：hypertonicity, hypotonicity

USAGE->

The researchers had ensured the isotonicity of the solution for the cell culture. = 研究人员已经确保了细胞培养液的等渗性。


将来时:
We will test the isotonicity of the new formulation. = 我们将测试新配方的等渗性。
The technician will maintain isotonicity throughout the procedure. = 技术人员将在整个过程中保持等渗性。


虚拟语气:
If the solution were isotonic, there would be no osmotic pressure difference. = 如果溶液是等渗的，就不会有渗透压差。
It is important that the solution be isotonic to prevent cell damage. = 重要的是溶液必须是等渗的以防止细胞损伤。


被动语态:
Isotonicity is determined by measuring osmotic pressure. = 等渗性是通过测量渗透压来确定的。
The isotonicity of the solution was carefully controlled. = 溶液的等渗性得到了仔细控制。


疑问句:
Is the solution isotonic to the blood? = 该溶液与血液等渗吗？
What is the isotonicity of this solution? = 这个溶液的等渗性是多少？


否定句:
The solution is not isotonic. = 该溶液不是等渗的。
The results did not show isotonicity between the two groups. = 结果没有显示两组之间存在等渗性。


PHRASE->
isotonicity test = 等渗性测试
maintain isotonicity = 维持等渗性
adjust isotonicity = 调整等渗性
isotonicity solution = 等渗溶液
