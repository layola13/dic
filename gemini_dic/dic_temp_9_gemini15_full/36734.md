colloidality:/ˌkɔɪˈdɑːləti/| n. |胶体性，胶态|The state or quality of being a colloid; the properties of a colloidal system.  Colloidality refers to the characteristics of a substance that exists as a colloid, a mixture where one substance is dispersed evenly throughout another.  This dispersion involves particles that are larger than those in a solution but smaller than those in a suspension.  These properties include things like particle size, surface area, and interactions between the dispersed phase and the continuous phase.|Example: The high colloidality of the clay suspension made it difficult to filter.  胶粘土悬浮液的高胶体性使其难以过滤。|近义词：colloidal nature, colloidal state |反义词：solution-like properties (for true solutions), suspension-like properties (for coarse suspensions)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The colloidality of this mixture is high. = 这种混合物的胶体性很高。
This material exhibits high colloidality. = 此材料表现出高胶体性。

一般过去时:
The colloidality of the sample was measured. = 样品的胶体性被测量了。
The experiment demonstrated the colloidality's impact. = 实验证明了胶体性的影响。

现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the colloidality of various materials. = 科学家们已经研究了各种材料的胶体性。
Researchers have determined the colloidality of this substance. = 研究人员已经确定了这种物质的胶体性。

过去完成时:
They had already understood the colloidality before the experiment. = 他们在实验之前就已经了解了胶体性。
The effect of colloidality had been previously investigated. = 胶体性的影响以前已被研究过。

将来时:
We will analyze the colloidality of the new sample. = 我们将分析新样品的胶体性。
They will determine the colloidality using a new method. = 他们将使用一种新方法来确定胶体性。

虚拟语气:
If the colloidality were higher, the results would differ. = 如果胶体性更高，结果将有所不同。
I wish I had known the colloidality beforehand. = 我希望我事先知道胶体性。

被动语态:
The colloidality is determined by particle size distribution. = 胶体性由粒度分布决定。
The colloidality was affected by the temperature change. = 胶体性受温度变化的影响。

疑问句:
What is the colloidality of this solution? = 这种溶液的胶体性是多少？
How does temperature affect the colloidality? = 温度如何影响胶体性？

否定句:
The colloidality was not significant in this case. = 在这种情况下，胶体性并不显著。
The mixture did not show high colloidality. = 该混合物没有显示出高胶体性。


PHRASE->
high colloidality 高胶体性
low colloidality 低胶体性
control colloidality 控制胶体性
measure colloidality 测量胶体性
impact of colloidality 胶体性的影响

WORD ORIGIN->
The word "colloidality" is derived from the word "colloid," which comes from the Greek word "κόλλα" (kólla), meaning "glue."  The suffix "-ality" denotes a state or quality.  Therefore, "colloidality" signifies the state or quality of being a colloid.
