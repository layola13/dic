词源：The word "lobsided" is a combination of "lob" (meaning to throw or hit something in a casual or clumsy way) and "sided" (referring to a side).  The original meaning suggested something that was unevenly weighted or thrown, leading to its current meaning of being unbalanced.  The exact etymology is uncertain, but it likely evolved through informal usage.
