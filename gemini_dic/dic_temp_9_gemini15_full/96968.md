词源:
The word "infant" comes from the Old French word "enfant," meaning "child."  This in turn derives from the Latin word "infans,"  which literally means "unable to speak."  The "in-" prefix indicates negation, and "-fans" is related to the verb "fari," meaning "to speak." Thus, an "infant" was originally understood as a child too young to speak.
