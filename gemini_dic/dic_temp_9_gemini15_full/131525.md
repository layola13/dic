The word "noncomicality" is a relatively rare word, formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the noun "comicality" (meaning the quality of being comical or humorous).  Therefore, understanding the etymology and usage of "comicality" is key to understanding "noncomicality".


"Comicality" derives from "comical," which itself comes from "comedy."  "Comedy" originates from the Ancient Greek word "kōmōidia," referring to a type of dramatic performance characterized by humor and lightheartedness.  The suffix "-ity" transforms the adjective "comical" into a noun, signifying its quality or state.
