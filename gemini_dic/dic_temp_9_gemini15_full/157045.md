pilus:/ˈpaɪləs/| n.|菌毛，纤毛|A pilus (plural pili) is a hair-like appendage found on the surface of many bacteria and archaea.  It's significantly thinner and shorter than a flagellum and plays a crucial role in various biological processes, primarily adhesion and genetic exchange.|例句：The bacteria used pili to attach themselves to the host cell.  细菌利用菌毛附着在宿主细胞上。|近义词：fimbria (often used interchangeably, but with subtle distinctions)|反义词：None|名词

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The bacteria possess many pili. = 细菌拥有许多菌毛。
The pili adhere to the surface. = 菌毛粘附在表面。


一般过去时:
The pili facilitated bacterial conjugation. = 菌毛促进了细菌接合。
The researchers observed the pili under a microscope. = 研究人员在显微镜下观察了菌毛。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the role of pili in biofilm formation. = 科学家们已经研究了菌毛在生物膜形成中的作用。
The bacteria have attached using their pili. = 细菌已经利用它们的菌毛附着。


过去完成时:
The pili had already retracted before the observation. = 在观察之前，菌毛已经收缩了。
The conjugation had occurred via pili. = 接合是通过菌毛发生的。


将来时:
Researchers will investigate the pili's role in pathogenesis. = 研究人员将研究菌毛在发病机制中的作用。
We will analyze the pili's structure using advanced microscopy. = 我们将使用先进的显微镜技术分析菌毛的结构。


虚拟语气:
If the bacteria lacked pili, they would be less infectious. = 如果细菌缺乏菌毛，它们感染性就会降低。
It is hypothesized that if pili were absent, adhesion would be impaired. = 假设如果菌毛不存在，粘附就会受损。


被动语态:
The pili were observed using electron microscopy. = 菌毛是用电子显微镜观察到的。
The genetic material was transferred via pili. = 遗传物质是通过菌毛转移的。


疑问句:
What is the function of these pili? = 这些菌毛的功能是什么？
How many pili does this bacterium have? = 这细菌有多少菌毛？


否定句:
The bacteria did not have pili. = 细菌没有菌毛。
The pili were not visible under the light microscope. = 在光学显微镜下看不到菌毛。



PHRASE->
pili type IV = IV型菌毛
sex pili = 性菌毛
fimbriae (often used interchangeably with pili)= 纤毛（常与菌毛互换使用）
bacterial pili = 细菌菌毛
pili-mediated adhesion = 菌毛介导的粘附
