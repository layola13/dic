词源:
The term "glad-handing" combines "glad" (meaning happy or pleased) and "hand" (referring to shaking hands). The combination suggests a superficially enthusiastic and friendly greeting, often used insincerely.  The term evolved from the practice of politicians and other influential figures using excessive handshaking to appear friendly and approachable, often as a way to win over voters or clients.
