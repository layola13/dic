词源:

The word is a combination of:

* **hyper-**:  A prefix meaning "excessive," "over," or "beyond."  Derived from Greek ὑπέρ (hupér), meaning "over," "above," or "beyond."
* **modestly**: An adverb meaning "in a modest manner." Derived from the adjective "modest," ultimately from Latin *modestus* ("moderate," "temperate").  *-ly* is an adverbial suffix.


Therefore, "hypermodestly" literally means "excessively modestly."  The seeming contradiction highlights the ironic nature of the excessive humility expressed.
