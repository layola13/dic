词源:
The word "coot" ultimately derives from the Old English word "cotes,"  referring to a type of diving bird.  The modern spelling and pronunciation evolved over time.  The connection to the meaning "stupid person" is a later development, likely due to the bird's somewhat ungainly appearance and behaviour.
