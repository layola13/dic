cyclone-collector: /ˈsaɪˌkloʊn ˈkəˌlɛktər/ | n. |旋风分离器，旋风收集器 | A cyclone collector is a piece of equipment that uses centrifugal force to separate particles from a gas stream.  The gas stream is spun rapidly, causing heavier particles to be thrown to the outside of the container and collected, while the cleaner gas exits at the top. |  The factory uses a cyclone collector to remove dust from its exhaust gases. = 工厂使用旋风分离器去除废气中的灰尘。 The cyclone collector effectively separated the sawdust from the air. = 旋风分离器有效地将锯末与空气分离。 | dust collector, centrifugal separator |  (no direct antonym, but opposite function would be a particle emitter) | 名词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The cyclone collector removes dust particles. = 旋风分离器去除尘埃颗粒。
This factory uses a large cyclone collector. = 这个工厂使用一个大型旋风分离器。

一般过去时:
