词源:

The word "handmaid" is a compound word.  It combines "hand" (meaning "at hand,"  "close by," or "in service of") and "maid" (meaning "a female servant").  Therefore, a handmaid is literally a "maid at hand," emphasizing her close proximity and service to her employer.  The word reflects the historical reality of domestic service, particularly in upper-class households.
