WORD ORIGIN->
The word "indented" comes from the past participle of the verb "indent," which itself derives from the Middle French word "endenter," meaning "to tooth, notch."  This ultimately traces back to the Old French word "dent," meaning "tooth." The image is of creating a notch or tooth-like shape, mirroring the visual effect of indentation.
