/ˈrɛtrəˌnɪm/ | n. |逆向构词法，追溯命名词 | A retronym is a new name given to something that already existed but now needs a new name to distinguish it from a newer, related thing.  It's essentially a word created to clarify a distinction that wasn't necessary before a new technology or concept emerged.  For example, before the advent of digital photography, "camera" simply meant a camera;  it didn't need further specification.  Now, we use "film camera" as a retronym to differentiate it from a "digital camera."| Example:  "Analog watch" is a retronym; before digital watches became common, "watch" simply referred to a time-telling device. | 近义词:  back-formation, neologism (in some contexts) | 反义词:  N/A
