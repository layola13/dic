conformation:/ˌkɒnfəˈmeɪʃən/ /ˌkɑːnfərˈmeɪʃən/| n. |构象，构造，确认 |The spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule.  It refers to the three-dimensional structure of a molecule, particularly in relation to the rotation around single bonds. Different conformations can have different energies and properties. |例句：The protein's conformation changed upon binding to the ligand. 蛋白质与配体结合后构象发生了变化。|例句：The police asked for confirmation of his identity. 警方要求确认他的身份。|近义词：shape, structure, configuration, arrangement, verification |反义词：N/A

将来时:
They will confirm the results next week. = 他们下周将确认结果。
We will study different conformations of this polymer. = 我们将研究这种聚合物的不同构象。


虚拟语气:
If the conformation were different, the reaction would not proceed. = 如果构象不同，反应就不会进行。
If he had confirmed the details earlier, we would have had more time. = 如果他早点确认细节，我们就会有更多的时间。


被动语态:
The conformation was determined by X-ray crystallography. = 构象是由 X 射线晶体学确定的。
The booking was confirmed by email. = 预约已通过电子邮件确认。


疑问句:
What is the conformation of the molecule? = 分子的构象是什么？
