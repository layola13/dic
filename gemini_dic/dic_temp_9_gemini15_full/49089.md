deictics:/daɪkˈtɪks/| n. |指示词；指示语|Words or expressions that rely on the context of their use (especially the time and place) to convey meaning. They point to something, rather than directly naming it.  Deictics include pronouns (I, you, he, she, it, we, they), demonstratives (this, that, these, those), adverbs of place (here, there), adverbs of time (now, then), and verbs of motion (come, go).|例句：The word "here" is a deictic because its meaning depends on the location of the speaker.  "I" is a deictic pronoun as it refers to the speaker.|近义词：indexical, demonstrative|反义词：None (the antonym is more of a concept of "non-deictic" which would be words with fixed meaning regardless of context)|名词
