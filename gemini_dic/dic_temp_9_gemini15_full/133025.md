The word "nonentreating" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need a correctly spelled or intended word.  If you can provide the intended word or more context, I can offer a detailed analysis.
