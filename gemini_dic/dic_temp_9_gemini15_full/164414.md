/priːɪnˈkʌrɪdʒmənts/ | n. | 预先鼓励；提前的鼓励 |  The word "preencouragements" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a newly coined word, formed by adding the prefix "pre-" to "encouragements."  While understandable in context, it lacks established dictionary definition and usage.  Its meaning is derived from the individual components: "pre-" suggesting something done beforehand, and "encouragements" referring to acts of support or inspiration.  Therefore, it implies acts of encouragement given before an event or action.  Because it's not a standard word, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage in the requested format is not feasible.  It would be best to use clearer, established vocabulary like "advance encouragement," "prior encouragement," or "early support." |  Example sentence (using a more standard phrasing):  The team received *advance encouragement* from their coach before the crucial game. = 球队在关键比赛前得到了教练的提前鼓励。 | 近义词: advance encouragement, prior encouragement, early support, preliminary support | 反义词: discouragement, disincentives |  名词
