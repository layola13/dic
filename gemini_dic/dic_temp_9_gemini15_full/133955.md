/ˌnɒnˈheɪnəsnəsɪz/ | n. |非恶劣行为；非 heinous 行为 |The word "nonheinousnesses" is a rare and somewhat contrived word, formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the plural noun "heinousnesses" (itself derived from the adjective "heinous"). It describes actions or occurrences that are not heinous, that is, not extremely wicked or shockingly evil. The word is not commonly used in everyday conversation or writing.  | Example: The court considered the defendant's actions to be nonheinousnesses, therefore resulting in a lighter sentence.  法院认为被告的行为并非恶劣行为，因此判处较轻的刑罚。|近义词:benign acts, harmless deeds, non-malicious actions |反义词:heinous acts, atrocities, enormities |名词
