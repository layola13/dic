词源:
respectability derives from the adjective "respectable," which in turn comes from the verb "respect," ultimately from the Latin "respectus," meaning "regard," "attention," or "consideration."  The suffix "-ability" indicates the capacity or potential for something.  Therefore, respectability signifies the capacity or quality of being worthy of respect.
