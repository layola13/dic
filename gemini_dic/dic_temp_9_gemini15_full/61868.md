词源:
The word "empoverish" comes from the Old French word "empovrir," which is a combination of the prefix "em-" (meaning "in," "into," or "on") and "povrer" (meaning "to make poor").  "Povrer" itself originates from the Old French word "pover," meaning "poor."  The ultimate root lies in the Latin word "pauper," meaning "poor person."
