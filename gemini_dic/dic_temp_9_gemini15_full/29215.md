词源:
The word "casket" ultimately derives from the Old French word "casquet," meaning "small box" or "case."  This, in turn, is a diminutive of "casc," which is related to the Latin word "capsa," meaning "box" or "case."  The evolution reflects a shift from a general term for a box to a more specific one associated with valuables or, later, the deceased.
