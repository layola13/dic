USAGE->
This word is not a standard English word.  It's a neologism, a newly coined word, formed by combining "pre-", "suspicious," and "-nesses."  Therefore, standard grammatical usages don't apply directly.  One could attempt to construct examples based on how the word *might* be used, but it would be highly unconventional.

For example,  one might try to force a fit with existing grammatical structures, but the resulting sentences would sound unnatural and awkward.

Attempting to provide examples for tenses, voices, etc. would be artificially forcing grammar onto a non-standard word.

PHRASE->
Because "presuspiciousnesses" is not a standard word, there are no established phrases using it.
