prim's:/prɪmz/| n.|普里姆算法|Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph.  This means it finds a subset of the edges that connects all the vertices in the graph without any cycles, and the total weight of the edges in the subset is minimized.|例句：We used Prim's algorithm to find the most efficient network configuration.|近义词：Kruskal's algorithm|反义词：无


USAGE->
Prim's algorithm is not a word that is conjugated like verbs or adjectives. It is a proper noun referring to a specific algorithm. Therefore, tense, voice and negation do not apply.  It is used as a noun in sentences.
