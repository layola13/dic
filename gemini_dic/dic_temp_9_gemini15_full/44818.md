crushability: /ˌkrʌʃəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可碎性，易碎性 | The ability of a material to be crushed or broken into smaller pieces.  It often refers to the ease with which a material can be crushed under pressure.  | Example: The crushability of the ore was tested before processing.  矿石的可碎性在加工前进行了测试。 The high crushability of this material makes it easy to recycle.  这种材料的高可碎性使其易于回收。| 近义词：friability, fragility, breakability | 反义词：indestructibility, incompressibility
