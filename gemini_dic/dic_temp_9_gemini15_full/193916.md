* **self-**:  from Old English *self, *sylf, meaning "self, same."
* **efface**: from Old French *effacer, from Latin *ex- ("out, from") + *facere ("to make, do").  Literally meaning "to rub out, erase."

Therefore, "self-effacing" literally means "to erase oneself," or to make oneself inconspicuous.
