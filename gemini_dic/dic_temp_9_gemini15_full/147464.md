The word is formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" (pluralizing suffix for abstract nouns) to "overofficious."

* **over-**:  prefix indicating "excessive" or "too much"
* **officious**: adjective meaning "excessively eager to help or offer unwanted advice."  It comes from the Latin "officium" meaning "duty" or "service."  The evolution added the sense of intrusive helpfulness.
