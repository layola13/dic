raylet:/ˈreɪlɛt/| n.|射线单元，光线单元|A raylet is a fundamental unit of light or radiation, often used in the context of computer graphics and ray tracing. It represents a single ray of light propagating through a scene.|Example: The raylet tracing algorithm efficiently simulates the path of light.|近义词：ray, beam|反义词:None.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The raylet interacts with the surface. = 射线单元与表面相互作用。
Each raylet contributes to the final image. = 每个射线单元都对最终图像有贡献。

一般过去时:
The raylet intersected the object. = 射线单元与物体相交。
The raylet was reflected by the mirror. = 射线单元被镜子反射。

现在完成时:
The raylet has reached the light source. = 射线单元已到达光源。
Many raylets have been processed. = 许多射线单元已被处理。

过去完成时:
The raylet had already passed the lens. = 射线单元已经穿过透镜。
Before the calculation, the raylet had been defined. = 在计算之前，射线单元已被定义。

将来时:
The raylet will hit the wall. = 射线单元将撞击墙壁。
The raylet will be refracted by the prism. = 射线单元将被棱镜折射。

虚拟语气:
If the raylet were to hit a transparent object, it would refract. = 如果射线单元撞击透明物体，它将被折射。
I wish the raylet had reached the target faster. = 我希望射线单元能更快地到达目标。

被动语态:
The raylet was traced through the scene. = 射线单元被追踪穿过场景。
The raylet's properties were calculated. = 射线单元的属性被计算。

疑问句:
Where did the raylet originate? = 射线单元起源于何处？
How many raylets are needed for this image? = 这张图像需要多少个射线单元？

否定句:
The raylet did not hit any object. = 射线单元没有击中任何物体。
The raylet was not reflected. = 射线单元没有被反射。


PHRASE->
raylet tracing = 射线单元追踪
raylet generation = 射线单元生成
raylet intersection = 射线单元相交
raylet shading = 射线单元着色
raylet depth = 射线单元深度
