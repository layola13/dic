词源:  The word "kissingcrust" is a relatively recent culinary term.  "Kissing" refers to the slightly browned and colored appearance of the crust, suggesting a gentle kiss from the oven's heat. "Crust" refers to the outer layer of baked pastry.  There isn't a long etymological history like some older words; it's a descriptive compound word.
