inductance:/ɪnˈdʌktəns/| n. |电感；自感；感应|The property of an electrical circuit by which a change in current in the circuit induces a voltage in the circuit and in any nearby circuits.  It is measured in henries (H).|例句：The inductance of the coil is 10 henries.  这个线圈的电感是10亨利。

例句：High inductance can cause problems in high-frequency circuits. 高电感会在高频电路中引起问题。|近义词：self-inductance, mutual inductance|反义词：无|词性：名词

parasitic inductance: 寄生电感

词源:
The word "inductance" is derived from the verb "induce," meaning "to cause (something) to happen or be created."  The suffix "-ance" forms nouns of state or action.  The concept of inductance relates to the induced electromotive force (EMF) in a circuit due to a changing magnetic field.  Therefore, the name reflects the process of inducing voltage.
