词源:

The word "hyperprophetic" is a compound word formed from:

* **hyper-:**  A prefix meaning "excessive," "beyond," or "above."  Derived from Greek ὑπέρ (hupér), meaning "over," "above," or "beyond."

* **prophetic:**  An adjective meaning "relating to or characteristic of a prophet; having or showing the ability to predict the future." Derived from "prophet," ultimately from Greek προφήτης (prophētēs), meaning "prophet," "speaker," "interpreter."


Therefore, "hyperprophetic" literally means "excessively prophetic" or "beyond prophetic."
