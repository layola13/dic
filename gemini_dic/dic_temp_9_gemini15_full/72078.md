floatability: /ˌfloʊtəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 浮力，漂浮性 | The ability of an object to float in a liquid or gas.  This property is determined by the object's density relative to the density of the fluid.  | Example: The floatability of the log allowed it to drift down the river. = 木头的浮力使它能够顺流而下。 The floatability of the cork is excellent. = 软木塞的浮力极佳。| 近义词：buoyancy | 反义词：sinkability


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The wood possesses good floatability. = 这木头具有良好的浮力。
This material shows high floatability in water. =这种材料在水中显示出高浮力。


一般过去时:
The boat's floatability was compromised by the leak. = 船只因漏水而浮力受损。
The log's floatability decreased as it absorbed water. = 木头吸收水分后浮力下降。


现在完成时:
Scientists have improved the floatability of the life vest. = 科学家们已经改进了救生衣的浮力。
Researchers have studied the floatability of various materials. = 研究人员研究了各种材料的浮力。


过去完成时:
The ship had lost its floatability before it sank. = 这艘船沉没之前就已经失去了浮力。
The raft had already compromised its floatability due to the storm. = 由于暴风雨，木筏的浮力已经受损。


将来时:
The engineers will enhance the floatability of the new design. = 工程师们将增强新设计的浮力。
We will test the floatability of the prototype tomorrow. = 我们明天将测试样品的浮力。


虚拟语气:
If the floatability were greater, the object would float. = 如果浮力更大，物体就会漂浮。
I wish the floatability of this boat were better. = 我希望这艘船的浮力更好。


被动语态:
The floatability of the submarine is carefully monitored. = 潜艇的浮力受到仔细监控。
The floatability of the object was determined by experiment. = 物体的浮力是通过实验确定的。


疑问句:
What factors affect the floatability of an object? = 哪些因素会影响物体的浮力？
How can we improve the floatability of this design? = 我们如何改进这个设计物的浮力？


否定句:
The damaged boat lacked floatability. = 受损的船只缺乏浮力。
The rock did not possess sufficient floatability to stay afloat. = 这块石头没有足够的浮力保持漂浮。


PHRASE->
positive floatability = 正浮力
negative floatability = 负浮力
neutral floatability = 中性浮力
test floatability = 测试浮力
improve floatability = 提高浮力
