近义词：absorbing, captivating, fascinating, riveting, enthralling

反义词：boring, dull, tedious, uninteresting

词源:  From "engross," meaning to absorb completely, which in turn comes from Old French "engrosser," meaning "to write in large letters" (referring to the formal writing of legal documents), ultimately from Latin "grossus," meaning "thick, large."  The shift in meaning reflects how something that completely occupies one's attention, like a large, important document, can be described as "engrossing."
