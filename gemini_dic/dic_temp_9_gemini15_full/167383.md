The word "pretyranny" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word, or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need to consider possibilities:


**Possibility 1: Misspelling**

If it's a misspelling, it could be one of the following:

* **Tyranny:** /ˈtɪrəni/ | n. |暴政，专制统治 |Unjust or cruel exercise of power; oppressive government. | Example: The people suffered under the tyranny of the dictator.  人民在独裁者的暴政下受苦。| Near Synonyms: oppression, despotism, autocracy | Antonyms: democracy, freedom, liberty | Noun


**Possibility 2:  A newly coined word (blend)**

It might be a blend of "pretty" and "tyranny," implying a relatively mild or aesthetically pleasing form of oppression.  However, without context, its meaning is unclear and its usage would be highly informal and unconventional.  There is no established meaning or grammatical properties for such a word.

**If you can provide context where you encountered this word,** I can offer a more accurate analysis.  For example, knowing the sentence it appears in would be very helpful in determining its intended meaning.
