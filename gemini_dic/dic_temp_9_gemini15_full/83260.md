/dʒɪmnəˈdʒɛn/| n. |生殖细胞发生素|A hypothetical substance once thought to stimulate the development of germ cells (sex cells).  The existence of gymnogen is now considered doubtful. This term is largely obsolete in modern biological literature.|The research on gymnogen was eventually abandoned due to lack of supporting evidence.|近义词：germ cell growth factor (though this is a more modern and accurate term)|反义词：N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The scientist studies the effects of gymnogen. = 科学家研究生殖细胞发生素的影响。

一般过去时:
Researchers investigated the properties of gymnogen. = 研究人员调查了生殖细胞发生素的特性。
Scientists hypothesized that gymnogen stimulated cell growth. = 科学家假设生殖细胞发生素刺激细胞生长。


现在完成时:
No conclusive evidence has emerged supporting the existence of gymnogen. = 没有出现支持生殖细胞发生素存在的结论性证据。
Scientists have questioned the validity of earlier findings on gymnogen. = 科学家对早期关于生殖细胞发生素的研究结果的有效性提出了质疑。


过去完成时:

If gymnogen existed, it would revolutionize reproductive medicine. = 如果生殖细胞发生素存在，它将彻底改变生殖医学。(Note: This is hypothetical, given the current understanding)
I wish we had a better understanding of germ cell development. = 我希望我们对生殖细胞发育有更好的了解。(Note: This example replaces gymnogen with a more accurate concept)


被动语态:
The effects of gymnogen were once believed to be significant. = 生殖细胞发生素的影响曾经被认为是显著的。
The existence of gymnogen was questioned by many scientists. = 生殖细胞发生素的存在被许多科学家质疑。


疑问句:
Did gymnogen truly exist? = 生殖细胞发生素真的存在吗？
What were the supposed functions of gymnogen? = 生殖细胞发生素的假定功能是什么？


否定句:
Gymnogen was not a definitively proven substance. = 生殖细胞发生素并非一种得到明确证实的物质。
The research did not provide sufficient evidence for the existence of gymnogen. = 这项研究没有提供足够的证据来证明生殖细胞发生素的存在。
