This request is impossible to fulfill.  "Making-on" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in any major dictionary. It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word or phrase?  Please double-check the spelling.
* **It's a newly coined word or slang:** If it's a very recent invention, it won't be in dictionaries yet.  More context is needed to understand its meaning.
* **It's a regional dialect word:**  The word might be used in a specific geographic location.  Again, context is essential.
* **It's part of a larger phrase:** The word might only make sense within a particular phrase.

To help me assist you, please provide:

* **The sentence or context** in which you encountered "making-on."
* **The source** where you found this word (book, article, conversation, etc.).

With more information, I might be able to help you understand the intended meaning.
