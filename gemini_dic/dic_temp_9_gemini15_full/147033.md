The word "overlauding" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  However, we can speculate on its possible meaning and construction:

It seems to be formed by combining "over-" (meaning excessive or too much) and "lauding" (meaning praising highly).  Thus, a plausible meaning would be "excessive praise" or "praising too much."

Let's assume, for illustrative purposes, that "overlauding" *were* a word.  Then a possible analysis would look like this:

/ˌoʊvərˈlɔːdɪŋ/ | /ˌəʊvəˈlɔːdɪŋ/ | n. |过度赞扬；过分称赞 | Excessive praise; praising something or someone too much.  It implies that the praise is undeserved or excessive to the point of being insincere or even irritating. | The overlauding of the new product felt disingenuous; its flaws were obvious. = 对新产品的过度赞扬感觉不真诚；它的缺陷显而易见。  The constant overlauding of his work was making him uncomfortable. =  对他作品的不断过度赞扬让他感到不舒服。 |  exaggerated praise, hyperbole, flattery | criticism, condemnation, denouncement | noun
