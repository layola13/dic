词源:The word "screwball" emerged in the early 20th century.  Its origin likely combines "screw," implying something twisted or abnormal, with "ball," perhaps suggesting a lively, energetic, or unpredictable nature.  Its association with baseball, where a screwball is a type of curveball, further supports this idea of something unpredictable and unconventional. The term gained particular prominence during the 1930s, referring to the comedic genre of "screwball comedies" characterized by fast-paced plots, witty dialogue, and eccentric characters.
