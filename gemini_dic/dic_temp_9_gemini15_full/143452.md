The word "outfoxes" is derived from the verb "outfox," which combines the prefix "out-" (meaning "to surpass" or "to exceed") with the noun "fox," referring to a clever and cunning animal.  The "-es" ending indicates the third-person singular present tense.  The use of "fox" to represent cunning and cleverness is rooted in folklore and the animal's reputation for intelligence and trickery.
