词源:
The word "deserting" comes from the Old French word "deserter," meaning "to forsake," "to abandon," or "to leave."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "desertus," the past participle of "deserere," meaning "to abandon," "to leave," or "to forsake."  The meaning has evolved over time, retaining the core sense of abandoning a commitment or responsibility.
