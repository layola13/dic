diffractogram:/dɪˈfræktəˌɡræm/ | n. |衍射图, 衍射谱 | A diffractogram is a graphical representation of the results of a diffraction experiment, typically showing the intensity of diffracted radiation as a function of the scattering angle or other relevant parameter.  It's used to identify crystalline materials based on their unique diffraction patterns. | Example: The X-ray diffractogram revealed the presence of quartz in the sample. X射线衍射图显示样品中存在石英。 | 近义词：diffraction pattern | 反义词：无


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't conjugate like verbs.  Therefore, typical verb tenses are not applicable.  The usage focuses on its role in a sentence.

Example 1 (Simple sentence): The diffractogram showed sharp peaks, indicating a highly crystalline structure. 衍射图显示出尖锐的峰值，表明具有高度结晶的结构。

Example 2 (Complex sentence):  Analysis of the powder diffractogram, obtained using Cu Kα radiation, allowed for the identification of the unknown mineral. 使用Cu Kα辐射获得的粉末衍射图的分析，使得能够鉴定未知矿物。
