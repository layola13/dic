词源:
The word "epidural" comes from the Greek words "epi," meaning "upon" or "over," and "dūra," meaning "hard mother" (referring to the dura mater, the tough outer membrane covering the brain and spinal cord).  Therefore, "epidural" literally means "upon the dura mater," indicating the location of the injection.
