WORD ORIGIN->
The word "inroad" originally meant a raid or incursion, and it came from the Old English words "in" and "rād," meaning "road."  Over time, the meaning shifted to include the idea of an advance or penetration into something.  The modern usage reflects both the original sense of invasion and the more general sense of progress.
