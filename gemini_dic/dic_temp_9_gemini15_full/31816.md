checksum:/ˈtʃɛksʌm/ | n. | 校验和 | A checksum is a small-size data derived from a block of digital data for the purpose of detecting errors that may have been introduced during its transmission or storage.  It's a form of redundancy check. The checksum is generated by an algorithm that operates on the data block and produces a fixed-size result, often a single number or a short string.  If the checksum of the received data doesn't match the original checksum, it indicates that an error occurred. | Example: The file transfer included a checksum to verify data integrity. 文件传输包含校验和以验证数据完整性。 |近义词: hash, CRC, cyclic redundancy check | 反义词: None


USAGE->
(Checksum is a noun, so it doesn't have verb conjugations like the example word "what".  The following shows how checksum is used in sentences with different sentence structures)

Declarative Sentence:
The checksum verification failed. = 校验和验证失败。
The calculated checksum matched the expected value. = 计算出的校验和与预期值匹配。


Interrogative Sentence:
What is the checksum of this file? = 这个文件的校验和是多少？
Did the checksum check pass? = 校验和检查通过了吗？


Exclamatory Sentence:
The checksum error is critical! = 校验和错误很严重！
The checksum matched!  = 校验和匹配！


Negative Sentence:
The checksum didn't match. = 校验和不匹配。
There was no checksum provided. = 没有提供校验和。


PHRASE->
checksum verification = 校验和验证
error detection checksum = 差错检测校验和
data integrity checksum = 数据完整性校验和
calculate checksum = 计算校验和
checksum algorithm = 校验和算法
