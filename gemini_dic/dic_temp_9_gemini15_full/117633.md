词源:

The word "megasthenic" is derived from Greek:

* **mega- (μέγα):** meaning "great," "large," or "powerful"
* **sthenic (σθένος):** meaning "strength"

Therefore, megasthenic literally translates to "possessing great strength."  The term carries a connotation of exceptional or even excessive strength, often associated with well-developed musculature.
