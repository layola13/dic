词源:
The word "digestives" comes from the verb "digest," ultimately derived from the Latin verb "digerere," meaning "to carry apart," "to distribute," or "to dissolve."  The suffix "-ive" forms adjectives and nouns denoting a tendency or function.  Therefore, "digestives" refers to something that aids in the process of digestion.
