词源:
The word "force-out" is a compound word formed by combining "force" (meaning to compel or oblige) and "out" (meaning away from a place or position).  Its meaning is a direct combination of these two elements, resulting in the meaning of compelling someone to leave.  The etymology of "force" traces back to Old French *fors and ultimately to Latin *fortis (strong). "Out" has Old English origins.
