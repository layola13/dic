metafictions:/ˌmɛtəˈfɪkʃənz/| n. |元小说；后设小说|Fiction that draws attention to its own artificiality as a literary construct, often by employing self-reflexive techniques such as breaking the fourth wall, addressing the reader directly, or commenting on the process of storytelling itself.  Metafictions often blur the lines between reality and fiction, challenging the reader's assumptions about the nature of storytelling and the relationship between author, text, and reader. |Example:  Many postmodern novels are examples of metafiction, playing with the conventions of storytelling and highlighting the constructed nature of narrative.  许多后现代小说都是元小说的例子，它们玩弄讲故事的惯例，并突出叙事的建构性。
