词源:

* **pro-**:  A prefix meaning "in favor of," "supporting," or "for."  It derives from Latin.

* **Bolsheviks**:  From Russian большевики (bol'sheviki), literally meaning "majoritarian," referring to the majority faction within the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party that seized power in the 1917 October Revolution.


用法说明:

This term is primarily used as an adjective to describe individuals, groups, or entities that favored the Bolsheviks and their ideology.  It's a descriptive term, not a noun or verb in itself.


例句:

The pro-Bolshevik sentiment was strong in the industrial cities.  亲布尔什维克的情绪在工业城市中很强烈。

Many pro-Bolshevik intellectuals fled from Russia after the revolution. 许多亲布尔什维克的知识分子在革命后逃离了俄罗斯。


注意：由于该词语指的是一个特定历史时期和政治派别，因此其使用场景相对有限，主要出现在历史研究、政治分析等语境中。  它不会像普通形容词那样频繁出现。  现代英语中，更常见的表达方式可能是“supporters of the Bolsheviks”或“pro-communist”。
