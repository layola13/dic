词源:

The word "nondocumental" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "documental" (relating to or characteristic of a documentary film or style).  The word "documentary" itself ultimately derives from the noun "document,"  referring to something that provides evidence or proof.
