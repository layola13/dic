resultant:/rɪˈzʌltənt/ | adj., n. | 结果的；合成的；合力；结果 | Resultant means resulting from an action or process; it can also describe a force or effect that is the combined result of two or more forces.  As a noun, it refers to this combined result, especially in physics. | The resultant force pushed the car forward.  = 合力推动汽车前进。 | The resultant of the two vectors is a third vector. = 这两个向量的合力是一个第三向量。 | consequent, resulting, combined |  unrelated, independent, original


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The resultant force is calculated using vector addition. = 合力是用向量加法计算的。
The resultant effect is often unpredictable. = 结果效应往往是不可预测的。


一般过去时:
The resultant damage was extensive. = 造成的破坏是巨大的。
The resultant product was unsatisfactory. = 最终产品不令人满意。


现在完成时:
The resultant changes have been significant. = 产生的变化是显著的。
The resultant improvements have been impressive. = 取得的改进令人印象深刻。


过去完成时:
The resultant confusion had already been cleared up. = 造成的混乱已经被清理干净了。
The resultant problems had been anticipated. = 预料到了由此产生的问题。


将来时:
The resultant improvements will be substantial. = 未来改进将是巨大的。
The resultant effects will be studied further. = 将对产生的影响进行进一步的研究。


虚拟语气:
If the resultant force were greater, the object would move faster. = 如果合力更大，物体就会移动得更快。
If the resultant product were better, we would have sold more. = 如果最终产品更好，我们会卖得更多。


被动语态:
The resultant changes were carefully documented. = 产生的变化被仔细记录下来。
The resultant effect was largely ignored. = 结果效应在很大程度上被忽视了。


疑问句:
What is the resultant vector? = 合向量是多少？
What is the resultant pressure? = 合压力是多少？


否定句:
The resultant force was not strong enough. = 合力不够强。
The resultant outcome was not as expected. = 结果并非预期那样。


PHRASE->
the resultant force = 合力
the resultant vector = 合向量
the resultant effect = 综合效应，最终效果
the resultant stress = 综合压力，最终应力
the resultant strain = 综合应变，最终应变
