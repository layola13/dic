词源:  Derived from the verb "inoculate," which comes from the Latin word "inoculare," meaning "to engraft" or "to inoculate."  The Latin word itself is a combination of "in-" (into) and "oculare" (to bud or graft).  The original sense was the grafting of plants, but it later came to refer to the introduction of a substance into a living organism, particularly for medical purposes.
