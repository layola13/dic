drillability's:/ˌdrɪləˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可钻性；钻孔性 | The ease with which a material can be drilled.  It's a measure of how easily a hole can be created in a substance using drilling equipment.  This property is crucial in various fields, including mining, construction, and oil exploration. | Example: The rock's drillability was assessed before the mining operation began.  岩石的可钻性在采矿作业开始前进行了评估。 The drillability's of different rock types vary significantly. 不同类型岩石的可钻性差异很大。|近义词：permeability, machinability | 反义词：indrillability
