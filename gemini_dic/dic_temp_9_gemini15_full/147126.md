词源:

The word "overlocker" is a compound word. It combines "overlock," describing the type of stitch created, with "-er," a suffix that forms nouns indicating tools or agents.  "Overlock" itself comes from "over" (meaning above or beyond) and "lock," referring to the interlocking of threads to secure the seam.  Therefore, the machine's name directly describes its function: it "locks" the stitches "over" the edge of the fabric.
