词源:

The adverb "glancingly" is derived from the verb "glance," which comes from the Old French word "glacer," meaning "to shine, glitter," and ultimately from the Vulgar Latin "glaciāre."  The shift in meaning from "shining" to "glimpse" likely arose from the association of a quick, bright reflection with a brief, fleeting look.


用法说明：

Glancingly is an adverb that modifies verbs, describing how an action is performed.  It indicates that the action is done with a quick, superficial glance rather than a careful or detailed examination.  It often implies a lack of thoroughness or a casual observation.  The focus is on the brevity and incompleteness of the observation, not necessarily the speed.
