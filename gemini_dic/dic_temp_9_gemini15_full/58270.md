词源:
The word "drunken" comes from the Old English word "druncen," which is the past participle of the verb "drincan" (to drink).  The suffix "-en" indicates a past participle, signifying a state resulting from the action of drinking.  The evolution of the word reflects the historical connection between the act of drinking and the state of being drunk.
