词源:
The word "ice lolly" is a compound word. "Ice" refers to the frozen water component, while "lolly" is a colloquial term for a sweet treat, particularly one on a stick. The origin of "lolly" is uncertain, but it's believed to be a shortened form of "lollipop," which itself has a somewhat obscure etymology, possibly derived from a Dutch word.  The term "ice lolly" is primarily used in British English.  In American English, "popsicle" is the more common equivalent.
