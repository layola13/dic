geotropic:/ˌdʒioʊˈtrɒpɪk/| adj.|向地性，向地性的|Relating to or exhibiting geotropism, the growth response of a plant to gravity.  Geotropic growth can be either positive (towards the earth) or negative (away from the earth).|例句：The roots of the plant showed positive geotropism, growing downwards towards the pull of gravity. 植物的根表现出正向地性，向下生长朝向地心引力。

The stem exhibited negative geotropism, growing upwards against gravity. 茎表现出负向地性，向上生长对抗地心引力。|近义词：gravitropic|反义词：apogeotropic


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The roots show positive geotropism. = 根显示出正向地性。
This plant exhibits negative geotropism in its stem growth. = 这植物的茎生长表现出负向地性。


一般过去时:
The seedlings showed a strong positive geotropism. = 幼苗显示出强烈的正向地性。
The experiment demonstrated the plant's geotropic response to gravity. = 实验证明了植物对地心引力的向地性反应。


现在完成时:
Scientists have observed various forms of geotropism in plants. = 科学家们已经观察到植物的各种向地性形式。
Researchers have determined the genes responsible for geotropism in certain species. = 研究人员已经确定了某些物种向地性反应的基因。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, we had hypothesized that the plant would display negative geotropism. = 在实验之前，我们假设该植物会表现出负向地性。
The researchers had already documented similar geotropic responses in related species. = 研究人员已经记录了相关物种中类似的向地性反应。


将来时:
We will investigate the effects of light on geotropism in our next study. = 我们将在下一项研究中调查光对向地性的影响。
The experiment will demonstrate the role of auxin in geotropic growth. = 该实验将证明生长素在向地性生长中的作用。


虚拟语气:
If the plant lacked gravity sensors, it would not exhibit geotropism. = 如果植物缺乏重力传感器，它就不会表现出向地性。
It is hypothesized that if the roots were damaged, the geotropic response would be impaired. = 假设如果根部受损，向地性反应就会受损。


被动语态:
The geotropic response of the plant was carefully measured. = 植物的向地性反应被仔细测量。
The role of gravity in geotropism has been extensively studied. = 重力在向地性中的作用已被广泛研究。


疑问句:
Does this plant exhibit positive or negative geotropism? = 这植物表现出正向地性还是负向地性？
What factors influence the geotropic response in plants? = 哪些因素会影响植物的向地性反应？


否定句:
The plant did not show any significant geotropism. = 该植物没有表现出任何明显的向地性。
The results did not support the hypothesis of negative geotropism. = 结果不支持负向地性的假设。


PHRASE->
positive geotropism = 正向地性
negative geotropism = 负向地性
gravitropism (synonym) = 向重力性
geotropic response = 向地性反应
geotropic curvature = 向地性弯曲
