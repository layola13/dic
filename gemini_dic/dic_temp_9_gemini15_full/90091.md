词源:
The word "hosting" comes from the noun "host," which has roots in Old English "hōst" meaning "master of a house, landlord."  Over time, its meaning broadened to include the act of receiving guests and providing hospitality. The verb form "to host" and the noun "hosting" developed from this base, reflecting the act of providing a space, platform, or service for others.
