词源:

The word "dressmaker" is a compound word combining "dress" and "maker."  "Dress" comes from the Old French "dresser" meaning "to make straight, arrange," and later "to clothe."  "Maker" comes from the Old English "macere" meaning "to make, create."  Therefore, "dressmaker" literally means "one who makes dresses."
