词源:
The word "gossamer" ultimately derives from the Old English word *gōsōmre, meaning "summer gauze."  The word was originally associated with the fine cobwebs seen floating in the air during the summer months.  Over time, the word expanded to describe anything light, delicate, and almost transparent.
