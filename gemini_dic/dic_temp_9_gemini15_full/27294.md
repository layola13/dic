The word "calvessnout" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism, a made-up word, or a misspelling.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  To provide a response in the requested format, I need a valid English word.
