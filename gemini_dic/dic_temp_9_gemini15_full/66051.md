Etymology:

The word "exasperatedness" is derived from the verb "exasperate," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "exasperare."  "Ex" is a prefix meaning "out" or "completely," while "asperare" means "to make rough" or "to roughen."  Thus, the original sense was to make something rough or harsh, and by extension, to irritate or annoy intensely.  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "exasperated" into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being exasperated.
