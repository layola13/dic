lactates:/ˈlækteɪts/| v.|乳酸盐化；产生乳酸|To produce or secrete lactic acid.  Lactates refers to the process of producing or secreting lactic acid, often in the context of muscle metabolism during strenuous activity.  The term can also refer to the salts of lactic acid.|例句：During intense exercise, muscles lactate, leading to fatigue.  剧烈运动时，肌肉会产生乳酸，导致疲劳。

例句：The bacteria in yogurt lactate, producing the characteristic sour taste. 酸奶中的细菌产生乳酸，从而产生其特有的酸味。


近义词：ferments (in the context of lactic acid production) 发酵 (在乳酸生产的语境下)

反义词：There isn't a direct antonym, as it describes a process.  没有直接的反义词，因为它描述的是一个过程。


词性:动词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The muscles lactate during intense exercise. = 肌肉在剧烈运动时会产生乳酸。
Bacteria lactate to produce yogurt. = 细菌通过乳酸发酵生产酸奶。


一般过去时:
His muscles lactated after the marathon. = 他马拉松后肌肉产生了乳酸。
The milk lactated and soured. = 牛奶发酵变酸了。


现在完成时:
The athlete has lactated excessively due to overtraining. = 运动员由于过度训练而产生了过多的乳酸。
The bacteria have lactated and turned the milk into yogurt. = 细菌已经发酵，把牛奶变成了酸奶。


过去完成时:
His muscles had lactated before he collapsed. = 他倒下之前肌肉已经产生了乳酸。
The milk had lactated significantly by the time it was discovered. = 牛奶在被发现时已经显著发酵了。


将来时:
His muscles will lactate if he pushes himself too hard. = 如果他过于努力，他的肌肉就会产生乳酸。
The milk will lactate if it's left at room temperature for too long. = 如果牛奶在室温下放置太久，它就会发酵。


虚拟语气:
If the bacteria lactated more efficiently, the yogurt would be more sour. = 如果细菌更有效地产生乳酸，酸奶就会更酸。
If he hadn't lactated so much, he wouldn't have felt so fatigued. = 如果他没有产生那么多乳酸，他就不会感到那么疲劳。


被动语态:
Lactic acid is lactated by the muscles during exercise. = 肌肉在运动过程中产生乳酸。
Yogurt is produced when milk is lactated by bacteria. = 当牛奶被细菌发酵时，就会产生酸奶。


疑问句:
Does intense exercise always cause muscles to lactate? = 剧烈运动是否总是会导致肌肉产生乳酸？
Why do some bacteria lactate while others don't? = 为什么有些细菌会产生乳酸而有些不会？


否定句:
The muscles did not lactate significantly during the low-intensity workout. = 在低强度训练中，肌肉并没有显著产生乳酸。
The milk did not lactate because it was kept refrigerated. = 牛奶没有发酵，因为它被冷藏了。


PHRASE->
muscle lactates = 肌肉产生乳酸
bacteria lactate = 细菌产生乳酸
lactate threshold = 乳酸阈值
lactate dehydrogenase = 乳酸脱氢酶
anaerobic lactate production = 无氧乳酸产生
