词源:

The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great extent) and "sophistication."  "Sophistication" itself derives from the French "sophistication" and ultimately from the Greek "sophistēs" (σοφιστής), meaning "skilled in argument, wiseacre."  The original meaning related to skilled debaters, often implying a degree of cleverness that could be deceptive or manipulative.  The modern meaning of "sophistication" evolved to encompass refinement and worldly knowledge, but also retains a hint of artificiality when used in the context of "oversophistication".
