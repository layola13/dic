eure:/ˈjʊər/ | pron. |你们的，你们的（东西）|  The word "eure" is the second-person plural possessive pronoun in some older forms of German and some related languages, equivalent to "your" in English.  It is rarely used in modern standard German, having been largely replaced by "euer".| 例句： Eure Bücher sind auf dem Tisch. (Your books are on the table.) |近义词:your (English equivalent), euer (Modern German equivalent)|反义词: N/A | pronoun


USAGE->
This word is primarily relevant to older forms of German or dialects.  Modern standard German uses "euer" instead. There is no typical usage across tenses like "what" because it is a pronoun and not a verb.  Example sentences will be in older German, reflecting the historical usage.


PHRASE->
This word does not readily form common phrases in the way a word like "what" does in English.  Phrases using "eure" would be highly dependent on the specific dialect or older form of German in which it appears.  Modern German would utilize "euer" instead in similar phrase constructions.
