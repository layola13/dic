radiations:/ˌreɪdiˈeɪʃənz/| n.|辐射；放射物|The emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or as moving subatomic particles, especially high-energy particles which cause ionization.  Radiation can be ionizing (like X-rays and gamma rays) or non-ionizing (like radio waves and visible light).|例句：Exposure to high levels of radiations can be harmful to human health.  长期暴露在高剂量辐射下会危害人体健康。

例句：The scientist studied the radiations emitted by the radioactive material.  科学家研究了放射性物质发出的辐射。


近义词：emissions, emanations|反义词：absorption
