The word "fenit" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word.
* **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name (person, place, or thing) or a brand name not widely known.
* **It's a technical term:** It could be jargon specific to a certain field (e.g., science, engineering).
* **It's a neologism:** It might be a newly coined word not yet in common usage.
* **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language without being integrated into standard English.

If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
