词源:
The word "seek" originates from the Old English verb "sēcan," meaning "to go, to proceed, to travel."  This in turn is related to the Proto-Germanic verb "*sōkōnan," and ultimately traces back to a Proto-Indo-European root, possibly *sek-, associated with the idea of "following" or "tracking."  The modern English word retains the sense of active searching and pursuing a goal.
