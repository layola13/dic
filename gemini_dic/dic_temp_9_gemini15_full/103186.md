Etymology:

The word "Jesuitic" derives from the Society of Jesus, also known as the Jesuits, a religious order of the Catholic Church founded in 1540 by Ignatius of Loyola.  Over time, the term acquired a negative connotation, associating the Jesuits' reputation for intellectual prowess and skilled debate with a perception of clever but potentially dishonest argumentation.  The word reflects a historical perception, not necessarily a contemporary one.
