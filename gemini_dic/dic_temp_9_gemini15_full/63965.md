词源:
From Middle French épisode, from Old French, from Late Latin episodium, from Greek ἐπεισόδιον (episódion), from ἐπι- (epi-) + ὄδος (ódos) "way".  Literally meaning "incident," "something that comes in between," or "an insertion."  The modern meaning evolved from its use in ancient Greek drama where it referred to an incident or episode inserted into a play.
