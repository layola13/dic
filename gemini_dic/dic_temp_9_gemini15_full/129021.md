The word "nisnow" is not a recognized word in English.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word type, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a different language.  Please double-check the spelling or provide more context.
