词源:

The word "extension" comes from the Old French word "extension," which itself derives from the Latin word "extensio," meaning "a stretching out."  The Latin word is formed from the verb "extendere," meaning "to stretch out," which is composed of the prefix "ex-" (out) and "tendere" (to stretch).
