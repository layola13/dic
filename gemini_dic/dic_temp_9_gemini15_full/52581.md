diffusivity:/ˌdɪfjuːˈzɪvɪti/| n. |扩散率，扩散性 |The ability of a substance to spread or be spread out.  It often refers to the rate at which a substance spreads through a medium.  In physics and chemistry, it's a measure of how quickly a substance spreads out in a given environment.  | Example: The diffusivity of oxygen in water is lower than in air.  氧气在水中的扩散率低于在空气中。|近义词：dispersibility, permeability, spreadability |反义词：impermeability, stagnation
