This request is impossible to fulfill completely as the provided word "quantom" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling of "quantum."  I will proceed with the analysis assuming it was a typo.


**quantum:** /ˈkwɑːntəm/ (US) /ˈkwɒntəm/ (UK) | n. | 量子 |  A discrete quantity of energy proportional in magnitude to the frequency of the radiation it represents.  It is the fundamental unit of energy in quantum mechanics.  In a broader sense, it refers to a distinct, indivisible unit of something. |


**英文解析:**

The word "quantum" derives from the Latin word "quantus," meaning "how much" or "how great." In physics, it represents the smallest unit of a physical entity (energy, momentum, etc.) that can exist independently.  The concept is central to quantum mechanics, which governs the behavior of matter at the atomic and subatomic levels.  It's often used metaphorically to refer to a significant or fundamental unit or step in any field.

**例句:**

* Quantum mechanics is a complex but essential branch of physics. = 量子力学是一个复杂但必不可少的物理学分支。

* The company made a quantum leap in its sales figures this quarter. = 公司本季度销售额实现了飞跃。


**近义词:**

unit, portion, particle, increment, amount (depending on context)


**反义词:**

There isn't a direct antonym, as "quantum" refers to a fundamental unit.  The opposite concept would be something continuous or infinitely divisible, rather than a single word.


**词性:**

Noun


**USAGE->**

(Since "quantum" is primarily a noun, verb conjugations etc. don't apply directly. The usage examples below focus on its usage in sentences.)

**Simple Present:**

* The experiment demonstrates quantum entanglement. = 实验演示了量子纠缠。
* This research explores the nature of quantum fluctuations. = 这项研究探索了量子涨落的本质。


**Simple Past:**

* Scientists discovered quantum tunneling in the 1920s. = 科学家在20世纪20年代发现了量子隧穿效应。
*  The presentation explained quantum superposition. = 演示文解释了量子叠加。


**Present Perfect:**

* Physicists have observed many quantum phenomena. = 物理学家已经观察到许多量子现象。
*  They have made significant progress in quantum computing. = 他们在量子计算方面取得了重大进展。


**Past Perfect:**

* Before the experiment, they had studied quantum field theory. = 在实验之前，他们学习过量子场论。
*  We had not understood the implications of quantum mechanics fully. = 我们还没有完全理解量子力学的含义。


**Future Simple:**

* They will conduct further research on quantum gravity. = 他们将对量子引力进行进一步研究。
*  Scientists believe they will create a quantum computer soon. = 科学家相信他们很快就会制造出一台量子计算机。


**Passive Voice:**

*  Quantum effects were observed in the experiment. = 在实验中观察到了量子效应。
*  Quantum computers are being developed worldwide. = 全世界都在研发量子计算机。


**PHRASE->**

* Quantum physics: 量子物理学
* Quantum entanglement: 量子纠缠
* Quantum leap: 量子飞跃 (a significant advance)
* Quantum computer: 量子计算机
* Quantum mechanics: 量子力学


Please note that the usage examples are tailored to the scientific context of the word "quantum," where it is most commonly used.  In less technical contexts, the usage will be more metaphorical and less precise.
