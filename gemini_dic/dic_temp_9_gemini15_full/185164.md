The word "retistene" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or related word?

2. **It's a neologism or technical term:**  It might be a newly coined word, a term specific to a particular field (like medicine or a specialized branch of science), or a proper noun (like a place name). If this is the case, please provide more context.

3. **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language.  If so, specifying the language would help.


To provide the analysis you requested, I need a correctly spelled and contextually appropriate word.
