词源:
The word "notary" comes from the Latin word "notarius," meaning "writer," "stenographer," or "shorthand writer."  In Roman times, notarii were scribes who recorded official documents.  Over time, the role evolved, and notaries gained the authority to certify documents and perform other legal functions.
