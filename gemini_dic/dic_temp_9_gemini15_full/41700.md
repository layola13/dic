词源:  The word "corrivalry" is a combination of "corrival" (meaning a rival or competitor) and the suffix "-ry," which denotes a state, condition, or practice.  "Corrival" itself comes from the Latin words "cor-" (meaning "together" or "with") and "rivalis" (meaning "rival").  Therefore, "corrivalry" literally suggests a state of rivalry where competitors are closely matched or operating in tandem.
