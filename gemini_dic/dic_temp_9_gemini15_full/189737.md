saltigradae:/ˌsæltɪˈɡreɪdiː/| n.| 盐分梯度 | Salt gradient refers to the gradual change in salinity (salt concentration) over a distance, typically in a body of water.  It's a key factor in various oceanographic and hydrological processes.  For instance, it influences water density, which in turn drives ocean currents and mixing. Salt gradients also play a role in the formation of estuaries where freshwater rivers meet saltwater seas. | Example: The researchers measured the salt gradient across the estuary to understand the mixing dynamics of freshwater and seawater.  The steep salt gradient near the river mouth created a strong halocline. | 近义词: salinity gradient, concentration gradient | 反义词: uniform salinity, homogenous salinity | 名词
