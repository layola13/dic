semimetallic:/ˌsɛmiˈmɛtælɪk/| adj. |半金属的|Possessing properties intermediate between those of a metal and a nonmetal. Semimetals, also known as metalloids, are elements that exhibit properties of both metals and nonmetals. They are often semiconductors, meaning their electrical conductivity can be controlled by doping or other means.  Their appearance can vary, but they are often brittle and shiny. |Example: Silicon is a semimetallic element used extensively in electronics. 硅是一种广泛用于电子领域的半金属元素。 Boron is another example of a semimetallic element. 硼是另一种半金属元素的例子。|近义词：metalloid|反义词：metallic, nonmetallic
