词源:
The word "overexpansive" is a compound word.  "Over-" is a prefix indicating excess or to a great extent. "Expansive" comes from the verb "expand," ultimately from the Latin "expandere," meaning "to spread out."  Therefore, "overexpansive" literally means "excessively spread out" or "excessively extending."
