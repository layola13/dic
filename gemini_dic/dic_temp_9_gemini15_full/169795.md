Word Origin:

The word "prosaicness" derives from the adjective "prosaic," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "prosaïque," meaning "prose-like."  This, in turn, comes from the Latin word "prosa," meaning "prose" (as opposed to poetry).  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, indicating a state or quality of being prosaic.
