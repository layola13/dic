词源:
From magnetite + -itic.  Magnetite itself derives from the Greek word  μαγνήτης (magnētēs), meaning "magnet stone," ultimately referring to Magnesia, a region in ancient Greece where magnetite was found.  The suffix "-itic" is used to form adjectives indicating a connection or relationship to a particular substance or mineral.
