interatrial: /ˌɪntərˈeɪtriəl/ | adj. | 心房间的 | Relating to the space or area between the atria of the heart.  Describes structures, processes, or conditions involving both atria. |  Example: Interatrial septal defect is a common congenital heart defect. 心房间隔缺损是一种常见的心脏先天性缺陷。  |近义词：atrial, bicatrial (in certain contexts)| 反义词：intraventricular (relating to the ventricles)| 词性：形容词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The interatrial pathway conducts electrical impulses between the atria. = 心房间的通路传导心房之间的电脉冲。

一般过去时:
The doctor examined the patient for interatrial shunts. = 医生检查病人是否有心房间的分流。
The study investigated interatrial conduction delays in elderly patients. = 该研究调查了老年患者的心房间传导延迟。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several genes associated with interatrial septal defects. = 研究人员已经确定了几个与心房间隔缺损相关的基因。

The patient had experienced episodes of interatrial arrhythmias prior to hospitalization. = 病人在住院前曾经历过心房间心律失常的发作。


将来时:
Future studies will focus on the mechanisms of interatrial conduction. = 未来的研究将集中在心房间传导的机制上。
Improved imaging techniques will allow for more precise assessment of interatrial septal defects. = 改进的成像技术将允许更精确地评估心房间隔缺损。


虚拟语气:
If the interatrial pressure gradient were significantly increased, it could lead to complications. = 如果心房间的压力梯度显著增加，可能会导致并发症。
It would be beneficial to understand better the role of interatrial pressure in atrial fibrillation. = 更好地了解心房间压力在心房颤动中的作用将是有益的。


被动语态:
The interatrial septum was carefully examined during the surgery. = 在手术过程中仔细检查了心房间隔。
Interatrial pressure gradients are routinely measured during cardiac catheterization. = 心脏导管检查期间通常会测量心房间的压力梯度。


疑问句:
Is there any evidence of interatrial shunting in this patient? = 这个病人有心房间分流的证据吗？
What is the impact of interatrial delay on atrial fibrillation? = 心房间延迟对心房颤动的影响是什么？


否定句:
There was no evidence of significant interatrial communication. = 没有显著的心房间交流的证据。
The patient did not present with symptoms of interatrial block. = 病人没有出现心房间阻滞的症状。


PHRASE->
interatrial septum 心房间隔
