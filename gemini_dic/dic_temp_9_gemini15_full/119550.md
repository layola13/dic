microsporangium:/ˌmaɪkroʊspəˈreɪdʒiəm/| n. |小孢子囊|A microsporangium is a structure in plants that produces microspores, which are the precursors to pollen grains in seed plants and spores in other plants.  It's typically found within the anther of flowering plants and other similar structures in other plant groups.  |例句：The microsporangium undergoes meiosis to produce haploid microspores.|近义词：pollen sac (in some contexts)|反义词：megasporangium
