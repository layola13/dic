protoplast:/ˈproʊtoʊplæst/| n. |原生质体，原质体|A protoplast is a plant or bacterial cell that has had its cell wall removed.  It is essentially the cell's contents (cytoplasm, organelles, and membrane) without the rigid outer wall. Protoplasts are used in plant genetic engineering and cell fusion experiments because their membranes are permeable and can fuse with other protoplasts.|Example: Researchers used protoplasts to introduce a gene for herbicide resistance into a crop plant.|近义词:cell (in some contexts)|反义词:None


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The scientist observes the protoplast under a microscope. = 科学家在显微镜下观察原生质体。
Plant cells lack a cell wall when they are protoplasts. = 植物细胞在成为原生质体时缺乏细胞壁。

一般过去时:
They fused two protoplasts to create a hybrid plant. = 他们融合了两个原生质体以创造一种杂交植物。
The researchers removed the cell wall to obtain the protoplast. = 研究人员去除了细胞壁以获得原生质体。

现在完成时:
Scientists have used protoplasts in genetic engineering for decades. = 科学家几十年来一直在基因工程中使用原生质体。
Researchers have successfully created hybrid plants using protoplast fusion. = 研究人员已经成功地利用原生质体融合创造了杂交植物。

过去完成时:
The experiment had already begun before the protoplasts were prepared. = 在原生质体准备好之前，实验已经开始了。
Before the fusion, the protoplasts had been treated with enzymes. = 在融合之前，原生质体已经用酶处理过。

将来时:
They will use protoplasts to study cell wall regeneration. = 他们将使用原生质体来研究细胞壁的再生。
We will analyze the gene expression in the protoplast after treatment. = 我们将在处理后分析原生质体中的基因表达。

虚拟语气:
If we had more protoplasts, we could conduct more experiments. = 如果我们有更多原生质体，我们可以进行更多实验。
It would be easier to introduce genes if the protoplasts were more stable. = 如果原生质体更稳定，引入基因会更容易。

被动语态:
The protoplasts were treated with an enzyme solution. = 原生质体用酶溶液处理。
The cell wall was removed to create the protoplast. = 去除细胞壁以产生原生质体。

疑问句:
How many protoplasts were used in the experiment? = 实验中使用了多少原生质体？
What is the viability of the protoplasts after treatment? = 处理后原生质体的活力如何？

否定句:
The protoplasts did not survive the treatment. = 原生质体没有在处理中存活。
They could not fuse the protoplasts successfully. = 他们无法成功融合原生质体。


PHRASE->
protoplast fusion = 原生质体融合
protoplast isolation = 原生质体分离
protoplast culture = 原生质体培养
protoplast transformation = 原生质体转化
plant protoplast = 植物原生质体
