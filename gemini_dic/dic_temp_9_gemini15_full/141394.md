The word "opertaneous" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no recognized pronunciation, definition, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, a response following your requested format is impossible.  It's possible there's a misspelling or it's a neologism (newly coined word).  If you could provide more context or clarify the spelling, I may be able to offer assistance.
