The word "prevoiding" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your format is impossible.  To help you, I need clarification:

* **Is it a misspelling?**  If so, what word were you intending to use?  Commonly misspelled words that might be confused with a word starting with "pre-" could be investigated.

* **Is it a newly coined word within a specific context?** If so, please provide the context (sentence, paragraph, field of study) where you encountered this word. This will help in understanding its intended meaning.


Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.
