英文解析:The word "nonincidental" is formed by the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "incidental," which means happening by chance or as a minor consequence. Therefore, "nonincidental" signifies something that is not accidental or coincidental; it is important, essential, or deliberate.  It emphasizes that something is not a minor or insignificant detail, but rather a key element or a consequence of intentional action.

词源:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not," "opposite of," or "lacking."  Derived from Old French *non*, ultimately from Latin *non*.

* **incidental**:  Derived from the Latin word *incidens*, present participle of *incidere* "to fall upon, happen," from *in-* "on, upon" + *cadere* "to fall."  Thus, originally meaning something that falls upon or happens by chance.
