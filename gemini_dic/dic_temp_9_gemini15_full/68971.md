词源:
The word "fathom" originates from Old English *fæþm, meaning "the outstretched arms," referring to a unit of length used to measure the depth of water.  This was a practical measurement using one's arm span.  The verb sense developed from this, meaning to measure the depth and later extending to the metaphorical sense of understanding something profound.
