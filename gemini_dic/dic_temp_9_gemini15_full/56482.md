The word "domableness" is derived from the adjective "domable," which itself comes from the verb "tame"  (meaning to subdue or control an animal) and the suffix "-able" (meaning capable of being).  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, "domableness" means the quality of being capable of being tamed.
