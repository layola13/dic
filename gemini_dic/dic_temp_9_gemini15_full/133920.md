英文解析:Nonhabitualness refers to the state or quality of not being habitual or customary. It describes something that is not done regularly or routinely; it's infrequent, unusual, or unexpected.  The word highlights the deviation from established patterns of behavior or occurrence.


例句:

The sudden downpour highlighted the nonhabitualness of the usually sunny weather.  突如其来的倾盆大雨突显了通常晴朗天气下的非惯常性。


词源:

The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), the adjective "habitual" (meaning "done or occurring regularly; customary"), and the suffix "-ness" (meaning "the state or quality of").  Therefore, it literally means "the state of not being habitual".  "Habitual" itself derives from the Latin word "habitus," meaning "condition, state, habit."


用法说明:

Nonhabitualness is primarily used as a noun to describe a situation or characteristic.  It's less frequently used than words like "unusualness" or "infrequency," but it emphasizes the lack of established routine or custom.  It's often used in academic or formal writing to precisely convey the idea of something being outside the norm.
