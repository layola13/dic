词源:
The word "distillation" comes from the Middle English word "distillacioun," derived from the Old French "distillacion" and ultimately from the Latin "distillatio," a combination of "distillare" (to drip, drop down) and the suffix "-atio" (action or process).  The Latin verb "distillare" itself is formed from "de-" (down) and "stillare" (to drip, fall drop by drop).  Therefore, the word's roots directly reflect the process of liquid dripping or falling drop by drop during the distillation process.
