Etymology:  The word "conjointness" derives from the adjective "conjoint," which itself comes from the Old French word "conjoint," meaning "joined together."  The prefix "con-" means "together," and "joint" derives from the Latin word "junctus," the past participle of "jungere," meaning "to join."  Therefore, the word's roots clearly indicate a sense of unity and connection.
