词源:

The word "kushy" likely originated in the late 19th or early 20th century. Its etymology is uncertain, but it's possibly related to the word "cosh," meaning a blow or a club.  The connection is tenuous, with the suggested meaning possibly evolving from the idea of a "soft" or easy life, perhaps in contrast to a harsh or difficult one. Another possible origin suggests a connection to the Hindi word "kusha," meaning "grass," but this link is also uncertain.  The exact origin remains debated among etymologists.
