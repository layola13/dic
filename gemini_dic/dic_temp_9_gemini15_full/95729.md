词源:
The word "inconsiderableness" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the adjective "considerate" (meaning showing consideration for the needs of others), the suffix "-able" (making it an adjective meaning "capable of being"), and the suffix "-ness" (turning the adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality).  Therefore, it literally means "the state of not being considerate."
