词源:

The origin of "mumbo-jumbo" is uncertain, but it's believed to derive from African languages, possibly from the Kimbundu word "mambo-mambo" or a similar term referring to fetish objects or rituals.  It entered English in the 18th century, initially associated with African religious practices and often used in a derogatory way.  Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass any nonsensical or unintelligible speech.
