photo-potential:/ˌfoʊtoʊpəˈtɛnʃəl/ | n. |光电势，光电位 |The potential difference generated in a photosensitive material when exposed to light.  This potential is typically used to measure the light intensity or to generate an electric current.  |Example: The photo-potential across the silicon diode increased proportionally to the light intensity. 光电二极管上的光电势与光强成正比增加。|近义词：photovoltage |反义词：无
