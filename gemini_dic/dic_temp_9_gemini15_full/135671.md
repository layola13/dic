nonprelatic: /ˌnɒnˌprɛˈlætɪk/ | adj. | 非主教的，非教士的 | Not relating to or characteristic of a prelate or the clergy.  This word describes something or someone that is not associated with high-ranking members of the clergy or their authority.


英文解析: The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "prelatic," which relates to prelates (high-ranking clergy members like bishops, archbishops, etc.). Therefore, "nonprelatic" signifies the absence of characteristics associated with prelates or the clergy.
