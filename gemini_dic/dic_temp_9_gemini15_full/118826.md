metantimonate:/ˌmɛtænˈtɪməneɪt/| n. |偏锑酸盐|A metantimonate is a salt or ester of metantimonic acid (HSbO3).  These compounds contain the SbO3− anion. They are often found in inorganic chemistry and are less common than other antimony compounds.  The precise properties vary depending on the counterion. |Example:  Sodium metantimonate is used in some ceramics.  钠偏锑酸盐用于某些陶瓷制品中。|近义词:antimonate(锑酸盐，范围更广)|反义词: N/A


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a chemical context, and therefore its usage is limited to descriptions within chemical reactions, formulas, and properties.  There is no verb conjugation or tense variation directly applicable to the word "metantimonate" itself, as it's a noun.  However, it can be used within sentences structured in various tenses.
