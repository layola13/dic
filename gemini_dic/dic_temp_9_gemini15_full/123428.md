词源:
monopolised comes from the word "monopoly," which itself originates from the Greek words "monos" (μόνος), meaning "single," "alone," or "only," and "polein" (πωλεῖν), meaning "to sell."  Therefore, a monopoly literally means "single sale" or "sole selling right."  The "-ised" suffix indicates the past participle form of the verb, signifying the action of monopolizing something.
