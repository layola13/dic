词源:
The word "raze" ultimately derives from the Latin word "radere," meaning "to scrape, shave, or erase."  This reflects the original meaning of the word, which involved scraping or leveling something to the ground.  The evolution through Old French ("raser") to Modern English preserved this core meaning of complete destruction.
