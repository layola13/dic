词源:
The word "schmaltz" (from which "schmaltziest" derives) is a Yiddish word, ultimately of German origin.  It originally referred to rendered chicken fat, but its meaning extended to describe something excessively sentimental or emotional, often in a cloying or insincere way.  The association might be due to the richness and potentially overwhelming nature of the fat. The superlative "-iest" is added to create the adjective "schmaltziest".
