词源:
Ultimately derived from the Old English word *hergian*, meaning "to ravage," "to lay waste," or "to plunder."  The sense of "to distress" developed later, likely from the image of a field being ravaged and left in a state of distress.  The connection is that both the physical act of harrowing (to cultivate land with a harrow) and the emotional state of being harrowed involve a sense of disturbance and turmoil.
