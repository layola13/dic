词源:
The word "interlacing" comes from the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and the verb "lace," meaning "to fasten or bind with a cord or thread."  The original meaning was the physical act of weaving threads together.  The meaning has since expanded to include figurative uses, such as the intertwining of ideas or narratives.
