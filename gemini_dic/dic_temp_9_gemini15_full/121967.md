词源:  The word "missish" is derived from "miss," a term historically used to address unmarried women. The "-ish" suffix adds a diminutive or slightly pejorative quality, suggesting a resemblance to or a slight degree of something. Thus, "missish" implies having characteristics associated with a young, unmarried woman, often in an exaggerated or affected manner.  It's important to note that the etymology reflects historical gender roles and societal expectations, and the word's usage today might be considered outdated or even offensive depending on the context.
