词源:

The word "primordialities" is derived from the word "primordial," which comes from the Late Latin word *primordialem*,  meaning "first in order of time; original".  The suffix "-ities" denotes a state or quality. Therefore, "primordialities" signifies the state or quality of being primordial; the characteristics of origins or beginnings.
