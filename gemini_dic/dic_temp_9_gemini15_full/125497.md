This term is primarily used in chemistry and linguistics to describe compounds or words with more than one radical component. In chemistry, it refers to compounds containing multiple radicals; in linguistics, it refers to words formed from more than one root or base. | Example:  "The multiradical reaction produced a complex mixture of products."  "The analysis revealed a multiradical etymology for the word." |近义词:polyradical (chemistry)| 反义词: monoradical (chemistry) |
