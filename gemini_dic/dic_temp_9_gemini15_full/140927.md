ondogram:/ˈɒndəʊɡræm/ | n. | 谐音图 | An ontogram is a pictorial representation of a word or phrase based on its sound, rather than its spelling or meaning.  It's a form of visual pun or rebus.  Unlike a pictogram, which directly represents the meaning, an ontogram uses images to represent the sounds of the words.  | Example: An ontogram for "sun" might depict a picture of a son (because "son" sounds like "sun"). | 近义词： rebus, pictogram (partially) | 反义词：无
