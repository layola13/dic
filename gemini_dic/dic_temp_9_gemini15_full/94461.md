词源：

The word "impolitic" comes from the Old French word "impolitique," which is a combination of the prefix "im-" (meaning "not") and "politique" (meaning "political" or "skilled in government").  The sense evolved from simply meaning "unskilled in politics" to the broader meaning of lacking good judgment or tact.
