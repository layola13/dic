词源:  The word "frontless" is formed from the prefix "front-" (meaning "forehead" or "face") and the suffix "-less" (meaning "without").  Historically, a "front" could refer to one's outward appearance or demeanor, particularly regarding boldness or shamelessness.  Therefore, "frontless" literally means "without a front" or "without a facade of respect or shame."  The word's meaning evolved to describe a lack of shame or respect.
