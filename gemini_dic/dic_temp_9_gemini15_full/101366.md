ionized:/ˈaɪənaɪzd/ | adj. | 电离的；离子化的 |  Describes a substance or atom that has lost or gained electrons, resulting in a net electrical charge.  This process is called ionization. | Example:  The air in a thunderstorm becomes ionized.  雷雨中的空气变得电离。  The ionized particles in the plasma screen emit light. 等离子体屏幕中的电离粒子发出光。 |近义词：charged, electrified | 反义词：neutral


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The gas is ionized by the electric field. = 气体被电场电离。
This solution remains ionized at room temperature. = 此溶液在室温下保持电离状态。


一般过去时:
The water was ionized using electrolysis. = 水通过电解被电离。
The sample was ionized before mass spectrometry analysis. = 样品在质谱分析前被电离。


现在完成时:
The air has been ionized by the radiation. = 空气已经被辐射电离。
The scientist has ionized several samples for the experiment. = 科学家已经为实验电离了几个样品。


过去完成时:
The atoms had been ionized before the reaction occurred. = 原子在反应发生之前就已经被电离。
The solution had already been ionized when the test began. = 测试开始时，溶液已经被电离了。


将来时:
The researcher will ionize the molecules tomorrow. = 研究人员明天将电离这些分子。
The air will be ionized by the high voltage. = 空气将被高电压电离。


虚拟语气:
If the gas were ionized, it would conduct electricity. = 如果气体被电离，它就会导电。
It would be helpful if the sample was already ionized. = 如果样品已经被电离，那就有帮助了。


被动语态:
The molecules are ionized by the laser. = 分子被激光电离。
The gas is being ionized in the experiment. = 气体正在实验中被电离。


疑问句:
Is the water ionized? = 水被电离了吗？
Are these particles ionized? = 这些粒子被电离了吗？


否定句:
The gas is not ionized. = 气体没有被电离。
The solution was not fully ionized. = 溶液没有完全电离。


PHRASE->
highly ionized  高度电离的
partially ionized 部分电离的
singly ionized 单电离的
doubly ionized 双电离的
ionized gas 电离气体
