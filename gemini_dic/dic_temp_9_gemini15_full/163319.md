preconfinedly: /ˌpriːkənˈfaɪndɪdli/ | adv. | 预先限制地，预先限定地 |  This word is not found in standard English dictionaries. It appears to be a newly coined word, formed by combining "preconfined" (itself a less common word) with the adverbial suffix "-ly".  The meaning can be inferred from its components:  acting in a manner that is already restricted or limited beforehand. |  There are no standard example sentences as the word is not established.  A possible example could be constructed: *The experiment was preconfinedly designed to only test one variable.* (实验事先被设计成只测试一个变量。) | 近义词:  predeterminedly, beforehand, in advance | 反义词:  openly, freely, unrestrictedly | adv.
