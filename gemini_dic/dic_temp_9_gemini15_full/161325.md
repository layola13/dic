postposition:/ˌpəʊstpəˈzɪʃən/ | n. |后置词，介词 |A word or group of words placed after the word or phrase it modifies or governs.  Postpositions are similar to prepositions but they follow the word they modify.  They are common in some languages, particularly agglutinative languages like Korean and Japanese.|例句：In Korean, particles function as postpositions.  在韩语中，助词起后置词的作用。|近义词：suffix (in some contexts), particle (in some languages) |反义词：preposition


USAGE->
This word is primarily a grammatical term and doesn't have typical verb conjugations like "what".  Therefore, providing verb tenses is inappropriate.  Instead, examples illustrating its usage in sentences will be provided.

Example 1:
The noun phrase "the book on the table" illustrates a preposition ("on") preceding its object.

The noun phrase "the man of great power" illustrates a preposition ("of") preceding its object.


Example 2:
In Japanese,  "山に" (yama ni - to the mountain)  "に" (ni) is a postposition indicating direction.

In Korean, "집에" (jibe - at home) "에" (e) is a postposition indicating location.


Example 3:
The difference between prepositions and postpositions is shown by comparing English ("on the table") with Japanese ("テーブルの上" - teburu no ue, where "no ue" means "on top of").


Example 4:
Many languages utilize both prepositions and postpositions to express grammatical relations within a sentence.  The choice often depends on the language's structure and word order.
