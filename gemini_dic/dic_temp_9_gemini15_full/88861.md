词源:  The word derives from "hoiden," an archaic term for a boisterous, ill-mannered girl or woman.  "Hoiden" itself likely originates from the Middle Dutch word "hoiden," meaning "to jump" or "to skip," reflecting the energetic and often uncontrolled movements associated with the term.  The suffix "-ish" adds a slightly diminishing or descriptive quality, suggesting a tendency toward or resemblance to the characteristics of a hoiden.
