词源:

The word "nondemocracy" is a relatively modern term formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the noun "democracy".  "Democracy" originates from the Greek words "dēmos" (people) and "kratos" (power or rule), thus literally meaning "rule by the people". The combination therefore signifies a system of governance that is not characterized by the people's rule.
