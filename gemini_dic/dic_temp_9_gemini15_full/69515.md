词源:

* **fell:**  Past tense of the verb "to fall," meaning to drop or descend.  Originates from Old English *feallan*.
* **up:**  Adverb indicating a direction or completion of an action. Old English *upp*.
* **on:**  Preposition indicating contact or encounter. Old English *on*.

The combination of "fell up on" creates a unique meaning, implying an unexpected downward movement that leads to a discovery or encounter.  The "up" here is not literal upward movement but rather adds emphasis to the unexpected nature of the discovery.
