词源:
The word "exchequer" originates from the Anglo-Norman French term "eschequier," meaning "chessboard."  This refers to the checkered cloth placed on a table where royal accounts were kept and calculated in medieval times. The pattern resembled a chessboard. Over time, "eschequier" evolved into "exchequer," and the term came to represent the institution itself responsible for managing government finances.
