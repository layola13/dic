词源:
The word "pithless" is derived from the word "pith," meaning the essential or most important part of something.  The addition of "-less" indicates the absence of this essential quality.  Therefore, "pithless" means lacking in essence, substance, or force.  The original meaning of "pith" related to the soft central part of a plant stem.  This core meaning then extended to the essential core of an argument or idea.
