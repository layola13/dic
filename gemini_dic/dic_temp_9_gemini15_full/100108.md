interpretability: /ˌɪntɜːˌprɛtəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可解释性 | The degree to which a system's decisions or predictions can be understood by humans.  It refers to the ability to explain the reasoning behind a system's output.  This is particularly important in fields like machine learning, where opaque models can lead to mistrust and difficulty in debugging. |  The interpretability of this machine learning model is crucial for regulatory compliance.  The high interpretability of the decision tree allowed us to easily understand why the loan application was rejected. | Explainability, transparency, comprehensibility |  Opacity, incomprehensibility, black-box nature


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The interpretability of this model is high. = 这个模型的可解释性很高。
