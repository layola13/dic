词源:

The word "rememberably" is derived from the verb "remember"  + the suffix "-ably," which means "in a manner that is."  Therefore, "rememberably" signifies "in a manner that is worthy of being remembered."  The root of "remember" traces back to Old English "gemyndgian," which combines "ge-" (intensive prefix) and "myndgian" (to be mindful).


用法说明:

Rememberably is an adverb, modifying a verb, adjective, or another adverb to indicate that something is so memorable or significant that it is worth remembering.  It emphasizes the lasting impression of an event or experience.  It is often used to describe experiences that are exceptionally good or bad, highlighting their impact.  While "memorable" is more common, "rememberably" adds a slightly more emphatic tone.
