词源:

The word "over-arousal" is a compound word.  "Over-" is a prefix indicating excess or too much. "Arousal" comes from the verb "arouse," meaning to awaken or excite.  The root of "arouse" can be traced back to Old French "areuser" and ultimately to Latin "ad" (to) + "rogare" (to ask, to call).  Therefore, "over-arousal" literally means "excessive awakening or excitation."
