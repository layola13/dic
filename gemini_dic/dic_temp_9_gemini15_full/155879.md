photoabsorbing: /ˌfoʊtoʊəbˈzɔːrbɪŋ/ | adj. | 光吸收的 | Able to absorb light.  This term describes materials or processes that absorb light energy.  The absorption can be across a range of wavelengths, or it may be selective, absorbing only certain wavelengths and reflecting or transmitting others.  The absorbed light energy can be converted into other forms of energy, such as heat or electricity. |  The photoabsorbing dye in the fabric prevents the sun from damaging the fibers.  光吸收染料防止阳光损坏纤维。 |  light-absorbing, photosensitive  |  light-reflecting, light-transmitting |  形容词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The material is photoabsorbing. =  这种材料具有光吸收性。
This process photoabsorbs ultraviolet light. = 这个过程吸收紫外线。


一般过去时:
The solution photoabsorbed the light efficiently. = 该溶液有效地吸收了光线。
The experiment showed that the sample photoabsorbed strongly in the blue region. = 实验表明，样品在蓝色区域强烈吸收光线。


现在完成时:
The dye has photoabsorbed most of the visible light. = 染料已经吸收了大部分可见光。
Scientists have developed new photoabsorbing materials for solar cells. = 科学家们已经开发出用于太阳能电池的新型光吸收材料。


过去完成时:
The plant had photoabsorbed enough sunlight for the day before the storm hit. = 在暴风雨来临之前，植物已经吸收了足够的阳光。
The experiment had shown that the material photoabsorbed more light at lower temperatures. = 实验表明，该材料在较低温度下吸收更多光线。


将来时:
The new coating will photoabsorb a wider range of wavelengths. = 新涂层将吸收更宽范围的波长。
We expect the device to photoabsorb efficiently under these conditions. = 我们预计该设备在这种条件下会有效地吸收光线。


虚拟语气:
If the material were more photoabsorbing, it would be more effective. = 如果材料的光吸收性更强，它就会更有效。
I wish the coating photoabsorbed more infrared light. = 我希望涂层能够吸收更多红外光。


被动语态:
The light was photoabsorbed by the pigment. = 光线被色素吸收了。
Most of the incident light is photoabsorbed by the sample. = 大部分入射光被样品吸收了。


疑问句:
Does this material photoabsorb effectively at high temperatures? = 这种材料在高温下是否有效地吸收光线？
How much light is photoabsorbed by this process? = 这个过程吸收了多少光？


否定句:
The material does not photoabsorb ultraviolet light. = 该材料不吸收紫外线。
The sample did not photoabsorb as much light as expected. = 样品吸收的光线没有预期那么多。


PHRASE->
photoabsorbing properties = 光吸收特性
highly photoabsorbing = 高度光吸收的
photoabsorbing layer = 光吸收层
photoabsorbing material = 光吸收材料
photoabsorbing capacity = 光吸收能力
