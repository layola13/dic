galvanic:/ɡælˈvænɪk/| adj.| 电镀的；电流的；由电流产生的 | Relating to or produced by electric current, especially a direct current.  It often refers to the effects of electric current on living tissue or the production of electric current by chemical means. | 例句：The experiment demonstrated a galvanic effect.  这个实验展示了一种电化效应。

The process used a galvanic current to plate the metal. 这个过程用电流来电镀金属。


近义词：electrolytic, voltaic | 反义词：None truly antonymous, but words implying absence of electrical current could be considered contextual opposites.


词源:From Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), an Italian physician and physicist known for his experiments on animal electricity, which led to the discovery of galvanism.  The term is derived from his name.
