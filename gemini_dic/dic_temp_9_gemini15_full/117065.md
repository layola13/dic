词源:

The term "me-time" is a relatively recent addition to the English language, emerging in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.  It's a compound noun formed by combining the possessive pronoun "me" with the noun "time," reflecting the self-focused nature of the activity.  Its rise in popularity is linked to the increasing awareness of the importance of self-care and stress management in modern life.  There is no specific etymological root beyond its straightforward compositional nature.
