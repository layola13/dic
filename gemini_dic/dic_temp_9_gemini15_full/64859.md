词源:
The word "espouse" comes from the Old French word "espouser," meaning "to marry," which in turn comes from the Latin word "sponsare," meaning "to promise, to betroth."  The sense of "to support or advocate" developed later, likely stemming from the idea of a marriage being a commitment and a public declaration of support.
