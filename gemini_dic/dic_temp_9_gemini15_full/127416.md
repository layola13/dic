词源:

The word "neat" originates from Old English *nēat, meaning "cattle,"  particularly "horned cattle." This sense is now largely obsolete.  The modern meaning of "clean, tidy" developed later, possibly through an association with the idea of well-kept livestock and their surroundings.  The sense of "skillful, clever" is a later development, connected to the idea of something being done efficiently and precisely, like a well-managed herd.
