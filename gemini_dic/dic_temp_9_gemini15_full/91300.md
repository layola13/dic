hydromechanics:/ˌhaɪdroʊməˈkænɪks/| n. |水力学|The branch of mechanics dealing with the motion and equilibrium of liquids and the interaction between liquids and solids or gases.  It encompasses fluid statics (the study of fluids at rest), fluid dynamics (the study of fluids in motion), and hydraulics (the application of fluid mechanics principles to engineering systems).|Example:  The principles of hydromechanics are essential in designing efficient water turbines.|近义词：fluid mechanics|反义词：无
