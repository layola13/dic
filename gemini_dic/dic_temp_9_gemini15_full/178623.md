词源:
The word "recoverable" derives from the verb "recover," which comes from the Old French word "recuvrer," meaning "to regain, recover."  "Recuvrer" itself is composed of the prefix "re-" (again) and "cuvrer" (to cover, to find).  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or possibility.  Therefore, "recoverable" literally means "capable of being recovered."
