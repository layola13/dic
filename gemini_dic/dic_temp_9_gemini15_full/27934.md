cantilevers:/ˈkæntilˌiːvər/| n.|悬臂，悬臂梁|A cantilever is a rigid structural element, such as a beam or a slab, that extends horizontally and is supported only at one end.  It is used in various structures and engineering applications. |例句：The bridge's design incorporates several impressive cantilevers. 这座桥的设计包含几个令人印象深刻的悬臂梁。

例句：The architect used cantilevers to create a dramatic overhanging roof. 建筑师利用悬臂梁创造了一个引人注目的悬挑屋顶。


近义词：overhang, projection|反义词：支撑梁(a beam supported at both ends)


词源:  From Medieval Latin *cantilever, from Old French *cantilever, perhaps from Late Latin *cantilis "beam," + *lever "to raise," ultimately of Germanic origin.
