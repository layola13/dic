The word "{changdu}" is not an English word.  It appears to be a transliteration of a word from another language, likely Chinese, meaning "length".  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, etymology, or usage examples in the requested format for a non-existent English word.  To help you, I need the correct English word.  If you meant "length," I can provide the requested information.
