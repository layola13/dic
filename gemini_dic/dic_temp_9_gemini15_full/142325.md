orthodromics:/ˌɔːrθəˈdrɒmɪks/| n. |正射航线学；大圆航线；最短航线|The study of the shortest distance between two points on a sphere, typically used in navigation.  It involves calculating great-circle routes.  |Example:  Orthodromics is crucial for long-distance air and sea navigation to minimize travel time and fuel consumption.|近义词：great-circle sailing, great-circle navigation|反义词：loxodromic navigation (rhumb line navigation)|名词
