The word "etherin" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible this is:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), it might be possible to determine the intended word.
* **A neologism or technical term:** It might be a newly coined word, a term specific to a particular field, or a word from a fictional language.  Again, context is crucial.
* **A proper noun:** It could be a name (person, place, or thing).
