词源:  The word "irrelevant" is formed from the prefix "ir-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "relevant," which comes from the Old French word "relevant" meaning "raising, lifting up; pertinent."  The ultimate Latin root is *relevāre*  "to raise up, lighten."  The sense of "pertinent" developed from the idea of something being "lifted up" or made prominent as important.
