词源:

Derived from "mosaic" + "-ally,"  meaning "in the manner of a mosaic."  "Mosaic" itself originates from the Greek word "musaïkos," meaning "of the Muses," referring to the artistic skill involved in creating mosaics.  The Muses were the goddesses of arts and sciences in Greek mythology.


用法说明:

Mosaically is primarily used as an adverb to describe something that is arranged or designed in a way that resembles a mosaic—a picture or decoration made of small, usually colored pieces of stone, glass, or tile.  It suggests a variety of elements coming together to form a larger, more complex whole.  The elements may be different in color, texture, shape, or other characteristics.
