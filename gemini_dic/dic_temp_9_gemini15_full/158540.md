词源:
The word "plesance" ultimately derives from the Old French word "plesance," meaning "pleasure," "delight," or "pleasantness."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "placere," meaning "to please" or "to be pleasing."  The word's use as a noun signifying a pleasant place, garden, or park developed over time.
