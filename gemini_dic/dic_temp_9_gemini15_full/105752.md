The word "{kirai}" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a word from another language, possibly Japanese.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, detailed etymology, usage examples in English sentences, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis in the requested format.  To help me assist you, please provide the correct English word or clarify the language of origin.
