The word "preworships" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need to understand the intended meaning or correct spelling.  Is it a possible misspelling of a known word, or a deliberately created word with a specific meaning within a particular context?  Please clarify.
