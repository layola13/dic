The word "lambskinnet" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very niche context (e.g., a dialect, a specific brand name).  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide analysis, I need a valid English word.
