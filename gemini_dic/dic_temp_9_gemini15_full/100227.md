词源：

The word "interrogatorily" derives from the verb "interrogate," which itself comes from the Late Latin word "interrogare," meaning "to ask questions."  "Interrogare" is a combination of the prefix "inter-" (between, among) and "rogare" (to ask). The suffix "-ily" transforms the adjective "interrogatory" into an adverb.


用法说明:

It implies a questioning, suspicious, or challenging manner, often associated with an interrogation or a situation requiring clarification.  It suggests a tone or look that implies doubt or the seeking of information, often in a formal or official context.  It does not necessarily imply hostility, but it does suggest a level of scrutiny.
