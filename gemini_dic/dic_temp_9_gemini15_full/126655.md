The word "nakeder" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in any major dictionary.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  If it was intended to be a comparative form of "naked," the correct spelling would be "naker."  However, "naker" itself is also not a standard English word.  The comparative form of "naked" is usually expressed using "more naked" or phrases like "less clothed."

Therefore, a detailed analysis following the requested format is impossible because the word does not exist in a way that allows for such an analysis.
