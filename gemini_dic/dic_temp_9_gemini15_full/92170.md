The word is a combination of:

* **hyper-:**  A prefix meaning "excessive," "over," or "beyond."
* **sophistication:**  Meaning "the quality of being sophisticated," which itself derives from "sophisticated," meaning "refined and cultured," ultimately from the word "sophist," a wise person who teaches rhetoric and logic.


The word "hypersophistication" is a relatively modern coinage, reflecting the increasing complexity of systems and technologies in the latter half of the 20th and early 21st centuries.
