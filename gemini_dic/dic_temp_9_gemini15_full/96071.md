词源：

* **decorous:**  From Latin *decorus* meaning "becoming, proper, seemly."  This adjective describes behavior that is proper and polite.

* **indecorous:** The prefix "in-" negates the meaning of "decorous," creating the adjective "indecorous," meaning "not proper or polite."

* **indecorousnesses:** This is the plural noun form of "indecorous," indicating multiple instances of improper or impolite behavior.  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective into a noun, and the "-es" indicates plurality.
