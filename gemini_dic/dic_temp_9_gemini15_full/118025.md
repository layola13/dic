词源:
The name "Memphis" derives from the ancient Egyptian city of Men-nofer ("the good abode"), the capital of ancient Egypt during the Old Kingdom.  The name was chosen by the French explorer and founder of Fort Prudhomme (later Memphis), who had likely studied ancient history.  The modern city's name thus reflects a historical connection, albeit a geographically distant one, to a significant ancient civilization.
