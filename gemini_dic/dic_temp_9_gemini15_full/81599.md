词源:
The word "greatcoated" is derived from "greatcoat," which itself combines "great" (meaning large or substantial) and "coat."  The suffix "-ed" transforms the noun "greatcoat" into a participle adjective, describing something or someone wearing a greatcoat.  The term "greatcoat" emerged in the 17th century, referring to a long, heavy overcoat.
