词源:

The word "genteelness" derives from the Old French word "gentil," meaning "noble," "well-born," or "of good family."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "gentilis," having the same meaning. Over time, "gentil" evolved in English to "gentle," and subsequently to "genteel," which initially described someone of noble birth but later broadened to encompass refined manners and behavior regardless of social standing.  The suffix "-ness" simply adds the quality of being.
