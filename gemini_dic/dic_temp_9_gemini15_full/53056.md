dioptres:/ˈdaɪɒptərz/| n. |屈光度，度数|A dioptre (plural dioptres) is a unit of measurement of the refractive power of a lens or curved mirror. It is equal to the reciprocal of the focal length measured in metres.  A higher dioptre number indicates a stronger refractive power. For example, a +2.00 dioptre lens converges light more strongly than a +1.00 dioptre lens. |The optician prescribed glasses with a +2.00 dioptre lens for her farsightedness.|近义词：refractive power|反义词：N/A
