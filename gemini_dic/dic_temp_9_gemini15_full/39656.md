词源:
The word "conservatively" derives from the adjective "conservative," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "conservare," meaning "to preserve" or "to keep safe."  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner in which something is done.  Therefore, "conservatively" signifies acting in a way that emphasizes preservation, caution, and avoidance of risk.
