词源:  The word "limitlessness" is derived from the word "limit," which comes from the Old French word "limite," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "limes," meaning "boundary" or "border."  The suffix "-less" indicates the absence of something, and "-ness" turns an adjective into a noun, creating the noun "limitlessness" signifying the absence of limits.
