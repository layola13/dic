词源:  The word "disoriented" is derived from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the word "oriented."  "Oriented" comes from the Latin word "oriens," meaning "east" (referring to the rising sun, a common point of reference for direction).  Therefore, "disoriented" literally means "not oriented" or "lacking orientation."
