The word "formos" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  It's possible you have encountered a misspelling, a proper noun (like a place name), or a word from another language.  To provide an analysis, I need more context.  Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing its origin and context would allow for a proper explanation.
