The word "goet" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical paradigms as requested.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A proper noun:**  It might be a name (person, place, or thing) not widely known.
* **A word from another language:**  It might be a word from a different language that hasn't been integrated into English.
* **A neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or a word used within a specific community.

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you can.  With more information, I can help you.
