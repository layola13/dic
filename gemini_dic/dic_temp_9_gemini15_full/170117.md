protocercal:/ˌproʊtoʊˈsɜːrkəl/ | adj. | 原尾型的；前尾型的 |  Referring to a type of tail fin in which the vertebral column extends to the tip of the tail, and the fin is symmetrical around it. This is the ancestral condition in vertebrates, though it is rarely seen in adult forms. | Example: "The larval stage of this fish exhibits a protocercal tail." = “这种鱼的幼体阶段具有原尾型尾鳍。” | 近义词: (lacks direct synonyms,  but describes a feature contrasting with other tail types) | 反义词: heterocercal, homocercal


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in zoology and comparative anatomy, and therefore its usage in different grammatical tenses is less common than other words.  We will illustrate with examples related to its scientific context.

一般现在时:
The acipenser exhibits a protocercal tail in its larval stage. = 鲟鱼在幼体阶段具有原尾型尾鳍。
This species retains a protocercal tail throughout its life cycle. = 这个物种在其整个生命周期中都保留着原尾型尾鳍。


一般过去时:
Paleontologists observed a protocercal tail in the fossilized remains. = 古生物学家在化石遗骸中观察到原尾型尾鳍。
The researchers documented the protocercal tail structure in their report. = 研究人员在报告中记录了原尾型尾鳍的结构。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several species with protocercal tails. = 科学家已经鉴定出几种具有原尾型尾鳍的物种。
Studies have shown the evolutionary significance of the protocercal tail. = 研究表明原尾型尾鳍的进化意义。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, it was believed that all species had lost the protocercal tail. = 在发现之前，人们认为所有物种都失去了原尾型尾鳍。
They had already observed similar protocercal structures in related species. = 他们已经在相关物种中观察到类似的原尾型结构。


将来时:
Future research will likely explore the development of the protocercal tail further. = 未来的研究可能会进一步探索原尾型尾鳍的发育。
We will examine the protocercal tail's morphology in detail. = 我们将详细检查原尾型尾鳍的形态。


虚拟语气:
If the fossil had a protocercal tail, it would support our hypothesis. = 如果化石具有原尾型尾鳍，那将支持我们的假设。
It is unlikely that the adult form would retain a protocercal tail if it were a bony fish. = 如果是硬骨鱼，成体形式不太可能保留原尾型尾鳍。


被动语态:
The protocercal tail was observed in the early embryonic stages. = 在早期胚胎阶段观察到原尾型尾鳍。
The evolutionary origins of the protocercal tail are being studied extensively. = 原尾型尾鳍的进化起源正在被广泛研究。


疑问句:
Does this species possess a protocercal tail? = 这个物种是否拥有原尾型尾鳍？
What are the developmental processes involved in protocercal tail formation? = 原尾型尾鳍形成涉及哪些发育过程？


否定句:
This specimen does not exhibit a protocercal tail. = 这个标本没有表现出原尾型尾鳍。
The adult form does not retain the protocercal tail. = 成体形式没有保留原尾型尾鳍。


PHRASE->
There are limited common phrases directly using "protocercal," as it's a highly specialized term.  Phrases would be constructed around it within a scientific context. Examples could be:
"protocercal tail development," "evolution of the protocercal tail,"  "protocercal tail morphology," "ancestral protocercal condition," "phylogeny of protocercal tails"
