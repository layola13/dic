词源:
The word "oversatieties" is a relatively modern coinage, combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessive") with "satieties" (the plural of "satiety," meaning a feeling of being completely satisfied).  "Satiety" itself comes from the Latin word "satietas," which is derived from "satis" ("enough").  Therefore, "oversatieties" literally means "excessive states of being satisfied," which in a market context implies an excess of supply or an overwhelming abundance.
