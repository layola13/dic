词源:
The word "reclaimant" is derived from the verb "reclaim," which comes from the Old French "reclamer," meaning "to call back," "to demand back," or "to cry out."  The suffix "-ant" is a noun suffix that forms agents or participants of an action.  Therefore, a "reclaimant" is someone who is actively "reclaiming" something.
