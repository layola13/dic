The word "nonpresentableness" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), "presentable" (meaning capable of being presented or shown), and the suffix "-ness" (meaning "the state or quality of").  "Presentable" itself derives from the verb "present," ultimately tracing back to the Latin word "praesentare," meaning "to present, to offer."
