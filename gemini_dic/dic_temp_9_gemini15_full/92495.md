hypotenuse:/haɪˈpɒtənjuːs/| n. |斜边 |The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right-angled triangle, opposite the right angle. It is the side opposite to the right angle in a right-angled triangle.  |Example:  In a right-angled triangle with sides of length 3 and 4, the hypotenuse has a length of 5.  在一个三边长分别为3和4的直角三角形中，斜边的长度为5。|近义词：longest side (of a right-angled triangle)|反义词：leg (of a right-angled triangle)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The hypotenuse is the longest side. = 斜边是最长的一边。
What is the length of the hypotenuse? = 斜边的长度是多少？


一般过去时:
We calculated the hypotenuse yesterday. = 我们昨天计算了斜边。
The hypotenuse was longer than I expected. = 斜边比我预期的要长。


现在完成时:
We have found the length of the hypotenuse. = 我们已经找到了斜边的长度。
Have you calculated the hypotenuse yet? = 你计算出斜边了吗？


过去完成时:
They had already determined the hypotenuse before the presentation. = 他们在演示之前就已经确定了斜边。
I had not understood the concept of the hypotenuse before the lesson. = 在上课之前，我还不理解斜边的概念。


将来时:
We will calculate the hypotenuse tomorrow. = 我们明天将计算斜边。
Will the hypotenuse be longer than 10? = 斜边会超过10吗？


虚拟语气:
If the triangle were a right-angled triangle, we could easily calculate the hypotenuse. = 如果这个三角形是直角三角形，我们可以很容易地计算出斜边。
I wish I had known the formula for calculating the hypotenuse earlier. = 我真希望我早点知道计算斜边的公式。


被动语态:
The hypotenuse was calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. = 斜边是使用勾股定理计算出来的。
The length of the hypotenuse is being measured. = 正在测量斜边的长度。


疑问句:
What is the hypotenuse? = 什么是斜边？
How long is the hypotenuse? = 斜边有多长？


否定句:
The hypotenuse is not the shortest side. = 斜边不是最短的一边。
We did not calculate the hypotenuse correctly. = 我们没有正确地计算出斜边。


PHRASE->
length of the hypotenuse = 斜边的长度
calculate the hypotenuse = 计算斜边
find the hypotenuse = 求斜边
Pythagorean theorem and hypotenuse = 勾股定理和斜边
hypotenuse of a right triangle = 直角三角形的斜边
