/nɒnˈpɒlətɪkɪŋz/ | n. | 非政治性活动；避免政治的言行 |  The word "nonpolitickings" is not a standard English word. It's a nonce word, likely created by combining "non-" (meaning "not") with a form of "politick" (to engage in politics) and adding "-ings" to create a noun form suggesting activities or actions.

It implies actions or behaviors that deliberately avoid politics or political involvement. | Example:  The community meeting focused on nonpolitickings, concentrating on local issues like road repairs and park improvements instead of national politics.  |近义词: apolitical actions, non-political activities, avoidance of politics | 反义词: political maneuvering, partisan activities |  词性: noun
