capitalnesses:/ˈkæpɪtəlˌnɛsɪz/| n. | 首都性；资本性；重要性 (复数)|The word "capitalnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a non-standard plural form of "capitalness," which itself is rarely used.  It would imply multiple instances of the qualities associated with capitals (e.g., importance, being a seat of government, financial significance).  The usage is highly unusual and should be avoided in formal writing. |  There are no standard examples of its usage because it's not a legitimate word. One could *hypothetically* construct a sentence like: "The various capitalnesses of the different city-states were debated at length." However, this sentence is awkward and unnatural. | 近义词:importances, significances | 反义词:unimportances (though this is also not a standard word) | noun
