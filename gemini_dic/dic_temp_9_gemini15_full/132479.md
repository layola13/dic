/ˌnɒnˌdɛrəˈɡeɪtərilinɪsɪz/| n. |非贬义性；非贬损性；不贬低的行为或状态 |The word "nonderogatorilynesses" is not a standard English word. It is a highly unusual and artificial formation, likely created by combining "non-derogatory" (not diminishing or belittling) with the suffix "-ness" (indicating a state or quality) and adding another "-ness" to create a plural or intensified form.  There is no established meaning or usage for this word in dictionaries or common language.  It's grammatically incorrect to use the suffix "-ness" twice to create a plural. To express the idea, one would use "instances of non-derogatory behavior" or similar phrasing. | Example:  (This word should not be used in this context as it’s not a real word)  The judge's rulings were characterized by a series of nonderogatorilynesses. (This sentence is grammatically incorrect and should be replaced with something like: The judge's rulings were consistently non-derogatory.)|近义词: instances of non-derogatory behavior, instances of respect, expressions of politeness|反义词: instances of derogatory behavior, insults, disparagements|名词
