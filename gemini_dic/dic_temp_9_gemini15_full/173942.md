词源:

The word "quasi-secure" is a combination of "quasi-" and "secure."  "Quasi-" is a Latin prefix meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent." "Secure" comes from the Old French "secur," meaning "free from care or fear," ultimately from the Latin "securus."  Therefore, "quasi-secure" literally means "seemingly secure" or "partially secure."
