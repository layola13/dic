The term "hack's" is derived from the noun "hack," which itself has a complex etymology.  "Hack" originally meant to cut or chop roughly, evolving to mean to manage clumsily or improvise.  In the context of computing, "hack" took on a new meaning, referring to clever programming or problem-solving, often using unconventional methods.  This sense then broadened to encompass malicious activities by hackers.  Adding the possessive apostrophe 's' creates "hack's," specifying ownership or association.


近义词:  hacker's, programmer's (in certain contexts),  cracker's (in a malicious context)

反义词:  None directly applicable; the antonym would depend on the specific context of "hack's" usage.  For example, if "hack's solution" refers to a clumsy fix, a contrasting phrase might be "expert's solution."
