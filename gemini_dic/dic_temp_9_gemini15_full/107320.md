lambdas:/ˈlæmbdəz/| n. |λ表达式，匿名函数|Lambda expressions are anonymous functions, often used in functional programming to define short, self-contained pieces of code. They're particularly useful for concisely expressing operations that need to be applied to collections of data.  They are characterized by their lack of a formal name, unlike named functions.  The term "lambda" comes from lambda calculus, a formal system of computation based on function abstraction.|

Example 1:  In Python, a lambda function to add two numbers: `lambda x, y: x + y`  =  Python中，一个用于加两个数字的lambda函数。

Example 2: In JavaScript, a lambda function to square a number: `x => x * x` = JavaScript中，一个用于平方数字的lambda函数。
