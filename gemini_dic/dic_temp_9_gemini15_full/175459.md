The word "rammishness" derives from the Middle English word "ram," meaning a male sheep, and by extension, implies forceful, aggressive, and sometimes sexually suggestive behavior. The suffix "-ishness" adds the quality or characteristic of being like a ram.  The association likely stems from the aggressive nature of rams during mating season.
