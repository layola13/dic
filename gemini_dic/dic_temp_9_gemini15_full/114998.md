词源:  The word "mandarining" is derived from "mandarin," referring to a type of orange, which in turn originates from the Portuguese word "mandarim," likely borrowed from a Chinese term ( possibly related to the  Mandarin officials who might have been associated with the cultivation or trade of these oranges). The "-ing" suffix denotes the act or process of doing something.
