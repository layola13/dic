词源:

* **ir-**:  prefix meaning "not" or "without"
* **relapse**:  verb meaning "to fall back into a former state, typically a worse one" (from Latin *re-*, "again" + *lapsus*, "a fall, slip")
* **-able**: suffix forming adjectives meaning "capable of being" or "worthy of being"


用法说明:

Irrelapsable is primarily used to describe situations or conditions that are impossible to undo or reverse.  It emphasizes the finality and permanence of a situation, often in a negative context.  It is not commonly used in everyday conversation but rather in more formal writing or situations where precision of language is important.  The word carries a strong sense of hopelessness or inevitability.
