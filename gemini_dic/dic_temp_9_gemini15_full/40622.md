词源:  The word "conveniently" derives from the adjective "convenient," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "convenient," meaning "suitable," "fitting," or "appropriate."  This, in turn, is derived from the Latin word "conveniens," the present participle of "convenire," meaning "to come together," "to agree," or "to be suitable."  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating manner or way.


用法说明:

Conveniently is an adverb that modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb, describing how an action or state is performed or exists. It emphasizes the ease and suitability of something.  It can sometimes have a slightly negative connotation, suggesting that something was done in a way that was too easy or advantageous for the person involved, implying a degree of manipulation or deception.
