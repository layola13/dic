idiomuscular:/ˌɪdiəʊˈmʌskjʊlə(r)/| adj.|肌内的；肌自身的；肌特有的|Relating to or affecting a single muscle or muscle fiber.  The term often describes a phenomenon or response confined within a muscle itself, rather than involving the nervous system or other muscles.|The idiomuscular contraction was easily elicited by tapping the muscle directly. 肌内收缩很容易通过直接敲击肌肉引起。|近义词：intrinsic (in relation to muscle function)|反义词：extrinsic (in relation to muscle function)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The idiomuscular response is clearly visible. = 肌内反应清晰可见。
Idiomuscular contraction is studied in physiology. = 肌内收缩在生理学中被研究。


一般过去时:
The doctor observed the idiomuscular reaction. = 医生观察了肌内反应。
The experiment demonstrated idiomuscular excitability. = 实验展示了肌内兴奋性。


现在完成时:
Researchers have documented many cases of idiomuscular phenomena. = 研究人员已经记录了许多肌内现象的案例。
Scientists have investigated the mechanisms of idiomuscular contractions. = 科学家们已经研究了肌内收缩的机制。


过去完成时:
They had already understood the idiomuscular response before the experiment. = 他们在实验之前就已经理解了肌内反应。
The researchers had observed this idiomuscular phenomenon in previous studies. = 研究人员在之前的研究中已经观察到这种肌内现象。


将来时:
We will analyze the idiomuscular activity of the muscle. = 我们将分析肌肉的肌内活动。
Future studies will further explore idiomuscular contractions. = 未来的研究将进一步探索肌内收缩。


虚拟语气:
If the muscle were completely relaxed, the idiomuscular response would be minimal. = 如果肌肉完全放松，肌内反应将最小。
If I had known about idiomuscular contraction earlier, I would have approached the experiment differently. = 如果我早知道肌内收缩，我会采取不同的实验方法。


被动语态:
The idiomuscular response was carefully measured. = 肌内反应被仔细测量。
Idiomuscular contractions are often studied using electromyography. = 肌内收缩通常使用肌电图来研究。


疑问句:
Is this an idiomuscular contraction? = 这是肌内收缩吗？
What causes this idiomuscular response? = 什么导致了这种肌内反应？


否定句:
This is not an idiomuscular response; it's neurological. = 这不是肌内反应；它是神经性的。
The patient did not exhibit any signs of idiomuscular excitability. = 病人没有表现出任何肌内兴奋性的迹象。


PHRASE->
