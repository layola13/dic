USAGE->

Therefore, providing examples of tenses, moods, and voices is not applicable.  The word itself functions as a noun, and usage would be limited to descriptive sentences within the field of entomology.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "pantastomata".  The term is highly specialized.
