nonrotations:/ˌnɒnˌroʊˈteɪʃənz/ | n. |非旋转，无旋转 |The term "nonrotations" refers to instances or situations where rotation does not occur.  It's primarily used in scientific and technical contexts, particularly where rotation is an expected or typical phenomenon.  For example, in astronomy, it might refer to celestial bodies that do not rotate, or in engineering, to parts of a machine designed to remain stationary. |例句：The study of planetary nonrotations revealed some unexpected findings about the early solar system. 这项关于行星非旋转的研究揭示了关于早期太阳系的一些意外发现。


The analysis of the engine's nonrotations indicated a design flaw. 对发动机非旋转的分析表明存在设计缺陷。|近义词：lack of rotation, stillness, immobility |反义词：rotations, spins, revolutions


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't conjugate like verbs. Therefore, standard verb tenses are not applicable.  Its usage is descriptive, focusing on the absence of rotation.  The grammatical structures would revolve around how "nonrotations" are described, quantified, or contrasted.


Example sentence structures:


Simple present: The instrument detected several periods of nonrotation. 仪器探测到几个非旋转周期。

Simple past:  The experiment showed a significant increase in nonrotations after the modification. 实验表明，修改后非旋转现象显著增加。

With modifiers:  Unexpected nonrotations were observed in the data set. 在数据集中观察到意外的非旋转现象。

Comparative: The new design reduced nonrotations compared to the previous version. 与之前的版本相比，新设计减少了非旋转现象。


PHRASE->

"periods of nonrotation" (非旋转周期)
"instances of nonrotation" (非旋转实例)
"analysis of nonrotations" (对非旋转现象的分析)
"causes of nonrotation" (非旋转的原因)
"effects of nonrotation" (非旋转的影响)
