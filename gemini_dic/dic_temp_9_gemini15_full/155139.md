词源:  The word comes from "pettifogger," a now-archaic term for a petty lawyer who deals with minor legal matters in a trivial or unscrupulous way.  "Petty" means small or insignificant, and "fog" here refers to obscuring or confusing something.  Thus, a pettifogger fogs things up with trivial details.  The "-ing" suffix transforms it into an adjective.
