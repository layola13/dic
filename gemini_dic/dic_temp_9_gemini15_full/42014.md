词源:
The word "costermonger" itself comes from "coster" (a contraction of "costard-monger") + "monger" (meaning "trader" or "dealer").  "Costard" referred to a type of apple, suggesting that costermongers originally dealt largely in fruit. Over time, it broadened to encompass any street vendor selling a variety of goods.  Therefore, "costermongery" is a noun derived from "costermonger," describing the activities of such vendors.
