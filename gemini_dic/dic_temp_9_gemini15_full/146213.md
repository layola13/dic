词源:  The word "overexpended" is formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the past participle of the verb "expend" (meaning "to use up or spend").  "Expend" itself comes from the Latin word "expendere," which is a combination of "ex-" (out) and "pendere" (to weigh or hang).  Thus, the word's root implies the spending of something completely.
