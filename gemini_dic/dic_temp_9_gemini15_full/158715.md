词源:
The word "ploughman" is a compound word. It is formed by combining "plough" (a tool used for tilling land) and "man" (a male person).  The word "plough" itself has Old English roots, tracing back to Proto-Germanic and ultimately to Proto-Indo-European roots related to the act of digging or turning over soil.
