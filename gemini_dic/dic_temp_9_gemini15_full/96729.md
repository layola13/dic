词源:
The word "inefficiently" is formed by adding the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") to "efficiently," which is the adverbial form of the adjective "efficient."  "Efficient" itself comes from the Latin "efficiens," the present participle of "efficere," meaning "to effect" or "to bring about."  Therefore, "inefficiently" literally means "not bringing about results with maximum effectiveness."
