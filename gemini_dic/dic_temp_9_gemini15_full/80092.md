goaves:/ɡoʊvz/| n.|采矿巷道，矿井巷道 |Underground passages or tunnels in a mine.  Goaves are often created by removing ore or coal.|例句：The miners carefully mapped the goaves to avoid collapsing tunnels. 矿工们仔细绘制了采矿巷道的图，以避免隧道坍塌。 The old goaves were unstable and posed a significant risk. 旧的采矿巷道不稳定，构成了重大风险。|近义词：mine workings, tunnels, galleries |反义词：surface, open pit


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The goaves remain a hazard in abandoned mines. = 废弃矿井中的采矿巷道仍然构成危险。
Miners carefully inspect the goaves for instability. = 矿工们仔细检查采矿巷道是否不稳定。

一般过去时:
The goaves were filled with water after the mine flooded. = 矿井被淹后，采矿巷道被水淹没了。
They surveyed the goaves to assess the damage. = 他们勘测了采矿巷道以评估损失。

现在完成时:
The company has filled many goaves with inert materials. = 公司已经用惰性材料填充了许多采矿巷道。
The government has invested in goave stabilization projects. = 政府已投资于采矿巷道稳定项目。

过去完成时:
The mine had collapsed because the goaves were unsupported. = 由于采矿巷道没有支撑，矿井坍塌了。
They had already explored most of the goaves before the accident. = 事故发生前，他们已经探索了大部分采矿巷道。

将来时:
They will reinforce the goaves to prevent future collapses. = 他们将加固采矿巷道以防止未来坍塌。
The engineers will map the goaves using advanced technology. = 工程师们将利用先进技术绘制采矿巷道的图。

虚拟语气:
If the goaves were properly supported, the mine would be safer. = 如果采矿巷道得到适当的支撑，矿井就会更安全。
I wish the goaves had been filled before the flood. = 我希望洪水来临之前采矿巷道已经被填满。

被动语态:
The goaves were mapped extensively before the mining operation began. = 采矿作业开始前，采矿巷道被广泛勘测。
The goaves are being monitored for signs of instability. = 正在监测采矿巷道是否有不稳定迹象。

疑问句:
Are the goaves stable enough for safe passage? = 采矿巷道足够稳定，可以安全通行吗？
How many goaves are there in this abandoned mine? = 这个废弃矿井有多少采矿巷道？

否定句:
The goaves were not properly inspected before the accident. = 事故发生前，采矿巷道没有得到适当的检查。
The miners did not enter the unstable goaves. = 矿工们没有进入不稳定的采矿巷道。


PHRASE->
goave collapse = 采矿巷道坍塌
mapping goaves = 绘制采矿巷道图
goave stability = 采矿巷道稳定性
fill goaves = 填充采矿巷道
inspect goaves = 检查采矿巷道
