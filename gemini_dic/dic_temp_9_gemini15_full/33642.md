词源:  The word "cinema" comes from the French word "cinéma," which itself is a shortening of "cinématographe," a term coined in 1897 by the Lumière brothers, pioneers of early cinema.  "Cinématographe" is a combination of "ciné," from "cinétique" (kinetic, relating to motion), and "graphe," from "graphein" (to write).  Therefore, "cinématographe" literally means "motion picture writer" or "motion picture apparatus".  The word subsequently entered English, shedding the longer form and retaining the shorter, more elegant "cinema".
