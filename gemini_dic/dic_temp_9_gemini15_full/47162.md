The word "dawish" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, parts of speech, meaning, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical examples as requested.  It might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
2. **A neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.  If this is the case, please provide more context about where you encountered this word.
3. **A proper noun:**  It might be a name or place name.  Again, more context is needed.


To help me assist you, please provide:

* **The source where you found this word:**  This will help determine if it's a misspelling, slang, or a proper noun.
* **The context in which it was used:**  The surrounding sentence or paragraph will give clues to its meaning.


Once I have this information, I can attempt to provide a more accurate response.
