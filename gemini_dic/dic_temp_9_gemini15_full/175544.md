词源:

The word "rancid" ultimately derives from the Latin word "rancidus," meaning "rank," "strong-smelling," or "having a disagreeable odor."  This term itself may be related to the Latin word "rancus," meaning "strong" or "pungent."  The transition from Latin to modern English involved several stages of linguistic evolution.
