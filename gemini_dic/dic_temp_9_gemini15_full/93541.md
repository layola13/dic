imaginary numbers:/ɪˈmædʒɪnəri ˈnʌmbərz/ | n. |虚数 |Imaginary numbers are numbers that, when squared, give a negative result.  They are represented by the letter 'i', where i² = -1.  This is in contrast to real numbers, which when squared always give a positive result (or zero).  Imaginary numbers are fundamental in various branches of mathematics, physics, and engineering. |Example: The square root of -9 is 3i, where 'i' represents the imaginary unit.  √-9 = 3i.   The equation x² + 1 = 0 has solutions x = i and x = -i. |近义词:complex numbers(when combined with real numbers) |反义词:real numbers
