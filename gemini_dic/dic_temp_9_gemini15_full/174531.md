词源：From Middle English quintessence, borrowed from Medieval Latin quinta essentia, literally “fifth essence,” from Latin quintus “fifth” + essentia “essence.”  The term originated in Aristotelian philosophy, referring to a fifth element beyond the four classical elements (earth, air, fire, water).  This fifth element was considered the purest and most perfect substance, the essence of all things. Over time, the meaning shifted to represent the perfect or typical example.
