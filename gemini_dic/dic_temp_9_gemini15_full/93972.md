词源:
The word "impairing" comes from the verb "impair," which comes from the Old French word "empeirer," meaning "to make worse."  This, in turn, has roots in the Latin word "peior," meaning "worse." The prefix "im-" is a negative prefix meaning "not" or "in."  Therefore, "impair" literally means "to make not better," or "to worsen."
