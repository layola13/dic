词源:
The word "kenspeckle" is of Scots origin.  It combines "ken" (meaning "to know" or "to see") and "speckle" (meaning "a small spot or mark").  Therefore, "kenspeckle" literally means "easily seen or known".  It reflects the Scottish dialect's tendency toward vivid and descriptive word formations.
