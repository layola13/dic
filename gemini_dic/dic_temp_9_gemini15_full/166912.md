词源:

The word "prestidigitation" comes from the Late Latin word *praestīgitātiōn-, which is a combination of:

* *praestīgitāre*: to juggle, to deceive with a trick (from *prae* meaning "before" and *stīgitāre* meaning "to prick, to sting")
* *-ātiōn-:  a suffix indicating the action or process.

Therefore,  "prestidigitation" literally means "the act of performing tricks" or "deception through skillful manipulation." The word entered English in the 18th century.
