英文解析:  Forbiddingnesses is the plural form of "forbiddingness," which refers to the quality or state of being forbidding.  Something forbidding is likely to inspire fear, apprehension, or dislike due to its appearance, atmosphere, or inherent characteristics. It suggests something unpleasant, unwelcoming, or even threatening.

词源:

The word derives from the verb "forbid," meaning "to order (someone) not to do something; to prohibit."  Adding the suffix "-ing" creates the present participle, and then adding "-ness" transforms it into a noun signifying the quality or state of being forbidding.  The final "-es" indicates the plural form.  The root ultimately traces back to Old English *forbeodan ("to forbid").
