pseudogenera:/ˌsuːdəʊˈdʒɛnərə/| n. |伪属，假属 |A pseudogenera is a taxonomic rank that is used to group together species that share some, but not all, of the characteristics of a true genus.  These groupings are often artificial and may reflect convergent evolution or other factors that obscure true phylogenetic relationships.  They are typically temporary classifications used until further research clarifies the true relationships between the species. | Example:  In some older classifications, certain groups of organisms were placed into pseudogenera due to a lack of sufficient data to determine their precise phylogenetic position.  |近义词：artificial grouping, provisional genus |反义词：true genus, valid genus |名词
