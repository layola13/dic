词源:
The word "cataclysm" comes from the Greek word "kataklysmos" (κατακλυσμός), which literally means "a deluge," or "a great flood."  This ultimately derives from "kata-" (κατά), meaning "down," and "klyzein" (κλύζειν), meaning "to wash."  The original meaning thus referred specifically to a great flood, often of biblical proportions.  Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass any great destructive event.
