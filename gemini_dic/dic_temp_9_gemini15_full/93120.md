词源:
The origin of "iffy" is uncertain, but it's likely a shortening of "if."  Its use to mean "uncertain" reflects the conditional nature of "if"—something is "iffy" because it depends on uncertain factors.  The word's evolution likely involved a shift from a purely grammatical function to a descriptive adjective.
