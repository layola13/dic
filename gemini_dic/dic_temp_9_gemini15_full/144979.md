词源:

The word "overaccumulating" is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much") with the verb "accumulating" (from the verb "accumulate," meaning "to gather or acquire an increasing quantity of something").  The root of "accumulate" traces back to the Latin word "accumulare," which is a combination of "ad-" (to) and "cumulus" (heap).
