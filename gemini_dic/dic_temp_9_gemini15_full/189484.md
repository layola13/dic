词源:

The word "sake" ultimately derives from the Old English word "sacu," meaning "cause," "dispute," or "matter."  This Old English word is related to other Germanic words with similar meanings. Over time, its meaning shifted, particularly in its adoption into Middle English and then Modern English. The specific evolution to its current uses is complex and involves intermediate meanings. The sense of "purpose" or "account" developed, eventually leading to the modern understanding of "for the sake of."  The Japanese alcoholic beverage, also spelled "sake," is a separate but likely related usage, possibly due to adoption of the word into Japanese.
