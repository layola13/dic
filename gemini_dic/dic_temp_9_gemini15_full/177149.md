词源:
The word "rear-guard" is a compound word.  "Rear" means "at or toward the back," and "guard" means "to protect or defend."  Therefore, "rear-guard" literally means "those who guard the rear."  Its origins are in military terminology, but its usage has expanded to encompass metaphorical meanings.
