词源:
The word "scrooge" derives from the character Ebenezer Scrooge in Charles Dickens's novella *A Christmas Carol* (1843).  While Dickens didn't invent the word, its popular usage stems entirely from the character's association with miserliness and greed.  The word's etymology prior to Dickens's use is unclear and not directly related to its current meaning.
