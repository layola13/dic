词源:
The word "remand" comes from the Old French word "remander," meaning "to send back," which in turn is derived from the prefix "re-" (again) and the verb "mander" (to command, send).  The legal meaning developed over time, reflecting the action of sending a case or person back to a previous stage of the legal process.
