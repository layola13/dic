remanence:/ˈrɛmnəns/| n. |剩余磁性；残留；剩余物|The ability of a material to retain magnetization after the magnetizing field has been removed.  This property is crucial in many applications, including data storage and magnetic sensors.|例句：The remanence of the magnet was surprisingly high, even after being demagnetized.  这块磁铁的剩余磁性非常高，即使在消磁后也是如此。|例句：The old building stood as a remanence of a bygone era. 这座古老的建筑是过去时代的遗迹。|近义词：residue, remnant, vestige|反义词：absence, disappearance


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The magnet retains its remanence. = 磁铁保持着它的剩余磁性。
This material shows high remanence. = 这种材料显示出高剩余磁性。

一般过去时:
The remanence decreased after heating. = 加热后剩余磁性下降了。
The experiment measured the remanence of the sample. = 实验测量了样品的剩余磁性。

现在完成时:
The rock has retained its remanence for millions of years. = 这块岩石已经保持了数百万年的剩余磁性。
Scientists have studied the remanence of ancient artifacts. = 科学家们已经研究了古代文物的剩余磁性。

过去完成时:
The remanence had already diminished before the measurement. = 在测量之前，剩余磁性就已经减弱了。
They had observed a significant remanence in the previous experiment. = 他们在之前的实验中观察到了明显的剩余磁性。

将来时:
The material will exhibit a strong remanence. = 这种材料将表现出强大的剩余磁性。
We will measure the remanence after the magnetization process. = 我们将在磁化过程之后测量剩余磁性。

虚拟语气:
If the material had higher remanence, it would be more useful. = 如果这种材料具有更高的剩余磁性，它将更有用。
I wish the remanence of this magnet were stronger. = 我希望这块磁铁的剩余磁性更强。

被动语态:
The remanence was measured using a magnetometer. = 剩余磁性是使用磁力计测量的。
The sample's remanence is being analyzed. = 样品的剩余磁性正在被分析。

疑问句:
What is the remanence of this magnet? = 这块磁铁的剩余磁性是多少？
Does this material have significant remanence? = 这种材料有明显的剩余磁性吗？

否定句:
The magnet showed no remanence after being heated. = 磁铁加热后没有显示出剩余磁性。
The experiment did not detect any significant remanence. = 实验没有检测到任何明显的剩余磁性。
