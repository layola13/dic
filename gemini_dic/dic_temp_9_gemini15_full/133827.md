The word "nongold" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a full etymological analysis, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a very niche context.

To help, I need more information.  Is "nongold" from a specific book, article, or conversation? Knowing its context might help determine its meaning and possible origins.
