The word "mostick" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a regional dialect word, or slang used within a specific community or context.  If you encountered this word somewhere, providing that context would help determine its meaning.

3. **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name (of a person, place, or thing).

Without more information, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis.  Please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
