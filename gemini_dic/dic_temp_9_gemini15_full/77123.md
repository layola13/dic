gas-cooled:/ˈɡæsˌkuːld/| adj.|气冷的，用气体冷却的|Gas-cooled refers to a system or process where gas is used as a coolant to lower the temperature of something.  This is commonly used in nuclear reactors and some industrial processes.|例句：The reactor is a gas-cooled type.  这个反应堆是气冷式的。|例句：The new power plant uses a gas-cooled system for efficiency. 新发电厂使用气冷系统以提高效率。|近义词：air-cooled (if air is the gas)|反义词：water-cooled, liquid-cooled|形容词
