/ˌpriːdɪˈmɪnɪʃmənts/ | n. | 预先减弱；预先减少 |  The term "prediminishments" refers to the act of weakening or reducing something beforehand. It's not a commonly used word and lacks a standardized definition across various fields.  Its meaning is derived from the combination of "pre-" (before) and "diminishments" (reductions or weakenings).  The specific context in which it's used would determine its precise meaning. For example, in music theory, it might refer to a preparatory lessening of intensity or volume before a main musical phrase. In other contexts, it could describe a preemptive reduction of resources or power.  |  例句：The general's strategy involved prediminishments of the enemy's supply lines before the main attack.  将军的策略是在主要进攻之前削弱敌人的补给线。| 近义词：preemptive reductions, anticipatory weakenings, preliminary diminutions | 反义词：preemptive augmentations, anticipatory intensifications | 名词
