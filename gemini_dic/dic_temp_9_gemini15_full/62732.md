The word "englishback" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specific context (like a slang term or technical jargon) not widely recognized.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  To provide a response, I need more context on where you encountered this word.

If you could provide the source where you saw "englishback," I might be able to offer a better interpretation.  For instance, it could be:

* **A misspelling:**  Is it a misspelling of another word?  Could it be "English back" (referring to something returning to English, or a person returning to England)?  Or perhaps another word entirely?

* **A neologism:** Is it a newly invented word within a specific community or online context?

* **A proper noun:** Is it a brand name, a place name, or a person's name?

Once you provide more context, I can help you understand the meaning and potential usage.
