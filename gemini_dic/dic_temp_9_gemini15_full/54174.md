disepalous: /ˌdaɪˈsepələs/ | adj. | 二萼的 | Having two sepals.  This term is used in botany to describe a flower with two sepals, the outermost whorl of modified leaves enclosing the petals and reproductive organs.  The sepals often protect the flower bud before it opens.

例句：
The flower of this species is disepalous, unlike those of its close relatives. = 这个物种的花是二萼的，不像它的近亲物种。

The disepalous condition is a characteristic feature of this genus. = 二萼性是该属的一个特征。


近义词：bicarpellate (if referring to a structure with two carpels, which is sometimes confused with sepals)


反义词：polysepalous (having many sepals),  monosepalous (having one sepal)


词源:
From "di-" (two) + "sepalous" (having sepals). "Sepal" derives from the Latin "sepalum," a diminutive of "sepes," meaning "hedge" or "fence," reflecting the sepals' protective role.
