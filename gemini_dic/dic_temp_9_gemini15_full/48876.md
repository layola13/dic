diffraction:/dɪˈfrækʃən/| n. |衍射|The spreading out of waves as they pass through an aperture or around an obstacle.|例句：The diffraction of light is responsible for the colours seen in a rainbow. 光的衍射造成了彩虹中看到的颜色。|近义词：bending, scattering, deflection|反义词：N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Diffraction occurs when waves pass through an opening. = 当波穿过开口时会发生衍射。
Light diffracts as it passes through a narrow slit. = 光在通过狭缝时发生衍射。


一般过去时:
The experiment demonstrated the diffraction of X-rays. = 实验演示了X射线的衍射。
Scientists observed diffraction patterns in their research. = 科学家在他们的研究中观察到了衍射图案。


现在完成时:
Researchers have studied diffraction for centuries. = 研究人员已经研究了几个世纪的衍射。
We have observed significant diffraction effects in this material. = 我们在这个材料中观察到了显著的衍射效应。


过去完成时:
They had already analyzed the diffraction data before the presentation. = 他们在演示之前就已经分析了衍射数据。
Scientists had not previously observed this type of diffraction pattern. = 科学家以前从未观察到过这种类型的衍射图案。


将来时:
We will use diffraction techniques to analyze the crystal structure. = 我们将使用衍射技术来分析晶体结构。
The experiment will demonstrate the principles of diffraction. = 实验将演示衍射的原理。


虚拟语气:
If the wavelength were shorter, the diffraction would be less pronounced. = 如果波长更短，衍射就不会那么明显。
It is important that the diffraction grating be precisely aligned. = 衍射光栅必须精确对齐。


被动语态:
The diffraction pattern was carefully measured. = 衍射图案被仔细测量。
Diffraction effects are often observed in wave phenomena. = 波现象中经常观察到衍射效应。


疑问句:
What causes diffraction? = 什么导致衍射？
How is diffraction used in microscopy? = 衍射是如何在显微镜中使用的？


否定句:
Diffraction did not occur in this particular experiment. = 在这个特定的实验中没有发生衍射。
The results did not show any significant diffraction effects. = 结果没有显示任何明显的衍射效应。


PHRASE->
X-ray diffraction = X射线衍射
electron diffraction = 电子衍射
neutron diffraction = 中子衍射
Fraunhofer diffraction = 夫琅禾费衍射
