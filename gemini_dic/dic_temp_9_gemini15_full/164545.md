preevaporate: /ˌpriːɪˈvæpəreɪt/ | v. |预先蒸发|To evaporate something before another process.  This is not a common word and is often used in specific technical contexts, particularly in chemistry and engineering where a substance needs to be partially evaporated before further processing.  |例句：The sample was preevaporated to remove excess solvent before analysis. 样品在分析前进行了预蒸发以去除多余的溶剂。


The process of preevaporating a solution reduced its volume significantly before crystallization. 预蒸发溶液的过程在结晶之前显著降低了它的体积。|近义词：preheat, pre-dry|反义词：post-evaporate (not a standard word)|词性:动词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
They preevaporate the solution before adding the catalyst. 他们在添加催化剂之前预蒸发溶液。
The technician preevaporates the sample to concentrate it. 技术员预蒸发样品以使其浓缩。


一般过去时:
The scientists preevaporated the mixture to remove the water. 科学家们预蒸发混合物以去除水分。
The engineer preevaporated the liquid before the filtration step. 工程师在过滤步骤之前预蒸发了液体。


现在完成时:
They have preevaporated the solvent to improve the yield. 他们已经预蒸发了溶剂以提高产量。
The chemists have preevaporated all the samples for the experiment. 化学家们已经预蒸发了实验的所有样品。


过去完成时:
The mixture had been preevaporated before the reaction was initiated. 在反应开始之前，混合物已经被预蒸发了。
The sample had preevaporated significantly by the time the test began.  测试开始时，样品已经显著预蒸发了。


将来时:
They will preevaporate the solution overnight. 他们将在一夜之间预蒸发溶液。
The operator will preevaporate the liquid before performing the test. 操作员将在进行测试之前预蒸发液体。


虚拟语气:
If they preevaporated the liquid, the results would be more accurate. 如果他们预蒸发了液体，结果会更准确。
It would be better if they had preevaporated the sample. 如果他们预蒸发了样品，那就更好了。


被动语态:
The solution was preevaporated before being analyzed.  溶液在分析前被预蒸发了。
The sample is being preevaporated at the moment. 样品正在被预蒸发。


疑问句:
Was the solution preevaporated before the experiment?  实验前溶液是否被预蒸发了？
Have the samples been preevaporated yet? 样品是否已经预蒸发了？


否定句:
They did not preevaporate the solution. 他们没有预蒸发溶液。
The solution was not preevaporated adequately. 溶液没有充分预蒸发。


PHRASE->
preevaporate to dryness: 预蒸发至干
preevaporate under vacuum: 真空预蒸发
preevaporate at low temperature: 低温预蒸发
preevaporate the solvent: 预蒸发溶剂
preevaporate and concentrate: 预蒸发并浓缩


词源:  The word is a combination of "pre-" (meaning before) and "evaporate" (to turn from liquid into vapor).  It's a relatively modern coinage, formed by combining existing prefixes and roots to create a specific technical term.
