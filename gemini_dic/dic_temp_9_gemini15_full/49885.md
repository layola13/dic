词源：

The word "demure" ultimately derives from the Old French word "demourer," meaning "to remain," "to stay," or "to abide."  This sense of remaining quiet and reserved evolved into the modern meaning of the word.  The connection lies in the idea of someone who remains quiet and composed, not outwardly expressing strong emotions or opinions.
