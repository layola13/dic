The word "inimitabilities" is derived from the word "inimitable," which combines the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") with "imitable" (meaning "capable of being imitated").  The suffix "-ities" is a noun suffix indicating a state, quality, or collection of things.  Therefore, "inimitabilities" signifies the qualities or characteristics that cannot be imitated or copied.
