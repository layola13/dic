词源:  The word "jinked" is derived from "jink," which originally meant to move suddenly or erratically, often to avoid something. This sense is believed to have originated in nautical terminology, referring to a sudden change in course of a ship. Over time, "jink" came to be associated with the idea of avoiding bad luck, and then, ironically, with being subjected to bad luck itself. The transition from a verb ("to jink") to an adjective ("jinked") reflects this semantic shift. The precise etymology of "jink" is uncertain, but it may be related to words suggesting quick or evasive movement.
