USAGE->
This word is quite uncommon and doesn't lend itself to typical grammatical tense variations as demonstrated in the example.  The usage is limited to describing multiple instances of fatness.  Its use in different tenses would be awkward and unnatural.  Instead of using different tenses with "fattinesses," one would rephrase the sentence to convey the intended meaning.

For example, instead of:

* **Incorrect:** The fattinesses were increasing. (Awkward)
* **Correct:** His fat deposits were increasing. (Natural)
* **Correct:** His obesity was worsening. (Natural)

The same principle applies to other tenses (past, present perfect, future, etc.).  The focus should be on rephrasing to use more common and natural phrasing instead of forcing "fattinesses" into different grammatical structures.


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "fattinesses."  The word itself is very rarely used.
