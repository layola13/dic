plagionite:/ˈplædʒɪˌnaɪt/| n. |方铅矿|A lead sulfosalt mineral with the chemical formula Pb5Sb4S11.  It is usually found in low-temperature hydrothermal veins and is often associated with other sulfide minerals.  Its crystals are typically acicular (needle-like) or bladed, and it can range in color from dark gray to black.  Plagionite is relatively rare compared to other lead sulfides.|The sample contained several crystals of plagionite, clearly visible under the microscope.|近义词：boulangérite, jamesonite|反义词：无
