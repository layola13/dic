词源：

The word "craggednesses" is derived from the adjective "cragged," which itself comes from the Middle English word "crag," meaning "rocky peak" or "cliff."  The suffix "-ed" transforms the adjective into a past participle, while "-ness" is added to create a noun form, signifying a state or quality.  The final "es" indicates a plural.  Therefore, "craggednesses" refers to multiple instances of craggy or rugged terrain.
