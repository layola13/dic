coelacanth:/ˈsiːləkænθ/| n. |腔棘鱼|A coelacanth is a type of fish that was thought to be extinct, but was rediscovered in 1938.  It is a lobe-finned fish, meaning that its fins are fleshy and lobed, rather than simply fin rays. Coelacanths are considered living fossils because they have changed very little over millions of years.  They are deep-sea dwellers and are known for their unique adaptations to their environment. |The discovery of the coelacanth was a major scientific event.|近义词: lobe-finned fish, living fossil|反义词:  (no direct antonym)|名词
