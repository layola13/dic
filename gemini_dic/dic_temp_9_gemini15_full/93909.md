词源:

The word "immovability" is derived from the prefix "im-" (meaning "not"), the verb "move" (meaning "to change position"), and the suffix "-ability" (meaning "the quality or state of being able").  Therefore, it literally means "the state of not being able to be moved." The word's roots trace back to the Old French "mouvoir" and ultimately to the Latin "movere," both meaning "to move."
