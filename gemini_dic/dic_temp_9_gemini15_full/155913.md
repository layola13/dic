photoconversion:/ˌfoʊtoʊkənˈvɜːrʒən/| n. |光转换；光化学转化|The process by which light energy is converted into another form of energy, often chemical energy.  This process is crucial in photosynthesis and various other biological and chemical processes.  For example, in photography, photoconversion refers to the change in a photosensitive material caused by light exposure.|Example: The high efficiency of photoconversion in this new solar cell is remarkable.|近义词：light conversion, photochemical transformation|反义词：None specifically, but the opposite could be described as energy dissipation or energy loss without conversion.
