lipids:/ˈlɪpɪdz/ | n. |脂类，脂质 | Lipids are a group of naturally occurring molecules that include fats, waxes, sterols, fat-soluble vitamins, monoglycerides, diglycerides, and triglycerides.  They are insoluble in water but soluble in nonpolar solvents. Lipids have many important biological functions, including energy storage, structural components of cell membranes, and hormone production. | Example: Fats and oils are examples of lipids. 脂肪和油是脂类的例子。  The cell membrane is composed largely of lipids. 细胞膜主要由脂质构成。 |近义词：fats, oils,  |反义词：None (no direct antonym)
