USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective, and thus does not have typical verb conjugations like "what".  Its usage depends on the noun it modifies.  Examples below illustrate its use in different sentence structures:

PHRASE->
Non-statement responses are often used in:
Non-statement questions:  This is paradoxical, but refers to a question phrased in a way that does not directly solicit a declarative answer. (e.g., a rhetorical question)  非陈述性问题：这听起来矛盾，指的是以一种不直接寻求陈述性答案的方式提出的问题。(例如，反问句)
Non-statement answers:  These are answers that avoid a direct "yes" or "no" or a clear affirmative/negative.  非陈述性答案：这些答案避免直接的“是”或“否”或明确的肯定/否定。
Non-statement remarks: These are comments that don't express a defined opinion or fact.  非陈述性评论：这些评论没有表达明确的观点或事实。
Non-statement gestures: These are body language that don't convey a clear message.  非陈述性手势：这些是肢体语言，不能传达明确的信息。
Non-statement clauses: These are clauses which don't function as complete sentences.  非陈述性从句：这些从句不能作为完整的句子发挥作用。


NOTE:  There is no direct opposite of "non-statement" in the same way that "good" has "bad." The opposite is implied by using a phrase indicating a clear statement or declaration, such as "a definitive statement," "a clear assertion," or "an explicit declaration."
