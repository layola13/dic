redifferentiate: /ˌriːˌdɪfəˈrɛnʃieɪt/ | vt. | 再分化；重新分化 | To differentiate again; to undergo a second differentiation.  This term is primarily used in biological and cellular contexts, referring to the process where a cell or tissue changes from one specialized type to another.  It implies a reversal or a further specialization from a previously differentiated state. | Example:  The stem cells redifferentiated into neurons after exposure to the growth factor.  干细胞在接触生长因子后重新分化为神经元。


The embryonic cells redifferentiated into various tissues and organs. 胚胎细胞重新分化成各种组织和器官。 | 近义词:  specialize, transform, develop | 反义词: dedifferentiate
