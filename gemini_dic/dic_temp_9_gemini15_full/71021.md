The word "firmi" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:** Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word, like "firm," "fermi," or a word from another language. Please double-check the spelling.
* **It's a technical term:** It might be a specialized term used in a specific field (e.g., science, engineering).  If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to help.
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It could be a newly coined word or slang not yet widely recognized.


If you can provide more information or clarify the spelling, I can offer a more accurate and helpful response.
