词源:
The word "considerate" comes from the verb "consider," meaning "to think carefully about," combined with the suffix "-ate," which forms adjectives.  The root is the Latin "considerare," from "con-" (together) + "siderare" (to look at the stars, to reflect).  Therefore, the original meaning relates to careful thought and reflection, which evolved into the modern sense of thoughtfulness towards others.
