词源:
The word "overaccentuate" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "accentuate" (meaning "to emphasize" or "to give prominence to").  "Accentuate" itself comes from the Latin word "accentuare," which is derived from "accentus," meaning "accent" or "tone."
