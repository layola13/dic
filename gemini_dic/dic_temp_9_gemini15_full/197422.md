The word "sheeks" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or etymological information.  It's possible:

* It's a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "cheeks," "shrieks," or another word entirely?
* It's a slang term or dialect word not widely used.  If this is the case, please provide more context about where you encountered this word.
* It's a newly coined word or a proper noun.

Please provide additional context or a corrected spelling so I can assist you further.
