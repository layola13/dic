The word "nonpersuasivenesses" is not a commonly used word.  It's a relatively rare and artificially constructed noun.  It's formed by adding the plural "-es" to the noun "nonpersuasiveness," which itself is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "persuasiveness."

**Word Origin:**

* **persuade:**  From Latin *persuadere* ("to persuade"), from *per-* ("through," "thoroughly") + *suadere* ("to advise," "urge").
* **persuasiveness:**  From "persuade" + "-ive" (adjective suffix) + "-ness" (noun suffix).
* **nonpersuasiveness:** From "non-" (prefix indicating negation) + "persuasiveness."
* **nonpersuasivenesses:** The plural of "nonpersuasiveness."


**Usage:**

Because this word is uncommon, providing examples of its use in different grammatical tenses is impractical.  Its usage would mirror that of other plural count nouns.

**Example Sentences:**

* The presentation was riddled with nonpersuasivenesses, making it ineffective.  (演示文稿充满了缺乏说服力之处，使其无效。)
*  The judge cited several nonpersuasivenesses in the defendant's testimony. (法官指出了被告证词中几处缺乏说服力之处。)

**Near Synonyms:**

* Lack of conviction
* Weak arguments
* Unconvincing points
* Ineffectual reasoning
* Failures of persuasion


**Antonyms:**

* Persuasivenesses
* Powerful arguments
* Convincing evidence
* Effective reasoning



There is no need to provide examples for different grammatical tenses (present simple, past simple, etc.) because the word's usage would follow standard plural noun patterns.  The focus should be on understanding its meaning and its infrequent occurrence in common language.
