The word "rypheus" is not found in standard English dictionaries or etymology resources.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (perhaps a name or place), a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure field.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your format is impossible.  To provide an analysis, I need more context on where you encountered this word.
