词源：The word combines "dough," referring to something soft and easily molded, and "face," indicating the outward appearance of a person.  The implication is that the person's character is as malleable and shapeless as dough.  It originated in the 19th century, particularly associated with Northern Democrats who were perceived as being overly accommodating to Southern interests on the issue of slavery.
