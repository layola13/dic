词源:
The name "palladium" comes from the asteroid Pallas, which was discovered in 1802, the same year the element was discovered.  The asteroid itself was named after Pallas Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom, strategic battle, crafts, and skill.  Therefore, the name reflects the element's perceived value and importance.
