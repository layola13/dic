The word "obfirm" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It may be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure lexicon.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer some helpful suggestions.
