词源:

From pedant (a person who makes an excessive display of learning), ultimately from Italian "pedante," possibly from Latin "paedagogus" (teacher, schoolmaster), which in turn comes from Greek "paidagogos" (παιδαγωγός), literally meaning "child-leader".  The evolution reflects a shift in meaning from simply "teacher" to someone who is overly concerned with rules and details.
