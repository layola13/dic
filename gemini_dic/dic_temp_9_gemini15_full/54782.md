词源:

The word "dispensableness" is derived from the verb "dispense," meaning "to do without" or "to manage without."  Adding the suffix "-able" creates an adjective "dispensable," meaning "capable of being done without."  Finally, adding the suffix "-ness" transforms it into the noun "dispensableness," signifying the state or quality of being dispensable.  该词源于动词“dispense”，意为“无需”或“无需管理”。添加后缀“-able”构成形容词“dispensable”，意为“能够不用”。最后，添加后缀“-ness”将其转换为名词“dispensableness”，表示可有可无的状态或性质。
