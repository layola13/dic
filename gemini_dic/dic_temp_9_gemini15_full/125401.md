词源:
The word "multinucleated" is a combination of:

* **multi-**:  A prefix meaning "many" or "much."  Derived from Latin *multus*.
* **nucleated**:  Referring to a nucleus.  Derived from Latin *nucleus* (kernel, core).  "-ated" is a suffix indicating a state or condition.

Therefore, "multinucleated" literally means "having many nuclei."
