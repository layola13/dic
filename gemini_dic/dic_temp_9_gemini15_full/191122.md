scaphognathite:/ˌskæfəˈnæθaɪt/| n. |颚舟片(甲壳类动物)|The scaphognathite is a plate-like appendage found in many crustaceans, primarily used for creating water currents over the gills for respiration. It is located near the base of the maxillae. |Example: The shrimp's scaphognathite beat rhythmically, ensuring a constant flow of oxygenated water across its gills.  虾的颚舟片有节奏地跳动，确保持续不断的含氧水流流经它的鳃。|近义词：gill bailer (非精确)|反义词：N/A
