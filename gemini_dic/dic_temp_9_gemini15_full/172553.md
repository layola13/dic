pyrogen:/ˈpaɪrədʒən/| n.|致热原|A pyrogen is a substance that causes fever.  It is typically a bacterial product, but can also be derived from other sources.  Pyrogens trigger an immune response, leading to the release of cytokines and an elevation in body temperature.|Example: The intravenous solution was contaminated with pyrogens, causing the patient to develop a fever.  注射液被致热原污染，导致病人发烧。|近义词：endotoxin, fever-inducing agent|反义词：antipyretic


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Pyrogens cause fever. = 致热原引起发烧。
The solution contains pyrogens. = 该溶液含有致热原。


一般过去时:
The injection contained pyrogens that caused a reaction. = 注射液含有致热原，引起了反应。
The patient developed a fever due to pyrogens. = 病人因致热原而发烧。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several types of pyrogens. = 研究人员已经鉴定了几种类型的致热原。
Scientists have studied the effects of pyrogens on the body. = 科学家们已经研究了致热原对身体的影响。


过去完成时:
The patient had already developed a fever before the pyrogen source was identified. = 在致热原来源被确定之前，病人已经发烧了。
The test had shown the presence of pyrogens in the sample. = 测试显示样品中存在致热原。


将来时:
Scientists will continue to study pyrogens. = 科学家们将继续研究致热原。
This new drug will likely reduce pyrogen-induced fever. = 这种新药可能会降低致热原引起的体温升高。


虚拟语气:
If the solution were free of pyrogens, the patient would not have a fever. = 如果溶液不含致热原，病人就不会发烧。
It is important that the medical equipment be free of pyrogens. = 重要的是医疗设备不含致热原。


被动语态:
The fever was caused by pyrogens. = 发烧是由致热原引起的。
Pyrogens are detected using the LAL test. = 使用鲎试剂检测致热原。


疑问句:
Are there pyrogens in this sample? = 这个样品中含有致热原吗？
What types of pyrogens are commonly found in injections? = 注射剂中通常发现哪些类型的致热原？


否定句:
The solution did not contain any detectable pyrogens. = 该溶液不含任何可检测到的致热原。
The drug did not induce a pyrogenic response. = 该药物没有诱导致热原反应。


PHRASE->
pyrogen contamination = 致热原污染
pyrogen testing = 致热原测试
endotoxin pyrogens = 内毒素致热原
bacterial pyrogens = 细菌致热原
pyrogen-free = 无热原的
