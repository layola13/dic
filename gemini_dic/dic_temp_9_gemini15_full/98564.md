词源:
The word "instituted" comes from the Latin word "instituere," meaning "to establish," "to set up," or "to found."  The prefix "in-" means "in" or "into," and the root "-stituere" is related to "stare," meaning "to stand."  Thus, the word's etymology suggests the act of firmly establishing something, making it stand.
