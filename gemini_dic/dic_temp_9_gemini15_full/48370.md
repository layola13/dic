The word "decursive" is less common in modern English.  It's derived from the Latin "decurro," meaning "to run down" or "to flow down."  The prefix "de-" implies "downward," and "-cursive" relates to the root "currere," meaning "to run."

This word primarily functions as an adjective and describes something that is continuous in its movement or flow, often in a downward or onward direction.  It can be applied to physical phenomena (like rivers or water) or to abstract concepts (like thought processes or speech).  There is no common usage in different grammatical tenses as it's primarily a descriptive adjective, not a verb.  Therefore,  present, past, future tense etc. are not applicable to the word itself.
