词源:
The word "overchange" is a compound word formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "change" (referring to the money returned to a customer after a purchase).  Therefore, it literally means to give too much change.  The word's history follows the development of the word "change" in the context of monetary transactions.
