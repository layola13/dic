nonvagrantnesses:/ˌnɒnˈveɪɡrəntnəsiz/ | n. |非流浪状态；非游荡状态 | The word "nonvagrantnesses" is a rare and somewhat artificial-sounding noun. It refers to the state or quality of not being vagrant; the absence of vagrancy.  It's formed by adding the prefixes "non-" (meaning "not") and the suffix "-nesses" (a pluralizing suffix indicating multiple states or qualities) to the noun "vagrantness." Because "vagrantness" itself is not a commonly used word, "nonvagrantnesses" is even rarer and generally avoided in favor of simpler phrasing.  | Example:  The study focused on the contrasting lifestyles, highlighting the distinct nonvagrantnesses of the settled community versus the transient population. (此句例句略显牵强，因该词实际使用频率极低) |近义词: states of settledness, stability, permanence |反义词: vagrancies, wanderings, itinerancies |名词
