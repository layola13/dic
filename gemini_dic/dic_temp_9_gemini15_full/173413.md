quasi-energetic: /ˈkwɑːziˌɛnərˈdʒɛtɪk/ | adj. |准能量的，拟能量的 |  Describing systems or states that exhibit properties similar to those of energetic systems, but not exactly conforming to the strict definition of energy.  This term often arises in the context of periodically driven systems where the usual notion of energy conservation is violated.  The quasi-energy is a quantity that acts like energy but is only conserved modulo a multiple of the driving frequency. | Example:  The electrons in a periodically driven solid exhibit quasi-energetic states.  电子在周期性驱动固体中表现出准能态。| 近义词:  pseudo-energetic (less common)| 反义词:  energetic (in the strict sense)

If the system were perfectly periodic, it would have well-defined quasi-energies. = 如果系统是完美的周期性系统，它将具有明确的准能量。
I wish we had a better understanding of quasi-energetic processes. = 我希望我们对准能量过程有更好的理解。


被动语态:
