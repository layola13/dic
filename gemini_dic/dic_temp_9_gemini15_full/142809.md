This request is impossible to fulfill as "{ous}" is not a word.  It's a suffix, not a standalone lexical unit.  Therefore, it cannot have a pronunciation, definition, or be used in sentences in the way a full word can.  To provide an analysis, we need a specific word ending in "-ous".  For example, "famous," "dangerous," or "joyous."

Please provide a complete word ending in "-ous" for analysis.
