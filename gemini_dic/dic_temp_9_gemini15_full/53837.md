词源：

* **dis-:**  prefix indicating negation or reversal (similar to "un-" or "in-")
* **con-:** prefix often indicating togetherness or intensification
* **sol-:**  from Latin "solari" meaning "to comfort" or "to console"
* **-ate:**  suffix forming adjectives

Therefore, "disconsolately" literally means "in a way that is not consoled" or "without comfort."  It evolved from the verb "console," which means to comfort someone who is grieving or distressed.  The "dis-" prefix reverses the meaning, creating the sense of deep unhappiness and lack of comfort.
