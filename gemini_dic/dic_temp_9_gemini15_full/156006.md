photokinetically: /ˌfoʊtoʊkɪˈnɛtɪkli/ | adv. | 光动地，光致动力学地 |  Relating to or involving photokinesis, the movement of organisms in response to light.  | 例句：The algae exhibited photokinetically driven migration towards the light source.  藻类表现出光动驱动迁移到光源。


The word "photokinetically" is an adverb derived from the noun "photokinesis".


词源:

* **photo-:**  From Greek *phōs* (φῶς), meaning "light".
* **-kinesis:** From Greek *kīnēsis* (κίνησις), meaning "movement".
* **-ly:** Adverbial suffix.

Therefore, "photokinetically" literally means "in a manner relating to movement caused by light".


用法说明:

This word is primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly in biology and related fields, to describe the movement of organisms or other entities in response to light stimuli. It is not a common word in everyday conversation.  There are no direct synonyms or antonyms as the term is quite specific.  The closest related terms would describe the aspects of the process, such as "phototactically" (referring to directional movement towards or away from light) or descriptions of the movement itself (e.g., "migrating," "moving").  Antonyms would be terms describing movement unrelated to light, or movement against a light source.


例句:

* The bacteria moved photokinetically towards the blue light.  细菌光动地向蓝光移动。

* Photokinetically driven processes are crucial for many aquatic organisms. 光动驱动的过程对许多水生生物至关重要。


近义词:  None exactly, but related terms might include  phototactically,  light-driven movement.

反义词:  None exactly, but the opposite concept could be described as  "movement independent of light",  "dark-driven movement" (if such a term existed).

词性: adverb
