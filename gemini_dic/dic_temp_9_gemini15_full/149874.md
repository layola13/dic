词源:

The word "palimpsestic" derives from the Greek word "palimpsestos," which itself comes from "palin" (again) and "psao" (I scrape).  Originally, a palimpsest was a manuscript on which writing had been erased and overwritten.  The term has since broadened to describe anything with multiple layers of meaning or significance that have been superimposed over time.
