rhabdosphere:/ˈræbdəʊsfɪər/| n. |根际圈，根际鞘|The rhabdosphere is the microbiome associated with the root surface of plants, including bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. It plays a crucial role in plant health and nutrient uptake.|例句：Studies on the rhabdosphere are crucial for understanding plant-microbe interactions and developing sustainable agricultural practices.  根际圈的研究对于理解植物-微生物相互作用和发展可持续农业实践至关重要。|近义词：rhizosphere (although rhabdosphere is more specific)|反义词：None specifically, but terms describing environments lacking microbial diversity could be considered contrasting.
