词源:

The word "defective" comes from the Latin word "defectus," the past participle of "deficere," meaning "to fail," "to be wanting," or "to be lacking."  The prefix "de-" indicates removal or negation, while the root "-fect-" relates to making or doing. Thus, "defective" literally means "lacking something needed for completeness or proper functioning."


用法说明:

Defective is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that is imperfect, incomplete, or not functioning correctly.  It can apply to a wide range of things, from physical objects to abstract concepts.


例句:


1.  The company recalled the defective cars due to a serious braking issue. 公司因严重的制动问题召回了有缺陷的汽车。

2.  The detective found a defective link in the alibi.  侦探发现了不在场证明中一个有缺陷的环节。

3.  Her reasoning was defective; therefore, her conclusion was unsound. 她的推理有缺陷，因此她的结论不成立。

4.  The bridge was found to have defective supports.  人们发现这座桥的支撑结构有缺陷。

5.  A defective sentence lacks grammatical completeness.一个有缺陷的句子缺乏语法完整性。


近义词和反义词已经在上面列出。  没有提供动词或名词形式的例句是因为“defective”本身就是一个形容词，并不直接作动词或名词使用。  虽然可以衍生出一些用法，例如“a defective in the system”（系统中的缺陷），但这并非其主要用法。
