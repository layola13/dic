USAGE->  This word is primarily an adjective and doesn't have verb or noun forms, so tense conjugation is not applicable.  The usage focuses on describing the relationship between two or more things.

例句2:  Political and economic forces are interdetermining in the development of a nation. 政治和经济力量在国家的發展中是相互作用的。


PHRASE->  Because "interdetermining" is an adjective, it doesn't form common phrases in the same way verbs or nouns do.  Instead, it modifies nouns to describe their relationship:

Phrase 1: Interdetermining factors  相互作用的因素
Phrase 2: Interdetermining relationship 相互作用的关系
Phrase 3: Interdetermining processes 相互作用的过程
Phrase 4: Interdetermining forces 相互作用的力量
Phrase 5:  Interdetermining effects 相互作用的影响


词源:

The word is a combination of:

* **inter-**:  A prefix meaning "between," "among," or "mutually."
* **determining**:  The present participle of the verb "to determine," meaning "to establish definitively," "to decide," or "to influence."


Therefore, "interdetermining" literally means "mutually determining" or "determining each other."
