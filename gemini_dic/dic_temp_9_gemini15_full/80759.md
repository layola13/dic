gossan:/ˈɡɒsən/| n. |褐铁矿帽，铁帽 |A gossan is an iron-rich, typically reddish-brown, weathered rock found at or near the surface of the Earth. It is formed by the oxidation and leaching of sulfide minerals from underlying ore deposits. Gossans are often used by geologists as indicators of potential ore bodies because their presence suggests the existence of a primary sulfide mineralization at depth.  |Example: The geologist identified a gossan, suggesting the possible presence of copper ore beneath.  地质学家发现了一个褐铁矿帽，表明地下可能存在铜矿。|近义词：iron hat, iron cap, weathering rind |反义词：无


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The gossan indicates the presence of valuable minerals. = 褐铁矿帽表明存在有价值的矿物。
Geologists study gossans to find ore deposits. = 地质学家研究褐铁矿帽以寻找矿床。


一般过去时:
The prospector discovered a large gossan. = 探矿者发现了一个大型褐铁矿帽。
They analyzed the composition of the gossan. = 他们分析了褐铁矿帽的成分。


现在完成时:
Geologists have used gossans for centuries to find ore. = 地质学家几个世纪以来一直使用褐铁矿帽来寻找矿石。
We have identified several gossans in this area. = 我们在这个区域发现了几个褐铁矿帽。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, they had already studied the area's gossans. = 在发现之前，他们已经研究了该地区的褐铁矿帽。
The miners had followed the gossan for miles. = 矿工们沿着褐铁矿帽走了几英里。


将来时:
We will analyze the gossan samples next week. = 我们下周将分析褐铁矿帽样本。
They will use advanced techniques to study the gossan. = 他们将使用先进的技术来研究褐铁矿帽。


虚拟语气:
If the gossan were larger, it would indicate a richer ore body. = 如果褐铁矿帽更大，则表明矿体更丰富。
I wish we had found a more prominent gossan. = 我希望我们能找到一个更明显的褐铁矿帽。


被动语态:
The gossan was carefully examined by the experts. = 褐铁矿帽被专家仔细检查。
The location of the gossan is being investigated. = 褐铁矿帽的位置正在调查中。


疑问句:
What type of minerals does this gossan indicate? = 这个褐铁矿帽表明什么类型的矿物？
Is that a gossan or just a weathered rock formation? = 那是褐铁矿帽还是仅仅是风化的岩石构造？


否定句:
That formation is not a gossan; it's just a stained rock. = 那不是褐铁矿帽；它只是一块染色的岩石。
The prospectors did not find any significant gossans in the region. = 探矿者在这个地区没有发现任何重要的褐铁矿帽。


PHRASE->

gossan formation:褐铁矿帽形成
gossan alteration:褐铁矿化蚀变
gossan geochemistry:褐铁矿地球化学
