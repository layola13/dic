meniscus:/məˈnɪskəs/| n. |弯月面，月牙形，(液体)凹面|A meniscus is the curved surface of a liquid in a tube.  It is caused by surface tension and the adhesive forces between the liquid and the container. The meniscus can be concave (curved downwards) or convex (curved upwards) depending on the liquid and the material of the container.|例句：The water in the graduated cylinder had a concave meniscus. 量筒里的水有一个凹形的弯月面。

The mercury in the thermometer showed a convex meniscus. 温度计里的水银显示出一个凸形的弯月面。|近义词：curve, crescent|反义词：flat surface
