词源:
The word "protectibility" is derived from the verb "protect" and the suffix "-ibility," which indicates the capacity or capability of being something.  "Protect" itself originates from Old French "protegier" (to protect, defend), ultimately from Latin "protegere" (to cover, protect).  The "-ibility" suffix is a common English derivational suffix, often attached to verbs to form nouns expressing a capacity or capability.
