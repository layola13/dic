词源:

The word "devirgination" is derived from the Latin prefix "de-" (meaning "removal of" or "opposite of") and the word "virgination," which itself is derived from "virgin" (meaning "a person who has never had sexual intercourse").  Therefore, the word literally means "the act of removing virginity."
