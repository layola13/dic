词源:
The word "heathen" comes from the Old English word "hæþen," meaning "pagan," which itself is derived from the Old English word "hæþ," meaning "heath" or "open uncultivated land."  The association stems from the fact that pagans often lived outside of settled Christian communities.  The meaning shifted over time to primarily refer to those who did not follow Christianity.
