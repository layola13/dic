hydrogenating: /ˈhaɪdrədʒəneɪtɪŋ/ | v. | 氢化；使氢化 | The process of adding hydrogen to a substance, typically an unsaturated organic compound, to saturate the carbon-carbon double or triple bonds. This process often involves a catalyst.  | Example:  The manufacturer hydrogenated the vegetable oil to make it solid at room temperature.  制造商对植物油进行氢化处理使其在室温下呈固态。 |近义词：reducing (in a chemical context) | 反义词：dehydrogenating


USAGE->
一般现在时:
They hydrogenate vegetable oils to produce margarine. = 他们将植物油氢化以生产人造黄油。
The chemist hydrogenates the compound in the lab. = 化学家在实验室里将化合物氢化。


一般过去时:
Scientists hydrogenated the unsaturated fat to study its properties. = 科学家将不饱和脂肪氢化以研究其特性。
The company hydrogenated the oil to increase its shelf life. = 公司对油进行氢化处理以延长其保质期。


现在完成时:
Researchers have hydrogenated many different types of compounds. = 研究人员已经对许多不同类型的化合物进行了氢化处理。

过去完成时:
They had hydrogenated the sample before analyzing its composition. = 他们在分析样品的成分之前已经对其进行了氢化处理。
The reaction had been completed by the time the catalyst was removed. = 当催化剂被移除时，反应已经完成了。


将来时:
We will hydrogenate the reactant under controlled conditions. = 我们将在受控条件下对反应物进行氢化处理。
The plant will hydrogenate the feedstock to produce the desired product. = 该工厂将对原料进行氢化处理以生产所需产品。


虚拟语气:

The unsaturated fatty acids are hydrogenated to produce saturated fatty acids. = 不饱和脂肪酸被氢化以产生饱和脂肪酸。


疑问句:
Will the hydrogenation process be completed on time? = 氢化过程能否按时完成？
Has the compound been fully hydrogenated? = 化合物是否已完全氢化？


否定句:
The reaction did not proceed because the catalyst was not active enough. = 反应没有进行，因为催化剂不够活泼。
They did not hydrogenate the sample properly, leading to incomplete conversion. = 他们没有正确地对样品进行氢化处理，导致转化不完全。
