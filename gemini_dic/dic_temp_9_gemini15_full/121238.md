词源:
The word "miserables" is the plural of "miserable," derived from the Old French word "miserable," meaning "unhappy," "wretched," or "pitiful."  It's ultimately from the Latin "miser," meaning "wretched" or "unfortunate,"  combined with the suffix "-able," making it an adjective meaning "capable of being wretched."  When used as a noun, as in "Les Misérables," it refers collectively to those experiencing misery.
