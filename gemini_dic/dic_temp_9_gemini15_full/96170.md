词源:
The word "indeprecable" is derived from the Latin prefix "in-" (not) and the verb "deprecare" (to avert by prayer; to deprecate).  Therefore, it literally means "not able to be deprecated" or "not worthy of being deprecated."  The meaning shifted over time to its current sense of being beyond reproach.
