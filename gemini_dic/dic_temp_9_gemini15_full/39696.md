词源:
Considered comes from the verb "consider," which originates from the Old French word "considerer," meaning "to contemplate, to examine." This in turn derives from the Latin word "considerare," a compound of "con-" (together) and "siderare" (to contemplate the stars, to observe).  The suffix "-ed" transforms the verb into its past participle form, often used adjectivally.
