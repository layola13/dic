词源:

The word "semi-permanent" is a compound word formed from:

* **semi-**:  A prefix derived from Latin "semi-" meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."

* **permanent**: From Latin "permanere" meaning "to remain," "to stay," or "to last."


用法说明：

semi-permanent is primarily used as an adjective to describe things that are intended to last for a considerable period, but are not intended to be permanent.  It often describes things that can be easily removed or replaced when no longer needed.  This contrasts with "permanent," which implies lasting forever or for a very long time without change or removal.
