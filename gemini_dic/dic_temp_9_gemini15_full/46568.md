The word "dals" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please double-check your spelling.  Perhaps you meant "dahls," "dales," or another word entirely.

2. **A regionalism or dialect word:**  It might be a word used in a specific region or community.  If you encountered it in a particular context, providing that context would be helpful.

3. **A proper noun:** It could be an abbreviation or a name.

4. **A word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language.  If so, specifying the language's origin would be beneficial.
