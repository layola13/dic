词源:  The word "disciplined" comes from the Old French word "discipliné," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "disciplina," meaning "instruction," "teaching," or "training."  The Latin word itself is related to the verb "discipulus," meaning "pupil" or "disciple."  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the concept of self-control and orderliness acquired through training and instruction.
