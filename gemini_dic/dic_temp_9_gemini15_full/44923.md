cryptocrystalline:/ˌkrɪptoʊˈkrɪstəlɪn/| adj. |隐晶质的；微晶质的 | Crystalline materials are composed of crystals that are large enough to be seen with the naked eye or with a low-power magnifying glass.  Cryptocrystalline materials are composed of crystals that are too small to be seen without a microscope.  These materials typically have a fine-grained texture. |The chert sample exhibited a cryptocrystalline texture under the microscope.  显微镜下，燧石样品呈现出隐晶质结构。|microcrystalline, fine-grained |amorphous, glassy|
