词源:

The word "nonconcealment" is a relatively modern compound word. It's formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the noun "concealment" (the act of hiding or keeping secret).  "Concealment" itself derives from the verb "conceal," which has roots in the Old French word "concealer" (to hide) and ultimately from the Latin "con-" (together) and "celare" (to hide).


用法说明:

Nonconcealment is used to describe a situation or state where something is not hidden or kept secret. It emphasizes the deliberate act of revealing information or feelings.  The term is often used in contexts discussing honesty, transparency, and open communication.  It's less common than its antonym, "concealment," but can be found in academic writing, particularly in fields like philosophy, ethics, and political science, where the openness of information is crucial.  It is also used in legal settings to describe the lack of attempts to hide evidence or wrongdoing.  The word carries a positive connotation, suggesting honesty and integrity.
