词源:

The word is formed by combining:

* **over-**:  A prefix indicating excess or to a great degree.
* **sceptical**:  Adjective meaning tending to doubt or question.  This comes from the Greek "skeptikos," meaning "inquiring."
* **-ness**: A suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.

Therefore, "overscepticalness" literally means "the state of being excessively skeptical."
