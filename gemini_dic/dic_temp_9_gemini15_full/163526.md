precorrespond:/ˌpriːkɔːrəˈspɒnd/| adj.|预先通信；预先联系|  Relating to or involving communication or correspondence that takes place before a main event or action.  It is a relatively rare and newly coined word, not widely used in standard dictionaries.|例句：The precorrespondence between the two nations laid the groundwork for a peaceful treaty.  两国之间的预先通信为和平条约奠定了基础。


There is no established antonym for “precorrespondence” as it describes a specific action (communication before a main event) rather than a quality that could be opposed.  The closest would be  "postcorrespondence" (communication after the event), though this is not a standard word.
