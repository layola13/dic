copromoters:/koʊˈproʊmoʊtərz/ | n. | 共同启动子；协同启动子 |  A copromoter is a combination of two or more promoter sequences that work together to initiate transcription of a gene.  Unlike a single promoter, which may have a weak effect on gene expression, copromoters can significantly enhance gene expression by increasing the efficiency of RNA polymerase binding and transcription initiation. They are often found in operons or other gene clusters where coordinated expression is required. | Example: The researchers found that the combination of the two promoter sequences acted as a copromoter, resulting in significantly higher levels of gene expression.  研究人员发现这两个启动子序列的组合起到了共同启动子的作用，导致基因表达水平显著提高。 | 近义词：promoter elements, synergistic promoters | 反义词：repressor, silencer
