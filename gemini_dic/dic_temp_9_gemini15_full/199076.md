This word is a noun and does not conjugate through tenses like verbs.  It's a title, not an action.  Therefore, grammatical tenses (present, past, future, etc.) are not applicable.  The usage remains consistent.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "signora" as a core element in English, as it's an Italian term.  However, it is frequently used in Italian phrases, which would be translated to English.  For example,  "Buongiorno, Signora" (Good morning, Madam).
