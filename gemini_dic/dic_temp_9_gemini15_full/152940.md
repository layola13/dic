词源:
pediatrist's  is derived from "pediatrician" + "'s" (possessive).  "Pediatrician" itself comes from "pediatrics," which is from the Greek words "pais," meaning "child," and "iatrikos," meaning "pertaining to medicine or healing."  Therefore, "pediatrist's" literally means "belonging to a doctor of children."
