词源:
The word "salute" comes from the Old French word "saluer," meaning "to greet," "to salute," or "to salute." This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "salutare," which means "to wish health" or "to greet."  The original meaning emphasizes a well-wishing greeting, evolving over time to include the more formal military gesture of respect.
