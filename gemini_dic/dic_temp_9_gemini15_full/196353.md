serine:/ˈsɪəriːn/| n. |丝氨酸|Serine is a non-essential amino acid, meaning the body can synthesize it. It plays a vital role in various metabolic processes, including protein synthesis and the production of other important molecules.  It is also involved in the structure and function of many proteins and enzymes.| Example: Serine is a crucial amino acid for the proper functioning of many enzymes. 丝氨酸是许多酶正常发挥作用的关键氨基酸。|近义词:  (no direct synonyms, as it's a specific amino acid)|反义词: (no direct antonyms)|名词
