词源:
The word "deviled" in this culinary context ultimately derives from the older meaning of "devil," implying something mischievously spicy or exciting, suggesting a fiery, almost wickedly delicious quality.  The association with the devil likely stems from the pungent, fiery nature of the spices used, reminiscent of the traditional image of hellfire.  It's not directly connected to the religious concept of evil itself.
