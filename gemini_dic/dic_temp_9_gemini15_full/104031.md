The word "juka" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A proper noun:**  It might be a name (person, place, or thing) specific to a certain context.  If this is the case, please provide more information about where you encountered the word.
* **A word from another language:**  It could be a word borrowed from another language.  If so, please specify the language.
* **A newly coined word or slang:**  It might be a very recent addition to the lexicon, not yet widely recognized.


To provide the analysis you request, I need a valid English word.  Please clarify.
