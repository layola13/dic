PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "overnarrowly".  The adverb is typically used independently to modify a verb.


词源:

The word "overnarrowly" is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or too much) with the adverb "narrowly" (meaning in a limited or restricted way).  "Narrowly" itself derives from the adjective "narrow," ultimately from Old English *nearu ("narrow, close").
