词源:
The verb "slang" in this context originates from the Old Norse word "slangr," meaning a sling (a device used for throwing projectiles).  The image of throwing something, whether it be a physical object or insults, is central to the word's various meanings.  The transition from the physical act of slinging to the figurative act of hurling insults or spreading gossip is a natural semantic extension.
