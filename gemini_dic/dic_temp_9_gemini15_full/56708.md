词源:  The word "doomsaying" is a compound word. "Doom" comes from Old English "dōm," meaning "judgment, decision, fate," ultimately related to the Proto-Germanic "*dōmaz,"  which also gave rise to words like "deem" and "doom." "Saying" is the gerund form of the verb "to say,"  meaning "to express in words." Thus, "doomsaying" literally means "saying doom," or predicting misfortune.
