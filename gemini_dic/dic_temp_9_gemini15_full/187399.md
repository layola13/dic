roentgenium:/ˈrɛntɡənɪəm/ | n. | 錀 | Roentgenium is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol Rg and atomic number 111.  It is an extremely radioactive element; its most stable known isotope, <sup>282</sup>Rg, has a half-life of approximately 8 seconds.  It is named after Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, the discoverer of X-rays. | The discovery of roentgenium was confirmed in 1994 by a team of German scientists at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt. The element was created by bombarding bismuth-209 with nickel-64 ions.  |  The element roentgenium is primarily used in scientific research, particularly in nuclear physics.  There are no known practical applications outside of research due to its extreme radioactivity and short half-life.  |  近义词:  (None - it's a unique element) | 反义词: (None - it's a unique element) |  n.
