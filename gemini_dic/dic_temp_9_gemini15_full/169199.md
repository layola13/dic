词源:

The word "prolificnesses" is derived from the adjective "prolific"  + the suffix "-ness" (indicating a state or quality) + "-es" (pluralizing the noun).

"Prolific" originates from the Latin word "proles," meaning "offspring," and the suffix "-fic," meaning "making" or "producing." Therefore, "prolific" literally means "making offspring," and by extension, "producing abundantly."
