词源:
The word "consumer" comes from the verb "consume," meaning "to use up" or "to destroy."  It's ultimately derived from the Latin word "consumere," which is a combination of "con-" (together) and "sumere" (to take).  The noun form, "consumer," emerged later to describe someone who uses goods or services.
