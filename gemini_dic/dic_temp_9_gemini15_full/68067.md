词源:
The word "faddier" is derived from the word "fad," meaning a temporary fashion or craze.  Adding the suffix "-ier" creates the comparative adjective form, meaning "more fashionable" or "more trendy."  The ultimate origins of "fad" are uncertain, but it's possibly related to words suggesting quick movement or fading.
