词源:

The word "concise" comes from the Old French word "concis," which itself originates from the Latin verb "concidere," meaning "to cut down," "to cut short," or "to strike down."  The prefix "con-" indicates "together," and "-cidere" relates to "cutting."  Therefore, the original meaning directly relates to the cutting down or shortening of something,  leading to its modern meaning of brevity and clarity.
