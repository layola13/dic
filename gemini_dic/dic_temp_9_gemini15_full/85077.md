Etymology:  The term comes from the older phrase "to be hard pressed," meaning to be pressed or pushed hard, often in a figurative sense implying being under great pressure.  "Hard" intensifies the pressure, while "pressed" implies being squeezed or burdened. The modern adjective form "hard-pressed" directly derives from this phrasal verb.
