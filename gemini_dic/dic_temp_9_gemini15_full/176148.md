rbf:/ɑːrbiːˈɛf/| n.|径向基函数|Radial Basis Function (RBF) is a real-valued function whose value depends only on the distance from the origin, or more generally, the distance from a fixed point called a center.  They are commonly used in machine learning, particularly in approximation theory and neural networks, for their ability to approximate complex functions.|例句：We used radial basis functions to interpolate the scattered data points. 我们使用径向基函数来插值离散数据点。  The RBF network achieved high accuracy in predicting the stock prices.  RBF网络在预测股价方面取得了较高的精度。|近义词：kernel function, basis function|反义词：N/A
