chiliarchy: /ˌkɪliˈɑːrki/ | n. | 千人统治；千人政体 | A form of government ruled by a thousand people, typically a council or assembly.  This term is rarely used and often considered a neologism or a whimsical coinage, lacking widespread acceptance or established usage in political science.  It suggests a system aiming for broader participation than an oligarchy but less so than a democracy. The term is derived from combining "chiliad" (thousand) and "archy" (rule). | Example:  The fictional city-state implemented a chiliarchy, hoping to achieve a balance between elite governance and popular representation.  =虚构的城邦实施了千人统治，希望在精英治理和民众代表之间取得平衡。| 近义词: council rule, collective rule,  polyarchy (many rulers, broader than chiliarchy) | 反义词: monarchy, autocracy, dictatorship
