The word "bysmottered" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need a correctly spelled word or clarification of its intended meaning.
