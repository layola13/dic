词源：

* **reflect:**  This is the root word.  It comes from the Latin word "reflectere," which means "to bend back," "to turn back," or "to throw back."  The Latin prefix "re-" means "back" or "again," and "flectere" means "to bend."  The original sense thus involved the bending or turning back of something, like light.

* **-ive:** This suffix turns a verb (reflect) into an adjective (reflective).

* **-ly:** This suffix turns an adjective (reflective) into an adverb (reflectively).


用法说明：

reflectively describes the manner in which an action is performed. It emphasizes that the action is done in a thoughtful, contemplative, or introspective way, often implying a period of consideration or reflection before the action is taken.  It doesn't necessarily imply a slow or hesitant action, but rather an action informed by prior thought.
