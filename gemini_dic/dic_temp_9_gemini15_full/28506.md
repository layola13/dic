词源:

The word "cardboardy" is derived from "cardboard," which itself is a compound word.  "Card" comes from the Old French "carte," meaning "paper,"  and "board" refers to a flat piece of material.  The suffix "-y" is an adjective-forming suffix, indicating a quality or resemblance.  Thus, "cardboardy" means "like cardboard."
