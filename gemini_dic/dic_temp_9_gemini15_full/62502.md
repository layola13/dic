endothermisms:/ˌɛndoʊˈθɜːrmɪzəm/| n.|内温性，内热性|The process by which an organism maintains its body temperature primarily through internal metabolic processes.  It is a characteristic feature of endothermic animals, such as mammals and birds.|例句：The study focused on the endothermisms of various bird species in different climates.  这项研究关注不同气候下各种鸟类的内温性。|近义词：homeothermy|反义词：ectothermy|名词
