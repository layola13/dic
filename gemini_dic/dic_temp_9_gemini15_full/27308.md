calycozoa:/ˌkælɪˈkoʊzoʊə/| n. |萼腔动物门|A phylum of marine invertebrates characterized by a calyx-like structure and a unique feeding mechanism.  Calycozoa are considered to be closely related to other cnidarians but possess distinct morphological features. They are sessile, filter-feeding animals found in deep-sea environments.|Example:  The discovery of new calycozoa species expands our understanding of deep-sea biodiversity.  萼腔动物新物种的发现扩展了我们对深海生物多样性的理解。|近义词: (No direct synonyms, as it's a phylum)|反义词: (No direct antonyms, as it's a taxonomic classification)|名词
