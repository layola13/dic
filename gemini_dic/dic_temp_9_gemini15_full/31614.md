词源:

The word "chastise" comes from the Old French word *chastier*, meaning "to punish, correct." This, in turn, is derived from the Latin word *castigare*, which has the same meaning.  The Latin word is related to *castus*, meaning "pure, chaste," suggesting the idea of purifying someone through punishment.
