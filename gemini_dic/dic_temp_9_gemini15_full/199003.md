sigmoidal:/ˈsɪɡmɔɪdəl/ | adj. | S形曲线状的；乙状结肠的 | Having the characteristic S-shaped curve of a sigmoid.  The term is often used to describe a curve that increases gradually at first, then rapidly, before leveling off.  This shape is frequently observed in various natural phenomena and mathematical models. | Example: The growth curve of the bacteria showed a sigmoidal pattern.  细菌的生长曲线呈现S形模式。 The dose-response curve was sigmoidal.剂量反应曲线呈S形。|近义词：S-shaped, curve-shaped | 反义词：linear, straight


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The growth curve shows a sigmoidal pattern. = 生长曲线显示S形模式。
This model predicts a sigmoidal response. = 此模型预测S形响应。


一般过去时:
The experiment demonstrated a sigmoidal relationship. = 实验证明了S形关系。
The data points followed a sigmoidal curve. = 数据点遵循S形曲线。


现在完成时:
Researchers have observed many sigmoidal curves in nature. = 研究人员在自然界中观察到许多S形曲线。
Scientists have modeled this process using a sigmoidal function. = 科学家们使用S形函数模拟了这个过程。


过去完成时:
They had already analyzed the sigmoidal data before the presentation. = 他们在演示文稿之前已经分析了S形数据。
The team had expected to see a sigmoidal response, and they did. = 团队预期会看到S形响应，事实也如此。


将来时:
We will analyze the results to determine if they fit a sigmoidal model. = 我们将分析结果以确定它们是否符合S形模型。
The software will generate a sigmoidal curve based on the input data. = 软件将根据输入数据生成S形曲线。


虚拟语气:
If the data were perfectly sigmoidal, the analysis would be simpler. = 如果数据完全呈S形，分析将更简单。
It would be helpful if we could accurately model the sigmoidal growth. = 如果我们能够准确地模拟S形增长，那将很有帮助。


被动语态:
The sigmoidal curve was fitted to the data using a least-squares method. = 使用最小二乘法将S形曲线拟合到数据。
The sigmoidal relationship was clearly demonstrated in the results. = 结果清楚地证明了S形关系。


疑问句:
Is the growth curve truly sigmoidal? = 生长曲线真的是S形吗？
Does the model accurately represent the sigmoidal response? = 该模型是否准确地代表了S形响应？


否定句:
The relationship between the variables was not sigmoidal. = 变量之间的关系不是S形的。
The data did not follow a sigmoidal pattern. = 数据没有遵循S形模式。


PHRASE->
sigmoidal curve = S形曲线
sigmoidal function = S形函数
sigmoidal growth = S形增长
sigmoidal response = S形响应
sigmoidal transformation = S形变换

词源:
From "sigmoid," ultimately derived from Greek σιγμοειδής (sigmoeides), meaning "S-shaped," from σιγμός (sigmos) "sigma," the Greek letter Σ, and -ειδής (-eides), a suffix meaning "like" or "resembling."  The shape resembles the Greek letter sigma.
