词源:
The word "entrancing" comes from the verb "entrance," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "entrancier," meaning "to put into a trance."  The prefix "en-" indicates "in" or "into," and the root relates to the idea of being in a state of altered consciousness, often associated with fascination or enchantment.  Thus, "entrancing" describes something that puts someone into a state of captivated fascination.
