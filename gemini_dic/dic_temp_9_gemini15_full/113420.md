lymphocyte:/ˈlɪmfəˌsaɪt/| n. |淋巴细胞|A type of white blood cell that is part of the immune system and plays a crucial role in defending the body against infection and disease.  Lymphocytes are produced in the bone marrow and lymph nodes. There are several types of lymphocytes, including B cells, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, each with specific functions in immune responses. |Example:  The doctor ordered a blood test to check the patient's lymphocyte count.  医生开了验血单以检查病人的淋巴细胞计数。

The number of lymphocytes in the blood can indicate the presence of an infection or other health problems.  血液中淋巴细胞的数量可以表明感染或其他健康问题的存在。|近义词：leukocyte (white blood cell), immune cell |反义词：N/A

USAGE->

一般现在时:
Lymphocytes fight infection. = 淋巴细胞对抗感染。
The body produces lymphocytes in the bone marrow. = 骨髓产生淋巴细胞。


一般过去时:
The lab tested the patient's lymphocytes. = 实验室检测了病人的淋巴细胞。
Scientists discovered the role of lymphocytes in immunity. = 科学家发现了淋巴细胞在免疫中的作用。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several types of lymphocytes. = 研究人员已经鉴定了几种类型的淋巴细胞。
Doctors have used lymphocyte counts to diagnose diseases. = 医生一直使用淋巴细胞计数来诊断疾病。


过去完成时:
The immune system had already deployed lymphocytes before the infection became apparent. = 在感染变得明显之前，免疫系统就已经部署了淋巴细胞。
Scientists had not fully understood the function of all lymphocytes before recent studies. = 在最近的研究之前，科学家们并没有完全了解所有淋巴细胞的功能。


将来时:
Scientists will continue to study lymphocytes. = 科学家们将继续研究淋巴细胞。
New treatments will target specific types of lymphocytes. = 新的治疗方法将针对特定类型的淋巴细胞。


虚拟语气:
If the lymphocyte count were higher, the infection would be easier to fight. = 如果淋巴细胞计数更高，感染将更容易被对抗。
It is vital that lymphocytes function correctly. = 淋巴细胞的正常运作至关重要。


被动语态:
Lymphocytes are produced in the bone marrow. = 淋巴细胞在骨髓中产生。
The lymphocyte count was monitored closely. = 淋巴细胞计数受到密切监测。


疑问句:
What types of lymphocytes are involved in this immune response? = 这种免疫反应中涉及哪些类型的淋巴细胞？
Are low lymphocyte counts always indicative of disease? = 淋巴细胞计数低总是表示疾病吗？


否定句:
The patient did not have a low lymphocyte count. = 病人淋巴细胞计数不高。
This treatment did not affect the lymphocyte population significantly. = 这种治疗并没有显著影响淋巴细胞的数量。


PHRASE->

lymphocyte count: 淋巴细胞计数
lymphocyte activation: 淋巴细胞活化
lymphocyte proliferation: 淋巴细胞增殖
lymphocyte differentiation: 淋巴细胞分化
lymphocyte depletion: 淋巴细胞减少


词源:

lympho-  源自拉丁语 lympha，意思是“淋巴液”。
-cyte  源自希腊语 κύτος (kytos)，意思是“细胞”。  因此，lymphocyte 字面意思是“淋巴细胞”。
