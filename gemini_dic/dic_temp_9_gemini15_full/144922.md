词源:

The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or too much) and "theatrical" (relating to the theater or dramatic performance).  "Theatrical" itself comes from the Middle French *theatrical*, ultimately from the Latin *theatrum* (theater), which traces back to the Greek *θέατρον* (theatron), meaning "place for viewing."
