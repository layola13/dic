odontopteryx:/ˌɒdɒnˈtɒptərɪks/| n. |齿翼鸟属|An extinct genus of toothed birds from the Eocene epoch.  These birds were characterized by their long, slender beaks filled with numerous sharp teeth.  They are considered to be related to modern-day birds, but their exact phylogenetic placement is still debated.  Fossil evidence suggests they were likely aquatic or semi-aquatic, possibly feeding on fish. |Example:  The discovery of *Odontopteryx* fossils provided valuable insight into the evolution of avian dentition.  齿翼鸟化石的发现为了解鸟类牙齿的进化提供了宝贵的见解。|近义词:暂无精确近义词，可根据语境选择其他已灭绝的鸟类名称|反义词:暂无|名词
