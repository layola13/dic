precartilaginous:/ˌpriːkɑːrˈtɪlədʒɪnəs/| adj.|软骨前的，软骨形成前的|Relating to the stage of development before cartilage is formed.  The term describes a tissue or structure that is in the process of developing into cartilage, or that precedes the formation of cartilage.|Example: The precartilaginous mesenchymal cells eventually differentiate into chondrocytes.  软骨前的间充质细胞最终分化成软骨细胞。|近义词：prechondral|反义词：postcartilaginous
