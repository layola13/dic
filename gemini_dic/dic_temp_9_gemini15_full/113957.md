词源:
The name "Magdeburg" is of Slavic origin.  It derives from the Old Polabian *Magdeburg*, which is thought to be composed of two elements:  *maga* (meaning 'great' or 'powerful') and *burg* (meaning 'fort' or 'castle').  Therefore, the name literally translates to "great castle" or "powerful fort." The city's strategic location on the Elbe River made it an important settlement and contributed to its historical significance.  The name evolved through various linguistic changes over centuries to its present form.
