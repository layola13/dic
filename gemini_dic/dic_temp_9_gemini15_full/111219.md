lithosphere:/ˈlɪθəˌsfɪər/| n. |岩石圈 |The lithosphere is the rigid outer part of the earth, consisting of the crust and upper mantle.  It is broken into tectonic plates that move, causing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. |The lithosphere is constantly changing due to plate tectonics.  岩石圈由于板块构造而不断变化。|The movement of the lithosphere's plates causes mountains to form. 岩石圈板块的运动导致山脉的形成。|近义词：crust (in a geological context), earth's crust |反义词：atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The lithosphere supports all life on Earth. = 岩石圈支撑着地球上所有的生命。
The lithosphere is made up of tectonic plates. = 岩石圈由构造板块组成。


一般过去时:
Scientists studied the lithosphere's composition. = 科学家研究了岩石圈的成分。
The impact significantly altered the lithosphere. = 这次撞击显著地改变了岩石圈。


现在完成时:
Geologists have mapped a significant portion of the lithosphere. = 地质学家已经绘制了很大一部分岩石圈的地图。
Researchers have discovered new information about the lithosphere’s structure. = 研究人员发现了关于岩石圈结构的新信息。


过去完成时:
Before the earthquake, the stress on the lithosphere had built up. = 在地震发生之前，岩石圈上的压力已经积累起来。
Geologists had already theorized about the lithosphere's movement before the evidence was found. = 在证据被发现之前，地质学家就已经对岩石圈的运动进行了理论推测。


将来时:
Scientists will continue to study the lithosphere's impact on climate change. = 科学家们将继续研究岩石圈对气候变化的影响。
Further research will reveal more about the lithosphere's deep structure. = 进一步的研究将揭示更多关于岩石圈深层结构的信息。


虚拟语气:
If the lithosphere were less rigid, earthquakes would be less frequent. = 如果岩石圈不那么坚硬，地震就会减少。

The composition of the lithosphere was initially determined through seismic studies. = 岩石圈的成分最初是通过地震研究确定的。


疑问句:
How thick is the lithosphere under the oceans? = 海洋下方的岩石圈有多厚？
What processes shape the lithosphere? = 哪些过程塑造了岩石圈？


否定句:
The lithosphere is not a uniform layer. = 岩石圈不是一个均匀的层。
The lithosphere does not move as a single, solid piece. = 岩石圈不是作为一个整体的固体块移动。
