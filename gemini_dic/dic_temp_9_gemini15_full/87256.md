heritability: /ˌhɛrɪtəˈbɪləti/ | n. |遗传性，遗传率 | The proportion of variation among individuals that we can attribute to genes.  Heritability may vary, depending on the range of populations and environments studied.  | 例句：The heritability of intelligence is a complex and controversial topic.  智力的遗传性是一个复杂且有争议的话题。

The high heritability of certain diseases means they run in families.  某些疾病的高遗传性意味着它们会在家族中遗传。


近义词：inheritance, transmissibility | 反义词：non-heritability


词源:  Derived from "heritable," meaning capable of being inherited,  which in turn comes from the Old French "heritable" and ultimately from the Latin "hereditarius" (of or relating to inheritance).  The suffix "-ity" denotes a state or quality.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The heritability of height is estimated to be around 80%. = 身高的遗传率估计约为80%。
This study examines the heritability of different traits. = 这项研究考察了不同性状的遗传率。


一般过去时:
Researchers previously believed the heritability of this trait was lower. = 研究人员以前认为这种性状的遗传率较低。
The heritability of schizophrenia was a major focus of the study. = 精神分裂症的遗传性是该研究的主要重点。


现在完成时:
Scientists have determined the heritability of many human characteristics. = 科学家已经确定了许多人类特征的遗传率。
Studies have shown a significant heritability for this particular gene. = 研究表明，这个特定基因具有显著的遗传性。


过去完成时:
Before this research, the heritability of this disease was poorly understood. = 在这项研究之前，人们对这种疾病的遗传率知之甚少。
They had already established the high heritability of the condition in previous studies. = 在之前的研究中，他们已经确定了这种疾病的高遗传率。


将来时:
Future research will explore the heritability of other complex traits. = 未来的研究将探索其他复杂性状的遗传率。
Scientists will likely refine their estimates of the heritability of this gene. = 科学家可能会改进他们对该基因遗传率的估计。


虚拟语气:
If the heritability were higher, we would expect a stronger family resemblance. = 如果遗传率更高，我们会期望看到更强的家族相似性。
It is possible that, if environmental factors were removed, the heritability would be even higher. = 如果去除环境因素，遗传率可能会更高。


被动语态:
The heritability of the trait was found to be influenced by environmental factors. = 发现该性状的遗传率受环境因素的影响。
The heritability is being investigated using advanced genetic techniques. = 正在使用先进的基因技术研究遗传率。


疑问句:
What is the heritability of this particular disease? = 这种特定疾病的遗传率是多少？
How is the heritability of complex traits determined? = 如何确定复杂性状的遗传率？


否定句:
The heritability of this trait is not solely determined by genetics. = 该性状的遗传率并非仅仅由基因决定。
This study did not find a significant heritability for this behavior. = 这项研究没有发现这种行为具有显著的遗传性。


PHRASE->
high heritability  高遗传率
low heritability 低遗传率
heritability of a trait  性状的遗传率
heritability estimate 遗传率估计
broad-sense heritability  广义遗传率
