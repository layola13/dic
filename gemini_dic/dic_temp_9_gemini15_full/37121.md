combustion:/kəmˈbʌstʃən/| n. |燃烧，燃烧过程 |The rapid oxidation of a substance, accompanied by the production of heat and light.  Combustion is a chemical process that involves the reaction of a fuel with an oxidant, usually oxygen, to produce heat and light.  |Example: The combustion of fossil fuels is a major source of air pollution. 燃烧化石燃料是空气污染的主要来源。 The engine's combustion chamber was damaged. 引擎的燃烧室受损了。|近义词：burning, ignition, incineration|反义词：extinction


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Combustion produces heat and light. = 燃烧产生热和光。
The engine undergoes combustion to generate power. = 发动机通过燃烧产生动力。

一般过去时:
