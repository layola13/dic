词源:

The word "estimative" is derived from the verb "estimate," which ultimately comes from the Late Latin word "aestimatus," the past participle of "aestimare."  "Aestimare" itself is a compound of "ad-" (to) and "aestimare" (to value, assess).  The suffix "-ive" transforms the noun or verb into an adjective.


用法说明:


The adjective "estimative" describes something that is based on an estimate or approximation, rather than precise measurement or calculation.  It implies a degree of uncertainty or potential error.


例句:

The estimative figures for next year's budget are currently under review.  明年预算的估计数字目前正在审查中。

He made an estimative assessment of the damage caused by the storm. 他对风暴造成的损失进行了估计评估。
