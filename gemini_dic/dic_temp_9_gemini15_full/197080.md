词源:
Shamefacedness is derived from the adjective "shamefaced," which combines "shame" (meaning a painful feeling of humiliation or distress caused by the consciousness of wrong or foolish behavior) and "faced" (meaning having a face or expression).  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, denoting the state or quality of being shamefaced.  Therefore, shamefacedness signifies the state of being ashamed or embarrassed.
