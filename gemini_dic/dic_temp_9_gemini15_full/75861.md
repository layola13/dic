词源:

The word "functionalistic" is derived from "functionalism," which combines "function" and the suffix "-ism."  "Function" originates from the Latin word "functio," meaning "performance" or "execution." The suffix "-ism" denotes a doctrine, system, or practice.  Therefore, functionalism, and consequently functionalistic, refers to a system or theory that emphasizes function or purpose.
