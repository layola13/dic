The word "neele" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name or place name not widely known.
* **It's a word from a dialect or specialized jargon:** It might be used within a specific community or field.
* **It's a newly coined word:**  New words are created all the time, but without context, it's hard to determine its meaning.


To get a proper analysis, please provide more context where you encountered this word.  For example, tell me the sentence it appeared in, or the source where you found it.
