self-digestions:/ˌsɛlf daɪˈdʒɛʃən(z)/| n.|自体消化，自溶|The process by which a cell or organism digests its own components.  This can be a normal physiological process or a pathological one, such as in the case of cellular autolysis.|例句：Excessive self-digestions can lead to tissue damage. 过度的自体消化会导致组织损伤。|例句：The study investigated the role of self-digestions in apoptosis.  该研究调查了自体消化在细胞凋亡中的作用。|近义词：autolysis, autodigestion|反义词：synthesis, cell growth


USAGE->
