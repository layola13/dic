词源:
The word "patrolled" comes from the Old French word "patrouiller," meaning "to paddle," "to dabble," or "to splash."  This refers to the action of soldiers splashing through water or mud while on patrol. Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the general act of regularly moving through an area for security or surveillance.
