词源:
The word "counter-insurgency" is a compound word.  "Counter" is a prefix meaning "against" or "opposite," and "insurgency" refers to a rebellion against authority. "Insurgency" itself comes from the Latin word "insurgere," meaning "to rise up."  Therefore, "counter-insurgency" literally means "against a rising up" or "against rebellion."
