词源:
The word "denouncement" comes from the verb "denounce," which originates from Old French *denoncier and ultimately from Latin *denuntiare, meaning "to announce publicly," "to declare," or "to proclaim."  The "-ment" suffix indicates a noun formed from a verb, signifying the act or process of denouncing.
