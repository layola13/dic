词源:
The word "patrolwoman" is a compound word.  "Patrol" comes from the French word "patrouiller," meaning "to paddle" or "to wade," which evolved to mean to move around an area regularly to watch or guard it. "Woman" is the standard English word for an adult female.  Therefore, "patrolwoman" literally means a woman who patrols.
