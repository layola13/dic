词源:

The word derives from the noun "latitude," meaning "freedom from restriction; scope."  The suffix "-inous" transforms the noun into an adjective, signifying "having the qualities of."  Ultimately, "latitude" traces back to the Latin word "latitudo," a combination of "latus" (broad, wide) and the suffix "-tudo" (state or condition).  Therefore, "latitudinous" literally means "possessing the state or condition of breadth or freedom."
