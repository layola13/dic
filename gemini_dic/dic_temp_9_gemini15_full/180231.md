refractivity:/rɪˌfræktɪvɪti/| n. |折射率，折射性 |The ability of a substance to bend light.  It is expressed as the ratio of the speed of light in a vacuum to the speed of light in the substance. Refractivity is an important property in optics and is used to design lenses, prisms, and other optical components.| 例句：The refractivity of diamond is exceptionally high, giving it its brilliant sparkle.  钻石的折射率非常高，使其闪闪发光。

The high refractivity of the lens focused the light effectively.  透镜的高折射率有效地聚焦了光线。|近义词：refractive index, refractive power |反义词：N/A
