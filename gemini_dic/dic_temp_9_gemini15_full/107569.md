词源：

* **landlubber:** This is a compound word.
    * **land:**  From Old English *land*, meaning "land, ground, earth."
    * **lubber:** From Middle English *lubber*, meaning "a clumsy, awkward person; a lout."  The etymology is uncertain, but it may be related to words suggesting slowness or laziness.

* **-ness:** This suffix is added to adjectives to form nouns indicating a state, quality, or condition.  For example, "happy" becomes "happiness."

* **-es:** This is the plural suffix for nouns ending in -s, -sh, -ch, -x, or -z.

用法说明：

由于"landlubberliness"本身就比较少见，它的复数形式"landlubberlinesses"更是极少使用。  它主要用于强调有多种不同类型的陆地人特质同时出现的情况，或者用在幽默或夸张的语境中。  在正式写作中，通常会选择更简洁的表达方式。
