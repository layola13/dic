mesethmoid: /ˌmɛzɪθˈmɔɪd/ | n. |筛骨中板|The mesethmoid is a cartilaginous structure in the developing embryo that forms part of the nasal septum and contributes to the ethmoid bone. It is located in the midline of the face, between the two nasal cavities.  The mesethmoid eventually ossifies (turns to bone) and fuses with other bones of the skull.  |The developing mesethmoid contributes significantly to the structure of the nasal septum.|近义词:ethmoid cartilage, nasal septum cartilage |反义词:None|  词性:名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The mesethmoid contributes to the nasal septum. = 筛骨中板构成鼻中隔的一部分。
Embryonic development shows the mesethmoid's role in skull formation. = 胚胎发育显示筛骨中板在颅骨形成中的作用。


一般过去时:
The mesethmoid ossified during fetal development. = 筛骨中板在胎儿发育期间骨化。
Researchers studied the mesethmoid's contribution to facial morphology. = 研究人员研究了筛骨中板对面部形态的贡献。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified the mesethmoid's role in nasal structure. = 科学家已经确定了筛骨中板在鼻结构中的作用。
Studies have shown the mesethmoid's importance in craniofacial development. = 研究表明筛骨中板在颅面发育中的重要性。


过去完成时:
Before birth, the mesethmoid had already begun to ossify. = 出生前，筛骨中板已经开始骨化。
By the time of birth, the mesethmoid had largely fused with the other bones. = 到出生时，筛骨中板已在很大程度上与其他骨骼融合。


将来时:
Further research will illuminate the mesethmoid's complete function. = 进一步的研究将阐明筛骨中板的完整功能。
Scientists will continue to study the mesethmoid's development. = 科学家将继续研究筛骨中板的发育。


虚拟语气:
If the mesethmoid failed to develop properly, serious facial deformities could result. = 如果筛骨中板发育不良，可能会导致严重的颜面畸形。
It is hypothesized that if the mesethmoid were absent, nasal structure would be severely compromised. = 假设如果筛骨中板缺失，鼻结构将受到严重损害。


被动语态:
The mesethmoid is carefully examined during embryonic studies. = 在胚胎研究中，筛骨中板会得到仔细检查。
The role of the mesethmoid in nasal development is being actively investigated. = 筛骨中板在鼻发育中的作用正在积极研究中。


疑问句:
What is the precise role of the mesethmoid in facial growth? = 筛骨中板在面部生长中的确切作用是什么？
How does the mesethmoid contribute to the overall structure of the nose? = 筛骨中板如何促进鼻子的整体结构？


否定句:
The mesethmoid does not develop independently of other skull structures. = 筛骨中板并非独立于其他颅骨结构发育。
The study did not find any significant anomalies in the mesethmoid’s development. = 该研究没有发现筛骨中板发育中的任何重大异常。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "mesethmoid"  due to its highly specialized anatomical nature.  Phrases would involve descriptive terms like:  "development of the mesethmoid", "mesethmoid ossification", "mesethmoid cartilage", "abnormalities of the mesethmoid", "anatomy of the mesethmoid".
