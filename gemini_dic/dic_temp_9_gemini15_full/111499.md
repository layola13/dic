The word "loair" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a proper noun:  Is it a name, place, or brand?
* It's a technical term:  Is it specific to a particular field or jargon?
* It's a neologism:  Is it a newly coined word not yet in common usage?
* It's from a different language: If so, please specify the language.


Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you'd like me to assist you further.
