词源:  The word "freethinking" is a compound word combining "free" (meaning "unrestricted" or "independent") and "thinking" (the process of forming thoughts or opinions). Its roots trace back to the 17th century, associated with the rise of rationalism and skepticism as challenges to traditional religious authority.  The term gained prominence during the Enlightenment, reflecting a growing emphasis on individual reason and the questioning of established beliefs.
