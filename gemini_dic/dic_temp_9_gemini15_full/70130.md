fezzier:/ˈfɛziər/| adj.|更具异域风情的，更像 fez 的|  The word "fezzier" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It's likely a newly coined word or a misspelling.  It seems to be derived from "fez," a type of brimless felt hat, typically red, worn by men in some parts of the Middle East and North Africa. The suffix "-ier" suggests a comparative, implying "more like a fez" or "having more of the characteristics of a fez."  Therefore, it could describe something that has a more vibrant red color, a more distinctive shape reminiscent of a fez, or a general aesthetic that evokes a sense of Middle Eastern or North African culture. |Example:  The new restaurant had a fezzier atmosphere than the old one. (This sentence implies the new restaurant has a more pronounced Middle Eastern or North African feel.)|近义词: more exotic, more distinctive, more vibrant (depending on the intended meaning)|反义词: less exotic, less distinctive, more plain
