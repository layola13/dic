词源:
The word "predispose" combines the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") with "dispose," which ultimately derives from the Old French "disposer" (to arrange, set in order).  The "-ent" suffix turns it into an adjective.  Therefore, "predisponent" describes something that *prepares* or *sets the stage* for a particular outcome or condition.
