词源:
From Latin *pontificare, from pontifex "high priest," from pons "bridge," + facere "to make."  The original meaning referred to the pronouncements of a high priest, implying authority and often a degree of infallibility.  The modern usage retains the sense of authoritative pronouncements, but often with a negative connotation suggesting arrogance or dogmatism.
