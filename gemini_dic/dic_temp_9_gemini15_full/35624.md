词源:  The word "coatee" is derived from the earlier word "coat," ultimately from the Old French "cote," meaning "coat" or "side" (referring to the side of a garment). The suffix "-ee" indicates a person or thing that receives an action, but in this case, it's more of a diminutive or descriptive suffix, suggesting a shorter or more refined version of a coat.  The specific evolution to "coatee" denoting a particular style of short coat happened during the 18th and 19th centuries.
