词源:
The word "piggledy-piggledy" is of uncertain origin.  It's believed to be an onomatopoeic word (meaning it sounds like the thing it describes) and possibly a reduplication of an earlier word. Its first recorded use was in the 19th century.  The "pig" element doesn't necessarily relate to pigs themselves, but rather might reflect a sense of disorderly piling or rummaging.
