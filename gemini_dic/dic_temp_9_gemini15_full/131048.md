词源:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of."
* **axiom**: From Ancient Greek ἀξίωμα (axíōma), meaning "that which is thought worthy," "that which is considered self-evident."  An axiom is a statement or proposition that is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true.
* **-atic**: A suffix forming adjectives, often indicating "relating to" or "characterized by."


用法说明:

This word is primarily used in the fields of mathematics, logic, and philosophy to describe systems of thought or reasoning that do not begin with axioms.  It contrasts with "axiomatic," which implies a system built upon fundamental, unquestioned truths.  The word highlights the reliance on other forms of justification rather than self-evident principles.
