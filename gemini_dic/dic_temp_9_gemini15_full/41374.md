词源:The name "corkwing" is a descriptive term referring to the fish's appearance. "Cork" refers to the texture of its skin, which resembles cork, and "wing" likely refers to its pectoral fins.  The precise etymology requires deeper linguistic research into Old English/Middle English dialectal variations.  However, the compound nature is clearly descriptive.
