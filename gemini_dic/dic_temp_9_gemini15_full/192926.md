词源:
The word "seaworthy" is a compound word combining "sea" (referring to the ocean) and "worthy" (meaning deserving or suitable).  It's a relatively modern word, evolving from the earlier use of "sea-worthy" as two separate words.  The concept of a vessel's fitness for sea travel has, of course, existed for centuries, but the specific word "seaworthy" came into use later.
