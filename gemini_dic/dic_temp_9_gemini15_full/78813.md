词源:
The word "gimcrackery" is derived from "gimcrack," which itself is of uncertain origin.  Some etymologists suggest it may be a combination of "gim" (possibly related to "gam" meaning "game" or "trick") and "crack," implying something showy but easily broken or unreliable.  The "-ery" suffix denotes a collection or practice, thus "gimcrackery" signifies a collection of gimcrack items or the practice of dealing in them.
