precellency: /ˌpriːˈsɛlənsɪ/ | n. |卓越，杰出；（尤指）优秀；超群 | excellence, surpassing others in quality or achievement.  It is not a standard English word and lacks established usage.  It seems to be a neologism (newly coined word) possibly formed by combining "pre" (before, in advance) and "excellency," aiming to emphasize a superior quality or achievement beyond mere excellence. There are no established dictionaries that list it.
