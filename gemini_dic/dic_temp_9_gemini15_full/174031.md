词源:

The word "quasi-unified" is a compound word.

* **quasi-**:  This prefix is derived from the Latin word "quasi," meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."

* **unified**: This word comes from the verb "unify," which itself originates from the Latin word "unus," meaning "one."  The suffix "-ied" indicates the past participle form, creating the adjectival form "unified," meaning "made into one; united."


Therefore, "quasi-unified" literally means "almost unified" or "as if unified."
