There is no established entry for "shooker" in major dictionaries. The word seems to be a colloquialism or a very niche term, potentially a regional variant or a brand name.  Therefore, providing a detailed grammatical analysis with tenses, passive voice, etc., as requested for a common word like "what," is inappropriate and impossible for "shooker."  The word's usage is limited to its direct meaning as described above.
