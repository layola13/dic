词源:

The word "deponent" comes from the Latin verb *dēpōnere*, meaning "to put down," "to lay down," "to deposit," or "to state."  In a legal sense, it referred to the act of formally stating or giving evidence. The grammatical sense derives from the fact that these verbs "deposit" their meaning in a passive form.
