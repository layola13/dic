词源:  The word "lionize" comes from the word "lion," referring to the majestic and powerful nature of a lion.  The implication is that to lionize someone is to treat them with the awe and reverence typically associated with a lion. The suffix "-ize" indicates "to make or become."  Therefore, "lionize" essentially means "to make someone into a lion" – figuratively, of course, bestowing upon them a similar level of admiration and respect.
