词源:
The word "reined" comes from the Old French word "reine," meaning "rein," which in turn is derived from the Latin word "rena," meaning "kidney."  The connection lies in the use of the kidneys as a reference point for the position of the reins on a horse's back.  Over time, the meaning shifted to focus on the act of controlling the horse via the reins.
