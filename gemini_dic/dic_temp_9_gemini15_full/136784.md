词源:

The word "nonserviceability" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with "serviceability," which itself is derived from "serviceable" (capable of performing its intended function) and the suffix "-ability" (meaning "the state or quality of being").  Therefore, it literally means "not being serviceable."
