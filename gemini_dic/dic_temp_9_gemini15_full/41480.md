词源:

The word "cornmeal" is a compound word.  "Corn" derives from Old English *corn, referring to grain in general. Over time, in American English, "corn" became specifically associated with maize (Zea mays). "Meal" comes from Old English melu, meaning "ground grain."  Therefore, "cornmeal" literally means "ground maize."
