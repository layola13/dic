词源：
The word "dedolent" is not found in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a very rare and archaic word.  The prefix "de-" often suggests removal or negation, while "-dolent" is related to the word "dolorous" (meaning sorrowful or mournful).  Therefore, it's plausible that someone created "dedolent" to mean something like "free from sorrow" or, less likely given common usage of "de-", "causing sorrow".  The lack of established usage makes its precise meaning ambiguous.
