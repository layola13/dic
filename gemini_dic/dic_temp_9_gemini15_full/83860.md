The word "halely" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, word class, translation, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical examples as requested.  If there's a misspelling or it's a very rare or archaic word, please provide more context or the correct spelling so I can assist you.
