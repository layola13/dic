词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "prescriptive," which comes from the verb "prescribe" (meaning "to lay down a rule or order").  "Prescribe" ultimately derives from the Latin word "praescribere," meaning "to write before," implying setting down rules in advance.
