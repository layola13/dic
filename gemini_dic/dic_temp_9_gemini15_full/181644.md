词源:
The word "relay" ultimately derives from the Old French word "relais," meaning "a fresh horse or team of horses to take over a journey." This reflects the original sense of relaying something—passing something on to a new entity to continue the process.  The meaning extended to include the passing of messages, signals, and information.
