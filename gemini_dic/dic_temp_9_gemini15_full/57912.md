drillabilities:/ˌdrɪləˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可钻性，可钻探性 | The ability to be drilled, especially in relation to geological formations or materials.  This term refers to the ease or difficulty with which a material can be penetrated by a drill.  It considers factors like hardness, density, and geological structure. | Example: The drillabilities of the different rock layers varied significantly, impacting the drilling project's timeline.  不同岩层的可钻性差异很大，影响了钻探项目的进度。|近义词：drill ability, penetrability | 反义词：undrillability


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The drillability of this rock is high. = 这块岩石的可钻性很高。
We assess the drillabilities of various materials. = 我们评估各种材料的可钻性。

一般过去时:
The drillability of the shale was low last year. = 去年页岩的可钻性很低。
Engineers tested the drillabilities of several samples. = 工程师测试了几个样品的可钻性。

现在完成时:
We have determined the drillabilities of the target area. = 我们已经确定了目标区域的可钻性。
Geologists have improved the techniques for assessing drillabilities. = 地质学家改进了评估可钻性的技术。

过去完成时:
They had already evaluated the drillabilities before the drilling began. = 在钻探开始之前，他们已经评估了可钻性。
The team had underestimated the drillabilities of the deeper layers. = 该团队低估了较深岩层可钻性。


将来时:
We will determine the drillabilities of the new site next month. = 我们下个月将确定新场地的可钻性。
They will improve the drillabilities of their drilling equipment. = 他们将改进钻探设备的可钻性。


虚拟语气:
If the drillabilities were higher, the project would be completed sooner. = 如果可钻性更高，项目就能更快完成。
I wish the drillabilities of this rock were better. = 我希望这块岩石的可钻性更好。


被动语态:
The drillabilities were carefully measured by the team. = 可钻性由团队仔细测量。
The drillabilities are being analyzed by the experts. = 可钻性正在由专家分析。


疑问句:
What are the drillabilities of the different rock types? = 不同岩石类型的可钻性如何？
How do we improve the drillabilities of this formation? = 我们如何提高该地层的可钻性？


否定句:
The drillabilities were not as good as expected. = 可钻性不如预期好。
The engineers did not accurately predict the drillabilities. = 工程师没有准确预测可钻性。
