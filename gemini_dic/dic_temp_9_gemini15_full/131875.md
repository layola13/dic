词源:  The word "noncontagious" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "contagious."  "Contagious" comes from the Latin word "contagiosus," which is derived from "contingere" (to touch).  Therefore, "noncontagious" literally means "not capable of being spread by touch or contact."
