反义词：shortsightedness, myopia, imprudence


词源:

* **fore-**:  Prefix meaning "before" or "in front of."
* **sight**:  Noun referring to the ability to see.
* **-ed**:  Past participle suffix, here indicating a quality or state.
* **-ness**:  Suffix forming nouns of state or quality.

Therefore, "foresightedness" literally means "the quality of having sight before," implying the ability to see into the future.  The word evolved from the older word "foresight," adding the "-ness" suffix to create a more abstract noun referring to the characteristic itself.
