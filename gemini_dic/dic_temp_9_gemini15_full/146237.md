overexpressed:/ˌoʊvərɪkˈsprɛst/| adj.|过度表达的，表达过量的|  The term "overexpressed" describes a gene or protein that is produced at a higher level than normal.  This can be due to various factors, including gene mutations, gene amplifications, or errors in regulatory mechanisms. Overexpression can lead to altered cellular functions and potentially contribute to diseases like cancer. |例句：The oncogene was overexpressed in the cancer cells.  癌细胞中癌基因过度表达。

The study showed that the protein was significantly overexpressed in the diseased tissue. 研究表明，该蛋白质在患病组织中显著过度表达。|近义词：upregulated, amplified|反义词：underexpressed, downregulated
