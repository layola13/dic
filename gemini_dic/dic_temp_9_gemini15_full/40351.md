contractile: /kənˈtræktaɪl/ | adj. | 可收缩的，具收缩力的 | Able to contract or shorten.  This term often refers to the ability of muscle fibers or other tissues to shorten and produce movement. | Example:  The contractile proteins in muscle cells are responsible for muscle contraction. 肌细胞中的收缩蛋白负责肌肉收缩。

The heart muscle is highly contractile. 心肌具有很强的收缩力。


近义词: contractible, shortening | 反义词:  noncontractile,  uncontractible | 词性: adjective


词源:  From Latin *contractilis, from contrahere "to draw together," from com- "together" + trahere "to draw."  The suffix "-ile" indicates something having the capacity or nature of.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The muscle is contractile. = 肌肉是可收缩的。
This tissue shows contractile properties. = 这种组织表现出收缩特性。


一般过去时:
The muscle was contractile before the injury. = 受伤前，肌肉是可收缩的。
The experiment showed the tissue was highly contractile. = 实验表明该组织具有很强的收缩力。


现在完成时:

We predict that the muscle will remain contractile after the treatment. = 我们预测肌肉在治疗后仍将保持收缩性。


虚拟语气:
If the tissue were more contractile, the results would be different. = 如果组织更具收缩性，结果将会不同。
If the muscle fibers were less contractile, movement would be impaired. = 如果肌纤维收缩力较弱，运动就会受损。


被动语态:
The contractility of the muscle was measured. = 肌肉的收缩力被测量了。

疑问句:
Is the material contractile? = 该材料是否可收缩？
Are the cells still contractile after the treatment? = 治疗后细胞仍然具有收缩力吗？


否定句:
The muscle is not contractile. = 肌肉不可收缩。
The tissue showed no contractile response. = 该组织没有表现出收缩反应。


PHRASE->
contractile proteins: 收缩蛋白
contractile tissue: 收缩组织
contractile force: 收缩力
degree of contractility: 收缩程度
highly contractile: 高度收缩的
