Etymology:

The word "schoolmarm" is a compound word.  It combines "school" (meaning a place of education) and "marm," a shortened and somewhat informal version of "madam" or "ma'am," a term of respect for a woman. The term likely emerged in the 19th century, reflecting societal perceptions of female teachers at the time. The addition of "marm" contributed to the slightly condescending or stereotypical tone often associated with the word.  The diminutive "marm" suggests a degree of familiarity, sometimes bordering on disrespect, applied to a figure of authority.
