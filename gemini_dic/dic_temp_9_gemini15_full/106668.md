The word "kutauss" is not a recognized word in English.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a word from another language:**  If it's from another language, please specify the language so I can attempt a translation and explanation.
* **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word or slang term not yet widely known.  More context is needed.

Please provide more information so I can assist you better.
