magma:/ˈmæɡmə/ | n. |岩浆 |Hot, molten or semi-molten rock located beneath the surface of the Earth.  Magma is a complex mixture of silicate minerals, gases, and dissolved volatiles.  When magma reaches the surface, it is called lava. |例句：The volcano erupted, spewing forth rivers of incandescent magma.  火山爆发，喷出炽热的岩浆河流。

例句：Geologists study magma to understand the formation of igneous rocks. 地质学家研究岩浆以了解火成岩的形成。

近义词：lava (when erupted), melt |反义词：solid rock


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Magma flows beneath the Earth's surface. = 岩浆在地球表面下流动。
The volcano contains a large amount of magma. = 火山包含大量的岩浆。

一般过去时:
The magma chamber emptied during the eruption. = 岩浆库在喷发期间排空。
The geologist studied samples of solidified magma. = 地质学家研究了固化的岩浆样本。

现在完成时:
Scientists have studied magma for centuries. = 科学家们已经研究了几个世纪的岩浆。
Volcanic eruptions have released vast quantities of magma. = 火山喷发释放了大量的岩浆。

过去完成时:
The magma had already cooled before the samples were collected. = 在采集样本之前，岩浆已经冷却了。
The pressure had built up in the magma chamber before the eruption. = 在喷发之前，岩浆库中的压力已经积聚起来。

将来时:
Scientists will study the newly discovered magma flow. = 科学家们将研究新发现的岩浆流。
The eruption will likely release more magma. = 喷发可能会释放更多的岩浆。

虚拟语气:
If the magma were to reach the surface, it would erupt. = 如果岩浆到达地表，它就会喷发。
I wish I could study the magma directly. = 我希望我能直接研究岩浆。

被动语态:
The magma is being monitored by scientists. = 岩浆正在受到科学家的监测。
The rock was formed from cooled magma. = 这块岩石是由冷却的岩浆形成的。

疑问句:
What is the temperature of the magma? = 岩浆的温度是多少？
Where is the magma located? = 岩浆位于何处？

否定句:
The magma did not reach the surface this time. = 这次岩浆没有到达地表。
There isn't enough magma to cause a major eruption. = 没有足够的岩浆造成大规模喷发。
