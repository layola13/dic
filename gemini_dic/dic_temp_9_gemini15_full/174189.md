词源:  The noun "queerishness" is derived from the adjective "queer," which has a complex and evolving history.  Its origins lie in the Middle English word "queeren," meaning "to turn, twist, or cross," possibly from an Old Norse or Low German source. Over time, "queer" acquired negative connotations associated with being strange, odd, or different, particularly in relation to sexual orientation.  However, the word has been reclaimed by the LGBTQ+ community as a term of self-identification, often associated with pride and resistance to societal norms. "Queerishness," therefore, reflects the inherent oddness or strangeness that is associated with both the original and evolving meanings of "queer."
