The word "kaun" is not an English word.  It appears to be from another language, possibly Hindi or Urdu, where it means "who".  Therefore, a phonetic transcription, English definition, and English usage examples are not applicable.  To provide an analysis following your requested format, I need a valid English word.  If you provide an English word, I will be happy to give you a detailed analysis.
