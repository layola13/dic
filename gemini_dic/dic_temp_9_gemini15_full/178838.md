词源:
The word "recyclables" is derived from the verb "recycle," which itself comes from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the verb "cycle" (meaning "a complete round or series of events").  Therefore, "recyclables" refers to materials that can go through the cycle of being processed and reused again.
