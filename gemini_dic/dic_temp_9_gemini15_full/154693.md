词源：

The word "personnel" comes from the French word "personnel," meaning "personal,"  which in turn derives from the Latin word "personalis," an adjective meaning "of or belonging to a person." The shift in meaning from "personal" to "staff" happened in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, reflecting the increasing complexity of organizations and the need for a specific term to designate the people working within them.
