词源:

The word is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or to a degree exceeding what is normal or necessary), the verb "think" (to have thoughts or ideas), and the adverbial suffix "-fully" (meaning in a manner characterized by).  Therefore, "overthoughtfully" means "in a manner characterized by excessive thinking."
