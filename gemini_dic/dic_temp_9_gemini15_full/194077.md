词源:
The word "self-hopes" is a compound word combining "self," referring to oneself, and "hopes," plural of "hope," meaning a desire with an expectation of fulfillment.  The meaning thus arises directly from the combination of these two words.  There is no specific historical etymology beyond the history of the component words.
