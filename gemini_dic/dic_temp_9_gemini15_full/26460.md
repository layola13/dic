bytecode:/ˈbaɪtkoʊd/| n. |字节码|A set of instructions that are not directly executed by the computer's central processing unit (CPU), but are instead interpreted or translated into machine code by another program, such as a virtual machine (VM). Bytecode is an intermediate representation of code, often used in programming languages like Java, Python, and C#. It provides platform independence, meaning the same bytecode can run on different operating systems with the appropriate VM.  |Example: The Java compiler translates source code into bytecode, which is then executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  Java编译器将源代码转换为字节码，然后由Java虚拟机（JVM）执行。|近义词：intermediate code, virtual machine code|反义词：machine code, source code|名词
