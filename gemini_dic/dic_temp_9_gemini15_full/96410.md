词源:

The word "indisposition" comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") + "disposition" (meaning "state of mind, temperament, or physical condition").  Therefore, literally, it means "not being in a good state of health" or "not being properly disposed."  The word "disposition" itself has roots in the Old French "disposition" and ultimately from the Latin "dispositio," meaning "arrangement, order, preparation."
