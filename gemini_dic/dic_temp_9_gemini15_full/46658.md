词源:  The word derives from the story of Damocles, a courtier in the court of Dionysius I of Syracuse.  Damocles, envious of the tyrant's seemingly luxurious life, was invited to experience it firsthand.  However, Dionysius placed a sharp sword suspended by a single horsehair above Damocles' head during the feast, constantly reminding him of the ever-present danger and fragility of his seemingly enviable position.  This story serves as an allegory for the precarious nature of power and fortune.
