词源:

The word "party" in this context originates from the Old French "partie," meaning "part" or "share."  A party wall is a wall that is shared by two parties (owners of adjacent properties).  The word "walled" is simply the past participle of "wall." Therefore, "partywalled" describes a structure with a wall shared by two parties.
