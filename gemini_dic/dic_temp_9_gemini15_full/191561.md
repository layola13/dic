词源:
The word "scholasticized" is derived from "scholasticism," which itself comes from the Medieval Latin word "scholasticus," meaning "relating to a school or scholar."  Scholasticism was a system of theological and philosophical inquiry dominant in medieval universities.  The suffix "-ized" indicates the process of making something conform to the characteristics of scholasticism.
