词源:

The word "nazariteship" derives from "Nazarite," which comes from the Hebrew word נָזִיר (nāzīr), meaning "consecrated," "separated," or "dedicated."  A Nazarite was an individual who took a vow of consecration, observing specific rules of purity and separation under Jewish law. The suffix "-ship" is a noun suffix indicating state, condition, or quality.  Therefore, "nazariteship" denotes the state or condition of being a Nazarite.
