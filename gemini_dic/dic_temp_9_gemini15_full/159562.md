The word "polive" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, word class, meaning, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical examples as requested.  There may be a misspelling, or it might be a neologism (newly coined word), a technical term, or a word from a specific dialect.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer a more helpful response.
