词源:
The word "inconsiderate" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the verb "consider" (meaning "to think carefully about"), and the suffix "-ate" (forming an adjective).  Therefore, it literally means "not considering." The root "consider" traces back to the Latin "con-" (together) and "sidere" (to sit, to settle, to think).  The sense of careful thought developed over time.
