词源:
The word "misunderstander" is formed by combining the prefix "mis-" (meaning wrongly or badly), the verb "understand" (meaning to grasp the meaning of something), and the suffix "-er" (which forms nouns indicating a person who performs an action).  Therefore, it literally means "one who understands wrongly."
