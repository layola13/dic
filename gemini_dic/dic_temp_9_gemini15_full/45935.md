词源:
The word "cutty" is ultimately derived from the Middle English word "cutte," meaning "short" or "stubby." This term likely originated from the Old Norse word "kuttr," which also means "short." Over time, "cutte" evolved into "cutty," particularly in Scottish dialects.  Its use to describe a woman, particularly a sexually provocative one, is rooted in historical connotations and potentially linked to the imagery of a short, potentially revealing dress or skirt.  The derogatory implication is a later development.
