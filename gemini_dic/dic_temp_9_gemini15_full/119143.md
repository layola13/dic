The word "metum" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  It is possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:** Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a neologism:** A newly coined word not yet widely used.
* **It's from a specific field or dialect:** It might be a technical term or a word used within a particular community.
* **It's a word from another language:**  If it's from a different language, please specify the language so I can try to help.


Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you'd like me to assist you.
