overimaginativenesses:/ˌoʊvərɪˌmædʒɪnəˈtɪvnəsɪz/| n. |过度想象力；过度幻想；|The word "overimaginativenesses" is a rare and somewhat awkward word formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" (indicating plurality or a state of being) to "overimaginativeness," itself a combination of "over-" (excessive), "imaginative" (relating to imagination), and "-ness" (a state or quality).  It refers to multiple instances or aspects of excessive imagination or excessive fanciful thinking.  The word is generally avoided in formal writing due to its clumsiness.  It's more likely to be encountered in humorous or informal contexts.|His overimaginativenesses led him to believe aliens were visiting him.|近义词: excessive flights of fancy, unrealistic fantasies, delusions,  extravagant imaginings|反义词: realism, pragmatism, practicality
