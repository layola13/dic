词源:
The word "accompanied" comes from the Old French word "acompaigner," which means "to go with, to accompany."  This, in turn, has roots in the Latin word "com-," meaning "with," and "panis," meaning "bread."  The original meaning was more literally "to share bread with," implying companionship.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the broader sense of being together or providing accompaniment.
