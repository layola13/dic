reductionism:/rɪˈdʌkʃənɪzəm/| n. |还原论；简化论|The practice of analyzing and describing a complex phenomenon in terms of its simpler or more fundamental constituents, often to the detriment of understanding the emergent properties of the whole.  It is a philosophical approach that attempts to explain complex systems by reducing them to their simplest components.  This can be applied in various fields, including science, philosophy, and social sciences.  However, it can also be criticized for oversimplification and neglecting the importance of emergent properties.|Example:  The reductionist approach to understanding human behavior focuses solely on biological factors, ignoring social and cultural influences.  =  还原论理解人类行为的方法仅仅关注生物因素，而忽略了社会和文化的影响。

Example: Some critics argue that neuroscience suffers from reductionism, neglecting the complex interplay of brain regions and larger contextual factors. = 一些批评家认为神经科学存在还原论的问题，忽略了大脑区域之间以及更广泛的背景因素之间复杂的相互作用。
