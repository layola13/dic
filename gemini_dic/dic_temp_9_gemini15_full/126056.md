The word "mustar" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "muster," "master," or another word entirely.  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **It's a dialectal or regional word:**  Some words are used only in specific regions or dialects.  If you heard it somewhere, providing context (e.g., the region, the speaker) might help identify it.

3. **It's a newly coined word or neologism:** While unlikely, it's possible it's a very recent invention.

4. **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a name or place name.

Without more information, I cannot provide a detailed analysis as requested.  Please provide the correct spelling or more context.
