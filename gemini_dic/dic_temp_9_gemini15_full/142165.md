USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a very specific context (heraldry), so standard grammatical tenses and structures apply, but examples using "orle" in different tenses would be contrived and unnatural.  The focus should be on its use within descriptions of heraldry.


Example sentences illustrating its use:

Simple Present: The coat of arms features a silver orle on a blue field.  这枚纹章在蓝色底纹上饰有银色的卷曲状饰带。

Simple Past:  The ancient manuscript depicted a shield bearing a red orle.  这本古代手稿描绘了一面带有红色卷曲状饰带的盾牌。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "orle." Its usage is too niche.
