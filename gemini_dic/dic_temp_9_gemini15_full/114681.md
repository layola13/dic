词源:

The word "maligner" comes from the Old French word "maligne," meaning "evil," "wicked," or "malicious."  This in turn derives from the Latin word "malignus," which shares the same meaning. The suffix "-er" indicates an agent or doer of the action.  Therefore, a "maligner" is literally someone who acts with malice, spreading negativity and false information.
