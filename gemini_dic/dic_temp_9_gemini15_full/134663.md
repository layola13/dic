词源:

The word "nonmannered" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "mannered," which itself derives from "manner" (meaning "a way of behaving, speaking, or doing something").  The sense of artificiality or affectation implied in "mannered" is then negated by the prefix, resulting in the meaning "not affected, natural."
