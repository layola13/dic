词源:

The word "outfort" is a combination of "out" (meaning outside or away from) and "fort" (meaning a place of strength or defense, or figuratively, a place or position).  While not a standard dictionary entry, its meaning is clearly derived from its constituent parts, describing something that takes place or is situated outside.  The lack of a formal entry suggests it's a relatively informal or context-specific term.
