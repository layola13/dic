词源:
The word "plasticized" comes from "plasticizer" + "-ized".  "Plasticizer" is derived from "plastic" + "-izer". "Plastic" ultimately originates from the Greek word "plastikos," meaning "capable of being molded."  The suffix "-izer" denotes something that causes or produces a particular effect. Therefore, "plasticized" means "treated with a substance that makes something more moldable or flexible."
