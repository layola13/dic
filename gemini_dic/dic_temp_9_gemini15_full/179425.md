例句：

The paper investigates various types of reducibilities between different complexity classes. 这篇论文研究了不同复杂性类别之间的各种可约性。


Different reducibilities offer different insights into the relative difficulty of computational problems.不同的可约性提供了对计算问题相对难度的不同见解。


词源：

The word "reducibilities" is derived from the verb "reduce," meaning to make smaller or simpler.  The suffix "-ibility" denotes the quality or state of being able to be reduced.


"reduce"源自古法语"reduire", 最终源自拉丁语"reducere",由"re-" (再次)和"ducere" (引导，带领)构成。


用法说明：

Reducibilities are primarily used in the context of theoretical computer science, particularly in computability theory and complexity theory. They describe the relationships between different computational problems, indicating whether one problem can be "reduced" to another.  A reduction shows that if you can solve one problem, you can also solve another, often by transforming instances of the harder problem into instances of the easier problem.  Different types of reducibilities (e.g., many-one reducibility, Turing reducibility) exist, with varying strengths and implications.
