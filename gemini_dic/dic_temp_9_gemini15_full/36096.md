coenenchyma: /ˌkoʊənˈɛŋkɪmə/ | n. | 薄壁组织 |  Coenenchyma refers to a type of tissue found in some colonial organisms, particularly in certain cnidarians (like corals), characterized by a network of interconnected cells that form a living skeleton or supportive structure.  It is typically composed of cells with thin walls and often contains various other cell types, such as reproductive cells or specialized cells for nutrient transport. | Example: The coenenchyma of the coral provides structural support and facilitates nutrient exchange between polyps.  珊瑚的薄壁组织提供结构支撑并促进息肉之间的养分交换。| 近义词: connective tissue (in a broader sense) | 反义词:  scleractinian skeleton (in the context of coral structures, representing a hard, non-living skeleton)


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in biological contexts and doesn't lend itself to the grammatical examples requested for common words like "what".  The grammatical structures (present, past, future tenses, etc.) apply to sentences *using* the word "coenenchyma", but there are no inherent tenses within the word itself.  Here are example sentences illustrating its use:

Present Simple:  The coenenchyma supports the colony's structure. 薄壁组织支撑着群体的结构。
Present Continuous: The researchers are studying the coenenchyma's role in nutrient transport. 研究人员正在研究薄壁组织在养分运输中的作用。


Past Simple: The damaged coenenchyma impaired the coral's growth. 受损的薄壁组织损害了珊瑚的生长。
Past Continuous: They were observing the coenenchyma under a microscope. 他们正在显微镜下观察薄壁组织。


Future Simple: Scientists will analyze the coenenchyma's genetic makeup. 科学家们将分析薄壁组织的基因构成。
Future Continuous: We will be examining the coenenchyma's response to stress. 我们将研究薄壁组织对压力的反应。


Present Perfect:  Scientists have discovered a new function of the coenenchyma. 科学家们已经发现了薄壁组织的一个新功能。
Present Perfect Continuous: Researchers have been studying the coenenchyma for decades. 研究人员几十年来一直在研究薄壁组织。


Past Perfect: The polyps had already begun to regenerate after the coenenchyma injury. 在薄壁组织受伤后，息肉已经开始再生。
Past Perfect Continuous: The coral had been suffering from coenenchyma degradation before the intervention. 在干预之前，珊瑚一直遭受着薄壁组织退化的困扰。


PHRASE->

Phrases using "coenenchyma" are highly specialized and context-dependent within biological research. There aren't common, everyday phrases analogous to those for "what."  Examples would be part of a scientific discussion and would vary based on the specific research area.  For instance:

"Coenenchyma development" 薄壁组织发育
"Coenenchyma structure" 薄壁组织结构
"Coenenchyma regeneration" 薄壁组织再生
"Coenenchyma function" 薄壁组织功能
"Coenenchyma analysis" 薄壁组织分析
