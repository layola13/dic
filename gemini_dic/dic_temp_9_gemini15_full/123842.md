词源:
From "moral" (relating to principles of right and wrong) + "-ism" (a suffix indicating a doctrine, system, or practice).  Therefore, moralism literally means "the system or practice of morals."  The term often carries a negative connotation, suggesting an overly rigid or judgmental application of moral principles.
