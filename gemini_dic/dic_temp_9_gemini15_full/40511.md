controlability: /ˌkɒntrəʊləˈbɪləti/ /ˌkənˌtroʊləˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可控性，可控制度 | The ability to control something.  The degree to which a system or process can be controlled. |

例句：

The aircraft's high controlability impressed the test pilots. = 这架飞机极高的可控性给试飞员留下了深刻的印象。

The controlability of the robot arm is crucial for precise operations. = 机器臂的可控性对于精确操作至关重要。


近义词：manageability, controllability, governability


反义词：uncontrollability,  incontrollability


词源:

The word "controlability" is derived from the verb "control," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "controller," meaning "to check, verify."  The suffix "-ability" is added to indicate the quality or state of being able to be controlled.  The evolution reflects the shift from a focus on checking or verifying to the broader concept of managing or influencing something.
