词源:
The name "Mexico" comes from the Nahuatl word "Mēxihco," which referred to the Aztec capital city of Tenochtitlan, located on an island in Lake Texcoco.  The Nahuatl word is thought to derive from the name of the Mexica people, who founded the city.  The Spanish adopted the name, and it eventually became the name of the entire country.
