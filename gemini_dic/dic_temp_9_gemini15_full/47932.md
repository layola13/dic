词源:

The word "deception" comes from the Old French word "decepcion," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "deceptio," meaning "a misleading," "a deceiving."  "Deceptio" is formed from the verb "decipere," meaning "to deceive," which itself is a compound of "de-" (away, from) and "capere" (to take, seize, grasp).  Thus, the original meaning suggests the idea of "to lead away" or "to take away" (from the truth).
