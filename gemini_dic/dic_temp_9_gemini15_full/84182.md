词源：

The word is a compound of "half" and "quixotic."  "Quixotic" derives from "Don Quixote," the famous novel by Miguel de Cervantes.  Don Quixote, the main character, is known for his idealistic and impractical adventures, often tilting at windmills.  Therefore, "quixotic" describes someone or something that is idealistic, impractical, and perhaps even foolish.  "Half-quixotic" adds a nuance suggesting a less extreme version of this characteristic, implying a blend of practicality and idealism.
