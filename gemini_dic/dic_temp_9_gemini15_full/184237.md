resolvability:/ˌrɛzɒlvəˈbɪləti/| n. | 可分辨性；可解决性；可解析性 | The ability to be resolved or distinguished; the degree to which something can be resolved or distinguished.  This refers to the ability to separate or distinguish between different things, often in a technical context like image resolution or signal processing, or the ability to find a solution to a problem. | Example: The high resolvability of the microscope allowed us to clearly see the individual cells.  显微镜的高分辨率使我们能够清楚地看到单个细胞。  The resolvability of the conflict depends on the willingness of both parties to negotiate.  冲突的可解决性取决于双方愿意谈判的意愿。 | 近义词：distinguishability, solvability, clarity | 反义词：indistinguishability, insolvability, ambiguity | 名词

词源:

The word "resolvability" is derived from the verb "resolve," which comes from the Latin word "resolvere," meaning "to loosen, untie, dissolve, separate."  The suffix "-ability" indicates the capacity or potential for something to be done.  Therefore, "resolvability" signifies the capacity to be resolved, separated, or solved.
