词源:
The word is formed by combining the prefix "hyper-" (meaning excessive or beyond) with "scrupulously," which derives from "scruple," meaning a moral or ethical consideration.  Therefore, "hyperscrupulously" signifies an excessive degree of carefulness and conscientiousness, often bordering on being overly cautious or meticulous.
