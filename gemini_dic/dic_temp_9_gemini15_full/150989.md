paramorphism:/pəˈræməˌfɔːrˌfɪzəm/ | n. | 参数变形；参数同态 | A paramorphism is a type of function in category theory that generalizes the concept of a homomorphism.  It's a function between two algebraic structures that preserves the structure in a slightly weaker sense than a homomorphism.  Specifically, it respects the underlying structure but may not necessarily map the identity element to the identity element. | Example: In the context of lists, a paramorphism might accumulate a result across a list, similar to a fold, but with access to both the current element and the result of the recursive call on the tail of the list.  This allows for more complex computations than simple folds. |近义词:fold (in some contexts), catamorphism (related concept)|反义词:N/A|名词


USAGE->
(由于paramorphism是数学/计算机科学概念，没有常见的英语动词、形容词等用法，以下只提供在特定编程或数学场景下的例句)

Example 1 (Functional Programming):
A paramorphism efficiently calculates the sum of squares of elements in a list. = 一个参数同态高效地计算列表中元素的平方和。


Example 2 (Category Theory):
The paramorphism preserves the structure of the monoid, but not necessarily the identity element. = 参数同态保留了幺半群的结构，但不一定保留单位元。


PHRASE->
(由于paramorphism本身就是一个术语，没有常见的短语搭配)
