词源:

The word "miching" is derived from the Middle English word "michen," meaning "to steal," "to pilfer," or "to act secretly."  It's related to the Old English word "mician," which shares similar meanings. The shift in meaning from simply "secretly acting" to specifically "secretly plotting" likely occurred over time.  Its use in Shakespeare's Hamlet reinforces its association with clandestine activities and ill intent.

用法说明:

Due to its archaic nature, "miching" is almost exclusively found in literary contexts, particularly when evoking a Shakespearean or similar style.  It is not used in everyday conversation or modern writing.  Its usage is limited to situations where a deliberate choice is made to employ archaic vocabulary for stylistic effect.  The word implies more than just secrecy; it suggests a degree of malice or underhandedness in the secretive actions.
