词源:
The word "exsufflicate" is derived from the Latin prefix "ex-" (out, from) and the Latin word "sufflare" (to blow away, puff away, to inflate).  The original meaning alluded to something blown away or dismissed as unimportant, like a puff of smoke. Over time, the meaning solidified to its current adjectival sense.
