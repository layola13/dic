词源:
The word "intrinsicate" is derived from the Late Latin word "intrinsecus," meaning "on the inside, within."  The prefix "in-" means "in" or "into," while "trinsicus" is related to "intrinsecus," emphasizing the inner nature or complexity. Over time, the word evolved to describe things that are inherently complex due to their internal structure or details.


用法说明:
intrinsicate主要用作形容词，修饰名词，例如：design, system, process, problem, relationship等等。 它强调的是内部结构的复杂性，并非单纯的复杂程度。


注意：虽然intrinsicate在词典中可以找到，但在现代英语中，使用频率较低，更加常用的词是intricate, complex, convoluted等。  使用intrinsicate时，应确保其语境合适，以避免显得过于正式或古板。
