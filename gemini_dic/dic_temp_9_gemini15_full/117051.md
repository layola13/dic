The word "mcor" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or looking word?
* **It's an abbreviation or acronym:**  Does "mcor" stand for something within a specific context (e.g., a company name, technical term)?  Providing that context would be helpful.
* **It's a newly coined word or slang:**  If this is the case, more information about its origin and usage is needed.

Please provide more information so I can assist you better.
