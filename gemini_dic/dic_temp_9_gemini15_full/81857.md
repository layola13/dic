词源:
The word "gridiron" originates from the Old French word "gril," meaning "grill" or "grate." The addition of "-iron" further emphasizes the metallic nature of the cooking device.  Its use to describe the football field is a metaphorical extension, referencing the grid-like pattern of the field markings.
