The word "poetics's" is not a standard word in the English language.  It's an incorrect grammatical construction.  "Poetics" is already a noun, and adding "'s" attempts to make it possessive, which is grammatically unsound.  One would use a different structure depending on the intended meaning.

If you meant to express possession related to poetics, you would use one of the following depending on the context:


**Option 1:  The possessive of "poetics"**

* **Word:** poetics'
* **Pronunciation:** /pəʊˈɛtɪks/ (both US and UK)
* **Word Type:** Noun (possessive)
* **Translation:** 诗学的 (所有格)
* **Analysis:** This form shows possession. It indicates that something belongs to or is associated with poetics.  However, it's often stylistically better to rephrase than use this form.
* **Example:**  Poetics' principles are often debated.  = 诗学的原则经常被争论。
* **Synonyms:**  N/A (The entire concept needs rephrasing for synonyms)
* **Antonyms:** N/A
* **Usage examples (rephrased for clarity):**  Since "poetics's" is grammatically incorrect, usage examples will use correct phrasing.  Standard grammatical forms would be used instead, like "the principles of poetics," or "poetics' concerns."

**Option 2:  The subject performing an action related to poetics**

* **Word:** Poetics
* **Pronunciation:** /pəʊˈɛtɪks/ (both US and UK)
* **Word Type:** Noun
* **Translation:** 诗学
* **Analysis:** This is the standard form of the word referring to the study of poetry and its principles.
* **Example:** Poetics explores the nature of poetry. = 诗学探讨诗歌的本质。
* **Synonyms:**  The study of poetry, poetic theory
* **Antonyms:** N/A
* **Usage Examples:**
    * **General:** Poetics is a fascinating subject. (诗学是一个引人入胜的学科。)
    * **Possessive (rephrased):** The study of poetics offers insights into poetic form. (诗学的学习提供了对诗歌形式的见解。)


**Option 3 (if referring to something belonging to a specific poet):**  You would need to specify the poet's name.

* **Example:**  Shakespeare's poetics are complex. (莎士比亚的诗学很复杂。)


In summary, there is no correct usage of "poetics's".  The proper way to express possession or actions related to poetics depends on the context and requires rephrasing using standard grammatical forms.
