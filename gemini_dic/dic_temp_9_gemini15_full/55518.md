词源:
From distress (noun) + -ful (suffix).  Distress itself comes from Old French destresse, from des- (from Latin dis-) "away, apart" + estreit "narrow, strait," ultimately from Latin strictus, past participle of stringere "to bind, tighten."  The sense development is from "a tightening, affliction" to "distress."  The "-ful" suffix adds the meaning "full of" or "characterized by."
