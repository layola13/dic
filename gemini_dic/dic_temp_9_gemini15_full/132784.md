nonductilities: /ˌnɒnˌdʌkˈtɪlɪtiz/ | n. |非延展性；非展性| The lack of ductility; inability to be drawn out into a wire or hammered thin.  It refers to the opposite of ductility, describing materials that are brittle and easily fractured under tensile stress.  |例句：The high temperature nonductilities of the material limited its applications in high-stress environments.  高温下该材料的非延展性限制了其在高应力环境中的应用。


The nonductilities of ceramics make them unsuitable for applications requiring flexibility. 陶瓷材料的非延展性使其不适用于需要柔韧性的应用。|近义词：brittleness, fragility, inelasticity |反义词：ductility, malleability


USAGE->
This word is a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations.  Therefore, tenses such as present simple, past simple, etc., are not applicable.  The word itself describes a property and doesn't perform an action.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "nonductilities". The concept is typically described within a sentence describing material properties.  For example:  "High nonductilities were observed..."  or "The material exhibited significant nonductilities..."


WORD ORIGIN->

The word "nonductilities" is derived from:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of".
* **ductility**:  The ability of a solid material to deform under tensile stress; the ability of a material to be drawn into a wire.  This, in turn, comes from the Latin word "ductilis," meaning "easily led or drawn."


Therefore, "nonductilities" literally means "the state or quality of not being ductile."
