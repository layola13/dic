词源:
The word "implant" comes from the Latin prefix "im-" (meaning "in" or "into") and the verb "plantare" (meaning "to plant" or "to set").  The meaning therefore literally refers to "to plant in."  The use of the word in the context of medical devices is a relatively modern development, reflecting advances in surgical technology.
