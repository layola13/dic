laches:/ˈleɪtʃɪz/| n. |懈怠；疏忽；失职|The unreasonable delay in asserting a right.  Laches is an equitable defense, meaning it's used in courts of equity (as opposed to courts of law). It focuses on the unreasonable delay of a party in pursuing a claim, rather than a strict time limit like a statute of limitations.  The delay must cause prejudice to the other party. |例句：The court dismissed the case due to the plaintiff's laches in pursuing the claim. 法院因原告在追索索赔方面的懈怠而驳回了该案。

The defendant successfully argued laches because the plaintiff waited five years to file suit, during which time key evidence was lost.  被告成功地以懈怠为由进行了辩护，因为原告等了五年才提起诉讼，在此期间关键证据丢失了。|近义词：negligence, neglect, delay, procrastination |反义词：diligence, promptness, timeliness |名词
