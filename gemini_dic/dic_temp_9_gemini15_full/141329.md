近义词：publicly, frankly, overtly, visibly | 反义词：secretly, privately, covertly, clandestinely


词源：源自 open (adj. & v.) + -ly (adv. suffix).  The adverbial suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective "open" into an adverb, modifying verbs and describing how an action is performed.  The root "open" itself has a long history, stemming from Old English *open, related to the concept of being "unclosed".
