词源:

The word is a combination of:

* **quasi-:**  From Latin, meaning "as if," "seemingly," or "to a certain extent."  It indicates something that resembles something else but isn't truly that thing.

* **sentimental:** From French *sentimental*, ultimately from Latin *sentire* ("to feel").  Describes someone or something characterized by or expressing tender, emotional feelings.


Therefore, "quasi-sentimental" describes something that only *appears* to be sentimental, lacking genuine emotion or feeling.
