词源:
The word "hyperawareness" is a compound word.  "Hyper-" is a prefix derived from Greek ὑπέρ (hupér), meaning "over," "above," or "beyond."  "Awareness" is derived from Old English and refers to the state of being conscious of something. Therefore, "hyperawareness" literally means "excessive awareness" or "awareness beyond the normal level."
