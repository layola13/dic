词源:

The word "mirrory" is derived directly from "mirror," adding the suffix "-ory" which creates adjectives indicating resemblance or characteristic of something.  The root "mirror" itself comes from Old French "mirroir" and ultimately from Latin "mirari" meaning "to wonder at, admire."  The "-ory" suffix reflects the same pattern as in words like "factory" (from "fact"), "victory" (from "victor"), and "story" (from "story").
