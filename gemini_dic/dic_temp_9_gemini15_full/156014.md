photolithotrophic:/ˌfoʊtoʊˌlɪθəˈtrɒfɪk/| adj.|光合自养的|  Relating to or denoting organisms that use light as a source of energy and inorganic compounds as a source of carbon for growth.  Such organisms are photosynthetic but do not use water as an electron donor; instead they use other inorganic compounds. This is in contrast to photoautotrophs which use water as an electron donor.|例句：Many extremophiles, such as those found in hydrothermal vents, are photolithotrophic.|近义词：photoautotrophic (if water is used as the electron donor)|反义词：chemoheterotrophic, chemoautotrophic


USAGE->
