词源:  The word "individualized" is derived from the noun "individual" and the suffix "-ized."  "Individual" comes from the Late Middle English word "individuell," borrowed from Old French "individuel," ultimately from Latin "individuus" meaning "indivisible, single, unique."  The suffix "-ized" signifies "to make or become." Therefore, "individualized" means "made individual or unique."
