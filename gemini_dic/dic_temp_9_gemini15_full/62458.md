词源:

The word "endorse" comes from the Old French "endorser," meaning "to turn over," "to countersign."  This ultimately stems from the practice of writing one's signature on the back of a document, thereby signifying approval or transfer of ownership. The modern usage has broadened to encompass general support or approval.
