词源:
The word "gingham" has a somewhat uncertain etymology.  One theory traces it to Malay *ginggang, meaning "striped," but this is not universally accepted. Another suggests a possible connection to the French word "guingamp,"  referring to a town in Brittany, France, that was known for producing this type of cloth.  Ultimately, the exact origin remains debated among etymologists.
