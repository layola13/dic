词源:
From the verb "contend," meaning to struggle or compete, which comes from the Old French word "contendre," ultimately derived from the Latin word "contendere," meaning "to stretch out," "to strive," or "to struggle."  The "-er" suffix transforms the verb into a noun signifying a person who contends.
