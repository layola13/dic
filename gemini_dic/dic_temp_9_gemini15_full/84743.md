词源:
The word "handled" comes from the Old English word "handlian," meaning "to handle," which in turn is derived from "hand," meaning "hand."  The evolution reflects the core meaning of using one's hands to physically manipulate something, which has expanded metaphorically to encompass dealing with problems or situations.
