词源:
The word "overstressed" is formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") to the past participle "stressed" of the verb "stress."  The root of "stress" has origins in the Latin word "stringere," meaning "to bind tight" or "to strain."  Therefore, "overstressed" literally means "excessively strained or bound tight," reflecting the mental and physical tension associated with the condition.
