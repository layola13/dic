phototropisms:/ˌfoʊtoʊˈtrɒpɪzəm/| n. |向光性 |The directional growth of a plant in response to a light source.  Phototropism is a vital process for plants, enabling them to optimize their exposure to sunlight for photosynthesis. |Example:  The sunflower's phototropism is evident in its daily tracking of the sun. 向日葵的向光性在其每天追踪太阳的过程中显而易见。The seedling exhibited strong positive phototropism, bending sharply towards the light source.  幼苗表现出强烈的正向光性，强烈地弯向光源。|近义词：heliotropism|反义词：aphototropism
