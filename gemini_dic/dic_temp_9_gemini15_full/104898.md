词源:
The word "keepsake" comes from the earlier word "keep-sake,"  meaning something kept to be remembered. "Keep" is an old English word meaning "to preserve" and "sake" refers to a reason or cause.  The combination thus perfectly describes the function of a keepsake—something kept for the sake of remembrance.
