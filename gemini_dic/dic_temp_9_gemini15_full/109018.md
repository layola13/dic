leftpad:/ˈlɛftpæd/ | n. | 左填充 |  A function or routine in programming that adds padding (typically spaces or zeros) to the left side of a string to reach a specified length.  This is often used to align text or data.  For example, if you have a string "123" and you want to pad it to a length of 5 with spaces, the left-padded string would be "  123". |  The leftpad function is useful for formatting data for output or for ensuring consistent data lengths in applications.  | 近义词：pad (in the context of string manipulation), fill | 反义词：rightpad (adds padding to the right side)
