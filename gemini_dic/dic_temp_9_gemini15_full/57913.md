drillability: /ˌdrɪləˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可钻性，易钻性 | The ease with which a material can be drilled.  It considers factors like hardness, abrasiveness, and the presence of inclusions.  | Example: The rock's drillability was assessed before the drilling operation commenced.  岩石的可钻性在钻探作业开始前进行了评估。 | 近义词：permeability (in the context of drilling) | 反义词：undrillability


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The drillability of this rock is high. = 这块岩石的可钻性很高。
This material exhibits good drillability. = 这种材料具有良好的可钻性。

一般过去时:
The drillability of the shale was poor. = 页岩的可钻性很差。
We tested the drillability of several samples. = 我们测试了几个样品的可钻性。

现在完成时:
Engineers have determined the drillability of the formation. = 工程师们已经确定了地层的可钻性。
They have improved the drillability of the alloy. = 他们改进了合金的可钻性。

过去完成时:
Geologists had already assessed the drillability before the project began. = 地质学家在项目开始之前就已经评估了可钻性。
The team had underestimated the drillability challenges. = 团队低估了可钻性方面的挑战。

将来时:
We will assess the drillability of the new material next week. = 我们下周将评估新材料的可钻性。
The drillability will be a key factor in selecting the drilling method. = 可钻性将是选择钻探方法的关键因素。

虚拟语气:
If the drillability were higher, the project would progress faster. = 如果可钻性更高，项目进展就会更快。
I wish the drillability of this rock was better. = 我希望这块岩石的可钻性更好。

被动语态:
The drillability was tested using various drilling tools. = 可钻性是用各种钻探工具进行测试的。
The drillability is being evaluated by a team of experts. = 可钻性正在由专家团队进行评估。

疑问句:
What is the drillability of this type of soil? = 这种土壤的可钻性如何？
How can we improve the drillability of this rock? = 我们如何提高这种岩石的可钻性？

否定句:
The drillability of the rock was not good. = 岩石的可钻性不好。
They did not consider the drillability before they started drilling. = 他们在开始钻探之前没有考虑可钻性。
