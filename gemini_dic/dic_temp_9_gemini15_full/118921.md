The word "metely" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obsolete dialect.  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer a more helpful response.
