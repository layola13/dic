词源:
The word "carrier" comes from the Old French word "carier," meaning "to carry," which itself ultimately derives from the Latin word "carrus," meaning "cart" or "wagon."  The evolution reflects the original sense of the word as something or someone that transports goods or people.  The modern meanings have expanded to encompass various roles of carrying, transporting, or conveying something.
