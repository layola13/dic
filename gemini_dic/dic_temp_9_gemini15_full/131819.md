PHRASE->
This word is so rare that common phrases are unlikely.  Phrases would involve using it with prepositions or adjectives to modify its meaning, like:

a collection of nonconsequentialnesses
the significance of nonconsequentialnesses
avoiding nonconsequentialnesses
dealing with nonconsequentialnesses
the impact of nonconsequentialnesses


词源:

* **non-**:  prefix meaning "not"
* **consequential**: adjective meaning "following as a result or effect; important"
* **-ness**: suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives

Therefore, "nonconsequentialnesses" is the plural form of the noun formed by combining the negative prefix "non-", the adjective "consequential," and the noun-forming suffix "-ness".  It literally means "the state of being not important or irrelevant things".
