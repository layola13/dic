词源:
The word "polarities" derives from the Latin word "polaris," meaning "of or relating to the poles," which in turn is related to the Greek word "pólos," meaning "axis," "pivot," or "pole."  The suffix "-ities" indicates a state or condition.  Thus, "polarities" refers to the state of having poles or extremes.
