词源:

The word "demandable" is derived from the verb "demand," which comes from the Old French "demander" and ultimately from the Latin "demandare," meaning "to entrust," "to commit," or "to give in charge."  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or suitability.  Therefore, "demandable" literally means "capable of being demanded."
