The word "romic" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (like a name or place), a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specialized field not widely known.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide an analysis, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered "romic".
