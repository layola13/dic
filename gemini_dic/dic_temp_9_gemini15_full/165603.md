premetamorphic: /ˌpriːˌmɛtəˈmɔːrfɪk/ | adj. | 变质前的；前变质的 | Relating to the stage before metamorphism in rocks.  Describes rocks or geological processes that occur before the significant changes associated with metamorphism. | The premetamorphic sediments showed evidence of shallow marine deposition.  变质前的沉积物显示了浅海沉积的证据。|  pre-metamorphic | post-metamorphic | 形容词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The premetamorphic rock is primarily composed of shale. = 变质前的岩石主要由页岩组成。
This area shows evidence of premetamorphic volcanic activity. = 这个地区显示了变质前火山活动的证据。


一般过去时:
The premetamorphic structure was largely intact before the metamorphic event. = 在变质事件发生之前，变质前的结构基本完好无损。
Geologists studied the premetamorphic characteristics of the rock samples. = 地质学家研究了岩石样品的变质前特征。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several premetamorphic stages in this region. = 科学家们在这个地区已经确定了几个变质前的阶段。
Researchers have determined the premetamorphic composition of the metamorphic rock. = 研究人员已经确定了变质岩的变质前成分。


过去完成时:
The premetamorphic rock had already undergone some diagenetic changes. = 变质前的岩石已经经历了一些成岩变化。
Before the intense heat, the rock's premetamorphic structure had been relatively undisturbed. = 在高温作用之前，岩石的变质前结构相对未受到干扰。


将来时:
Further research will reveal more about the premetamorphic history of this area. = 进一步的研究将揭示更多关于该地区变质前历史的信息。
Geologists will analyze the samples to determine their premetamorphic mineralogy. = 地质学家将分析样品以确定其变质前的矿物学特征。


虚拟语气:
If the premetamorphic conditions were different, the resulting rock would be different. = 如果变质前的条件不同，产生的岩石也会不同。
It is hypothesized that if the premetamorphic sediment had been different, the metamorphism would have produced different results. = 假设如果变质前的沉积物不同，变质作用将产生不同的结果。


被动语态:
The premetamorphic rock layers were subjected to intense pressure and heat. = 变质前的岩层承受了巨大的压力和热量。
The premetamorphic environment is believed to have been a shallow marine setting. = 人们认为变质前的环境是浅海环境。


疑问句:
What were the premetamorphic conditions like in this area? = 这个地区的变质前条件是什么样的？
What is known about the premetamorphic history of these rocks? = 关于这些岩石的变质前历史，我们知道什么？


否定句:
The rock did not retain its premetamorphic features after the intense metamorphism. = 经过剧烈的变质作用后，岩石没有保留其变质前的特征。
The analysis did not reveal any clear evidence of premetamorphic structures. = 分析没有揭示任何清晰的变质前结构证据。
