词源:

The word "hypermagical" is a modern coinage. It combines "hyper-" (meaning "excessive," "beyond," or "above") with "magical" (relating to magic).  The prefix "hyper-" is derived from Greek ὑπέρ (hupér), meaning "over," "above," or "beyond."  "Magical" originates from "magic," ultimately from the Persian word *magus*, referring to a Zoroastrian priest.
