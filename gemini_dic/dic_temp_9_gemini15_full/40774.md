词源：
Convincibility is derived from the verb "convince," which comes from the Old French word "convincre," meaning "to overcome, subdue."  The "-ibility" suffix indicates the capacity or capability of being convinced.  Ultimately, the root traces back to the Latin word "vincere," meaning "to conquer" or "to overcome."
