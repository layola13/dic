/ˈɛn.ɛm.ɑːr/|/ˈɛn.ɛm.ɑːr/ | n. | 核磁共振；核磁共振成像 | Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a technique used to obtain detailed information about the structure and dynamics of molecules. It's based on the principle that atomic nuclei possess a magnetic moment and can absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation at specific frequencies when placed in a magnetic field.  This absorption and emission can be detected and used to create detailed images or spectra. |  NMR spectroscopy is used to identify the structure of molecules.  |  MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) |  | n.
