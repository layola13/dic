词源:  The word "pedantical" is derived from the word "pedant," which ultimately comes from the Italian word "pedante," meaning "schoolmaster" or "teacher."  The Italian word itself is likely derived from the Greek word "paidagogos," meaning "teacher of children" or "schoolmaster." Over time, "pedant" acquired a negative connotation, suggesting someone who is overly concerned with rules and displays of knowledge in an irritating manner.  "Pedantical" is simply the adjectival form of "pedant," describing something or someone that exhibits those characteristics.
