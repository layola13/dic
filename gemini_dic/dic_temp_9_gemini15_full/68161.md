词源:
The word "failure" originates from the Old French word "faillure," meaning "fault, defect, failing."  This, in turn, derives from the verb "faillir," meaning "to fail, to be lacking."  The English word "failure" evolved through Middle English and has maintained its core meaning of not succeeding or a defect.
