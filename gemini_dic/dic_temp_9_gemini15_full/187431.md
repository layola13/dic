The word "roial" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a very rare, archaic, or dialectal term.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need a correctly spelled word.  If you can provide the intended word, I will be happy to give you a detailed analysis.
