The word "navik" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are not possible.  It may be a proper noun, a word from another language (possibly Hindi or another South Asian language), or a misspelling.  To provide the requested analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** Knowing the source helps determine its meaning and origin.
* **What is the surrounding text or conversation?** Context clues can often clarify the meaning of an unfamiliar word.

If you can provide more information, I can try to assist in determining its meaning, origin, and usage.
