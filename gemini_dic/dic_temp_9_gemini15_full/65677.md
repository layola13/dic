The word "evene" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* It's a word from a specific dialect or jargon not widely known.
* It's a newly coined word or a proper noun.


Please provide the correct spelling or more context so I can help you.
