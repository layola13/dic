词源:

* **post-**:  A prefix meaning "after" or "following".  It comes from Latin *post*, meaning "after," "behind," or "following."

* **revolutionary**:  Derived from "revolution," which in turn originates from the Latin *revolutionem* (nominative *revolutio*), a noun meaning "a turning around," "a turning back," or "a complete change."  The word "revolution" gained its modern political meaning in the 17th and 18th centuries.
