Etymology:

The word "pillbox" is a compound word.  "Pill" refers to a small, rounded medicine, and "box" refers to a container. The combination directly describes its primary function. The use of "pillbox" to describe a military structure likely arose from a visual similarity – the small, round, fortified structures resembling the shape of a pill container.  The hat usage is a later metaphorical extension based on the shape.
