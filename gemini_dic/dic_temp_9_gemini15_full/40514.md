controllabilities:/ˌkənˌtrəʊləˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可控性，可控制性 | The study of controllabilities focuses on determining whether a system's state can be manipulated to achieve a desired outcome.  It's a crucial concept in various fields, including engineering and economics. | Example:  The controllabilities of the drone were tested rigorously before its launch.  无人机的可控性在发射前进行了严格的测试。 The controllabilities of the economy are a major concern for policymakers.  经济的可控性是政策制定者主要关注的问题。 | 近义词：controllability, manageability | 反义词：uncontrollability, unmanageability | 名词
