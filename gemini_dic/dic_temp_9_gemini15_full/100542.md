词源:
The word "interweavers" is derived from the verb "interweave," which itself is a combination of the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and the verb "weave."  "Weave" has Old English roots, tracing back to words meaning "to twist" or "to plait." Therefore, "interweave" literally means "to weave between or among," implying a complex mingling or blending.  The "-er" suffix is used to form the noun, denoting the agent or doer of the action.
