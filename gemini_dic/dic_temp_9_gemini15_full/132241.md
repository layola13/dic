USAGE->

This word is exceptionally rare and doesn't lend itself to common grammatical usage examples in the way "what" does.  The word itself is a complex noun formed through multiple derivations, and its usage is confined to highly specialized botanical or ecological contexts.  Providing examples of all tenses would be artificial and misleading.  Instead, here's a focus on how the noun might be used in a sentence:


Simple Present Tense:
The study focuses on the nondeciduousnesses observed in these high-altitude forests. 这项研究关注在这些高海拔森林中观察到的非落叶性。

Simple Past Tense:
Researchers were surprised by the nondeciduousnesses they discovered in the previously unknown species. 研究人员对他们在以前未知物种中发现的非落叶性感到惊讶。


PHRASE->

There are no common phrases using "nondeciduousnesses".  The word is too specialized.
