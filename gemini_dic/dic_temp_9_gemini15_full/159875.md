polymerized:/ˈpɑːlɪməraɪzd/| v. |聚合的；使聚合|To combine (simple molecules) to form a polymer.  The process involves the joining of many small molecules (monomers) to form a larger molecule (polymer) through chemical bonds. This process is crucial in the creation of many synthetic materials and natural substances.|例句：The monomers were polymerized to create a strong plastic. 单体聚合形成坚韧的塑料。

The styrene molecules were polymerized to form polystyrene. 苯乙烯分子聚合形成聚苯乙烯。

近义词：polymerise, chain, link |反义词：depolymerize, decompose

词源:
polymerized comes from the word "polymer," which itself is built from Greek roots:  "poly" (πολύς, meaning "many") and "meros" (μέρος, meaning "part").  The "-ized" suffix indicates that something has undergone the process of becoming a polymer.  Therefore,  "polymerized" means "made into a polymer" or "undergone polymerization".
