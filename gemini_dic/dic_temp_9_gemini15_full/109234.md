词源:

The word "leisurable" is derived from the noun "leisure," which ultimately traces back to the Old French word "loisir," meaning "free time" or "opportunity."  "Loisir" itself has roots in the Latin word "licere," meaning "to be permitted" or "to be allowed."  The suffix "-able" was added to create the adjective "leisurable," signifying something capable of being done at leisure or characterized by leisure.
