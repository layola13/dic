词源:
The word "leash" comes from the Old French word "laisse," meaning "band," "thong," or "string."  This ultimately derives from the Latin word "laxare," meaning "to loosen."  The seeming contradiction between the Latin root and the modern meaning arises because the original meaning referred to a rope used to *control* an animal, even if that control involved some degree of looseness.
