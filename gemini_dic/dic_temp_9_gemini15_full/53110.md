diphygenic: /ˌdaɪfɪˈdʒɛnɪk/ | adj. | 双源的；双生的 |  Derived from Greek "di-" (two) and "phy-" (growth, origin) and "-genic" (producing, generating).  It refers to something originating from two sources or having a double origin, especially in the context of biological development or evolution.  For example, a diphygenic organ is an organ that develops from two different embryological sources.  The term is less frequently used in everyday language and is more common in specialized scientific fields like botany and zoology.
