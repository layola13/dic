The word "Euclidean" is derived from the name of the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid (c. 300 BC), who is considered the "father of geometry." His book *Elements* presented a systematic exposition of geometry that dominated the field for over two thousand years, and the geometry described in that book is now known as Euclidean geometry.  The adjective form "Euclidean" was created to describe concepts, theorems, and systems related to Euclid's work.
