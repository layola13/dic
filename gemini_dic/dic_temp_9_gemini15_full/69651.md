词源:

The word "fence" comes from Old French "fence," meaning "a row of pales or stakes," which in turn derives from Vulgar Latin *fēncia, a variant of Latin *fīncia, a derivative of *fīxum, the neuter of the past participle of *fīgō, "to fix, fasten."  The meaning evolved from the literal sense of a fixed barrier to its figurative uses.
