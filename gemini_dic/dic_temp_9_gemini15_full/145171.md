词源：

The word "overattached" is a compound word formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the adjective "attached" (meaning "connected emotionally").  "Attached" derives from the Old French word "atacher," meaning "to fasten" or "to bind," ultimately from the Latin word "attaccare," which also means "to fasten" or "attach."


用法说明：

"Overattached" is primarily used to describe a person's emotional state, indicating an unhealthy level of dependence or clinginess toward another person or object.
