carbohydrates:/ˌkɑːrboʊˈhaɪdreɪts/ | n. |碳水化合物|Carbohydrates are one of the three main macronutrients, along with proteins and fats, that provide energy to the body. They are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, and are classified into simple and complex carbohydrates based on their chemical structure and how quickly they are digested.  Simple carbohydrates, such as sugars, are quickly broken down and absorbed, while complex carbohydrates, such as starches and fibers, take longer to digest.  They are essential for providing energy, storing energy, and building certain structures in the body.|例句：A balanced diet should include a variety of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.  均衡的饮食应该包括各种碳水化合物、蛋白质和脂肪。

例句：Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are good sources of complex carbohydrates. 水果、蔬菜和全谷物是复合碳水化合物的良好来源。


近义词：sugars, starches, polysaccharides | 反义词：None (no direct antonym, but one could contrast them with proteins or fats). | 词性：n.

词源:
The word "carbohydrate" is a combination of "carbo-" (from "carbon") and "-hydrate" (from "water").  This reflects the chemical composition of carbohydrates, which are essentially carbon atoms combined with water molecules (H2O).  The term was coined in the 19th century as our understanding of organic chemistry advanced.
