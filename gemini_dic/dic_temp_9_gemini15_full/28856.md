词源:
The term "carpet bombing" is a relatively recent addition to the English language, emerging during World War II. It combines "carpet," referring to the widespread coverage of the bombing, and "bombing," the act of dropping bombs from aircraft.  The imagery suggests a complete and indiscriminate covering of the target area.


用法说明:
Carpet bombing is almost exclusively used in the past tense (carpet-bombings) as it refers to historical events. It is a noun, describing the act or the event of such bombing.  While it’s possible to construct sentences using it in other tenses, it would sound unnatural and likely refer to a planned event rather than a historical occurrence.
