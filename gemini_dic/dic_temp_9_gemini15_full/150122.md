词源:
The word "pamperize" is a relatively recent coinage, likely derived from the verb "pamper," meaning to indulge excessively.  The "-ize" suffix is added to create a verb signifying to make or treat in a certain way.  The root of "pamper" itself is uncertain, but possible etymologies connect it to Old French words relating to indulgence or self-indulgence.
