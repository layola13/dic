词源:  Derived from the adjective "lean," meaning thin or slender.  The "-est" suffix indicates the superlative degree, signifying the highest degree of leanness.  The word's roots trace back to Old English "hlēan," meaning to incline or bend.  Over time, this evolved to encompass the sense of being thin or slender, likely due to the association of a thin physique with a less bulky or less upright posture.
