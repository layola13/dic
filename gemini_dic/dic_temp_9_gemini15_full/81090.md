The word "grama" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps you meant "grammar," "gram," or a word from another language?  Providing more context would be helpful.

2. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a place name, a person's name, or the name of a company or product. Again, more context is needed.

3. **It's a regional or dialectal word:**  It might be used informally in a specific region or community.

4. **It's a neologism:** It could be a newly coined word not yet widely adopted.

Without further information, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  Please clarify the word or provide context for a proper response.
