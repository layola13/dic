词源:
The word "clonality" derives from the word "clone," which itself originates from the Greek word "klōn," meaning "twig" or "slip."  The biological use of "clone" emerged in the 20th century, referring to the asexual reproduction of genetically identical organisms. The suffix "-ality" denotes a state or quality, thus "clonality" describes the state of being a clone or having characteristics of clones.
