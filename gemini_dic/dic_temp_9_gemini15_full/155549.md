词源:
The word "philistinism" is derived from the biblical Philistines, a people who were often portrayed in the Old Testament as enemies of the Israelites and uncultured.  The term acquired its current meaning in the 19th century, largely due to the writings of Goethe and other German Romantic thinkers who contrasted the Philistines' perceived lack of aesthetic and intellectual appreciation with their own ideals.
