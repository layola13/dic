词源:
The word "playsome" is a relatively rare and informal word. It's a combination of "play" and the suffix "-some," which is used to form adjectives that mean "full of" or "characterized by."  Therefore, playsome literally means "full of play" or "characterized by play."  It doesn't have a long and established history like many other words in the English language; its usage is more recent and reflects a colloquial or informal style.
