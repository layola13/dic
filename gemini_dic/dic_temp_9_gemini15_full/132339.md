nondegenerateness:/ˌnɒnˌdɪdʒɛnərətənəs/ | adj. | 非退化性，非简并性 | The quality or state of not being degenerate; the property of a system or mathematical object not possessing any special or exceptional symmetries or properties that would simplify its analysis.  It often implies a certain robustness or stability. For example, in linear algebra, a nondegenerate bilinear form is one that maps every nonzero vector to a nonzero scalar. In physics, a nondegenerate energy level is one that does not share its energy with other states. | Example: The nondegenerateness of the energy levels is crucial for the stability of the system.  非能量级的非简并性对于系统的稳定性至关重要。The nondegenerateness of the matrix ensures the uniqueness of the solution. 矩阵的非退化性确保了解的唯一性。 | 近义词：nonsingularity, regularity | 反义词：degeneracy
