The word "enwall" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide the requested analysis following the given format.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?

2. **It's a neologism or technical term:** It might be a newly coined word, a slang term, or specific to a particular field (like a technical jargon). If this is the case, providing more context about where you encountered this word would be helpful.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name (person, place, or thing).  Again, context is needed.
