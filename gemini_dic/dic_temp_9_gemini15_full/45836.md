WORD ORIGIN->
The word "customizers" is derived from the verb "customize," which itself comes from the word "custom."  "Custom" originally meant "habit" or "usual practice." Over time, it evolved to mean "the practice of making things to order," leading to the verb "customize" meaning "to make or modify something to meet a particular need or preference."  The suffix "-er" is added to form the noun "customizer," indicating a person who performs the action of customizing.
