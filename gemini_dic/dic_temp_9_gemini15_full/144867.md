词源:
The word "overrate" is formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "rate" (meaning "to assess the value or quality of").  Therefore, it literally means "to rate too highly".  The verb "rate" itself has origins in Middle English, ultimately deriving from Old French *rater.
