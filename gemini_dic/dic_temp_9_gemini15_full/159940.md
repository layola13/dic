polyphore:/ˈpɒlɪfɔːr/| n. |多心皮的，多心皮植物|A polyphore is a type of gynoecium (the female reproductive part of a flower) that consists of multiple, separate carpels.  Each carpel is a unit containing an ovary, style, and stigma.  Unlike a syncarpous gynoecium where carpels are fused together, a polyphore has distinct, free carpels. This characteristic is often used in plant taxonomy and classification.|Example:  The flower of the strawberry exhibits a polyphore, with numerous separate achenes (small, dry fruits) clustered on a fleshy receptacle.|近义词: multi-carpellate|反义词: syncarpous
