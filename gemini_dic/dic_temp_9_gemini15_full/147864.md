词源:

The word "overrationalize" is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to an excessive degree) and "rationalize" (to attempt to justify one's actions, decisions, or feelings with logical reasons, often self-deceptively).  The root "rational" comes from the Latin "rationalis," meaning "reasoning" or "relating to reason."
