oolite:/ˈoʊəlaɪt/| n. |鲕粒灰岩，鲕粒岩|Oolite is a sedimentary rock composed of ooids, which are spherical grains formed by the precipitation of calcium carbonate around a nucleus.  These grains are typically small, usually less than 2 mm in diameter.  Oolites are often light-colored and may be used as building materials.|例句：The Bath stone, famous for its use in many historical buildings, is a type of oolite. 巴斯石，以其在许多历史建筑中的使用而闻名，是一种鲕粒灰岩。|例句：The geologist identified the sample as an oolite based on its characteristic spherical grains. 地质学家根据其特征性的球形颗粒确定该样品为鲕粒岩。|近义词：oolitic limestone|反义词：无|名词
