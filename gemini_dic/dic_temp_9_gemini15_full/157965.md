planimeter:/plæˈnɪmɪtər/| n. |平面仪，求积仪 |A planimeter is a measuring instrument used to determine the area of a plane surface, such as an irregular shape on a map or drawing.  It works by tracing the perimeter of the shape, and the instrument mechanically calculates the area. | Example: The architect used a planimeter to calculate the area of the irregularly shaped lot.  建筑师用平面仪计算不规则地块的面积。 The engineer employed a planimeter to measure the cross-sectional area of the river. 工程师用平面仪测量河流的横截面积。|近义词：integrator, area measurer |反义词：N/A
