homeostasis:/ˌhoʊmiˈoʊsteɪsɪs/| n. |体内平衡；稳态；恒定性 |The biological process by which an organism maintains a stable internal environment despite changes in its external environment. This involves a complex interplay of physiological mechanisms that regulate temperature, blood pressure, pH, glucose levels, and other critical parameters.  |The human body maintains homeostasis through a variety of mechanisms, including sweating to regulate temperature and releasing hormones to control blood sugar. 人体通过多种机制维持体内平衡，包括出汗调节体温以及释放激素控制血糖。|equilibrium, balance, stability |instability, imbalance, disequilibrium| 名词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Homeostasis is crucial for survival. = 体内平衡对生存至关重要。
The body maintains homeostasis through various mechanisms. = 机体通过各种机制维持体内平衡。


一般过去时:
The patient's homeostasis was disrupted by the illness. = 病人的体内平衡因疾病而被破坏。
The experiment demonstrated how homeostasis is maintained. = 实验演示了体内平衡是如何维持的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied homeostasis for many years. = 科学家们已经研究体内平衡多年了。
Researchers have discovered new aspects of homeostasis. = 研究人员发现了体内平衡的新方面。


过去完成时:
Before the intervention, the patient's homeostasis had been severely compromised. = 在干预之前，病人的体内平衡已经严重受损。
The system had already begun to regain homeostasis by the time the treatment ended. = 到治疗结束时，系统已经开始恢复体内平衡。


将来时:
Future research will explore new methods of supporting homeostasis. = 未来的研究将探索支持体内平衡的新方法。
We will investigate how stress affects homeostasis. = 我们将研究压力如何影响体内平衡。


虚拟语气:
If the body didn't maintain homeostasis, we would not survive. = 如果身体不能维持体内平衡，我们就无法生存。
It is essential that homeostasis be maintained for optimal health. = 维持体内平衡对于最佳健康至关重要。


被动语态:
Homeostasis is maintained by a complex network of feedback loops. = 体内平衡由复杂的反馈回路网络维持。
The disruption of homeostasis was observed in the study. = 在这项研究中观察到了体内平衡的破坏。


疑问句:
How does the body maintain homeostasis? = 人体是如何维持体内平衡的？
What factors can disrupt homeostasis? = 哪些因素会破坏体内平衡？


否定句:
The lack of homeostasis can lead to illness. = 缺乏体内平衡会导致疾病。
The system did not maintain homeostasis effectively. = 系统未能有效维持体内平衡。


PHRASE->

maintain homeostasis = 维持体内平衡
disrupt homeostasis = 破坏体内平衡
regulate homeostasis = 调节体内平衡
homeostatic mechanisms = 体内平衡机制
homeostatic control = 体内平衡控制


词源:

From Greek *homoios* ("similar") + *stasis* ("standing").  The term was coined in the early 20th century to describe the biological principle of maintaining a stable internal environment.
