PHRASE->
Because "nonamenableness" is a relatively uncommon word, there aren't common phrases built around it.  Instead, phrases would use synonyms to convey similar meanings.  For example:

Phrase 1:  Dealing with the intractabilities of the situation. (处理情况的棘手之处)
Phrase 2:  Overcoming the recalcitrance of the witnesses. (克服证人的顽抗)
Phrase 3:  Addressing the unruliness of the students. (处理学生的不守规矩)
Phrase 4:  The difficulties of dealing with his uncooperativeness. (处理他不合作的困难)
Phrase 5:  The challenges posed by the system's inflexibility. (系统缺乏灵活性带来的挑战)


NOTE:  The word "nonamenableness" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "amenability," which means the willingness to cooperate or comply. The "-nesses" suffix creates a plural noun form.  Therefore, the word describes a state of multiple instances of lacking cooperation, compliance, or tractability.
