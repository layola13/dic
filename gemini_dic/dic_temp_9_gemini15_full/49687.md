词源: From "demiurge" + "-ous".  "Demiurge" itself comes from Greek  δημιουργός (dēmiourgós), meaning "craftsman," "artisan," or "public worker,"  from  δῆμος (dêmos) "people" + ἔργον (ergon) "work".  In Neoplatonism, the demiurge took on the specific meaning of a secondary creator, distinct from the ultimate, transcendent source of being.
