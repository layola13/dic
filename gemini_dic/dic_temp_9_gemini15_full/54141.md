词源:
The word "disengaged" comes from the verb "engage," meaning to participate or become involved.  The prefix "dis-" means "not" or "opposite of," therefore "disengaged" means "not engaged," indicating a lack of involvement or connection.  The root "engage" can be traced back to Old French "engager" and ultimately to Latin "in-" (in) + "ingredi" (to go or enter).
