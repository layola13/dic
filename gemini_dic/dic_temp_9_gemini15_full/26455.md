词源:
The word "byssus" comes from the Ancient Greek word βύσσος (byssos), which referred to a fine linen fabric.  Later, the word came to also describe the silky threads produced by mussels and other bivalves used to attach themselves to surfaces.  The Greek word's origins are uncertain, but some theories connect it to a Proto-Indo-European root related to flax or weaving.


用法说明:
The noun "byssus" is most commonly used to refer to the strong, silky threads produced by mussels and other bivalves to anchor themselves. In a less common usage, it can also refer to the fabric made from these threads, historically prized for its luxurious quality.  The word is primarily found in scientific and historical contexts, although its evocative imagery might occasionally appear in creative writing.
