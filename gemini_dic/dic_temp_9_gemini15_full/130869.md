nonarchitectures: /ˌnɒnˈɑːrkɪtɛktʃərz/ | n. | 非建筑；非建筑设计 |  The term "nonarchitectures" refers to spaces or structures that, while existing and functional, do not conform to traditional architectural design principles or aesthetics.  They might lack formal planning, be improvised, temporary, or otherwise defy conventional architectural categorization.  They often arise from necessity, improvisation, or the lack of formal architectural intervention.  The study of nonarchitectures can provide insights into how people inhabit and adapt spaces in unconventional ways. | Example:  The sprawling shantytowns of many developing cities are often cited as examples of nonarchitectures.  = 许多发展中国家的庞大贫民窟经常被认为是非建筑的例子。  The temporary structures erected for a music festival are another example of nonarchitecture. = 为音乐节搭建的临时建筑是另一个非建筑的例子。 | 近义词: informal structures, vernacular architecture, improvised spaces | 反义词: formal architecture, planned structures
