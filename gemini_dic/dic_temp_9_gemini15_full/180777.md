词源:

The word "regulator" comes from the verb "regulate," which is from the Late Latin word *regula, meaning "rule, straight edge," from the verb *regere, meaning "to rule, to direct, to keep straight."  The suffix "-ator" forms nouns of agency or instrumentality.  Therefore, "regulator" literally means "one that regulates" or "a device for regulating."
