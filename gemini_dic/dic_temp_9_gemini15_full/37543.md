词源：

* **common:**  From Old French *comun, *comune, from Latin *communis ("common, shared").  Meaning "ordinary, commonplace" developed later.

* **place:** From Old French *place, from Latin *platea ("broad street, public square").  The sense of "position, location" gave rise to figurative uses like "a place in society" and hence contributing to the idea of "commonplace" as something occupying a common or ordinary position.

* **-ly:**  A common adverbial suffix in English, indicating manner or state.
