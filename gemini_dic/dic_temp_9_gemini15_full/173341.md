词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," "almost," or "seemingly."

* **desolately**: From "desolate" (meaning deserted, empty, lonely) + "-ly" (adverbial suffix).  "Desolate" itself has roots in Latin *desolatus*, past participle of *desolare*, meaning "to lay waste," "to make desolate."

Therefore, "quasi-desolately" combines the sense of "almost" or "seemingly" with the feeling of desolation, resulting in a description of something that evokes a sense of emptiness and loneliness but not to the extreme degree of complete desolation.
