USAGE->
This word is a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "What is/was/will be..."  It describes an action (the act of re-endowing), so tenses apply to the *verb* describing the re-endowment, not the word itself.


Example sentences illustrating different tenses relating to the action of re-endowment:

Present Simple: The foundation makes reendowments annually. 基金会每年进行重新捐赠。
Present Continuous: The university is seeking reendowments to fund its new research center. 大学正在寻求重新捐赠以资助其新的研究中心。

Future Continuous: They will be making reendowments throughout the next fiscal year. 他们将在下一个财政年度进行重新捐赠。


Perfect tenses (present perfect, past perfect, future perfect) would also describe the *timing* of the re-endowment action, but the word "reendowments" itself remains a noun.

Example: The university has received significant reendowments this decade.  这十年来，大学收到了大量的重新捐赠。(Present Perfect)


Passive Voice: Reendowments were announced at the annual meeting.  在年度会议上宣布了重新捐赠。(Passive Voice)
