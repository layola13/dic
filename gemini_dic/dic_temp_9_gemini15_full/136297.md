词源：
The word "nonrepressible" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "repressible," which comes from the verb "repress" (to subdue or hold back).  The suffix "-ible" indicates something capable of being done. Therefore, "nonrepressible" literally means "not capable of being repressed."
