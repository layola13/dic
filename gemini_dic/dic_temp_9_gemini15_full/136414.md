This word is not commonly used. It's a rather artificial plural form built from "nonretentiveness," which itself is not a frequently used word.  The root is "retention," meaning the continued possession, control, or use of something.  Adding "non-" negates it.  Therefore, "nonretentivenesses" refers to multiple instances or aspects of a lack of retention, often in the context of memory.  There is no standard grammatical usage beyond its literal meaning as a plural noun.  It's more likely you would use phrases like "multiple instances of forgetfulness" or "memory deficits" instead.
