kenogenesis:/ˌkiːnoʊˈdʒɛnɪsɪs/| n. |新生演化；无效演化；非适应性演化|The evolutionary development of structures or characteristics that are not directly adaptive, often resulting in features that are seemingly useless or even detrimental to the organism.  Kenogenesis refers to evolutionary changes that are not driven by natural selection for adaptive traits, but rather by other factors such as genetic drift, developmental constraints, or phylogenetic inertia.  It often leads to the development of seemingly useless or even harmful traits.| Example: The elaborate plumage of some male birds, while attractive to females, may also make them more vulnerable to predators, representing a form of kenogenesis.  某些雄性鸟类的华丽羽毛，虽然对雌性有吸引力，但也可能使它们更容易受到捕食者的攻击，这是一种新生演化的表现。|近义词： atavism, neoteny |反义词：adaptation, natural selection |名词
