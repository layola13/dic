词源:  The name "lignoceric" is derived from "lignin," referring to the woody part of plants, and "-ceric," a suffix often used in fatty acid nomenclature.  The specific relationship between lignin and lignoceric acid is not direct, but the naming likely reflects the early isolation source of the acid.
