词源:
The word "cicerone" comes from the Italian word "cicerone," which in turn is derived from the name of the Roman statesman and orator Marcus Tullius Cicero (106-43 BC).  Cicero was known for his eloquence and his vast knowledge, and his name became associated with learned guides who could offer insightful commentary, much like Cicero himself would have.
