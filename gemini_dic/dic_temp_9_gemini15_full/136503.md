nonrotational: /ˌnɒnˌroʊteɪʃənəl/ | adj. | 非旋转的，无旋转的 | Not involving or characterized by rotation.  Describes something that doesn't rotate or spin. | Example: The nonrotational flow of the fluid ensured a smooth process.  非旋转的流体流动确保了一个平稳的过程。|近义词：stationary, fixed, non-spinning | 反义词：rotational, spinning, revolving


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The wheel is nonrotational. = 轮子是非旋转的。
The system remains nonrotational. = 系统保持非旋转状态。


一般过去时:
The engine was nonrotational during the test. = 在测试过程中，发动机是非旋转的。
The component stayed nonrotational throughout the experiment. = 在整个实验过程中，组件保持非旋转状态。


现在完成时:
The satellite has remained nonrotational since launch. = 自发射以来，卫星一直保持非旋转状态。
The experiment has shown that the fluid flow is nonrotational. = 实验表明流体流动是非旋转的。


过去完成时:
The rotor had been nonrotational before the power was applied. = 在施加电力之前，转子是非旋转的。
The system had remained nonrotational until the malfunction occurred. = 直到发生故障之前，系统一直保持非旋转状态。


将来时:
The device will remain nonrotational under normal operating conditions. = 在正常运行条件下，该设备将保持非旋转状态。
The experiment will demonstrate a nonrotational flow pattern. = 实验将演示一种非旋转的流动模式。


虚拟语气:
If the flow were nonrotational, the calculations would be simpler. = 如果流动是非旋转的，计算将更简单。
It is essential that the component remain nonrotational. = 组件必须保持非旋转状态。


被动语态:
The nonrotational state of the system was maintained. = 系统的非旋转状态得到了保持。
The flow was confirmed to be nonrotational. = 流动被证实是非旋转的。


疑问句:
Is the motion of the object nonrotational? = 物体的运动是非旋转的吗？
Is the fluid flow nonrotational in this scenario? = 在这种情况下，流体流动是非旋转的吗？


否定句:
The movement is not nonrotational; it's rotating rapidly. = 运动不是非旋转的；它正在快速旋转。
The system is not nonrotational under these conditions. = 在这些条件下，系统不是非旋转的。


PHRASE->
nonrotational flow = 非旋转流动
nonrotational field = 非旋转场
nonrotational motion = 非旋转运动
nonrotational strain = 非旋转应变
nonrotational symmetry = 非旋转对称性
