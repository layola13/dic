词源:
The word "overwhelming" comes from the verb "overwhelm," which is formed from the Old English prefix "ofer-" (over) and the verb "hwelmian" (to cover, to turn over, to submerge).  The sense of being overpowered or subdued is inherent in the original meaning.  The -ing suffix then transforms it into an adjective.
