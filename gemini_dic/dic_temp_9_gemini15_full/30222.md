celli: /ˈtʃɛli/ | n. | 纤维细胞 | A cell that produces and secretes the extracellular matrix of connective tissues.  It is involved in the synthesis and maintenance of the extracellular matrix, which provides structural support and a medium for cell-to-cell communication. |  Examples: Fibroblasts are a type of celli that contributes significantly to wound healing.  The celli in cartilage produce a specialized extracellular matrix that allows for flexibility and shock absorption.| 近义词：fibroblast,  chondrocyte (depending on context) | 反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The celli produce collagen. = 纤维细胞产生胶原蛋白。
These celli secrete extracellular matrix. = 这些细胞分泌细胞外基质。


一般过去时:
The celli synthesized new proteins. = 细胞合成了新的蛋白质。
The researchers examined the celli under a microscope. = 研究人员在显微镜下检查了细胞。


现在完成时:
