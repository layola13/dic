词源:  The word "freezabilities" is derived from the verb "freeze" (meaning to solidify by cold) and the suffix "-abilities," which indicates the capacity or potential for something.  The suffix "-able" means capable of being, and the addition of "-ities" makes it a noun referring to plural capacities or qualities.  Therefore, freezabilities refers to the various capacities or qualities related to the process of freezing.
