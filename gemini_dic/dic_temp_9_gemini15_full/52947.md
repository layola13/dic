The word "dinetical" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information. It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of another word.  If you could provide the context in which you encountered this word, it might be possible to guess the intended word.
* **A neologism:**  It might be a newly coined word, specific to a particular field or community.  Again, context is crucial.
* **A proper noun:** It might be a proper noun, a name or place name, that has not been included in standard dictionaries.

Without further information, a detailed analysis as requested is not feasible.
