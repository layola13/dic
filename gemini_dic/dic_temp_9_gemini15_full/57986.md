词源:

Drivel, as a verb meaning "to slaver," comes from the Middle English word *drivelen*, which likely originates from the Old Norse word *dreifa* meaning "to drive," "to drift," or "to scatter."  The sense of meaningless talk developed later, likely associating the uncontrolled flow of saliva with the uncontrolled flow of incoherent speech.  The noun sense of "nonsense" is a later development from the verb.
