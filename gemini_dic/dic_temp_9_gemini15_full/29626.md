catenarian:/ˌkætɪˈnɛəriən/| adj.|悬链线的；链状的|Relating to or resembling a catenary curve, a curve that an idealized flexible chain or cable assumes under its own weight when supported only at its ends.  The term often describes structures or forms that mimic this curve.|The bridge's elegant catenarian arch spanned the river gracefully.  这座桥优雅的悬链线拱桥优雅地跨越了河流。The hanging lights created a beautiful catenarian effect.  悬挂的灯创造了一个美丽的悬链线效果。|curvilinear, arched|straight, linear|形容词


USAGE->

Before construction, they had studied catenary properties extensively. = 在施工前，他们已经广泛研究了悬链线的特性。


将来时:
Future projects will likely utilize more catenary structures. = 未来的项目可能会更多地利用悬链线结构。
This design will showcase a unique catenarian form. = 此设计将展示独特的悬链线形式。


虚拟语气:
If the material were perfectly flexible, it would form a perfect catenary. = 如果材料完全柔韧，它将形成完美的悬链线。
I wish the bridge had a more pronounced catenarian curve. = 我希望这座桥有一个更明显的悬链线曲线。


被动语态:
The catenary curve was carefully calculated by the engineers. = 悬链线曲线由工程师仔细计算。
The catenarian design is being implemented in the new stadium. = 悬链线设计正在新的体育场中实施。


疑问句:
Is this structure based on a catenary principle? = 这个结构是基于悬链线原理吗？
Does the catenary curve change under different loads? = 悬链线曲线在不同的载荷下会改变吗？


否定句:
The bridge's form is not a true catenary. = 这座桥的形状不是真正的悬链线。
This design does not employ a catenarian arch. = 此设计不采用悬链线拱。
