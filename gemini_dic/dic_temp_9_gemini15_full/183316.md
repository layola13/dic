词源:
The word "reproach" comes from the Old French word "reprochier," which means "to bring near," "to upbraid," or "to rebuke."  The prefix "re-" indicates repetition or back, and the root likely relates to words suggesting closeness or proximity, implying bringing a fault close to someone's attention.  This evolved through Middle English.
