词源:

The word "proaristocracy" is a modern coinage combining:

* **pro-**:  A prefix meaning "in favor of," "supporting," or "advocating."
* **aristocracy**: From Ancient Greek *aristokratía* (ἀριστοκρατία), from *aristos* (ἄριστος) "best" + *kratos* (κράτος) "rule, power."  Thus, literally meaning "rule by the best."

Therefore, "proaristocracy" means supporting or favoring rule by the best (or, in practice, the elite).
