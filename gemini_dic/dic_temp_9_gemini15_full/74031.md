词源:
The word "forwent" is the past tense of "forgo," which itself comes from the Old English "forgān," meaning "to go without" or "to abstain from."  The prefix "for-" indicates negation or deprivation, similar to the prefix "fore-" in words like "forego." The "-go" element relates to the act of going or proceeding.
