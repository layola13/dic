词源:  The origin is uncertain, but it's likely a diminutive of an obsolete word related to "mop," possibly referring to a child's unkempt hair.  Some etymological sources suggest a possible connection to the Dutch word "mop," meaning "puppet" or "rag doll".  The meaning shifted over time to describe a small child.
