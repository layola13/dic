词源:
The word "moonstricken" is a compound word.  "Moon" refers to the celestial body, and "stricken" means "affected" or "attacked." The combination suggests an affliction or influence from the moon, historically linked to beliefs about lunar influence on mental states.  The "-stricken" suffix is common in English, deriving from the past participle of strong verbs, adding a sense of being affected by something.
