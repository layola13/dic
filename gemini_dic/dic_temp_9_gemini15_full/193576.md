词源:
The word "self-anointed" is a compound word.  "Self" means "of or by oneself." "Anointed" comes from the Old French word "oint," meaning "oiled" or "anointed," ultimately derived from the Latin "unguere," meaning "to anoint."  Historically, anointing with oil was a ritual act of bestowing authority or sacred status upon a person, particularly a king or religious leader.  Therefore, "self-anointed" implies someone who has bestowed this authority upon themselves, without the traditional ritual or legitimate authority.
