词源:  The word "minidepressions" is a compound word.  "Mini" is a prefix meaning "small" or "miniature," derived from Latin "minimus" (smallest).  "Depressions" is a noun referring to sunken or hollow areas, derived from the verb "depress," ultimately from Latin "de-" (down) and "premere" (to press). Therefore, "minidepressions" literally means "small depressions."
