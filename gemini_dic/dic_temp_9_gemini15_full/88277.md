The word "hintenborg" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or any widely recognized language.  It's likely a proper noun (possibly a surname or place name), a misspelling, or a word from a fictional language.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  To provide the requested information, I need a valid word.
