The word "faddies" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a regional dialect word, or a newly coined term.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need more context on where you encountered this word.  Knowing the source will allow me to better understand its meaning and provide a more accurate analysis.
