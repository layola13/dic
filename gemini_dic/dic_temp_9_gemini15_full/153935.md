The word "peregrinities" is derived from the Latin word "peregrinatio," which means "travel abroad," "wandering," or "pilgrimage."  The suffix "-ities" indicates a state or quality.  Therefore, "peregrinities" refers to the state or quality of being involved in extensive travel or wandering, often with the connotation of exploration and discovery.
