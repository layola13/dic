词源:
The word "nonsoberly" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adverb "soberly."  "Soberly" comes from the adjective "sober," which ultimately derives from Old French "sobre" and ultimately from Latin "sobrius," meaning "temperate, moderate, self-controlled."  Therefore, "nonsoberly" signifies the opposite of a sober or serious demeanor.
