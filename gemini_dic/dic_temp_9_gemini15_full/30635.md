The word "ceremoniousness" derives from the adjective "ceremonious," which in turn comes from the noun "ceremony."  "Ceremony" traces its origins back to the Old French word "ceremonie," ultimately stemming from the Latin word "caerimonia,"  meaning "sacred rite," "religious observance," or "mystery."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun indicating a quality or state.
