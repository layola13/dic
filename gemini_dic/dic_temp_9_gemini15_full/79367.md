词源:

The word "glucometer" is a blend of "glucose" and "meter."  "Glucose" comes from the French word "glucose," ultimately derived from the Greek word  γλυκύς (glukus) meaning "sweet." "Meter" comes from the Greek word  μέτρον (metron) meaning "measure."  Therefore, glucometer literally means "a device that measures glucose".
