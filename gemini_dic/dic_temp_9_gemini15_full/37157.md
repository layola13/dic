词源:
The phrasal verb "come to terms" originates from the older meaning of "terms" referring to conditions or stipulations in an agreement.  The "come to" part signifies the process of reaching or arriving at these conditions. The evolution of its meaning to include accepting reality reflects a natural extension of the idea of agreement to encompass a broader sense of reconciliation.
