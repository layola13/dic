词源:

The word "hostage" comes from the Old French word "ostage," meaning "pledge" or "guarantee."  This in turn derives from the Old Norse word "veðja," meaning "to pledge" or "to bet."  The original concept of a hostage was someone given as a guarantee of good faith or to ensure the fulfillment of an agreement.
