词源:

The word "hail" in this phrase derives from the Old English word "hālan," meaning "to drag, pull, fetch."  Over time, its meaning evolved to encompass "to greet, salute," and later, "to come from," especially regarding origins.  The "from" part is a simple preposition indicating origin or source.  The combination creates a more idiomatic and descriptive expression than simply "comes from."
