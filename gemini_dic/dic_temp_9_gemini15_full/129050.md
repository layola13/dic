nitrification:/ˌnaɪtrɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/ | n. |硝化作用|The biological oxidation of ammonia to nitrite followed by the oxidation of the nitrite to nitrate.  This is an important process in the nitrogen cycle, carried out by specific bacteria in soil and water. |Example: Nitrification is crucial for making nitrogen available to plants. 硝化作用对于使氮可用于植物至关重要。|近义词：nitrogen oxidation |反义词：denitrification

词源:
The word "nitrification" comes from the Latin word "nitrum" (meaning "nitre" or "saltpeter"), referring to nitrates, and the suffix "-fication," meaning "the process of making or becoming."  Therefore, "nitrification" literally means "the process of making nitrates."
