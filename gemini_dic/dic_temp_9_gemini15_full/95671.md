* **conceivable:**  adjective meaning capable of being imagined or believed.  This comes from:
    * **con-:** prefix indicating together or completely.
    * **ceive:** verb meaning to form or have in the mind; to understand or grasp. This traces back to the Latin *capere* "to take, seize."
* **-ness:** suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.
