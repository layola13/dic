词源:  The word "fretful" comes from the Old English word "fretan," meaning "to eat away," "to corrode," or "to devour."  This refers to the gnawing anxiety and irritation that characterize a fretful state. Over time, the meaning shifted to describe the emotional state itself, rather than the physical process.

fretful 通常用来形容人（特别是婴儿或儿童），有时也可形容动物或情况。它强调的是一种持续的、轻微的烦躁，而不是突发的愤怒。
