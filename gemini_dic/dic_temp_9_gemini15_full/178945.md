词源:
The word "redecisions" is a combination of "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") and "decisions."  It's a relatively modern word formed through the natural process of combining existing word parts to express a new concept. There's no specific historical etymology tracing back to ancient roots like some older words, as its meaning is clearly derived from its component parts.
