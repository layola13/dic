Etymology:  The word "glue-like" is a compound adjective formed from the noun "glue" and the suffix "-like," which means "resembling" or "having the characteristics of."  "Glue" itself originates from the Old English word "glu," meaning "glue" or "birdlime" (a sticky substance used to trap birds).  The "-like" suffix is of Germanic origin.
