词源:
The word "represent" comes from the Old French word "representer," which in turn comes from the Latin word "representare," meaning "to present again," "to exhibit," or "to portray."  The prefix "re-" means "again," and the root "-presentare" comes from "prae-" (before) and "esse" (to be). Therefore, the original meaning implied a re-presentation or a showing of something already existing.
