non-dissipative: /ˌnɒn dɪˈsɪpətɪv/ | adj. | 非耗散的；无耗散的 | Not involving or causing the dissipation of energy.  A non-dissipative system does not lose energy over time.  | Example: The ideal pendulum is a non-dissipative system.  理想的摆是一个非耗散系统。

The frictionless motion of an object is a non-dissipative process. 物体的无摩擦运动是一个非耗散过程。| 近义词: conservative, lossless | 反义词: dissipative


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The system is non-dissipative. = 系统是非耗散的。
This process remains non-dissipative under ideal conditions. = 在理想条件下，此过程保持非耗散性。


一般过去时:
The experiment showed the system was non-dissipative. = 实验表明系统是非耗散的。
The results indicated that the process was non-dissipative. = 结果表明该过程是非耗散的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have confirmed that the system has remained non-dissipative. = 科学家们已经证实该系统一直保持非耗散性。
We have observed that the energy has not been dissipated; the system is non-dissipative. = 我们观察到能量没有耗散；系统是非耗散的。


过去完成时:
Before the perturbation, the system had been non-dissipative. = 在扰动之前，系统一直是非耗散的。
They had assumed the process was non-dissipative, but later found evidence to the contrary. = 他们曾假设该过程是非耗散的，但后来发现了相反的证据。


将来时:
The simulation predicts that the system will be non-dissipative. = 模拟预测系统将是非耗散的。
We expect that the process will remain non-dissipative. = 我们预计该过程将保持非耗散性。


虚拟语气:
If the system were non-dissipative, the results would be different. = 如果系统是非耗散的，结果将会不同。
It would be ideal if the process could be kept completely non-dissipative. = 如果该过程能够保持完全非耗散性，那就最好了。


被动语态:
The non-dissipative nature of the system was demonstrated. = 系统的非耗散性得到了证明。
The process was assumed to be non-dissipative. = 该过程被认为是非耗散的。


疑问句:
Is the system non-dissipative? = 系统是非耗散的吗？
Is this a non-dissipative process? = 这是一个非耗散过程吗？


否定句:
The system is not non-dissipative; it loses energy over time. = 该系统并非非耗散的；它会随着时间推移而损失能量。
The process is not entirely non-dissipative due to frictional losses. = 由于摩擦损失，该过程并非完全非耗散的。


PHRASE->
non-dissipative system 非耗散系统
non-dissipative process 非耗散过程
non-dissipative dynamics 非耗散动力学
non-dissipative Hamiltonian 非耗散哈密顿量
non-dissipative force 非耗散力

词源:
The word "non-dissipative" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "dissipative," which is derived from the verb "dissipate" (to disperse or scatter).  "Dissipate" itself comes from the Latin word "dissipare," meaning "to scatter."  Therefore, "non-dissipative" literally means "not scattering" or "not dispersing" (energy).
