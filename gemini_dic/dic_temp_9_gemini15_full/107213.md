词源:

The word "laid-backness" is derived from the adjective "laid-back."  "Laid-back" itself is a relatively modern idiom, originating in American English in the mid-20th century.  The "laid" part comes from the past participle of the verb "to lay,"  but in this context, it doesn't have its literal meaning of placing something down. Instead, it implies a relaxed and reclined posture, suggesting a state of ease and unconcern.  The "back" simply reinforces the idea of relaxation and leaning back. The "-ness" suffix is added to transform the adjective into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being laid-back.
