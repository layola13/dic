pseudogenus:/ˈsuːdoʊdʒɪnəs/| n. |假基因；伪基因|A pseudogene is a non-functional gene; it is a DNA sequence that resembles a gene but has lost its protein-coding ability or is otherwise no longer expressed.  Pseudogenes arise from mutations that disable a functional gene, or from gene duplication followed by the accumulation of mutations in the duplicated copy.  They can provide valuable insights into evolutionary history and gene function.| Example:  The researchers identified several pseudogenes in the genome of the newly discovered species.  研究人员在新发现物种的基因组中发现了几个假基因。|近义词: inactive gene, vestigial gene |反义词: functional gene, active gene


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The pseudogene remains inactive. = 假基因保持不活跃状态。
This research focuses on pseudogene identification. = 这项研究侧重于假基因的鉴定。


一般过去时:
Scientists discovered a new pseudogene. = 科学家发现了一个新的假基因。
The mutation deactivated the gene, turning it into a pseudogene. = 突变使基因失活，将其转变为假基因。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified many pseudogenes. = 研究人员已经鉴定了许多假基因。
The study has shown the evolution of this pseudogene. = 这项研究展示了这个假基因的进化过程。


过去完成时:
Before the mutation, the gene had been functional.  = 在突变之前，该基因是功能性的。
They had already analyzed the pseudogene sequence. = 他们已经分析了假基因序列。


将来时:
Scientists will analyze more pseudogenes. = 科学家将分析更多的假基因。
Future research will focus on the functions of pseudogenes. = 未来的研究将集中在假基因的功能上。


虚拟语气:
If this gene were a pseudogene, it would not be expressed. = 如果这个基因是假基因，它就不会表达。
It is as if this gene had become a pseudogene. = 就好像这个基因已经变成了假基因。


被动语态:
The pseudogene was identified through sequencing. = 通过测序鉴定了该假基因。
Many pseudogenes are being studied. = 许多假基因正在被研究。


疑问句:
Is this sequence a pseudogene? = 这个序列是假基因吗？
What is the origin of this pseudogene? = 这个假基因的起源是什么？


否定句:
This gene is not a pseudogene. = 这个基因不是假基因。
The study did not find any new pseudogenes. = 这项研究没有发现任何新的假基因。


PHRASE->
pseudogene evolution  假基因进化
pseudogene annotation 假基因注释
