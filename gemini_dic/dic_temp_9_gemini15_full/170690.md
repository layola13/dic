pseudoalveolar: /ˌsuːdoʊælˈviːələr/ | adj. | 准齿龈音的 |  Describing sounds produced with the tongue near, but not touching, the alveolar ridge (the gum ridge behind the upper teeth).  These sounds are often considered transitional between alveolar and palatal sounds.  The exact articulation varies depending on the language and specific sound. | Example:  The English sound /ʃ/ (as in "ship") is often described as a postalveolar fricative, while some linguists classify it as a pseudoalveolar.  | 近义词: postalveolar, near-alveolar | 反义词:  None (It describes a position, not a quality with inherent opposites)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The sound /ʃ/ is considered pseudoalveolar by some linguists. = 一些语言学家认为/ʃ/音是准齿龈音。
This phoneme is generally classified as pseudoalveolar. = 这个音素通常被归类为准齿龈音。


一般过去时:
Linguists previously debated the classification of /ʃ/. = 语言学家以前就/ʃ/音的分类有过争论。
The phoneme was initially identified as an alveolar sound. = 这个音素最初被认为是齿龈音。


现在完成时:
Research has shown the complexities of pseudoalveolar articulation. = 研究表明了准齿龈音发音的复杂性。

过去完成时:
Before the refined classification, the sound was misidentified. = 在分类完善之前，这个音被误认为是其他音。
They had not yet distinguished pseudoalveolar sounds from alveolar ones. = 他们那时还没有区分准齿龈音和齿龈音。


将来时:
Further studies will clarify the acoustic properties of pseudoalveolar sounds. = 进一步的研究将阐明准齿龈音的声学特性。
We will analyze the articulatory gestures involved in producing these sounds. = 我们将分析产生这些声音时所涉及的发音动作。


虚拟语气:
If the sound were truly alveolar, it would have different acoustic characteristics. = 如果这个声音确实是齿龈音，它就会有不同的声学特性。
I wish I understood the nuances of pseudoalveolar articulation better. = 我希望我能更好地理解准齿龈音发音的细微之处。


被动语态:
The sound /ʃ/ is often described as pseudoalveolar in phonetic literature. = 在语音文献中，/ʃ/音常被描述为准齿龈音。
The classification of this sound has been debated for many years. = 这个声音的分类多年来一直存在争议。


疑问句:
Is the /ʒ/ sound also considered pseudoalveolar? = /ʒ/音也被认为是准齿龈音吗？
Where does the tongue precisely contact during pseudoalveolar articulation? = 在准齿龈音发音中，舌头精确地接触在哪里？


否定句:
The /t/ sound is not a pseudoalveolar sound; it's alveolar. = /t/音不是准齿龈音；它是齿龈音。
This particular phoneme isn't classified as pseudoalveolar by all linguists. = 这个特定的音素并非所有语言学家都将其归类为准齿龈音。
