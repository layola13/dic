The word "pretries" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  To get a proper analysis, please provide the correct spelling of the word you intended.
