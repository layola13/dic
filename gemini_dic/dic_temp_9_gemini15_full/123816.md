mopsical:/ˈmɒpsɪkəl/| adj.|邋遢的，不整洁的，凌乱的|  This word is not found in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a newly coined word, a misspelling, or a word from a very niche dialect or context.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and usage examples are impossible to provide.  The word might be a blend or alteration of words related to "mop" (suggesting dampness or messiness) and possibly another word contributing to the "-ical" suffix,  creating an adjectival form.  Without further context or information about its origin, any further analysis would be speculative. |No examples available.|No synonyms or antonyms available.|adjective
