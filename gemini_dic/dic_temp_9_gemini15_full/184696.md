resublimate:/ˌriːˈsʌblɪmeɪt/| vt.|再升华；再次升华|To sublimate again; to undergo sublimation a second time.  The process involves the transition of a substance directly from the solid to the gaseous phase, and then back to the solid phase, without passing through an intermediate liquid phase.|例句：The chemist attempted to resublimate the purified compound to remove any remaining impurities. 化学家试图再次升华纯化后的化合物以去除任何残留的杂质。

The process of resublimation is often used in purification techniques to obtain highly pure substances.  再次升华过程通常用于提纯技术以获得高纯度物质。|近义词：resublime, purify, refine|反义词：melt, liquefy
