词源:
The word "cowardice" comes from the Old French word "cohardise," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "coart," meaning "tail."  The connection is likely due to the image of a dog with its tail between its legs, symbolizing fear and submission.  The suffix "-ice" indicates a quality or state.
