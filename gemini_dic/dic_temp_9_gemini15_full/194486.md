词源:  The word is a compound of "self-" (oneself) and "reverent" (showing deep respect).  The ironic use of "reverent" (typically used for respect towards something holy or sacred) highlights the inappropriateness of the excessive self-regard.  The word evolved from the combination of these two elements to describe a specific type of self-regard that borders on arrogance.
