pro-Oriental: /ˌproʊ ɔːriˈɛntəl/ | adj. | 亲东方/亲亚洲的 | Favoring or supporting the Orient (East Asia) and its people and culture.  This term is now largely considered outdated and potentially offensive due to its inherent bias and colonial connotations.  It implies a hierarchical relationship between the West and the East, often romanticizing or exoticizing Eastern cultures.
