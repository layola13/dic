词源:  Derived from the adjective "lost," meaning separated from one's usual surroundings or lacking a sense of direction or purpose. The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality.  The word's evolution reflects a gradual shift from a purely physical state of being lost to encompass a more profound emotional and existential sense of being adrift.
