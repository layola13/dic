词源:
The word "requite" comes from the Old French word "requiter," which means "to requite, recompense, repay."  This in turn derives from the Old French prefix "re-" (again) and the verb "quiter," meaning "to quit, leave, release." The original sense was more of a "releasing" or "settling" of a debt or obligation, which evolved to encompass the sense of repayment, whether good or bad.
