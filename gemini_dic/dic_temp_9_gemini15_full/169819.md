词源:  From Middle English *proscription, from Old French proscriptioun, from Latin proscriptio, from pro- ("forth," "forward") + scribere ("to write").  The original sense referred to a formal listing of those who were outlawed or condemned to death.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass any formal prohibition.
