词源:
The word "greengage" comes from the French word "reine Claude," which translates to "Queen Claude." This refers to Claude of France, the wife of Francis I, who was a great lover of this particular type of plum.  Over time, "reine Claude" evolved into "greengage" in English, with the "green" referring to the unripe fruit's color.
