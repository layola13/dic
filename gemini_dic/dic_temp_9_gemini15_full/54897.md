词源:
The word "disport" comes from the Old French word "desporter," which means "to carry away," "to divert," or "to amuse."  The prefix "dis-" suggests separation or dispersal, implying a scattering or playful movement.  The root "-port" comes from the Latin "portare," meaning "to carry."  Therefore, the original sense of "disport" is linked to the idea of carrying oneself away in amusement or play.
