词源:  The word "light-footedly" is formed from the adverbial suffix "-ly" added to the adjective "light-footed".  "Light" refers to being of little weight or easily carried, and "footed" relates to the feet and how one moves.  The combination describes a manner of movement characterized by lightness and grace.  The etymology traces back to Old English "līht" (light) and "fōt" (foot).
