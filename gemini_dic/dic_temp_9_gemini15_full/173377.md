/ˈkwɑːziˌdʌbli/ | adj. | 准双重的，近似双重的 |  Quasi-doubly describes something that almost or partially exhibits the characteristics of something doubly. It indicates a near duplication or a resemblance to a doubled structure or function, but not a perfect or complete one.  The prefix "quasi" means "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent."  It suggests an incomplete or imperfect similarity. | The algorithm has a quasi-doubly linked list structure, meaning some nodes lack full bidirectional links.  | near-doubly, almost doubly |  singly, simply |

USAGE->

一般现在时:
The system exhibits quasi-doubly linked behavior. = 系统表现出准双重链接行为。
This process shows quasi-doubly characteristics in its execution. = 此过程在执行中显示准双重特性。


一般过去时:
The research demonstrated quasi-doubly properties in the data. = 研究证明了数据中的准双重特性。
The earlier model possessed a quasi-doubly architecture. = 早期模型拥有准双重架构。


现在完成时:
Scientists have observed quasi-doubly patterns in numerous experiments. = 科学家们在许多实验中观察到准双重模式。
The team has developed a quasi-doubly efficient algorithm. = 该团队已经开发出一种准双重高效算法。


过去完成时:
They had anticipated a quasi-doubly response, but the results differed. = 他们曾预料到准双重响应，但结果有所不同。
Before the update, the software had a quasi-doubly data structure. = 更新之前，软件具有准双重数据结构。


将来时:
Future versions will likely include a fully doubly, not just quasi-doubly, system. = 未来版本可能会包含一个完全双重，而不仅仅是准双重的系统。
The project will aim to achieve a truly doubly, rather than quasi-doubly, effect. = 该项目的目标是实现真正双重，而不是准双重的效果。


虚拟语气:
If it were a truly doubly linked list, the operation would be faster. = 如果它是一个真正的双重链接列表，操作速度会更快。
I wish the design were less quasi-doubly and more efficient. = 我希望设计不那么准双重，效率更高。


被动语态:
A quasi-doubly linked list was implemented for optimal performance in specific cases. = 在特定情况下，为了获得最佳性能，实现了准双重链接列表。
The quasi-doubly nature of the problem was highlighted in the report. = 报告中强调了该问题的准双重性质。


疑问句:
Is this a truly doubly linked list, or is it merely quasi-doubly? = 这是一个真正的双重链接列表，还是仅仅是准双重的？
Does the new algorithm use a quasi-doubly approach? = 新算法是否使用了准双重方法？


否定句:
The system is not truly doubly linked; it's quasi-doubly. = 该系统不是真正的双重链接；它是准双重的。
The results did not show a purely doubly effect, only a quasi-doubly one. = 结果没有显示纯粹的双重效果，只有准双重效果。
