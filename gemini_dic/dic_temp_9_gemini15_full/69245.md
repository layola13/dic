词源:
The word "feasted" comes from the Old English word "fēstan," meaning "to observe a religious fast," which seems contradictory.  However, the meaning evolved.  The earlier meaning referred to a period of abstinence, but in time, "feast" came to refer to a period of abundant food and celebration, often following a period of fasting.  This shift is reflected in modern usage, where "feast" describes a lavish meal.
