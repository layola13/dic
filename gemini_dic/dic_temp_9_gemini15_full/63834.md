epigenetics:/ˌɛpɪdʒɛˈnɛtɪks/ | n. |表观遗传学 | The study of changes in organisms caused by modification of gene expression rather than alteration of the genetic code itself.  It refers to heritable changes in gene activity and expression that do not involve alterations to the underlying DNA sequence. | Epigenetics plays a crucial role in development and disease. |近义词：epigenetic regulation, gene expression modification |反义词：genetics (in the context of DNA sequence changes)
