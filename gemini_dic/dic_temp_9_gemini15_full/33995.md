This request is impossible to fulfill.  The provided format is designed for a single word, but "{cite's}" is not a single word; it's a contraction of "cite is" or possibly a possessive form of "cite".  To analyze it, we need to break it down into its component parts.


**Analysis of "cite's"**

"Cite's" is not a standard dictionary entry. It's a combination of two words:

* **Cite:** /saɪt/ | verb | 引用；提及 | To quote (a passage, book, author, etc.), especially as evidence or authority.  |  *Example:* She cited several studies to support her argument.  她引用了几项研究来支持她的论点。 |  近义词：quote, mention, refer to | 反义词：omit, ignore |  词性：Verb


* **'s:** This is a possessive suffix, indicating ownership or belonging.

Therefore, "cite's" likely means either "cite is" (in a contracted form, common in informal writing or speech) or "the cite belonging to someone/something".  The latter is less common and requires context to understand.


Because "cite's" is not a single lexical unit, providing a full analysis using the requested format is inappropriate.  The analysis should instead focus on "cite" and then consider how the addition of the possessive affects its meaning within a specific sentence.


To demonstrate, here's how we could analyze "cite" using the provided format, followed by examples of how "'s" would alter the meaning:


**Cite:**

/saɪt/ | verb | 引用；提及 | To quote (a passage, book, author, etc.), especially as evidence or authority. | *Example 1:* The professor cited Shakespeare in his lecture.  教授在他的讲座中引用了莎士比亚。  | *Example 2:*  The report cited a significant increase in sales. 报告指出销售额大幅增长。| 近义词：quote, mention, refer to | 反义词：omit, ignore | 词性：Verb



**Usage of "cite's" (depending on context):**

**1. "cite is" (contraction):** This is informal and should be avoided in formal writing.  Example: "The cite's a good source." (should be "The citation is a good source.")

**2. Possessive "cite's":**  This is rare and its meaning depends heavily on the context.  For example: "The cite's accuracy was questioned."  (meaning: The accuracy of the citation was questioned.)


I cannot provide a full grammatical analysis in the requested format because "cite's" is not a standard word with a consistent grammatical function.  Its meaning and usage are derived from combining the verb "cite" with the possessive apostrophe-s.
