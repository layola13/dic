词源:

Singability is a relatively modern word, formed by adding the suffix "-ability" (meaning "capable of being") to the verb "sing".  The suffix "-ability" is derived from the Latin suffix "-abilitas", ultimately relating to the Latin verb "esse" (to be).  Therefore, singability literally means "capable of being sung".
