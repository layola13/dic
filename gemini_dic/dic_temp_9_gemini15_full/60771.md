词源:
The word "electrolyzation" is derived from "electrolysis"  by adding the suffix "-ation", which indicates a process or action. "Electrolysis" itself is a combination of "electro-" (relating to electricity) and "-lysis" (a loosening or dissolving).  Therefore, electrolyzation signifies the process of using electricity to cause a chemical decomposition or change.
