词源:

The word "professionalization" is derived from the word "professional," which itself comes from the Middle English word "professione,"  ultimately from the Latin "professio," meaning "declaration," "avowal," or "open acknowledgment."  The suffix "-ization" indicates the process of becoming or making something.  Thus, "professionalization" describes the process of transforming something into a profession or adopting professional characteristics.
