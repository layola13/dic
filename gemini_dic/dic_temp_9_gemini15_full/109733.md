词源:
The word "leverage" originates from the Old French word "lever," meaning "to raise" or "to lift."  This refers to the mechanical advantage gained by using a lever.  The modern meaning, referring to influence or advantage, developed later, drawing on the original mechanical sense of applying force to achieve a greater effect.
