词源:
The word "dinter" is a relatively new and informal word.  It's likely a blend or a playful alteration of "dinner" to emphasize the informal and smaller scale of the gathering. There's no established etymological record tracing it back to older roots like many other words.  Its usage reflects a modern trend in language to create shorter, more casual versions of existing words.
