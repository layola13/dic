词源:  The word is a combination of "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partially") and "realistic" (relating to realism, a style emphasizing accurate representation of life).  "Realistic" ultimately derives from "real" (meaning "actual" or "existing") + "-istic" (a suffix forming adjectives).


用法说明:

semirealistic is primarily used as an adjective to describe things that are not entirely realistic but possess some degree of realism.  It's often used to describe art, literature, simulations, video games, or other representations of reality.  The level of realism is subjective and depends on the context.
