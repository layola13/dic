词源:

The word is a combination of "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partially") and "cultured" (referring to a state of refinement, education, and sophistication).  The "cultured" part derives from the Latin word "cultura," meaning "cultivation" or "tillage," which extended to the cultivation of the mind and spirit.
