Word Origin:

The word is a combination of:

* **quasi-**:  A prefix of Latin origin meaning "as if," "seemingly," or "apparently."
* **faithfully**: An adverb derived from "faithful," meaning "loyal, true, accurate."


Therefore, "quasi-faithfully" means acting in a manner that is *almost* but not perfectly faithful or true to the original.
