photostability: /ˌfoʊtoʊsteɪˈbɪləti/ | n. | 光稳定性 | The ability of a substance to resist degradation or alteration by light.  Photostability is crucial in many applications, particularly in the pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, where products must maintain their effectiveness and safety over time when exposed to light.  | Example:  The photostability of this new sunscreen is being rigorously tested. 这款新型防晒霜的光稳定性正在接受严格测试。  The drug's poor photostability led to its failure in clinical trials. 该药物的光稳定性差导致其临床试验失败。 | 近义词：light stability, resistance to light degradation | 反义词：photosensitivity, light instability
