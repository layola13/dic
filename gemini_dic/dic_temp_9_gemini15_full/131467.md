词源:

The word "noncoherent" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "coherent."  "Coherent" comes from the Latin word "cohaerēre," which means "to stick together," "to cling," or "to be connected."  This Latin root emphasizes the idea of unity and connection.  Therefore, "noncoherent" directly opposes this idea, signifying a lack of connection or unity.
