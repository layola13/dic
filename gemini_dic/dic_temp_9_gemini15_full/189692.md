salpa:/ˈsælpə/| n.|樽海鞘|A salpa is a barrel-shaped, planktonic tunicate.  They are free-swimming marine invertebrates that often form large chains. They are filter feeders and play a role in the marine food web.|Example:  Scientists are studying the salpa's role in carbon sequestration.|近义词：tunicate|反义词：N/A

一般过去时:
Researchers observed a large chain of salpas. = 研究人员观察到一大群樽海鞘。
The salpa population declined after the storm. = 暴风雨过后，樽海鞘的数量减少了。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied salpas for many years. = 科学家们已经研究樽海鞘多年了。
The ocean current has transported the salpas across vast distances. = 洋流将樽海鞘输送到了很远的地方。


过去完成时:
Before the research began, little was known about salpa genetics. = 在研究开始之前，人们对樽海鞘的遗传学知之甚少。
The salpas had already formed chains before the observation. = 在观察之前，樽海鞘已经形成了链状。
