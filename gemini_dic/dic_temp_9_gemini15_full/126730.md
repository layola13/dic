USAGE->
This word, being a possessive pronoun, doesn't conjugate in the same way as verbs.  Its usage is dependent on the noun it modifies.  There are no tenses involved.  It always indicates possession.

例句1: That's Nan's book.  那是南的书。
例句2:  Nan's house is beautiful. 南的房子很漂亮。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "nan's" as it is a possessive pronoun and functions grammatically within a larger phrase.  The word itself acts as a possessive determiner, modifying nouns.  Examples would be constructed around the noun it modifies, not around "nan's" itself.
