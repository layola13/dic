USAGE->

This word is primarily used in literary criticism and narratology, not in everyday conversation.  Therefore, providing examples across various tenses doesn't make sense in the same way it does for a common verb or noun.  Instead, let's illustrate different aspects of focalization:

Internal Focalization:
The story is told from the perspective of a character within the narrative.
Example:  The reader only knows what the protagonist sees and feels.  读者只能知道主人公所见所感。

External Focalization:
The narrator describes events without access to the characters' thoughts or feelings.
Example:  The narrative simply reports actions and dialogue, without revealing inner lives. 叙事只是简单地报道行动和对话，而不揭示内心的生活。

Zero Focalization:
The narrator has access to the thoughts and feelings of all characters. (Often associated with omniscient narration)
Example: The narrator knows the motivations of every character involved in the plot.  叙述者知道参与情节的每个角色的动机。

Variable Focalization:
The perspective shifts between different characters throughout the narrative.
Example: The novel shifts its focalization from the child's perspective in one chapter to the mother's in another. 这部小说将视角从一章中的孩子的视角转移到另一章中的母亲的视角。

Multiple Focalization:
Multiple perspectives are presented simultaneously or interwoven.
Example: The film uses multiple focalizations to create a complex and ambiguous narrative. 这部电影采用多种焦点化来创造一个复杂而模糊的叙事。
