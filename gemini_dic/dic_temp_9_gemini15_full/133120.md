词源：The word "nonesoteric" is a modern coinage, combining the prefix "non-" (from Latin, meaning "not") with "esoteric" (from Greek  ἐσωτερικός (ēsōterikós), meaning "inner," "internal").  "Esoteric" itself has a long history, tracing back to ancient Greek philosophical schools where certain teachings were reserved for initiates only.
