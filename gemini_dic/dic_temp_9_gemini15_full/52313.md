词源:
The word "dicker" originates from the Middle Dutch word "dikkeren," which meant "to thicken" or "to make thick."  Its transition to meaning "to bargain" likely arose from the idea of "thickening" or "padding" a price or deal.  The word's development also shows influence from the Middle High German "dickeren," which had similar meanings related to thickness and bargaining.
