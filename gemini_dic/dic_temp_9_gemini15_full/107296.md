lamaists:/ˈlɑːmeɪsts/| n. |喇嘛教徒，藏传佛教徒 |Followers of Lamaism, a form of Buddhism prevalent in Tibet and Mongolia.  The term is often considered outdated and potentially offensive, as it's a Western categorization that can be seen as implying a monolithic religious practice.  It's preferable to use more specific and respectful terms like "Tibetan Buddhists" or "followers of Tibetan Buddhism." |The lamaists held a grand prayer ceremony.  喇嘛教徒举行了一场盛大的祈祷仪式。|Tibetan Buddhists, followers of Tibetan Buddhism |(no direct antonym, but terms like "followers of other Buddhist traditions" or "non-Buddhists" could be used in contrast) |名词
