The word "{irre}" is not a standalone word in English.  It's a bound morpheme, a prefix that means "not" or "without."  It's always attached to another word to create a new word with the opposite meaning. Therefore, it cannot be analyzed as a word with its own pronunciation, grammatical function, or usage examples in the same way as "hello" or "what."  To analyze it, we need to look at examples of words it forms.  Here are some examples demonstrating its use and the resulting word's analysis:


**Examples:**

* **Irreplaceable:** /ˌɪrɪˈpleɪsəbəl/ | adj. | 不可替代的 |  Something irreplaceable is impossible to replace with something else of equal value.  | Example: The painting is irreplaceable; it's a national treasure.  = 这幅画是无价之宝，不可替代。 | Near Synonyms: essential, invaluable | Antonyms: replaceable, substitutable |


* **Irreversible:** /ˌɪrɪˈvɜːrsəbəl/ | adj. | 不可逆转的 |  An irreversible process cannot be undone or reversed. | Example:  The damage to the environment is irreversible. = 对环境的破坏是不可逆转的。 | Near Synonyms: permanent, irreparable | Antonyms: reversible, changeable |


* **Irregular:** /ɪˈreɡjələr/ | adj. | 不规则的 | Not conforming to a rule, standard, or pattern. | Example: The verb "to be" has irregular conjugations. = 动词“to be”的词形变化是不规则的。 | Near Synonyms: abnormal, atypical | Antonyms: regular, normal |


* **Irrelevant:** /ɪˈrelɪvənt/ | adj. | 不相关的 | Not connected with or relevant to something. | Example: Your opinion is irrelevant to this discussion. = 你的意见与本次讨论无关。 | Near Synonyms: immaterial, inconsequential | Antonyms: relevant, pertinent |



**Etymology:**

The prefix "ir-" is a combination of "in-" (meaning "not") and "r-". The "r-" is a result of assimilation – a phonetic process where a sound changes to become more similar to a neighboring sound.  In this case, the "in-" changes to "ir-" before words beginning with "r".


**Usage Notes:**

Because "irre" is a prefix, it doesn't have its own usage patterns. Its usage is entirely dependent on the word it modifies.  The grammatical function and tense of the resulting word follow standard English grammatical rules.  For example, "irreplaceable" is an adjective and can be used in various sentence structures.

There is no need for separate sections on tense, voice, or mood for the prefix "irre" as it's a bound morpheme. Its function is purely to change the meaning of the root word.
