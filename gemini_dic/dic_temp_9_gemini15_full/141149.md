oogonium:/oʊəˈɡoʊniəm/| n. | 卵原细胞；卵巢；卵细胞 | A oogonium is a diploid cell that undergoes meiosis to produce haploid eggs or ova in oogamy.  It's a female gametangium, the structure that produces female gametes (eggs).  | Example: The oogonium undergoes meiosis to produce four haploid cells, but only one survives to become a mature egg. 卵原细胞经过减数分裂产生四个单倍体细胞，但只有一个存活下来成为成熟的卵细胞。|近义词: female gametangium |反义词: antheridium (male gametangium) |名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The oogonium develops within the ovary. = 卵原细胞在卵巢内发育。
This plant's oogonium produces many eggs. = 这种植物的卵原细胞产生许多卵子。

一般过去时:
The scientist observed the oogonium under a microscope. = 科学家在显微镜下观察了卵原细胞。
The oogonium divided to form haploid cells. = 卵原细胞分裂形成单倍体细胞。

现在完成时:
Researchers have studied the development of the oogonium extensively. = 研究人员已经广泛研究了卵原细胞的发育。
The plant has already produced its oogonium. = 植物已经产生了它的卵原细胞。

过去完成时:
The meiosis had already begun in the oogonium before the observation. = 在观察之前，卵原细胞的减数分裂已经开始。
The egg had developed from the oogonium successfully. = 卵子已经成功地从卵原细胞发育而来。

将来时:
The biologist will study the oogonium's genetic material. = 生物学家将研究卵原细胞的遗传物质。
The experiment will show how the oogonium divides. = 实验将显示卵原细胞如何分裂。

虚拟语气:
If the oogonium were damaged, the egg wouldn't develop. = 如果卵原细胞受损，卵子将无法发育。
I wish I had observed the oogonium earlier. = 我希望我早点观察到卵原细胞。

被动语态:
The oogonium was observed by the researchers. = 卵原细胞被研究人员观察到。
The eggs are produced by the oogonium through meiosis. = 卵子通过卵原细胞减数分裂产生。

疑问句:
Where is the oogonium located? = 卵原细胞位于哪里？
How many eggs does the oogonium produce? = 卵原细胞产生多少个卵子？

否定句:
The oogonium did not develop properly. = 卵原细胞发育不良。
The plant did not produce any oogonium this season. = 这种植物本季没有产生任何卵原细胞。
