fahlerz:/ˈfɑːlərts/| n. |贫矿,低品位矿石|Fahlerz is a German term referring to a group of copper-rich sulfide minerals, also known as tetrahedrite or tennantite.  These minerals are complex sulfosalts with variable compositions, often containing significant amounts of copper, iron, antimony, arsenic, and other metals.  They are important ore minerals for copper and other metals, but are often considered "poor ores" (fahlerz) due to the complex processing required to extract the valuable metals. |The fahlerz deposit at the mine yielded a lower-than-expected copper output.  这家矿山的贫矿矿床产出的铜低于预期。|近义词：low-grade ore, poor ore |反义词：high-grade ore, rich ore

例句1: The miners analyzed the fahlerz samples to determine the copper content.  矿工们分析了贫矿样本来确定铜含量。
例句2:  Processing fahlerz requires specialized techniques due to its complex composition.  由于贫矿的成分复杂，其加工需要专门的技术。

PHRASE->
Due to the German origin and specialized usage within geology and mining, there aren't common idiomatic phrases directly involving "fahlerz".  Instead, phrases would be centered around the concept of low-grade ore.

例句1:  The mine focused on extracting high-grade ore, leaving the fahlerz for later. 矿山专注于开采高品位矿石，将贫矿留待以后处理。
例句2:  The economic viability of the project depended on finding richer deposits instead of just fahlerz.  该项目的经济可行性取决于找到更丰富的矿床，而不仅仅是贫矿。
