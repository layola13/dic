词源:
The word "meatball" is a compound word, combining "meat" and "ball".  "Meat" comes from the Old English "mete," meaning food in general, but eventually specializing to refer specifically to animal flesh. "Ball" comes from Old English "balla," meaning a round object.  The combination logically describes the food item.
