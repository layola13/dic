词源:  The name "nickel" comes from the German word "Kupfernickel," which literally translates to "copper devil" or "Old Nick's copper."  This was a term used by miners in the 18th century to describe a mineral that resembled copper but was difficult to process.  It was later discovered to be a nickel ore.  The name eventually evolved into the modern "nickel."
