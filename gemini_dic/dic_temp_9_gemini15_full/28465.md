carburized:/ˈkɑːrbəraɪzd/ | adj. |渗碳的；含碳的 |  Describes a material, usually metal, that has been treated to increase its carbon content, typically to improve its hardness and wear resistance. This is achieved through a process called carburizing, where the material is exposed to a carbon-rich environment at high temperatures. | The carburized steel components showed significantly improved durability.  渗碳钢部件显示出显著提高的耐用性。| hardened, case-hardened |  (No direct antonym, but the opposite process would be decarburization) |形容词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The steel is carburized in a furnace. = 钢材在炉中进行渗碳处理。
Carburized parts are stronger. = 渗碳零件更坚固。


一般过去时:
The engineer carburized the gears. = 工程师对齿轮进行了渗碳处理。
They carburized the steel at high temperature. = 他们在高温下对钢材进行了渗碳处理。


现在完成时:
The company has carburized thousands of parts. = 公司已经对数千个零件进行了渗碳处理。
We have successfully carburized the sample. = 我们已经成功地对样品进行了渗碳处理。


过去完成时:
The parts had been carburized before they were machined. = 零件在加工之前已经进行了渗碳处理。
They had already carburized the components when I arrived. = 我到达时，他们已经对部件进行了渗碳处理。


将来时:
We will carburize the components tomorrow. = 我们明天将对部件进行渗碳处理。
The factory will carburize the steel using a new method. = 工厂将采用一种新方法对钢材进行渗碳处理。


虚拟语气:
If we carburized the steel longer, it would be harder. = 如果我们对钢材进行更长时间的渗碳处理，它会更硬。
I wish we had carburized the parts more deeply. = 我希望我们对零件进行更深的渗碳处理。


被动语态:
The steel was carburized in a controlled atmosphere. = 钢材在受控气氛下进行渗碳处理。
The components are being carburized right now. = 零件正在进行渗碳处理。


疑问句:
Has the material been carburized yet? = 材料已经渗碳了吗？
Was the steel properly carburized? = 钢材渗碳处理是否正确？


否定句:
The parts were not carburized correctly. = 零件的渗碳处理不正确。
We did not carburize the steel before quenching. = 我们在淬火前没有对钢材进行渗碳处理。
