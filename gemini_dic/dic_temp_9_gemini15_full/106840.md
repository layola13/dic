laboris: /ˈleɪbəriːs/ | n. | 劳力；劳动；工作 |  The word "laboris" is the genitive singular form of the Latin word "labor," meaning "labor," "work," or "toil."  It is not a word commonly used in modern English;  it's more likely encountered in academic contexts dealing with Latin or its derivatives. Its meaning is entirely derived from the Latin root. | Example: The fruits of their laboris were evident in the bountiful harvest. (他们劳动的成果在丰收中显而易见。) | 近义词: toil, exertion, effort | 反义词: leisure, idleness | 名词


USAGE->
This word, being a Latin genitive, doesn't have typical English verb conjugations.  Its usage is limited to expressing possession or relationship, similarly to how "the king's crown" uses the possessive form of "king."

PHRASE->
Because "laboris" is a singular genitive form, phrase usage requires context with other words in a sentence.  It's not used in common English phrases.  Example phrases would involve its use in a sentence, such as: "The reward for laboris,"  "The hardship of laboris," etc.
