pandowdy:/pænˈdaʊdi/| n. |苹果甜馅饼|A pandowdy is a baked dessert, typically made with apples, that is similar to a crumble or cobbler.  It features a thick, buttery crust or topping that is often partially or fully submerged in the fruit filling during baking.  The name's origin is uncertain, but it's likely derived from the Dutch word  "pompoen" (pumpkin) and possibly related to "dowdy," meaning "shabby" or "unfashionable." This suggests that the early versions of the dish might have been a simple, rustic dessert.| Example:  My grandmother's apple pandowdy was always a highlight of our family gatherings.  我的祖母的苹果甜馅饼总是我们家庭聚会的亮点。  The restaurant's seasonal pumpkin pandowdy is highly recommended. 这家餐厅的季节性南瓜甜馅饼强烈推荐。|近义词：cobbler, crumble, crisp|反义词：无|名词
