词源:
ransom (n.)  Old French rançon "ransom, redemption price," from Frankish *ran- "counsel, advice," + *kaun- "brave," "strong,"  (influenced by Old English *ge-ræden "counsel, advice").  The sense evolution is from "counsel" to "price paid for counsel or release" to "ransom." The verb is a later development from the noun.
