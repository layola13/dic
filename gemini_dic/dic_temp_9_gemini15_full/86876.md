hemipeptone:/ˈhɛmiˌpɛptoʊn/| n. |半胨|A hemipeptone is a partially digested protein, a product of incomplete proteolysis.  It is a mixture of peptides of varying lengths, smaller than proteoses but larger than peptones.  Hemipeptones are used in microbiology and other biological applications as a nutrient source in culture media. |Example: The growth medium contained hemipeptone, providing essential amino acids for bacterial cultivation. 半胨培养基为细菌培养提供了必需氨基酸。|近义词:partially digested protein, peptide mixture|反义词:intact protein, complete protein|名词
