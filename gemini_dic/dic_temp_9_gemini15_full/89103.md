词源:

The word "homageable" is derived from "homage" + "-able".  "Homage" comes from Old French "homaige," ultimately from the Germanic *hōm- "home, dwelling, household" + *-age "state or condition".  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or suitability.  Therefore, "homageable" signifies worthy of the act of homage or respect.
