词源:  From Middle English *cognisaunce, from Anglo-Norman French *connaissance, from Old French conissance, from Vulgar Latin *cognoscentiam, accusative of *cognoscens, present participle of Latin cognoscere "to know, learn, understand," from com- "together" + gnoscere "to know" (related to Greek gignōskein "to know").  The shift in meaning to include "emblem" or "badge" is a later development, related to the idea of recognizing or identifying something through a symbol.
