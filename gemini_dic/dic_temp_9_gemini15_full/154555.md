词源:  The word is a relatively rare and modern coinage, likely formed from "per-" (thoroughly) and a root related to "potation" (drinking), suggesting an image of excessive and rambling talk, like excessive drinking.  However, a definitive etymological source is difficult to pinpoint.  It's likely a blend of existing words to create a new, descriptive term.
