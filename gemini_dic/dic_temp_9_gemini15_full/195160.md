semidefiniteness:/ˌsɛmiˈdɛfɪnɪtnəs/| n. |半正定性|The property of a matrix (or operator) being positive semidefinite;  meaning that all its eigenvalues are non-negative.  It signifies a condition where a quadratic form associated with the matrix is always non-negative. In simpler terms, it describes a situation where a certain mathematical object (often a matrix) is "at least" positive, allowing for the possibility of zero values but excluding negative values.|The semidefiniteness of the covariance matrix is crucial in many statistical applications.|近义词:positive semidefiniteness|反义词:negative definiteness, indefiniteness|名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in mathematical contexts, particularly in linear algebra and optimization. There is no typical grammatical usage in the same way as a common word like "what."  Its usage revolves around describing mathematical properties.  The following examples show how it might appear in sentences:

Example 1 (Statement):
The semidefiniteness of the kernel guarantees the convergence of the algorithm. = 核的半正定性保证了算法的收敛性。


Example 2 (Question):
Is the matrix's semidefiniteness a necessary condition for this theorem? = 矩阵的半正定性是这个定理的必要条件吗？


Example 3 (Explanation):
We prove the semidefiniteness by showing that all eigenvalues are non-negative. = 我们通过证明所有特征值都是非负的来证明半正定性。


Example 4 (Contrast):
Unlike indefinite matrices, semidefinite matrices have a simpler structure. = 与不定矩阵不同，半定矩阵具有更简单的结构。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "semidefiniteness." Its usage is highly technical and within the specific vocabulary of mathematics and related fields.  Phrases would typically involve mathematical terms and symbols rather than common English words. For example:

* positive semidefinite matrix
* semidefinite programming
* properties of semidefiniteness
* conditions for semidefiniteness
* application of semidefiniteness
