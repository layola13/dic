词源:
The word "coziness" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "cosy," which in turn is believed to be connected to the Old Norse word "koss" meaning "kiss" or "caress."  The implication is that something cozy is pleasant and comforting, like a loving caress.  The modern spelling "cozy" emerged later, and "coziness" followed as a natural extension to describe the state of being cozy.
