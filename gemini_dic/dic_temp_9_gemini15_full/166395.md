/ˌpriːrɪˈzɛmbəld/ | v. | 预先相似；预先类似 |  The word "preresembled" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, meaning a newly coined word or expression.  It appears to be a combination of "pre-" (meaning before) and "resembled" (past tense of resemble, meaning to be similar to).  Therefore, it likely means "resembled beforehand" or "was similar to something previously".  However, because it's not a standard word, its usage is limited and should be avoided in formal writing. Instead, use more standard phrasing to convey the intended meaning.  For example, one could say "it was similar to its predecessor" or "it bore a resemblance to earlier versions." |  The new design preresembled the old one in many ways. = 新的设计在许多方面都与旧的设计相似。   The painting preresembled a style popular in the 18th century. = 这幅画预先类似于18世纪流行的一种风格。 |  similar to, like, analogous to | dissimilar to, unlike, different from | 动词
