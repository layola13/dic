词源:

The word "received" comes from the Old French word "receivre," which in turn comes from the Latin word "recipere," meaning "to take back," "to take again," or "to recover."  The prefix "re-" indicates repetition or return, and "capere" means "to take" or "to seize."  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the act of getting or being given something.
