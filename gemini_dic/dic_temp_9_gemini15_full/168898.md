词源:

The word "professionalised" is derived from the noun "profession" and the suffix "-alised" (or "-ized" in American English).  "Profession" ultimately comes from the Middle English word "professioun," derived from the Old French "profession" and ultimately from the Latin "professio," meaning "declaration," "avowal," or "public affirmation."  The suffix "-alised" is a suffix of action or process, indicating that something is being made or becoming something.  Therefore, "professionalised" describes the process of making something or someone conform to the standards of a profession.
