词源:
The word "sewer" comes from the Old French word "seoir," meaning "to sit."  This is because early sewers were often constructed in low-lying areas.  The meaning evolved to refer to the channel itself.  The sense of "one who sews" is an older, now less common meaning deriving from the same Old French root.
