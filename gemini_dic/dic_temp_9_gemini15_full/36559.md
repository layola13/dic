collapsars:/kəˈlæpsɑːrz/| n.|坍缩星|A collapsar is a type of supernova resulting from the collapse of a very massive star.  The core collapses into a black hole, and powerful jets are launched, emitting intense radiation. This process is thought to be responsible for some long-duration gamma-ray bursts.|Example: The intense energy released by a collapsar can be detected across vast cosmic distances.|近义词：hypernova, supernova (in a specific context)|反义词：N/A
