词源:
The word "gall" ultimately derives from the Proto-Germanic *galō, meaning "bile" or "gall." This root also gave rise to related words in other Germanic languages, such as Old English *gealla.  The meaning extended to include bitterness, anger, and impudence due to the bitter taste of bile and the association of bitterness with strong negative emotions.
