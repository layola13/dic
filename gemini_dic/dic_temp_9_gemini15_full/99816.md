词源:

* **inter-**:  prefix meaning "between," "among," or "mutually."
* **min-**:  from Latin *minutus*, meaning "small,"  but in this context implying "to lessen" or "to reduce" (as in "diminish").  The sense is negated by the prefix.
* **-able**: suffix meaning "capable of," "worthy of," or forming adjectives.
* **-ness**: suffix forming nouns of state or condition.
* **-es**: plural suffix for nouns.

Therefore, "interminablenesses" literally means "the states of being incapable of being lessened or diminished," referring to something without end.  The double suffix "-ness-es" creates a highly unusual and rarely used plural form.
