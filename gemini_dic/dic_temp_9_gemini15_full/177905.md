词源:
The word "recharger" is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") and the word "charger," which originally meant "someone or something that loads or fills something."  "Charger" itself ultimately comes from the Old French word "charger," meaning "to load," which in turn comes from the Latin word "carricare" meaning "to load a wagon".  Therefore, "recharger" literally means "to load again" or "to refill."
