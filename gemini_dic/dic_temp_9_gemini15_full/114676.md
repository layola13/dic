词源:
The word "malignancy" comes from the Middle English word "malignaunce," which itself derives from the Old French "malignaunce," meaning "malice, wickedness."  The prefix "mal-" means "bad" or "evil," and the root "-ign-" relates to "doing" or "acting."  The suffix "-ancy" indicates a state or quality.  Therefore, the word's etymology points to a state of being evil or harmful.
