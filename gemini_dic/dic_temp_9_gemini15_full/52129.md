The word "dians" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a proper noun:**  Is it a name, place, or abbreviation specific to a certain field?  If so, please provide more context.
* **It's a word from another language:**  If it's from another language, please specify the language so I can try to provide a translation and explanation.
* **It's a newly coined word or slang:**  If it's very recent slang, it may not yet be in dictionaries.

Please provide more information so I can assist you accurately.
