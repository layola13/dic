词源:
From scandal (n.) + -ousness (suffix forming nouns of quality or state).  The word "scandal" itself originates from the Greek word "skandalon," meaning "trap," "snare," or "stumbling block."  Over time, its meaning evolved to refer to something that causes offense or disgrace.  The suffix "-ousness" adds the quality or state of being scandalous.
