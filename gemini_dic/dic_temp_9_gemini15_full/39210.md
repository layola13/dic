conglaciation: /ˌkɒŋɡlæsiˈeɪʃən/ | n. |冰川作用再发生；再冰川化 | The process by which a region undergoes a renewed period of glaciation after a period of deglaciation.  It refers to a subsequent period of ice advance after an earlier glacial period, often resulting in the deposition of new glacial sediments over older ones. | Example:  The evidence suggests a period of conglaciation following the last glacial maximum.  证据表明，在末次盛冰期之后有一段冰川作用再发生时期。 | 近义词: re-glaciation, renewed glaciation | 反义词: deglaciation
