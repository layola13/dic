词源:  The word "haltings" is the plural form of the noun "halting," which derives from the verb "halt," meaning "to stop."  The "-ing" suffix transforms the verb into a noun describing the act or state of halting.  The ultimate origin traces back to Old English "haltan," meaning "to limp" or "to hop."  This connection highlights the image of interrupted or unsteady movement.
