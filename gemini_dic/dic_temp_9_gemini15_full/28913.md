词源:  The word is a compound of "carriage" and "way." "Carriage" here refers to the act of carrying or being carried, specifically referring to vehicles.  "Way" signifies a path or road.  Therefore, the word literally means "the way for carriages."  Its origin traces back to the time when horse-drawn carriages were the primary mode of transportation.
