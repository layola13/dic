词源:
The word "flameproofed" is a combination of "flame" (referring to fire) and "proofed" (meaning protected or made resistant).  "Proofed" comes from the Old French word "pruver" meaning "to prove" or "to test."  The suffix "-ed" indicates the past participle, showing that something has been treated or made flame-resistant.
