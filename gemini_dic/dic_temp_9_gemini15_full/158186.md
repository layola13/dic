词源:

The word "platonically" derives from the name Plato (Πλάτων), a classical Greek philosopher.  His philosophical writings explored the nature of love, including a concept of a non-sexual, purely intellectual or spiritual bond between individuals, which became known as "platonic love."  The adverb "platonically" reflects this origin, describing relationships characterized by this type of idealized friendship.
