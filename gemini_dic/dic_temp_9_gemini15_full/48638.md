词源:
The word "defender" comes from the Old French word "defendeor," which itself derives from the verb "defendre," meaning "to defend."  This ultimately traces back to the Latin word "defendere," composed of "de-" (away, off) and "fendere" (to strike, cleave).  Thus, the original sense involved warding off a strike or attack.
