词源:
The term "credit rating" is a compound word. "Credit" derives from the Old French word "crede," meaning "belief" or "trust," ultimately from the Latin word "credere," meaning "to believe."  "Rating" comes from the word "rate," meaning to assess or evaluate, which has roots in the Old French "rater," meaning "to miss" or "to fail," but evolved to mean to estimate or value something.  Therefore, "credit rating" literally means an assessment of the trustworthiness or believability of a borrower's ability to repay debt.
