* **Justifiable:**  This adjective comes from the verb "justify," meaning "to show something to be right or reasonable."
* **-ness:** This suffix is added to adjectives to form nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.  Therefore, "-ness" transforms "justifiable" into "justifiableness," signifying the state or quality of being justifiable.
