用法说明：

“Non-definitive” is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that is not conclusive or final. It emphasizes the temporary or uncertain nature of a result, diagnosis, decision, or statement.  It suggests that more information or evidence is needed before a firm conclusion can be reached.  The word carries a sense of incompleteness or provisionality.  It is often used in contexts where certainty is lacking, such as medical diagnoses, scientific research, or legal proceedings.
