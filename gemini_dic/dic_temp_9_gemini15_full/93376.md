词源：

The word "illeviable" is derived from the prefix "il-" (meaning "not") and the verb "levy," which originates from Old French *lever ("to raise, lift").  "Levy" in this context refers to the act of imposing or collecting a tax, fine, or other payment.  Therefore, "illeviable" literally means "not able to be levied" or collected.
