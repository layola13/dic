monotonicity: /ˌmɒnəˈtɒnɪsəti/ /ˌmɑːnəˈtɑːnɪsəti/ | n. | 单调性，无变化性 | The quality or state of being monotonous; lack of variation.  Monotonicity refers to the property of a function where it consistently increases or decreases (or remains constant) over its entire domain. In mathematics, it's a crucial concept in optimization and analysis. | Example: The monotonicity of the data made it difficult to identify any significant trends.  单调的数据使得难以识别任何显著的趋势。 The monotonicity of the production line was causing worker fatigue. 生产线的单调性导致工人疲劳。|近义词：uniformity, sameness, regularity |反义词：variability, diversity, fluctuation |名词
