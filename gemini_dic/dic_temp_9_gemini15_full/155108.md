petrologically:/ˌpɛtroʊˈlɑːdʒɪkli/| adv.| 岩石学上地，从岩石学的角度 |Adverb describing something done or considered from the perspective of petrology, the branch of geology that studies rocks and their origin, composition, structure, and history.  |The rock samples were analyzed petrologically to determine their age and origin.  岩石样本经过岩石学分析以确定其年代和起源。|geologically, mineralogically|  (反义词较难直接给出，因为是描述角度，而非性质)
