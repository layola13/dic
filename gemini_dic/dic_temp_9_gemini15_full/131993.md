词源:
The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "conviviality".  "Conviviality" comes from the Late Latin word "convivialitas,"  itself derived from the Latin "convivialis" (festive, sociable).  "Convivialis" is built from "con-" (together) and "vivere" (to live).  Therefore, "nonconviviality" literally means "not living together in a festive or sociable way."
