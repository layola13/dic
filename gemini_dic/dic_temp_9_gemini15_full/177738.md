recarburization:/ˌriːkɑːrbəraɪˈzeɪʃən/| n. |再渗碳；再碳化|The process of adding carbon back into steel or iron to restore its hardness and other properties after it has been subjected to a process that removed some of its carbon, such as annealing or normalizing.  This is often done to improve the wear resistance and strength of the material.|例句：The carburization process was followed by a decarburization step, and then the final product needed recarburization to achieve the desired hardness. 再渗碳工艺是在脱碳步骤之后进行的，然后最终产品需要再渗碳以达到所需的硬度。


The recarburization of the steel components is crucial for maintaining their structural integrity under high-stress conditions. 钢铁部件的再渗碳对于保持其在高应力条件下的结构完整性至关重要。|近义词：recarbonization |反义词：decarburization
