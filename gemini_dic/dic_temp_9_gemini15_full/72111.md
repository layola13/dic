The word "flockmel" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and usage description cannot be provided.  It is likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure lexicon.  To provide an analysis, I would need more context on where you encountered this word.
