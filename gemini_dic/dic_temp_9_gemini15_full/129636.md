Etymology:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "controversial."  "Controversial" originates from the Latin word "controversia," meaning "dispute" or "debate," which itself is derived from "controvertere," meaning "to turn against" or "to dispute."  Therefore, "non-controversial" literally means "not causing dispute or debate."
