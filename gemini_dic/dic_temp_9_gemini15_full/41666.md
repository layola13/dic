The word "correlativenesses" is the plural form of "correlativeness," which itself is a noun derived from the adjective "correlative."  Let's break down its etymology and usage:

* **Etymology:**

    * **correlate (v.):**  Comes from the Latin "cor-," meaning "together," and "relatus," the past participle of "referre," meaning "to refer" or "to bring back."  Thus, "correlate" originally meant "to bring together in relation."

    * **correlative (adj.):**  Derived from "correlate," adding the suffix "-ive," which forms adjectives meaning "having the nature of" or "tending to."

    * **correlativeness (n.):** Formed from "correlative" by adding the suffix "-ness," which creates nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.

    * **correlativenesses (n.):** The plural form of "correlativeness," indicating multiple instances of correlation or relatedness.


* **Usage:**

"Correlativenesses" refers to multiple instances or aspects of correlation or interconnectedness. It is less frequently used than "correlations" but is grammatically correct.  It's often used in academic or technical writing where a nuanced emphasis on the multiple facets of the relationship is desired.

* **Example Sentences:**

    The researchers examined the various correlativenesses between climate change and agricultural yields.  研究人员检查了气候变化与农业产量之间的各种相关性。

    The report highlighted the complex correlativenesses among factors contributing to the economic crisis.  该报告强调了导致经济危机的各种因素之间的复杂相关性。


There are no specific grammatical tenses associated with the noun "correlativenesses" as nouns do not conjugate in the same way verbs do.  The word's use within a sentence will determine the tense of the overall sentence.

* **Phrases (using "correlation" rather than the less common "correlativenesses"):**

    * high correlation 高相关性
    * strong correlation 强相关性
    * weak correlation 弱相关性
    * negative correlation 负相关性
    * positive correlation 正相关性


The word "correlativenesses" is a relatively uncommon word.  In most cases, "correlations" would be a more suitable and readily understood alternative.
