词源：
The word "disembodiment" comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "removal of" or "opposite of") and the noun "embodiment" (meaning "a tangible form of something abstract").  "Embodiment" itself derives from the Old French "enbodiment," ultimately from the Latin "in" (in) + "corpus" (body).  Therefore, disembodiment literally means the removal or absence of a body or physical form.
