lossy:/ˈlɔːsi/| adj.|有损的，失真的|In data compression, lossy means that some data is lost during the compression process, resulting in a smaller file size but also some loss of quality.  This is in contrast to lossless compression, where no data is lost.  Common examples include JPEG image compression and MP3 audio compression. |例句：JPEG is a lossy compression algorithm, meaning some image data is discarded to reduce file size.  JPEG是一种有损压缩算法，这意味着一些图像数据被丢弃以减小文件大小。|近义词：compressed, imperfect, degraded|反义词：lossless


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The audio file is lossy. = 音频文件是有损的。
This compression method is lossy. = 这种压缩方法是有损的。

一般过去时:
The image was lossy after compression. = 图片压缩后是有损的。
We used a lossy codec for the video. = 我们为视频使用了有损编解码器。

现在完成时:
They have used lossy compression for years. = 他们多年来一直使用有损压缩。
We have noticed the lossy quality of the recording. = 我们已经注意到录音的失真质量。

过去完成时:
The data had already been lossily compressed. = 数据已经被有损压缩了。
I had realized that the algorithm was lossy. = 我已经意识到该算法是有损的。

将来时:
We will use a lossy codec for the streaming video. = 我们将对流媒体视频使用有损编解码器。
This will likely result in a lossy file. = 这可能会导致一个有损文件。

虚拟语气:
If it were lossless, the file would be much larger. = 如果它是无损的，文件就会大得多。
I wish the compression were lossless. = 我希望压缩是无损的。

被动语态:
The audio is often lossily compressed for online streaming. = 音频通常会被有损压缩以用于在线流媒体播放。
The image quality was degraded by the lossy compression. = 图像质量因有损压缩而下降。

疑问句:
Is the video file lossy or lossless? = 视频文件是有损的还是无损的？
Are we using a lossy compression technique? = 我们使用的是有损压缩技术吗？

否定句:
The data is not lossy; it's lossless. = 数据不是有损的；它是无损的。
This algorithm is not lossy; it preserves all data. = 此算法不是有损的；它保留所有数据。


PHRASE->
lossy compression = 有损压缩
lossy audio = 有损音频
lossy image = 有损图像
lossy video = 有损视频
lossy data = 有损数据
