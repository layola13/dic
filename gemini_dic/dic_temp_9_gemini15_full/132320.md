词源:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of."
* **definite**:  From Latin "definītus," past participle of "definīre" (to define, limit, determine).  This ultimately relates to "fīnīre" (to end, bound).
* **-ness**: A suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.
* **-es**: A plural suffix for nouns ending in -s, -sh, -ch, -x, or -z.

Therefore, "nondefinitenesses" literally means "the states or qualities of not being definite."


用法说明:

This word is relatively uncommon in everyday conversation. It is primarily used in specialized fields like linguistics, logic, and computer science where the precise definition and reference of things are crucial.  The plural form emphasizes the existence of multiple instances of ambiguity or vagueness.  It's important to note that while "nondefiniteness" is a more commonly used singular form, the plural "nondefinitenesses" is grammatically correct and sometimes necessary when discussing multiple instances of uncertainty or lack of definition.
