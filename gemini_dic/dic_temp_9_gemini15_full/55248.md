词源:
The word "dissimulated" comes from the Latin word "dissimulare," which means "to disguise" or "to conceal."  The prefix "dis-" means "apart" or "away," and "simulare" means "to imitate" or "to pretend."  Therefore, dissimulated literally means "to put apart" or "to separate" from the true nature.
