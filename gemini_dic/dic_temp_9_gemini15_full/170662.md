词源:Pseudo- comes from the Greek word ψευδής (pseudēs), meaning "false" or "lying." Problem comes from the Old French word probleme, ultimately from the Greek word πρόβλημα (próblēma), meaning "something thrown forward" or "a question proposed for solution."  Therefore, pseudo-problem literally means a "false problem."
