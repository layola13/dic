词源:
The word "defilement" comes from the Old French word "defoulement," meaning "to make foul" or "to pollute". It is related to the verb "defile," which ultimately derives from the Latin "defilare," meaning "to make foul" or "to spoil."  The Latin root suggests a connection to the idea of making something less pure or clean, either physically or morally.
