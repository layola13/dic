词源:

The word "remunerable" derives from the Latin word "remunerare," which means "to reward" or "to compensate."  The prefix "re-" indicates "again" or "back," and "munus" means "gift" or "duty."  Therefore, the root meaning implies a return gift or compensation for a service rendered or a duty performed.  The suffix "-able" makes it an adjective, meaning capable of being remunerated.
