词源:

The term derives from "nabob," a word that originated in the Urdu word "nawab" (نواب), meaning "deputy," "viceroy," or "governor."  In the 18th and 19th centuries, British officials in India, particularly those who amassed great fortunes, were often referred to as "nabobs."  Thus, "nabobisms" came to denote the opulent lifestyle and showy displays of wealth associated with these individuals.  The word's evolution reflects the historical context of British colonialism in India and the cultural clash between Eastern and Western lifestyles.
