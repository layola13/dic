The word "moky" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a slang term, a proper noun, or a word from a specific dialect or language.  To provide the analysis you requested, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (book, conversation, website, etc.)
* **What was the surrounding text or conversation?** This will help determine the intended meaning.

Once you provide this additional information, I can attempt to provide a more accurate analysis.
