词源:

The word "kiteflying" is a compound word, combining "kite" and "flying."  "Kite" originates from Old English "cyta," likely from a Germanic root, referring to a bird of prey. Its evolution into the modern sense of a toy kite is believed to be influenced by its resemblance to a bird in flight. "Flying" comes from Old English "fleogan," meaning "to fly."  Therefore, "kiteflying" literally describes the act of making a kite fly.
