用法说明：

`multi-articular` primarily functions as an adjective, describing movements or exercises that involve the coordinated action of multiple joints.  It's frequently used in fields like:

* **Anatomy:** To describe muscles that cross and act upon more than one joint.

* **Kinesiology:** To categorize exercises and movements based on their joint involvement.
