non-regression:/ˌnɒn rɪˈɡreʃən/| adj. |非回归；不倒退|  Describes a situation or process where something does not revert to a previous state or condition, typically a less desirable one.  It often refers to ensuring that new changes or updates to a system do not introduce errors or break previously working functionalities. | Example: The new software update ensured non-regression of existing features.  新的软件更新确保了现有功能不会倒退。| 近义词: maintenance, preservation, stability | 反义词: regression, deterioration, decline |


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The new code ensures non-regression testing. = 新代码确保了非回归测试。
Non-regression testing is crucial for software development. = 非回归测试对软件开发至关重要。


一般过去时:
The previous update caused regression; this one ensured non-regression. = 上一个更新导致了回归；这次更新确保了不倒退。
They implemented rigorous testing to guarantee non-regression. = 他们实施了严格的测试以保证不倒退。


现在完成时:
We have achieved non-regression in all key features. = 我们已经实现了所有关键功能的不倒退。
The developers have ensured non-regression through thorough testing. = 开发人员通过彻底的测试确保了不倒退。


过去完成时:
Before the patch, the system had experienced regression; afterward, non-regression was confirmed. = 在补丁之前，系统经历了倒退；之后，确认了不倒退。
They had anticipated potential regressions, so they prioritized non-regression testing. = 他们预料到潜在的倒退，因此他们优先进行了非回归测试。


将来时:
The next release will guarantee non-regression of core functionalities. = 下一个版本将保证核心功能不倒退。
We will implement additional tests to prevent regression and ensure non-regression. = 我们将实施额外的测试以防止倒退并确保不倒退。


虚拟语气:
If we had performed more thorough testing, we would have avoided regression and ensured non-regression. = 如果我们进行了更彻底的测试，我们将避免倒退并确保不倒退。
It is vital that the update maintains non-regression of critical systems. = 更新必须保持关键系统的稳定，不发生倒退，这一点至关重要。


被动语态:
Non-regression testing is often conducted by dedicated teams. = 非回归测试通常由专门的团队进行。
The stability of the system is maintained through rigorous non-regression checks. = 系统的稳定性通过严格的非回归检查来维持。


疑问句:
Does the new build guarantee non-regression? = 新版本是否保证不倒退？
Have we implemented sufficient measures to ensure non-regression? = 我们是否实施了足够的措施来确保不倒退？


否定句:
The update did not achieve full non-regression. = 更新并没有完全实现不倒退。
The system showed signs of regression; non-regression was not entirely successful. = 系统显示出倒退的迹象；不倒退并没有完全成功。


PHRASE->
non-regression testing = 非回归测试
non-regression bugs = 非回归错误
ensure non-regression = 确保不倒退
guarantee non-regression = 保证不倒退
achieve non-regression = 实现不倒退

词源:
The word "non-regression" is a compound word. "Non" is a prefix meaning "not," and "regression" refers to a return to a previous or less desirable state.  The term originates from software engineering and testing, where it describes the goal of preventing newly introduced code from breaking existing functionality.
