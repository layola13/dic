词源:

The word "readership" is derived from the verb "to read" and the suffix "-ship," which denotes a state, condition, or quality, or a group of people sharing a common characteristic.  The suffix "-ship" is found in many words denoting status, skill, or collective association, like "friendship," "membership," and "scholarship".  Therefore, "readership" literally means the "state or quality of being read" or, more commonly understood, the group of people who read something.
