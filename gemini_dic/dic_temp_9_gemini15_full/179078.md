redeposition:/ˌriːˌdɛpəˈzɪʃən/| n. |再沉积；再淀积|The process by which sediment, soil, or rocks are transported and deposited in a new location.  This can be caused by various factors, including water, wind, ice, or gravity.  The redeposited material may be different in composition or structure from the original deposit.|Example: The river's flood caused significant redeposition of sediment along its banks.  这条河的洪水导致其河岸沿线发生了大量的泥沙再沉积。  The redeposition of eroded soil led to the formation of a new alluvial fan.  侵蚀土壤的再沉积导致新的冲积扇的形成。|近义词：re-sedimentation, deposition (in a new location)|反义词：erosion, removal

否定句:
No significant redeposition occurred in this area. = 这个区域没有发生明显的再沉积。
The study showed that little redeposition had taken place. = 研究表明几乎没有发生再沉积。
