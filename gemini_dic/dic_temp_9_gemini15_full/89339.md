homoioptoton: /ˌhoʊmiˈɒptətɒn/ | n. | 同音词复沓 |  The stylistic device of using words or phrases of similar sound, especially in successive clauses or sentences.  It is a type of paronomasia (pun) where the similarity is in sound rather than meaning.  | Example:  "The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain." (The repetition of the similar sounds "ain" creates a homoioptoton). | 近义词:  assonance, paronomasia, polyptoton | 反义词:  N/A


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in discussions of rhetoric and literary analysis, not in everyday conversation.  There aren't typical tenses or grammatical structures associated with its usage.  Instead, examples illustrate its application within a sentence or phrase.


Example 1:
"The splendor of the day, the tender grace of the way." (Repetition of "day" and "way" sounds, creating a homoioptoton) = “白天的辉煌，道路的温柔优雅。”（“day”和“way”的声音重复，形成了一个homoioptoton）

Example 2:
"Hear the mellow wedding bells." (Repetition of the "ell" sound creates a homoioptoton) = “听那柔和的婚礼钟声。”（“ell”声音的重复创造了一个homoioptoton）


PHRASE->
Homoioptoton is not typically used in phrases in the same way as common words. Its use is contextual and within sentence structure to describe a stylistic choice.  Therefore, standard phrase examples are not applicable.
