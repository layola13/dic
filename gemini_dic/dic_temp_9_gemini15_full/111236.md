lithotype:/ˈlɪθəʊtaɪp/ | n. | 岩石类型；岩相 | A lithotype is a descriptive term for a specific type of rock, based on its visible characteristics such as color, texture, and composition.  It's a more general term than a formal rock classification.  Lithotypes are often used in geological mapping and field descriptions. | Example: The geologist identified several lithotypes in the outcrop, including sandstone, shale, and conglomerate.  地质学家在露头上识别出几种岩石类型，包括砂岩、页岩和砾岩。|近义词：rock type, rock facies |反义词：N/A
