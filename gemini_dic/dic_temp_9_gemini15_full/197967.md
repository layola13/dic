词源:
Shiveringly is derived from the verb "shiver,"  meaning to tremble from cold or fear. The suffix "-ingly" transforms the verb into an adverb, indicating the manner in which an action is performed.  The word's origins trace back to Old English "scīverian," related to the concept of shaking or trembling.
