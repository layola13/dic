词源:

From Old English *hlāford (lord) + -ship (suffix denoting state, condition, etc.).  The word "lord" itself has roots in Old English "hlāford," meaning "loaf-ward,"  referring to the person who guarded or distributed the loaf of bread.  The suffix "-ship" indicates possession or condition, thus "lordship" signifies the state of being a lord, the authority of a lord, or a respectful address to one.
