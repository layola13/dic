generalisation:/ˌdʒenərəlaɪˈzeɪʃən/| n. |概括；普遍化；推广|The act of making a general statement or concept from specific examples;  a general statement, law, or principle. It involves identifying common features or patterns among diverse instances and formulating a broader conclusion. This process can be inductive (from specific to general) or deductive (from general to specific). Generalisations can be helpful for simplifying complex information and making predictions, but they can also be oversimplifications or stereotypes if not carefully considered. |例句：His theory is a generalisation based on limited evidence. 他的理论是基于有限证据的概括。

His generalisation about women drivers is offensive. 他关于女司机的概括很冒犯人。|近义词：summary, generalization, abstraction, synopsis|反义词：specificity, detail, particularity
