The word "niser" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, jargon specific to a certain field, or slang used within a particular community.  If this is the case, please provide more context about where you encountered this word.
* **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or place name. Again, context is needed.
