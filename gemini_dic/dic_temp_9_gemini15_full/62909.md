WORD ORIGIN->
The word "enlistment" comes from the verb "enlist," which itself originates from the Old French word "enlister," meaning "to enroll" or "to register."  The prefix "en-" means "in" or "into," and the root "-list" relates to a list or register.  Therefore, "enlistment" literally refers to the act of being added to a list, particularly a military register.
