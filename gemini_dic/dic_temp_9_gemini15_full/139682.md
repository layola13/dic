The word "occursion" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a very rarely used neologism.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, I need a correct word.  Did you perhaps mean "occasion," "occurrence," or another similar word?
