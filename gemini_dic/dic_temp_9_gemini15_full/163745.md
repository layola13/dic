词源:
The word "predefrayed" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the verb "defray," which originally meant "to pay the cost of," but in this context refers to the wearing away or damaging of fabric.  The modern usage has evolved to describe intentionally worn fabrics.  While not a common word, its meaning is easily understood through its component parts.
