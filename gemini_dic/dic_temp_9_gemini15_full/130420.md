/ˌnɒnəˈbændənments/ | n. | 未放弃；不放弃；继续；坚持 | The word "nonabandonments" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, meaning a newly coined word or expression.  It's formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the noun "abandonments."  Therefore, it implies the opposite of abandonment;  a state or instance of not abandoning something or someone.  It could refer to continued support, persistent commitment, or a refusal to give up. However, due to its unusual nature, it lacks established usage and clear contextual meaning.  A more common and clearer way to express the idea would be to use phrases like "continued support," "persistent commitment," "refusal to abandon," or "continued engagement." | Example: (This example uses the concept, not the word itself, as the word is not in common use)  The company's nonabandonment of its research project, despite initial setbacks, ultimately led to a breakthrough.  公司的研发项目在最初遭遇挫折后并未放弃，最终取得了突破。 | 近义词: continued support, persistent commitment, unwavering dedication, steadfastness | 反义词: abandonment, desertion, relinquishment |  名词
