词源:  The word "butterflying" is a relatively recent and informal usage.  It's a combination of "butterfly" and "-ing," using the "-ing" form to create a noun describing the action or state of butterflies flying, or metaphorically, the state of nervousness.  The metaphorical use likely arose from the fluttering of a butterfly's wings being visually similar to the feeling of a nervous stomach.
