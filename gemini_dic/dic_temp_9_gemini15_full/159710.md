polycation:/ˌpɒliˈkeɪʃən/ /ˌpɑːliˈkeɪʃən/| n. |聚阳离子|A polycation is a polymer or molecule carrying multiple positive charges.  These positive charges arise from the presence of multiple cationic functional groups within its structure. Polycations are often used in various applications due to their ability to interact strongly with negatively charged molecules or surfaces. |Example:  Polycations are used in gene therapy to condense DNA for efficient delivery into cells.  聚阳离子用于基因治疗，以浓缩DNA，从而有效地将其递送至细胞。|近义词：cationic polymer, polyelectrolyte (if also containing anionic groups)|反义词：polyanion|名词
