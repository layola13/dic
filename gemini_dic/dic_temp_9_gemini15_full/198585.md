词源:
The word "shucker" derives from the verb "shuck," meaning to remove the husk or shell from something, especially corn or oysters.  The verb "shuck" itself has origins in Middle English and ultimately relates to Old English words connected to pushing or thrusting.  Therefore, "shuckers" is a relatively straightforward occupational term formed by adding the agentive suffix "-er" to the verb "shuck."
