词源:
The word "sass" likely originated as a shortened form of "saucy," meaning impertinent or impudent.  "Saucy" itself comes from the Old French word "sals," meaning "salty," which evolved to describe someone with a sharp, pungent, or impertinent manner.  The transition from "salty" to "impudent" is likely due to the association of saltiness with sharpness and boldness of character.
