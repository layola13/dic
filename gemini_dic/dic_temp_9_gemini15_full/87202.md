hereditability:/ˌhɛrɪtəˈbɪləti/ | n. |遗传性，遗传力 | The degree to which genetic differences among individuals contribute to individual differences in a particular trait.  It's a measure of how much variation in a trait is due to genes, as opposed to environmental factors.  A heritability of 0 means no genetic influence, while a heritability of 1 means entirely genetic influence.  In reality, most traits have heritabilities somewhere in between. | Example: The heritability of height is high, meaning genes play a significant role in determining how tall a person will be. = 身高的遗传性很高，这意味着基因在决定一个人的身高方面起着重要作用。

The heritability of intelligence is a complex and debated topic. = 智力的遗传性是一个复杂且备受争议的话题。|近义词：heritability coefficient, genetic influence |反义词：environmental influence


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The heritability of eye color is relatively high. = 眼色的遗传性相对较高。
High heritability doesn't necessarily mean that a trait is unchangeable. = 高遗传性并不一定意味着性状是不可改变的。


一般过去时:
Studies showed a high heritability for schizophrenia in twin studies. = 双生子研究表明精神分裂症的遗传性很高。
Researchers investigated the heritability of various diseases. = 研究人员调查了各种疾病的遗传性。


现在完成时:
Scientists have estimated the heritability of many human traits. = 科学家已经估计了许多人类性状的遗传性。
Recent studies have shown that environmental factors also play a role. = 最近的研究表明，环境因素也起着作用。


过去完成时:
Before the study, they had underestimated the heritability of the trait. = 在研究之前，他们低估了该性状的遗传性。
Scientists had already established some basic principles of heritability. = 科学家们已经建立了一些遗传性的基本原理。


将来时:
Future research will explore the interaction between genes and environment. = 未来的研究将探索基因和环境之间的相互作用。
We will likely find that heritability varies across populations. = 我们可能会发现遗传力在不同人群中有所不同。


虚拟语气:
If the heritability were higher, the trait would be more predictable. = 如果遗传性更高，该性状将更容易预测。
I wish we had a better understanding of the heritability of complex traits. = 我希望我们对复杂性状的遗传性有更好的理解。


被动语态:
The heritability of this trait has been extensively studied. = 这一性状的遗传性已被广泛研究。
The results were interpreted as showing a moderate heritability. = 结果被解释为显示中等遗传性。


疑问句:
What is the heritability of this particular disease? = 这种特定疾病的遗传性是多少？
How is heritability measured and interpreted? = 如何测量和解释遗传性？


否定句:
The heritability of this trait is not solely determined by genes. = 这一性状的遗传性并非仅仅由基因决定。
It is not always easy to separate genetic and environmental effects. = 将遗传效应和环境效应分开并不总是容易的。
