词源:

The word "minidress" is a compound word.  "Mini" is a shortened form of "miniature," meaning very small.  "Dress" is the standard word for a garment worn by women.  Therefore, "minidress" literally means a very small dress.  The term emerged in the fashion world in the 1960s, reflecting the popularity of shorter hemlines during that era.
