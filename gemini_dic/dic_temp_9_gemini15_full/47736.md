decahedra:/ˌdekəˈhiːdrə/| n. |十面体|A decahedron is a three-dimensional geometric shape with ten flat faces.  It can be regular (all faces are congruent regular polygons) or irregular (faces are not all congruent or regular).|Example:  The crystal exhibited a complex decahedral structure.  这个晶体呈现出复杂的十面体结构。|近义词：polyhedron (more general term)|反义词：None (but could be contrasted with shapes having different numbers of faces)|名词


USAGE->
