This word is a compound word:

* **pseudo-**  (/ˈsuːdoʊ/): This prefix is derived from the Greek word ψευδής (pseudēs), meaning "false" or "sham."

* **Spanish** (/ˈspænɪʃ/): This refers to the language and culture of Spain.

Therefore, "pseudo-Spanish" literally means "false Spanish" or "fake Spanish".  There is no specific grammatical usage for the word itself as it functions as an adjective modifying a noun.  It does not conjugate or decline.  The usage is always descriptive.
