词源:
The word "controls" comes from the Old French word "contreroller," meaning "to check, to counter-roll."  This ultimately derives from the Latin "contra" (against) and "rotulus" (a roll, scroll).  Originally referring to a counter-check on accounts, the meaning broadened to encompass the general sense of overseeing and managing.  The verb form developed naturally from the noun's meaning of exercising power or authority.
