词源:
The word is a compound of "pseudo" (from Greek ψευδής, meaning "false" or "sham") and "Bohemian," referring to the artistic and unconventional lifestyle traditionally associated with Bohemia (a historical region of Central Europe).  The term thus describes those who imitate the outward appearance of Bohemians without possessing their inner qualities.
