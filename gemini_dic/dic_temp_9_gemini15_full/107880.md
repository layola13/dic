词源:
The word "largition" is derived from the Late Latin word *largitĭo*, which means "a giving, bestowing, gift".  This, in turn, comes from the Latin verb *largīrī*, meaning "to bestow freely, to give generously".  The word ultimately shares roots with the Latin adjective *largus*, meaning "abundant, ample, large".
