词源:
The word "deposit" comes from the Old French word "depositer," which means "to place down."  This in turn derives from the Latin "deponere," meaning "to put down, lay down," formed from "de-" (down, away) and "ponere" (to put, place).  The sense of placing money in a bank is a later development of the original meaning.
