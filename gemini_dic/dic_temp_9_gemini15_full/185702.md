词源:
The word "reversing" comes from the verb "reverse," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "riverser," meaning "to overturn" or "to turn upside down."  This in turn has roots in the Latin word "vertere," meaning "to turn." The prefix "re-" indicates a repetition or reversal of the action.
