词源:
The word "cutlery" ultimately derives from the word "cutler," which refers to a person who makes or sells knives.  The suffix "-ery" indicates a place or collection of things, therefore "cutlery" refers to a collection of cutting implements and other eating utensils.  The evolution shows a shift from a focus on the maker to the tools themselves.
