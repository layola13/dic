The word "forold" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis following the requested format is impossible.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or archaic dialect.  More context is needed to understand its intended meaning.
