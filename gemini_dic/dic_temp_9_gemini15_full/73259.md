PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "forelocked".  The word is primarily descriptive.


词源:

The word "forelocked" combines "fore-" (meaning "in front," "before," or "at the front of") and "locked" (referring to hair that is hanging down or gathered).  Therefore, it literally describes hair in front of the forehead.  The "locked" portion likely alludes to the appearance of hair hanging in place.
