词源:
The word "ingraftment" is derived from the verb "ingraft," which itself comes from the Old English "in" (in) + "graft" (a branch of a plant inserted into another plant). The "-ment" suffix indicates a process or result.  The meaning has evolved to encompass the broader context of transplanting biological materials, not just plant grafts.
