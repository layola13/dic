词源:

The word "imprisoning" is derived from the verb "imprison," which itself comes from the Old French word "emprisoner," meaning "to put in prison."  The prefix "em-" (later "en-," and then "im-") is an Old French prefix meaning "in," and "prison" comes from the Old French "prison," ultimately from the Latin "prehensio," meaning "a seizing, capture."  Thus, "imprisoning" literally means "the act of putting into a seizure or capture."
