词源:
* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation, but not a complete identity.
* **anxiously**: From "anxiety," ultimately derived from Latin *angustiae*, meaning "narrowness, distress."  It reflects a feeling of worry, nervousness, or unease.

Therefore, "quasi-anxiously" combines the sense of "almost" or "seemingly" with the feeling of anxiety, creating a nuanced description of a state of mild or hesitant worry.
