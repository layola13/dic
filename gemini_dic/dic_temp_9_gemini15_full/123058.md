词源:
From Medieval Latin *monetarius, from Latin moneta ("money"), from the name of the Roman mint on the Capitoline Hill, dedicated to Juno Moneta ("Juno the Warner").  The word ultimately derives from the Latin verb monēre ("to warn," "to remind"), referring to the warnings issued by Juno.  The connection lies in the fact that the mint warned people about the value of coins.
