词源:

The word "desert" comes from the Old French word "desert," meaning "wilderness" or "uninhabited region."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "desertum," the past participle of "deserere," meaning "to abandon" or "to forsake."  Thus, the dual meaning of "desert" (as a noun referring to a barren land and as a verb meaning to abandon) reflects its etymological roots.
