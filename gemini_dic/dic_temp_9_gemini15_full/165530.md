词源:

The word "premanifesting" is a relatively modern coinage, combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") with the verb "manifesting" (from "manifest," meaning "to show clearly").  The root of "manifest" can be traced back to the Latin word "manifestus," meaning "evident, clear, plain."

用法说明:

"Premanifesting" is used to describe something that gives advance indications or hints of a future event or condition. It implies a subtle or indirect revelation, often before the full extent of the event becomes apparent.  It is primarily used in formal or technical contexts.  It’s not a frequently used word in everyday conversation.
