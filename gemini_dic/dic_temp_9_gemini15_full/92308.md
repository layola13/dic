WORD ORIGIN->
The word "hypnoses" is the plural form of "hypnosis."  "Hypnosis" derives from the Greek word "hypnos" (ὕπνος), meaning "sleep."  The suffix "-osis" indicates a process or condition. Therefore, "hypnosis" literally translates to "the state of sleep" or, more accurately, "a sleep-like state." The term's evolution reflects the historical association of hypnosis with a sleep-like condition, though modern understanding considers it a state of heightened suggestibility rather than true sleep.
