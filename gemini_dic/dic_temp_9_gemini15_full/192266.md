词源:
The word "screenable" is derived from the verb "screen," which originally referred to a sieve or a protective covering.  Over time, its meaning evolved to include the act of examining or selecting, often figuratively, as in "screening a movie" or "screening applicants." The "-able" suffix indicates capability or suitability.
