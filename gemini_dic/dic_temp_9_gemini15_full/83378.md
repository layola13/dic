gyrostat:/ˈdʒaɪrəʊstæt/ | n. |陀螺稳定器，回转仪 | A gyrostat is a device that uses the principles of gyroscopic motion to maintain stability or orientation. It typically consists of a rapidly spinning rotor mounted in gimbals, allowing it to maintain its orientation even when subjected to external forces.  This property is used in various applications, such as navigation systems and stabilizing platforms. | Example: The ship's gyrostat helped maintain its course despite the stormy seas.  The satellite uses a gyrostat for attitude control. | 近义词：gyroscope, stabilizer | 反义词：destabilizer
