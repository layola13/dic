cathode:/ˈkæθoʊd/| n. |阴极|The cathode is the negatively charged electrode in an electrochemical cell or vacuum tube. It attracts positive ions or electrons. |例句：Electrons flow from the cathode to the anode in a battery.  电子从电池的阴极流向阳极。|例句：The cathode ray tube was a key component in early televisions. 阴极射线管是早期电视机的关键部件。|近义词：negative electrode|反义词：anode


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The cathode attracts positive ions. = 阴极吸引正离子。
The cathode emits electrons. = 阴极发射电子。

一般过去时:
The cathode attracted positive ions. = 阴极吸引了正离子。
Scientists studied the cathode ray. = 科学家研究了阴极射线。

现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the cathode extensively. = 科学家们已经广泛研究了阴极。
The cathode has emitted many electrons. = 阴极已经发射了许多电子。

过去完成时:
They had already tested the cathode before the experiment. = 他们在实验前已经测试过阴极了。
The cathode had been damaged before the experiment. = 阴极在实验前就已经损坏。

将来时:
We will use a new cathode in the next experiment. = 我们将在下一次实验中使用新的阴极。
The cathode will emit more electrons at higher voltage. = 在更高的电压下，阴极将发射更多的电子。

虚拟语气:
If the cathode were stronger, it would last longer. = 如果阴极更强，它就会更耐用。
I wish the cathode were working properly. = 我希望阴极能正常工作。

被动语态:
The cathode was damaged during the test. = 阴极在测试过程中受损。
The cathode is being replaced. = 阴极正在被更换。

疑问句:
What material is the cathode made of? = 阴极是由什么材料制成的？
Is the cathode connected correctly? = 阴极连接正确吗？

否定句:
The cathode is not working properly. = 阴极工作不正常。
The electrons are not flowing from the cathode. = 电子没有从阴极流出。


PHRASE->
cathode ray = 阴极射线
cathode sputtering = 阴极溅射
cathode material = 阴极材料
cathode protection = 阴极保护
cathode luminescence = 阴极发光
