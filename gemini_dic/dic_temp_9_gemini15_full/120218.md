词源：
The word "mine" comes from the Old French word "mine," meaning "a mine," which in turn originates from the Latin word "minea," meaning "a mine, a tunnel."  The Latin word likely derives from the verb "mināre," meaning "to undermine, to dig," suggesting the inherent action of excavating from the earth.
