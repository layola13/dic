USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "hello".  Therefore, tense conjugations are not applicable.  The word itself describes an action (a volley of fire), not a verb that can be conjugated.


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "musketade".  The word is quite specific to historical military contexts.
