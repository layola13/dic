The word "dependingly" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  The word appears to be an attempt to create an adverb from the word "depending," which itself is a present participle acting as an adverb.

To illustrate how one might analyze a similar, correctly formed word, let's use the adverb "dependently":

dependently: /dɪˈpɛndəntli/ | adv. | 依赖地，依靠地 | In a dependent manner; relying on something or someone else. | The child acted dependently, always needing his mother's help.  The project's success is dependently tied to securing funding. | independently, autonomously | self-sufficiently
