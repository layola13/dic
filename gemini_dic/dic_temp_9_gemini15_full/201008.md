词源:
The word "slog" likely originates from the Old Norse word "slōgr," meaning "a blow," or a similar word of Germanic origin.  The sense of "to hit hard" evolved into the sense of "to work hard" and "to walk heavily." The transition reflects the arduous nature of both hitting something hard and undertaking strenuous physical work or travel.
