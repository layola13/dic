parthenogenesis:/ˌpɑːrθənoʊˈdʒɛnɪsɪs/| n. |孤雌生殖；单性生殖|The process of reproduction in which an organism develops from an unfertilized egg.  This is a natural form of asexual reproduction in which growth and development of embryos occur without fertilization. Many plants and some invertebrate animals reproduce through parthenogenesis. | Example:  Many species of insects reproduce through parthenogenesis.  许多昆虫物种通过孤雌生殖进行繁殖。


Example:  The aphids in my garden reproduce by parthenogenesis during the summer months. 我花园里的蚜虫在夏季通过孤雌生殖繁殖。|近义词：asexual reproduction, virgin birth|反义词：sexual reproduction
