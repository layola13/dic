extrudability: /ˌɛkˈstruːdəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可挤压性，挤出性 | The ability of a material to be extruded.  This refers to how easily a material can be forced through a die to create a specific shape.  Factors affecting extrudability include the material's viscosity, temperature, and the presence of any additives. |  The high extrudability of this polymer makes it ideal for producing thin films.  这种聚合物的良好挤出性使其非常适合生产薄膜。

The extrudability of the clay was affected by its moisture content. 粘土的可挤压性受其含水量的影响。 |  近义词：formability, moldability | 反义词：inextensibility, unworkability

词源:

Extrudability is derived from the verb "extrude," which comes from the Latin verb "extrudere," meaning "to thrust out" or "to push out."  The suffix "-ability" indicates the capacity or potential for something.  Therefore, extrudability signifies the capacity of a substance to be extruded.
