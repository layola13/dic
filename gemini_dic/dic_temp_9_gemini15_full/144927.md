The word "over-wideness's" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be an incorrect or non-standard formation.  It seems to be attempting to combine "over-wideness" (itself a relatively uncommon word) with a possessive 's.

Let's break down the potential components:

* **Over-wideness:** /ˌoʊvərˈwaɪdnəs/ | n. |过度宽广；过于宽阔| Excessive breadth or width. This word is not frequently used and might be replaced with more common alternatives depending on context.  It suggests something is wider than is necessary or desirable.

    * Example:  The over-wideness of the road made it difficult to navigate.  = 道路过于宽阔，难以通行。


Since "over-wideness's" is grammatically incorrect, we cannot provide a full analysis as requested in the format.  To analyze a word properly, it needs to be a legitimate word in the English language.  The possessive 's is inappropriately applied to "over-wideness."  One might use "the over-wideness of..." to express possession or relationship.


Instead of attempting to analyze this non-existent word, let's look at how to correctly express the idea of excessive width and its attributes:


**Possible Correct Usages:**

* **The road's excessive width:** This is a grammatically correct way to express the concept.
* **The excessive width of the road:**  This is another grammatically correct option.
* **The over-broadness of the design:** This uses a synonym for "over-wideness" and is more common.
* **The superfluity of space:** This focuses on the excess rather than just the width.


To illustrate different grammatical aspects, we will use the phrase "excessive width":
