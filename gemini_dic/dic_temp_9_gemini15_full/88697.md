词源:The word "hobbit" was coined by J.R.R. Tolkien himself.  Its etymology is not explicitly stated, but it's believed to be a combination of elements suggesting a small, homely creature.  Some speculate that it might derive from "hob" (a mischievous sprite or goblin) and the suffix "-bit," which might imply smallness.  The precise origin remains a matter of scholarly debate, highlighting the author's creative word-building.
