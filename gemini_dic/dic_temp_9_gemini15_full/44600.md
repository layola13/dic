词源:
The word "crowd" ultimately derives from the Old Norse word "krūda," meaning "a company, a troop, a multitude."  This Old Norse word is related to the Old English word "crūde," which has a similar meaning.  The evolution from "krūda" to "crowd" reflects typical sound changes in the English language over time.
