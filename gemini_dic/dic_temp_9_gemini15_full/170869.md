WORD ORIGIN->
The word "pseudohypertrophic" is a compound word derived from three Greek roots:

* **pseudo-**:  (Greek ψευδής, *pseudēs*) meaning "false" or "falsely appearing."
* **hyper-**: (Greek ὑπέρ, *hupér*) meaning "over," "above," or "excessive."
* **trophic-**: (Greek τροφή, *trophē*) meaning "nourishment" or referring to growth or development.


Therefore, "pseudohypertrophic" literally means "falsely overgrown" or "appearing to be excessively nourished (in terms of growth), but not actually so."  The term accurately reflects the condition where muscles look larger due to fat and connective tissue, rather than actual muscle growth.
