词源:  The word "clearcut" is a compound word.  "Clear" means free from obscurity or ambiguity, and "cut" here implies a decisive or complete action or separation.  It developed its current meaning through the evolution of the use of "cut" to describe decisive actions.  The original meaning likely related to a clean, precise cut, which then extended metaphorically to describe clarity and decisiveness in other contexts.
