词源:
The word "hitchhike" is a combination of "hitch," meaning "to catch or fasten," and "hike," meaning "a long walk."  The original meaning referred to catching a ride by attaching oneself or one's belongings to a vehicle.  Over time, it evolved to describe the practice of seeking rides from passing vehicles.
