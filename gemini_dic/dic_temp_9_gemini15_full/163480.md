precontrolling: /ˌpriːkənˈtroʊlɪŋ/ | adj. | 预先控制的；预先控制的 |  Describes something that involves controlling or managing something before it happens or begins.  It suggests proactive measures to prevent problems or ensure a desired outcome. This is not a standard dictionary word; it's likely a newly coined term or a less common usage.  Therefore, providing comprehensive grammatical examples and phrases is difficult.  Its meaning is derived from the combination of "pre-" (before) and "controlling." | 例句：The company implemented a precontrolling system to manage inventory levels and prevent shortages. 公司实施了一个预先控制系统来管理库存水平并防止短缺。
