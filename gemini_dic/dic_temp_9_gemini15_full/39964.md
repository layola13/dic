词源:  From the verb "construe," ultimately from Latin "construere" (to build, construct),  combining "con-" (together) and "struere" (to build, pile up).  The noun form "construer" developed as a result of the verb's use in interpreting meaning, linking the act of building with the act of understanding and interpreting.
