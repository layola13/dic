conics:/ˈkɑːnɪks/| n.|圆锥曲线|The study of conic sections, including circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas.  Conics are curves formed by the intersection of a plane and a cone. They have many applications in mathematics, physics, and engineering. |Example: We learned about the properties of conics in geometry class. 我们在几何课上学到了圆锥曲线的性质。|近义词：conic sections|反义词：无
