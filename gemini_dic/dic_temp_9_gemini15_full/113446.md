近义词：mob killings, extrajudicial killings, summary executions |反义词：legal executions, due process


词源:  The term originates from the name of Charles Lynch (1736-1796), a Virginia justice of the peace who, during the American Revolutionary War, used summary justice on Loyalists, often involving whipping or other punishments.  This practice spread, and the term "lynching" eventually came to refer specifically to the extrajudicial killing of individuals, often by hanging, typically motivated by racial hatred or other forms of prejudice.  The practice was particularly prevalent in the American South following the Civil War.
