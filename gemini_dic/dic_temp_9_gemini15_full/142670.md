词源:
The word "ostrich" comes from the Old French "autruche," which in turn derived from the Latin "avis struthio."  "Avis" means "bird," and "struthio" is of Greek origin, referring to a type of large bird.  The word's evolution reflects its long history and the bird's prominence across different cultures.
