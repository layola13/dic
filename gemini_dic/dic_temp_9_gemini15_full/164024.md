The word "predisagreed" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word, or a misspelling.  It seems to be an attempt to combine "pre-" (meaning before) and "disagreed" (meaning to have a difference of opinion).

Therefore, a full analysis following your requested format is impossible.  However, we can analyze the constituent parts:


**pre-**

/priː/ | prefix | 预先，在…之前 |  Used to indicate something that comes before something else in time or order. |Example: pre-planning, pre-game, pre-existing.


**disagreed**

/ˌdɪs.əˈɡriːd/ | verb | 不一致，有分歧 | To have a different opinion or belief than someone else. | Example:  They disagreed about the best way to solve the problem.  他们对解决这个问题的最佳方法意见不一。


To illustrate how one might use a similar concept, let's analyze a phrase that conveys a similar meaning:

**Pre-existing disagreement:**

/ˌpriː.ɪɡˈzɪs.tɪŋ ˌdɪs.əˈɡriː.mənt/ | noun phrase | 事先存在的意见分歧 | A disagreement that existed before a particular event or situation. | Example: The project was plagued by pre-existing disagreements among team members.  该项目受到团队成员之间事先存在的分歧的困扰。
