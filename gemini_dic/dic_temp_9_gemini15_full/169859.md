prosenchyma: /prɒˈsɛŋkɪmə/ | n. | 薄壁组织 | Parenchyma-like tissue, especially in the stems of certain plants.  It refers to a type of plant tissue composed of relatively unspecialized cells with thin walls, large vacuoles, and often containing chloroplasts. Unlike collenchyma and sclerenchyma, it lacks significant structural support roles. | Example: The prosenchyma in the stem provided some support but its primary function was storage. | 近义词: parenchyma (though prosenchyma is a more specific term) | 反义词: collenchyma, sclerenchyma |  词性: 名词
