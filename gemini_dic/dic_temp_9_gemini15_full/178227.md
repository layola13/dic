The word "recompared" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full analysis following your requested format is impossible.  However, we can analyze what it *might* mean based on its component parts: "re-" and "compared."

**re-**:  /riː/ | prefix | 再，重新，重复 |  Indicates repetition or reversal of an action.

**compared**: /kəmˈpeərd/ | v. (past participle of compare) | 比较，对照 | To examine (two or more objects, ideas, people, etc.) in order to discover similarities or differences.


If "recompared" were to exist, it would likely mean one of the following:

1. **Compared again:**  The process of comparison was repeated.

2. **Compared differently:** The comparison was conducted using a different method or criteria.

3. **Re-evaluated by comparison:** The subject was re-examined in light of a comparison with something else.


Because it's not a standard word, providing grammatical usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or common phrases is not possible.  To properly analyze a word, it needs to be a valid entry in a reputable dictionary.  If you encountered this word in a specific context, providing that context will help determine its intended meaning.
