词源:
The word "properly" derives from the adjective "proper," which comes from the Old French "propre" and ultimately from the Latin "proprius," meaning "one's own," "belonging to oneself," "peculiar," or "special."  Over time, "proper" acquired the meaning of "suitable," "fitting," "correct," and "right," leading to the adverbial form "properly," which emphasizes the manner or way in which something is done correctly or appropriately.
