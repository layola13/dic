PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly incorporating "nonpassive" as it's a grammatical term, not a common word in everyday speech.  However, phrases illustrating active voice (the opposite of passive) could be used:

actively pursuing = 积极追求
taking the initiative = 主动采取行动
doing the work = 做这项工作
making a decision = 做出决定
taking charge = 负责


词源:
The word is a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "passive".  "Passive" comes from the Latin word "passivus," meaning "suffering," "enduring," or "receiving action."  Therefore, "nonpassive" literally means "not suffering" or "not receiving action" in a grammatical context.
