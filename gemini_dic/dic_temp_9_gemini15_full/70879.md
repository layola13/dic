The word "finos" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries. It's likely a word from another language or a misspelling.  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.  If you can provide context (e.g., the sentence where you encountered the word, the language it might be from), I may be able to offer a more helpful response.
