factorization: /ˌfæktəraɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 因式分解，因子分解 | The process of finding the factors of a number or expression.  It involves breaking down a number or expression into smaller components that, when multiplied together, give the original number or expression.  This is a fundamental concept in mathematics, particularly in algebra and number theory. |

例句：

The factorization of 12 is 2 x 2 x 3.  | 12 的因式分解是 2 x 2 x 3。

The factorization of x² - 4 is (x - 2)(x + 2). | x² - 4 的因式分解是 (x - 2)(x + 2)。
