noncognitions:/ˌnɒnˈkɒɡnɪʃ(ə)nz/ | n. |非认知性陈述，非认知判断 |Statements or judgments that do not express beliefs or facts, but rather emotions, attitudes, or commands.  Noncognitivism is a meta-ethical theory that holds that moral judgments are not factual claims and therefore cannot be true or false. | Example: "Boo!" expresses disapproval, but isn't a statement that can be true or false.  "Close the door!" is a command, not a factual assertion. |近义词：expressions of emotion, commands, imperatives |反义词：cognitions, beliefs, factual statements |名词
