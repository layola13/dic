USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a descriptive manner within botanical contexts. It doesn't lend itself to typical verb conjugations or grammatical variations like the example word "what".  Therefore, providing examples for tenses, moods, and voices is inappropriate.  The word functions as a simple descriptor.

PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "hexandria".  The term is highly specialized.
