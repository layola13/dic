The word "heatedness's" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be an incorrect or non-standard formation.  "Heatedness" is a word, but adding "'s" creates a grammatically problematic possessive form.  Let's analyze "heatedness" instead:


heatedness: /ˈhiːtɪdnəs/ | n. | 热度；激动；激烈 | The state or quality of being heated; intense feeling or excitement. |  例句：The heatedness of the debate surprised everyone.  这场辩论的激烈程度让每个人都吃惊。 The heatedness of the argument made it difficult to find a resolution.  争论的激烈使得很难找到解决方案。| 近义词：intensity, fervor, passion, excitement | 反义词：calmness, coolness, indifference
