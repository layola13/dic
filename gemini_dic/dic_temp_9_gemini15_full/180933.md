reiki:/ˈreɪkiː/| n.| 灵气疗法 |Reiki is a Japanese technique for stress reduction and relaxation that also promotes healing. It is based on the idea that an unseen "life force energy" flows through us and is what causes us to be alive. If one's "life force energy" is low, then we are more likely to get sick or feel stress, and if it is high, then we are more capable of being happy and healthy.  The techniques used in Reiki healing are simple and safe to practice. |She received Reiki treatment to alleviate her back pain. 她接受了灵气疗法来缓解背痛。|近义词：energy healing, therapeutic touch|反义词：无
