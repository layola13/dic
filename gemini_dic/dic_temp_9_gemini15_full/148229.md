Word Origin:

The word "oversimplenesses" is formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to the word "oversimpleness".  "-nesses" is a suffix that forms plural nouns from adjectives or nouns, indicating a state or quality. "Oversimpleness" itself is formed from "oversimple", which combines the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessive") with "simple".  Therefore, the word's origin traces back to the adjective "simple" with the addition of prefixes and suffixes to modify its meaning and grammatical function.
