/ˌnɒn kəmˈpaʊndə(r)/ | adj. | 非复合词的；不构成复合词的 |  A non-compounder is a word that does not readily combine with other words to form compound words.  It typically resists compounding in a given language. For example, in English, "happy" is a compounder (happy hour, happy birthday), while many less common words may be non-compounders. The determination of whether a word is a non-compounder is often context-dependent and can vary across linguistic analysis. |  The word "serendipity" is considered a non-compounder in English because it doesn't easily form compound words. |  There is no direct antonym, but the opposite concept would be a "compounder" (a word that readily forms compounds). | adj.
