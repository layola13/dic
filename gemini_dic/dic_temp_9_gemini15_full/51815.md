dewclaw:/ˈduːklɔː/| n.| 悬爪，狼爪 |A dewclaw is a rudimentary digit, typically found on the inside of the front legs of many dogs and some other animals. It's a vestigial claw, meaning it's a leftover from an evolutionary ancestor and serves little or no purpose in modern animals. While some breeds have dewclaws surgically removed, others keep them.  |例句：My dog's dewclaw got caught on a fence. 我的狗的悬爪被栅栏卡住了。

例句：The veterinarian examined the dog's injured dewclaw. 兽医检查了狗受伤的悬爪。


近义词：vestigial claw, spurious claw
