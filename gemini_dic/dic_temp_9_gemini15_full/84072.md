/hɑːfˈhɛʒən/| n.| 半海森矩阵 | A half-Hessian matrix is a matrix that contains only the lower triangular part (or upper triangular part) of the Hessian matrix.  It's used in optimization algorithms, particularly those involving second-order derivatives, to reduce computational cost and memory usage since the Hessian matrix is symmetric. | Example:  In some optimization problems, using the half-Hessian instead of the full Hessian can significantly speed up the computation.  在一些优化问题中，使用半海森矩阵代替完整的海森矩阵可以显著加快计算速度。 |近义词: lower triangular Hessian, upper triangular Hessian|反义词:full Hessian matrix|名词
