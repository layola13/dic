epizoan:/ˈɛpɪzoʊæn/| n. |寄生物；外寄生动物 |An epizoan is an animal that lives on the surface of another animal.  It is a type of parasite, but specifically one that lives on the exterior of its host.  This differs from an endoparasite, which lives inside the host's body.  Epizoans can be found in various aquatic environments, and their relationships with their hosts can range from commensal (neither harming nor benefiting the host) to parasitic (harming the host).| Example: Barnacles are common epizoans found on whales and other marine animals.  鲸鱼和其他海洋动物身上常见的寄生物是藤壶。|近义词：parasite, ectoparasite |反义词：host, endoparasite |名词
