USAGE->
This word doesn't have verb conjugations like "what" in English.  It functions only as a noun.  Therefore, typical verb tenses are not applicable.

PHRASE->
Bwanas is not typically used in phrases in the same way "what" is in English.  It's a standalone term of address.  Examples incorporating it into a phrase would be dependent on the Swahili sentence structure.
