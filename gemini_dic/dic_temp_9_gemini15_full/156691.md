pidginizations:/ˌpɪdʒɪnaɪˈzeɪʃənz/ | n. | 皮钦语化；混合语化 | The process by which a pidgin language develops and is adopted by a community as its primary language.  It involves the simplification and standardization of the language, often incorporating elements from multiple source languages.  This process is often driven by the need for communication between groups with different linguistic backgrounds. | Example: The pidginizations of English in various parts of the world resulted in the development of creole languages.  世界各地英语的皮钦语化导致了克里奥尔语的发展。 | 近义词：creolization, language mixing, linguistic simplification | 反义词：language standardization (in the sense of eliminating pidgin or creole elements)
