overflutter:/ˌoʊvərˈflʌtər/ | n. | 过度颤动；剧烈颤动 |  Excessive fluttering or vibration, often implying instability or malfunction.  The term is typically used in engineering contexts, particularly relating to aerospace and mechanical systems. | Example: The aircraft experienced overflutter during high-speed maneuvers, leading to structural damage.  飞机在高速机动过程中发生了过度颤动，导致结构损坏。|近义词：vibration, oscillation, shaking | 反义词：stability, steadiness


USAGE->
一般现在时:
