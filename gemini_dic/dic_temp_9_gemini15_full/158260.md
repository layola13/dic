词源:
The word "play-off" is a compound word formed from "play" and "off."  "Play" refers to a game or match, and "off" signifies a separate or additional competition, typically to resolve a tie or determine a winner among equally ranked teams.  The combination suggests a distinct series of games played separately from the regular season.
