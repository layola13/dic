词源:
The word "delinquent" comes from the late Middle English word "delinquent," which is derived from the past participle of the Latin verb "delinquere," meaning "to fail, to be negligent, to offend."  The Latin verb is composed of "de-" (away, off) and "linquere" (to leave). Thus, the original sense implies leaving undone or neglecting a duty.
