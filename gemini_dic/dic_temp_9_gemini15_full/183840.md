词源:
The word "research" comes from the Old French word "recerche," meaning "a search or quest."  This in turn derives from the Old French verb "recercher," meaning "to search again, to seek diligently."  The prefix "re-" indicates repetition or intensification, while the root "cerche" is related to the Latin word "circare," meaning "to go around, to search."  Therefore, "research" literally means a thorough and repeated search for information.
