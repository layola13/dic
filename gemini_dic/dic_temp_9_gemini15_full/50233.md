词源:
The word "dependably" is derived from the adjective "dependable," which itself comes from the verb "depend."  "Depend" ultimately traces back to Old French "depender" and further to Latin "dependere," meaning "to hang down from."  The "-ably" suffix is an adverbial ending indicating "in a ... manner."  Thus, "dependably" signifies "in a dependable manner."
