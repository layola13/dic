词源：

The word "pro-army" is a compound word.  "Pro-" is a prefix meaning "in favor of" or "supporting," derived from Latin "pro," meaning "for" or "before." "Army" comes from Old French "armee," ultimately from Latin "armata," the feminine past participle of "armare," meaning "to arm."  Thus, "pro-army" literally means "in favor of the army."
