/ˌloʊzəˈbɪlnɪsəz/ | n. | 可丢失性；可丧失性 |  The word "losablenesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a non-standard or invented word formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to "losable," attempting to create a plural noun form signifying multiple instances of something being losable.  However, "losable" itself is already an adjective describing something that can be lost. Therefore, "losablenesses" is redundant and grammatically awkward.  To express the idea of multiple things being losable, one would use the phrase "multiple losable items" or a similar construction. |  There are no standard examples or usages because the word is not a legitimate part of the English language. | 近义词:  loss potential, vulnerabilities (in the context of things that are at risk of being lost) | 反义词:  security, irreplaceability | n.
