反义词：fresh, sweet-smelling, delicate


词源:  From Middle English *gamyn, from Old English *gam, meaning "game" (as in hunted animals).  The sense of "strong smell" developed from the association with the characteristic smell of game meat, which could be quite strong if not properly preserved. The sexual connotation is a later development, arising from the association of "game" with playful or adventurous behavior.
