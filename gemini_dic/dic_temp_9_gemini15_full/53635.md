词源:

Discernment comes from the Old French word *descernement*, meaning "discrimination, distinction," which itself originates from the verb *descerner*, meaning "to discern, distinguish."  The Latin root is *discernere*,  a compound of *dis-* ("apart") and *cernere* ("to separate, distinguish, decide").
