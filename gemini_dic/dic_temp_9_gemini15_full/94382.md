词源:
The word "implead" comes from the Old French word "enpleder," meaning "to plead," which itself derives from "pleder," meaning "to plead." The prefix "im-" is a variant of "in-," indicating "in" or "into."  Therefore, "implead" literally means "to bring into a plea" or "to bring into a legal action."
