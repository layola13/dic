micromillimetre:/ˌmaɪkroʊˈmɪlɪmiːtər/ | n. |微米 |A micromillimetre is a unit of length equal to one millionth of a millimetre (10⁻⁶ mm) or one billionth of a metre (10⁻⁹ m).  It is rarely used in practice because it is such a small unit.  The preferred unit for such small measurements is the nanometre (nm).| The size of a typical atom is measured in micromillimetres.|近义词: nanometre (nm),  |反义词:kilometre, metre
