词源:  The word "jemminess" appears to be a relatively recent and informal coinage. It's likely derived from the adjective "jemmy," meaning cheerful, pleasant, or friendly.  The "-ness" suffix is a common English suffix added to adjectives to create nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.  There's no established etymological record for "jemminess" in major dictionaries.  Its usage suggests a playful and informal extension of existing language.
