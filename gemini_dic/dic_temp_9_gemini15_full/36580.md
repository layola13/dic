词源:
The word "collate" comes from the Medieval Latin word "colligere," meaning "to gather together" or "to collect."  This in turn derives from the Latin prefix "col-" (together) and "legere" (to gather, read).  The meaning evolved from the original sense of gathering things together to the more specific sense of arranging things in order, particularly documents.
