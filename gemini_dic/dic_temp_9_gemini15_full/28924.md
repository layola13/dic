carrier-wave:/ˈkæriər weɪv/| n. |载波|A carrier wave is a wave, usually a sine wave, that is modulated (changed) to carry information.  It is used in radio broadcasting and other communication systems to transmit signals over long distances. The information signal is superimposed onto the carrier wave, altering some characteristic of the wave (like its amplitude or frequency) to encode the data. After transmission, a receiver demodulates the carrier wave to extract the original information.  |Example:  Radio stations use carrier waves to transmit audio signals to listeners' radios.  无线电台使用载波将音频信号传输到听众的收音机。


The information signal, such as audio or video, is too weak to travel long distances on its own, so it needs a stronger carrier wave to "carry" it.  信息信号（例如音频或视频）本身太弱，无法自行传播很远的距离，因此它需要更强的载波来“携带”它。|近义词：baseband, support signal|反义词：None specifically, but concepts like "information signal" are contrasting.
