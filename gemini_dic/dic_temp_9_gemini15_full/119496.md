microperthitic: /ˌmaɪkroʊpərˈθɪtɪk/ | adj. | 微斜长石的 |  Describing a type of perthitic texture in rocks where the exsolution lamellae (thin layers of different minerals) of albite within orthoclase are very fine-grained and only visible under a microscope.  It refers to a specific type of intergrowth of two feldspar minerals, orthoclase and albite, where the albite is in the form of very fine, microscopic inclusions within the orthoclase. |  The thin section revealed a microperthitic texture in the feldspar.  = 薄片显示长石具有微斜长石结构。  The microperthitic texture is indicative of slow cooling of the magma. = 微斜长石结构表明岩浆冷却缓慢。 | perthitic, cryptoperthitic |  macroperthitic  | adj.


USAGE->
(Since "microperthitic" is an adjective,  it doesn't have verb conjugations like the example word "what".  Instead, examples will demonstrate its usage in different sentence structures.)

Declarative Sentence:
The rock sample exhibits a microperthitic texture. = 岩石样本呈现微斜长石结构。
The feldspar is described as microperthitic in the geological report. = 地质报告中将长石描述为微斜长石的。


Interrogative Sentence:
Is the texture of this feldspar microperthitic? = 这种长石的结构是微斜长石的吗？
Could the microperthitic inclusions indicate a specific geological event? = 微斜长石包裹体能否指示特定的地质事件？


Exclamatory Sentence:
How remarkably fine the microperthitic lamellae are! = 微斜长石的纹理多么精细！
Look at this microperthitic texture under the microscope! = 在显微镜下看看这种微斜长石结构！


Comparative Sentence:
The microperthitic texture is finer than the perthitic texture. = 微斜长石结构比斜长石结构更精细。
