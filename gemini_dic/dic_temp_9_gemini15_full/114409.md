词源:
The phrase "make fun of" combines the verb "make" (to create or cause something) and the noun phrase "fun of," where "fun" refers to amusement or mockery, and "of" indicates the target of the amusement.  The phrase's evolution is tied to the development of the word "fun" as a noun meaning amusement or playful activity, which emerged in the 16th century. The phrasing reflects a common pattern of English idiom construction where a verb is used to describe the act of causing something, in this case, the causing of amusement at another's expense.
