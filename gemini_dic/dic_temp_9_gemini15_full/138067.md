词源:
The word "normalise" comes from the word "normal" + the suffix "-ise" (a suffix used to form verbs from adjectives or nouns).  "Normal" originates from the Latin word "normalis," meaning "perpendicular," "according to rule." Over time, its meaning broadened to refer to what is typical, average, or standard.
