cutwater: /ˈkʌtwɔːtər/ | n. |切水器；船首水线；分水线 | The sharp, forward-projecting part of a ship's hull designed to slice through the water.  It minimizes resistance and allows for efficient movement through the water.  Also refers to a similar feature on other watercraft or structures. | Example: The ship's cutwater cleanly parted the waves. 这艘船的船首水线干净利落地劈开波浪。  The cutwater of the dam was heavily reinforced.  水坝的分水线得到了大量的加固。|近义词：bow, prow (referring to the front of a ship)|反义词：stern (the rear of a ship)|名词


Etymology:  The word is a compound of "cut" and "water," reflecting its function of cutting through the water.  Its usage can be traced back to the early development of shipbuilding.
