词源:
The word "redemption" comes from the Middle English word "redempcioun," which is derived from the Old French word "redempcion" and ultimately from the Latin word "redemptio," meaning "a buying back" or "deliverance."  The Latin word is formed from "re-" (again) and "emere" (to buy).  Thus, the core meaning revolves around the act of buying something back, which has expanded to encompass spiritual and moral contexts as well.
