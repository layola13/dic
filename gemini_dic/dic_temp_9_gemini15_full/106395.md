The word "kookoom" is not found in standard English dictionaries or etymology resources.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), slang, or specific to a certain dialect or community.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide the requested format, I'll need a valid word.
