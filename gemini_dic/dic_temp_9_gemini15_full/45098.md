词源:
The word "cuckolded" derives from the now-obsolete word "cuckoo," referring to the cuckoo bird's habit of laying its eggs in other birds' nests.  This behavior was associated with the idea of a husband unknowingly raising another man's child, leading to the metaphorical use of "cuckoo" and subsequently "cuckolded" to describe a man whose wife is unfaithful.
