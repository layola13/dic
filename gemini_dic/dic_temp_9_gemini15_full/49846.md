词源:
The word "demoralized" comes from the verb "demoralize," which itself is derived from the French word "démoraliser," meaning "to corrupt the morals of."  The prefix "de-" indicates removal or deprivation, while "moral" refers to character or principles.  Therefore, "demoralize" literally means to take away someone's morale or spirit, leading to the adjective "demoralized."
