词源:

The word "conceitedness" is derived from the adjective "conceited," which comes from the Middle English word "conceited," meaning "having a high opinion of oneself."  This, in turn, is related to the verb "conceit," meaning "to imagine" or "to form an opinion."  The ultimate origin lies in the Old French word "conceit," and ultimately from the Latin "concipere," meaning "to conceive" or "to grasp mentally."
