词源:

The word "nonintellectualness" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), the adjective "intellectual" (relating to intellect or intelligence), and the suffix "-ness" (forming nouns of state or quality).  Therefore, it directly derives from the word "intellectual" and its meaning is its direct opposite.  The word "intellectual" itself has roots in Latin, deriving from "intellectus," the past participle of "intellegere," meaning "to understand."
