词源:
The word "caress" comes from the Old French word "caresser," meaning "to stroke," "to fondle," or "to caress."  This, in turn, is derived from the Vulgar Latin word "carescere," which is likely related to the Latin word "carus," meaning "dear," "beloved," or "precious."  Thus, the original sense implied a touching that was affectionate and valued.
