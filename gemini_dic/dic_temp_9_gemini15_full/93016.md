idiothermic: /ˌɪdiəʊˈθɜːrmɪk/ | adj. | 自温性的，内温性的 |  Relating to or denoting animals that regulate their body temperature by internal metabolic processes, rather than by relying on external sources of heat.  This term is largely obsolete and has been replaced by "endothermic". | Example:  While the term "idiothermic" is rarely used now, it once described animals that maintain their body temperature internally.  |近义词: endothermic | 反义词: ectothermic, poikilothermic |


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The lizard is basking in the sun to regulate its body temperature. = 蜥蜴正在晒太阳以调节体温。
This bird maintains a constant internal body temperature. = 这只鸟保持恒定的内部体温。


一般过去时:
The snake sought warmth on a rock to raise its body temperature. = 蛇在岩石上寻找温暖以提高体温。
The hibernating bear's body temperature dropped significantly. = 冬眠的熊的体温下降了很多。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered that many animals regulate their body temperature through internal mechanisms. = 科学家们已经发现许多动物通过内部机制调节体温。
The researchers have observed how this species maintains a stable internal temperature. = 研究人员观察了这个物种如何保持稳定的内部温度。


过去完成时:
The reptile had already warmed itself before it became active. = 爬行动物在活跃之前就已经使自己暖和起来了。
The mammal had maintained a constant body temperature throughout the night. = 哺乳动物整夜都保持着恒定的体温。


将来时:
The animal will use metabolic heat to maintain its body temperature in the cold. = 动物将利用代谢热量在寒冷中维持体温。
The experiment will show how the animal regulates its internal temperature. = 实验将展示动物如何调节其内部温度。


虚拟语气:
If the animal were ectothermic, it would be more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations. = 如果动物是外温动物，它将更容易受到温度波动的影响。
I wish I knew more about how this species regulates its internal temperature. = 我希望我能更多地了解这个物种如何调节其内部温度。


被动语态:
The animal's body temperature is regulated by internal metabolic processes. = 动物的体温由内部代谢过程调节。
The experiment's results were interpreted to show how internal temperature is maintained. = 实验结果被解释为显示如何维持内部温度。


疑问句:
How does this animal maintain its internal body temperature? = 这只动物如何维持其内部体温？
Is this species endothermic or ectothermic? = 这个物种是内温动物还是外温动物？


否定句:
This reptile does not rely on external sources of heat to regulate its body temperature. = 这条爬行动物不依赖外部热源来调节体温。
The research did not support the hypothesis that the animal was poikilothermic. = 研究不支持该动物是变温动物的假设。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "idiothermic" as it's an obsolete term.  The term "endothermic" is now preferred and used in scientific contexts.  Examples of phrases using "endothermic" include "endothermic reaction," "endothermic animal," and "endothermic process."
