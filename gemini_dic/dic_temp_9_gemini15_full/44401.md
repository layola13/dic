词源:

The word is a compound adjective formed from:

* **cross-**:  meaning "intersecting," "lying across," or "in a diagonal position."  This element originates from Old English *cris, crūc*  meaning "cross."

* **handled**: This is the past participle of the verb "to handle," referring to something having a handle or handles. "Handle" comes from Old English *handel*, related to the Old Norse *handla*.


The combination creates a clear description of an object with handles that intersect or cross each other.
