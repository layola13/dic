词源:

The word "naturalising" comes from the verb "naturalize," which is formed from the noun "nature" + "-alize" (meaning "to make or become like").  "-alize" is a suffix frequently used to create verbs indicating the process of making something like something else (e.g.,  "modernize," "hospitalize").  The overall meaning evolved from the original sense of making something like nature to include the legal process of granting citizenship.
