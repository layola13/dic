词源:

The word "castrators" comes from the Latin word "castrare," meaning "to cut off," "to mutilate," or specifically "to emasculate."  This verb gave rise to the noun "castrator," meaning one who performs castration.  The English word is a direct borrowing of the Latin term with the addition of the "-or" suffix to indicate an agent or doer of the action.
