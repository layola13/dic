词源：

* **self-**:  Prefix meaning "of or relating to oneself."  From Old English *self.

* **abomination**:  Noun meaning "a thing that causes disgust or hatred." From Old French *abominacion, from Latin *abominationem, from *abominari ("to abhor, detest").  The Latin root involves the prefix *ab- ("away from") and *ominari ("to foretell, to speak ill of").  Thus, originally it implied something that was considered an ill omen or something to be shunned.
