dissipativity:/ˌdɪsɪˈpeɪtɪvɪti/| n. |耗散性，弥散性 |The property of a system that allows energy to be dissipated or lost to the environment;  the tendency of a system to lose energy over time.  It's often studied in physics, engineering, and even economics. |例句：The high dissipativity of the system led to a rapid decrease in its energy.  这个系统的耗散性很高，导致其能量迅速下降。


The dissipativity of the shock absorber reduced the vibrations. 减震器的耗散性降低了振动。|近义词：dispersion, dissipation, decay |反义词：conservation, preservation


USAGE->

词源:
The word "dissipativity" is derived from the verb "dissipate," meaning to disperse or scatter.  The suffix "-ivity" indicates a state or quality.  Therefore, "dissipativity" refers to the state or quality of being dissipated.  The root "dis-" implies removal or separation, while "sip-" relates to drinking or scattering. Thus, the overall meaning points to the spreading or scattering of something, in the context of energy or other properties.
