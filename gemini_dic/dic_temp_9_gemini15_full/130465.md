词源:
The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "abstemiously," which comes from "abstemious"  (meaning "sparing or moderate in eating and drinking").  Therefore, "nonabstemiously" means "not sparingly or moderately; indulging freely."  The root is ultimately from the Latin "abstemius," meaning "temperate."
