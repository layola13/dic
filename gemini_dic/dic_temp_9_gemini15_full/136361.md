词源:

The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "respectable."  "Respectable" originates from the verb "respect," ultimately deriving from the Latin "respectus," a past participle of "respectare," meaning "to look at, regard, consider."  Therefore, "nonrespectable" literally means "not looked upon with respect."
