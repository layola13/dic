panchayats:/pʌnˈtʃaɪæts/| n. |村委会；村议会|The word "panchayat" is derived from the Sanskrit words "pancha" (five) and "ayat" (assembly).

They play a crucial role in local governance, particularly in rural areas, handling issues ranging from infrastructure development to dispute resolution. | Example: The village panchayat met to discuss the new irrigation project.  村委会开会讨论新的灌溉项目。|近义词：village council, local government, community council |反义词：central government, national government
