词源:

The term "skiffled" originates from the English word "skiff," a small boat.  The verb usage evolved to describe the casual, improvisational nature of movement and music, like drifting in a small boat.  The musical association particularly emerged in the mid-20th century with the rise of skiffle music, a genre characterized by its informal, often improvised nature, and use of readily available instruments.
