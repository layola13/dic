nucleobases:/ˈnjuːkliəʊbeɪsɪz/| n. |核碱基|Nucleobases are the fundamental building blocks of nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA. They are nitrogen-containing compounds that are responsible for carrying genetic information.  There are five main nucleobases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), thymine (T), and uracil (U).  Adenine, guanine, and cytosine are found in both DNA and RNA, while thymine is found only in DNA and uracil is found only in RNA.|The sequence of nucleobases in DNA determines the genetic code, which directs the synthesis of proteins and other cellular components. |近义词：nitrogenous base|反义词：无
