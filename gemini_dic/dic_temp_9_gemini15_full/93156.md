The ignipotent mixture required only a spark to cause a significant explosion. (这种具有点燃潜能的混合物只需要一个火花就能引起巨大的爆炸。)

近义词：flammable, combustible, incendiary (in the sense of potential) | 反义词：fireproof, incombustible, non-flammable | 词性: adjective


词源:  The word is a blend of "igni-" (from Latin "ignis," meaning "fire") and "-potent" (from Latin "potens," meaning "powerful" or "able").  It's a relatively rare and modern coinage, not found in standard dictionaries, but constructed logically from established roots.
