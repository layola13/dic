PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "plasterinesses". The word itself is used to describe a collection of artificial or insincere acts.  Phrases would involve describing the instances of plasteriness, not the word itself as a unit.  For example:

"The numerous plasterinesses of his campaign were ultimately his downfall." (他的竞选活动中大量的虚饰最终导致了他的失败。)

WORD ORIGIN->

The word "plasterinesses" is derived from "plasteriness," which in turn comes from "plaster."  "Plaster" originally referred to a material used to coat surfaces, implying a superficial covering.  The "-iness" suffix transforms the adjective "plastery" (having the characteristics of plaster) into a noun, referring to the quality or state of being plastery.  The final "-es" adds the plural, indicating multiple instances of this quality.  Therefore, the word's evolution traces back to the idea of a superficial or artificial covering, leading to its current meaning of insincerity or affectation.
