词源:

The word "overstridency" is a relatively modern coinage, formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the noun "stridency."  "Stridency" itself comes from the adjective "strident," which originates from the Latin word "stridēre," meaning "to creak" or "to grate."  This suggests a harsh, grating quality, which is reflected in the meaning of "stridency" and its derivatives.


用法说明:

Overstridency refers to a quality of being excessively strong, harsh, or prominent. It implies an overemphasis or an unpleasant loudness.  The word is typically used to describe opinions, statements, or behaviors that are too forceful or assertive, often to the point of being offensive or irritating.  It carries a negative connotation.

例句:

The overstridency of his political rhetoric turned many voters away. 他激烈的政治言论吓退了许多选民。

Her overstridency in demanding immediate action created tension in the room. 她强烈要求立即采取行动，导致房间里气氛紧张。
