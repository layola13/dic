quasars:/ˈkwɑːzɑːrz/| n. |类星体|Extremely luminous and distant celestial objects, believed to be powered by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies.  They are among the most distant and luminous objects in the universe, emitting vast amounts of energy across the electromagnetic spectrum.| Example:  Astronomers are studying the quasars to understand the early universe. 天文学家正在研究类星体以了解早期宇宙。  The observed redshift of quasars indicates their immense distance. 类星体的观测红移表明了它们巨大的距离。|近义词：active galactic nuclei (AGN)|反义词：无
