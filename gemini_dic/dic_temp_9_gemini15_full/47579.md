WORD ORIGIN->
The word "debasednesses" is derived from the verb "debase," which comes from the Old French word "debasir," meaning "to lower, degrade, or devalue."  The suffix "-ness" indicates a state or condition.  Therefore, "debasednesses" refers to the state or condition of being debased, encompassing multiple instances or aspects of degradation, corruption, or devaluation.
