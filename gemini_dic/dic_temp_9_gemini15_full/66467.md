词源：

From Latin *exsequiōsus, from exsequī "to follow," "to attend to,"  ultimately from *sequi "to follow."  The sense shifted from "attentive" to "excessively attentive" to the point of servility.


用法说明：

Exequious is primarily used as an adjective to describe someone who is excessively and often insincerely attentive or submissive to someone in authority or power, often to gain favor or advantage. It carries a negative connotation, implying flattery and a lack of genuine respect.  It is less common than synonyms like obsequious but emphasizes the servile aspect.  The word is rarely used in modern English.
