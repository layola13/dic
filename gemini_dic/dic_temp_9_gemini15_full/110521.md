词源:
The word "limbless" is formed from the word "limb" (meaning a projecting part of an animal body, such as an arm or leg) + "-less" (a suffix indicating the absence of something).  The root of "limb" can be traced back to Old English "lim," related to Old High German "lim" and Old Norse "lim," all meaning "limb, member."
