词源:
The word "exposing" comes from the verb "expose," which originates from the Old French word "exposer," meaning "to put forth," "to set forth," or "to display."  This in turn derives from the Latin word "exponere," which is a combination of the prefix "ex-" (out, from) and "ponere" (to place, to put).  Therefore, the core meaning of "expose" has always been about bringing something out into the open.
