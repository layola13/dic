词源:
The word "focussing" comes from the Latin word "focus," meaning "hearth" or "fireplace."  In optics, it referred to the point where rays of light converge. The meaning then extended to the point of concentration or attention.  The "-ing" suffix indicates the present participle or gerund form of the verb "focus."
