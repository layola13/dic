fugacity:/fjuˈɡæsɪti/| n.|逸度，逃逸性|The fugacity of a substance is a measure of its tendency to escape from a particular phase of matter.  It is a thermodynamic concept that corrects the partial pressure of a gas to account for deviations from ideal gas behavior.  Fugacity is particularly important in dealing with non-ideal gases and solutions where the partial pressure is not a reliable indicator of the escaping tendency.|例句：The fugacity of the gas increased with pressure. 气体的逸度随着压力的增加而增加。

The fugacity of water vapor in the atmosphere is crucial for understanding cloud formation. 大气中水蒸气的逸度对于理解云的形成至关重要。|近义词：escaping tendency, chemical potential|反义词：N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The fugacity of this gas is high. = 这个气体的逸度很高。
The fugacity coefficient is calculated using this equation. = 逸度系数使用该方程计算。


一般过去时:
The fugacity of the system decreased after the reaction. = 反应后系统的逸度降低了。

否定句:
The fugacity is not directly measurable. = 逸度不能直接测量。
The fugacity of the ideal gas is equal to its partial pressure.  = 理想气体的逸度等于其分压。(This is a negative statement in the context of non-ideal gases)


PHRASE->
fugacity coefficient: 逸度系数
fugacity of water: 水的逸度
fugacity calculations: 逸度计算

partial fugacity: 分逸度


词源:
The word "fugacity" is derived from the Latin word "fugere," meaning "to flee" or "to escape."  This reflects the concept's association with the tendency of a substance to escape from a given phase.
