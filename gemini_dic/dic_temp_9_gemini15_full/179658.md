词源:
The word "reengross" is formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "anew") to the verb "engross," which itself originates from the Old French word "engrosser" meaning "to write in a large hand, to make a large copy of (a document)," ultimately deriving from the Latin "grossus" meaning "thick, large."  Thus, "reengross" literally means "to make large again," or more figuratively, "to become completely absorbed again."
