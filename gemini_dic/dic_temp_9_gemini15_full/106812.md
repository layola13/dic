labipalpus:/ˌlæbɪˈpæl.pəs/ | n. |下唇须|The labipalpus is a pair of sensory appendages located on the labium (lower lip) of insects, particularly in the orders Diptera (flies) and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths).  They are typically segmented and covered with sensory hairs or sensilla, which play a crucial role in detecting food sources, mates, and other environmental stimuli.  The structure and morphology of the labipalpus can vary significantly between different insect species, providing valuable taxonomic characteristics. |The butterfly used its labipalpus to taste the nectar before feeding. 蝴蝶用它的下唇须品尝花蜜后再进食。|近义词: labial palp |反义词:  (无明确反义词,  可考虑 maxillary palpus as a contrasting structure)|名词
