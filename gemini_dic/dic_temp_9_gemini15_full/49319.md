词源:  Derived from the adjective "delightful," which itself comes from the verb "delight" (meaning to give great pleasure). The suffix "-fulness" adds the meaning of "the state or quality of being."  Ultimately, "delight" traces back to Old English *de-līhtan, meaning "to lighten, brighten," suggesting a connection between pleasure and a sense of illumination or joy.
