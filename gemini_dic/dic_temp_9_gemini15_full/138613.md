nuclear-force:/ˈnjuːkliər fɔːrs/ | n. | 核力 | The strong force that holds protons and neutrons together in the nucleus of an atom.  It is one of the four fundamental forces in nature. | Example: The nuclear force is responsible for the stability of atomic nuclei. 核力负责原子核的稳定性。  The strength of the nuclear force is crucial in understanding nuclear reactions. 核力的强度对于理解核反应至关重要。 | 近义词: strong nuclear force, strong interaction | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, but concepts like weak force or electromagnetic force could be considered contrasting forces) | 名词

词源:

The term "nuclear force" is a modern compound of "nuclear" and "force".  "Nuclear" derives from the Latin word "nucleus," meaning "kernel" or "nut," referring to the core of an atom. "Force" comes from the Old French word "force," ultimately from the Latin "fortis," meaning "strong."  Therefore, "nuclear force" literally means the strong force within the atom's core.
