词源：
The word "eavesdrop" originates from the Old English words "efese" (eaves of a house) and "dropa" (drop, drip).  Originally, it referred to the act of standing under the eaves of a house to overhear conversations within, often with water dripping from the eaves.  Over time, the meaning shifted to simply mean secretly listening to a conversation.
