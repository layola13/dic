holotricha:/ˌhɒləˈtraɪkə/ | n. | 全毛类 | Holotricha is a taxonomic class within the phylum Ciliophora, encompassing single-celled organisms characterized by having cilia distributed uniformly over their entire cell surface.  These cilia are used for locomotion and feeding. | Example:  The study focused on the diverse species within the class Holotricha, highlighting their unique adaptations.  这项研究关注全毛类中的多样物种，突出了它们的独特适应性。| 近义词: Ciliate (a broader term)| 反义词:  None directly, but terms describing ciliates with specific cilia arrangements (e.g., hypotrich) could be considered contrasting. | 名词
