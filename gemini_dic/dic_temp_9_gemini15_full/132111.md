This word is extremely rare and not found in standard dictionaries. It's formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to "noncritical," which itself is formed from the prefix "non-" and the adjective "critical."


* **non-:**  A prefix meaning "not," "opposite of," or "lacking."
* **critical:**  Adjective meaning  "expressing adverse or disapproving comments or judgments," or "of, relating to, or constituting a turning point or crucial stage." It can also mean "essential to the success or survival of something."


Therefore, "noncritical" means "not critical," "unimportant," or "not essential."  Adding "-nesses" creates a plural noun referring to multiple instances or aspects of being noncritical.  The word suggests a collection of unimportant or unessential factors.


Given the rarity, there are no readily available examples showing grammatical usage in different tenses.  The word's meaning is straightforwardly derived from its constituent parts.  The usage would be similar to other abstract plural nouns:


* **Example in a sentence (similar structure):** The report detailed the various noncriticalnesses that could be overlooked. (报告详细说明了可以忽略的各种非关键因素。)


The word is highly unlikely to be encountered in everyday conversation or writing.  More common and natural alternatives exist to express the same idea, such as "unimportant matters," "nonessential aspects," or simply "trivialities."
