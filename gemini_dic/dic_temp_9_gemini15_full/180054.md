词源:

The word "reflective" comes from the verb "reflect," which originates from the Latin word "reflectere," meaning "to bend back," "to turn back," or "to throw back."  The prefix "re-" indicates "back" or "again," and "flectere" is related to the verb "flectere," meaning "to bend." Thus, the original meaning was about bending or turning something back, which evolved to include the sense of light or sound bouncing back (reflection) and later, the metaphorical sense of thinking deeply and considering things carefully.
