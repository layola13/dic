词源:

The word "overcredulously" is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much"), the adjective "credulous" (meaning "having or showing too great a readiness to believe things"), and the adverbial suffix "-ly".  "Credulous" itself derives from the Latin word "credulus," meaning "trusting," "believing," or "easy to believe."  The root is "credere," meaning "to believe."
