hypergeneticalness: /ˌhaɪpərˌdʒɛnɪˈtɪkəlnəs/ | n. | 超遗传性 | The state or quality of being hypergenetical;  a hypothetical property referring to a characteristic that is influenced by factors beyond the direct influence of genes, such as epigenetic modifications or environmental factors.  This word is extremely rare and not commonly used in standard English. Its usage is largely limited to highly specialized academic contexts, particularly in fields exploring the complex interactions between genes, environment, and phenotype. |  There are currently no readily available examples of this word used in a sentence because of its rarity and highly specialized nature.  The word itself is a neologism, meaning it's a newly coined word. | 近义词: (No direct synonyms exist due to the word's rarity and specialized meaning.  Concepts related to epigenetics or phenotypic plasticity might be considered conceptually similar.) | 反义词: (No direct antonyms exist; the opposite would imply a characteristic solely determined by genes and unaffected by external factors, which is a simplification.) | n.
