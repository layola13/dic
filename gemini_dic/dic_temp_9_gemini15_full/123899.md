词源:
The adverb "mordantly" derives from the adjective "mordant," which comes from the Old French word "mordant," meaning "biting."  This, in turn, originates from the Latin verb "mordēre," meaning "to bite."  The original sense referred to a substance that bites or corrodes, like a strong acid.  The figurative extension to biting wit or sarcasm developed later.
