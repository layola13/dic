词源:
The word "commiserator" derives from the verb "commiserate," which comes from the Late Latin word "commiserari."  "Commiserari" is formed from the prefix "com-" (meaning "together" or "with") and "miserari" (meaning "to pity" or "to feel pity"). Therefore, "commiserate" originally meant "to share in pity" or "to feel pity together."  The suffix "-tor" is added to create the noun form "commiserator," indicating the person who performs the action of commiserating.
