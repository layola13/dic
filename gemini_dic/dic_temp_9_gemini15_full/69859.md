ferromagnetism:/ˌferoʊˈmæɡnɪtɪzəm/| n. |铁磁性|A property of certain materials that allows them to be strongly attracted to a magnet and to retain their magnetism after the external magnetic field is removed. This is due to the alignment of the magnetic moments of atoms within the material.|例句：Iron exhibits strong ferromagnetism. 铁表现出很强的铁磁性。The ferromagnetism of the material makes it suitable for use in magnets.  该材料的铁磁性使其适用于磁体。|近义词：ferrimagnetism|反义词：diamagnetism, paramagnetism

词源:
The word "ferromagnetism" is a combination of "ferro," derived from the Latin word "ferrum" meaning "iron," and "magnetism," referring to the properties of magnets.  The suffix "-ism" indicates a characteristic or doctrine.  Therefore, ferromagnetism literally means "the magnetism of iron."
