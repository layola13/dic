词源:

The word "mindblowing" is a relatively modern compound word.  It combines "mind" (referring to the intellect or consciousness) with "blowing," which in this context implies a forceful impact or overwhelming sensation. The "blowing" is metaphorical; it doesn't literally mean something is blowing the mind.  The origins trace back to the common experience of being so surprised or impressed that one feels overwhelmed mentally.
