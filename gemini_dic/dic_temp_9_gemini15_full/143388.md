The word "outfigure" does not exist as a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word with limited usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  If you meant a different word, please provide the correct spelling.
