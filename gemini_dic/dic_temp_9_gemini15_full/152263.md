词源：源自动词patronize，其词根是patron（保护人，资助人）。最初含义是“以顾客身份光顾”，后来引申出“以高人一等的态度对待”的含义。  The word ultimately derives from the Latin word *patronus*, meaning "protector," "defender," or "sponsor."  The shift in meaning reflects a change in the relationship between patron and client, from one of mutual respect to one of condescension.
