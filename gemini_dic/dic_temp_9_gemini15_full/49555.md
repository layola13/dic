词源：

The word "demeaning" comes from the verb "demean," which itself has a complex history.  The original meaning of "demean" was to "behave" or "conduct oneself."  Over time, it took on a negative connotation, meaning to lower oneself in status or dignity, or to behave in a way that is unworthy.  Adding the "-ing" suffix creates the adjective "demeaning," describing something that has this effect of lowering or humiliating.
