词源:
The word "nonoverlapping" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "overlapping" (meaning "partially coinciding").  "Overlapping" itself comes from "overlap," which is formed from "over" (meaning "above, beyond") and "lap" (meaning "to lie over or upon").  Therefore, the entire word implies a lack of coincidence or intersection.
