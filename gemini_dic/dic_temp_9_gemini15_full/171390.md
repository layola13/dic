词源:
The word "pucker" originates from the Middle English word "pokeren," meaning "to poke or thrust,"  which in turn is likely related to the Old French word "pouquer," having similar meaning.  The modern sense developed through a semantic shift, associating the action of poking or thrusting with the creation of wrinkles or folds.
