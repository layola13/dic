**Etymology:**

The word "scope" ultimately derives from the Middle French word "escope," meaning "sweep" or "stroke." This term in turn traces back to the Old French word "escope," which has roots in the Old Norse word "skop," meaning "a cut" or "a slice," as well as the Old High German word "scof," meaning "a cut" or "a notch." The connection lies in the idea of a "scope" defining or delimiting a certain area or range, like a cut or slice through a larger entity.  The verb sense of "to scope" is a more recent development,  borrowing from the noun's established meaning of surveying or examining a range.
