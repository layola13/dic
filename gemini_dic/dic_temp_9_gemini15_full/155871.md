photo-oxidize:/ˌfoʊtoʊˈɒksɪdaɪz/ | vt. | 光氧化；光致氧化 | To undergo or cause to undergo oxidation by exposure to light.  This process often involves the absorption of light by a molecule, leading to the formation of reactive oxygen species that can damage other molecules. |  The dye in the fabric photo-oxidized and faded in the strong sunlight.  这种织物中的染料在强烈的阳光下发生光氧化而褪色。


The pigment photo-oxidized rapidly in the presence of ultraviolet light.  这种颜料在紫外线照射下迅速发生光氧化。| 近义词：photodegrade,  oxidize | 反义词：reduce (in the chemical sense)
