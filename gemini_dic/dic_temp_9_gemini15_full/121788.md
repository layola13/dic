词源:
The word "misrecollection" is formed by combining the prefix "mis-" (meaning "wrong" or "bad") with the noun "recollection" (meaning "the act of remembering something").  "Recollection" itself comes from the verb "recollect" which is from the Old French *recolliger, from re- + colliger (to collect, gather), ultimately from Latin *colligere (to gather together).
