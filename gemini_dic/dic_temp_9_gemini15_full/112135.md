USAGE->
This word has limited usage outside of Scotland and is primarily a noun.  Therefore, verb conjugations etc. are not applicable in the standard way.  The informal uses as a verb ("to looch" meaning to steal or spill)  would follow standard English verb conjugations but lack formal dictionary entries.

There are no common idiomatic phrases using "looch" beyond its core definition.
