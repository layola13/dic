The word "hailse" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure dialect.  To provide the requested analysis, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about its intended meaning and usage.
