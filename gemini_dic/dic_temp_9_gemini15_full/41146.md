copula:/ˈkɒpjʊlə/| /ˈkɑpjələ/ | n. |系动词|A copula is a verb that connects a subject to a predicate, often expressing a state of being, identity, or relationship.  It doesn't describe an action.  The most common copula in English is "to be" (am, is, are, was, were, be, being, been). Other verbs can function as copulas, depending on context. |The dog is happy.  (is connects the subject "dog" to the predicate adjective "happy")  She became a doctor. (became connects the subject "She" to the predicate noun "doctor") |近义词：linking verb |反义词：action verb
