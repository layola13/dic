The word "scrimption" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis following the specified format.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* It's a newly coined word, a neologism, or slang not yet widely recognized.
* It's specific to a particular field or context (e.g., a technical term, jargon, or a fictional word).

If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer a more helpful response.
