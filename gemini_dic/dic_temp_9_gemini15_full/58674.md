词源:
Dumminess derives from the adjective "dummy," meaning stupid or foolish.  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, signifying the state or quality of being dummy. The word "dummy" itself has a complex etymology, potentially related to Old English words suggesting "mute" or "silent,"  suggesting a connection between a lack of verbal articulation and a perceived lack of intelligence.  However, the precise origins remain debated.
