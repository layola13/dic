词源:

The word "self-pity" is a compound word.  "Self" is an Old English word meaning "same" or "one's own," while "pity" comes from the Old French "pitié," ultimately from the Latin "pietas," meaning "dutifulness, piety, reverence."  The combination signifies feeling pity or sorrow specifically for oneself.
