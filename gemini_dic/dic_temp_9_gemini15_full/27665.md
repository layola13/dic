词源:  Derived from the adjective "candid," ultimately from the Latin word "candidus," meaning "shining white," "pure," or "innocent."  The original sense implied a straightforward and unbiased nature, like the brightness of white.  Over time, this evolved into the modern meaning of frank and honest expression.
