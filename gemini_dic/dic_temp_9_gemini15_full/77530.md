由于“gbits”并非一个标准的英文单词，无法按照要求进行解析。  “gbits”可能是“gigabits”的缩写，指的是千兆位。  如果需要解析“gigabits”，则可以提供以下信息：

gigabits:/ˈɡɪɡəbɪts/ | n. |千兆位|A gigabit is a unit of information equal to one billion bits.  It's commonly used to measure data transfer rates and storage capacity.|例句：The internet connection offers speeds up to 1 gigabit per second.  这个网络连接提供高达每秒1千兆位的速度。|近义词：billion bits|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The server transfers data at 10 gigabits per second. = 服务器以每秒10千兆位的速度传输数据。
How many gigabits of data are stored on this hard drive? = 这块硬盘存储了多少千兆位的数据？

一般过去时:
The download speed was 5 gigabits per second yesterday. = 昨天的下载速度是每秒5千兆位。
We transferred 100 gigabits of data last night. = 我们昨晚传输了100千兆位的数据。

现在完成时:
We have downloaded over 1 terabit (1024 gigabits) of data this month. = 这个月我们已经下载了超过1太字节（1024千兆位）的数据。
The company has transferred a massive amount of gigabits of data since its inception. = 自成立以来，该公司已传输了海量的千兆位数据。

过去完成时:
Before the upgrade, the network had only supported up to 100 gigabits. = 在升级之前，网络只支持高达100千兆位。
They had already transferred several terabits (many gigabits) before the system failure. = 系统故障之前，他们已经传输了几太字节（许多千兆位）的数据。

将来时:
The new network will support gigabit speeds up to 1000 gigabits per second. = 新网络将支持高达每秒1000千兆位的速度。
We will need to upgrade our infrastructure to handle the increasing gigabit data transfer. = 我们需要升级我们的基础设施来处理不断增加的千兆位数据传输。


虚拟语气:
If we had more bandwidth, we could transfer data at higher gigabit rates. = 如果我们有更大的带宽，我们可以以更高的千兆位速率传输数据。
I wish our network supported higher gigabit speeds. = 我希望我们的网络支持更高的千兆位速度。


被动语态:
Gigabits of data are transferred across the network every second. = 每秒钟都有大量的千兆位数据通过网络传输。
The data was successfully transferred at a speed of 500 gigabits per second. = 数据以每秒500千兆位的速度成功传输。


疑问句:
How many gigabits are needed to store this video file? = 存储这个视频文件需要多少千兆位？
What is the gigabit transfer rate of this network connection? = 这个网络连接的千兆位传输速率是多少？


否定句:
The network did not support gigabit speeds at that time. = 那时网络不支持千兆位速度。
We haven't yet reached our gigabit transfer target for this month. = 我们这个月的千兆位传输目标尚未达到。


PHRASE->
gigabits per second (Gbps) = 每秒千兆位
gigabit Ethernet = 千兆以太网
gigabit fiber = 千兆光纤
gigabit network = 千兆网络
gigabit connection = 千兆连接


词源：
Gigabit is a combination of "giga," from the Greek prefix "giga-" meaning "billion," and "bit," a shortened form of "binary digit," the smallest unit of data in computing.
