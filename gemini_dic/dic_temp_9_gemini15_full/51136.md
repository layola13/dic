词源:
The word "despoiler" comes from the verb "despoil," which is derived from the Old French word "despoillier," meaning "to strip," "to plunder," or "to rob."  This, in turn, ultimately traces back to the Latin word "expoliare," which is composed of the prefix "ex-" (out) and "polire" (to polish, to smooth, to make bright), suggesting the idea of stripping something of its value or beauty.
