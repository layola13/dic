/mʌlˈtɪʃəs/| adj.|多感觉的，多感觉的；多意识的|The word "multiscious" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word.  It is likely formed by combining "multi-" (meaning many or multiple) and "-scious" (relating to consciousness or awareness).  Therefore, it could be interpreted to mean possessing multiple forms of consciousness or awareness, or having a heightened or multifaceted sensory experience.  However, without a widely accepted definition, its meaning remains ambiguous and context-dependent.|  There are no standard examples or usages as it's not a recognized word.  Its use would depend entirely on the author's intended meaning.|近义词: (depending on intended meaning)  hyperaware, perceptive, sensitive|反义词: (depending on intended meaning) unaware, insensitive, oblivious|adj.
