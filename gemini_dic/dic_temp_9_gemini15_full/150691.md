para-phenylenediamine: /ˌpærəˈfenɪlɛnˈdaɪəmiːn/ | n. | 对苯二胺 |

英文解析:Para-phenylenediamine (PPD) is an organic compound with the formula H₂NC₆H₄NH₂.  It is a diamine, meaning it contains two amine (-NH₂) functional groups.  The "para" prefix indicates that these amine groups are located on opposite sides of the benzene ring.  PPD is a key intermediate in the synthesis of many dyes and pigments, and it's also used as a component in hair dyes.  However, it is a known allergen and can cause contact dermatitis in sensitive individuals.


例句:

Many hair dyes contain para-phenylenediamine, a potential allergen. = 许多染发剂含有对苯二胺，这是一种潜在的过敏原。

The use of para-phenylenediamine in cosmetic products is subject to strict regulations. = 对苯二胺在化妆品中的使用受到严格的监管。


近义词:  (There aren't direct synonyms as it's a specific chemical compound, but related terms could be):  aromatic diamine, benzene diamine

词源:

* **para-:**  From Greek "παρά" (para), meaning "beside," "alongside," or in this chemical context, indicating the 1,4-position on a benzene ring.
* **phenylene:** From "phenyl" (itself from "benzene") referring to the benzene ring structure, and "-ene" indicating a hydrocarbon group.
* **diamine:** From "di-" (two) and "amine," referring to the two amine functional groups.


Therefore, the name describes the chemical structure precisely: a diamine with two amine groups in the para position on a phenylene (benzene) ring.
