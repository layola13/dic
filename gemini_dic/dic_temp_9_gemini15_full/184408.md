词源:  The word "responsibilities" is derived from the adjective "responsible," which in turn comes from the Old French word "responsable," meaning "answerable."  The suffix "-ilities" creates the plural noun form.  The root is the Latin word "respondere," meaning "to answer" or "to reply."  This indicates that responsibilities are things one is accountable for.
