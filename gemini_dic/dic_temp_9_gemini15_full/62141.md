词源:

The word "enclavement" is derived from the noun "enclave" and the suffix "-ment," which forms nouns denoting a process, state, or result.  "Enclave" itself comes from the Old French "enclave," ultimately from the Latin "in-" (in) + "clavis" (key), suggesting something enclosed or locked in.  The sense of a territory enclosed within a larger one developed later.
