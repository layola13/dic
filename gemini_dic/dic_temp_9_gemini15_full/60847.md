electrotonus: /ɪˌlɛkˈtroʊtənəs/ | n. | 电紧张，电紧张现象 |  A sustained alteration in the transmembrane potential of a cell, typically a neuron, caused by the flow of electric current.  This change in potential can be either depolarizing (making the membrane potential less negative) or hyperpolarizing (making it more negative), and it passively spreads along the membrane. Electrotonus is a crucial part of neuronal signaling and underlies several physiological processes.  | Example: The study examined the effects of various drugs on neuronal electrotonus.  这项研究考察了各种药物对神经元电紧张的影响。 | 近义词： membrane potential change, passive spread of potential | 反义词： action potential (in the sense that electrotonus is a passive process, while an action potential is active)

词源:
The word "electrotonus" is a combination of "electro-" (referring to electricity) and "-tonus" (referring to tension or tone).  It reflects the electrical nature of the phenomenon and its effect on the cell's membrane potential.
