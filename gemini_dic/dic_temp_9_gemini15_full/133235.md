词源:

* **non-**:  Prefix meaning "not."
* **exculp-**: From Latin "exculpare," meaning "to clear from blame,"  itself combining "ex-" (out) and "culpa" (fault, blame).
* **-able**: Suffix indicating capability or possibility.

Therefore, "nonexculpable" literally means "not capable of being cleared from blame."
