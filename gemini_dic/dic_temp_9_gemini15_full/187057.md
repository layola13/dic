The word "privatez" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specific technical field or dialect not widely known.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis as requested in the format.  To help me assist you, please double-check the spelling or provide more context where you encountered this word.
