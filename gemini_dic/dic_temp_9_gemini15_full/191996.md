scorifier:/ˈskɔːrɪfaɪər/| n.| 熔渣器，炼渣器 | A scorifier is a shallow, wide, fire-resistant dish used in assaying (the quantitative determination of the constituents of a substance) to oxidize and fuse ores or metallurgical products.  It's often made of bone ash or other refractory materials. | Example: The assayer carefully placed the gold ore into the scorifier before heating it in the furnace.  = 检验员在炉中加热之前，小心地将金矿石放入熔渣器中。 |近义词：crucible (although a crucible is generally deeper)|反义词：None specifically, but the opposite function would be something that *reduces* rather than oxidizes.
