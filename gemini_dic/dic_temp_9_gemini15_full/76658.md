galvani:/ɡælˈvɑːni/| n. |伽伐尼；伽伐尼电池|Galvani is the name of Luigi Galvani, an Italian physician and physicist renowned for his pioneering work on animal electricity.  His experiments, involving the twitching of frog legs when touched by two different metals, laid the groundwork for the understanding of bioelectricity. The term "galvanism" is derived from his name and refers to the electrical phenomena observed in living tissues.|The study of galvanism is important in understanding nerve impulses and muscle contractions. |近义词: volta (in the context of early electrical experiments)|反义词: None specifically.
