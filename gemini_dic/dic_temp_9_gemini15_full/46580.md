USAGE->
This word is quite uncommon and doesn't naturally lend itself to various grammatical tenses in the way a common verb or noun would. The grammatical structures would be applied to sentences *using* the word, not to the word itself.  Therefore, providing examples for all tenses is not appropriate or useful.  Instead, we will show example sentences demonstrating its use.


Example Sentences:

* **Simple Present:** The company's damageablenesses were highlighted in the recent security audit. 公司的弱点在最近的安全审计中被突出显示。
* **Simple Past:**  The engineers analyzed the damageablenesses of the bridge before recommending repairs. 工程师们在建议维修之前分析了桥梁的弱点。
* **Present Perfect:** We have identified several damageablenesses in the software that need to be addressed. 我们已经发现了软件中需要解决的几个弱点。

PHRASE->
There are no common or established phrases specifically using "damageablenesses."  The word itself is a relatively rare and formal construction.  Phrases would be built around the concept of vulnerability or weakness rather than the word itself.  For example, one might use phrases such as:

* **Areas of vulnerability:**  脆弱区域
* **Points of weakness:** 弱点
* **Systemic fragility:** 系统脆弱性
* **Susceptibility to damage:** 易受损害性
* **Critical vulnerabilities:**  关键漏洞


词源:

The word "damageablenesses" is derived from:

* **damage:**  (Old French *damage*, from Latin *damnum*) meaning harm or injury.
* **-able:**  (suffix meaning capable of)
* **-ness:** (suffix forming nouns of state or quality)

Therefore, it literally means "the state or quality of being capable of being damaged," which is often more concisely expressed as vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
