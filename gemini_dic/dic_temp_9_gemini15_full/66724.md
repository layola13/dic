词源:

From Middle French *exorbitance, from Latin exorbitans, present participle of exorbitare "to go out of orbit, stray from the right path," from ex- "out of" + orbita "track, orbit."  The sense development is from "straying from the norm" to "excessive" to "excessively expensive."


用法说明:

Exorbitance is typically used to describe something that is excessively high or expensive, often beyond what is reasonable or expected.  It can also refer to excessive amounts or degrees of something else, such as power or ambition.  It is usually used in a negative context, highlighting the unreasonable or unacceptable nature of the thing being described.

The word is primarily used as a noun.  There is no verb form of "exorbitance."
