The word "simulty" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word not yet widely accepted.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need a correctly spelled word.  If you could provide the intended word, I can happily provide the requested analysis.
