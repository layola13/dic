The word "fecial" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible there's a misspelling or it's a very obscure or archaic term.  If you could provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more accurate analysis or suggest a possible correction.
