词源:

The word "finicking" likely originates from the now-obsolete word "finical," which itself is of uncertain origin.  Some etymologists suggest a possible connection to a now-lost word related to "fine," implying a focus on minute details. Another possible, less certain, etymology suggests a connection to "fink," implying a person who is overly particular or critical.  The evolution from "finical" to "finicking" involved the addition of the "-ing" suffix, transforming the adjective into a more informal and descriptive term.


用法说明:

"Finicking" is primarily used as an adjective to describe someone who is excessively concerned with minor details or who is overly fussy. It often carries a slightly negative connotation, suggesting that the person's attention to detail is excessive and perhaps unproductive.  The word is typically used in informal contexts.
