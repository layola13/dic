nonaspirating: /ˌnɒnˈæspɪreɪtɪŋ/ | adj. | 不送气的 |  Describing a consonant sound produced without a puff of air from the lungs.  This is in contrast to aspirated consonants, which are produced with a strong burst of air.  The difference is often noticeable in English, particularly with the sounds /p/, /t/, and /k/.|


The voiceless stops /p/, /t/, and /k/ are aspirated in English in word-initial position when stressed:  /pʰ/, /tʰ/, /kʰ/.  In other positions, they are often nonaspirated.  For instance, in the word "spin," the /p/ is typically nonaspirated.  Many languages do not aspirate their voiceless stops at all.


例句：

In many languages, the /p/ sound is nonaspirating. = 在许多语言中，/p/ 音是不送气的。

The difference between aspirated and nonaspirating consonants is subtle but significant for phonetics. = 送气和不送气辅音的区别很细微，但对语音学来说意义重大。
