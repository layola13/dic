词源：
The word "ironlike" is a compound word formed from "iron" and the suffix "-like."  "Iron" comes from Old English *īsern, ultimately from Proto-Germanic *īsarną, and is related to words in other Germanic languages referring to iron. The suffix "-like" is a common English suffix indicating resemblance or similarity.  Therefore, "ironlike" literally means "like iron."
