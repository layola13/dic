The word "laia" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is not possible.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  If you can provide context (sentence, language of origin), I may be able to suggest alternatives.
* **A proper noun:**  It could be a name (person, place, or thing).
* **A word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language. If you can tell me the language, I might be able to help.
* **Neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word or a slang term not yet widely recognized.


Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis. Please provide more context.
