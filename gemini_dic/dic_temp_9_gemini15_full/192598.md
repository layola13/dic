词源:
The word "scummier" is derived from the adjective "scummy," which itself comes from the noun "scum."  "Scum" originally referred to the foul matter that forms on the surface of a liquid.  Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass anything considered worthless, undesirable, or morally reprehensible. The suffix "-ier" adds a comparative meaning, indicating a greater degree of the quality described by the base word.
