This word is rarely used in modern English and lacks a clear etymology readily available in standard dictionaries.  It appears to be an archaic or obsolete word, possibly a variant or less common spelling of "discomfort"  with a stronger emphasis on the mental unease rather than physical discomfort.  Further research into historical texts might reveal more about its precise origin and usage.  Because of its rarity, providing examples of its use in different grammatical tenses is impractical.  There are no common phrases associated with this word.
