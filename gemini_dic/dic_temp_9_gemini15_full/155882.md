photoactivation:/ˌfoʊtoʊˌæktɪˈveɪʃən/ | n. | 光活化；光激活 | The process of activating a molecule, protein, or other substance by exposure to light.  This often involves a change in the substance's conformation or activity.  For example,  photoactivation is used in certain types of microscopy and in some therapeutic applications. | Example: Photoactivation of the fluorescent protein allowed us to visualize the specific cells in the tissue.  光活化荧光蛋白使我们能够观察到组织中的特定细胞。


Example:  The drug was designed for photoactivation, requiring UV light to trigger its therapeutic effect.  该药物设计用于光活化，需要紫外线才能触发其治疗效果。


近义词：photostimulation, light activation | 反义词：photoinactivation
