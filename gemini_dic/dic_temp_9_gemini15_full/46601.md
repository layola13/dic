词源:
The word "damasking" ultimately derives from "Damascus," the capital city of Syria.  The city was historically renowned for its production of high-quality steel and intricately patterned textiles, both of which were known as "damask."  The adjective form developed to describe the characteristic patterns and techniques associated with Damascus's craftsmanship.
