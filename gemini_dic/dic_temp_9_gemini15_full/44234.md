词源:

The word "crocodilian" comes from the Late Latin word *crocodilus*, which itself is derived from the Greek word κροκόδειλος (krokodeilos).  The Greek word is a compound of κρόκη (krokē) meaning "pebble" or "gravel" and δειλος (deilos) meaning "worm" or "serpent". The etymology reflects the rough texture of the crocodile's skin and its serpentine movement in the water.
