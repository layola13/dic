词源:
The word "plump" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "plumpen," meaning "to thud" or "to fall heavily."  This in turn is likely related to  words suggesting fullness or roundness in various Germanic languages.  The verb sense of "plumped" developed from the idea of something falling heavily and settling into a full or rounded shape.
