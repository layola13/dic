词源:
The word "heedless" comes from the Old English word "hedian," meaning "to pay attention to," with the addition of the negative prefix "heed-"  (meaning “to pay attention to”) and the suffix "-less" (meaning "without").  Therefore, "heedless" literally means "without heed" or "without attention."
