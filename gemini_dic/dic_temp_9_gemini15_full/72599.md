词源:  The phrase originates from the image of a tool handle literally flying off when the tool is used forcefully or improperly. This image is then metaphorically applied to a person losing control of their temper.  The exact origin is difficult to pinpoint, but the figurative use likely developed in the late 19th or early 20th century.
