/ˌnɒnsəbˈmɪsɪvnəsɪz/| n. |不顺从，不服从；抗拒；不屈服的行为(复数)|The nonsubmissivenesses of the population led to a revolution.  人民的不屈服导致了一场革命。|近义词：defiances, rebellions, resistances|反义词：submissivenesses, compliances


This word is extremely rare and not commonly used in everyday English. It's a plural noun formed from the adjective "nonsubmissive" by adding the plural suffix "-nesses".  The word itself is quite cumbersome.  It would be far more natural to use alternative phrasing in most contexts.


There are no common phrases or idioms using "nonsubmissivenesses".  Because of its rarity, providing examples for grammatical tenses and structures is impractical and artificial. The word itself should generally be avoided in favor of simpler, clearer language.  For example,  instead of "The nonsubmissivenesses of the group were evident," you could say "The group showed clear defiance," or "The group's resistance was obvious."
