词源:  The word "outsallies" is a relatively rare and less common word, formed by combining the prefix "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent than") with the verb "sallies," which itself is an older, less frequently used form of "excel" or "surpass".  While a precise etymological tracing is difficult due to its infrequent use, its meaning is clear from its constituent parts.
