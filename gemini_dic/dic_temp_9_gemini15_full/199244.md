词源:

The word "siloing" comes from the noun "silo," which originally referred to a tall cylindrical structure for storing grain. The metaphorical extension to the organizational context reflects the idea of isolated, self-contained units within a larger system, much like individual silos store grain independently.  The "-ing" suffix transforms the noun into a gerund, representing the act or process of creating or maintaining these isolated units.
