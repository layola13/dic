homoplast:/ˈhoʊməˌplæst/| n.|同形异义词|A homoplast is a character shared by a set of species but not present in their common ancestor.  It is a result of convergent evolution, where similar traits evolve independently in different lineages. Unlike a synapomorphy, which is a shared derived characteristic inherited from a common ancestor, a homoplast is a shared character that arose independently multiple times.|例句：The similar wing structures in birds and bats are examples of homoplasy, as they evolved independently and are not inherited from a common winged ancestor. 鸟类和蝙蝠相似的翅膀结构是同形异义的例子，因为它们是独立进化而来的，并非遗传自共同的带翅膀祖先。|近义词：analogous structure, convergent trait|反义词：synapomorphy, homology
