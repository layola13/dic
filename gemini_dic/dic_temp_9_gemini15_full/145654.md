overcontractions:/ˌoʊvər kənˈtræʃənz/ | n. |过度收缩；过度简缩|The term "overcontractions" refers to the phenomenon in language acquisition where children apply grammatical rules too broadly, resulting in incorrect forms.  For example, a child might say "goed" instead of "went" because they are overgeneralizing the "-ed" past tense marker.  This is a common stage in language development, and usually corrected as the child's linguistic competence improves. |Example:  The child's use of "goed" is an example of overcontraction.  孩子使用“goed”是过度简缩的一个例子。|近义词：overgeneralization, hypercorrection|反义词：undergeneralization
