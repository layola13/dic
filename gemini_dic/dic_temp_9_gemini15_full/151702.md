词源:
Old English *partaken, from Old French participier "to participate," from Latin participāre "to partake," from particeps "sharing," from pars "part" + capere "to take."  The word's evolution reflects a gradual shift from a more direct sense of "sharing" to include the act of participation in activities or events.
