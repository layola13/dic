The word "leville" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (like a place name), or a word from a very specialized jargon.  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more informed response.
