presolve:/priːˈsɒlv/ | vt. | 预先求解；预处理 | To solve or simplify a problem before it is fully defined or before a main algorithm is applied.  This often involves techniques to reduce the size or complexity of a problem before solving it.  Presolving is commonly used in optimization problems, such as linear programming, to improve efficiency. | 例句：The presolve phase significantly reduced the number of variables in the linear program. = 预处理阶段显著减少了线性规划中的变量数量。

The presolver eliminated redundant constraints before the main solver started. = 预求解器在主求解器开始之前消除了冗余约束。


近义词：preprocess, simplify, reduce | 反义词：postprocess, complicate
