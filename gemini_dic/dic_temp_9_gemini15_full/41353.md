coriolis:/kɒˈriəʊlɪs/|ˈkɔːriˌoʊlɪs/| n. |科里奥利力，科氏力 |The Coriolis effect is an inertial or fictitious force that appears to deflect moving objects (like airplanes, wind, missiles, ocean currents etc.) when they are viewed from a rotating frame of reference.  It's caused by the Earth's rotation. |Example: The Coriolis effect influences the direction of winds and ocean currents. 科里奥利效应影响着风和洋流的方向。  The deflection caused by the Coriolis effect is greater at higher latitudes. 科里奥利效应引起的偏转在较高纬度更大。|近义词:inertial force, apparent force|反义词:None|名词
