词源:

The word "reactionist" is derived from the word "reaction," which itself comes from the Latin word "reactio," meaning "a reaction, recoil, rebound."  The suffix "-ist" indicates a person who performs or believes in something.  Thus, a "reactionist" is someone who engages in or advocates for a reaction against progress or change.  The term gained prominence during the 19th and 20th centuries, associated with political and social movements opposing liberalism and progress.
