词源:
The word "discorporate" comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart" or "away") and the word "corporate" (meaning "of or relating to a corporation or incorporated body").  Therefore, it literally means "separated from a corporation" or "not forming a corporation."  The extension of its meaning to the separation of a spirit from the body is a metaphorical usage.
