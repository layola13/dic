词源:
The word "marmoset" ultimately derives from the Old French word "marmouset," which likely originated from a combination of "marmot" (marmot) and a diminutive suffix "-et," suggesting a small marmot-like creature.  The association with marmots may stem from superficial similarities in size and agility.  The word's evolution reflects the changing understanding and classification of these primates over time.
