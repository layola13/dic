The word "numbest" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis following your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word not yet recognized.  To provide a helpful response, I need clarification on the intended word.  Is it a misspelling of another word?  If it's a newly coined term, please provide context so I can attempt an analysis based on that context.
