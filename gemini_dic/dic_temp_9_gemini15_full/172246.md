词源:

The word "pusillanimous" comes from the Late Latin word *pusillus*, meaning "very small, petty, weak," combined with the Latin suffix *-animus*, meaning "mind, spirit, soul."  Therefore, the literal meaning is "small-souled" or "weak-spirited."


用法说明:

Pusillanimous is primarily used as an adjective to describe a person or their behavior. It emphasizes a lack of courage and a tendency toward timidity, often in the face of challenges or danger.  It carries a stronger connotation of weakness and lack of resolve than simply "timid" or "shy."

1.  His pusillanimous refusal to stand up for his beliefs disappointed everyone. 他懦弱地拒绝捍卫自己的信仰，让每个人都失望。
