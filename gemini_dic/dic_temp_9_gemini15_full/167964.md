词源:
The word "prioritised" is the past tense and past participle of the verb "prioritize," which itself is a relatively modern word. It combines the adjective "prior" (meaning "earlier" or "former") with the suffix "-itize," which is used to form verbs meaning "to treat as belonging to a certain category."  The root "prior" traces back to the Latin word "prior," meaning "before" or "former."
