conceit:/kənˈsiːt/| n. |自负；骄傲；奇想；(文学)比喻 |excessive pride in oneself; an excessively favorable opinion of one's abilities, appearance, etc.; a fanciful notion; a witty or ingenious thought or saying; a literary conceit. |例句：His conceit was unbearable.  他的自负令人难以忍受。

例句：The poem is full of elaborate conceits. 这首诗充满了复杂的比喻。


近义词：vanity, pride, egotism, arrogance |反义词：humility, modesty


词源：源自古法语 *conceit,  意为“想法，概念”，  最终源自拉丁语 *conceptus,  过去分词形式，意为“被构思的”，由 *concipere构成，意为“构思，设想”。  其含义演变与英语中许多词语一样，经历了从“想法”到“自负”的转变，因为对自身能力或成就的过高评价往往源于对自身“概念”或“想法”的夸大。
