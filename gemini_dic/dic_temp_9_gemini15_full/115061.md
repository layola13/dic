词源:The word "maneater" is a compound word combining "mane" and "eater."  While the literal meaning would be something that eats manes (the long hair on a horse's neck), the figurative meaning evolved to describe a woman who "devours" or emotionally harms men.  The word's usage reflects historical societal views of women's roles and relationships with men.
