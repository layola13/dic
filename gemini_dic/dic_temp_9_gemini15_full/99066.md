iteration:/ˌɪtəˈreɪʃən/ | n. |迭代，重复，反复 | The process of repeating a set of instructions or a procedure multiple times, often with slight modifications each time.  It's commonly used in computer science, mathematics, and other fields to achieve a desired outcome through successive refinements. | Example: The program uses an iteration to refine the solution until it reaches a certain accuracy.  这个程序使用迭代来改进解决方案，直到达到一定的精度。 |近义词：repetition, reiteration, cycle | 反义词：singularity, uniqueness |  名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The program performs an iteration every second. = 程序每秒执行一次迭代。
This process requires several iterations to complete. = 这个过程需要多次迭代才能完成。


一般过去时:
The last iteration produced a significant improvement. = 上一次迭代产生了显著的改进。
The team completed ten iterations before reaching a consensus. = 团队在达成共识之前完成了十次迭代。


现在完成时:
We have completed three iterations of the design. = 我们已经完成了三个版本的迭代设计。
The algorithm has undergone many iterations since its initial release. = 自从最初发布以来，该算法经历了许多次迭代。


过去完成时:
They had completed five iterations before the deadline. = 他们在截止日期前完成了五次迭代。
Before the final product, there had been numerous iterations of the prototype. = 在最终产品之前，原型经历了多次迭代。


将来时:
We will perform another iteration tomorrow. = 我们明天将进行另一次迭代。
The next iteration will include bug fixes and performance enhancements. = 下一次迭代将包含错误修复和性能增强。


虚拟语气:
If we had more time, we would have done another iteration. = 如果我们有更多时间，我们会进行另一次迭代。
It would be beneficial to perform another iteration before release. = 在发布之前进行另一次迭代将是有益的。


被动语态:
The results were improved after several iterations. = 经过多次迭代后，结果得到了改进。
The software is constantly being improved through continuous iterations. = 该软件通过持续迭代不断改进。


疑问句:
How many iterations are needed to achieve convergence? = 需要多少次迭代才能达到收敛？
What are the parameters for each iteration? = 每次迭代的参数是什么？


否定句:
The first iteration did not produce the expected results. = 第一次迭代没有产生预期的结果。
This process does not require many iterations to achieve its goal. = 这个过程不需要很多迭代就能达到目标。


PHRASE->
iterative process: 迭代过程
iterative development: 迭代开发
iterative refinement: 迭代改进
iterative learning: 迭代学习
iterative design: 迭代设计
