The word "dogal" is not a recognized word in standard English.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown cannot be provided.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a word similar in sound or appearance?
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It could be a newly coined word, a slang term, or a word specific to a particular dialect or community.  More context is needed.
* **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language. If you can provide the language of origin, I might be able to help.


To provide the analysis you requested, I need a correctly spelled and contextually appropriate word. Please provide more information.
