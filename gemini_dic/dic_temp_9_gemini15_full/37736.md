词源:
The word "compartmentalization" is derived from the noun "compartment,"  which in turn comes from the French word "compartiment," meaning "division" or "partition." The suffix "-ization" denotes the process of forming or becoming something.  Therefore, compartmentalization literally means "the process of forming or becoming divided into compartments."
