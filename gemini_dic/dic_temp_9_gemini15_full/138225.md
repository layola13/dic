The word "nosle" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a technical term from a specific field, or a word from a dialect or fictional language.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I may be able to offer a more informed response.
