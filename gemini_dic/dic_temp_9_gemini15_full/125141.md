词源:
The word "multitask" is a combination of "multi-" (meaning "many" or "multiple") and "task" (meaning "a piece of work to be done").  It emerged in the late 20th century as computers and technology allowed for the simultaneous processing of multiple operations.  The verb form reflects the increasing demand for individuals to handle multiple responsibilities simultaneously.
