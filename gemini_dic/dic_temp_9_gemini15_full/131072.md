词源:

The word "nonbearing" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "bearing," which in this context means "capable of carrying weight or load."  "Bearing" itself has roots in Old English "beran," meaning "to carry" or "to bear."  Therefore, "nonbearing" literally means "not carrying" or "not supporting weight."
