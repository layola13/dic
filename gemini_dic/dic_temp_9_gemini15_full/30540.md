cephalophora: /sɛfælˈɒfərə/ | n. | 头足类动物 | Cephalophora is a rarely used term referring to animals with heads.  It's a less common and more technical term compared to the broader category of animals.  The term is largely obsolete in modern zoological classification, as it's not a particularly useful or precise taxonomic group.  It lacks consistent application and doesn't reflect evolutionary relationships effectively. |  Example:  (Difficult to provide a natural example as the term is rarely used in modern context.  A contrived example would be:  The study focused on the cephalophora, noting their diverse head structures.) | 近义词:  (None truly equivalent.  Terms like "animals with heads" are more descriptive but not specific enough.) | 反义词: (None directly opposite.  The antonym would depend on what specific characteristic of "cephalophora" one wants to negate.) | n.
