polycotyledonary: /ˌpɒliˌkɒtɪˈliːdəneri/ | /ˌpɑːliˌkɑːtɪˈliːdənɛri/ | adj. | 多子叶的 | Having or relating to more than two cotyledons.  A cotyledon is a significant part of the embryo within the seed of a plant.  Polycotyledonary plants are relatively rare, compared to plants with two (dicotyledonous) or one (monocotyledonous) cotyledon. | Example:  The pine seed exhibits polycotyledonary characteristics with numerous cotyledons.  松树种子表现出多子叶的特性，具有许多子叶。


The term is derived from the Greek words "poly" (πολύς) meaning "many," "cotyl" (κοτύλη) meaning "cup" or "cavity" (referencing the shape of the cotyledon), and "-edōn" (-ηδών), a suffix indicating a part of an embryo.  The "-ary" suffix indicates that it is an adjective.
