The word "looniest" is the superlative form of "loony," which is a slang term for "crazy" or "insane."  The origin of "loony" is uncertain, but it's likely an alteration of "lunatic," which itself comes from the Latin word "luna" (moon).  The association with the moon stems from the historical belief that mental illness was influenced by lunar cycles.
