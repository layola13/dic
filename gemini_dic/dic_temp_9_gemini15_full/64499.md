erodibility: /ɪˌroʊdəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 易蚀性，可蚀性 | The susceptibility of a material or substance to erosion.  It refers to the ease with which a soil, rock, or other material can be eroded by natural forces such as wind and water. |  The high erodibility of the topsoil led to significant land degradation. 高度易蚀的表土导致了严重的土地退化。 The erodibility of the sandstone cliffs made them vulnerable to coastal erosion. 砂岩悬崖的易蚀性使它们容易受到海岸侵蚀。 |  susceptibility, vulnerability | resistance, stability |  无
