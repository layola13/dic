interconfounding:/ˌɪntərˈkɑːnfaʊndɪŋ/| n. |交互混杂，相互混淆|The term "interconfounding" refers to a situation in statistical analysis where the effects of two or more confounding variables are intertwined and difficult to disentangle.  It describes a complex scenario where the independent variables are not only individually associated with the dependent variable but also correlated with each other, making it challenging to isolate the effect of each independent variable.  This situation frequently occurs in observational studies where researchers cannot randomly assign participants to treatment groups. |Example: In a study examining the relationship between air pollution and respiratory illnesses, interconfounding might occur if both air pollution and socioeconomic status (SES) are related to respiratory illness, and air pollution levels are also correlated with SES.  It would be difficult to determine if the observed effect on respiratory illness is solely due to air pollution or also influenced by SES. |近义词：confounding, interaction effect, collinearity|反义词：orthogonality, independence|名词
