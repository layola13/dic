dynactinometer:/daɪˈnæktɪnɒmɪtər/ | n. | 动力计，测力计 | A dynactinometer is an instrument used to measure the force or power of a muscle or other dynamic system.  It typically involves measuring the force exerted against a resistance.  While the term isn't widely used in modern scientific literature, it reflects the historical interest in measuring muscle power. | Example: The researcher used a dynactinometer to assess the strength of the patient's leg muscles after surgery.  研究人员使用测力计来评估患者术后腿部肌肉的力量。 | 近义词:dynamometer, ergometer | 反义词:None directly applicable.  The antonym would describe a device that *doesn't* measure force, such as a thermometer or speedometer.
