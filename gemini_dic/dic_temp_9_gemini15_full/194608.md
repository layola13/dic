词源：
The word "self-sustenance" is a compound word.  "Self" is a prefix meaning "of, by, or for oneself."  "Sustenance" comes from the Old French word "sustenance," which in turn derives from the Latin word "sustentare," meaning "to hold up, support, or sustain."  Therefore, self-sustenance literally means "self-support" or "self-maintenance."
