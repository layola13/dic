The word "elenctical" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis as requested.  To help you, I need the correct spelling of the word you intended.  If you can provide the correct spelling, I will happily provide the analysis according to your format.
