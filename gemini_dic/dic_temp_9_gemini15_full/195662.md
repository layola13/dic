USAGE->
This word is a relatively uncommon noun and doesn't lend itself to common verb conjugations like "to semiruralize".  The usage primarily focuses on describing a condition or state.  Therefore, tense changes aren't applicable in the same way as with common verbs.


PHRASE->
The word "semiruralism" itself isn't typically used in phrases.  Phrases would likely describe the *characteristics* of semiruralism, rather than the word itself. Examples of relevant phrases would be:

* "a landscape of semiruralism" (半农村化的景观)
* "the challenges of semiruralism" (半农村化带来的挑战)
* "the growth of semiruralism" (半农村化的发展)

词源:  The word "semiruralism" is a modern coinage, combining the prefix "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partly") with "ruralism" (referring to the characteristics of rural life or areas).  "Ruralism" itself is derived from "rural" (relating to the countryside).
