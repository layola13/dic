/njuːroʊkɔːrd/ | n. |神经索；神经脊索 | A neurochord is a hypothetical structure in early chordate development,  a longitudinal cord of cells that is thought to be the precursor to the central nervous system. The existence and exact nature of the neurochord are still debated among scientists.  Research suggests it may be involved in the formation of the neural tube and other structures of the nervous system.  However, direct evidence remains elusive. |The research focused on the development of the neurochord in early embryos.  这项研究的重点是早期胚胎中神经索的发育。|  N/A | N/A |名词
