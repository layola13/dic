词源:
The word "melancholious" comes from the Middle English word "melancolious," which is derived from the Old French "melancolieus."  This, in turn, originates from the Late Latin "melancholicus," ultimately tracing back to the Greek "melankholikos," a combination of "melas" (black) and "chole" (bile). The ancient Greeks believed that an imbalance of black bile caused melancholia.
