gimblets:/ˈɡɪmbləts/| n. |钻孔器；铰链钻头 |A gimlet is a small tool with a pointed screw-like end used for boring holes, especially in wood.  It's typically hand-operated and smaller than a drill bit.  |例句：He used a gimlet to make a pilot hole for the screw. 他用钻孔器为螺丝钻了个导向孔。

例句：The carpenter carefully used the gimlet to create precise holes in the delicate wooden box. 木匠小心地使用钻孔器在精致的木盒上钻出精确的孔。
