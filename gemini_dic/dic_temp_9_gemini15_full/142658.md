词源:
From Ancient Greek ὀστρακισμός (ostrakismos), literally "potsherd" (referring to the pottery shards used in ancient Athenian ostracism).  The practice of ostracism involved writing the name of someone deemed undesirable on a potsherd and casting it into a ballot box; the person with the most votes was exiled for a period of time.
