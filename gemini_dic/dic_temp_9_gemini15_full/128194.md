PHRASE->

Phrases using "neurasthenically" are less common because it's an adverb describing a state rather than participating in common phrasal constructions.  Instead of phrases, it's typically used to modify verbs describing actions or states of being connected to neurasthenia.  For example:

neurasthenically withdrawn: 神经衰弱地退缩
neurasthenically exhausted: 神经衰弱地筋疲力尽
neurasthenically irritable: 神经衰弱地易怒
neurasthenically depressed: 神经衰弱地抑郁
neurasthenically fatigued: 神经衰弱地疲惫不堪


词源:

The word "neurasthenically" is derived from "neurasthenia," which itself comes from the Greek roots:

* **νεῦρον (neuron):** nerve
* **ἀσθένεια (astheneia):** weakness

Therefore, "neurasthenia" literally means "nerve weakness," and "neurasthenically" describes something done or existing in a manner consistent with this condition.
