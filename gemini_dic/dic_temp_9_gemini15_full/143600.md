The word "outinfluences" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  However, we can analyze its potential meaning and structure based on its components.

It seems to be a combination of "out-" (meaning exceeding, surpassing, or exceeding in influence) and "influences" (the plural of "influence," meaning the capacity to have an effect on someone or something).


Therefore, a possible interpretation of "outinfluences" would be:

/ˌaʊtˈɪnflʊənsɪz/ | n. | 超越的影响，更大的影响 |  The combined effects exceeding the individual influences.  This is purely speculative, as it's not a recognized word.


To provide an example in the requested format, we must create a hypothetical usage:
