词源:  From Latin *obscēnus, meaning "ill-omened," "unlucky," "unfavorable," or "offensive."  The original meaning is related to the idea of something being morally wrong or inappropriate, which evolved into its modern meaning associated with sexual indecency.  The connection is subtle but likely rooted in the association of taboo sexual acts with bad luck or ill fortune in ancient cultures.
