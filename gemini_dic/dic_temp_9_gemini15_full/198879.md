词源:
The word "sidetrack" is a compound word, combining "side" and "track."  "Track" refers to a path or course, while "side" indicates a deviation from the main path.  It originated in the late 19th century, likely from the railway context, where a sidetrack is a secondary rail line branching off from the main line.  The figurative use, referring to diverting attention or progress, followed naturally.
