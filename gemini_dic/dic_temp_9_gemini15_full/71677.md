flatworms: /ˈflætˌwɜːrmz/ | n. |扁形动物；涡虫 | Flatworms are invertebrate animals belonging to the phylum Platyhelminthes. They are characterized by their flat, ribbon-like bodies and lack of a coelom (body cavity).  Many are free-living, inhabiting various aquatic environments, while others are parasitic, living within the bodies of other animals.  They possess a simple nervous system and often exhibit remarkable regenerative capabilities. | Example:  Many species of flatworms are found in freshwater lakes. = 许多种类的扁形动物都生活在淡水湖中。


The study of flatworms revealed interesting insights into their reproductive strategies. = 扁形动物的研究揭示了它们繁殖策略的有趣见解。


近义词: platyhelminthes (phylum name) | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, as it refers to a broad taxonomic group) | 词性: noun

词源:
The word "flatworm" is a compound word.  "Flat" describes their characteristic body shape, and "worm" is a general term for elongated, limbless invertebrates.  The scientific classification, Platyhelminthes, comes from the Greek words "platys" (flat) and "helmins" (worm).
