词源:
The word "shortcakes" is a compound word.  "Short" refers to the texture of the cake, which is tender and crumbly due to the use of shortening (fat) in the recipe.  "Cakes" simply indicates that it is a type of cake.  The term originated in the early 1800s in the United States, reflecting the popularity of this type of easily made, quick cake.
