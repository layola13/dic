词源:

The word "pithily" derives from the noun "pith," meaning the essential or most important part of something.  "Pith" itself has origins in Old English "pith," related to Old French "pith," meaning "marrow," referring to the soft central part of a plant stem.  The figurative meaning of "essential part" evolved from this physical description. The "-ily" suffix is an adverbial ending, indicating a manner or way of doing something.


用法说明:

"Pithily" is an adverb that describes how something is said or written. It emphasizes brevity and impact.  The statement or writing is not only short, but also forceful and memorable, conveying a significant meaning with few words.  It often suggests wit or incisiveness.  Avoid using "pithily" if the statement is merely short but lacks impact or clarity.
