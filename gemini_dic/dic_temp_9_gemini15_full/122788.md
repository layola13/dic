moldabilities: /ˌmoʊldəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可塑性，可成型性 | The ability of a material to be molded or shaped.  This refers to the ease with which a substance can be shaped or formed into a desired configuration using techniques like casting, pressing, or extrusion.  It often considers factors like the material's viscosity, elasticity, and temperature sensitivity. |

词源:

The word "moldabilities" is derived from the verb "to mold," meaning to shape or form something, and the suffix "-abilities," indicating the capacity or potential for something.  The root "mold" traces back to Old English *mōld, meaning "earth," "soil," or "dust," reflecting its early use in shaping objects from earth. The evolution to its modern sense relates to the process of shaping material.
