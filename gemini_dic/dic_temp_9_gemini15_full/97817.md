Etymology:

The word "inkhorn" literally refers to a container for ink made from the horn of an animal.  The use of "horn" in this context is related to the Old English word "horn," meaning a horn or a similar substance. The "ink" part is straightforward, deriving from the Old English "ince."  The figurative meaning of "inkhorn" developed later, associating the somewhat awkward and archaic forms of writing found in some scholarly works with the perceived clumsiness of the inkhorns themselves.  The association of inkhorn terms with pedantry and affected language arose in the 16th and 17th centuries, during a period of linguistic purism in which writers debated the appropriateness of borrowing foreign words and using archaic or learned vocabulary.
