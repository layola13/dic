deflagrability:/ˌdiːflæɡrəˈbɪləti/| n. |可燃性，易燃性 |The ability of a substance to undergo deflagration (rapid combustion).  It refers to how easily a material will ignite and burn rapidly, typically without an explosion.  The term is often used in the context of safety and hazard assessment. |Example: The deflagrability of the dust in the grain silo presented a significant fire hazard.  谷仓里的粉尘的可燃性构成了重大的火灾隐患。

The high deflagrability of methane makes it a dangerous gas in mining operations. 甲烷的高度可燃性使其成为矿井作业中的一种危险气体。|近义词：flammability, inflammability |反义词：non-flammability, incombustibility |名词


词源:

The word "deflagrability" is derived from the verb "deflagrate," which itself comes from the Latin prefix "de-" (down, off, away) and "flagro" (to burn, blaze).  Thus, "deflagrate" originally meant "to burn off" or "to burn away," implying a rapid and intense burning process.  The suffix "-ability" adds the sense of capacity or potential.


用法说明:

Deflagrability is primarily used in scientific and technical contexts, particularly in fields like chemistry, fire safety engineering, and materials science. It is a measure of a substance's propensity to undergo deflagration, a type of combustion characterized by rapid burning that propagates through a substance. Unlike detonation (an explosion), deflagration does not involve a supersonic shock wave.  The term is often used in safety regulations and risk assessments to describe the fire hazard presented by a particular material.


例句:

* The deflagrability of the fuel was tested under various conditions.  燃料的可燃性在各种条件下进行了测试。
*  The study assessed the deflagrability of different types of wood.  该研究评估了不同类型木材的可燃性。


需要注意的是，虽然deflagrability和flammability (易燃性)通常可以互换使用，但deflagrability更强调快速燃烧的过程，而flammability的范围更广，涵盖了各种燃烧方式。
