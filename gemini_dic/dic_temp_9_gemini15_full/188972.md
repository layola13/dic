The word "ryin" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a regional dialect word, or a newly coined word not yet widely recognized.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide the requested information, I need a correctly spelled word.
