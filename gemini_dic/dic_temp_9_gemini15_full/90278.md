词性：名词 (plural noun)


词源：The word "housekeeping" is a compound noun formed from "house" (meaning home or dwelling) and "keeping" (meaning maintaining or managing).  The suffix "-ing" transforms the verb "keep" into a gerund, functioning as a noun.  The plural "housekeepings" is less common and usually refers to a collection or variety of housekeeping tasks or duties, rather than a single instance of management.
