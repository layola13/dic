词源：

The word "emotion" comes from the Old French word "emocioun," which in turn derives from the Latin word "emotio," meaning "a moving, stirring."  The Latin word is formed from the verb "emovere," meaning "to move out, stir up, agitate."  This reflects the core idea of emotion as a powerful internal force that moves or stirs a person.
