词源:
The word "feverish" comes from the Old English word "fēferig," meaning "having a fever."  This word itself is derived from the Proto-Germanic "*febraz," which is related to the Latin "febris," meaning "fever."  The "-ish" suffix is a common English suffix indicating a slight degree or resemblance to the root word.  Therefore, "feverish" originally signified "having a slight fever," but its meaning has broadened to encompass other states of heightened excitement or agitation that resemble the symptoms of a fever.


用法说明:

1.  **Having a fever:** This is the original and literal meaning.  A feverish person has a high body temperature.

2.  **Excited and restless:** This is a more figurative use.  Someone described as "feverish" might be overly excited, agitated, or restless, often due to anticipation, anxiety, or passion.  The excitement is intense and often uncontrollable.

3.  **Rapid and intense activity:**  This usage relates to the energetic and uncontrolled nature of a fever.  For example, a "feverish pace of work" describes rapid and intense activity.
