词源:
The word "paraphernalia" ultimately derives from the Late Latin *paraphernalia, meaning "goods belonging to a wife."  This, in turn, comes from the Greek *paraferna, which literally translates to "beyond the dowry," referring to goods a wife brought to a marriage beyond her official dowry. The modern meaning evolved from this original sense of accompanying items or equipment associated with a particular person or activity.
