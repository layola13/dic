Etymology:  The word "discernment" comes from the Old French word *descernement*,  which in turn derives from the Latin verb *discernere*, meaning "to separate," "to distinguish," or "to perceive clearly."  The prefix "dis-" implies separation or distinction, while the root "-cernere" relates to sifting or separating.  The noun form developed over time to represent the act or capacity of making such distinctions.
