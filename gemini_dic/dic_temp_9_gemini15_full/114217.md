词源:

The word "maieutic" comes from the Greek word "μαῖευσις" (maieusis), meaning "midwifery" or "the act of delivering a baby".  Socrates, the ancient Greek philosopher, used a method of questioning to help his students "give birth" to their own understanding, hence the connection to midwifery and the term's application to his teaching method.  The term reflects the idea that knowledge is not simply imparted but rather drawn out from within the individual.
