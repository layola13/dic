词源:  The word "offtake" is a compound word.  "Off" indicates away from or separation from something, and "take" refers to the act of taking or removing.  Therefore, "offtake" literally means something taken away or removed from a main source.  Its usage in specialized fields like mining and petroleum engineering solidified its meaning.
