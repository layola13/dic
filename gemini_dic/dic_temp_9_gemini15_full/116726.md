USAGE->
This word is largely obsolete and doesn't lend itself to grammatical tense variations in the same way as modern verbs or adverbs.  Its usage is limited to expressing a concessive clause, similar to "despite" or "in spite of".  Therefore, standard tense examples are not applicable.  The following illustrates its function in a sentence:


Simple Present:  Mauger his best intentions, he caused offense. = 尽管他用心良苦，他还是冒犯了别人。

Simple Past: Mauger their warnings, they proceeded. = 尽管他们受到了警告，他们还是继续进行了。

Note:  More modern alternatives are preferred in contemporary writing.  The word's function is entirely concessive, not involving any action or state that would change with verb tense.


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "mauger".  Its archaic nature limits its usage to stand-alone adverbial phrases.
