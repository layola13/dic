词源:  The word "overpowering" comes from the verb "overpower," which is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much," "excessively," or "above") with the verb "power."  "Power" ultimately derives from the Old French "poer" and Latin "potere," meaning "to be able."  Therefore, "overpowering" literally means "having excessive power" or "possessing power to a degree that overwhelms."
