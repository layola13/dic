词源：
The word "nonregimented" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "regimented."  "Regimented" itself comes from "regiment," which has a long history:

* **Regiment (noun):**  Originally from the Old French "regiment," meaning "rule, government," ultimately derived from the Latin "regimen" (rule, government, regime).  This referred to the governing of a group of people.

* **Regiment (verb):**  The verb form developed later, meaning "to organize or control strictly."

Therefore, "nonregimented" directly signifies the absence of strict organization and control.
