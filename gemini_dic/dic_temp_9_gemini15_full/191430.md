词源:

The word "schiefer" is derived from the Middle High German word "schifer," which ultimately comes from the Proto-Germanic word "*skifaz." This word is related to the Old English word "scifi," meaning "shale" or "slate," and the modern English word "shale."  The word's evolution reflects the long-standing use of this type of rock across various Germanic languages.
