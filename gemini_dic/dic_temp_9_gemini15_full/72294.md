WORD ORIGIN->

The word "flounciest" is the superlative form of the adjective "flouncy," which itself derives from the verb "flounce."  "Flounce" ultimately comes from the Old French word "floncer," meaning "to move in a jerky or unsteady way," suggesting a flamboyant or dramatic movement. The addition of "-iest" creates the superlative, indicating the highest degree of flouncy-ness.
