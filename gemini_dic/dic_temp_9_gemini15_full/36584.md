词源:

Comes from the word "collateral," which originates from the Medieval Latin word "collateralis," meaning "situated side by side,"  derived from "con-" (together) + "lateralis" (of or pertaining to the side).  The sense evolved to describe something that is secondary or additional, and ultimately to assets used as security for a loan.
