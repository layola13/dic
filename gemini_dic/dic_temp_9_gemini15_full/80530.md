词源:
The word "goodies" is a plural form of "goodie," which is a shortened and informal version of "good things."  Its origin lies in the general use of "good" to describe something pleasant or desirable, evolving into the colloquial term "goodie" and then its plural "goodies" to refer to a collection of such items.
