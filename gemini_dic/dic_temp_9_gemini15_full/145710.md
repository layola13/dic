overcover: /ˈoʊvərkʌvər/ | adj. |过度掩盖的；秘密的；隐蔽的 |  The word "overcover" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a blend or a neologism (newly coined word), possibly combining "over" and "cover" to suggest excessive or secretive concealment.  It lacks a dictionary definition and established usage.  Therefore, providing examples of its usage in different grammatical tenses or phrases is impossible.  The intended meaning would depend entirely on context.  It might be used informally to describe something excessively hidden or a situation where there's more concealment than necessary.
