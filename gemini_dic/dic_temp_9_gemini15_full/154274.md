perispore:/ˈpɛrɪˌspɔːr/| n. |孢子外膜，外壁|A protective outer layer or covering of a spore, often composed of a resistant material.  It protects the spore from environmental stresses such as desiccation, radiation, and microbial attack.|Example: The perispore of this fungal spore is remarkably thick and resistant to decay.|近义词：exospore, spore coat|反义词：endospore (内生孢子)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The perispore protects the spore from harsh conditions. = 孢子外膜保护孢子免受恶劣环境的影响。
This fungus has a smooth perispore. =这种真菌的孢子外膜光滑。


一般过去时:
The researchers examined the perispore under a microscope. = 研究人员在显微镜下检查了孢子外膜。
The perispore degraded after several weeks. = 孢子外膜在几周后降解了。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered new information about perispore structures. = 科学家们已经发现了关于孢子外膜结构的新信息。
We have observed variations in perispore thickness in different species. = 我们观察到不同物种的孢子外膜厚度存在差异。


过去完成时:
Before germination, the perispore had remained intact. = 在萌发之前，孢子外膜一直保持完整。
The perispore had already begun to break down when the sample was collected. = 样本采集时，孢子外膜已经开始分解。


将来时:
We will analyze the perispore's chemical composition next. = 我们接下来将分析孢子外膜的化学成分。
The perispore will likely protect the spore during long-distance dispersal. = 在长距离传播过程中，孢子外膜可能会保护孢子。


虚拟语气:
If the perispore were damaged, the spore would be vulnerable. = 如果孢子外膜受损，孢子就会变得脆弱。
I wish I knew more about the perispore's role in spore survival. = 我希望我能更多地了解孢子外膜在孢子存活中的作用。


被动语态:
The perispore is often studied using electron microscopy. = 孢子外膜经常使用电子显微镜进行研究。
The chemical composition of the perispore was determined through various tests. = 孢子外膜的化学成分是通过各种测试确定的。


疑问句:
What is the function of the perispore? = 孢子外膜的功能是什么？
How does the perispore contribute to spore survival? = 孢子外膜如何促进孢子存活？


否定句:
The perispore does not always provide complete protection. = 孢子外膜并不总是提供完全的保护。
This species lacks a well-defined perispore. = 这个物种缺乏清晰的孢子外膜。


PHRASE->
perispore structure = 孢子外膜结构
perispore development = 孢子外膜发育
perispore morphology = 孢子外膜形态
