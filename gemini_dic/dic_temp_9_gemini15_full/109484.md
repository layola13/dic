词源:

The word "leprous" derives from the Middle English word "leprus," which in turn comes from the Old French "lepreux" and ultimately from the Latin "lepra," meaning "leprosy."  The term "leprosy" itself originates from the Greek "lepra,"  referring to a scaly skin disease.  Therefore, the word's etymology is directly linked to the disease leprosy.
