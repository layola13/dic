ETYMOLOGY->
The word "clapboarded" is derived from "clapboard," which itself has a complex etymology. "Clapboard" ultimately comes from the Middle English word "clapbord," a combination of "clap" (meaning "to strike" or "to overlap") and "bord" (meaning "board").  The "clap" refers to the way the boards are overlapped during installation, creating a protective layer.
