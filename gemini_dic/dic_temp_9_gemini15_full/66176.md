exchangeabilities:/ɪkˌtʃeɪnʒəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可交换性；可替代性 | The ability of things to be exchanged or substituted for one another.  This refers to the degree to which different items, units, or concepts can be interchanged without significantly altering the overall system or outcome.  It often implies a degree of equivalence or similar functionality. | Example: The high exchangeabilities of the various modules made system upgrades easy.  高模块的可交换性使系统升级变得容易。  | 近义词:interchangeability, substitutability, replaceability | 反义词:inflexibility, rigidity
