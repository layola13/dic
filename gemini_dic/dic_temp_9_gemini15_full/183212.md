词源:
The word "representational" comes from the verb "represent," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "repraesentare," meaning "to present again, to exhibit, to show."  The prefix "re-" means "again," and "praesentare" is related to "praesens," meaning "present."  Therefore, the original meaning involved presenting something anew or showing something clearly.  The "-ational" suffix transforms the verb into an adjective, signifying the quality or nature of representing.
