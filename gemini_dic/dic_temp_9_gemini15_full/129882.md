词源:

The word "non-interruptive" is a compound word formed from:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not."
* **interruptive**: An adjective meaning "causing interruption."  This in turn derives from:
    * **inter-**: A prefix meaning "between" or "among."
    * **rupt-**: A root relating to "breaking" or "bursting." (From Latin *rumpere*)
    * **-ive**: A suffix forming adjectives.


Therefore, "non-interruptive" literally means "not causing a breaking between" or "not interrupting."
