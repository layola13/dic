词源:
The word "sinecure" comes from the Latin phrase "sine cura," meaning "without care" or "without cure" (of souls).  Originally, it referred to a church office that involved no pastoral duties. Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass any position with minimal responsibilities but significant benefits.
