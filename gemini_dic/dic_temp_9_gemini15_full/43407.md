crankshafts:/ˈkræŋkʃæfts/ | n. |曲轴 | A crankshaft is a rotating mechanical part that transforms reciprocating motion (like that of a piston) into rotational motion (like that of a wheel). It's a crucial component in internal combustion engines, converting the linear movement of pistons into the rotating power used to drive vehicles or machinery.  | The car's engine failed due to a cracked crankshaft. 这辆车的发动机因曲轴破裂而失效。 The mechanic replaced the worn crankshaft in the old tractor. 机械师更换了旧拖拉机上磨损的曲轴。 |  camshaft, drive shaft |  (no direct antonym, as it describes a specific part) | 名词
