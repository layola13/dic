The word "probargaining" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  It's likely a newly coined word, a misspelling, or a word from a very specialized field.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and full grammatical description are impossible.  However, we can infer its possible meaning and structure.


It appears to be a combination of "pro" (in favor of, supporting) and "bargaining" (the process of negotiating the terms of a transaction).  Thus, it likely means "in favor of bargaining" or "supporting bargaining".


Let's create a hypothetical entry based on this assumption:
