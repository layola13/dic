词源：

The word "mantel" comes from the Old French word "mantel," meaning "cloak" or "mantle."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "mantellum," also meaning "cloak." The application to the shelf above a fireplace likely arose from its resemblance to the shape and position of a draped cloak.  The geological use is a later extension, referring to the Earth's layer as a kind of "cloak" surrounding the core.
