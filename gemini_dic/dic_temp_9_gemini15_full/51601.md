词源:  The word "devastating" comes from the verb "devastate," which itself originates from the Old French word "devasté," meaning "laid waste," "desolated," or "ruined."  The prefix "de-" means "completely," and the root "-vast-" relates to Old French "vast," meaning "empty" or "deserted."  The "-ate" suffix indicates a verb form. Thus, the original meaning pointed to a complete emptying or desolation.
