This term is often used in data compression, audio and image processing where the original data can be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed version. | Example:  Lossless compression algorithms are used to archive important documents to ensure no data is lost during storage.  无损压缩算法用于存档重要文档，以确保存储过程中不会丢失任何数据。

The MP3 file is lossy, but the WAV file is lossless. MP3文件是有损的，但WAV文件是无损的。|近义词：unaltered, undamaged, intact |反义词：lossy, damaged, corrupted

词源:
The word "lossless" is a compound word.  "Loss" comes from the Old English *los, meaning "destruction, death, damage,"  while "-less" is a suffix meaning "without."  Therefore, "lossless" literally means "without loss."
