词源:
The word "noodler" is likely a relatively recent coinage, a playful and descriptive term formed by adding the agentive suffix "-er" to the verb "noodle," which itself is a figurative extension of the noun "noodle," referring to something long, thin, and somewhat haphazard.  It likely emerged from the idea of someone's writing or drawing resembling a tangled mass of noodles.  There's no established etymological record tracing it to a specific earlier word.
