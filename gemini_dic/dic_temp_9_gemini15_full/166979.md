prestudiousnesses:/ˌpriːˈstʌdiəsnəsɪz/| n.|好学过度，过分用功|The word "prestudiousnesses" is extremely rare and not found in standard dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to "prestudious," which itself is uncommon. The word suggests excessive or ostentatious studiousness, implying a level of study beyond what is necessary or healthy.  There are no readily available examples of its usage in literature or common speech.  Because of its rarity, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage is impractical.|近义词:  overstudiousness, excessive diligence, pedantry|反义词:  laziness, indolence, negligence|名词
