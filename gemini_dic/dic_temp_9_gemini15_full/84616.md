The word "hanai" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a word from another language, possibly Hawaiian.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown in the requested format is impossible without knowing its origin and specific usage within that language.  If you can provide the language of origin, I can attempt a more accurate analysis.
