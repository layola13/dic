nonparallelisms:/ˌnɒnˈpærəˌlɛlɪzəm/| n.|非平行结构，不平行；不一致|The lack of parallelism in the sentence made it difficult to understand.  句子的非平行结构使其难以理解。|近义词：inconsistency, discrepancy|反义词：parallelism


This word describes a grammatical construction where elements intended to be parallel (similar in grammatical structure) are not.  It's a stylistic flaw that can make writing unclear and confusing.  For example, a list should maintain consistent grammatical structure.  Nonparallelism occurs when this consistency is broken.


例句：

The report highlighted the company's increased profits, its expansion into new markets, and they improved employee morale. (Nonparallel:  The first two elements are noun phrases, the third is a clause.)


The corrected version would be:  The report highlighted the company's increased profits, its expansion into new markets, and improved employee morale. (Parallel: All three elements are noun phrases.)


Another example:

She enjoys swimming, to hike, and cycling. (Nonparallel: Mix of gerund and infinitive.)


The corrected version would be: She enjoys swimming, hiking, and cycling. (Parallel: All gerunds.)



词源：

The word is formed from "non-" (not) + "parallelism" (the state of being parallel). Parallelism itself comes from the Greek "parallelos," meaning "beside one another."
