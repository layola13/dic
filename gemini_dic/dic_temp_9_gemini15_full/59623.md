ecclesia: /ɪˈkliːʒə/ | n. |教会；宗教团体；全体信徒 |

英文解析:The word "ecclesia" comes from the Greek word ἐκκλησία (ekklesia), meaning "assembly," "congregation," or "church." In ancient Greece, it referred to a public assembly or meeting of citizens.  In the New Testament, it was adopted to refer to the Christian community, the body of believers gathered together.  Therefore, it carries a more profound meaning than simply a building or organization; it signifies a community of faith bound together spiritually.

例句:

The early ecclesia faced persecution but persevered in its faith.  早期教会面临迫害，但仍坚持信仰。

This ecclesia is known for its charitable work within the community.  这个教会以其在社区中的慈善工作而闻名。
