词源:
diversifiability is derived from the verb "diversify,"  which comes from the Latin word "diversificare," meaning "to make different" or "to vary."  The suffix "-ability" indicates the capacity or potential for something.  Therefore, diversifiability signifies the capacity or potential to be diversified.
