词源:
The word "figure" originates from the Old French word "figure," meaning "shape, form, figure."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "figura," with the same meaning, ultimately derived from the verb "fingere," meaning "to fashion, shape, mold."  The evolution of the word shows its connection to the visual and conceptual aspects of shape and form, which are reflected in its various modern meanings.
