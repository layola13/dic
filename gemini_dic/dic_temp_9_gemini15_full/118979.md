It is brownish in color and unable to transport oxygen effectively.  This condition can be caused by various factors, including certain drugs, toxins, and genetic disorders. | The patient's methaemoglobin level was elevated, indicating potential toxicity.  病人高铁血红蛋白水平升高，提示可能中毒。|  hemoglobin | oxyhemoglobin |
