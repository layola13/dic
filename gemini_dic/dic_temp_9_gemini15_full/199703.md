The term specifically refers to certain mollusks, primarily bivalves and gastropods, that have this specialized gill arrangement. |例句：Many marine bivalves, such as clams and mussels, are siphonobranchiate. 许多海洋双壳类动物，如蛤和贻贝，都是具虹吸管鳃的。
例句：The siphonobranchiate anatomy allows these organisms to filter feed effectively.  具虹吸管鳃的解剖结构使这些生物能够有效地滤食。|近义词：siphonate (referring to the siphon itself)|反义词：ctenobranchiate (comb-like gills),  aspidobranchiate (shield-like gills)|词性：形容词
