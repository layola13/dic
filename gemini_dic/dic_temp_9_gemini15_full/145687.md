词源:

The word "overcorrect" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "correct" (meaning "to make right or accurate").  The verb "correct" itself originates from the Old French word "correcte," derived from the Latin word "corrigere," meaning "to straighten, to set right."
