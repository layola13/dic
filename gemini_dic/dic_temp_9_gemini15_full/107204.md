词源:

The term "lah-di-dah" is onomatopoeic, meaning it imitates a sound.  It's believed to mimic the affected, high-pitched tones of speech associated with upper-class affectation. The exact origin is unclear, but its usage became popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, reflecting a growing social commentary on the perceived pretentiousness of the upper classes.  The term likely emerged from informal speech and gradually made its way into more formal contexts.  Its usage often carries a humorous or satirical tone.
