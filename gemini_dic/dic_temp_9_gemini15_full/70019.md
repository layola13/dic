词源:
The word "fetish" comes from the Portuguese word "feitiço," meaning "charm" or "amulet."  It entered English in the 18th century through the writings of anthropologists studying religious practices in Africa and other parts of the world. Initially, it referred to objects believed to possess magical or spiritual power.  Over time, its meaning evolved to encompass the more modern psychological understanding of fetishism.
