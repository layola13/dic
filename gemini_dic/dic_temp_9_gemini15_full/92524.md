hypotrochoid:/ˈhaɪpəʊtroʊkɔɪd/ | n. |次摆线|A hypotrochoid is a roulette traced by a point attached to a circle of radius r rolling around the inside of a fixed circle of radius R, where the point is a distance d from the center of the interior circle.  When d = r, the hypotrochoid is a hypocycloid. When d > r, the curve self-intersects.  It's a generalization of a hypocycloid. |The intricate patterns created by hypotrochoids are often found in decorative arts and mathematical illustrations.  The design of certain gears can also be based on hypotrochoid principles.|近义词：hypocycloid (when d=r) |反义词：epitrochoid (exterior rolling)|名词
