nonclassicality: /ˌnɒnˈklæsɪkælɪti/ | n. |非经典性；非经典特征|The quality or state of being nonclassical; deviation from classical norms or principles.  It often refers to phenomena that cannot be explained by classical physics. For example, in quantum mechanics, nonclassicality refers to features of quantum systems that cannot be described by classical mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement.| Example: The experiment demonstrated the nonclassicality of the light source.  该实验证明了光源的非经典性。 The strong nonclassicality of the photon source is crucial to the experiment's success. 光子源的强非经典性对实验的成功至关重要。|近义词:unconventionality, unconventionality, non-classicism|反义词:classicism, conventionality
