USAGE->
This word is so rare that providing example sentences for various tenses is impractical and unnatural.  The word itself is a complex noun and would be used in a descriptive way rather than as a verb or participating in typical tense changes.  The focus would be on its use within a sentence to describe a state or quality.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "hypersensuousnesses."  The word itself is too uncommon for established phrasal use.
