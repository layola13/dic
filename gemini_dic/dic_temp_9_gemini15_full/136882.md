USAGE->
This word is a plural noun and doesn't conjugate like verbs.  Therefore, grammatical tenses like present, past, future, etc., don't apply.  The word itself describes a state of being,  not an action.

例句1:  His repeated nonsobernesses cost him his job. 他的反复醉酒让他丢了工作。
例句2: The police reported a rise in nonsobernesses during the holiday season.  警方报告称节日期间醉酒事件有所增加。


PHRASE->
This word is not typically used in common phrases.  It's a relatively uncommon and formal word.  Phrases would be built *around* the word, rather than with the word as a core component.  For example:


Phrase 1: a series of nonsobernesses 一系列醉酒行为
Phrase 2:  instances of nonsobernesses  醉酒行为的例子
Phrase 3: evidence of nonsobernesses 醉酒行为的证据
Phrase 4:  public displays of nonsobernesses 公开的醉酒行为
Phrase 5:  the consequences of nonsobernesses 醉酒行为的后果


词源:

The word is formed from "non-" (meaning "not") + "sober" (meaning "not drunk or intoxicated") + "-ness" (a suffix forming nouns of state or condition) + "-es" (plural ending).  Therefore, it literally means "states of not being sober" or "instances of not being sober".
