词源:
The word is formed by combining:

* **non-**: a prefix meaning "not"
* **enforced**: the past participle of the verb "enforce," meaning to compel observance of a rule or law.
* **-ly**: an adverbial suffix.

Therefore, "nonenforcedly" means "not in a manner of enforcement" or "not compulsorily."
