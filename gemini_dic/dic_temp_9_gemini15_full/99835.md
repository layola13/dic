intermitotic: /ˌɪntərmaɪˈtɑːtɪk/ | adj. | 间期的；细胞间期的 | Relating to the period between two successive cell divisions.  The term describes the stage in the cell cycle where the cell is not actively dividing. During interphase, the cell grows, replicates its DNA, and prepares for mitosis. | Example:  The cell undergoes significant metabolic activity during the intermitotic phase.  间期细胞经历了大量的代谢活动。

The cell showed typical intermitotic characteristics before entering mitosis. 该细胞在进入有丝分裂之前表现出典型的间期特征。


近义词：interphasic (more commonly used in this context)


反义词：mitotic (referring to the process of cell division itself)


词性：形容词

疑问句:
Is the cell currently in the intermitotic phase? = 细胞目前是否处于间期？
What are the key events that occur during the intermitotic period? = 间期发生的重大事件是什么？


否定句:
The cell was not in the intermitotic phase; it was undergoing mitosis. = 细胞并不处于间期；它正在进行有丝分裂。
The results did not support the hypothesis that the protein was active during the intermitotic stage. = 结果不支持该蛋白质在间期活跃的假设。
