nonhectically: /ˌnɒnˈhɛktɪkli/ | adv. | 不慌不忙地；平静地 |  This word is not found in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a newly coined word or a misspelling.  It appears to be formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to a word resembling "hectically" (which itself is not a standard English word, but suggests a connection to "hectic").  The intended meaning is the opposite of frantic or hurried activity.  Therefore, it implies a calm and unhurried manner. | 例句：She approached the problem nonhectically, considering all options before acting. 她不慌不忙地处理这个问题，在采取行动之前考虑了所有选择。  He completed the marathon nonhectically, enjoying the scenery along the way. 他不慌不忙地完成了马拉松比赛，一路欣赏风景。 | 近义词：calmly, serenely, peacefully, leisurely, composedly | 反义词：frantically, hectically, hurriedly, rapidly, wildly |  词性: 副词
