词源:

The word "pacemaker" is a compound word.  "Pace" comes from the Old French "pas," meaning "step" or "pace," ultimately deriving from the Latin "passus," meaning "step" or "stride."  The suffix "-maker" indicates something that makes or creates paces, or sets the pace.  Therefore, the word literally means "step-setter" or "pace-setter."  The application to medical devices is a relatively modern use, reflecting its function in setting the rhythm of the heart.
