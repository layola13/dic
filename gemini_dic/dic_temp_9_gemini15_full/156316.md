词源:  The word "physicalist" is derived from "physicalism," which combines "physical" (relating to the physical world) and the suffix "-ism" (denoting a doctrine or system of beliefs).  The term emerged in the 20th century with the rise of analytic philosophy and the increasing influence of science on philosophical thought.
