Etymology:  The word "sham" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "schamen," meaning "to be ashamed" or "to feel shame." This evolved through various stages of meaning, associating the feeling of shame with something false or dishonest, eventually leading to its current meaning of a deceptive act or thing.  The connection lies in the shame associated with being exposed as a deceiver.
