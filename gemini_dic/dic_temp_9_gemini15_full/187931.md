词源:

The word "ratchet" ultimately derives from the Old French word "rochet," meaning "a catch, a pawl."  This term likely evolved from an earlier Germanic root. The specific evolution of the word is complex and involves several intermediate forms in different languages. The modern English spelling and pronunciation reflect the evolution through French and possibly other Romance influences.
