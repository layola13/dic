词源:  The word "idolize" comes from the noun "idol," ultimately derived from the Greek word "eidolon," meaning "image" or "likeness."  The suffix "-ize" is a verb-forming suffix indicating "to make or become." Therefore, "idolize" literally means "to make into an idol" or "to treat as an idol."  The word has evolved to encompass not just literal idols but also any object or person that receives excessive reverence.
