词源:
The term "make-believe" is a compound word.  "Make" is from Old English *macian, meaning "to do" or "to make," and "believe" comes from Old English *gɪlēafan, meaning "to believe" or "to trust." The combination suggests the act of creating something and accepting it as real, even if it's not.  The usage evolved over time from simply believing something that isn't true to the active process of pretending or creating an illusion.
