词源：

From Middle English *convocatif, from Old French convocatif, from convoquer "to summon," from Vulgar Latin *convocare, from Latin con- "together" + vocare "to call."


用法说明：

Convocative is primarily used to describe something that brings to mind a particular feeling, memory, or image.  It suggests a strong sense of evocation or summoning.  It is often used in the context of art, music, or literature, but can also be used to describe other things that have a similar effect.  While similar to "evocative," "convocative" might carry a slightly stronger sense of a direct call or summoning to action or memory.
