/ˌoʊvərˈnuːtrəlaɪzər/ | n. | 过度中和剂 | A substance that neutralizes something to an excessive degree, often resulting in an undesirable effect.  It's typically used in contexts where precise neutralization is crucial, and an overcorrection leads to problems. For example, in chemistry, adding too much base to an acid solution could create an overneutralized solution with a different undesirable pH. |The overneutralizer caused the solution to become too alkaline. = 过度中和剂导致溶液碱性过强。  The excessive use of overneutralizers in the soil led to nutrient imbalances. = 土壤中过度使用过度中和剂导致养分失衡。|近义词: counteragent (in some contexts), excess neutralizing agent |反义词: insufficient neutralizer


USAGE->
This word is primarily used as a noun and doesn't have typical verb conjugations like "hello".  The usage depends entirely on the context of neutralization in a specific field, such as chemistry, environmental science, or medicine.  Therefore, providing example sentences across various tenses would be artificial and misleading.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "overneutralizer".  The term itself is quite niche and technical.
