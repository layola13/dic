hypermetamorphosis:/ˌhaɪpərˌmɛtəˈmɔrfəsɪs/| n. |超变态|The phenomenon in which an insect undergoes more than four larval stages, each with a distinct form and function, often exhibiting dramatic changes in behavior and morphology.  This is unlike the typical complete metamorphosis (e.g., butterfly) where there are only four stages (egg, larva, pupa, adult).  Hypermetamorphosis is seen in certain families of beetles, particularly those that are parasitic.  | Example:  The life cycle of the blister beetle exhibits hypermetamorphosis, with the larvae undergoing several distinct stages, each adapted to a different ecological niche.  超吹泡甲虫的生命周期表现出超变态，幼虫经历了几个不同的阶段，每个阶段都适应不同的生态位。|近义词:polymorphism(in the context of insect development), complex metamorphosis |反义词:simple metamorphosis, incomplete metamorphosis |名词
