词源:
The word "sealift" is a compound word formed from "sea" and "lift."  "Sea" refers to the ocean, and "lift" in this context means to transport or convey.  Therefore, "sealift" literally means "transporting by sea."  It emerged in the mid-20th century, particularly gaining prominence during wartime logistical planning.
