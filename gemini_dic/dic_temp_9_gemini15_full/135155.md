/ˌnɒnˈɒnərəsnəsɪz/ | n. |非繁重性；非劳累性 | The word "nononerousnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a nonce word, likely formed by adding "-nesses" (a pluralizing suffix indicating qualities or states) to "nononerous" (itself an unusual combination of "non-" and "onerous").  "Onerous" means burdensome, troublesome, or oppressive. Therefore, "nononerous" would mean not burdensome, not troublesome, or not oppressive.  "Nononerousnesses" attempts to express multiple instances or aspects of this lack of burden. However, its awkwardness makes it unsuitable for formal writing. A more natural way to express the concept would be to use phrases like "lack of burdens," "easy tasks," or "absence of difficulties." |  There are no standard examples as this is not a real word.  |近义词:  ease,  lightness, simplicity |反义词: burdens, difficulties, hardships
