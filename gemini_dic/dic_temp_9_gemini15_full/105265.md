The word "kheyti" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a word from another language, or a neologism (newly coined word).  To provide the requested information, I need a correct English word or clarification on the word's origin.
