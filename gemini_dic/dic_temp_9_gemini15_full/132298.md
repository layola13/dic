The word "nondefiances" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism, possibly a misspelling or a newly coined word formed by adding the prefix "non-" to a root that might be intended to be related to "defiance."  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a meaningful response, one would need to understand the intended meaning and context in which this word was used.
