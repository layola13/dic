词源:

The word "cousin-hoods" is a relatively modern coinage. It combines "cousin," derived from the Old French *cosin (from Latin *consobrinus), denoting a cousin, with the suffix "-hood," an Old English suffix meaning "state, condition, quality, or kind."  Therefore, "cousin-hoods" signifies multiple instances of the state or condition of being cousins.
