词源:
From Middle English *clew, from Old English *cleowe, from Proto-Germanic *klau̯ō, from Proto-Indo-European *(g)lewh₂- (“to wind, coil”).  The modern spelling reflects a later influence of the word "clue", which has a similar meaning.  The original sense was of a ball of yarn, and the metaphorical sense of "clue" developed later.
