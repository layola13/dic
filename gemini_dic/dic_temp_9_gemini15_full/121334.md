词源:  The word "misgendered" is a relatively recent addition to the English language, arising from the increasing awareness and understanding of gender identity. It combines the prefix "mis-" (meaning wrongly or incorrectly) with the noun "gendered" (referring to the assignment or perception of someone's gender).  The term reflects the growing need to accurately and respectfully acknowledge individuals' self-identified genders.
