词源:  The word "harum-scarum" is of uncertain origin.  The first element, "harum," is likely a variant of "harum-scarum,"  itself possibly derived from a Middle English word meaning "wild" or "reckless." The "scarum" part is equally obscure, with potential connections to words suggesting "scattered" or "disordered."  The overall sense developed as a descriptive term for something or someone wildly energetic and chaotic.
