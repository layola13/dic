词源:  Derived from "raffish," meaning "disreputable," "disorderly," or "shabby," ultimately from a now-obsolete word meaning "rag," suggesting a connection to a somewhat disheveled or unconventional appearance.  The word's evolution reflects a shift in connotation, from purely negative to one that can also suggest a certain appealing nonconformity.
