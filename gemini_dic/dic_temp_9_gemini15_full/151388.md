词源:

From Parliament +‎ -ary.  "Parliament" itself originates from the Old French *parlement, meaning "a speaking," "a discussion," or "a talk."  Ultimately, it's derived from the verb parler, "to speak."  The "-ary" suffix is a common adjectival suffix in English, indicating "relating to" or "characteristic of."
