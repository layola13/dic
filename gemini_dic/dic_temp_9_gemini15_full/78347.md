The word "gesse" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling: Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a very rare or obsolete word:  If you encountered it in a specific context (book, article, etc.), please provide that context.
* It's a word from a dialect or specialized field:  If it's from a specific region or technical area, let me know.
* It's a proper noun: If it is a name or place name, providing more information would be helpful.


Please provide more information so I can assist you effectively.
