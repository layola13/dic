karpholite: /ˈkɑːrpəlaɪt/ | n. |绿帘石| A hydrous manganese aluminum silicate mineral.  It is usually found in metamorphic rocks, often associated with other manganese minerals. Its color ranges from pale green to dark green, and it has a vitreous to pearly luster.  | Example:  The geologist identified the sample as karpholite due to its characteristic green color and association with manganese oxides.  绿岩学家根据其特征的绿色和与锰氧化物的关联，将样品鉴定为绿帘石。| 近义词:  (mineralogical context)  other manganese-bearing silicates | 反义词:  (No direct antonyms, as it's a specific mineral) | 名词


USAGE->
