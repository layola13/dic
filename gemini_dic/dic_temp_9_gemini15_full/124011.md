Etymology:

The word "moron" originates from the early 20th century. It was coined by psychologist Henry Herbert Goddard, who adapted it from the Ancient Greek word  μωρός (mōrós), meaning "foolish" or "silly". Goddard used it to categorize individuals with mild intellectual disability within a broader system of intellectual classification.  The term fell out of favor in clinical psychology due to its offensive nature.
