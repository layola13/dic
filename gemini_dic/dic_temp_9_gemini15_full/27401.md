近义词：guest starring, appearing briefly, playing a cameo role | 反义词：starring (in the main role)


词源:源于cameo (n.)，意为“宝石浮雕”，后来引申为“客串演出”，因为客串演员就像浮雕一样，只是短暂出现，却给人留下深刻印象。  The word ultimately derives from the Italian word "cameo," which refers to a gem carved in relief. The association with brief but significant appearances in films and plays developed later.
