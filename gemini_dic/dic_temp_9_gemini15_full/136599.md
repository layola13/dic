/ˌnɒnˈseɪnəsɪz/ | n. |胡说八道；荒谬行为的复数 | The nonsanenesses uttered by the speaker were met with bewildered silence.  |近义词：absurdities, inanities, follies |反义词：senses, rationality


英文解析:The word "nonsanenesses" is not a standard English word. It's a nonce word, formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to "nonsane," which itself is not a common word.  "Nonsane" would imply "not sane," or "insane."  Therefore, "nonsanenesses" attempts to create a plural noun referring to multiple instances or types of insanity or nonsensical behavior.  Its use is highly unconventional and should be avoided in formal writing.


例句:

The nonsanenesses of the situation were becoming increasingly clear.  = 情况的荒谬之处越来越明显了。

His actions, a series of nonsanenesses, baffled everyone. = 他的行为，一系列荒谬的行为，让每个人都困惑不解。


因为“nonsanenesses”并非标准英语词汇，所以无法提供关于其在不同时态、语态、语气下的例句，以及常见的词组搭配。  它只在非常非正式和创造性的语境下才会出现，通常是为了强调某种极度的非理性或荒谬。
