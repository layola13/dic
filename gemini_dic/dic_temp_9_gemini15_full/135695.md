It encompasses various scenarios where something that might be expected to be presented is absent. This could range from neglecting to show crucial data points in a report to avoiding a topic altogether during a discussion.  The concept highlights the significance of what is *not* shared, as it can be just as revealing as what is presented. | Example:  The nonpresentations in the company's financial report raised concerns among investors. = 公司财务报表中未披露的内容引发了投资者担忧。The professor's nonpresentations of counterarguments weakened his lecture. = 教授没有提出反驳意见，削弱了他的讲座。|近义词: omissions, absences, suppressions |反义词: presentations, disclosures, revelations |
