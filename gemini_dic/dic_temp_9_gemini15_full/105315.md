词源:  The word "kibitz" is of Yiddish origin, derived from the word "kibitzer," meaning "one who looks on and offers unsolicited advice or comments."  The Yiddish word itself likely has roots in German or possibly Slavic languages, but the exact etymology is debated.  The act of kibitzing, therefore, is an extension of the noun meaning the person who does it.
