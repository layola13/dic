词源:
The word "clerklike" is derived from "clerk" + "-like," meaning "resembling a clerk."  "Clerk" itself has origins in the Old English word "clerc," meaning a "scholar" or "clergyman," reflecting the historical association of clerks with literacy and record-keeping.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the more modern sense of an office worker or employee.
