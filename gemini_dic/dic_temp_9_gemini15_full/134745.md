nonmedullated:/ˌnɒnˈmɛdjʊleɪtɪd/| adj. |无髓的；无髓鞘的|Not having a myelin sheath.  This term is primarily used in biology and neuroscience to describe nerve fibers or axons that lack the myelin sheath, a fatty insulating layer that surrounds some nerve fibers and increases the speed of nerve impulse transmission.  |Example:  Nonmedullated nerve fibers conduct impulses more slowly than medullated ones.  无髓神经纤维比有髓神经纤维传导冲动慢。|近义词：unmyelinated|反义词：medullated, myelinated
