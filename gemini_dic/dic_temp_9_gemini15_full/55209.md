词源:
The word "disserve" is a combination of the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the verb "serve."  It evolved from the Old French word "servir" and ultimately from the Latin "servire," meaning "to serve."  The addition of "dis-" creates the antonymic meaning of failing to serve adequately or properly.
