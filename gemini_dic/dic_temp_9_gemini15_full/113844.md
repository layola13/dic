The word "madefication" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (a newly coined word) or a misspelling. There's no established pronunciation, grammatical function, meaning, or usage.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need a correct or intended word.
