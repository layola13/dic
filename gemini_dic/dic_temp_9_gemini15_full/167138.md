presympathizes:  /ˌpriːˈsɪmpəθaɪzɪz/ | v. | 预先同情；提前表示同情 |  This word is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, a newly coined word, formed by combining "pre-" (before) and "sympathizes" (feels or expresses sympathy).  It implies feeling sympathy before the event or situation requiring it, which could be interpreted as anticipating someone's suffering or misfortune.  Because it's not a standard word, there are no established dictionary definitions, synonyms, or antonyms. Its usage is highly context-dependent and could be considered informal or even awkward.


例句:

She presympathizes with the refugees before they even arrive, knowing the hardships they face. = 她甚至在难民到达之前就预先对他们表示同情，知道他们将面临的苦难。


He presympathizes with the team, knowing their opponent's strong record. = 他预先对球队表示同情，因为他知道对手的战绩很强。
