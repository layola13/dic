词源:
The word "hooray" itself is of uncertain origin, possibly an alteration of "hurrah," which may derive from a combination of Old Norse words or from a similar exclamation in other Germanic languages.  The "-ing" suffix transforms it into a present participle, indicating the action of shouting "hooray."
