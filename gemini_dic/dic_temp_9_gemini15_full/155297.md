词源：

The word "phantasmagorian" derives from "phantasmagoria," a term coined in the late 18th century.  "Phantasmagoria" itself is a combination of the Greek words:

* **phantasm (φάντασμα):** meaning "phantom," "apparition," or "specter."
* **agoria (ἀγορά):** meaning "gathering" or "assembly."

Therefore, "phantasmagoria" literally translates to "a gathering of phantoms" or "a display of apparitions."  The term originally referred to a type of popular 19th-century entertainment involving projected images that appeared and disappeared, creating a spooky and illusionary effect.  The adjective "phantasmagorian" then emerged to describe things that resembled this spectacle – bizarre, dreamlike, and fantastic.
