convection:/kənˈvɛkʃən/| n. |对流，传送|The movement of heat through a fluid (liquid or gas) caused by differences in density.  Heat rises in less dense areas and sinks in more dense areas, creating a cycle of movement.  This process is responsible for many weather phenomena, such as thunderstorms and wind.|例句：Convection currents in the Earth's mantle are responsible for plate tectonics. 地球地幔的对流电流是板块构造的原因。|例句：The heating system relies on convection to distribute warm air throughout the house.  供暖系统依靠对流将暖空气分布到整个房子。|近义词：circulation, transfer, transmission|反义词：conduction, radiation|名词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Convection is a key process in atmospheric science. = 对流是大气科学中的一个关键过程。
Heat transfer often occurs through convection. = 热传递通常通过对流发生。


一般过去时:
Convection currents moved the hot air upwards. = 对流气流将热空气向上移动。
The experiment demonstrated convection clearly. = 实验清楚地证明了对流。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied convection for centuries. = 科学家们已经研究对流几个世纪了。
We have observed significant convection patterns. = 我们已经观察到显著的对流模式。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, we had predicted the convection patterns. = 在实验之前，我们已经预测了对流模式。
The scientists had already understood the basic principles of convection. = 科学家们已经了解了对流的基本原理。


将来时:
We will study convection in more detail next week. = 我们下周将更详细地研究对流。
The research will explore new aspects of convection. = 这项研究将探索对流的新方面。


虚拟语气:
If there were no convection, the weather would be very different. = 如果没有对流，天气将会大不一样。
I wish I had understood convection better earlier. = 我希望我早点能更好地理解对流。


被动语态:
Convection is often used to explain weather patterns. = 对流常被用来解释天气模式。
The air was heated by convection. = 空气通过对流被加热。


疑问句:
Is convection the primary method of heat transfer in this system? = 在这个系统中，对流是主要的热传递方法吗？
How does convection affect the climate? = 对流如何影响气候？


否定句:
Convection does not always occur in a uniform manner. = 对流并不总是以均匀的方式发生。
The experiment did not show significant convection. = 实验没有显示出明显的对流。


PHRASE->
forced convection = 强制对流
free convection = 自然对流
convection current = 对流电流
convection oven = 对流烤箱
atmospheric convection = 大气对流
