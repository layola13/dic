remesh:/riːˈmɛʃ/ | vt. |重新网格化，重新划分网格|To create a new mesh for (a 3D model) by replacing the existing mesh with a new one, often with different resolution or topology.  This process is commonly used in 3D modeling and computer graphics to improve the quality of a model, refine its details, or reduce its polygon count.| 例句：The artist remeshed the character model to improve its low-poly appearance.  艺术家重新网格化了角色模型以改善其低多边形外观。

The engineer remeshed the terrain data to create a smoother surface. 工程师重新网格化了地形数据以创建更平滑的表面。|近义词：remodel, refashion, rebuild (in the context of 3D modeling)|反义词：None (the opposite would be to leave the mesh unchanged)|动词
