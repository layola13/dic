词源：

The word "mirthless" is a combination of "mirth" and the suffix "-less."  "Mirth" comes from Old English *myrgþ, meaning "joy, gladness, merriment." The suffix "-less" indicates the absence or lack of something. Therefore, "mirthless" literally means "without mirth" or "lacking joy."


用法说明:

"Mirthless" is primarily used as an adjective to describe something, typically an atmosphere, event, or person, that lacks joy, merriment, or amusement. It suggests a feeling of sadness, gloom, or seriousness.  It can also describe a sound, such as laughter, that lacks genuine happiness.  The word carries a more negative connotation than simply "not merry."  It implies a palpable absence of joy, often suggesting something is wrong or unsettling.
