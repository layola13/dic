praesternum: /ˌpreɪˈstɜːrnəm/ | n. |前胸骨|

英文解析：The praesternum is the anterior segment of the sternum, the breastbone.  It's the uppermost part of the sternum,  located above the mesosternum and xiphisternum.  It's a significant anatomical structure involved in the formation of the rib cage and protection of vital organs.

例句：

The praesternum articulates with the clavicles and first ribs. = 前胸骨与锁骨和第一肋骨相连。

Fractures of the praesternum are relatively rare. = 前胸骨骨折相对罕见。


词源：

From Latin *prae- ("before") + sternum ("breastbone").  It literally means "before the sternum," referring to its position.


近义词：manubrium sterni (this is a more formal and complete anatomical term)


反义词：无直接反义词，但可以考虑xiphisternum (剑突)作为相对位置上的反义。
