词源:
The term "dooring" is a relatively recent addition to the lexicon, arising from the combination of "door" and the act of opening it (i.e.,  "doing" something with a door). Its increasing usage reflects the growing awareness and concern about this specific type of traffic accident.  There isn't a specific historical etymology like many older words.
