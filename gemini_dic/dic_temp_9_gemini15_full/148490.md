词源:
The word "overstrike" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "above," "beyond," or "again") and the verb "strike" (meaning to hit or impact).  In the context of typing, it refers to striking a key again on top of a previously typed character.  The meaning of dominating or suppressing is a figurative extension of the literal meaning.
