词源：

The word "interceptors" derives from the verb "intercept," which itself comes from the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and the verb "cept" (from the Latin "capere," meaning "to take" or "to seize").  Therefore, "intercept" literally means "to seize or take something between" or "to catch something in its path".  The suffix "-or" is added to create the noun form, designating a person or thing that performs the action of intercepting.
