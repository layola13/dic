词源:

The word "coveralls" is a combination of "cover" and "alls," implying that it covers all (or most) of the body.  The "-alls" suffix is common in garment names (overalls, overalls).  The word's origins date back to the late 19th or early 20th century, when the need for protective work clothing became more prevalent.
