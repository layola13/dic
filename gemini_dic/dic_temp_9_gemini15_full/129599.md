词源:

The word "non-complacent" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "complacent."  "Complacent" comes from the Late Latin word "complacēns," meaning "pleasing," which is derived from the prefix "com-" (meaning "together" or "with") and "placēre" (meaning "to please" or "to soothe").  Therefore, "complacent" originally meant feeling pleased with oneself, which evolved to the modern meaning of self-satisfied to the point of being unaware of potential dangers or deficiencies.  Adding "non-" creates the antonym, signifying the opposite of being self-satisfied.
