词源:

The word "nonaccrual" is a compound word. It combines the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the word "accrual," which comes from the verb "accrue."  "Accrue" ultimately originates from the Old French word "accrue," meaning "to increase," which itself derives from the Latin word "accrescere," meaning "to grow to."  Therefore, "nonaccrual" literally means "not increasing" or "not accumulating," specifically referring to interest or other financial gains.
