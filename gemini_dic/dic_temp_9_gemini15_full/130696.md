nonagglomerative: /ˌnɒnəˈɡlɒmərətɪv/ | adj. | 非凝聚的，非聚集的 | Not tending to agglomerate; not forming a mass or cluster.  This term is primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly in fields like computer science (specifically cluster analysis) and materials science. It describes processes or structures that do not combine or clump together. | Example:  The nonagglomerative clustering algorithm produced distinct, well-separated groups.  这个非凝聚聚类算法产生了明显分离的组群。| 近义词:  dispersed, separate, unclustered | 反义词: agglomerative, clustered, aggregated


USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective, so it doesn't have verb conjugations like "What" in the example.  Its usage is descriptive.

Example sentences illustrating its use:

A nonagglomerative manufacturing process results in individual components rather than a fused mass.  非凝聚的制造工艺产生的是单个组件，而不是熔合的整体。

The nonagglomerative nature of the powder ensured even distribution in the mixture.  粉末的非凝聚特性确保了混合物均匀分布。

The researcher observed a nonagglomerative distribution of nanoparticles in the solution. 研究人员观察到溶液中纳米颗粒的非聚集分布。

The image analysis software identified the nonagglomerative regions in the sample. 图像分析软件识别了样品中的非凝聚区域。
