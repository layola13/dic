词源:  The word is formed by combining the prefix "mis-" (meaning wrongly or badly) with "channelling" (the act of directing something along a particular course).  "Channelling" itself originates from the Old French word "chanel," meaning "a groove or channel," ultimately derived from Latin "canalis."
