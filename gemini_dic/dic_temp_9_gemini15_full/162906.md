词源:  From Middle English *preceptrice, from Old French preceptrice, from Latin praeceptrix, feminine of praeceptor ("teacher, instructor"), from praeceptus, past participle of praecipere ("to teach, instruct, order, command"), from prae- ("before") + capere ("to take, seize").  Essentially, the word traces back to the idea of "one who takes before," or "one who teaches beforehand."
