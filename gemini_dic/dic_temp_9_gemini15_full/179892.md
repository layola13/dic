refraction:/rɪˈfrækʃən/| n. |折射，屈光|The bending of a wave as it passes from one medium to another.  This change in direction is caused by a change in the speed of the wave.  Examples include the bending of light as it enters water, or sound waves bending around corners.|Example: The refraction of light through a prism creates a rainbow.|近义词：bending, deflection|反义词：reflection (in the context of wave behavior)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Light refraction occurs when light passes through different mediums. = 光线在穿过不同介质时发生折射。
The prism demonstrates the refraction of light. = 棱镜演示了光的折射。

一般过去时:

The experiment successfully showed light refraction. = 实验成功地展示了光的折射。

现在完成时:
We have studied the principles of light refraction in class. = 我们在课堂上学习了光的折射原理。
Scientists have observed many examples of refraction in nature. = 科学家们已经观察到自然界中许多折射的例子。

过去完成时:
Before the discovery, they had not understood light refraction properly. = 在发现之前，他们没有正确理解光的折射。
The physicist had already explained the refraction phenomenon. = 物理学家已经解释了折射现象。

将来时:
We will analyze the refraction of sound waves in the next experiment. = 我们将在下一次实验中分析声波的折射。
The researchers will use a new method to measure refraction. = 研究人员将使用一种新的方法来测量折射。

虚拟语气:
If the medium were denser, the refraction would be greater. = 如果介质更致密，折射会更大。

被动语态:
Refraction is explained by Snell's Law. = 斯涅耳定律解释了折射。
The images were distorted by refraction. = 图像因折射而变形。

疑问句:
What causes refraction of light? = 什么导致光的折射？
How does refraction affect the image? = 折射如何影响图像？

否定句:
The experiment did not show significant refraction. = 实验没有显示明显的折射。
There was no noticeable refraction in this case. = 在这种情况下没有明显的折射。


PHRASE->
index of refraction= 折射率
refraction of light= 光的折射
atmospheric refraction= 大气折射
refractive index= 折射率
double refraction= 双折射
