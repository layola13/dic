diploe:/ˈdɪploʊ/| n.|双板, 偶极子|A diploe is a structure composed of two parallel plates separated by a layer of material, often used in various contexts like in the skull or in electrical engineering.  A diploe in the skull refers to the layer of spongy bone between the inner and outer tables of the skull. In physics, a dipole is a pair of equal and opposite charges separated by a small distance. |例句：The diploe of the skull protects the brain.  颅骨的双板保护着大脑。|例句：The electric dipole moment is a measure of the separation of positive and negative charges within a system. 电偶极矩是衡量系统内正负电荷分离程度的量度。|近义词：double layer, doublet|反义词：monoploe
