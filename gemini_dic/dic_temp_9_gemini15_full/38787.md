conductible:/kənˈdʌktəbl/ | adj. | 可导电的，传导的 | Capable of conducting electricity, heat, or sound.  | Example: Copper is a highly conductible metal. 铜是一种高度导电的金属。 The material is highly conductible to heat.  这种材料具有很高的导热性。| 近义词：conducting, transmissive | 反义词：nonconductive, insulating


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The wire is conductible. = 这根电线是导电的。
This material is highly conductible to heat. = 这种材料具有很高的导热性。

一般过去时:
The old wiring was less conductible than the new one. = 旧线路的导电性不如新线路。
The experiment showed that the substance was conductible. = 实验表明该物质是导电的。

现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered new materials that are more conductible. = 科学家们已经发现了导电性更好的新材料。
The research has shown that this material is highly conductible. = 研究表明这种材料具有很高的导电性。

过去完成时:
Engineers had determined that the old pipes were no longer conductible. = 工程师们已经确定旧管道不再导热。
They had found that the material was not as conductible as they had initially thought. = 他们发现这种材料的导电性不如他们最初想象的那么好。

将来时:
Future technologies will utilize more conductible materials. = 未来技术将利用更多导电材料。
The new design will make the system more conductible. = 新的设计将使系统更具导电性。

虚拟语气:
If the material were more conductible, the device would work better. = 如果材料导电性更好，设备将工作得更好。
I wish this material were more conductible. = 我希望这种材料导电性更好。

被动语态:
The conductivity of the wire was tested to ensure it was conductible. = 对电线的导电性进行了测试，以确保其导电。
The material's conductibility is being examined for its suitability. = 正在检查这种材料的导电性以确定其适用性。

疑问句:
Is this wire conductible? = 这根电线导电吗？
Are these materials conductible enough for the project? = 这些材料的导电性足以用于该项目吗？

否定句:
The plastic is not conductible. = 塑料不导电。
That material is not conductible to electricity. = 那种材料不导电。


PHRASE->
highly conductible = 高度导电的
good conductibility = 良好的导电性
electrical conductible = 电导性
thermal conductible = 热导性
poor conductible = 导电性差
