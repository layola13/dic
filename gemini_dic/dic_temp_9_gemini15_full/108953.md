词源:  The word "leeriest" is the superlative form of "leery," which itself is of uncertain origin.  Some etymologists suggest a connection to  "leer," meaning a sideways glance, often suggestive of suspicion or ill intent.  The evolution from a physical glance to a state of suspicion is a semantic shift typical of language development.  However, a definitive etymological link is not universally agreed upon.
