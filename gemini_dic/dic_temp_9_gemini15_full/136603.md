词源:
The word "nonsanguinely" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adverb "sanguinely."  "Sanguinely" comes from the adjective "sanguine," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "sanguis," meaning "blood." In older usage, "sanguine" referred to someone with a ruddy complexion (associated with good health), and thus, optimistic and cheerful.  The modern meaning of "sanguine" retains this association with optimism.  Therefore, "nonsanguinely" means "not optimistically," or "pessimistically."
