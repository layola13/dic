The word "communitarian" originates from the word "community," which comes from the Old French "communauté" and ultimately from the Latin "communitas," meaning "common possession" or "commonality."  The suffix "-arian" is added to create a word signifying a believer in or adherent to a particular doctrine or system.  Therefore, "communitarian" literally refers to someone who believes in the importance of community.
