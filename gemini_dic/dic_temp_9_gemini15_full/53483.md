词源:

The word "disarray" itself comes from the Old French "desarraier," meaning "to disarm" or "to disorder."  The prefix "dis-" indicates negation or reversal, while the root relates to the concept of array (meaning arrangement or order).  Therefore, "disarray" literally means "lack of array" or "to put out of array."  The "'s" is a standard possessive marker in English.
