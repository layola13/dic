quaternion:/ˈkwætərniən/| n. |四元数|A quaternion is a mathematical object used to represent rotations in three-dimensional space. It's a four-dimensional extension of complex numbers, consisting of a real part and three imaginary parts. Quaternions provide a concise and efficient way to perform rotations, avoiding the complexities and potential issues associated with other rotation representations like Euler angles or rotation matrices. They are commonly used in computer graphics, robotics, and aerospace engineering for representing orientations and rotations of objects.|Example:  Quaternions are used in video games to smoothly rotate 3D models. = 四元数用于电子游戏中平滑旋转3D模型。|近义词：rotation representation (旋转表示法)|反义词：无
