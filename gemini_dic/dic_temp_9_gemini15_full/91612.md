hyperangelically: /ˌhaɪpərænˈdʒɛlɪkli/ | adv. | 超越天使般地，极其完美地 | Extremely perfectly; in a way that surpasses angelic qualities.  This word is not commonly used and is considered a neologism (newly coined word). It combines "hyper-" (excessively, beyond) with "angelic" (of or like an angel).  It implies a degree of perfection or goodness exceeding that typically associated with angels.
