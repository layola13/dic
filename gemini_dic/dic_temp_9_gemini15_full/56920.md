PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "dotehead".  The word itself functions as a single, standalone insult.

词源:
The word "dotehead" is a compound word. "Dote" originally meant to be foolishly fond of or excessively attached to someone or something.  "Head" refers to the mind or intellect.  Therefore, a "dotehead" is someone whose mind is characterized by foolishness or excessive fondness to the point of silliness.  The exact etymology of its combination is difficult to pinpoint to a specific date, but its usage reflects a natural combination of these two words to create a single descriptive term.
