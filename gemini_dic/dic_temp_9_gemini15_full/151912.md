词源:
The word "pastern" comes from the Old French word "pasture," meaning "pastureland" or "grazing land," ultimately derived from the Latin word "pastor," meaning "shepherd."  The connection is that the pastern joint is relatively low to the ground, similar to how a shepherd's flock grazes.  Over time, the meaning shifted to refer specifically to the anatomical part of the horse's leg.
