词源:

The word is a compound of "earth" and "shattering."  "Shattering" implies breaking or destroying something completely.  When applied to "earth," it creates a metaphor suggesting an event of such magnitude that it shakes the very foundations of the world, or at least, a significant part of it.


用法说明:

Earth-shattering is primarily used as an adjective to describe events, news, or discoveries that are exceptionally surprising, impactful, and often transformative.  It emphasizes the profound and significant nature of the event.  It's generally used in a figurative sense, not literally implying the earth is physically breaking apart.


例句补充：

* The invention of the internet was an earth-shattering event.  互联网的发明是一件惊天动地的大事。
* His unexpected confession was earth-shattering.  他意外的忏悔令人震惊。


由于earth-shattering本身就是一个形容词，因此没有动词、名词等其他词性变化和相应的时态变化。  它只用于修饰名词。
