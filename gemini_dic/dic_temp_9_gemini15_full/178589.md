/riːˈkɒstjuːmz/ | n. |重新服装，重新装扮 |  The word "recostumes" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a blend of "re-" (meaning again or anew) and "costumes."  It would likely refer to the act of changing or replacing costumes, or perhaps the process of creating new costumes for a repeat performance or a different production.  There's no established dictionary definition or common usage. | Example: The theater company is recostuming the play for its summer tour. 剧团正在为夏季巡演重新设计服装。| 近义词:re-dress, refit, redesign (costumes) | 反义词:  None directly, but the opposite action could be keeping the same costumes.
