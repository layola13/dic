词源:

The word "interclouded" is a compound word formed from the prefix "inter-" meaning "between, among, or mutually," and the word "clouded," which describes something obscured by clouds.  Therefore, "interclouded" literally means "mutually clouded" or "clouded together."  The word demonstrates the combining of "inter" and "clouded" to create a more nuanced description of a clouded state.
