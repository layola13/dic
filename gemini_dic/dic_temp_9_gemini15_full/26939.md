近义词：spur, projection, process, outgrowth

反义词：None specifically, as it describes a structure, not a quality.


词源:  From Latin *calx, calcis "heel", "limestone," related to Greek χαλίξ (khálīx) "pebble," "gravel". The Latin word came to refer to a spur-like projection, hence its use in zoology and botany to describe similar structures.
