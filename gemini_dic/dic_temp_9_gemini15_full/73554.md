词源:

The word "forestall" comes from the Old English "forstallen," which is a compound of "for-" (meaning "before" or "against") and "stallen" (meaning "to set, place, or put").  The original meaning was to "set something before" or "anticipate" and has evolved to its current meaning of preventing something by acting beforehand.
