反义词: decorum, propriety, seemliness, politeness, courtesy

词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "decorousness," which derives from the French word "décorum" and ultimately from the Latin word "decor," meaning "beauty," "grace," or "order."  Therefore, "nondecorousness" literally means "not having decorum" or "lack of proper behavior."
