词源:  From Middle English *kindrednesse, from kindrede "kinship, kindred," from Old English cynræden, from cyn "kin, race" + -ræden "-ship, -hood".  The suffix "-ness" indicates a state or quality.  Therefore, the word originally referred to acts of kindness within a kinship group, but its meaning has broadened over time.
