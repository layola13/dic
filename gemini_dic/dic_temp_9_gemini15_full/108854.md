词源:
The word "lecher" ultimately derives from the Old French word "lecheor," meaning "licker," which in turn came from the Latin word "licere," meaning "to entice, allure, or charm." The sexual connotation developed over time, associating the act of "licking" metaphorically with sexual desire and pursuit.
