The word "ruers" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Possible intended words might depend on context. For example, it could be "rulers," "ruers" (as a plural of a made-up word), or a similar word.

2. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (a name), a place name, or a term specific to a certain field.  More context is needed.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a slang term, or jargon within a specific community.  Again, additional context is essential.


Without knowing the intended word or context, it's impossible to provide the requested information (phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms).  Please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
