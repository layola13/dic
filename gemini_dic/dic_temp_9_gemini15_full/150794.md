The word "paradox-ologies" does not exist as a standard English word.  It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, possibly formed by combining "paradox" and "-ologies" (a suffix indicating the study of multiple subjects).  Therefore, a full analysis in the requested format is not possible.  However, we can analyze the constituent parts:


**Paradox:**

/ˈpærədɒks/ | /ˈpærədɑːks/ | n. |悖论，矛盾；似是而非的论点 | A statement or proposition that seems self-contradictory or absurd but in reality expresses a possible truth.  | Example:  The paradox of saving money by spending money (on things that increase productivity or efficiency).  悖论在于省钱的方法是花钱（在能提高生产力或效率的事情上）。| Near synonyms: contradiction, inconsistency, anomaly | Antonyms:  truth, certainty, consistency | noun


**-ologies:**

This is a suffix derived from the Greek word "-logia," meaning "study of" or "speech about." It is used to form words denoting the study of a particular subject or field.  For example, "biology" (study of life), "geology" (study of Earth), "psychology" (study of the mind).  It's not a standalone word.


**Hypothetical Analysis of "Paradox-ologies" (if it existed):**

If "paradox-ologies" were to be a word, it might refer to:

* **The study of paradoxes:** This could involve analyzing different types of paradoxes, their logical structure, their implications in various fields (philosophy, mathematics, physics), and their resolution or interpretation.
* **The study of multiple paradoxes:**  This could be an expansion of the above, looking at the interplay and relationships between different paradoxes.

Given this potential meaning, we can offer a tentative entry, acknowledging its non-standard nature:

**Paradox-ologies:**

/ˌpærəˈdɒksɒlədʒiz/ | /ˌpærəˈdɑːksɒlədʒiz/ | n. | 悖论学 (假设的学科名称) | (Hypothetical) The study of paradoxes and their diverse manifestations across various fields of knowledge. | Example:  Research in paradox-ologies explores the inherent contradictions in quantum mechanics. 悖论学的研究探索了量子力学中固有的矛盾。| Near synonyms: (None, as it's a hypothetical term)  | Antonyms: (None, as it's a hypothetical term) | noun


**Note:** The pronunciation is a best guess based on the pronunciation of "paradox" and "-ologies."  The example sentence is illustrative and speculative.  The lack of established usage means near synonyms and antonyms cannot be provided.  The grammar sections are not applicable as this is not a standard word with established grammatical usage.

Because "paradox-ologies" isn't a real word, the USAGE, PHRASE sections are not applicable.  The word would need to be established and used in the English language before a full grammatical analysis could be performed.
