Etymology:

The word "disseminations" is derived from the verb "disseminate," which itself comes from the Latin word "disseminare."  "Disseminare" is composed of the prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart" or "away"), and "seminare" (meaning "to sow"). Therefore, the literal meaning of "disseminate" is "to sow apart" or "to scatter seed."  This agricultural imagery reflects the core meaning of spreading something widely.
