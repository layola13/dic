词源:

The word "carolling" derives from the Old French word "carole," meaning a round dance or song, often accompanied by singing.  This word ultimately traces back to the Latin word "choraula," which also referred to a type of round dance and song.  The act of "carolling," therefore, is rooted in a long tradition of festive communal singing and dancing.
