词源:
The word "ostracization" is derived from the Greek word "ostrakismos," which refers to the ancient Athenian practice of ostracism, where citizens could vote to banish a person from the city-state for a period of ten years.  The Greek word "ostrakon" meaning "potsherd" or "shell" refers to the pottery shards used as ballots in this process.
