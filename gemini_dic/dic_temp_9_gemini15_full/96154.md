词源:
The word "indentured" comes from the Middle English word "indenture," which refers to a contract written in duplicate, with each copy indented (having a jagged edge) to match the other.  This was done to prevent forgery.  The practice of indentured servitude is ancient, originating in various forms across different cultures and time periods.  The term eventually came to describe the specific legal relationship of a person bound to service under a contract.
