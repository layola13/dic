词源:
The word "misrelying" is formed by combining the prefix "mis-" (meaning "wrongly" or "badly") with the verb "relying".  "Relying" comes from the Old French "relier" meaning "to bind back" or "to unite again," ultimately deriving from the Latin "religare".  Therefore, "misrelying" signifies a wrongful or incorrect act of relying or trusting.
