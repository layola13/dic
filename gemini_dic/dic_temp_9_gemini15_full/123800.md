词源:
The word "mope" is of uncertain origin.  Some etymologists suggest a possible connection to Middle Dutch "moppen," meaning "to make wry faces," or to a similar word in Low German.  However, the exact path of its development into English is unclear.  Its current meaning, indicating a state of listlessness and low spirits, solidified over time.
