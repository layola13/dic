permutable:/pərˈmjuːtəbl/ | adj. | 可交换的；可置换的 | Capable of being interchanged or rearranged.  Something that is permutable can have its components switched around without altering the overall result or meaning.  | Example: The letters in the word "ABLE" are permutable, as they can be rearranged to form "ABLE", "ALBE", "BAEL", etc., all of which are valid words (though not all might be in common use).  The elements of a set are permutable if their order does not affect their overall significance. |近义词: interchangeable, reversible, substitutable | 反义词: immutable, fixed, invariable
