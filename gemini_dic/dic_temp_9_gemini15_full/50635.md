词源:
derive from the verb "deride," which comes from the Old French word "derider," meaning "to laugh at," "to mock," or "to scorn."  The Old French word itself has roots in the Latin verb "deridere," a compound of "de-" (intensive prefix) and "ridere" (to laugh).  Therefore, the core meaning traces back to the simple act of laughing at something or someone.
