词源:

The word "overjealous" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the adjective "jealous."  "Jealous" itself originates from the Old French *gelos, ultimately from the Latin *zelosus, meaning "zealous, envious." The evolution reflects a shift from a more general sense of zeal to a more specifically negative connotation of envy and possessiveness.
