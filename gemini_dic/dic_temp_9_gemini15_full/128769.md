The word "nighest" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a very uncommon regional variant.  The intended word is probably one of the following:

* **Nearest:** /ˈnɪərɪst/ | adj. | 最近的，最接近的 | Closest in distance or time. | Example: The nearest hospital is five miles away.  最近的医院在五英里外。| 近义词：closest, next | 反义词：farthest, furthest

* **Nightest:** (Hypothetical) This could be a potential misspelling attempting to create a superlative of "night," implying the darkest or longest night.  However, this is not a standard word.


Since "nighest" doesn't exist, I cannot provide a full analysis including usage examples, phrases, etc., as requested in the format.  If you meant "nearest," please let me know, and I will provide the complete analysis as requested.
