词源:
The name "palladium" comes from the asteroid Pallas, which was discovered in 1802, a year before the discovery of the element.  The asteroid was named after Pallas Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom and warfare.  The discoverer, William Hyde Wollaston, named the element after the asteroid to reflect the rarity and preciousness of both the asteroid and the element.
