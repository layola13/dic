ochlocracy:/ˈɒklɒkrəsi/ | n. |乌合之众统治；暴民统治 | Government by the mob; rule by the masses, especially when characterized by disorder and violence.  Ochlocracy differs from democracy in that it lacks the structures and processes that ensure the protection of individual rights and the rule of law. In an ochlocracy, the will of the majority is imposed without regard for individual liberties or due process. | Example: The overthrow of the government was a clear example of ochlocracy, as the mob acted without restraint or regard for the legal processes.  暴民推翻政府是乌合之众统治的典型例子，因为暴民肆无忌惮，不顾法律程序。| 近义词：mobocracy, mob rule | 反义词：democracy, aristocracy
