USAGE->
This word is a proper noun and does not have verb conjugations or other grammatical variations like other word classes.  It functions solely as a name and therefore doesn't take part in typical verb tenses, aspects or moods.  There is no need to illustrate tenses, aspects or moods for a proper noun.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly associated with the name Humphrey itself.  Phrases would involve its use within a sentence, such as "Humphrey Bogart," but those are phrases involving the name, not grammatical constructions *of* the name.
