Etymology:  The word "gridironed" comes from the noun "gridiron," which itself is a combination of "grid" and "iron."  Originally, a gridiron was a cooking utensil made of iron bars arranged in a grid pattern. The word's metaphorical extension to describe a surface marked with a grid-like pattern followed naturally from this visual similarity.  The suffix "-ed" transforms the noun into an adjective, describing something that resembles or has the qualities of a gridiron.
