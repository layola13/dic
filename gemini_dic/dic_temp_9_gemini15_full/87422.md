The word "herum" is not an English word.  It appears to be a German word.  Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis following the requested format for English words.  To provide a similar analysis, you would need to specify the language (German in this case) and I can then provide information on its pronunciation, parts of speech, meaning, usage, etc.
