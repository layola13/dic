词源:
The word "mathematician" comes from the Middle English word "mathematicien," which in turn derives from the Old French word "mathematicien."  These words ultimately trace their origins back to the Greek word "μαθηματικός" (mathēmatikós), meaning "relating to learning,"  which itself is derived from "μάθημα" (máthēma), meaning "learning" or "science."  The "-ician" suffix is a common English agentive suffix indicating a person who practices a particular skill or profession.
