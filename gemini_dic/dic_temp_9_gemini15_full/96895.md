词源:

The word "inexpensiveness" is derived from the adjective "inexpensive," which itself combines the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") with "expensive."  "Expensive" comes from the Old French "espense," meaning "expense," ultimately from the Latin "expensa," the past participle of "expendere," meaning "to weigh out, expend."  Therefore, "inexpensiveness" literally means "the state of not being expensive."
