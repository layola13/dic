The word "palsical" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it is impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical information following the requested format.  It might be a misspelling, a newly coined word, or a word from a specialized field not widely known.  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer some assistance.
