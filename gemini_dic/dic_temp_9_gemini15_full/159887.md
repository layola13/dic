polymorphemic:/ˌpɒliˈmɔːrfɪmɪk/ /ˌpɑːliˈmɔːrfɪmɪk/ | adj. | 多形的；多态的 |  Relating to or characterized by polymorphism; having multiple forms.  This term is primarily used in linguistics and biology, referring to the ability of a word or organism to exist in multiple forms. In linguistics, it often refers to words with multiple meanings or forms (depending on context). In biology, it refers to the ability of an organism to take on multiple forms. | Example:  The polymorphemic nature of the word "bank" (financial institution vs. river bank) makes it challenging for language learners.  多义词“bank”（金融机构与河岸）的多形性使得语言学习者难以掌握。|近义词：multiform, multifaceted, polymorphic|反义词：monomorphic, uniform
