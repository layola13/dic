词源:  From Middle English *heythenrye, from Old English hæþen + -ry (suffix forming nouns of action or state).  "Heathen" itself ultimately derives from Proto-Germanic *haiþaną, meaning "one who lives on the heath," a reference to people living outside of settled, Christianized areas.  The association with "unbelief" or "paganism" developed later.
