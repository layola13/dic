词源:
The word "ideologist" comes from the French word "idéologue," which was coined during the French Revolution. It is a combination of the Greek words "idea" (idea, concept) and "-logy" (study of).  The term initially carried a negative connotation, implying someone whose ideas were impractical and detached from reality. However, over time, its usage has broadened to encompass anyone who strongly adheres to a particular ideology.
