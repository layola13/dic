pterylosis:/ˌtɛrɪˈloʊsɪs/ | n. | 羽毛分布；羽区 | The scientific study of the arrangement of feathers on a bird's body.  Pterylosis describes the pattern and distribution of feathers, including the areas where feathers are present (pterylae) and absent (apteria).  It is important for understanding avian morphology, evolution, and taxonomy. | Example: The pterylosis of owls is quite distinctive, differing significantly from that of raptors.  猫头鹰的羽毛分布非常独特，与猛禽的羽毛分布有很大不同。|近义词：feather arrangement, feather distribution |反义词：无
