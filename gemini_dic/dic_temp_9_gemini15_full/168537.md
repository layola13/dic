procaryotic:/ˌproʊkæriˈɑːtɪk/| adj.|原核的，原核生物的| Belonging to or relating to prokaryotes, organisms whose cells lack a defined nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.  Prokaryotic cells are smaller and simpler than eukaryotic cells.  The term is often used to describe the cells themselves, as well as their genetic material or other features.| Example: Bacteria are procaryotic organisms.|近义词：prokaryal|反义词：eukaryotic

将来时:
Scientists will continue to study procaryotic organisms. = 科学家们将继续研究原核生物。
We will learn more about the evolution of procaryotic life. = 我们将学习更多关于原核生命进化的知识。


虚拟语气:
If the cell were procaryotic, it would lack a nucleus. = 如果细胞是原核的，它将缺乏细胞核。
