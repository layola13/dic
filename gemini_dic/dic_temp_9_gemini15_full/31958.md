chemical bonds:/ˈkɛmɪkəl bɑːndz/ | n. |化学键 |A chemical bond is a lasting attraction between atoms, ions or molecules that enables the formation of chemical compounds.  The bond may result from the electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions as in ionic bonds or through the sharing of electrons as in covalent bonds.  The strength of chemical bonds varies; some are strong and others are weak. | Example: The strong chemical bonds within a diamond make it exceptionally hard.  钻石内部强大的化学键使其异常坚硬。 The weak hydrogen bonds between water molecules are responsible for many of water's unique properties. 水分子之间的弱氢键是许多水的独特性质的原因。|近义词：chemical linkage, molecular bond |反义词：No direct antonym, but the opposite concept would be the absence of bonding, or physical separation.
