词源：
The word "fathomable" comes from the noun "fathom," meaning a unit of length equal to six feet, used to measure the depth of water.  The ability to "fathom" something originally referred to the ability to measure its depth, both literally and figuratively.  Thus, "fathomable" describes something that can be measured and therefore understood.  The ultimate origin is from Old English *fæþm.
