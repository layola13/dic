词源:

The word "disinvestment" is formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "the opposite of" or "removal of") to the word "investment."  "Investment" itself comes from the Old French word "investir," meaning "to clothe, invest with," ultimately deriving from the Latin "investire," which has the same meaning.  The shift in meaning from "clothing" to "putting money into" reflects the idea of resources being put into something, similar to how clothing invests a person with appearance and status.
