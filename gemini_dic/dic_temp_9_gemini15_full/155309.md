词源:

The word "fantastic" ultimately derives from the Italian word "fantastico," meaning "fanciful" or "imaginary."  It entered English in the 16th century, initially used to describe something unreal or imaginative. Over time, its meaning shifted to encompass something exceptionally good or wonderful.  The root is "fantasma" (ghost or phantom), illustrating the original connection to the unreal.
