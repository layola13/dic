drumlins:/ˈdrʌmlɪnz/| n.|鼓丘|Elongated hills formed by glacial action, typically having a smooth, elongated shape with a steeper slope on one side and a gentler slope on the other.  They are composed of glacial till and are often found in groups.  The exact formation process is still debated, but it is generally believed to involve the deposition of sediment by a glacier moving over previously deposited material. |例句：The landscape was dotted with numerous drumlins, testament to the power of the ancient glaciers.  那片风景点缀着许多鼓丘，证明了古代冰川的力量。
The field trip included a stop to examine the geological formation of the drumlins.  实地考察包括参观考察鼓丘的地质构造。|近义词：glacial landform, moraine (though moraines have different characteristics)|反义词：N/A
