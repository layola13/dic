The word "nonepic" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  It's likely a newly coined word or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's probably a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "epic" (referring to something grand, heroic, or on a large scale).  Thus, it likely means "not epic," "unepic," or "unremarkable."

To illustrate how this hypothetical word might be used, let's create an entry based on its probable meaning:

nonepic: /nɑːnˈɛpɪk/ | adj. | 不史诗的，不壮观的，平淡无奇的 | Not epic; lacking in grandeur, heroism, or remarkable scale.  It describes something ordinary or insignificant. | 例句：The movie was nonepic; a simple story with predictable plot points.  这部电影不史诗；一个情节可预测的简单故事。
