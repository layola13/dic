otocyst:/ˈoʊtəsɪst/| n. |耳囊；听泡|The otocyst is the primordium of the inner ear, developing from the otic placode during the embryonic stage. It's a small, fluid-filled sac that gives rise to the various structures of the inner ear, including the cochlea and semicircular canals.  The development of the otocyst is a complex process involving cell signaling and differentiation.|The developing otocyst undergoes a series of morphological changes to eventually form the functional inner ear. |近义词：otic vesicle, auditory vesicle|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The otocyst develops from the otic placode. = 耳囊由耳板发育而来。
The otocyst contains sensory cells. = 耳囊含有感觉细胞。


一般过去时:
The researchers studied the otocyst development. = 研究人员研究了耳囊的发育。
The otocyst differentiated into various structures. = 耳囊分化成各种结构。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the genetics of otocyst formation. = 科学家们已经研究了耳囊形成的遗传学。
Researchers have identified key genes involved in otocyst development. = 研究人员已经确定了参与耳囊发育的关键基因。


过去完成时:
Before differentiation, the otocyst was a simple vesicle. = 在分化之前，耳囊是一个简单的囊泡。
The cells had already begun to migrate before the otocyst fully formed. = 在耳囊完全形成之前，细胞就已经开始迁移了。


将来时:
Further research will investigate the molecular mechanisms of otocyst development. = 进一步的研究将调查耳囊发育的分子机制。
This study will help us understand how the otocyst forms. = 这项研究将帮助我们了解耳囊是如何形成的。


虚拟语气:
If the otocyst didn't develop properly, hearing loss could result. = 如果耳囊发育不正常，可能会导致听力损失。
It would be helpful if we knew more about otocyst development. = 如果我们对耳囊发育了解更多，将会有所帮助。


被动语态:
The otocyst is influenced by various signaling pathways. = 耳囊受到各种信号通路的的影响。
The formation of the otocyst is regulated by genes. = 耳囊的形成受基因调控。


疑问句:
What are the key signaling pathways involved in otocyst development? = 参与耳囊发育的关键信号通路是什么？
How does the otocyst differentiate into the various structures of the inner ear? = 耳囊是如何分化成内耳的各种结构的？


否定句:
The otocyst does not develop in isolation. = 耳囊并非孤立发育。
The otocyst is not fully formed at birth. = 耳囊在出生时并没有完全形成。


PHRASE->
otocyst development = 耳囊发育
otocyst formation = 耳囊形成
otocyst differentiation = 耳囊分化
malformation of the otocyst = 耳囊畸形
