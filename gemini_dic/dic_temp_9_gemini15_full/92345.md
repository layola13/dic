hypoblast: /ˈhaɪpoʊblæst/ | n. | 次胚层 | The hypoblast is a thin layer of cells that forms during the early stages of embryonic development in animals, specifically in the bilaminar germ disc. It contributes to the formation of extraembryonic tissues, such as the yolk sac, but does not contribute to the embryo itself.  It is located below the epiblast. | The hypoblast is crucial for establishing the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo and for guiding cell migration during gastrulation. | 近义词：primitive endoderm (原肠内胚层) | 反义词：epiblast (上胚层)


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the context of embryology and developmental biology, and therefore doesn't have common usage in everyday language.  Grammatical structures are illustrated using other words, since "hypoblast" is primarily a noun.


一般现在时:
The hypoblast forms early in development. = 次胚层在发育早期形成。
The hypoblast contributes to the yolk sac. = 次胚层有助于卵黄囊的形成。


一般过去时:
The hypoblast had already formed by day 14. = 到第14天次胚层已经形成了。
Researchers studied the hypoblast's role in axis formation. = 研究人员研究了次胚层在轴向形成中的作用。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified key genes involved in hypoblast development. = 科学家们已经确定了参与次胚层发育的关键基因。
Much research has been dedicated to understanding the hypoblast. = 许多研究致力于了解次胚层。


过去完成时:
Before gastrulation, the hypoblast was already established. = 在原肠胚形成之前，次胚层已经建立。
The researchers had observed the hypoblast's migration patterns. = 研究人员已经观察到次胚层的迁移模式。


将来时:
Further studies will investigate the hypoblast's molecular mechanisms. = 后续研究将调查次胚层的分子机制。
Scientists will continue to explore the function of the hypoblast. = 科学家们将继续探索次胚层的功用。


虚拟语气:
If the hypoblast were damaged, development would be severely affected. = 如果次胚层受损，发育将受到严重影响。
It is hypothesized that if the hypoblast were absent, embryonic development would fail. = 假设如果次胚层不存在，胚胎发育将失败。


被动语态:
The hypoblast is often studied using microscopy techniques. = 次胚层通常使用显微镜技术进行研究。
The formation of the hypoblast is influenced by several signaling pathways. = 次胚层的形成受多种信号通路的调控。


疑问句:
What is the role of the hypoblast in gastrulation? = 次胚层在原肠胚形成中的作用是什么？
How does the hypoblast contribute to extraembryonic development? = 次胚层如何促进胚外发育？


否定句:
The hypoblast does not directly form embryonic tissues. = 次胚层不直接形成胚胎组织。
The hypoblast is not solely responsible for axis determination. = 次胚层并非唯一负责轴向决定的结构。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "hypoblast".  The term is highly specialized.  Phrases would be built around its function:  "hypoblast development," "hypoblast differentiation," "hypoblast migration," "hypoblast signaling," "hypoblast formation."
