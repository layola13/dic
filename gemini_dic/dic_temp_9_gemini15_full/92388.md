词源:
The word "hypocritical" derives from the Greek word "hypokritēs" (ὑποκριτής), meaning "actor," "interpreter," or "one who answers."  In ancient Greece, actors would often take on roles and portray characters different from themselves.  This sense of playing a part or feigning something led to the association with insincerity and deception.  The word then entered English through Latin and Old French, evolving to its modern meaning of feigning virtue or religious devotion.
