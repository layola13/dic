The word "Cataian" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or an archaic/obsolete word.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need to understand what word you intended.  Is it possibly a variant spelling of a known word, or perhaps a proper noun from a specific context (e.g., a place name, a person's name)?  Please clarify.
