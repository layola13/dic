The word "{remends}" is not a valid English word.  There is no word in standard English dictionaries with that spelling.  It's possible there's a misspelling or it's a word from a very specialized field or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  Please double-check the spelling and provide the correct word.
