nonmyelinated: /ˌnɒnˈmaɪəleɪtɪd/ | adj. | 无髓鞘的 |  Lacking a myelin sheath.  Myelin is a fatty substance that surrounds and insulates nerve fibers, increasing the speed of nerve impulse transmission.  Nonmyelinated nerves transmit impulses more slowly than myelinated nerves. | Example: Nonmyelinated nerve fibers are slower to conduct signals than myelinated ones.  无髓鞘神经纤维比有髓鞘的神经纤维传导信号慢。 | 近义词: unmyelinated | 反义词: myelinated

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The nerve fibers are nonmyelinated. = 神经纤维是无髓鞘的。
This type of neuron is nonmyelinated. = 这种神经元是无髓鞘的。


一般过去时:
The scientists found that the axons were nonmyelinated. = 科学家们发现轴突是无髓鞘的。
The research showed the nerve was nonmyelinated. = 研究表明神经是无髓鞘的。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several nonmyelinated pathways in the brain. = 研究人员已经在大脑中发现了几个无髓鞘的通路。
Studies have shown that nonmyelinated nerves are more susceptible to damage. = 研究表明无髓鞘神经更容易受到损伤。


过去完成时:
They had already determined that the nerve was nonmyelinated before the experiment began. = 他们在实验开始之前就已经确定了神经是无髓鞘的。
It had been previously shown that nonmyelinated fibers conduct impulses more slowly. = 早些时候已经证明无髓鞘纤维传导冲动更慢。


将来时:
We will examine the nonmyelinated nerves under the microscope. = 我们将在显微镜下检查无髓鞘神经。
Future research will focus on the function of nonmyelinated axons. = 未来的研究将集中在无髓鞘轴突的功能上。


虚拟语气:
If the nerve were nonmyelinated, the signal transmission would be slower. = 如果神经是无髓鞘的，信号传输就会更慢。
I wish I had known the nerve fibers were nonmyelinated earlier. = 我希望我早点知道神经纤维是无髓鞘的。


被动语态:
The nonmyelinated axons were observed using electron microscopy. = 使用电子显微镜观察了无髓鞘轴突。
The presence of nonmyelinated fibers was confirmed by the experiment. = 实验证实了无髓鞘纤维的存在。


疑问句:
Are these nerve fibers myelinated or nonmyelinated? = 这些神经纤维是有髓鞘的还是无髓鞘的？
Is the transmission speed slower because the nerve is nonmyelinated? = 神经传导速度较慢是因为它无髓鞘吗？


否定句:
The nerve fibers are not nonmyelinated; they are myelinated. = 神经纤维不是无髓鞘的；它们是有髓鞘的。
The study did not find evidence of nonmyelinated pathways in this region. = 该研究未发现该区域存在无髓鞘通路的证据。


PHRASE->
nonmyelinated axon: 无髓鞘轴突
nonmyelinated nerve fibers: 无髓鞘神经纤维
nonmyelinated neuron: 无髓鞘神经元
nonmyelinated sheath: 无髓鞘鞘
nonmyelinated pathways: 无髓鞘通路
