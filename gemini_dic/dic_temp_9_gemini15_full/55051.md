Etymology:

The word "disquisition" comes from the Latin word "disquisitio," which is a combination of "disquirere" (to inquire, investigate) and the suffix "-ition" (the act of).  Therefore, the word literally means "the act of inquiring into" or "a thorough investigation."


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb or adjective forms commonly used.  Therefore, tense conjugations are not applicable.  The word itself describes a completed act of writing or speaking.  The usage revolves around the subject matter of the disquisition.
