decelerators:/dɪˈsɛləreɪtərz/| n. |减速器；减速装置|Things that cause a decrease in speed or rate.  Decelerators can refer to physical devices like brakes or parachutes, or to abstract concepts like economic policies designed to slow growth.|例句：The aircraft deployed its decelerators to slow its descent.飞机展开减速伞以减缓下降速度。

The new safety regulations include improved decelerators on all vehicles. 新的安全条例包括所有车辆改进减速装置。|近义词：retarders, brakes, dampeners|反义词：accelerators
