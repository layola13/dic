词源:

The word "mischievous" comes from the Old French word *meschief*, meaning "misfortune," "evil," or "harm."  This in turn derives from the Old North French word *mescheef*, which itself comes from the Old French words *mes-* (bad, ill) and *chief* (head, chief).  The "-ous" suffix was added to create the adjective form.  Therefore, the original meaning was related to causing harm or misfortune, but the modern usage emphasizes the playful and often harmless nature of the mischief.
