词源:
The word "overdepressive" is a compound word formed from the prefix "over-" meaning "excessively" or "too much" and the adjective "depressive" meaning "characterized by or causing depression".  The root of "depressive" ultimately comes from the Latin word "deprimere," meaning "to press down," reflecting the feeling of being weighed down by sadness.
