词源:
The word "overstarching" is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the verb "starch," which originally referred to stiffening fabric with starch.  In this context, "starch" implies rigidity, firmness, and an exaggerated emphasis. The evolution of the word reflects a figurative extension of the meaning of "starch" to denote an excessively rigid or inflexible approach to a subject.
