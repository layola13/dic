The word "incruental" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or fictional context.  Therefore, I cannot provide a complete analysis according to your requested format.
