词源:

The word "continuously" derives from the Latin word "continuare," meaning "to continue."  This Latin word itself is built from the prefix "con-" (meaning "together" or "thoroughly") and the verb "tinere," meaning "to hold." Thus, "continuare" originally meant to "hold together" or "to keep going."  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective "continuous" into an adverb, indicating manner or way.
