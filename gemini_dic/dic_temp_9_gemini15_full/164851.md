英文解析：

The term "preformative" relates to the philosophical concept of speech acts, particularly as developed by J.L. Austin and John Searle.  A preformative utterance is one that, by its very nature, *does* something.  It's not merely a statement describing a state of affairs; it *performs* an action.  The success of a preformative depends heavily on the context (the speaker's authority, the sincerity of the utterance, etc.).


例句：

*   Saying "I apologize" is a preformative act; it's not just stating that you apologize, but actually performing the act of apologizing.  说“对不起”是一种施为行为；它不仅仅是说明你在道歉，而是在进行道歉的行为。

*   The phrase "I bet you $10 it will rain" is preformative because it simultaneously expresses a belief and creates a bet. 短语“我赌10美元会下雨”是施为的，因为它同时表达了一种信念并创造了一个赌注。


词性：

Primarily used as an adjective, describing a type of utterance or action.  It can sometimes be used as a noun, but less frequently.


There is no direct equivalent of the detailed grammatical tense examples provided for the word "what" because "preformative" describes a *kind* of utterance, not a grammatical structure.  The tense of the preformative utterance itself can vary, of course.  For example:

* **Past Tense Preformative:** "I promised to help you yesterday." 我昨天答应过帮你。
* **Present Tense Preformative:** "I promise to help you now." 我现在答应帮你。
* **Future Tense Preformative:** "I will promise to help you tomorrow." 我明天会答应帮你。


PHRASE->

There aren't common phrases directly using "preformative" as a core element.  The concept is more theoretical than colloquial.  However, we can illustrate the idea with examples of preformative utterances in phrasal form:

*   "I hereby declare..." 我在此宣布...
*   "I vow to..." 我发誓要...
*   "I order you to..." 我命令你...
*   "I nominate..." 我提名...
*   "I christen this ship..." 我为这艘船命名...
