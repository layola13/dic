The word "but's" is not a standard English word. It's a contraction of "but is" or, less commonly, a misspelling of "but's" (possessive form of "but").  Therefore, a full lexical entry as requested is impossible.  I can, however, provide information on "but" and its usage with "is".

**"but is"**

This phrase simply combines the conjunction "but" with the verb "is". It functions as a subordinate clause introducing a contrasting idea or fact within a sentence. There are no special grammatical rules or unique usage patterns beyond the standard use of "but" and "is".


Example: He is tired, but is determined to finish the project.  (他很累，但决心完成这个项目。)


**"but's" (possessive)**

This form is extremely rare and unconventional.  It's better to use a phrasing like "the but of..." to express possession.  For example, instead of "the but's end," it's better to say "the end of the but."
