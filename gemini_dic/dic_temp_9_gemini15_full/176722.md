reactivity:/ˌriːækˈtɪvəti/| n. |反应性，活性|The capacity of a substance to undergo chemical reaction.  It refers to how readily a substance participates in chemical reactions. This can be influenced by factors such as temperature, concentration, and the presence of catalysts. |Example:  The reactivity of alkali metals increases down the group.  碱金属的反应活性随着周期表族数的增加而增强。

The high reactivity of fluorine makes it dangerous to handle. 氟的高反应活性使其危险难以处理。|近义词：responsiveness, activity |反义词：inertness, stability
