/ˌoʊvərˈprɑːspərəsnəsəz/ | n. |过度繁荣的状态；极度富裕的状态 |The word "overprosperousnesses" is a rare and somewhat awkward-sounding word, formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to the already cumbersome "overprosperous."  It denotes multiple instances or aspects of excessive prosperity.  It suggests not merely wealth, but an excess to the point of being potentially problematic or unsustainable. The word emphasizes the plurality and potentially negative connotations of extreme wealth. |The overprosperousnesses of the 1920s ultimately led to the Great Depression.  = 20年代的过度繁荣最终导致了大萧条。 The multiple overprosperousnesses enjoyed by different sectors of the economy masked underlying vulnerabilities. = 经济不同部门享有的多种过度繁荣掩盖了潜在的弱点。 |extreme wealth, affluence, opulence, abundance |poverty, destitution, deprivation, scarcity |n.
