词源:
The word "cockade" comes from the French word "cocarde," which in turn likely originates from the Occitan word "coca," meaning "cock's comb" or "tuft."  The resemblance in shape between a cock's comb and the early forms of the decorative badge led to the adoption of the term.  The French word then entered English.
