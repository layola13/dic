词源:
The word "cattily" derives from the adjective "catty," which originally referred to a cat-like manner or disposition.  The modern usage emphasizes the negative aspects of this, such as spitefulness, slyness, and malice.  The connection likely stems from the perceived cunning and sometimes malicious behavior of cats.
