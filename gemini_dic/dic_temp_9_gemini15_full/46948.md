The word "daroo" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a word from another language, possibly a transliteration or a slang term.  Without knowing the language of origin, a complete analysis is impossible.  To provide an analysis, I need more context about where you encountered this word.  Please specify the language or dialect it comes from.
