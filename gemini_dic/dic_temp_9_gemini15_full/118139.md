They believed in building a broad socialist movement that would include a wide range of social classes.  Their name, derived from the Russian word меньшинство (men'shinstvo), meaning "minority," reflects their position as the smaller faction within the RSDLP.|The Mensheviks' focus on gradual reform ultimately led to their decline in influence and power as the Bolsheviks consolidated control after the October Revolution.|近义词:  (no direct synonym, but could be described as representing a "reformist socialist" perspective)|反义词: Bolsheviks|名词
