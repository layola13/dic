/ˌmɛtəˈfɪkʃən/ | n. |元小说，超小说| Fiction that refers to its own fictional status, drawing attention to its artificiality.  Metafiction often employs self-reflexivity and breaks the fourth wall, blurring the lines between fiction and reality.  It plays with the conventions of storytelling and invites the reader to question the nature of narrative itself. | Example:  The novel frequently interrupted its narrative with authorial asides, a hallmark of metafiction. 这部小说经常用作者的旁白打断叙事，这是元小说的一个标志。


Example:  The character looked directly at the reader and said, "You know this is just a story, right?", a clear example of metafictional technique.  这个人物直接看着读者说：“你知道这只是一个故事，对吧？”，这是元小说技巧的一个明显例子。
