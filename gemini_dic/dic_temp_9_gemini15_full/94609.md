词源:

The word "impregnably" comes from the Old French word "impregner," which means "to impregnate."  The prefix "im-" means "not," and the suffix "-bly" means "capable of being." Therefore, "impregnably" literally means "not capable of being impregnated" or penetrated.  The original sense of "impregnate" relating to filling something completely, evolved to include the sense of saturating or permeating, which then transitioned to the metaphorical sense of making something invulnerable or impenetrable.
