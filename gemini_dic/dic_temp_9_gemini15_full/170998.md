词源：

* **pseudo-**:  from Greek *pseudo-* meaning "false," "sham," or "pretended."
* **romantic**: from  French *romantique*, ultimately from *roman*, meaning "novel," related to the Roman language and culture.  The modern sense of "romantic" developed later, associated with idealized love and adventure.


The word combines the prefix "pseudo-" indicating something false or imitation, with "romantic," resulting in a word describing something that only appears romantic on the surface.
