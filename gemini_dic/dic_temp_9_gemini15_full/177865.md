词源:  The word "recertified" is formed from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "anew"), the verb "certify" (meaning "to attest to the truth or accuracy of something"), and the suffix "-ed" (indicating the past participle).  The root of "certify" comes from the Latin "certus" (certain) and "facere" (to make or do). Therefore, "recertified" literally means "made certain again."
