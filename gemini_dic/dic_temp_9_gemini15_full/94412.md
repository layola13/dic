The word "implicativeness" refers to the quality or state of being implicational;  the extent to which something implies or suggests something else that is not explicitly stated. It focuses on the capacity of a statement, action, or text to convey meaning indirectly, relying on inference and contextual understanding.  The greater the implicativeness, the more the receiver needs to infer meaning.

词源:

The word is derived from the adjective "implicative," which itself originates from the verb "imply."  "Imply" comes from the Old French "implier," meaning "to fold in, involve, or entangle," ultimately deriving from the Latin "implicare," with the same basic meaning. The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, indicating a quality or state.
