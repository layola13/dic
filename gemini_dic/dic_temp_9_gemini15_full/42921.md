covariant:/ˈkoʊveəriənt/| adj. |协变的，共变的 |Relating to covariance; changing together.  A covariant transformation is one in which the components of a vector or tensor transform in the same way as the basis vectors or tensors. In simpler terms, if the basis changes, the components of the object change proportionally.  This concept is crucial in various fields, including tensor calculus, differential geometry, and type theory. | Example: In general relativity, the metric tensor is a covariant tensor. = 在广义相对论中，度规张量是协变张量。The covariant derivative is a crucial concept in differential geometry. = 协变导数是微分几何中的一个重要概念。|近义词：concomitant, concurrent |反义词：contravariant
