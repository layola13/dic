The word "gench" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information according to the requested format.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a neologism:** It might be a newly coined word, a slang term, or specific to a particular dialect or community.  More context is needed.
* **It's from another language:** It could be a word from a different language.  If so, please specify the language.

Please provide more information so I can assist you accurately.
