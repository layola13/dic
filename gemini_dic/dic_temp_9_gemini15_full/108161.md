词源：

The word "latitudinarianism" derives from the adjective "latitudinarian," which itself comes from the Latin word "latitudo," meaning "width" or "breadth."  The original use referred to a group of 17th-century English clergymen who advocated for a broader interpretation of religious doctrine, allowing for more flexibility and less strict adherence to rigid rules.  The "–arian" suffix indicates a follower or adherent of a belief or system.  Over time, the term broadened to encompass a more general acceptance of diverse viewpoints and lifestyles.
