词源:

The word "overpromise" is a compound word formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "promise" (meaning "to make a declaration assuring a particular course of action").  Its usage reflects a modern trend of emphasizing the negative consequences of excessive promises.
