kame:/keɪm/| n. |冰碛丘|A kame is a mound or ridge of stratified sand and gravel deposited by glacial meltwater.  Kames are typically found in areas formerly covered by glaciers, often associated with other glacial landforms. They are formed when meltwater streams deposit sediment in crevasses or depressions in the glacier. As the glacier melts and retreats, the sediment remains, forming a kame. |例句：The hikers noticed a series of kames stretching across the valley floor. 登山者注意到山谷底部延伸着一系列冰碛丘。|例句：The kame was composed of layers of sand and gravel, evidence of its glacial origin.  这个冰碛丘由一层层的沙子和砾石组成，证明了它的冰川起源。|近义词：esker (though eskers are typically longer and more linear), glacial deposit |反义词：None specifically, but contrasts with features formed by processes other than glacial meltwater deposition.
