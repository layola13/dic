fodientia: /foʊdiˈɛnʃə/ | n. | 食虫动物 |  A fodientia is a term used in older taxonomic systems to refer to certain insectivorous mammals, primarily those that dig burrows.

The group traditionally included shrews, moles, and hedgehogs, but these are now understood to belong to different orders.  | 例句：The old classification system grouped fodientia with other burrowing mammals. = 旧的分类系统将食虫动物与其他穴居哺乳动物归为一类。 | 近义词：insectivore (but less specific) | 反义词：carnivore, herbivore


USAGE->

This word is almost exclusively used in historical biological contexts and doesn't lend itself to typical grammatical tense analysis like the example word "what".  Therefore, providing examples for grammatical tenses is not applicable.  The word is simply used as a noun.  


PHRASE->

There are no common phrases using "fodientia". The word is too specialized and outdated for common usage.
