resplicing:/riːˈspaɪsɪŋ/ | v. |重新拼接，重新剪辑 |The act of splicing something again, often referring to RNA or DNA sequences or film editing.  It implies a previous splicing event has occurred and is being modified or repeated. | Example:  The researchers performed resplicing of the pre-mRNA to study alternative splicing patterns.  研究人员对前mRNA进行了重新剪接以研究可变剪接模式。|近义词：re-editing, rejoining, reassembly |反义词：disassembly, separation
