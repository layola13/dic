carbonyl:/ˈkɑːrbənɪl/|/ˈkɑːbənɪl/| n. |羰基|A carbonyl group is a functional group composed of a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom: C=O.  It's a fundamental structural unit in many organic compounds, influencing their chemical properties and reactivity.  The carbonyl group is found in aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, esters, amides, and many other classes of organic molecules.|Example: The carbonyl group in acetone is responsible for its solubility in water. 丙酮中的羰基使其可溶于水。|近义词:oxo group|反义词:None.
