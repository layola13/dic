catelectrotonus: /ˌkætˌɪˌlɛkˈtroʊtənəs/ | n. | 负极电紧张 |  The decrease in excitability of a nerve or muscle fiber caused by the passage of a constant current through it, specifically at the cathode.  This is a physiological phenomenon where the application of a constant current to a nerve or muscle reduces its responsiveness to further stimulation near the cathode (negative electrode). | Example: The experiment demonstrated a clear catelectrotonus effect, reducing the nerve's ability to fire action potentials near the cathode. | 近义词:  cathodic polarization (less common in this specific context)| 反义词: anelectrotonus |
