词源:
The word "self-persuasion" is a compound word.  "Self" is an Old English word meaning "own" or "same," while "persuasion" comes from the Old French word "persuasion," ultimately deriving from the Latin "persuasio," meaning "the act of persuading."  Therefore, self-persuasion literally means the act of persuading oneself.
