词源:

The word "nonabstract" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "abstract."  "Abstract" comes from the Latin word "abstractus," the past participle of "abtrahere," meaning "to draw away" or "to detach."  Therefore, "nonabstract" literally means "not drawn away" or "not detached from reality," signifying something concrete and tangible.
