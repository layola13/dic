词源:
Rovings derives from the verb "rove," meaning to wander or travel without a fixed destination.  "Rov" is of uncertain etymology, possibly related to Old Norse or Old English roots suggesting movement or wandering.  The "-ing" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, indicating the action or state of roving.
