The word "disputacity" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (a newly coined word), a misspelling, or a word from a very specialized or fictional context.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need more context where you encountered this word.  Was it in a book, article, conversation, or somewhere else?  Knowing the source might help determine its intended meaning and allow for a more accurate analysis.
