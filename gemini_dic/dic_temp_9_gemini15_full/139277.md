用法说明:

The word "oblique" can be used to describe both physical things and abstract concepts.

Physically, it means not straight or perpendicular, but at an angle. For example, an oblique line is a slanted line.  An oblique angle is an angle that is not a right angle (90 degrees).

Abstractly, "oblique" describes something indirect, unclear, or not straightforward.  This is often used to describe language or behavior. For example, an oblique reference is an indirect or hinted-at reference. An oblique comment is a comment that is not directly stated. An oblique strategy is a strategy that is not directly tackling the issue at hand.

Note that there is no need for a detailed conjugation table for adjectives like "oblique", as they don't conjugate in the same way verbs do.  Adjectives like "oblique" simply modify nouns.
