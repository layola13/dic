词源:
The word "crewless" is a compound word formed by combining "crew" and the suffix "-less".  "Crew" originates from Old Norse *krū, meaning "a company, a crowd." The suffix "-less" is a common English suffix indicating "without" or "lacking".  Therefore, "crewless" literally means "without a crew."
