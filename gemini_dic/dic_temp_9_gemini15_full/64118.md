epsilons:/ˈɛpsɪlɒnz/ | n. |ε的复数形式，极小量，微小差异|The term refers to the plural of the Greek letter epsilon (ε), often used to represent a small quantity or a negligible difference.  In mathematics, it's frequently employed to denote a very small positive number. In other contexts, it can symbolize insignificant details or minor variations.|Example: The differences between the two datasets were mere epsilons.|近义词：infinitesimals, trivialities, minutiae|反义词：significant differences, major discrepancies|名词

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The epsilons are insignificant in this calculation. = 在这个计算中，ε值可以忽略不计。
These epsilons represent minor variations in the data. = 这些ε值代表数据中微小的变化。


一般过去时:
The epsilons were too small to be measured accurately. = ε值太小，无法精确测量。
The scientist dismissed the epsilons as experimental error. = 科学家将ε值视为实验误差而忽略。


现在完成时:
We have ignored the epsilons throughout the experiment. = 在整个实验过程中，我们忽略了ε值。
The researchers have found that the epsilons are consistent across all samples. = 研究人员发现，ε值在所有样本中都是一致的。


过去完成时:
They had already accounted for the epsilons in their previous analysis. = 他们之前的分析已经考虑到了ε值。
Before the final calculation, they had eliminated the epsilons. = 在最终计算之前，他们消除了ε值。


将来时:
The epsilons will be negligible in the final result. = ε值在最终结果中可以忽略不计。
We will consider the epsilons in our next iteration of the model. = 我们将在模型的下一轮迭代中考虑ε值。


虚拟语气:
If the epsilons were larger, the results would be significantly different. = 如果ε值更大，结果将大相径庭。
I wish the epsilons were easier to quantify. = 我希望ε值更容易量化。


被动语态:
The epsilons were considered insignificant by the reviewers. = ε值被审稿人认为微不足道。
The epsilons are being carefully analyzed in the current study. = ε值正在当前的研究中被仔细分析。


疑问句:
Are the epsilons within the acceptable range of error? = ε值是否在可接受的误差范围内？
How significant are these epsilons in the overall context? = 这些ε值在整体环境中的重要性如何？


否定句:
The epsilons are not large enough to affect the outcome. = ε值不足以影响结果。
The model does not account for the epsilons. = 该模型没有考虑ε值。
