词源：The word "dauntless" comes from the Old English word "dōn," meaning "to subdue" or "to overcome," with the negative prefix "un-" added, resulting in "undaunted." Over time, the "un-" evolved into "daunt-," and the suffix "-less" was added, resulting in its current form.  The evolution reflects a shift from meaning "not subdued" to "not capable of being subdued", hence "fearless".
