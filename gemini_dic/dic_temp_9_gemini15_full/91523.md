The word "{hyopastron}" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or etymological resources.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  A similar-sounding or looking word might exist.
2. **It's a neologism:** It could be a newly coined word, a technical term from a specific field, or a word from a fictional language.
3. **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name (person, place, or thing).
4. **It's from another language:** It might be a word from a different language that hasn't been anglicized.


Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you can.  With more information, I can attempt a proper analysis.  Without a valid word, I cannot provide the requested information (pronunciation, word class, definition, etc.).
