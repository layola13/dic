词源:
The word "overserviced" is a compound word formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") to the adjective "serviced" (meaning "provided with service").  "Serviced" itself comes from the verb "service," ultimately deriving from Old French *servise and Latin *servitium ("service").
