词源：

The word is a combination of "quasi" and "patronizingly".

* **quasi-**:  A prefix meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent."  It suggests something that resembles but is not entirely something else.

* **patronizingly**: An adverb derived from "patronizing," meaning to treat someone in a condescending manner, as if they are inferior.  This implies a sense of superiority and often a false or insincere kindness.


用法说明：

"Quasipatronizingly" describes a manner of speaking or behaving that has elements of condescension and assumed superiority, but not to the full extent of being overtly patronizing. It suggests a subtle, almost veiled attempt to belittle or imply inferiority.  The "quasi" prefix softens the harshness of "patronizingly," indicating that the behavior is only partially or seemingly patronizing.  The speaker or actor might be unaware of their patronizing tone, or they might be subtly attempting to maintain a sense of control or superiority in a less obvious way.
