词源:
The word "remodernized" is formed by combining the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "anew"), the adjective "modern" (meaning "relating to the present or recent times"), and the suffix "-ized" (indicating that something has been made or treated in a certain way).  Therefore, "remodernized" literally means "made modern again."
