phragmosiphon:/ˈfræɡmoʊsaɪfən/| n. |隔膜管,隔膜吸管| A phragmosiphon is a type of fossil organism, specifically a type of extinct cephalopod characterized by a septate (divided into chambers by septa) shell with a siphuncle (a tube running through the chambers).  These organisms are significant in paleontology for understanding the evolution of cephalopods and the environments they inhabited.| The phragmosiphon's complex shell structure is a key feature for its classification. | 近义词: (Lacking precise synonyms due to its specific paleontological nature) | 反义词: (Lacking precise antonyms due to its specific paleontological nature) |
