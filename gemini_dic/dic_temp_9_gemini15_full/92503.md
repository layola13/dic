词源:

The word "hypothesising" is derived from the noun "hypothesis," which comes from the Greek word "hupóthesis," meaning "a supposition."  "Hupóthesis" is composed of "hupó," meaning "under," and "thesis," meaning "a placing" or "proposition."  Thus, a hypothesis is literally something "placed under" consideration as a possible explanation.  The "-ising" suffix indicates the act or process of doing something.
