pseudokarst:/ˈsuːdoʊkɑːrst/| n. |假喀斯特，似喀斯特 |Pseudo-karst refers to landforms that resemble karst topography but are formed by processes other than the dissolution of soluble rocks.  These landforms often exhibit features similar to those found in true karst regions, such as caves, sinkholes, and underground drainage systems, but their origin lies in different geological mechanisms.  Examples include those formed by glacial activity, volcanism, or weathering of non-soluble rocks. |The researchers found evidence of pseudokarst features in the volcanic region.  研究人员在火山地区发现了假喀斯特地貌的证据。|karst,  solutional topography|non-karst,  non-solutional topography|名词
