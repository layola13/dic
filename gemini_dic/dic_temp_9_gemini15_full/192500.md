词源：

The word "scrupleless" is derived from the noun "scruple," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "scrupulus," meaning "a small sharp stone" or "a point of difficulty."  The metaphorical meaning of "scruple" as a feeling of doubt or hesitation about the morality of an action evolved over time.  Adding the prefix "un-" creates the antonym, "scrupleless," indicating a lack of such moral qualms.


用法说明：

Scrupleless is always used as an adjective.  It modifies a noun to describe someone or something that lacks moral principles or a sense of right and wrong.  It suggests a willingness to engage in immoral or unethical behavior without hesitation or remorse.  The word carries a strong negative connotation.
