singularities:/ˌsɪŋɡjʊˈlærətiz/| n. |奇点；单一性；独特性 |Points in spacetime where gravity becomes infinitely strong, and the laws of physics as we know them break down.  Singularities are often associated with black holes.  They can also refer to unique or exceptional instances or points. |例句：The singularity at the center of a black hole is a region of infinite density. 黑洞中心的奇点是一个无限密度的区域。
