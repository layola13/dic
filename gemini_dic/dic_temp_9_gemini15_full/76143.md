词源:

The word "fuse" comes from the Latin word "fundere," meaning "to pour" or "to melt."  This reflects the original use of fuses as a material that melts under excessive current, thus breaking the electrical circuit.  The meaning has expanded to include the broader sense of combining or blending things together.
