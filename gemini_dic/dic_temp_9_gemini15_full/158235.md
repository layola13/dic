英文解析:

Plausibleness is the quality of being plausible; seeming reasonable or probable.  It refers to the degree to which something appears believable or likely to be true.  The plural form, plausiblenesses, refers to multiple instances or aspects of plausibility,  highlighting different reasons or arguments that contribute to the overall impression of reasonableness.  It's a less frequently used word, typically employed when discussing multiple arguments or explanations that each possess a degree of plausibility, even if they might be contradictory or mutually exclusive.


例句：

The multiple plausiblenesses presented by the defense attorney complicated the case.  辩护律师提出的多种似是而非的理由使案件变得复杂。

Several plausiblenesses existed for the suspect's alibi, making it difficult for the police to determine the truth.  嫌疑人不在场证明存在几种似是而非的解释，这使得警方难以确定真相。
