Etymology:

The word "puritanicalnesses" is derived from "Puritanical," which in turn comes from "Puritan."  Puritans were a group of English Protestants in the 16th and 17th centuries who sought to purify the Church of England from what they perceived as Catholic influences.  The suffix "-ical" transforms the noun "Puritan" into an adjective meaning "characteristic of Puritans," and the suffix "-ness" further transforms it into a noun denoting the quality or state of being Puritanical. Finally, "-es" forms the plural.  Therefore, "puritanicalnesses" signifies multiple instances or aspects of the strict, austere, and morally rigid characteristics associated with Puritans.
