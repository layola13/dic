hematosis:/ˌhiːməˈtoʊsɪs/| n. |血液生成；血氧合|The process of oxygenation of the blood in the lungs.  It involves the uptake of oxygen from the alveoli into the red blood cells and the release of carbon dioxide.|例句：Efficient hematosis is crucial for delivering oxygen to the body's tissues.  高效的血氧合作用对于向身体组织输送氧气至关重要。|例句：Impaired hematosis can lead to hypoxia. 血氧合受损会导致缺氧。|近义词：oxygenation, aëration|反义词：deoxygenation|名词


USAGE->

过去完成时:
Before the surgery, the patient's hematosis had been severely compromised. = 手术前，患者的血氧合功能严重受损。
The researchers had already studied hematosis extensively before publishing their findings. = 研究人员在发表研究结果之前已经广泛研究了血氧合。


将来时:
Improved technology will allow for better monitoring of hematosis. = 改进的技术将允许更好地监测血氧合。
The new treatment will likely improve hematosis in patients. = 新疗法可能会改善患者的血氧合状况。


虚拟语气:
