nanoseconds:/ˈnænəʊˌsɛkəndz/ | n. |纳秒 | A nanosecond is one billionth of a second.  It's a unit of time used to measure extremely short durations, often in computing and electronics. | Example: The computer processed the data in just a few nanoseconds. 这台电脑在短短几纳秒内就处理了数据。|近义词:billionth of a second|反义词:millennia, eons


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The processor completes the task in several nanoseconds. = 处理器在几纳秒内完成任务。
How many nanoseconds does this process take? = 这个过程需要多少纳秒？


一般过去时:
The signal arrived in less than a nanosecond. = 信号在不到一纳秒的时间内到达。
The experiment measured the time in nanoseconds. = 实验以纳秒为单位测量时间。


现在完成时:
Scientists have measured events down to the nanosecond. = 科学家们已经将事件测量到了纳秒级别。
We have improved the system's speed by several nanoseconds. = 我们已经将系统的速度提高了几纳秒。


过去完成时:
Before the upgrade, the system had taken many nanoseconds to complete the task. = 升级之前，系统完成任务需要很多纳秒。
They had already calculated the time difference in nanoseconds. = 他们已经计算出纳秒级的时差。


将来时:
Future computers will operate in even faster nanosecond speeds. = 未来的计算机将以更快的纳秒速度运行。
The new technology will reduce processing time to under a nanosecond. = 新技术将使处理时间减少到不到一纳秒。


虚拟语气:
If the system were faster, it would operate in fewer nanoseconds. = 如果系统更快，它将在更少的纳秒内运行。
I wish the data transfer were instantaneous, not measured in nanoseconds. = 我希望数据传输是即时的，而不是以纳秒来衡量。


被动语态:
The time was measured in nanoseconds. = 时间以纳秒为单位测量。
The process is completed in a few nanoseconds. = 该过程在几纳秒内完成。


疑问句:
How many nanoseconds are there in a second? = 一秒钟有多少纳秒？
What is the time difference measured in nanoseconds? = 以纳秒为单位测量的时差是多少？


否定句:
The response time was not less than a nanosecond. = 响应时间不小于一纳秒。
It did not take only a few nanoseconds to complete the calculation. = 完成计算并不仅仅需要几纳秒。


PHRASE->
a few nanoseconds = 几纳秒
under a nanosecond = 少于一纳秒
several nanoseconds = 若干纳秒
in nanoseconds = 以纳秒为单位
order of nanoseconds = 纳秒级
