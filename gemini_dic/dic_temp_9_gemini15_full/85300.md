词源:
The word "harness" comes from the Old English word "hearnesse," meaning "equipment, gear, or armor."  This referred to the equipment used to control horses and other animals for work. The modern meaning of harnessing natural forces developed later, extending the idea of controlling and utilizing something powerful.
