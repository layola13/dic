词源:  The word is derived from the Latin "ingluvies," meaning "crop" (the expanded part of a bird's esophagus used for storing food). The meaning shifted to describe the quality of being excessively greedy because of the association with a bird's capacity to hold a large amount of food in its crop.  The association of a large crop with greediness is the basis for the semantic shift.
