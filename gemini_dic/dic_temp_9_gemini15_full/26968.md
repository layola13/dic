calcigenous:/ˌkælˈsɪdʒənəs/ | adj. |成岩的，由钙质形成的 | Formed from, or containing, calcium carbonate.  This adjective describes rocks or materials that originate from the precipitation or accumulation of calcium carbonate.  |Example: The calcigenous deposits in the cave system were impressive in their scale and formation.  洞穴系统中钙质沉积物的规模和形成令人印象深刻。|近义词：calcareous, limy |反义词：siliceous (硅质的)
