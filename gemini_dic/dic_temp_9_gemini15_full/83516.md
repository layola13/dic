The word "hadang" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  Please double-check your spelling.
* **A proper noun:**  It might be a place name, a person's name, or a brand name.
* **A word from a specific dialect or language:**  If it's from a non-English language, please specify the language.
* **A newly coined word or slang:**  If it's a very recent invention, it wouldn't be in dictionaries yet.
