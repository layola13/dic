词源:  The word "incivil" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "civil," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "civilis," meaning "of or relating to citizens, civic, or polite."  Thus, "incivil" literally means "not civil" or lacking in the qualities associated with good citizenship and polite social interaction.
