curie:/ˈkjʊəri/|/ˈkjuəri/| n. |居里（放射性活度单位）|A unit of radioactivity, originally defined as the quantity of a radioactive substance that undergoes 3.7 × 10<sup>10</sup> disintegrations per second.  It is named after Marie Curie, a pioneering researcher in radioactivity.|The sample had an activity of 10 curies.|近义词：becquerel (SI unit)|反义词：无


USAGE->
