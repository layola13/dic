The word "chiako" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  It's likely a proper noun, a name, or a word from another language.  To provide the requested information, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (e.g., a book, a website, a conversation)
* **What is the surrounding text or conversation?** This will help determine the word's meaning and usage.

If you can provide this context, I can attempt a more accurate analysis.
