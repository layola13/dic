protonema:/proʊˈtɔːnɪmə/| n. |原丝体|The protonema is the earliest stage in the life cycle of a moss or liverwort, consisting of a branched, filamentous structure. It develops from a germinating spore and gives rise to the gametophore, the mature, gamete-producing plant.  |Example: The protonema of this moss species exhibits a characteristically branched structure.  这个苔藓物种的原丝体呈现出特征性的分枝结构。|近义词：germinating spore (in early stages)|反义词：gametophore (mature stage)
