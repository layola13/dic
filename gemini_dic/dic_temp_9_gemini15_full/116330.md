词源:

The word "masterliness" is derived from the word "master," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "maistre," meaning "teacher," "master," or "craftsman."  The suffix "-liness" is an English suffix that forms nouns meaning "the quality or state of being," thus creating "masterliness" to mean "the quality or state of being masterful."  The evolution reflects the historical association between mastery of a skill and the role of a master craftsman or teacher.
