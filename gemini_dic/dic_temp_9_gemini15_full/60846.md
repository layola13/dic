electrotonous:/ɪˌlɛkˈtroʊtənəs/| adj.| 电紧张的；电紧张状态的 | Relating to or caused by electrotonus;  a state of altered electrical excitability in a nerve or muscle fiber due to the passage of an electric current.  This change in excitability can be either increased (catelectrotonus) or decreased (anelectrotonus) depending on the direction of the current. | Example: The experiment demonstrated the electrotonous effects of the applied current on the nerve fibers.  实验展示了施加电流对神经纤维的电紧张效应。|近义词：electrogenic, excitatory (in context)|反义词： (No direct antonym, but the opposite effects could be described as "decreased excitability" or "normal excitability")


WORD ORIGIN->
The word "electrotonus" is a combination of "electro-" (relating to electricity) and "-tonus" (referring to tension or tone).  The "-tonus" suffix is derived from Greek τόνος (tonos), meaning "tension."

USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a scientific context, particularly in neurophysiology and electrophysiology. It is not commonly used in everyday conversation.  Therefore, providing examples of its usage in various grammatical tenses is less practical. The examples below illustrate its use in scientific writing.


Example Sentence 1 (Simple Present): Electrotonus alters the membrane potential, affecting nerve impulse transmission. 电紧张改变膜电位，影响神经冲动的传递。

Example Sentence 2 (Passive Voice): The changes in membrane potential were attributed to electrotonus. 膜电位的变化归因于电紧张。

Example Sentence 3 (Past Tense):  Researchers observed electrotonus in the nerve cells following stimulation. 研究人员在刺激后观察到神经细胞的电紧张现象。

Example Sentence 4 (Present Perfect): Studies have shown that electrotonus plays a role in synaptic plasticity. 研究表明电紧张在突触可塑性中起作用。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "electrotonus." The term is used in its scientific context alone.
