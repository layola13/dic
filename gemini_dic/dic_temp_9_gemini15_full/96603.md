inductor:/ɪnˈdʌktər/ | n. | 电感器 | A passive electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it.  It consists of a coil of wire, often wound around a core material. Inductors are used in various circuits to filter signals, store energy, and create resonant circuits. | Example: The inductor in the circuit helps smooth out the fluctuating current.  这个电路中的电感器有助于平滑波动电流。 |近义词：coil, reactor | 反义词：capacitor

词源:

The word "inductor" comes from the verb "induce," meaning to cause (something) to happen or be created.  In the context of electricity, it refers to the induction of a magnetic field by an electric current flowing through a coil. The suffix "-tor" is added to create a noun indicating an agent or instrument.  Therefore, an inductor is a device that induces a magnetic field.
