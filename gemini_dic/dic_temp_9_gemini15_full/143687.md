词源:
The word "outlaying" comes from the prefix "out-" (meaning "outside" or "beyond") and the verb "to lay" (meaning "to place" or "to extend").  Therefore, "outlaying" literally means "placed outside" or "extending beyond." Over time, its meaning has evolved to refer to things that are situated on the outskirts or periphery, or to less important or secondary aspects of something.
