词源:

The word is a combination of:

* **inter-:**  A prefix meaning "between," "among," or "reciprocally."
* **percept-:**  Relating to perception (the ability to see, hear, or become aware of something through the senses).
* **-ual:**  An adjective suffix.

Therefore, "interperceptually" describes something happening *between* or *among* different aspects of *perception*.
