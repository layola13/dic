词源：

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," "almost," or "somewhat."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation.

* **reasonable**: From Old French *resnable*, ultimately from Latin *rationabilis*, meaning "capable of reasoning," "rational."


用法说明：

"Quasi-reasonable" is used to describe something that appears reasonable on the surface but lacks a firm logical foundation upon deeper examination. It often implies a degree of deception or manipulation, as the apparent reasonableness is misleading.  It's a more nuanced term than simply "unreasonable" because it acknowledges a semblance of reason, even if that reason is ultimately flawed.
