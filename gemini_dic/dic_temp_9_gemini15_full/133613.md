nonfluorescent:/ˌnɑːnfluˈɔːrəsənt/| adj. |不发荧光的|Not emitting or reflecting fluorescent light.  This term describes substances or materials that do not exhibit fluorescence.  Fluorescence is the emission of light by a substance that has absorbed light or other electromagnetic radiation.  Nonfluorescent materials absorb light without re-emitting it as visible light.|The poster board was nonfluorescent, preventing unwanted glare under UV light.  不发荧光的海报板防止紫外线照射下的眩光。|fluorescent, phosphorescent|opaque, absorbing
