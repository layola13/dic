WORD ORIGIN->
The word "inquietude" itself comes from the Old French "inquiétude,"  which combines the prefix "in-" (meaning "not" or "without") with "quietude," meaning "quietness" or "tranquility."  Therefore, "inquietude" literally means "lack of quietness" or "restlessness."  The "-'s" is the standard English possessive suffix, showing possession or relationship.
