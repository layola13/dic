词源:
The word "notarised" comes from the noun "notary," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "notarius," meaning "shorthand writer" or "secretary."  Notaries originally served as official record-keepers and witnesses, and their role evolved to include the authentication of documents.  The suffix "-ized" indicates the act of making something "notary."
