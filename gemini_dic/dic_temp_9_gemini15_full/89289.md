homoeomeria: /ˌhoʊmiəˈmɪəriə/ | n. | 同质性，均质性 |  The theory that all substances are composed of qualitatively identical, albeit differently arranged, minute particles.  This concept, prominent in ancient Greek philosophy, particularly associated with Anaximander, contrasted with the idea of substances being composed of fundamentally different elements. | Example:  Anaximander's concept of homoeomeria posited that everything is made of the same fundamental stuff, just arranged differently. =阿那克西曼德的同质性概念认为，一切都是由相同的基本物质构成的，只是排列方式不同。| 近义词：uniformity, homogeneity | 反义词：heterogeneity, diversity |  名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in philosophical and historical contexts discussing ancient Greek philosophy, particularly in relation to Anaximander and his cosmology.  Therefore, providing standard grammatical usages (present, past, future tenses, etc.) would be artificial and inappropriate.  The word itself is rarely used in modern scientific or everyday language.

PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "homoeomeria."  The term is primarily used as a standalone concept within the context of philosophical discussion.
