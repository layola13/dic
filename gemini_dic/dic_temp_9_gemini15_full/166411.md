prerespiration:/ˌpriːˌrɛspəˈreɪʃən/| n. |前期呼吸作用；预先呼吸|The process of gas exchange that occurs in plants before the onset of visible respiration.  It's a preparatory stage involving oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide release, often observed in seeds before germination or in dormant organs.  This process is distinct from the major respiratory process. |Example: The seeds exhibited prerespiration before germination, showing a slight increase in oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production.  种子在发芽前表现出前期呼吸作用，显示出氧气消耗和二氧化碳产生略微增加。|近义词:preliminary respiration, preparatory respiration |反义词:postrespiration
