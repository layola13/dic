panselectionist: /ˌpænˌsɛlˈɛkʃənɪst/ | n. |泛选择论者 |A panselectionist is someone who believes that natural selection is the primary driving force behind all evolutionary changes, even those that seem to be neutral or even slightly disadvantageous.  This perspective emphasizes the pervasive influence of selection across all levels of biological organization, from genes to ecosystems.  They often argue that seemingly non-adaptive traits can still be influenced by selection indirectly or through pleiotropic effects. | Example:  "The panselectionist argued that even seemingly random genetic drift is ultimately shaped by subtle selective pressures." | 近义词: selectionist (but with less emphasis on the pervasiveness of selection) | 反义词: neutralist (believes that many evolutionary changes are neutral and not driven by selection)
