词源：

The word "practicality" derives from the adjective "practical," which ultimately comes from the Middle English word "practicall," meaning "skilled in practice." This, in turn, stems from the Latin word "practicus," meaning "skilled, experienced." The suffix "-ity" is added to create the noun form, indicating a state or quality.
