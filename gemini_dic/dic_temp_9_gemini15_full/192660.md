scutibranchia: /ˌskjuːtɪˈbræŋkiə/ | n. |盾鳃类 | A subclass of gastropods characterized by a shield-like operculum and typically inhabiting shallow marine environments.  They are characterized by their gill structure and operculum (a hard plate that closes the shell opening).| Example:  Many scutibranchia species are found in intertidal zones.  许多盾鳃类物种都生活在潮间带。| 近义词:  (no close synonyms, as it's a specific subclass) | 反义词: (no direct antonyms)|  名词
