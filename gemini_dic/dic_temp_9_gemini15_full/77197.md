The word "gassier" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a word from a specific dialect or jargon, or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible without further context.  To provide a response similar to your requested format, I need clarification on the intended word or its source.
