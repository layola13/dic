词源:  Derived from the adjective "chatty," meaning talkative, which in turn comes from the verb "chat," meaning to talk in a friendly, informal way.  The suffix "-est" forms the superlative, indicating the highest degree of chattiness.  The ultimate origin of "chat" is uncertain, but it likely has connections to Old French or Middle English words related to informal conversation.
