corrosibility:/ˌkɔːroʊzəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 腐蚀性；可腐蚀性 | The susceptibility of a material to be corroded.  The degree to which a material is likely to be damaged by corrosion. | Example: The corrosibility of iron in seawater is high.  铁在海水中具有很高的腐蚀性。  The engineer tested the corrosibility of the new alloy. 工程师测试了新型合金的腐蚀性。 |近义词：susceptibility to corrosion, erosion rate | 反义词：corrosion resistance, incorrodibility |

词源:
The word "corrosibility" is derived from the verb "corrode," which comes from the Latin word "corrodere," meaning "to gnaw."  The suffix "-ibility" indicates capacity or capability.  Therefore, corrosibility signifies the capacity or capability of being corroded.
