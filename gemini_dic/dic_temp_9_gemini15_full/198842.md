词源:
The word "siderated" originates from the Latin word "sideratus," which means "star-struck" or "struck by a star."  This referred to the belief that celestial bodies could influence earthly events, causing things to be "blasted" or "smitten." Over time, the meaning broadened to include being struck with astonishment or fear.
