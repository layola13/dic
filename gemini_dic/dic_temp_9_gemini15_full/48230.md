deconstructor:/diːˈkənstrʌktər/| n. |解构者；解构函数|A deconstructor is a method in object-oriented programming that is automatically called when an object is destroyed.  It's used to release resources held by the object, such as memory or file handles, to prevent memory leaks and other problems. In literary theory, a deconstructor is someone who uses deconstruction to analyze texts.|Example: In C++, the deconstructor is called when an object goes out of scope or is explicitly deleted.  This ensures that dynamically allocated memory is freed.   In literary criticism, Jacques Derrida is considered a prominent deconstructor.|近义词：destructor (programming)|反义词：constructor (programming)

This word primarily functions as a noun in the context of programming and literary theory. Therefore, grammatical tense conjugations aren't applicable in the same way as with verbs.  The usage examples will focus on different contexts and applications.

Programming Context:

Example 1:  "The deconstructor for the `DatabaseConnection` object ensures that the database connection is properly closed before the object is destroyed." =  `DatabaseConnection`对象的析构函数确保在对象销毁之前正确关闭数据库连接。

Example 2: "Failing to implement a robust deconstructor can lead to memory leaks and system instability." = 没有实现强大的析构函数会导致内存泄漏和系统不稳定。


Literary Theory Context:

Example 1: "The critic acted as a deconstructor, unraveling the text's inherent contradictions and ambiguities." = 批评家扮演着解构者的角色，揭示了文本中固有的矛盾和歧义。
