nonhomologous:/ˌnɒnhoʊˈmɒləɡəs/| adj.| 非同源的 | Not homologous; not sharing a common ancestor or origin.  This term is often used in biology and genetics to describe structures, genes, or chromosomes that do not share a common evolutionary origin, even if they may have similar functions. | Example:  The wings of butterflies and birds are analogous structures, meaning they serve a similar purpose (flight), but they are nonhomologous because they evolved independently. 蝴蝶和鸟类的翅膀是类似的结构，这意味着它们具有相似的功能（飞行），但它们是非同源的，因为它们是独立进化而来的。|近义词：unrelated, dissimilar, different |反义词：homologous


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The structures are nonhomologous. = 这些结构是非同源的。
This gene is nonhomologous to that one. = 这个基因与那个基因非同源。

一般过去时:
The scientists determined that the genes were nonhomologous. = 科学家确定这些基因是非同源的。
The study showed the limbs to be nonhomologous. = 研究表明这些肢体是非同源的。

现在完成时:
Researchers have found many nonhomologous genes. = 研究人员已经发现了许多非同源基因。
We have confirmed that these structures are nonhomologous. = 我们已经证实这些结构是非同源的。

过去完成时:
They had already known that the proteins were nonhomologous. = 他们之前就已经知道这些蛋白质是非同源的。
Scientists had previously established that the organs were nonhomologous. = 科学家先前已确定这些器官是非同源的。

将来时:
Future studies will investigate nonhomologous traits. = 未来的研究将调查非同源性状。
We will determine if these sequences are nonhomologous. = 我们将确定这些序列是否是非同源的。

虚拟语气:
If these genes were nonhomologous, the results would differ. = 如果这些基因是非同源的，结果将会不同。
It would be surprising if these structures were nonhomologous. = 如果这些结构是非同源的，那将令人惊讶。

被动语态:
The nonhomologous nature of the chromosomes was established. = 染色体的非同源性得到了证实。
The genes were found to be nonhomologous. = 这些基因被发现是非同源的。

疑问句:
Are these genes nonhomologous? = 这些基因是非同源的吗？
Is this structure nonhomologous to its counterpart? = 这个结构与其对应的结构非同源吗？

否定句:
The proteins are not nonhomologous; they share a common ancestor. = 这些蛋白质并非非同源的；它们有共同的祖先。
The data suggests that these pathways are not nonhomologous. = 数据表明这些途径并非非同源的。


PHRASE->
