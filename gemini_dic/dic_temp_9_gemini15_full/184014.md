词源:
The word "reshufflement" is derived from the verb "reshuffle," which itself is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the verb "shuffle" (meaning to mix things up or rearrange them in a haphazard way).  The "-ment" suffix turns the verb into a noun, indicating the act or result of reshuffling.  The original meaning of "shuffle" relates to the act of moving one's feet while walking.  The figurative extension to rearranging items came later.
