USAGE->
This word is a possessive noun and does not conjugate through tenses.  It describes a state of being, not an action.  Therefore, typical tense examples are not applicable.  However, we can demonstrate its use in different sentence structures:


Declarative Sentence:
The detective's leeriness's were evident in his sharp questioning. =  侦探的猜疑在他的尖锐提问中显而易见。

Interrogative Sentence:
Were the witness's leeriness's justified? =  证人的猜疑是正当的吗？


PHRASE->

Since "leeriness's" is a possessive form,  phrase examples are limited and depend on what the "leeriness" belongs to.  Here are a few examples illustrating possible phrases:


a source of leeriness's = 猜疑的根源
the object of his leeriness's = 他猜疑的对象
free from leeriness's = 摆脱猜疑
increase of leeriness's = 猜疑的加剧
cause for leeriness's = 引起猜疑的原因


NOTE:  The word "leeriness" itself is not extremely common.  "Leeriness's" is even less frequently used, as it's a possessive form of a relatively uncommon word.  More common phrasing would involve using "suspicion" or "distrust" directly.
