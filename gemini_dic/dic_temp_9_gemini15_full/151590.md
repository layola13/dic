parthenogenic: /ˌpɑːrθənəˈdʒɛnɪk/ | adj. | 单性生殖的；孤雌生殖的 | Relating to or involving parthenogenesis.  Parthenogenesis is a type of asexual reproduction in which a female gamete or ovum develops into a new individual without fertilization.  | Example:  The species exhibits parthenogenic reproduction, meaning females can produce offspring without a male. = 这个物种表现出孤雌生殖，这意味着雌性可以在没有雄性的情况下产下后代。  | 近义词: asexual, virginal (in the context of reproduction) | 反义词: sexual
