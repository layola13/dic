manipulability: /məˌnɪpjʊləˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可操作性；易于操纵性；可控性 | The extent to which something can be easily manipulated or controlled.  It refers to the ease with which a system, object, or person can be influenced, controlled, or exploited. |例句：The high manipulability of the robotic arm allows for precise movements in complex tasks.  高可操作性的机械臂允许在复杂任务中进行精确的动作。

The software's manipulability is a key factor in its user-friendliness.  该软件的可操作性是其用户友好的关键因素。


近义词：controllability, malleability, tractability | 反义词：uncontrollability, inflexibility, resistance


词源:  Derived from the verb "manipulate," which comes from the Latin word "manus" (hand) and "plere" (to fill).  Originally meaning "to handle skillfully," it evolved to encompass the sense of skillful, often deceptive, control or influence.  The suffix "-ability" denotes the quality or state of being able to be manipulated.
