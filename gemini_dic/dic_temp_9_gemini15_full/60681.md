词源:
The word "electricals" is derived from the adjective "electrical," which in turn comes from "electricity."  The suffix "-als" forms a plural noun, indicating a collection of electrical items or components.  The origin of "electricity" traces back to the late 17th and early 18th centuries, ultimately stemming from the Greek word  ἤλεκτρον (elektron), meaning "amber," a substance that exhibits static electricity when rubbed.
