词源:  From Late Latin *factio ("a doing, making, fashioning; a making up, contriving"), from facere ("to do, make"). The original sense was of a "doing" or "making," which evolved to refer to a group of people acting together, often with a shared purpose or agenda. This sense further developed into the current meaning of a dissenting group within a larger body.
