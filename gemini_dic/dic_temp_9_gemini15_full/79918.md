The word "gnew" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure field.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer some educated guesses.
