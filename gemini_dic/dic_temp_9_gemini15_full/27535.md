camshaft:/ˈkæmʃɑːft/| n. |凸轮轴|A rotating shaft with lobes or cams that operate valves or other mechanisms in an engine or other machine.  It's a crucial component in internal combustion engines, controlling the opening and closing of valves that regulate the intake and exhaust of air and fuel. |例句：The worn camshaft was the cause of the engine's poor performance.  磨损的凸轮轴是发动机性能不佳的原因。

The car's engine problems were traced to a faulty camshaft. 汽车的发动机问题被追溯到一个有故障的凸轮轴。|近义词：valve actuator (部分功能)|反义词：无|词性：名词
