The word "outhomers" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a niche context (like slang or jargon).

To help, I need more context. Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the source will help determine its meaning and potential origins.  If it's a misspelling, providing the intended word would be helpful. If it's a neologism, providing the context of its use is essential to understanding its intended meaning.
