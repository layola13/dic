The word "hypervigilantness" is a combination of:

* **hyper-**:  A prefix meaning "over," "above," or "excessive."
* **vigilant**: Adjective meaning "alertly watchful and attentive to danger or trouble."
* **-ness**: A suffix forming nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.

Therefore, hypervigilantness literally means "the state or quality of being excessively watchful."  The root "vigilant" traces back to the Latin "vigilare," meaning "to keep awake," "to watch," or "to be watchful."
