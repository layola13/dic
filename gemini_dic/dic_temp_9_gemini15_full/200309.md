词源:
The word "skulduggery" likely originated in the 18th century.  Its precise etymology is uncertain, but it's generally believed to be a combination of "skull" and a word related to "dagger" or "dug". The "skull" element might suggest something hidden or sinister, while the "dagger" or "dug" element could imply underhandedness or digging up secrets.  The exact blend and evolution of these elements into the modern meaning remain somewhat obscure, reflecting the word's informal and expressive nature.  It's a playful, somewhat whimsical word, but one that powerfully conveys the sense of secret, dishonest activity.
