词源:

The word "distinction" comes from the Old French word "distinction," which itself derives from the Latin word "distinctio."  The Latin word is formed from the verb "distinguere," meaning "to distinguish," which is composed of "dis-" (apart) and "distinguere" (to mark).  Therefore, the root meaning points to the act of setting apart or making a difference.
