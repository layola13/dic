词源：

* **non-**:  prefix meaning "not"
* **reprehensible**:  from Latin "reprehendere" (to rebuke, reprimand), combining "re-" (back, again) and "prehendere" (to seize, grasp).  Thus, "reprehensible" means "deserving to be rebuked".


用法说明：

"Nonreprehensible" is used to describe actions, behavior, or character that is free from blame or criticism. It suggests a high standard of morality or propriety.  It's a relatively formal word and is often used in legal or formal contexts.  It is rarely used colloquially.
