The word "precipitateness" derives from the verb "precipitate," which comes from the Latin word "praecipitāre," meaning "to throw headlong," "to hurl down," or "to hasten."  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "precipitate" (meaning rash or hasty) into a noun, signifying the quality or state of being precipitate.
