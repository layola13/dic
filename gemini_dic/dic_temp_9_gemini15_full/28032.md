capacitor:/kəˈpæsɪtər/ | n. |电容器 |A capacitor is a passive two-terminal electrical component that stores electrical energy in an electric field.  It is used in electronic circuits for various purposes, including filtering, coupling, decoupling, energy storage, and timing. | Example: The capacitor in this circuit smooths the fluctuating DC voltage.  这个电路中的电容器使波动的直流电压平滑。|近义词：condenser |反义词：N/A

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The capacitor stores electrical energy. = 电容器储存电能。
This circuit uses a large capacitor. = 这个电路使用一个大的电容器。

一般过去时:
The engineer replaced the faulty capacitor. = 工程师更换了故障的电容器。
We tested the capacitor before installation. = 我们在安装前测试了电容器。

现在完成时:
The technician has repaired the damaged capacitor. = 技术人员已经修理了损坏的电容器。
They have installed a new capacitor in the power supply. = 他们已在电源中安装了一个新的电容器。

过去完成时:
The problem had been caused by a failed capacitor. = 问题是由一个失效的电容器引起的。
Before the experiment, we had checked all the capacitors. = 实验之前，我们检查了所有的电容器。

将来时:
We will install a new capacitor tomorrow. = 我们明天将安装一个新的电容器。
The company will replace all the old capacitors. = 公司将更换所有旧的电容器。

虚拟语气:
If we had a larger capacitor, the circuit would work better. = 如果我们有一个更大的电容器，电路将会工作得更好。
I wish I had known the capacitor was faulty earlier. = 我真希望我早点知道电容器坏了。

被动语态:
The capacitor was damaged during the test. = 电容器在测试期间损坏。
The faulty capacitor is being replaced. = 故障的电容器正在被更换。

疑问句:
What type of capacitor do we need? = 我们需要什么类型的电容器？
Is the capacitor charged? = 电容器充电了吗？

否定句:
The circuit doesn't have a capacitor. = 电路没有电容器。
He didn't use the correct capacitor. = 他没有使用正确的电容器。
