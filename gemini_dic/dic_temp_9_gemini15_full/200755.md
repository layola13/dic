The word "slent" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word not yet widely accepted.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis as requested.  To get a proper analysis, please provide the correct spelling of the word you intended.
