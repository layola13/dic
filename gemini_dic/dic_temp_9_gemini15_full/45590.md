词源：The word "currant" comes from the Old French word "corinthe," which itself derives from the Greek word "Korinthos," referring to Corinth, a city in ancient Greece known for its production of dried grapes.  Over time, the word evolved to specifically refer to the small, seedless berries, typically dried, that are now known as currants.
