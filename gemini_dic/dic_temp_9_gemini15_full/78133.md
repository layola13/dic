geometric-means:/ˌdʒiːəˈmɛtrɪk miːnz/| n. |几何平均数 |The geometric mean is a type of average that indicates the central tendency or typical value of a set of numbers by using the product of their values (as opposed to the arithmetic mean which uses their sum).  It is particularly useful for finding the average of percentages, rates of change, or ratios. |Example: The geometric mean of 2, 4, and 8 is calculated as the cube root of (2 * 4 * 8) = 4. |近义词：average (in some contexts)|反义词：N/A
