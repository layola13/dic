glacierization:/ˌɡleɪʃəriˈzeɪʃən/| n. |冰川作用，冰川化 |The process by which glaciers form and spread.  This involves the accumulation of snow, its transformation into ice, and the movement of the ice mass.  It significantly alters landscapes, carving valleys and depositing sediments.|例句：The glacierization of the valley created a unique ecosystem. 冰川作用塑造了这个独特的生态系统。

The extensive glacierization during the last ice age shaped the topography of the region. 上一次冰河时期大范围的冰川作用塑造了该地区的地形。|近义词：glaciation |反义词：deglaciation


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The glacierization process slowly reshapes the land. 冰川作用缓慢地重塑着土地。
Glacierization contributes to sea level changes. 冰川化促成了海平面的变化。


一般过去时:

将来时:
Climate change will likely accelerate glacierization in some regions. 气候变化可能会加速某些地区的冰川作用。
Future research will focus on the effects of glacierization on biodiversity. 未来的研究将集中在冰川作用对生物多样性的影响上。


虚拟语气:
If glacierization were to increase dramatically, sea levels would rise significantly. 如果冰川作用急剧增加，海平面将大幅上升。
It is unlikely that the region would have been shaped as it is without glacierization. 如果没有冰川作用，该地区不太可能被塑造为现在的样子。


被动语态:
