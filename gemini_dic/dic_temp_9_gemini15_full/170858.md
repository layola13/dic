pseudohalogen:/ˈsuːdoʊˌhæloʊdʒən/ | n. |拟卤素|A group of molecules or ions that resemble halogens in their chemical behavior, particularly in forming similar compounds.  They often contain a combination of non-metal atoms and exhibit properties analogous to those of halogens (fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine), such as forming salts with metals and exhibiting similar oxidation states. However, they lack the characteristic lone electron pair of halogens.  |Example: Cyanogen ((CN)2) is a classic example of a pseudohalogen; it behaves similarly to halogens in many chemical reactions.|近义词:halogen analog, halogen-like substance|反义词:halogen
