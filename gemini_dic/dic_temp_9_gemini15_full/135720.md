nonprimitive:/ˌnɒnˈprɪmɪtɪv/| adj. |非原始的；非基本类型的|Not primitive; not belonging to or characteristic of an early stage of development.  It often refers to data types in computer science that are not built-in or fundamental to the programming language. |Example:  "In some programming languages, strings are nonprimitive data types, meaning they are built from more basic elements."  "The nonprimitive tools required sophisticated skills to operate." |近义词:derived, secondary, complex, advanced |反义词:primitive, basic, fundamental

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The data structure is nonprimitive. = 数据结构是非原始的。
This software uses nonprimitive data types. = 这个软件使用非基本数据类型。

一般过去时:
The system used nonprimitive functions last year. = 去年系统使用了非基本函数。
The program relied on nonprimitive operations. = 程序依赖于非基本操作。


现在完成时:
They have implemented a nonprimitive sorting algorithm. = 他们已经实现了一种非原始的排序算法。
We have discovered that the data is nonprimitive. = 我们已经发现数据是非原始的。


过去完成时:
They had already defined nonprimitive operations before the project began. = 项目开始之前，他们已经定义了非原始操作。
The researchers had found the nonprimitive components problematic. = 研究人员发现非原始组件存在问题。


将来时:
We will use nonprimitive graphics in the next version. = 我们将在下一个版本中使用非原始图形。
The new system will support nonprimitive data structures. = 新系统将支持非原始数据结构。


虚拟语气:
If the data were nonprimitive, we would need a different approach. = 如果数据是非原始的，我们将需要不同的方法。
It would be helpful if the functions were nonprimitive. = 如果函数是非原始的，将会有所帮助。


被动语态:
Nonprimitive data types are used extensively in this application. = 此应用程序广泛使用非原始数据类型。
The problem was caused by nonprimitive operations. = 问题是由非原始操作引起的。


疑问句:
Is the data type nonprimitive? = 数据类型是非原始的吗？
Are these operations considered nonprimitive? = 这些操作被认为是非原始的吗？


否定句:
The data type is not nonprimitive; it is a basic type. = 数据类型不是非原始的；它是一种基本类型。
The functions are not nonprimitive; they are built-in. = 函数不是非原始的；它们是内置的。
