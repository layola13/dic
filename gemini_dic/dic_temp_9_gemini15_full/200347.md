The word "skur" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  Please double-check the spelling.
2. **A slang term or dialect word:** It might be used informally in a specific region or community. More context is needed to understand its meaning and usage.
3. **A neologism (newly coined word):**  It's possible the word is very recent and hasn't been widely adopted yet.


To help me provide the analysis you need, please provide more context.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (book, conversation, website, etc.)
* **What was the sentence or phrase in which it appeared?**
* **What is the general topic or subject matter?**

With more information, I might be able to determine the word's meaning, origin, and usage.
