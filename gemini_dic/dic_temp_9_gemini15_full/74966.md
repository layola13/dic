词源:  The word "fricandeau" comes from the French language.  Its etymology is ultimately uncertain, but it likely derives from a combination of "frire" (to fry) and "deau" (water), suggesting a dish prepared by frying and then braising or stewing in a liquid.  The modern usage, however, emphasizes braising over frying.
