词源:  The word "intraterritorial" is composed of three parts:

* **intra-**:  A prefix meaning "within" or "inside."  It comes from Latin *intra*.

* **territorial**:  Relating to territory or a territory.  This comes from "territory," which itself is derived from the Latin *territorium* (land).

* **-al**: A suffix forming adjectives, meaning "relating to" or "characteristic of."


用法说明:  "Intraterritorial" is primarily used in legal and political contexts to describe things that are confined to the boundaries of a specific country or state.  It contrasts with "extraterritorial," which refers to things that extend beyond a nation's borders.  It is generally less frequently used than its counterpart.  The word usually modifies a noun, such as "laws," "jurisdiction," or "operations."
