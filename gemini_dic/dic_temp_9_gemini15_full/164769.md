词源:

The word "preferentially" is derived from the adjective "preferential," which in turn comes from the verb "prefer."  "Prefer" originates from the Old French word "preferer," which itself comes from the Latin "praeferre," meaning "to carry or bring before."  The "-ial" suffix creates an adjective, and the "-ly" suffix transforms it into an adverb.  Therefore, "preferentially" literally means "in a manner of preferring."
