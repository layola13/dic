The word "proll" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no pronunciation, definition, etymology, or usage to provide.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please double-check the spelling.
2. **It's slang or dialect:**  The word might be used informally in a specific region or community.  More context is needed.
3. **It's a newly coined word:**  It's possible the word is very recent and hasn't made its way into dictionaries yet.  Again, more context is required.


To help me provide the information you need, please provide more context, such as:

* Where did you encounter this word?
* What was the surrounding text or conversation?
