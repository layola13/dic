hydrophobic:/ˌhaɪdrəˈfoʊbɪk/| adj.| 疏水的；憎水的 | Repelling, tending to repel, or not absorbing water.  Substances that are hydrophobic do not mix well with water. They tend to clump together instead of spreading out in water. This property is due to the chemical structure of the substance, which may be nonpolar or have a strong tendency to form intramolecular bonds rather than bonds with water molecules. | 例句：Oils are hydrophobic and will separate from water. 油是疏水的，会与水分离。

例句：Many plastics are hydrophobic, making them suitable for packaging food and beverages. 许多塑料是疏水的，这使得它们适合包装食品和饮料。


近义词：water-repellent, oleophilic, lipophilic

反义词：hydrophilic, lipophobic


词源：来自希腊语 *hydro- (水) + -phobic (害怕的)
