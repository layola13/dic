The word "lovery" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "lovely," "livery," or "lover."
2. **A neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.  Without more context, it's impossible to define.
3. **A proper noun:** A name or place name.


Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format. To receive a response, please provide the correct spelling or more context about where you encountered this word.
