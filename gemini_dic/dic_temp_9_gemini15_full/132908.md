The word "nonelevations" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a neologism (a newly coined word or expression) or a misspelling.  There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide a response in the requested format would be inaccurate and misleading.  

To help, if you could provide the context in which you encountered this word, I may be able to offer suggestions on its possible meaning or intended spelling.  It's possible it's a combination of "none" and "elevations," suggesting a lack of altitude or height, or perhaps a misspelling of a similar-sounding word.
