反义词：satirical, ironic, sarcastic, mocking, humorous


词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "satirical," which comes from the noun "satire" (from the Latin word "satura," meaning "a medley" or "mixed dish").  Satire itself implies the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices.  Therefore, "nonsatirical" signifies the absence of these satirical elements.
