galvanometer:/ɡælˈvænɒmɪtər/ | n. |检流计，电流计 | A galvanometer is a sensitive instrument used to detect and measure small electric currents.  It works by deflecting a needle or pointer in response to the current.  The deflection is typically proportional to the current strength. | The galvanometer showed a slight deflection, indicating a small current flow. 检流计显示轻微偏转，表明有微弱电流流动。 | ammeter, electrometer | voltmeter (for measuring larger currents) | 名词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The galvanometer measures the current accurately. = 检流计精确地测量电流。
This galvanometer detects even the smallest currents. = 这台检流计甚至可以检测到最微弱的电流。
