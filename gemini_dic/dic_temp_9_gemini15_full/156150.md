phototopographer: /ˌfoʊtoʊtəˈpɒɡrəfər/ | n. | 摄影地形学家 | A phototopographer is a specialist who creates maps and other geographic representations using aerial photographs or other imagery.  They utilize photogrammetry techniques to extract three-dimensional information from 2D images, producing detailed topographic maps, 3D models, and other geospatial data.  | Example: The phototopographer meticulously analyzed the aerial photographs to create a highly accurate topographic map of the mountainous region.  The phototopographer used advanced software to generate a 3D model of the archaeological site from drone imagery. | 近义词: photogrammetrist, cartographer, surveyor | 反义词:  (no direct antonym, but could be contrasted with someone who creates maps using solely ground-based surveying techniques)
