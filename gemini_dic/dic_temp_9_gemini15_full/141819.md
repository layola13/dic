orbitolites:/ˈɔːrbɪtəlaɪts/ | n. |轨道虫属 |Orbitolites are a genus of large, disc-shaped foraminifera found in shallow, tropical waters. They are characterized by their complex, concentrically arranged chambers.  Their fossils are common in many parts of the world. | Example:  The limestone was found to contain numerous fossils of orbitolites.  这块石灰岩被发现含有许多轨道虫属的化石。|近义词: foraminifera (a broader term) |反义词: N/A
