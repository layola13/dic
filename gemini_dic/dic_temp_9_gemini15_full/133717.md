词源:

The word "nonfrugal" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "frugal" (meaning "economical, sparing, or avoiding waste").  Therefore, "nonfrugal" literally means "not frugal."  The root of "frugal" traces back to the Latin word "frugi," meaning "fruitful, profitable, good."
