frankia:/ˈfræŋkiə/| n. |弗兰克氏菌属|A genus of nitrogen-fixing actinobacteria that form symbiotic relationships with the roots of certain plants, particularly alder trees.  These bacteria are crucial for the growth of their host plants in nitrogen-poor environments.|Example: Frankia species are important for the nitrogen cycle in many ecosystems.|近义词: Actinobacteria (broader term)|反义词: N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Frankia fixes nitrogen in alder roots. = 弗兰克氏菌固定桤木根部的氮。
The bacteria live symbiotically with the plants. = 细菌与植物共生。


一般过去时:
Scientists discovered Frankia in the 19th century. = 科学家在19世纪发现了弗兰克氏菌。
Researchers studied the symbiotic relationship between Frankia and alders. = 研究人员研究了弗兰克氏菌和桤木之间的共生关系。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified many species of Frankia. = 科学家已经鉴定了许多弗兰克氏菌物种。
Researchers have learned much about the nitrogen-fixing process of Frankia. = 研究人员已经了解了很多关于弗兰克氏菌固氮过程的知识。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery of Frankia, the nitrogen source for alders was unknown. = 在发现弗兰克氏菌之前，桤木的氮源是未知的。
They had already completed the genetic sequencing of several Frankia strains before publishing their findings. = 他们在发表研究结果之前已经完成了对几种弗兰克氏菌菌株的基因测序。


将来时:
Researchers will continue to study the genetics of Frankia. = 研究人员将继续研究弗兰克氏菌的遗传学。
Scientists will explore the potential of Frankia in biofertilizer production. = 科学家将探索弗兰克氏菌在生物肥料生产中的潜力。


虚拟语气:
If Frankia were absent, alder growth would be severely limited. = 如果没有弗兰克氏菌，桤木的生长将受到严重限制。
It is essential that researchers continue to study Frankia's role in nitrogen fixation. = 研究人员必须继续研究弗兰克氏菌在固氮中的作用。


被动语态:
Frankia is used in ecological restoration projects. = 弗兰克氏菌被用于生态恢复项目。
The nitrogen-fixing ability of Frankia is being exploited for sustainable agriculture. = 弗兰克氏菌的固氮能力正在被用于可持续农业。


疑问句:
What are the specific mechanisms of Frankia's nitrogen fixation? = 弗兰克氏菌固氮的具体机制是什么？
How many species of Frankia have been identified so far? = 到目前为止已经鉴定了多少种弗兰克氏菌？


否定句:
Frankia does not infect all plant species. = 弗兰克氏菌不会感染所有植物物种。
This particular strain of Frankia did not show nitrogen-fixing activity under laboratory conditions. = 在实验室条件下，这种特定的弗兰克氏菌菌株没有表现出固氮活性。


PHRASE->
Frankia symbiosis = 弗兰克氏菌共生
Frankia inoculation = 弗兰克氏菌接种
Frankia genetics = 弗兰克氏菌遗传学
Frankia species diversity = 弗兰克氏菌物种多样性
