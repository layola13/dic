词源:
The word "nonastringent" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "astringent."  "Astringent" comes from the Late Latin *astringere, meaning "to bind, draw together,"  ultimately from the Latin *ad- (to) + *stringere (to bind).  Astringents are substances that cause contraction of body tissues.
