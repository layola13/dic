The word "privativeness" is derived from the adjective "privative," which itself comes from the Latin word "privativus," meaning "deprived" or "lacking."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being privative.  The root traces back to the Latin verb "privare," meaning "to deprive."
