WORD ORIGIN->

The word "perjuriousnesses" is derived from:

* **perjury:** (n.) the act of swearing falsely or committing perjury.  This comes from Old French *perjurer*  and ultimately from Latin *perjūrus* meaning "one who has sworn falsely."

* **-ness:** (suffix)  This suffix is added to adjectives (in this case, an implied adjective form of "perjurious") to create a noun, denoting a state, quality, or condition.

* **-es:** (plural suffix) Indicates the plural form of the noun.


Therefore, "perjuriousnesses" describes the multiple occurrences or the overall condition of being filled with instances of perjury.
