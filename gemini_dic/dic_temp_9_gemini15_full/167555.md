prewarranted: /ˌpriːˈwɒrəntɪd/ | adj. | 预先担保的；事先保证的 |  Not a standard English word; it's a possible but uncommon neologism (newly coined word) formed by combining "pre-" (before) and "warranted" (guaranteed).  It suggests something is guaranteed or assured in advance.  There is no established dictionary definition or common usage.  Because it's not a standard word, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage is difficult and would be speculative.  To convey the intended meaning, it's better to use established words and phrases like "pre-approved," "guaranteed," "assured," or "pre-authorized."


例句： (Hypothetical examples, as the word is not standard)

The contract included a prewarranted clause for timely delivery. = 合同包含一项关于及时交付的预先担保条款。(This uses the word, but a more natural phrasing would be better)

His prewarranted success was surprising to many. = 他预先保证的成功让许多人感到惊讶。(This again uses the word, but is unnatural;  "His guaranteed success..." or "His assured success..." would be preferable.)
