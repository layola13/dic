melanconiales: /ˌmɛlənˌkoʊniˈeɪliːz/ | n. | 黑粉菌目 | Melanconiales is an order of fungi in the class Coelomycetes.  They are characterized by their asexual reproduction via conidia produced in acervuli, which are cushion-shaped, often erumpent structures.  Many species are plant pathogens, causing various diseases.  The order is currently considered obsolete by some mycologists due to phylogenetic analyses. | Example: Many species within the Melanconiales are known to cause significant damage to agricultural crops.  许多黑粉菌目的物种已知会对农作物造成重大损害。| 近义词: (taxonomic synonyms depending on classification system -  no direct synonyms as an order)| 反义词: (N/A -  not applicable for taxonomic rank)|  词性: n.


USAGE->
(This word is a taxonomic term and doesn't lend itself to typical grammatical tense usage.  The following examples demonstrate usage in scientific writing.)
