词源:

The word "indeficient" is formed by adding the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") to the word "deficient."  "Deficient" itself comes from the Latin word "deficiens," the present participle of "deficere," meaning "to fail" or "to be wanting."

While grammatically correct, it is less commonly used than its synonym "sufficient" or other words like "adequate" and "complete".  The word carries a slightly more formal tone.  It emphasizes the inadequacy of something rather than just stating its incompleteness.
