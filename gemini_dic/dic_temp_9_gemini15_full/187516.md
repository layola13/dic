词源:

The term "roly-poly" is a descriptive name, referring to the creature's ability to roll itself into a ball ("rolly") and its generally plump, rounded appearance ("poly," short for "polyp").  It's a compound word reflecting its behavior and shape.  There isn't a specific etymological history tracing back to ancient roots like some words, but rather it's a relatively modern, descriptive term.
