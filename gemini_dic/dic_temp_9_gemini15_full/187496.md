词源:
The word "rollicking" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "rolicken," meaning "to be merry and boisterous."  This, in turn, likely comes from a combination of the Old English words "hroclic" (meaning "noisy" or "boisterous") and a now lost word of Germanic origin, which contributed to the sense of lively movement. The "-ing" suffix is a common English participle ending, creating an adjective.
