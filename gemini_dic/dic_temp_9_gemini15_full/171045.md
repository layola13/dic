pseudotetramera: /ˌsuːdoʊˈtɛtrəmərə/ | n. | 假四聚体 |

英文解析:A pseudotetramer is a molecule or complex that appears to be a tetramer (a molecule composed of four subunits) based on its overall structure or behavior, but whose subunits are not directly bonded together in the same way as a true tetramer.  The subunits may be associated through weaker interactions or indirect connections.  The term often arises in the context of protein structures or other macromolecular assemblies.


例句:

The protein complex initially appeared as a tetramer in electron microscopy, but further analysis revealed it to be a pseudotetramer held together by non-covalent interactions. = 蛋白质复合物最初在电子显微镜下呈现为四聚体，但进一步分析表明它是由非共价相互作用结合在一起的假四聚体。


The observed quaternary structure resembles a tetramer, but the weak interactions suggest it's more accurately described as a pseudotetramer. = 观察到的四级结构类似于四聚体，但弱相互作用表明更准确的描述是假四聚体。
