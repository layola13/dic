词源:

The word "interdictor" comes from the verb "interdict," which itself derives from the Late Latin word *interdicere*, meaning "to forbid," "to prohibit," or "to interpose."  The prefix "inter-" means "between" or "among," and the root "-dicere" is related to the Latin word "dicere," meaning "to say" or "to speak." Thus, the original meaning implied a speaking or decreeing against something, leading to the sense of prohibition or stoppage.
