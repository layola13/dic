词源：
The word "precipitator" is derived from the verb "precipitate," meaning to cause a substance to separate from a solution or suspension, typically by a chemical reaction.  The suffix "-ator" indicates an agent or instrument that performs the action.  The root "precipitate" itself comes from the Latin word "praecipitare," meaning "to throw headlong" or "to hasten."
