词源:
The word "pupil" comes from the Latin word "pupilla," meaning "little doll" or "girl," a term referring to the reflection seen in the eye, which was thought to resemble a small person.  Over time, this term shifted to refer to the eye's aperture itself, and later, to the student under the tutelage of a teacher.
