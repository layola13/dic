词源:

The word "praiseless" is formed by adding the prefix "praise-" (meaning "praise") and the suffix "-less" (meaning "without" or "lacking").  Therefore, "praiseless" literally means "without praise."  Its etymology traces back to the Old English word "prāsian," meaning "to praise."


用法说明:

Praiseless is primarily used as an adjective to describe something or someone that deserves no praise or receives no praise.  It implies a negative assessment, highlighting the lack of merit or recognition.  It's less common than words like "unpraiseworthy" but carries a similar meaning, with perhaps a slightly stronger emphasis on the absence of praise rather than active disapproval.
