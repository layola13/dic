词源:  The word "glib" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "gliben," meaning "to glide," suggesting a smooth and effortless flow.  This is connected to the Old English word "glīdan," also meaning "to glide."  The sense of insincerity or superficiality associated with the modern meaning developed later.
