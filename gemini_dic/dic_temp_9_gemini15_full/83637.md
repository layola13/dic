High haemoglobin levels are often associated with certain diseases. = 高血红蛋白水平通常与某些疾病有关。

一般过去时:
The doctor checked the patient's haemoglobins. = 医生检查了病人的血红蛋白。
Her haemoglobin levels were low after the surgery. = 她手术后血红蛋白水平很低。

现在完成时:
Scientists have studied haemoglobins for many years. = 科学家们已经研究血红蛋白多年了。
The patient has shown improved haemoglobin levels since starting treatment. = 自从开始治疗以来，病人的血红蛋白水平有所改善。

过去完成时:
The researchers had already analyzed the haemoglobins before publishing their findings. = 研究人员在发表研究结果之前就已经分析了血红蛋白。
Before the blood test, she had never known her haemoglobin count. = 在验血之前，她从未知道自己的血红蛋白计数。

将来时:
The lab will test the haemoglobins tomorrow. = 实验室明天将检测血红蛋白。
We will monitor the patient's haemoglobin levels closely in the coming weeks. = 未来几周我们将密切监测病人的血红蛋白水平。


虚拟语气:
If the haemoglobins were damaged, oxygen transport would be impaired. = 如果血红蛋白受损，氧气运输就会受损。
It would be beneficial if we could increase the patient's haemoglobins. = 如果我们能提高病人的血红蛋白水平，那将是有益的。

被动语态:

疑问句:
What are the normal levels of haemoglobins in adults? = 成人的正常血红蛋白水平是多少？
Are the patient's haemoglobins within the healthy range? = 病人的血红蛋白是否在健康范围内？

否定句:
The patient did not have low haemoglobins. = 病人血红蛋白不低。
The test results showed that there were no abnormalities in the haemoglobins. = 测试结果显示血红蛋白没有异常。


PHRASE->
haemoglobin levels = 血红蛋白水平
low haemoglobins = 血红蛋白偏低
haemoglobin test = 血红蛋白测试
haemoglobin concentration = 血红蛋白浓度
abnormal haemoglobins = 异常血红蛋白


词源:
The word "haemoglobin" is derived from the Greek words "haima" (αἷμα), meaning "blood," and "globos" (γλωβος), meaning "globe" or "sphere," referring to the spherical shape of the red blood cells containing this protein.  The "ae" spelling is a common British English variation; "hemoglobin" is the more common American English spelling.
