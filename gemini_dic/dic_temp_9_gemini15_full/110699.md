linearization:/ˌlɪniəraɪˈzeɪʃən/| n. |线性化；线性化处理|The process of approximating a curve or function by a straight line or a set of straight line segments.  This is often done to simplify a complex problem or to make it easier to solve using linear methods. Linearization is frequently used in various fields, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science.  For example, it's used to analyze the stability of nonlinear systems by approximating the system's behavior near an equilibrium point with a linear model. |例句：The linearization of the nonlinear system allowed for a simpler stability analysis. 线性化非线性系统使得更简单的稳定性分析成为可能。


The linearization of the model simplified the calculations considerably. 模型的线性化大大简化了计算。|近义词：approximation, simplification|反义词：complication, nonlinearization|名词
