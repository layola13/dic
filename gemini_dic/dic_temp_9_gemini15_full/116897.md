词源:
The word "mayfly" comes from the Old English "mægflīege," a compound of "mæg" (meaning "magpie," possibly referring to their swarming behavior) and "flīege" (meaning "fly").  The connection to magpies is debated, but the "fly" component clearly indicates the insect nature of the creature.  The current spelling and meaning solidified over time.
