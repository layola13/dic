USAGE->
(Doziest is an adjective and doesn't have verb conjugations like "do".)  It describes a state of being, not an action.  Therefore, tense variations are irrelevant.


PHRASE->
(Since "doziest" is an adjective, it doesn't have common phrases in the same way a verb like "do" would.  Phrases using "doziest" would need to be context-dependent.)  For example:  "the doziest moment of the day," "his doziest grin," or "a doziest attempt."
