词源:
The word "quasi-expedient" is a compound word. "Quasi" is from Latin, meaning "as if," "seemingly," or "apparently."  "Expedient" comes from the Latin *expedire*, meaning "to extricate," "to free," or "to make easy."  Therefore, "quasi-expedient" describes something that *appears* to be a convenient or easy solution, but may not be so in the long run.
