macrophage:/ˈmækrəfeɪdʒ/| n. |巨噬细胞|A type of white blood cell that engulfs and digests cellular debris, foreign substances, microbes, cancer cells, and anything else that does not have the type I MHC (major histocompatibility complex) protein on its surface.  Macrophages are part of the innate immune system and play a critical role in both non-specific and specific immunity.|例句：Macrophages are essential for clearing away dead cells and debris after an injury. 巨噬细胞对于清除损伤后死亡的细胞和碎片至关重要。

例句：The macrophages in the lungs help defend against inhaled pathogens. 肺部的巨噬细胞有助于防御吸入的病原体。|近义词：phagocyte|反义词：N/A

词源:
The word "macrophage" is derived from the Greek words "makros" (μακρός), meaning "large," and "phagein" (φαγεῖν), meaning "to eat."  Therefore, a macrophage is literally a "large eater."
