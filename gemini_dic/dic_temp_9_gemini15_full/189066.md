The word "sabotka" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you intended a different word. Please double-check the spelling.
* **A word from another language:** It might be a word from a different language, possibly with a similar-sounding English equivalent.  If you can provide the language of origin, I may be able to assist.
* **A neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a slang term, or a word specific to a particular community or field.  More context is needed.

To provide the requested analysis, I need the correct spelling or additional information about the word's origin and context.
