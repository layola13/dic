The word "passado" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a word from another language, possibly Portuguese, where it means "past" or related to past tense.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis in the requested format for a non-existent English word.  If you meant a different word, or if you could specify the language of origin, I can try to help.
