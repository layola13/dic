The word "schenkbeer" does not exist in standard English or German.  It's likely a misspelling or a very regional, informal, or dialectal term.  There's no entry for it in major dictionaries.  To provide an analysis, I need a corrected spelling or more context about where you encountered this word.  If you can offer more information, I can give you a more accurate response.
