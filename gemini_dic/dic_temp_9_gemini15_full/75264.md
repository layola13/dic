词源:The word "frondeur" originates from the French word "fronde," meaning "sling" or "catapult."  Historically, the term was associated with the Fronde, a series of rebellions in 17th-century France against the absolute monarchy of Louis XIV.  The rebels used slingshots, hence the connection. The word's meaning evolved to encompass anyone who rebels against authority in a similar manner.
