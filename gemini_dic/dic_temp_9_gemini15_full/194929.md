词源:

The word "semi-intensive" is a compound word.  "Semi-" is a prefix derived from Latin *semi-, meaning "half" or "partly." "Intensive" comes from the Latin *intensīvus,  the past participle of *intendere, meaning "to stretch out, strain, or extend."  In agricultural context, "intensive" refers to high inputs of resources like labor, capital, and fertilizer per unit of land.  Therefore, "semi-intensive" describes a system that uses some, but not all, of these high inputs.
