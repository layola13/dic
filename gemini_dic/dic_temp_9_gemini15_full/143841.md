outpitied: /ˌaʊtˈpɪtiːd/ | adj. |  被过度同情；被怜悯过度 |  This word is not a standard English word. It's a non-standard formation, likely created by combining "out-" (meaning excessively or to a greater degree) and "pitied" (past participle of "pity"). It implies that someone has received more sympathy or compassion than is necessary or deserved.  There is no established dictionary definition or common usage.  |  Example:  He felt *outpitied* after his minor injury, as everyone treated him like a fragile invalid.  他因轻伤而感到过度同情，因为每个人都把他当作易碎的病人对待。 | 近义词: over-sympathized, excessively pitied | 反义词:  under-sympathized, ignored
