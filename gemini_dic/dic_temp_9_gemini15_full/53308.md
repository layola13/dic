词源:

The word "disable" comes from the Old French word "desabler," which means "to weaken" or "to enfeeble."  The prefix "dis-" indicates negation or reversal, while "-able" makes it an adjective or verb.  The modern meaning evolved to encompass the loss of function or capability, both physical and technological.
