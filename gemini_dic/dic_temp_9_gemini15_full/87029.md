词源:  The word "hepatitides" is the plural form of "hepatitis," which comes from the Greek words "hēpar" (ἧπαρ), meaning "liver," and "-itis," a suffix indicating inflammation.  Therefore, "hepatitis" literally means "inflammation of the liver."  The plural "hepatitides" indicates multiple types or instances of liver inflammation.
