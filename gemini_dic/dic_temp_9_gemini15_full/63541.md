词源:

The word "envelope" comes from the Old French word "enveloper," meaning "to wrap up" or "to cover."  This in turn derives from the prefix "en-" (meaning "in" or "into") and the verb "veloper," related to the Latin word "volvere," meaning "to roll" or "to wrap."  The original sense of the word thus reflected the act of wrapping something up. Over time, its meaning specialized to refer specifically to the paper container for letters.
