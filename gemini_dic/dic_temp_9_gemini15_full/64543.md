词源:
The word "errant" comes from the Old French word "errant," which means "wandering" or "straying." This, in turn, is derived from the Latin verb "errare," meaning "to wander" or "to err."  The noun form "errants" is a relatively rare usage, primarily used to refer to a group of people who are errant in their behavior or travels.
