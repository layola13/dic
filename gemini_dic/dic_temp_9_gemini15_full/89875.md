horopteric:/hɒˈrɒptərɪk/ | adj. | 视差的，视轴的 | Relating to the horopter, an imaginary surface in visual space on which all points appear single when viewed with both eyes.  It describes the geometrical relationship between the visual fields of both eyes. | The horopteric fusion of the two images creates a three-dimensional percept.  视差融合的两幅图像产生了一个三维知觉。|近义词：binocular (in the context of vision), stereoscopic | 反义词：monocular (in the context of vision)


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in the field of ophthalmology and visual perception research.  Therefore, examples showcasing its usage in everyday conversation are limited.  Instead, examples will illustrate its application within its specialized context.


一般现在时:
The experiment investigates how the horopteric correspondence changes with eye movements. = 实验调查了视轴对应如何随着眼球运动而变化。
The researcher analyzes the horopteric disparities in the patient's binocular vision. = 研究人员分析了患者双眼视觉中的视差差异。


一般过去时:
Studies showed that the horopteric surface is not always a plane. = 研究表明，视轴面并非总是平面。
The doctor measured the patient's horopteric range to assess their stereopsis. = 医生测量了病人的视轴范围以评估其立体视觉。


现在完成时:
Scientists have developed sophisticated models to predict the horopteric location. = 科学家们已经开发出复杂的模型来预测视轴的位置。
Researchers have found that horopteric discrepancies can contribute to binocular vision disorders. = 研究人员发现，视轴差异会导致双眼视觉障碍。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, the researchers had carefully calibrated the horopteric apparatus. = 在实验之前，研究人员仔细校准了视轴装置。
They had already determined the patient's horopteric curve before beginning the visual acuity test. = 在开始视力检查之前，他们已经确定了病人的视轴曲线。


将来时:

虚拟语气:
If the horopteric alignment were perfect, the patient would experience no double vision. = 如果视轴对准完美，病人就不会出现复视。
It would be beneficial if we had a more accurate model of the horopteric surface. = 如果我们有一个更精确的视轴表面模型，那将是有益的。


被动语态:
The horopteric measurements were taken using a specially designed device. = 视轴测量是使用专门设计的设备进行的。
The horopteric location is often influenced by various factors, such as accommodation. = 视轴位置经常受各种因素的影响，例如调节。


疑问句:
What factors influence the shape of the horopteric surface? = 哪些因素会影响视轴表面的形状？
How is the horopteric correspondence determined in the brain? = 大脑如何确定视轴对应关系？


否定句:
The patient did not show any significant deviations from the normal horopteric range. = 病人没有显示出与正常视轴范围有任何明显的偏差。
The study did not find a correlation between age and horopteric stability. = 该研究没有发现年龄与视轴稳定性之间存在相关性。
