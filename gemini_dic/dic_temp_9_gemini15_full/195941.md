sensitometer:/ˌsɛnsɪˈtɑːmɪtər/ | n. | 感光计 | A sensitometer is a device used to measure the sensitivity of photographic materials, such as film or paper, to light. It exposes a sample of the material to a series of precisely controlled light intensities, allowing for the determination of its characteristic curve (also known as an H&D curve).  This curve shows the relationship between exposure and resulting density, providing crucial information for optimizing photographic processes. | The photographer used a sensitometer to ensure the film was properly exposed.  | 近义词：exposure meter (部分功能重叠) | 反义词：无

过去完成时:
They had calibrated the sensitometer before beginning the experiment. = 他们在开始实验之前已经校准了感光计。
The photographer had already used the sensitometer to test the film. = 摄影师已经用感光计测试过胶卷了。

将来时:
We will use a sensitometer to check the film's sensitivity. = 我们将使用感光计来检查胶卷的灵敏度。
The lab will purchase a new sensitometer next month. = 实验室下个月将购买一台新的感光计。

虚拟语气:
If we had a sensitometer, we could test the film ourselves. = 如果我们有感光计，我们就能自己测试胶卷了。
I wish we had used a sensitometer before shooting the film. = 我真希望我们在拍摄胶卷之前使用了感光计。

被动语态:
The film was tested with a sensitometer. = 胶卷是用感光计测试的。
The sensitometer is being calibrated by the technician. = 感光计正在由技师进行校准。

疑问句:
Do you have a sensitometer in your lab? = 你们的实验室有感光计吗？
What type of sensitometer are you using? = 你正在使用哪种类型的感光计？

否定句:
We don't have a sensitometer at the moment. = 我们目前没有感光计。
The photographer didn't use a sensitometer for this shoot. = 摄影师这次拍摄没有使用感光计。
