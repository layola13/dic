词源:
The word "fudge" ultimately derives from a Middle English word meaning "to act clumsily or ineptly".  The sense of "to falsify" or "to evade" developed later, likely from the idea of clumsily manipulating or altering something.  The exact etymological path isn't completely clear, but the connection to clumsy or inept actions is the most likely origin.
