词源:  The word "jingoism" (and thus "jingoish") originated in the late 19th century. It's believed to derive from a popular music hall song of the time, "The Girl I Left Behind Me," which contained the line "We don't want to fight, but, by Jingo, if we do..."  "Jingo" in this context was a slang exclamation, possibly of uncertain origin but likely a variant of "jing," meaning "money" or "property" and thus implying a connection to patriotic fervor and national pride driven by economic interests. The term "jingoism" quickly became associated with aggressive patriotism and a readiness for war, and "jingoish" naturally followed as its adjectival form.
