词源:
The word "hard-boiledness" is derived from the adjective "hard-boiled," which originally referred to eggs cooked until the yolk is firm.  Figuratively, "hard-boiled" came to describe a person who is tough, cynical, and unemotional, similar to the texture of a hard-boiled egg.  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, indicating the state or quality of being hard-boiled.  The figurative use of "hard-boiled" gained popularity in the early 20th century, particularly in crime fiction, where it was often used to characterize tough detectives.
