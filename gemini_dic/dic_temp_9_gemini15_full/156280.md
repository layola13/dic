phyllomorphosis: /ˌfaɪləʊmɔːrˈfoʊsɪs/ | n. | 叶形发生；叶态发生 | The process of leaf development or transformation, often involving changes in shape, size, and structure.  It encompasses the entire sequence of events from the initiation of leaf primordia to the mature leaf form.  Studies in phyllomorphosis often involve analyzing genetic and environmental factors that influence leaf development. |  The study of phyllomorphosis revealed a significant correlation between leaf shape and environmental conditions.  |  leaf development, leaf metamorphosis |  (no direct antonym, but the opposite could be described as leaf degeneration or necrosis) | 名词
