nitride:/ˈnaɪtraɪd/| n. |氮化物|A nitride is a chemical compound consisting of nitrogen and at least one other element.  Nitrides are often formed by the reaction of a metal with nitrogen gas at high temperatures.  They exhibit a wide range of properties depending on the other element involved.  For example, some nitrides are hard and are used as abrasives, while others are semiconductors.|Example:  Gallium nitride (GaN) is a semiconductor used in LED lighting.  氮化镓（GaN）是一种用于LED照明的半导体。|近义词:  None directly comparable, but compounds with similar properties may include carbides or borides.|反义词: None directly opposite in meaning.|名词
