词源:
The name "loonie" is a playful reference to the bird depicted on the coin, the common loon (Gavia immer).  The name is a shortening of "loon," the common name for the bird.  It came into common usage in the 1980s shortly after the coin's introduction.

The slang meaning of "loonie" as a "fool" or "crazy person" is unrelated to the coin and predates the coin's existence.  This is a separate and older usage of the word.
