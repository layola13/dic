PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "nonremediably."  Its usage is typically standalone within a sentence describing a situation.

WORD ORIGIN->
The word "nonremediably" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), the verb "remedy" (meaning "to cure or correct"), and the suffix "-ably" (meaning "in a manner capable of").  Therefore, it literally means "not capable of being remedied."  The root "remedy" traces back to the Latin "remedium," a combination of "re-" (again) and "medium" (a means).
