词源:
The word "non-conformist" is a compound word.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "conformist" derives from the verb "conform," meaning "to comply with rules, standards, or laws."  "Conform" ultimately comes from the Old French "conformer" and Latin "conformāre," meaning "to shape, fashion."  Therefore, a non-conformist is someone who does *not* conform to established norms.
