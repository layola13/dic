词源:
The word "desirable" comes from the Old French word "desirable," which in turn derives from the Latin word "desiderabilis."  "Desiderabilis" is formed from the verb "desiderare," meaning "to long for," "to desire," or "to wish for."  The suffix "-able"  indicates something that is capable of being desired or that is worthy of being desired.
