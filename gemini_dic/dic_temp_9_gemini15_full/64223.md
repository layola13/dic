equimomental: /ˌiːkwɪˈməʊmən(t)əl/ | adj. | 等矩的，等动量的 |

英文解析：Having equal moments of inertia about all axes through a given point.  In simpler terms, it refers to a body or system where the distribution of mass is such that the moment of inertia is the same regardless of the axis of rotation through a specific point.  This property is important in mechanics and engineering.


例句：

The distribution of mass in the designed rotor was nearly equimomental, ensuring smooth operation at high speeds.  = 设计的转子中的质量分布几乎是等矩的，确保了高速运行的平稳性。

The calculation confirmed that the object was approximately equimomental around its center of mass. = 计算证实该物体在其质心周围近似等矩。


近义词：isodynamic (in the context of equal moments of inertia)


反义词：There isn't a direct antonym, but a body with significantly different moments of inertia about different axes would be the opposite concept.


词性：形容词
