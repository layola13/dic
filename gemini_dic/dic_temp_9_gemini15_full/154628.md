词源:

The word "persistent" comes from the Latin word "persistere," which is a compound of "per-" (meaning "through" or "thoroughly") and "sistere" (meaning "to stand" or "to remain").  Therefore, the original meaning implies "to stand firm" or "to remain steadfast."  The modern English adjective retains this sense of unwavering continuance.
