kilohertz:/ˈkɪloʊhɜːrts/ | n. | 千赫兹 | Kilohertz (kHz) is a unit of frequency equal to one thousand hertz (1000 Hz).  It is used to measure the frequency of sound waves, radio waves, and other oscillating phenomena. | The radio station broadcasts at 98.5 kilohertz.  无线电台以98.5千赫兹广播。 The computer's processor operates at 3.5 kilohertz.  计算机的处理器以3.5千赫兹运行。| megahertz, hertz |  (No direct antonym, as it's a unit of measurement) | 名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The radio station broadcasts at 98.5 kilohertz. = 无线电台以98.5千赫兹广播。
This signal oscillates at 10 kilohertz. = 此信号以10千赫兹振荡。


一般过去时:
The old computer operated at only 1 kilohertz. = 旧计算机仅以1千赫兹运行。
The frequency was measured at 2.5 kilohertz. = 频率测量为2.5千赫兹。


现在完成时:
Scientists have measured frequencies up to 100 kilohertz. = 科学家已经测量了高达100千赫兹的频率。
We have successfully transmitted data at 5 kilohertz. = 我们已经成功地以5千赫兹传输了数据。


过去完成时:
They had already established the communication at 10 kilohertz before the test began. = 他们在测试开始前就已经建立了10千赫兹的通信。
The engineer had calculated the frequency to be 5 kilohertz. = 工程师计算出的频率为5千赫兹。


将来时:
We will transmit the signal at 20 kilohertz tomorrow. = 我们明天将以20千赫兹传输信号。
The new system will operate at much higher kilohertz. = 新系统将以更高的千赫兹运行。


虚拟语气:
If the frequency were 10 kilohertz, the signal would be clearer. = 如果频率是10千赫兹，信号会更清晰。
I wish the device could operate at higher kilohertz. = 我希望该设备能够以更高的千赫兹运行。


被动语态:
The frequency was measured using a sophisticated instrument. = 频率是用精密仪器测量的。（可以理解为：频率被精密仪器测量）
The signal is transmitted at a frequency of 15 kilohertz. = 信号以15千赫兹的频率传输。（可以理解为：信号被以15千赫兹的频率传输）


疑问句:
What is the operating frequency in kilohertz? = 工作频率是多少千赫兹？
At what kilohertz does this device operate? = 此设备以多少千赫兹运行？


否定句:
The signal was not strong enough at 5 kilohertz. = 信号在5千赫兹时不够强。
This device does not operate below 1 kilohertz. = 此设备不低于1千赫兹运行。


PHRASE->
