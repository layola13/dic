词源:

From Latin *consuetudinem (nominative consuetudo), from consuescere "to accustom," from con- "together" + suēscere "to be accustomed," from suēs "custom."


用法说明:

Consuetude emphasizes the long-standing and ingrained nature of a practice, often implying it's deeply rooted in a culture or community. It suggests a habitual action or behavior that is widely accepted and followed over a considerable period.  Unlike "custom," which can refer to a more general practice, "consuetude" often carries a sense of formality and established precedent.  It's less frequently used in everyday conversation than its synonyms.
