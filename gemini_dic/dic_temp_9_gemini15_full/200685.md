词源:
The word "sleep" has its roots in the Old English word "slæp," which is of Proto-Germanic origin.  The Proto-Germanic ancestor is believed to be related to other words in Germanic languages describing a state of inactivity or rest.  The exact etymological path is complex and debated among linguists, but the core meaning of rest or inactivity has been consistently preserved through its evolution.
