paragneiss:/ˈpærəˌnaɪs/| n. |片麻状片岩|A paragneiss is a metamorphic rock that shows a banded texture and is formed from a sedimentary protolith (original rock). It is distinguished from orthogneiss, which is derived from igneous rocks.  Paragneisses often contain minerals like mica, quartz, feldspar, and garnet, reflecting their sedimentary origins. The banding is due to the alignment of minerals during metamorphism, creating a layered appearance.|The paragneiss samples showed clear evidence of regional metamorphism.  = 片麻状片岩样本显示了区域变质作用的明显证据。|gneiss, schist|orthogneiss|名词
