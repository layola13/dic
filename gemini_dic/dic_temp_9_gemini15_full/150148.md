pan-diatonicism:/ˌpænˌdaɪəˈtɒnɪsɪzəm/| n. |泛音阶性，泛七声音阶性 |The use of notes outside the diatonic scale in a musical composition, while still maintaining a strong sense of tonality.  It refers to a compositional approach that incorporates notes from outside the diatonic scale (the familiar seven-note scale of major and minor keys) but retains a clear tonal center.  This is achieved by carefully selecting and integrating these chromatic notes, ensuring they don't disrupt the overall harmonic structure. | Example:  Many composers of the Romantic period, such as Wagner, employed pan-diatonicism to create rich and expressive harmonies.  The use of passing tones and neighboring notes frequently contributes to pan-diatonic texture. | 近义词: chromaticism (but with a stronger emphasis on tonal stability) | 反义词: strictly diatonic music
