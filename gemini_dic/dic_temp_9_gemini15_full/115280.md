词源:  The etymology of "manky" is uncertain, but it's believed to be of British slang origin, possibly related to a dialectal variation of "mangy" (meaning affected with mange, a skin disease in animals).  The shift in meaning from a specific skin condition to a general state of dirtiness likely occurred through semantic broadening.  The word's first recorded use was in the mid-20th century.
