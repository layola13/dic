The suffix "-ism" denotes a doctrine, system, or practice.  Therefore, monetarism refers to the economic doctrine that emphasizes the role of money in the economy.

Monetarism is primarily used in economic discussions and writings. It is a noun referring to a specific school of economic thought.  It's not used in everyday conversation.
