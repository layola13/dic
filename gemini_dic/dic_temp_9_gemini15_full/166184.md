词源:  The word is a combination of "pre-" (meaning before) and "psychedelic." "Psychedelic" itself comes from the Greek words "psyche" (ψυχή), meaning "mind" or "soul," and "delos" (δηλος), meaning "manifest" or "visible."  Therefore, "psychedelic" literally means "mind-manifesting" or relating to experiences that alter perception and consciousness.  "Prepsychedelic" thus indicates a style or period that anticipates or foreshadows the full development of psychedelic art and music.
