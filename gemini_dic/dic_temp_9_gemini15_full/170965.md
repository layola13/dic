pseudopodial:/ˌsuːdəʊˈpoʊdiəl/ | n. |伪足；假足 |A temporary protrusion of cytoplasm that serves as an organ of locomotion or food acquisition in some protozoa and other unicellular organisms.  It's a temporary extension of the cell's cytoplasm, used for movement and feeding. |例句：Amoebas use pseudopodia to move and engulf food.变形虫用伪足运动和摄取食物。

例句：The white blood cells extended pseudopodia to capture the bacteria. 白细胞伸出伪足以捕获细菌。


近义词：false foot, cytoplasmic projection | 反义词： N/A


词性：名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Amoebas use pseudopodia for locomotion. = 变形虫利用伪足运动。
The cell extends its pseudopodia to engulf prey. = 细胞伸出伪足吞噬猎物。


一般过去时:
The amoeba used its pseudopodia to capture the algae. = 变形虫用它的伪足捕捉藻类。
The white blood cell extended a pseudopodium to surround the bacterium. = 白细胞伸出一个伪足包围细菌。


现在完成时:
The amoeba has used its pseudopodia to move across the slide. = 变形虫已经用它的伪足在载玻片上移动。
The immune cells have extended pseudopodia to trap the pathogens. = 免疫细胞已经伸出伪足来捕获病原体。


过去完成时:
The amoeba had already retracted its pseudopodia before I could observe them. = 在我能观察到它们之前，变形虫已经收回了它的伪足。
The phagocyte had extended its pseudopodia to engulf the debris before I took the image. = 在我拍摄图像之前，吞噬细胞已经伸出伪足吞噬碎片。


将来时:
The amoeba will extend its pseudopodia to find food. = 变形虫将伸出伪足寻找食物。
The cell will likely retract its pseudopodia once it has captured its prey. = 一旦捕获猎物，细胞可能会收回其伪足。


虚拟语气:
If the amoeba had more pseudopodia, it would move faster. = 如果变形虫有更多的伪足，它会动得更快。
I wish I could see the pseudopodia extending in real time. = 我希望我能实时看到伪足的延伸。


被动语态:
Pseudopodia are used by many single-celled organisms for movement. = 许多单细胞生物利用伪足运动。
The bacteria were engulfed by the pseudopodia of the phagocyte. = 细菌被吞噬细胞的伪足吞噬。


疑问句:
How many pseudopodia does this amoeba have? = 这个变形虫有多少伪足？
What triggers the extension of pseudopodia in this cell? = 什么触发了这个细胞中伪足的伸展？


否定句:
The amoeba did not extend its pseudopodia in response to the stimulus. = 变形虫没有响应刺激而伸出伪足。
The cell did not form pseudopodia under these conditions. = 在这些条件下，细胞没有形成伪足。


PHRASE->
formation of pseudopodia = 伪足的形成
extension of pseudopodia = 伪足的伸展
retraction of pseudopodia = 伪足的回缩
types of pseudopodia = 伪足的类型
pseudopodial movement = 伪足运动


词源:
From pseudo- + -podial.  "pseudo-" meaning false or resembling, and "-podial" from Greek "pous, podos" meaning foot.  Therefore, it literally means "false foot".
