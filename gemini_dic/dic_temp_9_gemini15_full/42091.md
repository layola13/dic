cotransductions:/ˌkoʊtrænzˈdʌkʃənz/| n. | 共同转导 | The simultaneous transfer of two or more genes from one bacterium to another by a bacteriophage. This occurs because the genes are located close together on the bacterial chromosome and are packaged together into the phage.  | Example: Studies of cotransductions have provided valuable insights into the organization of bacterial genomes.  共同转导的研究为细菌基因组的组织提供了宝贵的见解。|近义词:  linked transfer,  simultaneous transduction | 反义词:  independent transduction
