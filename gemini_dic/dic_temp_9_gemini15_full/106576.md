The word "kshatruya" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a misspelling or a word from another language, possibly Sanskrit.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis in the requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, more context is needed.  If you can provide the correct spelling and/or the language of origin, I can offer a more accurate analysis.
