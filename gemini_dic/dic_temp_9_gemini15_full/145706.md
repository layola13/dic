Etymology:

The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to a degree exceeding what is normal or necessary) and "courteousness" (politeness and good manners).  "Courteous" originates from the Old French "courtois," meaning "courtly," referring to the refined manners of the medieval court.  Ultimately, it traces back to the Latin "curia," meaning "court."
