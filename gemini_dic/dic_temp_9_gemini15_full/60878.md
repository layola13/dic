词源：

The word "element" comes from the Latin word "elementum," meaning "first principle," "rudiment," or "fundamental component."  The Latin word itself likely derives from the verb "elementa," meaning "to roll up" or "to arrange," suggesting the idea of basic components forming a whole.  The classical Greek concept of the four elements (earth, air, fire, and water) significantly influenced the development and understanding of the word "element" and its meaning.
