The word "hijera" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?

2. **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word from Spanish, Arabic, or another language.  If you can provide the language of origin, I can try to help with a translation and explanation.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a slang term, or a word specific to a certain community or subculture.  More context is needed.


To provide the requested analysis, I need the correct spelling or the language of origin.  Please provide more information.
