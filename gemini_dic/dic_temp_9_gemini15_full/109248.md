词源:

The word "leitmotif" is a German loanword, a combination of:

* **Leit-:**  German for "leading" or "guiding."
* **Motiv:** German for "motif" or "theme."  This itself comes from the French "motif," meaning "subject" or "theme."

Therefore, the literal translation is "leading motif" or "guiding theme," accurately reflecting its function in a work of art.
