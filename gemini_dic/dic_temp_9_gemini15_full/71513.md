词源:  The word "flannelette" is a blend of "flannel" and the diminutive suffix "-ette," indicating a smaller or less substantial version.  "Flannel" itself originates from Welsh *gwlanen, meaning "wool."  Therefore, flannelette originally implied a wool-like fabric, but now commonly refers to a cotton fabric.
