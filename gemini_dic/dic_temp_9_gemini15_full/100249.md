词源:
The word "interrupting" comes from the Latin word "interruptus," the past participle of "interrumpere," meaning "to break off," "to break in between."  "Inter" means "between" and "rumpere" means "to break."  Therefore, the word's etymology clearly reflects its meaning of breaking the continuity of something.
