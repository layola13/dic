词源:
re- (prefix indicating repetition or again) + articulate (from Latin articulatus, past participle of articulare "to furnish with joints," from articulus "joint," diminutive of artus "joint, limb").  The word's evolution reflects its dual meaning:  rejoining something (like joints) and re-expressing something (like an idea).
