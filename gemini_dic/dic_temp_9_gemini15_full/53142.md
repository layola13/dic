词源:  From Middle French *diplomatique, from Medieval Latin diplomaticus, from Greek diplomatikos "of or relating to a diploma", from diploma "a document, letter, or writing" (from diplo- "double," from dis "twice" + plegein "to fold").  The original sense referred to documents, especially official documents like treaties.  The modern meaning evolved from the use of such documents in international relations.
