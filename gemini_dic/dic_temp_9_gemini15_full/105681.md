词源:
The word "Kingsmen" is a compound word.  It combines "King," referring to a monarch, and "men," denoting male individuals.  Therefore, its literal meaning points to "men of the king," or those who serve or are loyal to a king. The modern usage, however, often refers to the fictional organization popularized by the film series.
