The word "iffinesses" is a relatively uncommon word, derived from the adjective "iffy".

**Etymology:**

The word "iffy" itself is a colloquialism, likely originating in the early to mid-20th century. Its etymology is not definitively traced to a single source, but it's generally understood to be a clipped or altered form of "if," expressing uncertainty or doubt.  The "-ness" suffix is added to create the noun form, and then the plural "iffinesses" denotes multiple instances of uncertainty or ambiguity.

**Usage:**

"Iffinesses" is used to refer to multiple instances or aspects of something that is uncertain, doubtful, or vague.  It highlights a collection of problematic uncertainties rather than a single instance.


**Examples:**

* The numerous iffinesses in the contract caused the negotiations to stall.  合同中大量的含糊之处导致谈判陷入僵局。

*  We need to address the iffinesses in the data before drawing any conclusions. 在得出任何结论之前，我们需要解决数据中的不确定性。


There are no specific grammatical tenses or voices associated with the use of "iffinesses" as it functions solely as a noun. The grammatical constructions surrounding it will vary depending on the sentence's purpose.


**Phrases:**

While "iffinesses" itself doesn't readily combine into common phrases, related terms like "iffy situation" or "a lot of iffiness" are frequently used.  Consider these examples:

*   They found themselves in an iffy situation. 他们发现自己处境不妙。
*   There's a lot of iffiness surrounding the project's funding.  项目的资金方面存在很多不确定性。
* The whole affair was full of iffiness. 整件事都充满了不确定性。
* We need to clear up the iffiness around the deadlines. 我们需要理清最后期限方面的不确定性。
*  The iffiness of the weather forecast made us reconsider our plans. 天气预报的不确定性使我们重新考虑了我们的计划。

Because it's a plural noun, "iffinesses" doesn't have common phrasal verb pairings like a verb would. Its usage is straightforward and descriptive.
