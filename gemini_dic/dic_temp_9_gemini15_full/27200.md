callose:/ˈkæləʊs/| n.|胼胝体；愈伤组织；纤维素；|A carbohydrate polymer deposited in cell walls of plants, particularly at sites of wounding or during the formation of abscission layers.  It is composed of β-1,3-glucans and is involved in sealing off damaged plant tissues.|The callose deposition in sieve plates helps regulate the flow of sap in plants.|近义词：callus (有时可互换使用，但callose更强调其化学组成)|反义词：无


USAGE->
