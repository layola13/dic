/ˈdʒaɪrɛnsɪˈfælə/| n. |脑回，多脑回| Gyrencephala refers to the condition of having a brain with numerous convolutions or gyri.  It is characteristic of the brains of most mammals, including humans, and contrasts with lissencephaly, where the brain surface is smooth.  The gyri and sulci (the grooves between the gyri) greatly increase the surface area of the brain, allowing for more complex cognitive functions.| The human brain is a classic example of gyrencephala, with its highly convoluted surface.| lissencephalic | lissencephaly | 名词
