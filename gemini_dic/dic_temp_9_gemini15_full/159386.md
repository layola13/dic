The word "pol's" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling, abbreviation, or a word specific to a certain dialect or context.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide helpful information, I need clarification on the intended word.  Is it a possible misspelling of another word?  Could you provide more context where you encountered this word?
