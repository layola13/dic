The word "chuse" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "choose," "chase," or "choosey."
* **A neologism:** A newly coined word not yet widely accepted.
* **A word from a dialect or specific jargon:**  It might be used within a particular community or field.


If you could provide more context (where you encountered this word), I can offer a more accurate analysis.  If you meant "choose," I can provide the analysis as requested in the format you provided.
