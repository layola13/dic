semicatalysts:/ˌsɛmiˈkætəlɪsts/| n. |半催化剂|A substance that enhances the rate of a chemical reaction but to a lesser extent than a true catalyst.  Semicatalysts may participate in the reaction mechanism but are not completely regenerated at the end of the reaction. They often show some degree of consumption or transformation during the catalytic process.|Example:  In some reactions, certain metal oxides act as semicatalysts, promoting the reaction but undergoing partial change themselves.  在一些反应中，某些金属氧化物充当半催化剂，促进反应但自身会发生部分变化。|近义词：promoter, accelerator|反义词：inhibitor, retardant|名词
