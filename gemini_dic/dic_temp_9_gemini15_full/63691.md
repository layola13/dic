epenthetic:/ˌɛpənˈθɛtɪk/| adj.|插入的；添字的|Added or inserted (sound or letter) in a word, often to ease pronunciation.  The term is often used in linguistics to describe sounds or letters that appear in a word but are not derived from its etymology. | Example: The 'p' in 'cupboard' is an epenthetic consonant.  This is because the word originated from Old English "cupbord," where the "p" is not present. | 近义词：inserted, interpolated | 反义词：deleted, omitted
