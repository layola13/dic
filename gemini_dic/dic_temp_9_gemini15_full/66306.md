Etymology:

The word "excrementitiousness" is derived from the Latin word "excrementum," meaning "excrement" or "waste matter."  The suffix "-itious" indicates "full of" or "characterized by," and the further suffix "-ness" denotes a state or quality. Therefore, the word literally means "the state or quality of being full of excrement."


USAGE->  (Note:  Due to the rarity and unusual nature of this word, providing typical grammatical usages across all tenses is impractical and unnatural. The word is primarily used as a noun, and its usage is generally limited to descriptive contexts.)


PHRASE-> (Again, due to the word's rarity, typical phrases are difficult to provide.  It's not typically used in phrasal constructions.)
