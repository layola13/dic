词源:  The word "shrewdest" is the superlative form of the adjective "shrewd," which ultimately derives from Old English *scrūdan, meaning "to cut, shear, or trim."  The meaning shifted over time, likely through the association of sharp cutting actions with sharp intelligence and cunning.  The association may also be connected to the meaning of "shrew" as a scolding woman, implying a sharp and clever tongue.
