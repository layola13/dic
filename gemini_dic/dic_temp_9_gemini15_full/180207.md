词源:  The word "refossion" is a relatively modern coinage, likely formed by combining the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") with "fossion," which is not a standard English word but may be a back-formation or alteration of a word relating to digging or cultivation.  The exact etymology requires further linguistic research, as it's not found in common etymological dictionaries.  It essentially implies the act of bringing land back into cultivation.
