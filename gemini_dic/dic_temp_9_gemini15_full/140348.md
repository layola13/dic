ohms:/oʊmz/ | n. |欧姆（电阻单位）|The ohm is the SI unit of electrical resistance, symbolized by the Greek letter omega (Ω).  It is defined as the resistance between two points of a conductor when a constant potential difference of one volt, applied to these points, produces a current of one ampere, the conductor not being the seat of any electromotive force.|例句：The resistor has a resistance of 10 ohms.  这个电阻器的电阻为10欧姆。

The circuit has a total resistance of 50 ohms.  电路的总电阻为50欧姆。|近义词：resistance (as a measure)|反义词：无


USAGE->
(Ohms is a noun, and doesn't conjugate like verbs.  The usage examples below show how it is used in sentences.)
