词源:
The word "investing" derives from the verb "invest," which comes from the Old French word "investir," meaning "to clothe," "to dress," or "to surround."  This older meaning evolved to encompass the idea of surrounding or endowing something with resources, eventually leading to its modern financial meaning.  The Latin root is "vestire," meaning "to clothe."
