词源:  The word "nonluminousness" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "luminousness," which itself derives from the adjective "luminous" (emitting light).  "Luminous" comes from the Latin word "luminosus," meaning "full of light," from "lumen," meaning "light."  Therefore, "nonluminousness" literally means "the state of not being luminous" or "the absence of light."
