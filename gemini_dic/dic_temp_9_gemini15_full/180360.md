词源:
The word "refurbished" comes from the verb "refurbish," which is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") and the verb "furnish" (meaning "to equip or supply with what is needed").  Therefore, "refurbish" literally means "to furnish again," implying a restoration or improvement to a previous state.  The addition of "-ed" creates the past participle and adjective form "refurbished".
