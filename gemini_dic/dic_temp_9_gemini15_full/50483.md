词源:  The word "depressively" is derived from the adjective "depressive," which in turn comes from the verb "depress."  "Depress" ultimately originates from the Latin word "deprimere," meaning "to press down," "to lower," or "to subdue."  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner or way in which something is done.
