词源: From "leucite" + "-itic," a suffix used to form adjectives denoting a characteristic or composition, often used in geology to describe rocks based on their mineral content.  "Leucite" itself derives from the Greek word  λευκός (leukos), meaning "white," referencing the mineral's typical white color.
