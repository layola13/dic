The word "portique" does not exist in standard English.  It's likely a misspelling or a word from another language.  If you could provide more context (e.g., the source where you encountered this word, the intended meaning), I can offer a more accurate analysis.  If it's a misspelling, please provide the correct spelling.

If it's a word from another language (perhaps French), please specify the language, and I will attempt to translate and explain it.
