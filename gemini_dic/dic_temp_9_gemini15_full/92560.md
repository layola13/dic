词源:
The word "hysterical" ultimately derives from the Greek word "hystera," meaning "womb."  Ancient Greek physicians believed that many female emotional disorders originated in the womb, leading to the association of "hysteria" with excessive emotionality. Over time, the term broadened to encompass uncontrolled emotional displays in both men and women.
