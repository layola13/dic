词源:
The word "slogger" is derived from the verb "to slog," meaning to work hard and persistently, often at a laborious task.  The verb "slog" itself has origins in the early 19th century, possibly from a dialectal word related to  "sluggard" (a lazy person) and implying a determined effort despite the slow and laborious nature of the work.
