词源:
The word "non-stoic" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "stoic," deriving from the Stoics, a school of Hellenistic philosophy emphasizing virtue, reason, and living in agreement with nature.  Therefore, "non-stoic" describes someone who lacks the characteristics of a Stoic.
