词源:The word "dowager" comes from the Old French word "dower," meaning "dowry," referring to the property a woman brought into her marriage. Over time, the term shifted to refer to a widow who retained her title and property after her husband's death.  The modern usage emphasizes the social standing and often the age of the woman.
