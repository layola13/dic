词源:

The word "nonchivalrous" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "chivalrous."  "Chivalrous" ultimately derives from the Old French word "chevalerie," meaning "knighthood" or "chivalry."  This, in turn, comes from "chevalier," meaning "knight" or "horseman," which is related to the word "cheval," meaning "horse."  Therefore, the core meaning traces back to the ideals and conduct expected of medieval knights.


用法说明:

"Nonchivalrous" is used to describe behavior or actions that lack the qualities traditionally associated with chivalry.  These qualities include:

* **Courtesy:**  Politeness and respectful manners.
* **Honor:**  Integrity and adherence to a strong moral code.
* **Bravery:**  Courage and willingness to face danger.
* **Gallantry:**  Chivalrous behavior towards women.
* **Generosity:**  Kindness and willingness to help others.


The word is typically used in a negative context to criticize someone's actions as lacking in grace, consideration, and respect.  It's often used to describe actions that are specifically rude or insensitive towards women, though it can apply to any situation where someone fails to display chivalrous behavior.
