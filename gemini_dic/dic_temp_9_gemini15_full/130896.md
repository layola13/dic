Word Origin:

The word "nonarticulateness" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "articulateness."  "Articulateness" derives from the adjective "articulate," which comes from the Latin word "articulatus," the past participle of "articulare," meaning "to join together," "to connect," or "to express clearly."  The sense of clear expression developed from the idea of joints in a body allowing for flexible movement and thus effective communication.

Usage Notes:

Nonarticulateness is primarily used as a noun describing a state or condition. It doesn't have verb or adjective forms of its own, but relies on the root word "articulate" for those functionalities.  The word is relatively formal and used in situations requiring precise description of communication difficulties.  It suggests a more profound inability to express oneself than simple shyness or nervousness.
