词源:

The word "inoffensiveness" is derived from the adjective "inoffensive" + the noun suffix "-ness".

"Inoffensive" comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") + "offensive".  "Offensive" ultimately stems from the Latin word "offendere," meaning "to strike against, to offend, to attack."  Therefore, "inoffensive" means "not offensive" or "harmless."  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix that transforms adjectives into nouns, denoting a state, quality, or condition.
