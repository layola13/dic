词源：

noisily is derived from the adjective "noisy," which in turn comes from the Old French word "noiseux," meaning "noisy."  The suffix "-ly" is an adverbial suffix, transforming the adjective into an adverb.  The ultimate origin traces back to the Latin word "nausea,"  originally referring to seasickness, but later evolving to encompass general unpleasant sounds.
