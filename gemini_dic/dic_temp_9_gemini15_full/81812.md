The word "gretas" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  There is no entry in major dictionaries.  It's likely a proper noun (perhaps a plural name), a misspelling, or a word from a niche context.  To provide the requested information, more context is needed.  For example:


* **Where did you encounter this word?** (e.g., a book, article, conversation)
* **What was the surrounding text?** This will help determine the intended meaning.

Once you provide this context, I can attempt to analyze it.
