joyancy: /ˈdʒɔɪənsi/ | n. |欢欣鼓舞；快乐；喜悦 |  The word "joyancy" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word.  It's likely formed by combining "joy" and "-ancy,"  a suffix suggesting a state or quality. Therefore, its meaning is inferred based on its component parts. It suggests a state of great joy and exuberance. | 例句：The joyancy of the festival was palpable. 节日的喜悦之情溢于言表。(This is an example using the invented word.)  | 近义词：joy, exuberance, exhilaration, glee, merriment | 反义词：sadness, despair, gloom, misery | 名词
