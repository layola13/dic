词源:

The word "enfranchising" comes from the Old French word "franchise," meaning "freedom," "liberty," or "privilege."  This in turn has roots in the Frankish word "frank," meaning "free."  The prefix "en-" is an Old English prefix meaning "to cause to be," "to make," or "to put into." Thus, "enfranchising" literally means "making free" or "granting freedom."
