词源:  The word "non-lucid" is a compound word.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of," derived from the Latin "non." "Lucid" comes from the Latin "lucidus," meaning "shining," "clear," or "bright."  Therefore, "non-lucid" literally means "not clear" or "not bright" in terms of mental clarity.
