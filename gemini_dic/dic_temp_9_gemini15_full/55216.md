词源:
The word "dissettle" is a combination of the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away from," "opposite of," or "not") and the verb "settle" (meaning "to become calm or stable," "to resolve," or "to establish residence").  Therefore, "dissettle" literally means "to unsettle" or "to make unstable."  Its usage reflects this etymological origin, focusing on the disruption of calmness or stability.
