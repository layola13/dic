词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "demonstrativeness," which derives from the verb "demonstrate."  "Demonstrate" ultimately comes from the Latin "demonstrare," meaning "to point out," "to show," or "to prove."  Therefore, "nondemonstrativeness" literally means "not showing or expressing."
