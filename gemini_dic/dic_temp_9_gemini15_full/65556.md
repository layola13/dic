eutizing: /ˈjuːtaɪzɪŋ/ | v. | 优共晶化；共晶处理 |  The process of forming a eutectic structure in a metal alloy by controlled cooling. This typically involves creating a fine, uniform dispersion of one phase within another, improving properties like strength and toughness. | Example: The steel was eutizing to enhance its wear resistance.  钢材经过优共晶化处理以增强其耐磨性。| 近义词: alloying, homogenizing | 反义词:  segregating (in the context of alloy formation)
