nonusance:/ˈnɒnjuːsəns/| n.|不用；不使用；废弃|The nonusance of the property led to its deterioration.  房产的不用导致其损坏。|近义词：disuse, nonemployment|反义词：usage, employment|


The word "nonusance" is not a standard or commonly used word in English. It's a relatively rare and obscure term.  While it's formed logically from "non-" (meaning "not") and "usance" (meaning "use" or "custom"), its meaning is inferred rather than explicitly defined in standard dictionaries.  The closest meaning is "lack of use" or "disuse."


Therefore, providing detailed grammatical examples as requested for a word with such limited practical usage is impractical.  The word's structure allows for potential grammatical applications consistent with a noun, but its lack of common usage makes illustrative sentences artificial and unhelpful.

To illustrate its *potential* usage grammatically, considering its meaning of "lack of use":

* **In a sentence:**  The prolonged nonusance of the equipment resulted in its obsolescence.  (长时间不用设备导致其过时。)


**Etymology:**

* **non-:**  A prefix meaning "not," "opposite of," or "absence of."  This prefix has roots in Latin.
* **usance:**  Derived from the Old French word "usance," ultimately from the Latin "usus," meaning "use," "custom," or "practice."


**Near Synonyms (with nuances):**

* **Disuse:** This is the closest and most common synonym.
* **Nonemployment:** This specifically refers to lack of use in a working or employed context.
* **Neglect:** This implies a failure to use something properly or to maintain it.
* **Abandonment:**  This implies a complete cessation of use and often a relinquishing of ownership or responsibility.


**Antonyms:**

* **Usage:** The most direct opposite, meaning the act of using something.
* **Employment:**  The opposite in the context of use in a working or employed context.
* **Utilization:**  Meaning the act of making practical and effective use of something.


Because "nonusance" is not a standard English word,  further grammatical examples (past tense, present perfect, etc.) would be contrived and not reflective of actual usage.  It's best understood and used in the context of its meaning: the state of being unused.
