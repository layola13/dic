词源:
The word "cheese" has its origins in the Proto-Germanic word *kāsiō, which ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *kāsi-.  This root is related to words in other Indo-European languages referring to fermentation and curdling processes involved in cheese making.  The English word "cheese" emerged through Old English  *cēse.  The evolution of the word reflects the long history and importance of cheese in human cultures.
