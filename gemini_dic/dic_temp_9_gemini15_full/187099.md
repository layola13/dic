The word "rivien" is not a word found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A proper noun:**  It might be a name (of a person, place, or thing), a brand name, or a neologism (newly coined word).
* **A word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language that hasn't yet entered common English usage.

If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to help you further.
