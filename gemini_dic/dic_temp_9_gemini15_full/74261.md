Therefore, a comprehensive analysis based on established linguistic resources is not possible.  Any definition and usage would be speculative.|Example:  (Hypothetical example showing potential usage)  His foxship was evident in his ability to manipulate the situation to his advantage.  他的狡猾在於他能將局勢操縱到對自己有利。|近义词: cunning, craftiness, guile, deception |反义词: honesty, straightforwardness, naivete
