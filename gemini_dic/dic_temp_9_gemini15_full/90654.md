Humanoid is primarily used as a noun.  It can refer to both real robots designed to resemble humans and fictional beings.

There is no verb form of "humanoid".  The adjective form is not commonly used, but could be used in sentences like "the humanoid features of the robot" (meaning the features that make it look human).
