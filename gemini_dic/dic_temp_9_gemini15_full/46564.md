词源:
The name "Dalmatian" derives from the Dalmatian Coast (now part of Croatia), where the breed originated.  While the exact origins are debated, the breed's history is long and possibly connected to ancient spotted dogs depicted in art. The breed's association with firehouses is a more recent development, popularized in part by the Disney film "101 Dalmatians".
