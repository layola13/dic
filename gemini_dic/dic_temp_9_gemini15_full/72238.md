florideae:/ˌflɔːrɪˈdiːiː/| n. |红藻纲|Florideae is a class of red algae characterized by their complex life cycles and the presence of specific pigments and structures.  They are mostly marine organisms found in various habitats, from shallow coastal waters to deep-sea environments.  This classification is now largely outdated and the organisms formerly classified within Florideae are now distributed across different orders within the Rhodophyta. | Example:  Many species within the former Florideae class exhibit a triphasic life cycle, including a gametophyte, a carposporophyte, and a tetrasporophyte stage.  许多曾经属于红藻纲的物种都表现出三相生命周期，包括配子体、果孢子体和四孢子体阶段。|近义词: Rhodophyta (red algae) |反义词: N/A
