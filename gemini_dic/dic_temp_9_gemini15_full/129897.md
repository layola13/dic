The word "non-irishes" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling. There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  The word seems to be attempting to create an antonym of "Irish," but the construction is grammatically incorrect and semantically unclear.  To properly analyze a word, it needs to be a recognized and established term within the English language.
