Etymology: The word "katana" comes from the Japanese word 刀 (katana), which itself is a shortened form of the older word 太刀 (tachi).  Tachi originally referred to a longer sword worn with the blade pointing downwards, while katana became associated with shorter swords worn with the blade pointing upwards. The evolution reflects changes in Japanese warfare and sword-wearing customs.  The word entered English via Japanese and is now widely used internationally.
