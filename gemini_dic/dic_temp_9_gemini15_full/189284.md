词源:

The word "sadism" is derived from the name of the Marquis de Sade (1740-1814), a French aristocrat and writer whose works frequently depicted graphic scenes of violence and sexual cruelty. His name became associated with the psychological condition characterized by deriving pleasure from inflicting pain on others.  The term was coined in the late 19th century.
