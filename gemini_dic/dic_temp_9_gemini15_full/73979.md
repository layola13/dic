词源:  The word "fortlet" is a diminutive of "fort," meaning a fortified place.  The suffix "-let" indicates smallness or diminutiveness, as seen in other words like "brooklet" (small brook) or "ringlet" (small ring).  Its origins trace back to the Old French "fort," ultimately deriving from the Latin "fortis," meaning "strong."
