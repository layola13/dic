heteroscedastic: /ˌhɛtərəʊskɛˈdæstɪk/ | adj. | 异方差的 |

英文解析:  In statistics, heteroscedasticity refers to the circumstance in which the variability of a variable is unequal across the range of values of a second variable that predicts it.  In simpler terms, it means the spread or dispersion of data points is not consistent across all levels of the independent variable.  For example, the variability in income might be much larger for high-income individuals than for low-income individuals.

例句:

The residuals showed clear evidence of heteroscedasticity, violating the assumptions of the linear regression model.  残差显示出明显的异方差性，违反了线性回归模型的假设。

The researchers addressed the heteroscedasticity by using weighted least squares regression. 研究人员通过使用加权最小二乘回归来解决异方差性问题。
