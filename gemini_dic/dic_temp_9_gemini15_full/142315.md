orthodoxastical:  /ˌɔːrθəˈdɒksɪkəl/ | adj. | 正统的；传统的；教条的 |  This word is not a standard English word. It's a non-standard combination of "orthodox" and "astical" (a non-existent suffix).  The intended meaning is likely to convey extreme adherence to orthodox beliefs or practices, perhaps to a rigid or excessive degree. However, its unusual nature makes it unsuitable for formal writing or conversation.  There is no established usage, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical examples.  Using "orthodox" alone would be sufficient and appropriate.


Because "orthodoxastical" is not a real word, I cannot provide the requested grammatical examples, synonyms, antonyms, or phrases.  The analysis below uses the word "orthodox" instead.
