词源:

The word "overdiscouragement" is a compound word.  It combines the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great degree) with the noun "discouragement," which comes from the verb "discourage" (dis- + courage).  "Dis-" is a negative prefix, and "courage" comes from the Old French word "corage" (heart).  Therefore, the root meaning traces back to a lack of heart or spirit.
