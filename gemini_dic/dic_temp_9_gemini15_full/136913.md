词源:

The word "nonsolidifying" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the present participle "solidifying" (from the verb "solidify").  "Solidify" comes from the Latin word "solidus" (solid) and the suffix "-ify" (meaning "to make").  Therefore, "nonsolidifying" literally means "not becoming solid".
