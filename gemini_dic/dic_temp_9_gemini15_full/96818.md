词源：

The word "inescapability" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the noun "escapability" (meaning "the ability to escape"), and the suffix "-ity" (forming nouns of quality or state).  Therefore, "inescapability" literally means "the state of not being able to escape."  "Escapability" itself derives from the verb "escape," ultimately from Old French *escaper and Latin *excappare.
