hydrobarometer:/ˌhaɪdroʊbəˈrɒmɪtər/| n. |水银气压计|A hydrobarometer is a type of barometer that uses the weight of a column of water to measure atmospheric pressure. Unlike a mercury barometer, it uses water, making it less accurate but safer.|The hydrobarometer showed a significant drop in atmospheric pressure, indicating an approaching storm.|近义词：barometer, manometer|反义词：None
