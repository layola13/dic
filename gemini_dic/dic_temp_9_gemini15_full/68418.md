The word "falsifiable" is derived from the verb "falsify," meaning "to prove to be false," which itself comes from the Latin word "falsus," meaning "false."  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or possibility.  The concept gained prominence in the philosophy of science through the work of Karl Popper.
