词源:

The word "full-scale" is a compound adjective.  "Full" means complete or entire. "Scale" in this context refers to the extent or magnitude of something.  The combination indicates something that is complete in its scope and size.  The origin of "full" traces back to Old English *full, while "scale" has roots in Old North French *escale and ultimately Latin *scala ("ladder," "steps").  The use of "scale" to represent size or extent developed over time.
