词源:
The word "lackey" originates from the Old French word "laquais," which referred to a footman or liveried servant.  This, in turn, is thought to be derived from a regional French word related to "lac" (lake), possibly referencing a servant who carried water or performed similar tasks near a lake or body of water.  The semantic shift from "footman" to "subservient follower" developed over time.
