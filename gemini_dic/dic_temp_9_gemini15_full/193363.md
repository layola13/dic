词源：

The word "segregationist" is derived from the verb "segregate," which itself comes from the Latin word "segregare," meaning "to separate," "to set apart," or "to keep apart."  The suffix "-ist" signifies a person who believes in or practices a particular thing or ideology.  Therefore, a segregationist is someone who believes in and supports the practice of segregation.
