词源:

The word "cracker" originates from the Old French word "craquer," meaning "to crack" or "to break."  Its application to biscuits comes from the sound they make when being bitten into. The association with firecrackers also derives from the sound of exploding fireworks.  The slang usage referring to a boastful person is a later development, likely linked to the idea of something loud and attention-grabbing.
