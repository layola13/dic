The word "prediverts" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word), a misspelling, or a word specific to a niche field.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage description are impossible.  To provide a response that follows the requested format, I will need a correctly spelled word or clarification on its intended meaning.
