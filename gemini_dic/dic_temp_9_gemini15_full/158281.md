词源:
The word "playbill" is a compound word formed from "play" and "bill."  "Play" refers to a theatrical performance, and "bill" originally meant a written or printed notice or advertisement.  Therefore, a playbill is literally a "bill" or advertisement for a "play." The word's usage developed naturally from its component parts.
