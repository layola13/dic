The word "schlocker" is derived from "schlock," which is a Yiddish word meaning "junk" or "trash."  The suffix "-er" transforms it into a noun denoting a person or thing associated with schlock.  Therefore, a "schlocker" is someone who creates or is involved in producing schlock, often applied to low-budget filmmakers and their productions.
