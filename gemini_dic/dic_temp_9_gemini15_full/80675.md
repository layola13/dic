The word "gorfly" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), slang, or specific to a very niche dialect or community.  To provide the requested analysis, I would need more context on where you encountered this word.
