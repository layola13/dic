英文解析:The word "pentastichous" is derived from the Greek words "pente" (five) and "stichos" (row, line, or verse).  It describes a pattern where elements, such as leaves, petals, or other plant structures, are arranged in five distinct rows or whorls around a central axis.  It's a relatively specialized term used mainly in botanical descriptions.
