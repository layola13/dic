词源:
The term is an acronym formed from the initial letters of the words identifying different sexual orientations and gender identities:

* **L**esbian:  A woman who is primarily attracted to other women.
* **G**ay:  A person who is primarily attracted to people of the same sex (can refer to men or women, but historically used more for men).
* **B**isexual: A person who is attracted to people of more than one gender.
* **T**ransgender:  A person whose gender identity differs from the sex assigned at birth.
* **Q**ueer:  An umbrella term encompassing a wide range of sexual orientations and gender identities; it also has a controversial history due to its past pejorative use, but has been reclaimed by many in the community.

The "+" is added to represent the many other identities and sexual orientations that are not explicitly listed within the acronym.  The acronym itself has evolved over time, adding letters to represent more identities as the understanding and recognition of diversity has grown.
