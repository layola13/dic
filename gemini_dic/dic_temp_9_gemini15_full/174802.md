词源:

The word "racecourse" is a compound word.  "Race" comes from Old French "race," meaning "course,"  "speed," or "running," ultimately from Latin "currere" (to run). "Course" comes from Old French "course," meaning "running," or "a race," also ultimately from Latin "currere".  Therefore, "racecourse" literally means "a running course" or "a course for racing".
