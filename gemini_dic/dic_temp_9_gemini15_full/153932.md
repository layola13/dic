词源:  From Late Latin *peregrinator, from Latin peregrinari "to travel abroad, journey," from peregrinus "foreigner, stranger," from per "through" + ager "field."  The original sense implied traveling through fields, hence outside one's own area.


用法说明:

The word "peregrinator" is relatively uncommon in modern English, though it is perfectly understandable.  It carries a more literary and evocative connotation than "traveler" or "wanderer," suggesting a more purposeful and extensive journey, perhaps with a sense of exploration or pilgrimage.  It emphasizes the act of traveling itself, rather than the destination.
