词源:
The word "chivalrousnesses" is derived from the noun "chivalry," which ultimately traces back to the Old French word "chevalerie," meaning "horsemanship," "knighthood," or "knightly service."  Over time, "chivalry" came to encompass the broader ideals of courtesy, honor, courage, and gallantry associated with medieval knights.  The suffix "-nesses" is a pluralizing suffix indicating multiple instances or qualities.
