词源:

The word "predisguising" is formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") with the verb "disguising" (meaning to conceal or alter one's appearance or identity).  Therefore, it literally means "to disguise beforehand." There isn't a separate, ancient etymology for the word as a whole, as it's a relatively modern combination of existing morphemes.
