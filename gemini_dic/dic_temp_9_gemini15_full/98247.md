insensors: /ɪnˈsɛnsərz/ | n. | 传感器（复数）|  A device that detects and responds to some type of input from the physical environment.  Insensors are used in a wide variety of applications, from monitoring environmental conditions to controlling industrial processes. | Example: The robot uses insensors to navigate its surroundings.  这个机器人使用传感器来导航周围环境。|近义词: sensors, detectors | 反义词: N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The insensors monitor temperature and humidity. = 传感器监测温度和湿度。
These insensors detect changes in pressure. = 这些传感器检测压力变化。


一般过去时:
The insensors recorded a sudden spike in temperature. = 传感器记录到温度突然飙升。
The old insensors failed to detect the leak. = 旧的传感器未能检测到泄漏。


现在完成时:
The insensors have consistently provided accurate data. = 传感器一直提供准确的数据。
The system has integrated new insensors for improved performance. = 系统集成了新的传感器以提高性能。


过去完成时:
The insensors had already detected the problem before the alarm sounded. = 警报响起前，传感器就已经检测到问题了。
