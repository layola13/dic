The word "rodes" does not exist as a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please double-check your spelling.  Perhaps you meant "roads," "rode," or another word entirely.

2. **A proper noun:** It could be a surname or place name, but without more context, it's impossible to determine its meaning or origin.

3. **A neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.  If this is the case, please provide more context.


Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format, as the word "rodes" lacks a standard definition and usage.  Please clarify the word you intend to analyze.
