词源:
The word "miry" comes from the Middle English word "miry," which in turn derives from the Old English word "myre," meaning "swamp" or "bog."  The Old English word is related to the Proto-Germanic word "*meþuz," which also had a meaning related to wet, marshy ground.  Therefore, the word's roots are deeply connected to the imagery of wet, muddy, and difficult terrain.
