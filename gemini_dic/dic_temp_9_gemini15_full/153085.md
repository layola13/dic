词源:

The word "peevishly" derives from the adjective "peevish," which ultimately traces back to the Middle English word "pevis," meaning "childish," "silly," or "foolish."  This, in turn, likely originates from a now-obsolete word with a similar meaning. The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner in which an action is performed.
