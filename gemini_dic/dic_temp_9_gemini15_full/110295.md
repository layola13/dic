The word "ligge" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps you could provide more context where you encountered this word.

2. **It's a word from another language:**  "Ligge" might be a word from a different language.  If you can tell me the language, I might be able to help translate it.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word or a slang term not yet widely recognized.


Without more information, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  Please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
