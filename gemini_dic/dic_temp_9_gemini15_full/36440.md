词源:
The word "colbertine" is named after the French statesman Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619-1683), who oversaw the development of French textile industries. While the exact origin of the specific weave is unclear, the name suggests a connection to the period of his influence, when French textiles were highly valued.
