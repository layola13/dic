词源：The word is formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively) and the noun "pensiveness," which originally referred to the habit of spending money or being generous. However, the modern understanding of "pensiveness" is more associated with thoughtfulness and melancholy.  The word evolved from the older sense of "pensiveness" related to spending.  The evolution reflects a shift in the common usage of the root word.
