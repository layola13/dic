halophyte:/ˈhæləfaɪt/| n. |盐生植物|A halophyte is a plant that grows in soils with a high salt concentration.  Halophytes are found in a variety of saline environments, including salt marshes, mangroves, and inland saline soils. They have evolved various mechanisms to tolerate or even thrive in these conditions.| Example:  Many species of halophytes are found in coastal areas. 许多盐生植物物种都生长在沿海地区。|近义词：salt-tolerant plant|反义词：glycophyte


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Halophytes thrive in saline environments. = 盐生植物在盐碱环境中茁壮成长。
The plant absorbs salt efficiently. = 植物有效地吸收盐分。


一般过去时:
Researchers studied the halophyte's adaptation. = 研究人员研究了这种盐生植物的适应性。
The experiment demonstrated salt tolerance. = 实验证明了耐盐性。


现在完成时:
