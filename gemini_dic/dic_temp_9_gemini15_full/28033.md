capacitors:/kəˈpæsɪtərz/| n.|电容器|An electronic component that stores electrical energy in an electric field.  It consists of two conductive plates separated by an insulating material (dielectric).|例句：The circuit board uses several capacitors to smooth out the power supply.  电路板使用几个电容器来平滑电源。

例句：We need to replace the faulty capacitors in the amplifier. 我们需要更换放大器中故障的电容器。


近义词：condenser (less common in modern usage)
反义词：None (no direct antonym, as it doesn't represent a binary concept)
词性：名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The capacitors store energy efficiently. = 电容器高效地储存能量。
