词源:

* **institution (n.):**  From Latin *institutio*, meaning "establishment, instruction, setting up."  This ultimately derives from the verb *instituere*, meaning "to set up, establish, instruct."

* **-al (adj. suffix):**  From Old French *-al*, ultimately from Latin *-alis*.  Forms adjectives from nouns.

* **-ise (v. suffix):** From Old French *-iser*, ultimately from Latin *-izare*, a suffix that forms verbs meaning "to make into."  The British spelling is *-ise*, while the American spelling is *-ize*.

* **-ing (v. suffix):** Present participle suffix indicating an ongoing action.

Therefore, "institutionalising" means "making into an institution" or "establishing as an institution."
