词源:  The word is formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessive") to "sentimentality."  "Sentimentality" itself comes from "sentimental," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "sentire," meaning "to feel."  Therefore, oversentimentality literally means "excessive feeling" or "excessive emotional response," often in an exaggerated or inappropriate way.
