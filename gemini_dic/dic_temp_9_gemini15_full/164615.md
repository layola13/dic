preexhaustions:/ˌpriːɪɡzɔːʃənz/| n.| 预先耗尽；预先疲惫 |The word "preexhaustions" is a relatively rare and uncommon word, formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") with "exhaustions" (the noun form of "exhaust," meaning to use up completely). It refers to the state of being exhausted before a significant activity or event, or the act of exhausting something beforehand.  It suggests a depletion of resources, energy, or strength before they are needed.  There isn't a widely established definition or common usage.  It's more likely to be encountered in specialized contexts or academic writing. |例句：The team's preexhaustions from the previous grueling matches led to a disappointing performance in the finals. =  之前的几场艰苦比赛使球队在决赛中筋疲力尽，导致表现不佳。
