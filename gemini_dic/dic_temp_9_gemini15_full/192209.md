The word "scratchest" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a non-standard formation.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It might be an attempt to create a superlative form of "scratchy" (meaning rough or irritating to the touch), but the correct superlative would be "scratchiest".
