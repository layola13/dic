词源:  The word "deghosted" is a relatively recent coinage, formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse") to the word "ghosted."  "Ghosted" in this context refers to the presence of unwanted artifacts or "ghosts" in images, audio, or data.  The term's creation reflects the growing need to describe the process of removing these unwanted elements in digital media.
