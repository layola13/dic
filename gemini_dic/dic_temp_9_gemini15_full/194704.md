词源：

* **self-**:  Old English *self*, meaning "self, same."

* **willed**:  Past participle of *will*, from Old English *willan*, meaning "to wish, desire, intend."  This reflects the strong sense of personal desire and intention underlying self-willedness.  The "-ed" ending creates an adjectival form, meaning "characterized by will."

* **-ness**:  A suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.

Therefore, self-willedness literally means "the state of being characterized by one's own will."
