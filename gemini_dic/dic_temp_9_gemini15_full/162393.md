preadamite:/ˌpriːˈædəmaɪt/| n. | 前亚当人；前人类；|A preadamite is a hypothetical human being or race believed to have existed before Adam, the first man in the biblical account of creation.  The concept was popular in some theological circles, particularly during the 17th and 18th centuries, as a way to reconcile biblical accounts with evidence suggesting a greater antiquity of humankind.  Proponents often pointed to archaeological finds or interpreted biblical passages to support the existence of a pre-Adamic population. However, the theory is not widely accepted by mainstream religious or scientific communities.|The discovery of ancient tools suggested to some the existence of preadamites.|近义词：antediluvian (referring to a time before the biblical flood), ancient human|反义词：postdiluvian (referring to a time after the biblical flood)
