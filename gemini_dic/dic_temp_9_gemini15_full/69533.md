词源:

The word "fellers" is a plural form of "feller," which is a now somewhat archaic and chiefly dialectal variant of "fellow."  "Fellow" itself comes from the Old English word "fēola," meaning "partner, companion."  The "-er" suffix is a common agentive suffix, indicating a person who does something.  Over time, "feller" became a more informal and often affectionate term for a man or boy.  The plural "fellers" maintains this informal and friendly connotation.
