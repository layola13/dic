jpegs:/ˈdʒeɪpɛɡz/| n. |JPEG图像文件|JPEG (Joint Photographic Experts Group) is a common method of compressing image files.  It is a lossy compression method, meaning some image data is lost during the compression process, but it generally provides a good balance between file size and image quality. JPEGs are widely used for photographs and other images on the internet and in digital devices.  | Example: I saved the photo as a JPEG file. 我把照片保存成了JPEG文件。|近义词：image files, pictures|反义词：None  (it's a file format, not an adjective)|名词
