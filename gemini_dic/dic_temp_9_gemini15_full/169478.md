词源:  The word "propagandising" is derived from the noun "propaganda," which originates from the Latin word "Congregatio de Propaganda Fide," meaning "Congregation for Propagating the Faith." This was a committee established by Pope Gregory XV in 1622 to oversee missionary work and spread Catholicism. Over time, the term "propaganda" took on its current meaning, referring to the dissemination of information, often biased or misleading, to promote a particular cause.  The "-ising" suffix indicates the act of doing something.
