词源:

The word "launchable" is derived from the verb "launch," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "lancer," meaning "to throw, hurl, or dart."  The meaning evolved to include the act of setting something afloat (like a ship) and later, the figurative sense of starting or introducing something new (like a product or project).  The "-able" suffix transforms the verb into an adjective, indicating capability or suitability.
