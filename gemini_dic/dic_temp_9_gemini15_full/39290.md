conic:/ˈkɑːnɪk/| /ˈkɒnɪk/| n.|圆锥曲线；圆锥形的|A conic section (or simply conic) is a curve obtained as the intersection of the surface of a cone with a plane.  The type of curve obtained depends on the angle of the plane relative to the cone.  Conics include circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. |Example:  The parabola is a type of conic section.|近义词：curve, section|反义词：straight line|名词
