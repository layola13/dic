词源:

* **quasi-**:  from Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation to something but not its complete fulfillment.

* **congenial**: from Latin *congenialis*,  meaning "born together," implying inherent suitability or harmony.  This is derived from *con-* (together) + *genialis* (born, related to *genus*, meaning "kind" or "race").
