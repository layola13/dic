/ˌpriːkəˈrektnəsɪz/ | n. | 预先正确性；预先校正；预先精确性 |  The word "precorrectnesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, formed by adding the prefix "pre-" to "correctnesses."  It attempts to convey the idea of correctness that is established or ensured *before* something happens or is implemented.  The meaning is highly context-dependent and requires careful consideration of the surrounding text to understand its intended meaning.  There is no established definition or usage in dictionaries or corpora. |  Example:  (Hypothetical usage illustrating the intended, yet unusual, meaning)  "The meticulous planning ensured the precorrectnesses of the project, minimizing potential errors."  | 近义词: (Depending on context)  precautions, preventative measures, safeguards, accuracy, precision | 反义词: (Depending on context) errors, mistakes, inaccuracies, imprecision | n.
