词源:
The term "low-level" is a compound word.  "Low" means of little height or importance, and "level" refers to a stage or rank. The combination indicates a position or function of little importance or complexity, particularly in relation to a hierarchical structure (e.g., in programming or organizational charts).  Its usage in computing emerged with the development of computer architecture and programming languages, differentiating between the machine-level instructions and higher-level abstractions.
