The word "hiashi" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It might be a misspelling, a word from another language, or a proper noun.  To provide the analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (A book, a website, a conversation, etc.)
* **What is the surrounding text?**  This will help determine the intended meaning.

If you can provide this context, I can attempt to offer a possible interpretation and analysis.
