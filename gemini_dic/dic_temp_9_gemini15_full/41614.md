/kɔˌreɪdieɪʃən/ | n. | 共同辐射; 共同照射 |  The word "corradiation" is a relatively rare and less common term. It refers to the simultaneous irradiation of something from multiple sources.  It's essentially a combination of "co-" (together) and "radiation."  While there isn't a widely established definition, the context usually implies a coordinated or simultaneous exposure to radiation.   | Example: The study investigated the effects of corradiation on cell growth. 这项研究调查了共同辐射对细胞生长的影响。 |  co-irradiation,  simultaneous irradiation |  shielding, protection | 名词


USAGE->
This word is so rare that providing examples for all grammatical tenses is impractical and unrealistic.  The usage would primarily follow the patterns of a typical noun.

一般现在时:
Corradiation is a complex phenomenon. = 共同辐射是一种复杂的现象。
The experiment involves corradiation of samples. = 实验涉及样本的共同辐射。


一般过去时:
Corradiation was the focus of the research. = 共同辐射是研究的重点。
Scientists observed corradiation effects. = 科学家观察到了共同辐射效应。


现在完成时:
Researchers have studied corradiation extensively. = 研究人员已经广泛研究了共同辐射。
The implications of corradiation have yet to be fully understood. = 共同辐射的意义还有待充分理解。


过去完成时:
They had completed the corradiation experiment. = 他们已经完成了共同辐射实验。
Before the discovery, corradiation effects were unknown. = 在发现之前，共同辐射效应是未知的。


将来时:
Scientists will conduct further corradiation studies. = 科学家将进行进一步的共同辐射研究。
The next experiment will test the effects of corradiation. = 下一个实验将测试共同辐射的影响。


虚拟语气:
If there were no corradiation, the results would be different. = 如果没有共同辐射，结果将会不同。
It is as if the corradiation caused the anomaly. = 好像共同辐射导致了异常。


被动语态:
The samples were subjected to corradiation. = 样本受到了共同辐射。
Corradiation effects were measured precisely. = 共同辐射效应被精确测量。


疑问句:
What type of corradiation was used in the experiment? = 实验中使用了哪种类型的共同辐射？
Was corradiation a factor in the observed results? = 共同辐射是否是观察结果的一个因素？


否定句:
There was no corradiation in the control group. = 对照组没有共同辐射。
The experiment did not involve corradiation. = 实验不涉及共同辐射。


PHRASE->
Phrases using "corradiation" are extremely limited due to the word's rarity.  Creating common phrases artificially would be misleading.  The usage would typically involve prepositional phrases to describe the specifics of the corradiation, such as "corradiation from multiple sources", "effects of corradiation on...", etc.
