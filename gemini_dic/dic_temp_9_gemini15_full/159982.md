polyreaction:/ˌpɒliriˈækʃən/| n. |聚合反应，多步反应|A chemical reaction in which many molecules combine to form a larger molecule, often a polymer.  This process involves the repetition of a single reaction step many times.|例句：The formation of polyethylene is a classic example of a polyreaction. 聚乙烯的形成是聚合反应的一个经典例子。
The synthesis of proteins involves a complex series of polyreactions. 蛋白质的合成涉及一系列复杂的多步反应。|近义词：polymerization, chain reaction|反义词：decomposition, depolymerization
