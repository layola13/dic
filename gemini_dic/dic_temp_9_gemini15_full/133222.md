nonexchangeabilities: /ˌnɒnɪkˈstʃeɪndʒəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 不可交换性；非交换性 | The inherent properties that prevent certain things from being exchanged or substituted.  This term often appears in economics, physics, and other fields describing situations where a one-to-one substitution is impossible or impractical. For example, in quantum mechanics, certain particles exhibit nonexchangeabilities in their interactions.  | Example: The nonexchangeabilities of certain quantum states make them fundamentally different from classical systems.  | 近义词:  incommensurability, irreplaceability, incomparability | 反义词: interchangeability, substitutability |  


The word is formed from:

* **non-**:  prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of"
* **exchangeabilities**: noun form of "exchangeable," which itself is derived from:
    * **exchange**: verb meaning "to give or receive something in return for something else."  Originating from Old French "eschanger" and ultimately from Latin "excambiare," meaning "to exchange."
    * **-able**: suffix meaning "capable of being" or "suitable for."


USAGE->
(Since "nonexchangeabilities" is a noun, it doesn't have verb conjugations like "what" in the example.)

* **In a sentence with a simple present tense verb:** The experiment demonstrated the nonexchangeabilities of the particles. = 实验证明了这些粒子的不可交换性。
* **In a sentence with a past tense verb:**  Researchers previously overlooked the nonexchangeabilities involved in this reaction. = 研究人员以前忽略了该反应中涉及的不可交换性。


PHRASE->
(Phrases using "nonexchangeabilities" are typically more complex and context-dependent.)
* **The principle of nonexchangeabilities:** 不可交换性原理
* **Demonstrate nonexchangeabilities:** 证明不可交换性
* **Study of nonexchangeabilities:** 不可交换性研究
* **Implications of nonexchangeabilities:** 不可交换性的影响
* **Overcoming nonexchangeabilities:** 克服不可交换性
