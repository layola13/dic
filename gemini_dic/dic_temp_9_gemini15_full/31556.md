The word "charumati" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a word from a specific dialect or language, or a proper noun.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage explanation cannot be provided.  To provide the requested information, I need more context, such as:

* **The source of the word:** Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the context (a book, website, conversation, etc.) will help determine its origin and meaning.
* **Possible intended spelling:**  Is there a similar-sounding or -looking word that might be the correct spelling?
* **Language of origin:** If it's not English, specifying the language would allow for a more accurate analysis.

Without this information, I cannot fulfill your request.
