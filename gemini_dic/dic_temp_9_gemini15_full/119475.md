USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective and doesn't have verb conjugations like "hello."  It describes a concentration.  There's no need for tense variations.

例句1：The solution was prepared at a micromolar concentration.  溶液以微摩尔浓度配制。
例句2：Micromolar levels of this compound are sufficient to elicit a response. 此化合物的微摩尔水平足以引发反应。


PHRASE->
This word is not typically used in phrases, as it primarily functions as a unit of measurement in scientific contexts.  Phrases would involve the context in which the concentration is being used, for example: "micromolar concentration of drug X",  "achieve a micromolar concentration"



词源:
The word "micromolar" is a combination of "micro-" (from Greek μικρός, mikrós, meaning "small") and "molar" (referring to moles, the base unit of amount of substance in chemistry).  Therefore, it literally means "one millionth of a mole per liter."
