The word "raunsoun" is not a recognized word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  If you could provide context (where you saw this word), it might be possible to determine the intended word.

2. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name, place, or brand name not widely known.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, a word used within a specific community, or slang not yet recognized in standard dictionaries.

4. **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word from another language that has not been translated or transliterated correctly.


Because "raunsoun" doesn't exist in standard English, I cannot provide the requested information (pronunciation, word class, meaning, etc.)  Please clarify the word or provide more context.
