英文解析:
The word "nontortuous" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "tortuous," which describes something that is twisting, winding, or excessively complicated.  Therefore, "nontortuous" signifies the opposite: something that is straight, direct, and uncomplicated.  It implies a lack of curves, bends, or complexities in a path, process, or argument.
