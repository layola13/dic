词源:The word "gopher" comes from the Middle English word "gopher," which itself is of uncertain origin.  Some etymologists suggest a connection to a similar-sounding word in a now-extinct language.  The word's usage for the animal is likely derived from early explorers' observations of the rodent's burrowing behavior.  The use as a term for a person who runs errands is a later development, based on the animal's association with digging and moving things around.
