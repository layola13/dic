simulates:/ˈsɪmjuleɪts/| vt.|模拟，仿真|To create a representation or model of (something), especially using a computer.  It often implies imitating the essential characteristics of something, rather than creating an exact replica.|例句：The software simulates flight conditions.  该软件模拟飞行条件。

例句：The experiment simulates real-world conditions.  该实验模拟现实世界条件。


近义词：imitates, replicates, emulates, models

反义词：None directly opposite, but "ignores" or "neglects" could be considered contrasting actions.
