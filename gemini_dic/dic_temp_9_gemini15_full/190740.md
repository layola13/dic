词源:  The word "savage" comes from the Old French word "sauvage," meaning "wild," "untamed," or "from the woods."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "silvaticus," meaning "of the woods" or "forest-dwelling."  The original meaning was simply descriptive of people living outside of settled, civilized societies, but over time, it acquired increasingly negative connotations, associated with violence, barbarity, and a lack of morality.
