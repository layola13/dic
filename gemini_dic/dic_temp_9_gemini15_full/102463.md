词源:

The word "jackpot" originates from the early days of poker.  In poker, a "jackpot" was a pot of money contributed by all players when the game was started, usually including an ante from each player.  Over time, the term broadened to encompass any large prize or unexpected windfall.  The connection is primarily metaphorical, focusing on the unexpectedly large sum of money involved.
