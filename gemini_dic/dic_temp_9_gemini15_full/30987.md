The word "chalera" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Perhaps "cholera"?

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or term used within a specific community or context.  If this is the case, more information about where you encountered the word is needed.

3. **It's a proper noun:**  A name of a person, place, or thing. Again, more context is required.


If you can provide more context (where you saw the word, the surrounding text, etc.), I can offer a more accurate analysis.  If you meant "cholera," I can provide the requested information for that word instead.
