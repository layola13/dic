词源:  The word "companionship" derives from the Old French word "compaignie," which itself comes from the Latin "com-," meaning "with," and "panis," meaning "bread."  Originally, a "companion" was someone with whom one shared bread—a fellow traveler or associate.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the broader sense of friendship and shared experiences.
