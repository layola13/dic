USAGE->
This word is a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations.  Therefore, tense-related examples (present, past, future, etc.) are not applicable.  The word itself describes a state or quality.


PHRASE->
This word, being a complex noun, doesn't readily lend itself to common phrasal combinations in the same way simpler words do.  Phrasal examples are therefore not easily generated.
