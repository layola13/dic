词源:

The word "gibbousness" derives from the word "gibbous," which in turn comes from the Late Latin word *gibbosus*, meaning "humpbacked," "bent," or "crooked."  This ultimately traces back to the Proto-Indo-European root *geub-, meaning "to bend" or "to arch." The "-ness" suffix adds the meaning of "state or quality of being."  Therefore, "gibbousness" literally describes the state of being humpbacked or bulging.
