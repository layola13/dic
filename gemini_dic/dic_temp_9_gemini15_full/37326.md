It's a plural form of "commemorativeness," which itself is less common than related words.  It attempts to create a noun referring to multiple instances of something being commemorative.

A better phrasing would be preferred.) | commemorations, celebrations, observances | forgetfulness, oblivion | noun


USAGE->
This word is so uncommon that providing examples of its usage in different tenses is impractical and misleading.  It's best to use more standard English vocabulary for expressing the concept of commemorative events or qualities.

PHRASE->
This word doesn't have common phrases associated with it due to its rarity.  It's better to use phrases built around more common words like "commemoration," "memorial," or "celebration."

For example, instead of using "commemorativenesses," consider these alternatives and their corresponding phrases:

* **Commemoration:**  "The annual commemoration of the battle," "a fitting commemoration of his life."
* **Memorial:** "A moving memorial to the victims," "a lasting memorial to their sacrifice."
* **Celebration:** "A joyous celebration of their victory," "a vibrant celebration of culture."

Using these common words will make your writing clearer and more understandable.
