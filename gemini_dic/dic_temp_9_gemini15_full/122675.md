modulator:/ˈmɒdʒuleɪtər/ /ˈmɑːdʒəleɪtər/| n. | 调制器；调节器；缓和剂 | A modulator is a device or system that modifies or regulates a signal or process.  It can change the amplitude, frequency, or phase of a signal, or it can control the rate or intensity of a process. | Example: The audio modulator adjusted the sound waves before transmission.  音频调制器在传输前调整声波。 The medication acted as a mood modulator, calming her anxiety.  这种药物充当情绪调节剂，减轻了她的焦虑。|近义词：regulator, controller, adjuster |反义词：amplifier (in some contexts)
