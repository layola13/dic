Etymology:

The word "gibberish" ultimately derives from the Arabic word "خَبَرْ" (khabar), meaning "news" or "message".  Through a complex evolution involving  Middle English and various linguistic shifts, this term came to be associated with unintelligible speech or writing.  Specifically,  "gibberish" likely evolved from the practice of mimicking or imitating foreign languages in a nonsensical way.  The exact path is debated, but it’s clear the semantic shift was profound.
