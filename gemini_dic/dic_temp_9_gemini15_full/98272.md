词源:

The word "inservient" is derived from the Latin words "in-" (meaning "in" or "into") and "serviens" (the present participle of "servire," meaning "to serve").  Therefore, the root meaning points to being excessively engaged in serving, often to a degree that suggests a lack of self-respect or dignity.  The prefix "in-" in this case intensifies the meaning of "servient," highlighting the excessive or inappropriate nature of the service.
