interlobular:/ˌɪntərˈlɒbjələr/ | adj. |小叶间的；叶间隙的 | Relating to the spaces or tissues between lobules (small lobes).  It's commonly used in anatomy and histology to describe structures or processes located between lobules of an organ, such as the liver or lung. | Example: Interlobular septa divide the liver into functional units.  小叶间隔膜将肝脏分成功能单位。|近义词：interlobular (no true synonyms, but could be described as "between lobules") |反义词：intralobular (within lobules)


词源:

* **inter-**:  From Latin, meaning "between" or "among".
* **lobul-**: From Latin "lobulus," a diminutive of "lobus," meaning "lobe."
* **-ar**:  A suffix forming adjectives, meaning "relating to" or "pertaining to".

Therefore, "interlobular" literally means "between lobules".
