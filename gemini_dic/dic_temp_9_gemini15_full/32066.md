词源：From "cherub" + "-ically".  "Cherub" originates from the Hebrew word כרוב (kerub), meaning "guardian," "one who intercedes," or "one who praises." These beings were depicted in ancient Near Eastern art and later adopted into Christian theology as celestial beings, often depicted as winged infants or children.  The "-ically" suffix is a common adverbial ending in English, indicating "in a manner of" or "in the way of."
