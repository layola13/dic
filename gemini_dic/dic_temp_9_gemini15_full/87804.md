词源:
The word "hiccup" (and its past tense "hiccoughed") originates from the Middle English word "hik," possibly an onomatopoeia (a word imitating a sound), and later influenced by the Old French word "hoquet."  The spelling variations reflect the evolution of the word through different linguistic periods.
