The word "loer" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you provide more context where you encountered this word?  Knowing the context will help determine the intended word.  For example, it could be a misspelling of "lower," "lour," or a proper noun.

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a slang term, or a word specific to a particular dialect or community.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **It's a typographical error:** A simple typo could have resulted in this word.
