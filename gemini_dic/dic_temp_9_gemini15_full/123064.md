词源:
The word "money" ultimately derives from the Roman term "moneta," which was an epithet of Juno, the Roman goddess associated with the mint.  The mint in ancient Rome was where coins were made, and thus "moneta" came to refer to the coins themselves, and eventually evolved into the modern English word "money."
