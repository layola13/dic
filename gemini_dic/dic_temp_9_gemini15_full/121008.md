There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "miscognizant."  The word itself is relatively uncommon and formal.  Phrases would need to be constructed around it.  For example:  "completely miscognizant of," "largely miscognizant of," "dangerously miscognizant of," etc.


词源:
The word "miscognizant" is formed from the prefix "mis-" (meaning wrong or bad), and "cognizant," which derives from the Latin word "cognoscere" (to know or understand).  Therefore, "miscognizant" literally means "not knowing" or "wrongly knowing."
