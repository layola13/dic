saussurite:/ˈsɔːsərʌɪt/| n. |钠长石，黝帘石|A granular, usually light-colored rock composed essentially of albite, epidote, and zoisite, formed by the alteration of plagioclase feldspar.  It is often found in metamorphic rocks.|例句：The geologist identified the sample as saussurite, a product of metamorphic alteration. 地质学家将样品鉴定为钠长石，一种变质蚀变的产物。|近义词：None precisely, but rocks with similar compositions could be considered.|反义词：None specifically.|名词
