controllability: /ˌkənˌtrəʊləˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可控性，可控制性 | The degree to which a system or process can be controlled.  It refers to the ability to influence or manipulate the behavior of a system to achieve a desired outcome.  This concept is crucial in various fields, including engineering, economics, and social sciences. | Example: The controllability of the aircraft was compromised by the severe weather conditions.  飞机的可控性因恶劣天气条件而受损。


The system's controllability is a key factor in its overall effectiveness. 系统的可控性是其整体有效性的关键因素。|近义词：manageability, governability |反义词：uncontrollability, randomness


Etymology:  The word "controllability" is derived from the verb "control," which ultimately traces back to the Old French word "controlee," meaning "to check" or "to verify."  The suffix "-ability" signifies the capacity or potential for something.  Therefore, "controllability" essentially means "the capacity to be controlled."
