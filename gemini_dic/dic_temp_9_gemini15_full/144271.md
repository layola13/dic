outsophisticating: /ˌaʊt.səˌfɪs.tɪ.keɪ.tɪŋ/ | v. |  超越…的精致；比…更精致 |  To surpass in sophistication; to be more sophisticated than. This is not a standard dictionary word; it's a neologism, meaning a newly coined word or expression.  It's formed by adding the prefix "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent than") to the word "sophisticating," which itself is the present participle of "sophisticate."  Therefore, it implies a competition or comparison of sophistication.  |  例句：The new design outsophisticates all previous models in its elegant simplicity. 新设计以其优雅简洁超越了所有之前的型号。
