gnathopod:/ˈnæθəpɒd/ | n. |颚足|A pair of appendages on the thorax of a crustacean, typically modified for grasping or feeding.  These appendages are often highly specialized, showing significant variation depending on the species and their ecological niche.  They are particularly well-developed in amphipods and isopods.|例句：The amphipod's gnathopods were strong enough to hold onto seaweed.|近义词：maxilliped (in some contexts)|反义词：无
