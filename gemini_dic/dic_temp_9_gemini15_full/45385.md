词源：

The word "cunt" has a long and complex etymology, tracing back to Proto-Germanic and Proto-Indo-European roots.  Its origins are related to words meaning "woman" or "vagina," but its evolution has been heavily influenced by its use as a derogatory term.  The precise historical path is debated, but its offensive nature is undeniable and has solidified over centuries.


用法说明：

The word "cunt" is considered one of the most offensive words in the English language. Its use is almost always inappropriate and should be avoided in any context.  Any attempt to use it in a non-offensive way is highly likely to backfire and cause offense.  There are no legitimate situations where this word should be used.  Understanding its meaning is important for recognizing offensive language, but using it is never acceptable.
