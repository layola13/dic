The word "leamer" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word like "learner," "leach," "leamer," or a proper noun?  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **A neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context. If this is the case, please provide more context (where you encountered this word) so I can assist you better.

3. **A technical term:** It might be a term specific to a particular field (e.g., a scientific term, a technical jargon).  Again, providing context will be crucial.


Without knowing the intended word, I cannot provide the requested analysis including pronunciation, word class, meaning, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical examples.  Please clarify the word or provide more context.
