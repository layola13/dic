The word "langan" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a detailed analysis with pronunciation, part of speech, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical examples as requested.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:** Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* **A proper noun:** It might be a place name, a person's name, or a brand name.
* **A word from a dialect or a specific field:**  It could be a term used in a particular region or profession.
* **A newly coined word:**  It's possible the word is very recent and hasn't been included in dictionaries yet.


To help me provide the requested analysis, please:

1. **Verify the spelling:**  Make sure the spelling is correct.
2. **Provide context:** Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the context (sentence, book, website, etc.) will help determine its meaning and usage.

Once you provide this information, I can attempt to analyze the word.
