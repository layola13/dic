词源:
The word "skimp" ultimately derives from the Middle Dutch word "schimp," meaning "shame," "reproach," or "scolding."  Its evolution involved a shift in meaning, likely reflecting a sense of disapproval associated with stinginess or parsimony.  The modern meaning of "to be stingy" or "to economize excessively" emerged over time.
