microspore:/ˈmaɪkrəʊspɔːr/|/ˈmaɪkrəʊspoʊr/| n. |小孢子|A microspore is a haploid spore that develops into a male gametophyte, such as a pollen grain in seed plants.  It is a single cell produced by meiosis in the microsporangium (part of the anther in flowering plants).|Example: The microspores undergo mitosis to produce pollen grains.|近义词:pollen grain (in seed plants)|反义词:megaspore

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The microspore develops into a pollen grain. = 小孢子发育成为花粉粒。
Microspores are produced by meiosis. = 小孢子由减数分裂产生。


一般过去时:
The microspore developed into a pollen grain. = 小孢子发育成为花粉粒。
Scientists observed the microspore's development. = 科学家观察了小孢子的发育。


现在完成时:
The plant has released its microspores. = 植物已经释放了它的孢子。
Researchers have studied microspore development extensively. = 研究人员已经广泛研究了小孢子的发育。


过去完成时:
The microspore had already germinated before the experiment began. = 实验开始前小孢子已经萌发了。
The pollen grain had developed from a microspore. = 花粉粒是由小孢子发育而来的。


将来时:
The microspore will develop into a male gametophyte. = 小孢子将发育成为雄性配子体。
Scientists will further investigate the microspore's genetics. = 科学家将进一步研究小孢子的遗传学。


虚拟语气:
If the microspore were viable, it would germinate. = 如果小孢子是可行的，它就会萌发。
It is essential that the microspore be healthy for successful fertilization. = 小孢子健康对于成功的受精至关重要。


被动语态:
The microspores are produced by the anther. = 小孢子由花药产生。
The microspore's development was carefully monitored. = 小孢子的发育被仔细监测。


疑问句:
How many microspores are produced per anther? = 每朵花药产生多少小孢子？
What triggers the germination of the microspore? = 什么触发了小孢子的萌发？


否定句:
The microspore did not germinate. = 小孢子没有萌发。
The experiment did not yield viable microspores. = 实验没有产生可行的小孢子。


PHRASE->
microspore mother cell:小孢子母细胞
microspore development:小孢子发育
microspore wall:小孢子壁
microspore formation:小孢子形成
