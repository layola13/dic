词源:
The word "precipitate" comes from the Late Latin word *praecipitāre*, meaning "to throw headlong" or "to hurl down." This in turn derives from the Latin prefix *prae-* (before, beforehand) and *capitare* (to fall head first). The chemical sense of "to separate from solution as a solid" emerged in the 17th century, reflecting the visual similarity of a substance suddenly falling out of solution.  The sense of "to bring about suddenly or prematurely" developed later, based on the idea of something being "thrown headlong" into a new state or situation.
