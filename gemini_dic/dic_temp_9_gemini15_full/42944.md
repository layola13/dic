词源:
The word "cover" ultimately derives from the Old French word "cuvrir," meaning "to cover" or "to hide."  This in turn has roots in the Vulgar Latin word "co-operire," a compound of "co-" (together) and "operire" (to cover).  The evolution reflects the consistent meaning of protection and concealment across languages and time.
