feel self-disquieting: 感到不安
become self-disquieting: 变得令人不安
a self-disquieting silence: 一种令人不安的寂静
a self-disquieting atmosphere: 一种令人不安的气氛

词源：
self- :  来自古英语 *self,  意思是"自己"。
disquieting: 来自动词disquiet，dis- (表示否定或加强) + quiet (安静的)。  因此，disquiet的意思是"使不安"，"使焦虑"。  -ing 形容词后缀表示具有某种性质或状态。  所以 self-disquieting 字面意思是"使自己不安的"。
