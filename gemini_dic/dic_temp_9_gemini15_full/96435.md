词源:

The word "indistinctness" is derived from the word "distinct," meaning clear and easily perceived.  The prefix "in-" adds the meaning of "not" or "opposite of," thus creating "indistinct," meaning unclear or not easily perceived. The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "indistinct" into a noun, indicating the state or quality of being indistinct.


用法说明:

"Indistinctness" is a noun referring to a lack of clarity or precision.  It can describe something that is difficult to see, hear, understand, or identify because it is unclear, blurred, or muffled.  The context will determine the specific aspect of indistinctness being described – visual, auditory, or conceptual.
