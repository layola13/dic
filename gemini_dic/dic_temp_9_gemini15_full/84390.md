词源:  The word is a blend of "hallelujah" and "-atic," a suffix forming adjectives. "Hallelujah" itself comes from Hebrew "הַלְלוּיָהּ" (hallelu-Yah), meaning "Praise ye Yah (Yahweh, God)."  The "-atic" suffix adds the sense of being characterized by or pertaining to.  Therefore, "hallelujatic" describes something characterized by exuberant praise, particularly of a religious nature.
