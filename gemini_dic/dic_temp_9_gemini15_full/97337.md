词源:
The word "informing" comes from the verb "inform," which originates from the Old French word "informer," meaning "to give shape or form to; to instruct; to tell."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin "informare," a combination of "in-" (into) and "formare" (to form, shape).  The evolution shows a shift from the original sense of shaping or giving form to the more modern sense of imparting information.
