词源:
The word "multimodality" is a combination of "multi-" (meaning many or multiple) and "modality" (referring to a particular method, system, or way of doing something, especially in communication).  Therefore, it literally means "having many modes".  The term emerged in the field of linguistics and semiotics,  later expanding its use in other areas like education, design, and technology.
