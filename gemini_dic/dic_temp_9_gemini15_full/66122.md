词源：

The word "eccentric" comes from the Late Middle English word "eccentric," derived from the Late Latin word "eccentricus," meaning "out of the center."  This, in turn, is from the Greek words "ek-" (out) and "kentron" (center).  The original meaning referred to something literally off-center, like a circle not perfectly centered on another.  The metaphorical meaning of being unconventional or unusual developed later.
