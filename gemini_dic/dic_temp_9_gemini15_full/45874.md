词源:

The word "cute" ultimately derives from the past participle of the obsolete Middle English word "cut," meaning "short" or "clever."  The transition to its modern meaning is not entirely clear but likely involved a semantic shift through a sense of "well-made" or "clever" before evolving into the modern sense of "charmingly small and appealing".  The association with smallness and attractiveness became dominant over time.
