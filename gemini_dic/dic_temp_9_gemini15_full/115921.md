marquarts:/ˈmɑːrkwɑːrts/| n.| 马夸特算法 |Marquardt algorithm is a numerical optimization algorithm that combines the gradient descent and the Gauss-Newton algorithm.  It is used to solve nonlinear least squares problems.  The algorithm is particularly useful when dealing with ill-conditioned Hessian matrices, a common problem in nonlinear regression.  It adaptively adjusts between the two algorithms, using gradient descent when far from the minimum and Gauss-Newton when close. This allows for a robust and efficient convergence to the solution.  |例句：The researchers used the Marquardt algorithm to fit a nonlinear model to their experimental data.  研究人员使用马夸特算法将非线性模型拟合到他们的实验数据。|近义词：Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (often used interchangeably)|反义词：无|名词
