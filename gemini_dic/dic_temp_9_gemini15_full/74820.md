The word "Frenchs" does not exist as a standalone word in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a proper noun referring to a specific entity (like a family name or a brand name).  Therefore, a full etymological and grammatical analysis is impossible without further context.  To provide a meaningful response, I need clarification on the intended word or phrase.
