词源:

From Middle French *flamboyant, from Old French *flambe, present participle of flamber "to flame," from Vulgar Latin *flammare, from Latin flamma "flame".  The sense development is from "flame-like" (referring to the shape of flame-like Gothic architecture) to "showy, ostentatious" due to the bright and striking nature of flame.
