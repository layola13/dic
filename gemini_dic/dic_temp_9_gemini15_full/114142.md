The word "maharmah" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a word from another language.  Therefore, a complete phonetic transcription, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., cannot be provided.  To provide the requested analysis, I need a correctly spelled word or clarification of its origin.
