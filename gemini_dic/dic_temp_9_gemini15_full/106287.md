词源:  The word combines "knuckle" (referring to the joints of the fingers) and "headed," implying a head as hard and unyielding as a knuckle.  The implication is that such a person is hard-headed and stubbornly unintelligent.  The exact origin is difficult to pinpoint, but it likely emerged as a colloquialism in the late 20th century.
