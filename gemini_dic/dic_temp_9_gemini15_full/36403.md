词源:  The word "coition" comes from the Late Latin word *coitio, meaning "a coming together,"  itself derived from the verb *coire, meaning "to go together," "to unite," or "to meet."  This ultimately traces back to the Proto-Indo-European root *kei-, meaning "to lie down."  The semantic shift from "coming together" to specifically "sexual intercourse" occurred over time.
