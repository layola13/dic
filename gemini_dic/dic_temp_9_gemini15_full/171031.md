pseudospore: /ˈsuːdəʊspɔːr/ | n. | 假孢子 | A pseudospore is a structure in some organisms that resembles a spore but is not a true spore produced by meiosis. It is typically formed by asexual reproduction and does not undergo meiosis to produce haploid cells. Instead, it may be a modified vegetative cell or a fragment of hyphae.  Pseudospores are involved in dispersal and survival, but their formation and function vary significantly depending on the organism. | Example:  Many fungi produce pseudospores as a means of asexual reproduction and dispersal.  某些真菌产生假孢子作为无性繁殖和传播的一种方式。 | 近义词:  spore-like structure, vegetative cell (in some contexts) | 反义词:  true spore, meiospore
