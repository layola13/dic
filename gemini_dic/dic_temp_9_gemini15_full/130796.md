USAGE->
This word is extremely rare and its usage in various grammatical tenses is not practically applicable.  It's a highly unusual and artificial word formed by adding "-nesses" to "nonanonymous," which itself is already uncommon.  Providing example sentences for all tenses would be contrived and unhelpful.  The word is primarily of theoretical linguistic interest, not practical use.


PHRASE->
There are no common or established phrases using "nonanonymousnesses."  The word is too rare and unwieldy for common phrasal usage.
