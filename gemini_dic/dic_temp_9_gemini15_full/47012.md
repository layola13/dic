dashpot:/ˈdæʃpɑːt/|/ˈdæʃpɒt/| n. |缓冲器；减震器|A dashpot is a mechanical device that uses a viscous fluid to dampen or slow down the movement of a mechanism.  It typically consists of a piston moving within a cylinder filled with a viscous liquid, the resistance of which slows the piston's movement. Dashpots are used in various applications to control speed, prevent oscillations, and absorb shock. |Example: The dashpot in the door closer slows the door's closing speed, preventing it from slamming shut.  缓冲门关闭器中的缓冲器减慢了门的关闭速度，防止其砰地关上。|近义词：damper, shock absorber|反义词：accelerator (in the context of movement)|词性:名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The dashpot controls the speed of the valve. = 缓冲器控制阀门的速度。
This dashpot dampens vibrations effectively. = 这个缓冲器有效地抑制振动。

一般过去时:
