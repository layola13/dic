词源:
The word "fash" comes from the Middle English word "flesshen," meaning "to flourish," "to swagger," or "to show off."  It's related to the Old French word "flascher," meaning "to flash" or "to gleam," highlighting a connection to the idea of ostentatious display.  The modern usage retains this core meaning of showy exhibition.
