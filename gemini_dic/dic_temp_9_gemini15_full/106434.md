The word "korrigum" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Please double-check the spelling.
2. **It's a neologism or a word from another language:**  If it's a newly coined word or from a different language (possibly with a similar pronunciation), please provide more context.  Knowing the source language or the context in which you encountered it would be helpful.
3. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name or place name.


Without more information, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  Please provide additional context or clarify the spelling.
