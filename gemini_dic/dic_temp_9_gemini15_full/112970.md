词源:
The word "lukewarmnesses" is derived from "lukewarm," which combines "luke" (meaning "tepid" or "mildly warm") and "warm."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "lukewarm" into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being lukewarm.  The plural "-es" indicates multiple instances of this state.
