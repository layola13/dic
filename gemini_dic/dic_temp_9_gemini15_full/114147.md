词源：

The word "Mahayana" is of Sanskrit origin.  It is composed of two parts:

* **maha-:**  Meaning "great," "large," or "extensive."
* **yana:** Meaning "vehicle," "path," or "way."

Therefore, "Mahayana" literally translates to "Great Vehicle" or "Great Raft," referring to the path to enlightenment it offers.  The term contrasts with "Hinayana" (小乘佛教), which means "Small Vehicle,"  a term now considered somewhat derogatory by Mahayana Buddhists.


用法说明：

Mahayana is primarily used as a noun to refer to the Mahayana school of Buddhism.  It can be used in various contexts, including academic discussions, religious texts, and everyday conversations about Buddhism.  It's always used with a capital "M" because it's a proper noun.


例句：

1. The principles of Mahayana Buddhism emphasize compassion and the pursuit of enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings.  大乘佛教的原则强调慈悲以及为了所有众生的利益而追求解脱。

2.  Many scholars debate the historical origins and development of Mahayana Buddhism.  许多学者争论大乘佛教的历史起源和发展。


近义词：
