词源:
The word "logistic" ultimately derives from the Greek word "logistikos," meaning "skilled in calculation,"  "reckoning," or "reasoning," related to "logos," meaning "word," "speech," "reason," or "account."  Its use in the sense of military supply and organization developed later, becoming prevalent in the 18th and 19th centuries.  The modern usage encompassing the broader sense of the coordination of complex operations evolved further in the 20th century.
