词源:
The word "metasilicate" is derived from the combining forms "meta-" (indicating a change or modification, often referring to a less hydrated form) and "silicate" (referring to compounds containing silicon and oxygen).  "Silicate" itself comes from the Latin word "silex," meaning flint or hard stone.
