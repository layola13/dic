refractivities:/ˌriːfrækˈtɪvɪtiz/ | n. | 折射率(复数) | The measure of how much a substance bends light.  It is a dimensionless number. Refractivity is dependent on the wavelength of light and the temperature and pressure of the substance. |  The refractivities of different glasses vary considerably. 不同玻璃的折射率差异很大。|The refractive indices of various materials are listed in the table.各种材料的折射率列在表中。| refractive index, index of refraction | absorptivity


USAGE->
This word is a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "What" does.  Therefore,  verb tenses are not applicable.  Example sentences will demonstrate its usage in different sentence structures.


Simple Sentence:
The experiment measured the refractivities of several liquids.  实验测量了几种液体的折射率。


Compound Sentence:
Researchers determined the refractivities of the samples, and these values were used to identify the materials. 研究人员测定了样品的折射率，并将这些值用于识别材料。


Complex Sentence:
Because the refractivities were significantly different, the scientists concluded that the two substances were not identical. 由于折射率差异很大，科学家们得出结论，这两种物质并不相同。


Passive Voice:
The refractivities were carefully calculated using a precise instrument. 折射率是用精密仪器仔细计算出来的。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "refractivities".  However, related phrases involving "refractive index" are common in scientific contexts.  Examples include:


high refractive index 高折射率
low refractive index 低折射率
measurement of refractive index 折射率测量
