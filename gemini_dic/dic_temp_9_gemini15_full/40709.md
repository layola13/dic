词源:
The word "convertible" comes from the verb "convert," which originates from the Late Latin word *convertire*, meaning "to turn around, turn about, change."  The prefix "con-" means "together" or "thoroughly," and the verb "vertere" means "to turn."  Therefore, "convertible" implies the ability to be thoroughly turned or changed into something else.
