proterandrous:/ˌproʊtərˈændrəs/| adj. |雄性先熟的；雌雄异熟的|  Describing a species in which the individual organisms are initially male and then later become female. This sequential hermaphroditism is a common adaptation in certain species, often influenced by factors like size or resource availability.  |Example:  Clownfish exhibit proterandrous hermaphroditism, with smaller individuals initially functioning as males before transitioning to females if the dominant female dies.  |近义词：protogynous (反义词)|反义词: protogynous|词性: adjective


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The clownfish exhibits proterandrous hermaphroditism. = 小丑鱼表现出雄性先熟的雌雄同体现象。
This species is proterandrous. = 这个物种是雄性先熟的。


一般过去时:
The researchers observed proterandrous development in the sample. = 研究人员在样本中观察到雄性先熟的发育。
The study confirmed that the species was proterandrous. = 研究证实该物种是雄性先熟的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have documented many examples of proterandrous species. = 科学家已经记录了许多雄性先熟物种的例子。
Researchers have observed proterandrous hermaphroditism in various coral reef fishes. = 研究人员在各种珊瑚礁鱼类中观察到雄性先熟的雌雄同体现象。


过去完成时:
Before the dominant female died, the male had already experienced proterandrous changes. = 在优势雌性死亡之前，雄性已经经历了雄性先熟的变化。
They had already known that the species was proterandrous before conducting the experiment. = 在进行实验之前，他们就已经知道该物种是雄性先熟的。


将来时:
This individual will likely become female as it grows larger, exhibiting proterandrous characteristics. = 这个个体随着长大可能会变成雌性，表现出雄性先熟的特征。
We will further investigate the genetic mechanisms underlying proterandrous hermaphroditism. = 我们将进一步研究雄性先熟的雌雄同体现象背后的遗传机制。


虚拟语气:
If the dominant female were to die, the largest male would transition to female, demonstrating a proterandrous life history. = 如果优势雌性死亡，最大的雄性将转变为雌性，这展示了一种雄性先熟的生活史。
It would be interesting to study more examples of proterandrous hermaphroditism in other species. = 研究其他物种中更多雄性先熟的雌雄同体现象将很有趣。


被动语态:
Proterandrous hermaphroditism was observed in the studied population. = 在所研究的种群中观察到雄性先熟的雌雄同体现象。
The phenomenon of proterandrous sex change is being extensively researched. = 雄性先熟的性别转变现象正在被广泛研究。


疑问句:
Is this species proterandrous or protogynous? = 这个物种是雄性先熟还是雌性先熟？
Are there any environmental factors that influence proterandrous development? = 有任何环境因素会影响雄性先熟的发育吗？


否定句:
This species is not proterandrous; it is protogynous. = 这个物种不是雄性先熟的；它是雌性先熟的。
The observed sex change was not consistent with typical proterandrous development. = 观察到的性别转变与典型的雄性先熟发育不符。


PHRASE->
proterandrous hermaphrodite = 雄性先熟的雌雄同体
proterandrous sex change = 雄性先熟的性别转变
proterandrous species = 雄性先熟物种
sequential hermaphroditism (includes proterandry) = 顺序性雌雄同体（包括雄性先熟）
proterandrous development = 雄性先熟发育
