pupiparous:/ˈpjuːpɪpærəs/ | adj. | 蛹生的；卵胎生的 | Relating to or characterized by pupiparity, the condition in which insects give birth to live young that are already in the pupal stage.  | Example:  The parasitic fly is pupiparous, meaning it gives birth to live pupae rather than laying eggs.  蛹生的寄生蝇产下的是活蛹而不是卵。 | 近义词: ovoviviparous (卵胎生的，但指幼虫阶段而非蛹) | 反义词: oviparous (卵生的)
