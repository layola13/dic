词源:  The word "puckfist" is a compound word.  "Puck" in this context likely derives from the Old English word "puca," meaning "goblin" or "evil spirit."  This suggests a connection to the mischievous and stingy nature often associated with goblins. "Fist" refers to the clenched hand, suggesting a tight grip on one's money.  The exact etymological path is difficult to definitively trace, as it appears to be a relatively informal and somewhat obscure term, lacking a direct entry in major etymological dictionaries.  However, the implied meaning clearly links the image of a tightly-closed fist with miserliness.
