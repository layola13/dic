cosurfactant:/ˌkoʊˈsɜːrfæktənt/| n. |助表面活性剂|A cosurfactant is a substance added to a surfactant solution to modify its properties, often improving its performance in a specific application.  Cosurfactants typically have a lower HLB (hydrophilic-lipophilic balance) than the main surfactant and can enhance the surfactant's ability to solubilize oils or reduce interfacial tension. |Example:  The addition of a cosurfactant to the surfactant solution improved the stability of the emulsion.  添加助表面活性剂到表面活性剂溶液中提高了乳液的稳定性。|近义词：secondary surfactant, adjuvant|反义词：primary surfactant


USAGE->
