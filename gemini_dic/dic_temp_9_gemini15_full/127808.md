词源:
The phrase originates from a 16th-century proverb, reflecting the difficulty of classifying something that doesn't clearly belong to any established category.  The imagery of "fish" and "fowl" represents distinct and easily identifiable groups.  Therefore, something that is "neither fish nor fowl" is inherently ambiguous and difficult to categorize.
