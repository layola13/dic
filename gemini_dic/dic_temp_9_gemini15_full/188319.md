词源:
The term "rubberneck" is believed to have originated in the late 19th or early 20th century.  The "rubber" part refers to the act of rapidly and repeatedly turning one's neck, similar to the way a rubber band stretches and snaps back.  The term likely evolved from the common sight of people craning their necks to see something interesting or unusual.
