词源:  The word "chicaning" derives from the Spanish word "chicana," meaning "trickery" or "fraud."  This term, in turn, has roots in the Latin word "cicuta," referring to poison hemlock, suggesting something deceptive and potentially harmful.  The transition from "cicuta" to "chicana" involved semantic shifts through various Romance languages before reaching English.
