词源:
The word "cuckoldry" ultimately derives from the Old French word "cocu," meaning "cuckoo."  The cuckoo bird is known for its habit of laying its eggs in the nests of other birds, and this behavior became a metaphor for a husband whose wife is unfaithful, with the husband unknowingly raising another man's child.  The suffix "-ry" indicates a state, condition, or practice.
