词源:  From Late Latin *sinicus "Chinese," from Greek Sīnikós, from Sinae "China."  The word initially referred to things perceived as characteristic of China. Over time, its meaning shifted to describe a cynical or distrustful attitude, possibly due to misinterpretations or stereotypes associated with Chinese culture during periods of Western contact. The exact semantic shift remains debated among etymologists.
