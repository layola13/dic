词源:
The word "impressed" comes from the verb "impress," which ultimately derives from the Latin verb "imprimere," meaning "to press in, stamp, engrave."  The prefix "im-" means "in" or "on," and "-press" relates to the action of pressing. Over time, the meaning evolved to include the sense of making a strong impression or leaving a lasting impact on someone's mind.
