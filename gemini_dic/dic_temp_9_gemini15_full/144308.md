The term "outsporting" is not a standard or widely used word in English.  It appears to be a relatively new or niche term, possibly coined to describe activities that push beyond conventional definitions of sport.  There is no established etymology or comprehensive dictionary entry for this word.  The term is likely formed by combining "out" (suggesting something beyond or exceeding) and "sporting" (referring to athletic activities).


Because of its limited usage, providing examples across all grammatical tenses and moods is not feasible. The word primarily functions as an adjective.
