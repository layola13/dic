exoton: /ˈɛksoʊtɒn/ | n. | 外显子 | An exoton is a hypothetical particle that is emitted during the decay of an excited atom or molecule.  It carries away the excess energy of the excited state, leaving the atom or molecule in its ground state.  The concept is largely theoretical and is not currently widely accepted or experimentally verified.  Further research is needed to confirm its existence and properties. | The theoretical emission of an exoton could explain certain anomalies in atomic and molecular spectroscopy. | 近义词: (No widely accepted direct synonyms as the concept is theoretical.) | 反义词: (No widely accepted direct antonyms as the concept is theoretical.)


USAGE->
(The word "exoton" is not a commonly used word and therefore doesn't have standard grammatical usage examples in the way "what" does. The following examples illustrate hypothetical usage based on the definition.)

一般现在时:
The excited atom emits an exoton. = 受激原子发射出一个外显子。
An exoton carries away excess energy. = 外显子带走多余的能量。

一般过去时:
The experiment detected an exoton. = 实验探测到一个外显子。
The atom released an exoton and returned to its ground state. = 原子释放出一个外显子并回到基态。

现在完成时:
Scientists have theorized about exotons. = 科学家们已经对外显子进行了理论研究。
No one has yet observed an exoton directly. = 还没有人直接观察到外显子。

过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had predicted exoton emission. = 在实验之前，他们已经预测了外显子的发射。
They had hoped to observe an exoton, but failed. = 他们曾希望观察到外显子，但失败了。

将来时:
Researchers will continue to study exotons. = 研究人员将继续研究外显子。
We will hopefully detect an exoton in the next experiment. = 我们希望在接下来的实验中探测到外显子。

虚拟语气:
If exotons existed, it would revolutionize physics. = 如果外显子存在，它将彻底改变物理学。
I wish we could observe an exoton in the lab. = 我希望我们能够在实验室里观察到外显子。

被动语态:
Exotons are hypothesized to be massless. = 假设外显子是无质量的。
The existence of exotons is still being debated. = 外显子的存在仍在争论中。

疑问句:
Could exotons explain this anomaly? = 外显子能解释这种异常现象吗？
What are the properties of an exoton? = 外显子的特性是什么？

否定句:
No direct evidence for exotons has been found. = 没有发现外显子的直接证据。
They did not detect any exotons in their experiment. = 他们在实验中没有探测到任何外显子。


PHRASE->
(Phrases using "exoton" are currently non-existent due to the theoretical nature of the particle.  Any phrases would be highly speculative and context-dependent)
