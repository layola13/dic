photorespiration:/ˌfoʊtoʊˌrɛspəˈreɪʃən/| n. |光呼吸|A metabolic process in plants that occurs in the presence of light and consumes oxygen while releasing carbon dioxide.  It is considered wasteful because it competes with photosynthesis and reduces the efficiency of carbon fixation. |Example: Photorespiration is a process that reduces the efficiency of photosynthesis in C3 plants.  光呼吸是一个降低C3植物光合作用效率的过程。|近义词：oxygenation, oxidative phosphorylation (in a broader context)|反义词：photosynthesis|名词
