词源:
The word "desiredness" is derived from the adjective "desired," which comes from the verb "desire."  "Desire" ultimately traces back to the Old French word "desirer," and further back to the Latin word "desiderare," meaning "to long for," "to wish for," or "to want."  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
