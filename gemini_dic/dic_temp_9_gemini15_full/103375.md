The word "jingliest" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a nonce word (a word coined for a specific occasion), or a word from a very specialized or informal context.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, more context is needed where you encountered this word.
