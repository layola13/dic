interstratified:/ˌɪntərˈstrætɪfaɪd/| adj.|层间互层的，夹层的| Composed of layers of different materials or substances intermingled or layered one upon another.  The term typically describes geological formations where different rock types are interspersed. |例句：The sedimentary rock formation showed a complex interstratified sequence of sandstone and shale.  该沉积岩层显示出砂岩和页岩复杂的层间互层序列。

The interstratified layers of volcanic ash and sediment provided valuable clues about the ancient environment.  火山灰和沉积物的互层提供了关于古代环境的宝贵线索。|近义词：interbedded, intercalated, mingled|反义词：homogeneous, uniform

PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "interstratified".  The word is primarily used in geological contexts as a descriptive adjective.  Phrases would be built around it, for example:

highly interstratified deposits  高度互层的沉积物
complexly interstratified strata 复杂互层的地层
well-defined interstratified layers  清晰界定的互层
partially interstratified sediments 部分互层的沉积物
finely interstratified sandstone and shale  细粒互层的砂岩和页岩
