词源:
The word "glitch" likely originated in the early to mid-20th century. While its exact etymology is uncertain, it is believed to be of German or Yiddish origin, possibly related to words with meanings such as "to slip" or "to slide." Its use broadened from a general sense of a minor mishap or irregularity to its modern technical context in the late 20th century, particularly with the rise of computers and electronics.
