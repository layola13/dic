词源:

The word "decivilized" is formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "to deprive of," "to remove," or "to reverse") to the adjective "civilized."  "Civilized" itself comes from the Late Latin word *civilis*, meaning "of or pertaining to a citizen," ultimately deriving from the Latin word *civis*, meaning "citizen."  Thus, "decivilized" literally means "deprived of civilization" or "having lost the qualities of a citizen in a civilized society."
