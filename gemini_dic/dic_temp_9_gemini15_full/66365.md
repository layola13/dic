词源:
The word "excused" comes from the Old French word "escusé," which is the past participle of the verb "escusser," meaning "to excuse."  This ultimately derives from the Latin word "excusare," composed of "ex-" (out, from) and "causare" (to plead, allege).  Therefore, the root meaning implies removing oneself from a cause or blame.
