词源:
The word "overidealized" is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to a greater extent than is necessary or desirable) and "idealized" (from "ideal," meaning a perfect example or standard, and "-ized," a suffix forming verbs and adjectives).  Therefore, it describes something that has been made too perfect or too much of an ideal.
