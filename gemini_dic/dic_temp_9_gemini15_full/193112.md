词源:  The word "secularist" derives from the Latin word "saecularis," meaning "worldly," "temporal," or "of this age," as opposed to "sacred" or "religious."  The suffix "-ist" indicates a person who adheres to a particular belief or practice.  The evolution of the word reflects the growing separation of religious and state affairs in modern society.
