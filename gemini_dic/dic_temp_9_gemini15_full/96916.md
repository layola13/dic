* **explicable:**  adjective meaning "able to be explained"  This comes from "explain" (verb) + "-able" (suffix)
* **-ness:** a suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition
* **-es:** a plural suffix for nouns


Therefore, "inexplicablenesses" means "the state or quality of being not explainable,"  or more simply, "things that cannot be explained."
