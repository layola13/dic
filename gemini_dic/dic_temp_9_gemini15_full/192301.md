词源:

The word "screwiest" derives from "screwy," which itself is an informal adjective ultimately rooted in the noun "screw."  The connection lies in the image of something being "loose" or "askew," like a loose screw. This sense of being improperly fastened or functioning erratically led to the figurative meaning of being strange, eccentric, or crazy.


用法说明:

"Screwiest" is an informal and often humorous adjective used to describe something or someone that is extremely unusual, odd, or unconventional. It carries a connotation of amusement or bewilderment rather than serious disapproval.  It's generally used in spoken English and informal writing.  Because it's a superlative, it implies a comparison – this thing is the *most* screwy among a set of screwy things.
