preinitiation:/ˌpriːɪnɪʃiˈeɪʃən/| n. |预起始，预启动|The process that prepares for the initiation of transcription or translation.  It involves the assembly of the necessary factors at the promoter region of a gene before the actual initiation of RNA synthesis. |Example:  The preinitiation complex is crucial for the accurate and efficient transcription of genes.|近义词：preparation, preliminary stage|反义词：termination, completion


USAGE->
一般现在时:

将来时:
Researchers will study the preinitiation process further. = 研究人员将进一步研究预起始过程。
The experiment will show the effects on preinitiation. = 实验将显示对预起始的影响。


虚拟语气:
If the preinitiation complex were disrupted, transcription would fail. = 如果预起始复合物被破坏，转录就会失败。
I wish I had understood the preinitiation complex better. = 我真希望我更好地理解预起始复合物。


被动语态:
The preinitiation complex is formed by several proteins. = 预起始复合物是由几种蛋白质形成的。
The preinitiation steps are carefully regulated. = 预起始步骤受到严格调控。


疑问句:
What factors are involved in preinitiation? = 预起始涉及哪些因素？
