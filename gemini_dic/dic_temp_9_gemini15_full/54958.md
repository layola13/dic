词源：
The word "disprivilege" is a relatively recent addition to the English language, formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") to the noun "privilege."  The emergence of this word reflects a growing awareness and understanding of systemic inequalities and the need for a term to specifically address the lack of privilege.
