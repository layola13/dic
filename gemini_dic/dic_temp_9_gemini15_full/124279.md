词源:

The word is a compound of "moth" and "eaten," directly reflecting the damage caused by moths feeding on fabric.  "Moth" comes from Old English *mōþe, while "eaten" is the past participle of the verb "to eat."  The combination creates a descriptive adjective highlighting the effect of moth activity.
