词源:

The word "quincuncial" derives from the Latin word "quincunx," which itself is a combination of "quinque" (five) and "uncia" (a twelfth).  In ancient Roman times, a quincunx was a Roman coin worth five twelfths of an as (a bronze coin). The visual representation of the coin's value, with five units arranged in a pattern resembling a five-spot pattern on a die or the arrangement of five dots on a domino, contributed to the broader usage of the word to describe that pattern.  The adjective "quincuncial" simply adds the adjectival suffix "-al" to describe something having this pattern.
