词源:
The word "gamble" ultimately derives from Old French "gambler," meaning "to hobble or limp."  This is believed to have evolved from the idea of a person who is financially unsteady or "limping" along due to their gambling habits.  The modern meaning of "to gamble" developed over time, moving away from the original physical meaning of "hobbling" to embrace the element of risk and chance associated with games of chance.
