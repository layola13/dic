nonsingularities:/ˌnɒnˌsɪŋɡjʊˈlærətiz/ | n. | 非奇异性，非单一性 | The absence of singularities; the state of being non-singular.  This term is primarily used in mathematical contexts, particularly in areas like linear algebra and differential geometry, referring to matrices, functions, or points that do not exhibit singular behavior (e.g., a matrix that has a non-zero determinant). | Example: The theorem guarantees the nonsingularities of the solution under certain conditions.  该定理保证在特定条件下解的非奇异性。| 近义词:regularity, non-degeneracy | 反义词:singularity, degeneracy | 名词
