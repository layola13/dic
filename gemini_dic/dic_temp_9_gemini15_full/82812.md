词源:
The word "guitar" ultimately derives from the Greek word  κίθαρις (kitharis), referring to a type of ancient Greek lyre.  Through various linguistic evolutions and borrowings (including Arabic and Spanish), the word evolved into its modern form.  The evolution involved changes in pronunciation and spelling across different languages before settling into its current English form.
