non-serial: /ˌnɒnˈsɪəriəl/ | adj. | 非序列的，非连续的 | Not arranged in a series or sequence; not occurring in a regular or continuous series.  | Example: The data was received in a non-serial manner, making analysis difficult.  数据以非连续的方式接收，使得分析变得困难。 |近义词：unsequenced, discontinuous, sporadic | 反义词：serial, sequential, consecutive


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The system operates in a non-serial fashion. = 系统以非序列方式运行。
This process is not non-serial; it follows a clear order. = 这个过程不是非序列的；它遵循一个清晰的顺序。


一般过去时:
The data was processed in a non-serial manner. = 数据以非序列方式处理。
The program ran non-serially, causing unexpected delays. = 程序非连续运行，导致意外延误。


现在完成时:
The researchers have observed several non-serial events. = 研究人员已经观察到几个非连续事件。
We have established that the algorithm is indeed non-serial. = 我们已经确定该算法确实是无序的。


过去完成时:
They had encountered several non-serial data streams before the error occurred. = 在错误发生之前，他们已经遇到过几个非连续的数据流。
The system had run non-serially for hours before crashing. = 系统非连续运行数小时后才崩溃。


将来时:
The new software will process the data non-serially. = 新软件将以非序列方式处理数据。
The team will implement a non-serial approach to this problem. = 团队将对这个问题采用非序列的方法。


虚拟语气:
If the data were non-serial, the analysis would be more complex. = 如果数据是非序列的，分析将更加复杂。
It would be helpful if the system could handle non-serial input. = 如果系统能够处理非序列输入，那将很有帮助。


被动语态:
The data is processed non-serially by the system. = 数据由系统以非序列方式处理。
A non-serial approach was adopted for the project. = 该项目采用了非序列的方法。


疑问句:
Is the data stream non-serial? = 数据流是非序列的吗？
Does this algorithm operate non-serially? = 此算法是否非连续运行？


否定句:
The data is not non-serial; it's perfectly ordered. = 数据不是非序列的；它是完全有序的。
The system does not process data non-serially. = 系统不以非序列方式处理数据。


PHRASE->
non-serial processing = 非序列处理
non-serial communication = 非序列通信
non-serial data structure = 非序列数据结构
non-serial algorithm = 非序列算法
non-serial operation = 非序列操作
