词源:The word "gentlemanlike" is a compound word formed from "gentleman" and the suffix "-like."  "Gentleman" itself evolved from the Old French "gentilhomme," meaning "nobleman." The "-like" suffix indicates resemblance or similarity.  Thus, "gentlemanlike" means "resembling or having the qualities of a gentleman."
