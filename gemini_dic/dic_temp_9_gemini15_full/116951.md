The word "mazing" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is not possible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a particular dialect or context.

If it's a misspelling, it might be intended as one of the following:


* **Amazing:** /əˈmeɪzɪŋ/ | adj. |令人惊奇的，令人赞叹的 | Extremely surprising or impressive; wonderful. | Example: The magician performed an amazing trick.  魔术师表演了一个令人惊奇的魔术。 | Synonyms: astounding, astonishing, marvelous, spectacular | Antonyms: boring, mundane, ordinary


* **Mazing:** (Potentially a misspelling or informal variant of "maze-like")  This would describe something resembling a maze in complexity or structure.  There's no standard definition for this.


To provide the requested information, I'll focus on "amazing" assuming it's the intended word:
