The word "calyon" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* It's a proper noun (a name, place, etc.).
* It's a neologism (a newly coined word) not yet widely used.
* It's a word from a specific dialect or jargon.

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you can.
