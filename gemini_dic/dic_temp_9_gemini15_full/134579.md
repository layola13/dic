The word "nonlogics" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and comprehensive grammatical breakdown are impossible.  The term seems to be a neologism, possibly formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") and "logics" (a plural form suggesting a system or set of principles of logic).
