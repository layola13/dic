mineralization:/ˌmɪnərəlaɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. |矿化作用；矿化；矿物化 |The process by which minerals are formed in rocks or other materials.  This can involve the precipitation of minerals from solution, the alteration of existing minerals, or the replacement of one mineral by another.  It's a crucial geological process that forms many valuable ore deposits. |例句：The mineralization of the bones was evident in the X-ray.  X光片显示骨骼矿化作用明显。

The extensive mineralization in this area suggests a rich history of hydrothermal activity. 这个地区的广泛矿化作用表明这里曾经有丰富的热液活动。|近义词：petrification, lithification |反义词：demineralization
