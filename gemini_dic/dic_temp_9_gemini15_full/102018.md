/ˈaɪsəɡlɒsɪz/ | n. | 等值线，等语线 | Lines on a map connecting points at which a particular linguistic feature has the same value.  Isoglosses mark boundaries between dialects or languages and show the geographical distribution of linguistic features.  They are often used in dialectology to illustrate the variation in language across a region. | The isoglosses on this map show the different pronunciations of the word "bath" across England.  | 近义词：dialect boundary, linguistic boundary | 反义词：None specifically, but the absence of isoglosses could imply a lack of dialectal variation. | 名词
