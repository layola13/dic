词源:
The word "outwalking" is a relatively modern term, a combination of the preposition "out" (indicating outside or away from a place) and the gerund "walking" (the act of walking).  It emphasizes the outdoor aspect of the activity.  There's no ancient or etymologically complex history to unpack for this word; it's a straightforward compounding.
