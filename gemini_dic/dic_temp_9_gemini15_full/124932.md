The word "{mueres}" is not a valid English word.  It appears to be a misspelling or a word from another language (possibly Spanish, where "mueres" is the second-person singular form of the verb "morir," meaning "you die").  Therefore, a complete analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  To provide such an analysis, please provide a valid English word.
