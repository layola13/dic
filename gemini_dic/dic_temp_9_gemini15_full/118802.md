metameric:/ˌmɛtəˈmɛrɪk/ | adj. | 同分异构的，同功的 |  Relating to or denoting isomerism in which molecules have the same number and kind of atoms but differ in their arrangement.  This term is primarily used in chemistry and biology. In chemistry, it refers to isomers that have the same molecular formula but different arrangements of atoms. In biology, it can refer to body segments that are similar in structure but may have different functions. | Example:  "The two compounds are metameric, having the same chemical formula but different structures." = 这两种化合物是同分异构体，具有相同的化学式，但结构不同。  |近义词：isomeric (in chemistry)| 反义词：identical (in structure)


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The two compounds are metameric. = 这两种化合物是同分异构的。
This body segment is metameric to the one below it. = 这节体段与下面的那节体段同功。


一般过去时:
The scientists found that the two substances were metameric. = 科学家发现这两种物质是同分异构的。
The biologist observed that the segments were metameric. = 生物学家观察到这些节段是同功的。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several metameric compounds. = 研究人员已经鉴定了几种同分异构化合物。
We have learned that many insects exhibit metameric segmentation. = 我们已经了解到许多昆虫都表现出同功分节现象。


过去完成时:
They had already determined that the molecules were metameric before the experiment began. = 实验开始之前，他们就已经确定这些分子是同分异构的。
Scientists had previously identified the metameric nature of this organism’s body plan. = 科学家先前已经确定了这种生物体结构的同功性质。


将来时:
Further research will reveal more metameric variations. = 进一步的研究将揭示更多同分异构体的变异。
We will examine the metameric segments of the worm under a microscope. = 我们将在显微镜下检查蠕虫的同功节段。


虚拟语气:
If these molecules were metameric, they would have different properties. = 如果这些分子是同分异构的，它们将具有不同的性质。
If the segments were truly metameric, we would expect to see similar structures. = 如果这些节段确实是同功的，我们预计会看到相似的结构。


被动语态:
Many metameric compounds have been synthesized. = 许多同分异构化合物已被合成。
The metameric segmentation of the animal was clearly observed. = 该动物的同功分节现象被清楚地观察到。


疑问句:
Are these molecules metameric? = 这些分子是同分异构的吗？
Are the body segments metameric in this species? = 在这个物种中，身体节段是同功的吗？


否定句:
The two substances are not metameric; they are identical. = 这两种物质不是同分异构的；它们是相同的。
The segments are not metameric; they have distinct functions. = 这些节段不是同功的；它们具有不同的功能。


PHRASE->
Metameric segmentation = 同功分节
Metameric isomerism = 同分异构现象
Metameric pairs = 同分异构对
Metameric repetition = 同功重复
Chemical metamers = 化学同分异构体
