词源:
The word "malevolently" is derived from the Latin word "malevolens," which is a combination of "male" (bad, ill) and "volens" (wishing).  Therefore, it literally means "wishing ill."  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective "malevolent" into an adverb, indicating the manner in which an action is performed.
