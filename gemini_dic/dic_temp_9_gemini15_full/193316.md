The word "seerhand" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a newly coined word, or a word from a very specialized or fictional context.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are not possible.  To provide you with a helpful response, I need more information about where you encountered this word.  

If you can provide context (e.g., the sentence it appeared in, the book or website where you saw it), I might be able to offer a possible interpretation or suggest a likely intended word.
