词源:
The word "ease" originates from Old English "ēase," meaning "comfort, rest, quiet."  This ultimately derives from Proto-Germanic *ausa- and further back to Proto-Indo-European *h₂ews-, meaning "dawn, east," suggesting a possible connection to the idea of calm and tranquility associated with the beginning of the day.
