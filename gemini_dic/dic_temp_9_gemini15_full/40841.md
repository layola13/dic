/kənˈvʌlsɪvnəsɪz/ | n. | 抽搐的次数；痉挛的发生；震动的情况 | The word "convulsivenesses" is a relatively rare and unusual word, formed by adding the plural suffix "-es" to the already somewhat unusual "convulsiveness."  It attempts to describe multiple instances or occurrences of convulsiveness, which itself refers to the state or quality of being convulsive (characterized by convulsions or spasms).  The word is grammatically correct but stylistically awkward and generally avoided in favor of clearer alternatives. | The numerous convulsivenesses of the earthquake caused widespread damage.  地震的多次剧烈震动造成了广泛的破坏。 The doctor noted the increasing frequency of the patient's convulsivenesses. 医生注意到病人抽搐的次数越来越频繁。 |  spasms, fits, seizures, tremors | calmness, tranquility, stillness | n.
