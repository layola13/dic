词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "sequestered."  "Sequestered" originates from the Middle English word "sequestren," derived from the Old French "sequester," ultimately from the Latin "sequester" (meaning "to separate," "to set apart").  Therefore, "nonsequestered" literally means "not set apart" or "not separated."
