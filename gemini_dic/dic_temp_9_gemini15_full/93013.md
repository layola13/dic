词源:
The word "idiot" comes from the Ancient Greek word "ἰδιώτης" (idiōtēs), meaning "private person," "layman," or "non-professional."  In ancient Greece, the term referred to someone who was not involved in public life, lacking expertise in a particular field.  Over time, the meaning shifted to its modern connotation of someone lacking intelligence.
