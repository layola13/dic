nondegeneratenesses:/ˌnɒnˌdɪdʒɛnəˈreɪtənəsɪz/| n. |非退化性；非简并性|The plural form of "nondegeneracy," referring to the state or quality of not being degenerate.  It often describes mathematical or physical systems that lack certain symmetries or special properties that lead to simplification or reduction in complexity.  For example, in linear algebra, a nondegenerate bilinear form is one that maps to zero only when at least one of its arguments is zero.  In quantum mechanics, nondegenerate energy levels mean that there's only one quantum state associated with a specific energy value.|The study focused on the nondegeneratenesses of the energy levels in the quantum system.|近义词: nonsingularity, independence|反义词: degeneracy, singularity
