词源:
The word "chambermaid" is a compound word.  "Chamber" comes from Old French "chambre," meaning "room," ultimately from Latin "camera," meaning "vaulted room." "Maid" comes from Old English "mægden," meaning "virgin, maiden."  Therefore, a chambermaid is literally a "maid of a room,"  a female servant responsible for cleaning and maintaining rooms.
