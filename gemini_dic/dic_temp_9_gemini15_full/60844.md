electrotonic: /ˌɪˌlɛkˈtroʊtɑːnɪk/ | adj. | 电紧张的；电紧张传导的 | Relating to or denoting the passive spread of electrical potential along a nerve or muscle fiber.  This spread is decremental, meaning the signal weakens with distance.  It's distinct from active propagation of an action potential, which is self-regenerating. |例句：Electrotonic spread of the signal allowed for communication between adjacent neurons even without an action potential. 电紧张传导信号允许相邻神经元即使没有动作电位也能进行通讯。

The electrotonic potential is passively conducted and decays over distance. 电紧张电位是被动传导的，并且会随着距离衰减。| 近义词：passive, decremental | 反义词：active, propagating

词源:
The word "electrotonic" is a combination of "electro-" (relating to electricity) and "-tonic" (relating to tension or tone).  The term describes the passive electrical changes in tension or potential across a membrane.
