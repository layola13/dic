词源:

The word "handcuffs" is a compound word. It combines "hand," referring to the part of the body where the restraints are applied, and "cuffs," a shortened form of "cuff," which originally referred to a band or fastening around the wrist.  The "cuff" element ultimately derives from the Old French word "cuf," meaning "a blow, a cuff."  The association with wrist restraints developed later.
