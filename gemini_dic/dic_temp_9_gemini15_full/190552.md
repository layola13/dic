词源:  From the noun "satire," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "satura," meaning "a medley," "miscellany," or "full dish."  The original meaning encompassed a variety of literary forms, but it evolved to specifically refer to the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize folly, vice, or societal ills.
