chippier:/ˈtʃɪpiər/| adj.|更快乐的；更活泼的；更自信的 |More cheerful, lively, or confident.  The word suggests a slight increase in cheerfulness or energy.|例句：After a good night's sleep, she felt much chippier.  睡了个好觉后，她感觉精神多了。

近义词：cheery, brighter, more cheerful, livelier, perkier

反义词：depressed, glum, downcast, morose, despondent

词源:源自形容词chipper，意为“快乐的，活泼的”。"-ier"是比较级后缀，表示程度的加深。  The word ultimately derives from an obsolete word meaning "to chop," suggesting a brisk and lively energy.  However, the exact semantic link is unclear, and the modern meaning is unrelated to the original chopping sense.
