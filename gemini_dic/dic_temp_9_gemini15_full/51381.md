determinant-ranks:/dɪˈtɜːrmɪnənt ræŋks/| n.|行列式秩|Determinant ranks refer to the ranks of matrices obtained from the determinant of a matrix or a system of matrices.  In linear algebra, the rank of a matrix is the dimension of the vector space generated (or spanned) by its columns (or rows).  The determinant-ranks are relevant in various contexts, particularly when analyzing the linear dependence or independence of sets of vectors and solving systems of linear equations. The determinant itself plays a key role in determining the rank, as a non-zero determinant implies full rank (the rank equals the number of columns/rows).|例句：The determinant-ranks of the coefficient matrix determine the solvability of the linear system. 行列式秩决定了线性方程组的可解性。The analysis of the determinant-ranks provided insights into the underlying structure of the data. 行列式秩的分析为了解数据的底层结构提供了见解。|近义词：matrix ranks, linear dependence/independence|反义词：N/A
