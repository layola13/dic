词源:  The word "designment" is derived from the verb "design" + the suffix "-ment," which indicates a result or product of an action.  The suffix "-ment" is of French origin.  Therefore, the word's etymology traces back to the Old French word "desegner" and ultimately to the Latin word "designare," meaning "to mark out, designate, point out."

注意事项：虽然“designment”在字典中可以查到，但它比“design”使用频率低得多。在现代英语中，通常直接使用“design”来指代设计方案、计划等，而很少使用“designment”。  因此，在写作中，除非有特定的语境需要强调“设计的结果”或者“设计行为”，否则建议使用更常用的“design”。
