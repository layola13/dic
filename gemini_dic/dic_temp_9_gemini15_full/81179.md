词源:
The term "grandfathered" originates from the practice of allowing older members of a family or group to maintain their privileges or status even when new rules or regulations are implemented.  This is analogous to a grandfather passing down rights or privileges to his descendants.  The term's usage extended metaphorically to apply to non-familial contexts.
