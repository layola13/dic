Etymology:

The word "pinnacle" ultimately derives from the Old French word "pinacle," which itself comes from the Late Latin "pinnaculum." This Latin word is a diminutive of "pinna," meaning "feather" or "wing," likely referring to the resemblance of a pinnacle's shape to a pointed feather or wing.  The evolution reflects a visual metaphor connecting the pointed shape of a mountain peak or architectural feature to a bird's feather.
