mesobronchium: /ˌmɛzoʊˈbrɒŋkiəm/ | n. | 中支气管 |

英文解析:A mesobronchus is a part of the avian respiratory system.  It's a large airway connecting the primary bronchi to the parabronchi, which are the sites of gas exchange in birds.  Unlike mammalian lungs, avian lungs have a unidirectional airflow system facilitated by the mesobronchi and parabronchi.

例句:
The mesobronchus plays a crucial role in the efficient respiratory system of birds. = 中支气管在鸟类高效的呼吸系统中起着至关重要的作用。

The researchers studied the airflow dynamics within the mesobronchus and parabronchi. = 研究人员研究了中支气管和后支气管内的气流动力学。
