/ˈsɪtɔɪd/| n. |拟细胞的，类细胞的 |Resembling a cell, but not a true cell; often used to describe artificial structures that mimic some aspects of cell behavior or morphology.  | Example:  The researchers created cytoid structures that displayed some characteristics of living cells, such as growth and division.  研究人员创造了具有某些活细胞特征（例如生长和分裂）的类细胞结构。|近义词：cell-like, cell-mimicking |反义词：cellular (in the context of being a true cell)


USAGE->

将来时:
We will investigate the potential applications of cytoids in medicine. = 我们将研究类细胞在医学中的潜在应用。
Researchers will likely continue to refine cytoid creation techniques. = 研究人员可能会继续改进类细胞的创建技术。


虚拟语气:
If the cytoid were a true cell, it would have a nucleus. = 如果类细胞是真正的细胞，它就会有细胞核。
It is crucial that the cytoid maintain its structural integrity. = 至关重要的是，类细胞必须保持其结构完整性。


被动语态:
