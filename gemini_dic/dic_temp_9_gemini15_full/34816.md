词源:
The word "clinch" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "clincchen," meaning "to fasten," "to clinch nails," or "to grip firmly." This likely originated from a combination of "clynchen" (to close or fasten) and "clinch" (a bend or hook).  The modern usage evolved from the sense of firmly grasping something, and later extended metaphorically to securing agreements or victories.
