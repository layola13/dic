词源:

The word "draughtsman" comes from the Middle English word "draughtsman," which itself is a combination of "draught" (meaning a sketch or drawing) and "man" (referring to a person).  The word "draught" ultimately derives from the Old English word "draght," meaning "a drawing or pull."  Thus, a draughtsman is literally a "drawing man."
