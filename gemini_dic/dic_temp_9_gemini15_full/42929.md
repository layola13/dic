词源:
The word "covenable" derives from the word "covenant," which comes from the Old French word "covenant" and ultimately from the Latin word "con venire," meaning "to come together."  A covenant is a formal agreement or contract, often involving a solemn promise.  Therefore, "covenable" describes something that is suitable or capable of being included in such an agreement.
