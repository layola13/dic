词源:
The noun "perm" is a shortened form of "permanent wave," referring to a hairstyle created by chemically altering the hair's structure to create curls or waves that last until the hair grows out. The verb "perm" derives from this noun, meaning to give someone a permanent wave.  The word "permanent" itself comes from Old French "permanent," ultimately derived from Latin "permanere" meaning "to remain," "to stay," or "to last."
