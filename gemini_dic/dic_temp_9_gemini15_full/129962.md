non-metal:/ˌnɒnˈmɛtəl/| n. |非金属|A chemical element that is not a metal. Nonmetals are typically poor conductors of heat and electricity, and they tend to be brittle and have low density.  They often exist as gases or brittle solids at room temperature.| Examples include oxygen, carbon, and sulfur.  Nonmetals are often found in organic molecules and play crucial roles in biological processes. |近义词： metalloid (for elements with intermediate properties) |反义词：metal


USAGE->

词源:

The word "non-metal" is a compound word.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," and "metal" refers to a chemical element characterized by its conductivity and other metallic properties.  Therefore, "non-metal" literally means "not a metal."
