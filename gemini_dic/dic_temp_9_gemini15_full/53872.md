discontinuity:/ˌdɪskɒntɪˈnjuːɪti/|/ˌdɪskɑːntɪˈnjuːɪti/| n. |不连续性，间断|A discontinuity is a break or interruption in something that is otherwise continuous.  It refers to a point,  line, or region where a property or function changes abruptly or is undefined. This concept applies across various fields like mathematics, physics, and geology. | Example: The graph showed a clear discontinuity at x=2.  图表在x=2处显示了一个明显的间断。

The geological survey revealed several discontinuities in the rock strata. 地质勘测揭示了岩层中的一些不连续性。|近义词：break, interruption, gap, discontinuity, inconsistency |反义词：continuity, coherence, consistency


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The graph shows a discontinuity. = 图表显示了一个不连续性。
There is a discontinuity in the data. = 数据中存在不连续性。


一般过去时:
A discontinuity occurred in the power supply. = 供电发生了中断。
The experiment revealed a significant discontinuity. = 实验揭示了一个显著的不连续性。


现在完成时:
Scientists have observed many discontinuities in the Earth's crust. = 科学家们已经观测到地球地壳中的许多不连续性。
Several discontinuities have been identified in the signal. = 在信号中已经识别出几个不连续性。


过去完成时:
Before the earthquake, no discontinuities had been detected. = 地震发生前，没有探测到任何不连续性。
The analysis showed that a discontinuity had already existed. = 分析表明，不连续性已经存在。


将来时:
The engineers will address the potential discontinuities in the design. = 工程师们将解决设计中潜在的不连续性。
We anticipate that further discontinuities will be found. = 我们预计会发现进一步的不连续性。


虚拟语气:
If there were no discontinuities, the model would be simpler. = 如果没有不连续性，模型将会更简单。
I wish the data didn't show so many discontinuities. = 我希望数据没有显示这么多不连续性。


被动语态:
The discontinuity was identified by the researchers. = 不连续性被研究人员识别出来。
The problem was caused by a discontinuity in the transmission line. = 问题是由传输线路中的不连续性引起的。


疑问句:
Are there any discontinuities in the function? = 函数中是否存在任何不连续性？
What caused the discontinuity in the signal? = 导致信号不连续的原因是什么？


否定句:
The data showed no discontinuities. = 数据没有显示任何不连续性。
There was no apparent discontinuity in the rock formation. = 岩层形成中没有明显的间断。


PHRASE->
points of discontinuity: 不连续点
line of discontinuity: 不连续线
surface of discontinuity: 不连续面
jump discontinuity: 跳跃间断
removable discontinuity: 可去间断
