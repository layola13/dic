词源：

The term "hot-blooded" is a compound word. "Hot" refers to intense heat or passion, and "blooded" historically related to temperament or disposition, often associated with the belief that blood type influenced personality. While this latter association is now considered outdated, the figurative use of "blooded" to describe temperament persists.  The combination suggests a person whose passions run high.
