/ˈpɒliɡruːps/ | n. |多群,多重群|A polygroup is a generalization of a group in algebra.  It is a set with a multi-valued operation that satisfies certain axioms similar to those of a group, but with the operation being a relation rather than a function.  Specifically,  a polygroup consists of a set G, a distinguished element e (the identity), a multi-valued binary operation denoted by  *, and a unary operation  ⁻¹ (inversion) satisfying several axioms, including the existence of an identity and inverses for each element, but allowing multiple possible "products" for any two elements.  This structure finds applications in various areas of mathematics and computer science, particularly in the study of automata theory and formal languages.|例句：The study of polygroups extends the concepts of group theory to accommodate more complex algebraic structures.|近义词：hypergroup (though not a perfect synonym, as the axioms differ)|反义词：group (in the sense that a group is a simpler, single-valued structure)


USAGE->

This word is highly specialized and doesn't lend itself to common grammatical usage examples like the example word "what".  Its use is primarily within mathematical contexts.  Therefore, providing examples for tense, voice, etc., is not applicable in the same way.


PHRASE->

Phrases involving "polygroup" are highly specialized and within the field of abstract algebra.  There aren't common phrases like those for more general words.
