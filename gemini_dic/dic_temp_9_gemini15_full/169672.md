词源:
The word "proportionless" is formed from the prefix "pro-" (meaning "forth" or "forward"), the noun "portion" (meaning "a part of a whole"), and the suffix "-less" (meaning "without").  Therefore, it literally means "without proper parts or shares," indicating a lack of balanced or harmonious proportions.  The evolution of "portion" from Latin "portio" ("a part, share, or portion") further illuminates the root of the word's meaning.
