词源:
The word "curfew" originates from the Old French word "couvre-feu," which literally translates to "cover fire."  Historically, curfews were implemented to prevent fires from spreading by requiring people to extinguish their fires at a certain time.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the broader concept of a regulation requiring people to remain indoors at night.
