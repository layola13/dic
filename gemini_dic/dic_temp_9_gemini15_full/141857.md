词源:

The word "orchestrator" derives from the word "orchestra," ultimately from the Greek word ὀρχήστρα (orkhḗstra), meaning "dancing place," referring to the area where the chorus and dancers performed in ancient Greek theaters.  The term later came to denote the group of instrumentalists, and eventually the process of coordinating and leading this ensemble became associated with the word, leading to the modern meaning of "orchestrator."
