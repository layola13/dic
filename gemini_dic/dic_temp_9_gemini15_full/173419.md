词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "almost," or "somewhat."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation to something but not a perfect equivalence.

* **entertaining**: From "entertain," ultimately from Old French *entreteignir*,  meaning "to hold between, to keep occupied."  This evolved to include the sense of amusement and diversion.
