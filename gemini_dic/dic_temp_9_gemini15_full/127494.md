词源:
The word "neckerchief" is a compound word.  "Neck" refers to the part of the body, and "kerchief" is an older word meaning a head covering or scarf.  The "kerchief" part comes from the Old French "couvrechef," literally meaning "head covering."  Therefore, a neckerchief is literally a "neck covering."
