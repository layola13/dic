词源:
The word "sicklied" is derived from the Middle English word "sikly," meaning "sickly" or "pale."  It's a past participle form, used as an adjective,  reflecting the influence of the verb "to sickly," though this verb is now largely obsolete.  The root ultimately traces back to Old English "seoc" meaning "sick."
