词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin, meaning "as if," "seemingly," or "almost."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation, but not a complete identity.

* **commercial**: From  "commerce," ultimately from Latin *commercium* ("trade, exchange," from *com-* "together" + *merx, mercis* "merchandise").


用法说明:  "Quasi-commercial" is used as an adjective to describe activities, organizations, or entities that exhibit some characteristics of a commercial enterprise but do not fully conform to the standard definition of a commercial business. This often applies to situations where a profit motive is present, but other non-profit goals (e.g., social impact, research advancement) are equally important.  It's a nuanced term used to describe situations that fall into a grey area between purely commercial and purely non-profit endeavors.
