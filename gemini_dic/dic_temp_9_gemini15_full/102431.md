词源:The word "jackboots" combines "jack," a common term for a common person or a fellow, often implying a lack of refinement, and "boots," referring to footwear that covers the ankle and extends upward.  The combination suggests heavy, clumsy boots worn by common soldiers or those in positions of authority, often implying brutality and oppression.  The precise origin of the term is difficult to pinpoint to a specific date, but its usage became more prevalent in the 20th century, particularly associated with images of Nazi and Fascist regimes.
