phenols:/ˈfiːnɔːlz/| n.|酚类|Phenols are a class of organic compounds characterized by a hydroxyl group (-OH) directly bonded to a benzene ring. They are widely used in various industrial applications, including the production of resins, plastics, and disinfectants.  Many phenols have antiseptic and disinfectant properties.| Example: Carbolic acid, also known as phenol, is a well-known disinfectant.|近义词: aromatic alcohols|反义词:  (no direct antonym, but  compounds lacking a hydroxyl group bonded to an aromatic ring could be considered opposite in structure)|名词

词源:
The word "phenol" is derived from the Greek word "phainein" (φαίνειν), meaning "to shine" or "to appear," and the suffix "-ol," indicating an alcohol.  This refers to the early methods of identification and extraction of phenols, which often involved observing shiny or crystalline substances. The name highlights the aromatic nature of the compound.
