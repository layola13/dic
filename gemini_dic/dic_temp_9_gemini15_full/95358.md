/ɪnˈsɛrətɪv/ | adj. | 鼓励的；激励的；奖励的 | Encouraging; giving an incentive; stimulating to action.  The incerative program successfully boosted employee productivity. |近义词：incentive, motivational, stimulating | 反义词：discouraging, demotivating, inhibiting |


The word "incerative" is not a standard English word.  While it seems to be constructed based on the root "incentive," it's not found in standard dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed etymology and comprehensive usage examples cannot be provided.  The intended meaning appears to be related to "incentive," which is derived from the Latin word *incentare*, meaning "to spur on," "to goad," or "to incite."  This, in turn, comes from *incēnsus*, the past participle of *incendere*, meaning "to set on fire," "to inflame."  The "-ive" suffix in "incentive" creates an adjective, meaning "having the power to incite or encourage."
