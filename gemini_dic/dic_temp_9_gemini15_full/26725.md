词源:
The word "cadger" likely originates from the obsolete word "cadge," meaning "to beg" or "to sponge."  The ultimate origin is uncertain, but some etymologists suggest a possible connection to the Old French word "cager," meaning "to confine" or "to cage," suggesting a sense of being trapped into giving something.  The shift in meaning from confinement to begging is likely due to the association of beggars often being confined to a certain area or lifestyle.
