pyroelectricity:/ˌpaɪroʊɪˌlɛkˈtrɪsəti/| n. |焦电性，热电性 |The ability of certain materials to generate an electric charge in response to a change in temperature.  Pyroelectricity is a property of certain crystals that exhibit a spontaneous polarization that is temperature-dependent. When the temperature of the crystal changes, the spontaneous polarization also changes, resulting in a flow of electric charge.  |Example:  The pyroelectric effect is used in infrared detectors.  焦电效应用于红外探测器。


Example: Some ceramics exhibit strong pyroelectricity.  某些陶瓷表现出强烈的焦电性。|近义词：thermoelectricity |反义词：无
