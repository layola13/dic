词源：

The word "counterpoise" comes from the Old French word "contrepeser," which itself is composed of "contre" (against, counter) and "peser" (to weigh).  The word thus literally means "to weigh against."  This reflects the original meaning of the word as a physical weight used to balance something else on a scale.  Over time, its meaning expanded to include the more abstract sense of balancing opposing forces or influences.
