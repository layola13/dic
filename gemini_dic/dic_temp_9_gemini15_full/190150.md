词源:
The word "sanitize" comes from the word "sanitary," meaning relating to or concerned with sanitation or public health.  "Sanitary" itself ultimately derives from the Latin word "sanitas," meaning "health" or "wholesomeness."  The suffix "-ize" is added to create a verb meaning "to make sanitary."
