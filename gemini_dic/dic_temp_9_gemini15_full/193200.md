词源:
From Latin *sēdītiōsus, from sēdītiō ("sedition").  The Latin word itself comes from *sēd- ("to sit") + -itiō ("act of, state of").  The original meaning refers to a sitting down or settling, often in a rebellious or disruptive manner, which eventually evolved to its current meaning of inciting rebellion.
