The word "readvocating" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  If it was intended to be a combination of "re-" and "advocating," then we can analyze it based on that assumption.


/ˌriːˈædvəkeɪtɪŋ/ | v. | 重新倡导；再次主张 |  To advocate again or anew for something; to reiterate support for a cause or idea. | Example:  The senator is readvocating for stricter gun control laws following the recent tragedy.  = 参议员在最近的悲剧之后再次倡导更严格的枪支管制法。|近义词：reasserting, reaffirming, reiterating | 反义词：opposing, rejecting, repudiating |
