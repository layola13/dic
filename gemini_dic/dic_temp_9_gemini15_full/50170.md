词源:
The word "deodorant" is a combination of the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to deprive of") and the word "odorant" (meaning "something that has a smell").  Therefore, it literally means "something that removes odor".  The word "odorant" itself has roots in the Latin word "odor," meaning "smell."
