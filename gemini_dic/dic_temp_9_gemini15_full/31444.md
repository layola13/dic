词源:

The word "charivari" comes from the French word "charivari," which itself has uncertain origins.  One theory traces it back to the Old French "charivar," possibly related to the medieval French word "chivari," meaning "uproar" or "tumult."  Another theory suggests a possible connection to the Occitan word "carivari," also meaning "noise" or "uproar."  Regardless of its precise etymology, the word ultimately reflects the noisy and chaotic nature of the events it describes.
