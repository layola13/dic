词源:
The word "passenger" comes from the Old French word "passagiere," which means "passer," meaning "to pass" and "-agiere," a suffix denoting  "one who does" something.  Thus, a passenger is literally "one who passes" or "one who travels."  The word entered English during the Middle English period.
