USAGE->
This word is a possessive form and doesn't have verb conjugations like the example word "what".  It shows possession.  Therefore, tense conjugations are not applicable.  Instead, examples will show different ways to use the possessive form.


Example 1:  The doctor's practise's reputation was excellent. 医生诊所的名声极好。
Example 2:  The company's practise's effectiveness was questioned. 公司的经营方式的有效性受到了质疑。
Example 3: Today's practise's results were encouraging. 今天的练习结果令人鼓舞。

PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "practise's".  The word is primarily used as a possessive form within a phrase describing a practice, and further phrasing depends on what is being described.  For example:


Example 1: "The musician's practise's dedication to detail"  (音乐家练习对细节的专注)
Example 2: "The team's practise's rigorous schedule" (团队练习严格的日程安排)
Example 3: "The student's practise's consistent improvement" (学生的练习持续进步)
Example 4: "The lawyer's practise's ethical standards"  (律师事务所的职业道德标准)
Example 5: "The teacher's practise's innovative methods" (老师教学方法的创新)


Note that "practise" (British English) and "practice" (American English) are largely interchangeable, therefore "practice's" would be equally valid.
