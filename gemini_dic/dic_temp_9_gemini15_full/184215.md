resolidification: /ˌriːˌsɒlɪdɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/ | n. | 再凝固；重新固化 | The process by which a substance that has been melted or liquefied becomes solid again.  This often involves a change in the material's structure or properties. | Example: The rapid resolidification of the molten metal resulted in a fine-grained structure.  快速再凝固的熔融金属导致细晶粒结构。 The resolidification of the lava created new volcanic rock formations.  熔岩的再凝固形成了新的火山岩层。 | 近义词: re-solidification, refreezing (in the context of water) | 反义词: melting, liquefaction


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The metal resolidifies quickly. = 金属快速再凝固。
Resolidification occurs when the temperature drops below the freezing point. = 当温度降到冰点以下时，就会发生再凝固。

一般过去时:
The lava resolidified after cooling. = 熔岩冷却后重新凝固。
The water resolidified into ice. = 水重新凝固成冰。

现在完成时:
The liquid has resolidified. = 液体已经重新凝固。
The material has resolidified into a crystalline structure. = 材料已经重新凝固成晶体结构。

过去完成时:
The substance had resolidified before the analysis. = 在分析之前，物质已经重新凝固。
The molten metal had resolidified by the time we arrived. = 当我们到达时，熔融金属已经重新凝固。

将来时:
The mixture will resolidify once the cooling process begins. = 一旦冷却过程开始，混合物就会重新凝固。
The solution will resolidify at a lower temperature. = 该溶液将在较低的温度下重新凝固。

虚拟语气:
If the temperature were lowered, the liquid would resolidify. = 如果降低温度，液体就会重新凝固。
I wish the mixture had resolidified more quickly. = 我希望混合物能更快地重新凝固。

被动语态:
The molten material was resolidified by rapid cooling. = 熔融材料通过快速冷却重新凝固。
The sample is being resolidified in a controlled environment. = 样品正在受控环境中重新凝固。

疑问句:
Does the material resolidify easily? = 该材料容易重新凝固吗？
How quickly does resolidification occur? = 再凝固发生的速度有多快？

否定句:
The liquid did not resolidify completely. = 液体没有完全重新凝固。
The substance will not resolidify without proper cooling. = 没有适当的冷却，物质就不会重新凝固。


PHRASE->
rapid resolidification = 快速再凝固
controlled resolidification = 受控再凝固
directional resolidification = 定向再凝固
solidification rate = 凝固速率
solidification temperature = 凝固温度
