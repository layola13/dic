词源:

The word "inalienably" is derived from the word "alienable," which comes from the Latin word "alienare," meaning "to make strange," "to estrange," or "to transfer."  The prefix "in-" negates the meaning, resulting in "inalienable," meaning "not transferable" or "not able to be alienated."  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective "inalienable" into the adverb "inalienably."
