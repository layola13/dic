词源:
The word "ditzy" is believed to be an American English slang term, likely derived from the word "dizzy," meaning slightly disoriented or lightheaded. The added "-sy" suffix intensifies and somewhat softens the meaning, creating a more playful and less negative connotation.  The exact origin is uncertain and its evolution into a common slang term is not well documented.
