词源:  The word "peltish" derives from the obsolete word "pelt," meaning "skin" or "hide," particularly an animal skin. This older "pelt" is related to the Old English word "pylt," and possibly also to the Old Norse word "pelr." The connection to "peltish" lies in the idea of a rough, untamed, or easily angered hide or animal, mirroring the quick-to-anger disposition described by the adjective.  The "ish" suffix indicates a quality or characteristic.
