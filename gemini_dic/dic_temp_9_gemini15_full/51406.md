The word "determinist" is derived from the Latin word "determinare," meaning "to determine" or "to fix."  The suffix "-ist" indicates a person who believes in or practices something.  Thus, a determinist is someone who believes in determinism, the philosophical doctrine that all events are causally determined by prior events.
