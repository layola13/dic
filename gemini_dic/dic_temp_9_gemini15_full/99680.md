词源:
The word "interlinked" is a combination of the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and the past participle "linked" (from the verb "to link," meaning "to connect").  Therefore, it literally means "connected between or among."  The root of "link" can be traced back to Old English "hlinc," meaning "a fold."
