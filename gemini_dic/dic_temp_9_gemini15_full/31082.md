The word "champas" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible. It's likely a misspelling, a word from a specific dialect or jargon, or a proper noun (like a place name).  To provide an analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (a book, a conversation, a website, etc.)
* **What was the surrounding text or conversation?** This will help determine the intended meaning.


Without further information, I cannot provide the requested phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical analysis.
