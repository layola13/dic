cytoplasm:/ˈsaɪtəʊplæzəm/ | n. |细胞质 |The cytoplasm is the material within a living cell, excluding the nucleus.  It is a complex mixture of cytosol, organelles, and inclusions.  It plays a vital role in many cellular processes, including metabolism, protein synthesis, and cell division. |Example: The ribosomes within the cytoplasm synthesize proteins.  细胞质内的核糖体合成蛋白质。 |近义词: cytosol (部分细胞质) |反义词: nucleus (细胞核)
