词源:  The word "idiosyncrasy" comes from the Greek words  ἴδιος (idios), meaning "own" or "private," and  συγκραισις (sygkrasis), meaning "a mixing together" or "temperament."  The combination originally referred to a peculiar temperament or constitution of a person, eventually evolving to encompass any unique and distinctive characteristic.
