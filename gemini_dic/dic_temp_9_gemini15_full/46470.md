The word "dailiest" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need to consider potential intended words.  It might be a misspelling of words like "daily," "dailies," or perhaps a deliberate alteration for stylistic effect.

If "dailiest" was intended to be the superlative form of "daily," implying "most daily," this would be grammatically incorrect.  "Daily" is an adverb and adjective, and doesn't have a standard comparative or superlative form.  One could say "more often" or "most often" to convey a similar meaning.


If clarification on the intended word is provided, a proper analysis according to the requested format can be given.
