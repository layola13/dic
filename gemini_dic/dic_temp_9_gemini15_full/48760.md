词源:

The word "definitude" is derived from the Latin word "definītus," the past participle of "definīre," meaning "to define," "to limit," or "to determine."  The suffix "-itude" is a common noun suffix in English, often indicating a state, quality, or condition.  Therefore, "definitude" literally means "the state of being defined."
