词源：From French *litre*, from Old French *litron*, from Late Latin *litra*, from Greek *λίτρα* (lítra), "pound", "liter".  The Greek word ultimately derives from an earlier Semitic word, likely Akkadian, denoting a weight unit.  The connection to volume came later, as liquids were often measured by weight.
