ETYMOLOGY->

The term "dog days" originates from the ancient Greeks and Romans. They associated the hottest period of summer with the heliacal rising of Sirius, the brightest star in the constellation Canis Major (the Greater Dog).  Sirius's apparent proximity to the sun during this time was believed to add to the sun's heat, causing the intense summer heat.  The Latin term *caniculares dies* ("days of the dog") became the English phrase "dog days".
