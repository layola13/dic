rearresting: /ˌriːˈrɛstɪŋ/ | adj. | 再次逮捕的；再次吸引人的 | Extremely interesting and captivating;  holding one's attention.  |

英文解析:  The word "rearresting" is formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning again or anew) to the word "arresting."  While "arresting" primarily means to seize or capture someone, it also has a secondary meaning of being strikingly attractive or interesting.
