词源:

The word "hyperfastidiously" is formed by combining the prefix "hyper-" (meaning "excessive" or "beyond") with "fastidiously."  "Fastidiously" derives from the Latin word "fastidium," meaning "disgust," "loathing," or "weariness."  Over time, "fastidious" evolved to describe someone excessively concerned with details and precision, often to the point of being squeamish or difficult to please.  The addition of "hyper-" intensifies this meaning to an extreme degree.
