词源：
The word "hygienically" is derived from the word "hygiene," which itself comes from the Greek word "hygieia" (Ὑγιεία), meaning "health," "healthiness," or "wellness."  The Greek goddess of health was named Hygieia.  The suffix "-ically" is an adverbial suffix indicating "in a manner of" or "in the style of." Therefore, "hygienically" means "in a manner relating to hygiene" or "in a healthy and clean way."
