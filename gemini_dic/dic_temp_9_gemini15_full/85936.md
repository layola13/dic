词源：

The word "headlongness" is derived from the adjective "headlong," which combines "head" and "long."  Originally, "headlong" meant "with the head foremost," implying a rapid, uncontrolled movement. Over time, its meaning shifted to emphasize the reckless or impetuous nature of such actions.  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the quality or state of being headlong.
