词源:

The word "musklike" is a compound word formed from "musk" and the suffix "-like."

* **Musk:** This word originates from the Middle English "musk," borrowed from Old French "musc," ultimately from Arabic "musk."  It refers to a strong-smelling substance obtained from the musk deer.

* **-like:** This suffix is a common English suffix meaning "similar to" or "resembling."  It's of Old English origin.

Therefore, "musklike" literally means "similar to musk" or "resembling musk" in its odor.
