cosmologist:/kɒzˈmɒlədʒɪst/| n. |宇宙学家|A cosmologist is a scientist who studies cosmology, the origin and evolution of the universe.  Cosmologists use observations and theoretical models to understand the universe's structure, composition, and history. They often work with large datasets from telescopes and other instruments.|Example:  The cosmologist presented her findings on the expansion rate of the universe.  宇宙学家展示了她关于宇宙膨胀速度的研究结果。|近义词：astrophysicist, astronomer|反义词：None.
