词源:
The word "dematerialized" is derived from the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove or reverse") and the noun "material" (referring to physical substance).  The suffix "-ized" indicates that something has been made into a particular state.  Therefore, "dematerialized" means to have removed or reversed the material nature of something, rendering it intangible or virtual.
