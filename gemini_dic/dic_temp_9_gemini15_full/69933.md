The word "fery" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "ferry," "fiery," or "furry."

2. **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a place name, a person's name, or a brand name.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.

4. **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.


To help me provide the information you need, please double-check the spelling or provide more context about where you encountered this word.  If you can give me a sentence using "fery," that would be extremely helpful.
