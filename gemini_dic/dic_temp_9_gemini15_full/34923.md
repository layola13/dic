词源:
The word "cloaca" comes from the Latin word "cloaca," meaning "sewer" or "drain."  The Latin word itself is of uncertain origin, possibly related to words meaning "to cleanse" or "to wash."  The biological use of the term, referring to the single opening in certain animals, reflects the functional similarity to a sewer – a place where multiple waste products are channeled and expelled.
