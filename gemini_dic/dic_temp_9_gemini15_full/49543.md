词源:

The word "demasculinizes" is derived from the word "masculine," meaning "having qualities traditionally associated with men." The prefix "de-" indicates removal or reversal. Therefore, "demasculinizes" means to remove or reduce masculine characteristics.  The word ultimately traces back to Latin *masculus ("male").
