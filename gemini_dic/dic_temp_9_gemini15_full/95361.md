词源:  From the Old French *incertitude, from Latin *incertitudo, from incertus "uncertain," from in- "not" + certus "certain, sure."  The Latin root *certus is related to the verb cernere "to separate, distinguish, decide,"  ultimately connecting to the Proto-Indo-European root *ker- "to cut, separate."  Therefore, the word's etymology reflects the idea of a lack of clear separation or decision.
