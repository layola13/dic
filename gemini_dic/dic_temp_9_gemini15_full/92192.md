The word "hypersubtleness" is not a standard dictionary word. It's a newly coined word, formed by combining "hyper-" (meaning "excessive" or "beyond") with "subtlety" (meaning "the quality of being subtle").  Therefore, a detailed etymology beyond this combination isn't available.


USAGE->

This word, being uncommon, doesn't have typical usage examples across different tenses or grammatical structures like "what" does.  Its usage would be limited to describing things with extreme subtlety,  often in a context suggesting that the subtlety is excessive or even hindering understanding.
