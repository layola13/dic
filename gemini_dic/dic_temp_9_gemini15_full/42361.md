词源:
The word "counterassassination" is a compound word.  "Counter" is a prefix meaning "against" or "in opposition to,"  while "assassination" refers to the act of killing someone, typically a prominent person, in a sudden or secret manner.  Therefore, "counterassassination" literally means an assassination carried out in response to another assassination.
