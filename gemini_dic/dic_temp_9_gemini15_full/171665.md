词源:
The word "pulsometer" is a combination of "pulse" and "meter".  "Pulse" comes from the Latin word "pulsus," meaning "a beating," referring to the rhythmic throbbing of arteries. "Meter" comes from the Greek word "metron," meaning "measure." Therefore, pulsometer literally means "a device that measures the pulse."
