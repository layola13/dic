词源:

The word "madwoman" is a compound word.  "Mad" comes from Old English *mǣd, meaning "angry, furious, insane."  "Woman" comes from Old English wīfmann, literally "wife-man," reflecting the historical linguistic gendering of the term.  Therefore, "madwoman" literally means "insane woman".  The word's negative connotations reflect societal attitudes toward mental illness throughout history.
