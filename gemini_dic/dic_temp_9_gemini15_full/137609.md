The word "nontropical" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" and the adjective "tropical".

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of".

* **tropical**:  Derived from the Latin word "tropicus," which in turn comes from the Greek word "tropikos" meaning "of or pertaining to a turning point" referring to the turning of the sun at the tropics.  It describes regions near the equator characterized by high temperatures and heavy rainfall.
