词源:
The word "sidestepped" is a combination of "side" and "step."  "Side" refers to a lateral direction, and "step" indicates a movement of the foot. The verb evolved to describe the act of moving aside to avoid something, and later extended metaphorically to avoiding a difficult topic or responsibility.
