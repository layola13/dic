electromagnetism:/ˌɪˌlɛktrəʊˈmæɡnɪtɪzəm/| n. |电磁学|The branch of physics dealing with the interaction between electricity and magnetism.  Electromagnetism describes how these two forces are different aspects of the same fundamental force.  It explains phenomena such as electric fields, magnetic fields, electromagnetic radiation (including light, radio waves, X-rays, etc.), and the interaction of charged particles with electromagnetic fields.|Example:  The principles of electromagnetism are fundamental to the operation of many modern technologies, from electric motors to mobile phones.|近义词:electromagnetics|反义词: (no direct antonym, but concepts like "gravitational force" could be considered contrasting)|名词
