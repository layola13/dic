morulation:/ˌmɔːrjuˈleɪʃən/| n. |调制；塑造；形态发生|The process of modulating or being modulated; the act of shaping or giving form to something.  It often refers to the process of changing the characteristics of a wave (like a sound wave or radio wave) to transmit information, or to the development of form in biological systems. | Example: The radio station uses amplitude modulation (AM) to broadcast its signal.  无线电台使用调幅(AM)广播信号。 The morulation of the clay into a beautiful vase required skill and patience. 将粘土塑造成一个美丽的的花瓶需要技巧和耐心。|近义词：modulation, shaping, formation, development |反义词：demodulation, disintegration
