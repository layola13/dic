The word "convertibleness" derives from the verb "convert" (from Latin *convertire, "to turn around, overturn," from com- "together" + vertere "to turn").  Adding the suffix "-ible" creates the adjective "convertible," meaning capable of being converted.  Finally, adding "-ness" forms the noun "convertibleness," indicating the state or quality of being convertible.
