词源:

The word "handkerchief" comes from the Middle English "hankechief," which is a combination of "hand" and "kerchief."  "Kerchief" itself originates from the Old French "covrechef," meaning "head covering."  The original meaning, therefore, referred to a head covering, but the word evolved to primarily refer to the smaller cloths used to wipe one's face and nose.
