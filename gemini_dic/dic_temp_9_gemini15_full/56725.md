The word "doore" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a word from a very niche dialect or jargon.  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered "doore".
