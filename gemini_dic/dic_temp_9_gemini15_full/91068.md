词源:
The word "hutch" ultimately derives from the Old Norse word "húð," meaning "skin" or "hide."  This likely refers to a small, enclosed structure, perhaps originally made from animal hides.  Over time, its meaning evolved to encompass various types of small enclosures, including those for animals and storage.
