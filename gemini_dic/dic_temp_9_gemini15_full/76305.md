gabbro:/ˈɡæbroʊ/| n. |辉长岩|A dark-colored, intrusive igneous rock composed mainly of plagioclase feldspar and pyroxene.  Gabbro is a coarse-grained rock, meaning its crystals are large enough to be seen with the naked eye. It is often found in large bodies called gabbroic intrusions, which form deep beneath the Earth's surface. |The sample was identified as gabbro.|近义词：basalt (although basalt is extrusive), diabase|反义词：无
