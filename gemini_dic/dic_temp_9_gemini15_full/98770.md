词源:

The word "intangibleness" is derived from the adjective "intangible," which itself comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "tangible," meaning "capable of being touched or felt."  "Tangible" has roots in the Latin word "tangere," meaning "to touch." Therefore, "intangible" means "not capable of being touched," and "intangibleness" describes the state or quality of being intangible.


用法说明：

Intangibleness is primarily used as a noun to describe the abstract nature of something. It's often used in contexts related to:

* **Business and finance:**  Describing the value of things like brand reputation, intellectual property, goodwill, and customer loyalty.
* **Arts and culture:** Describing the essence of artistic expression, inspiration, and creative ideas.
* **Philosophy and metaphysics:** Discussing abstract concepts and ideas that lack physical form.
* **Psychology:**  Referencing emotional states, feelings, and mental processes that are difficult to directly observe.

The word carries a connotation of something elusive, difficult to define, or measure objectively.  It emphasizes the lack of physical presence,  but not necessarily a lack of importance or significance.
