例句：

词源:

The word "paronomasia" comes from the Greek words  *para-* (beside, near) and *onoma* (name).  It literally means "beside the name," referring to the use of words that sound alike but have different meanings.


用法说明:

Paronomasia is primarily a literary device used in various forms of writing and speech, such as jokes, poetry, advertising, and other creative contexts.  The effectiveness of paronomasia depends heavily on the audience's understanding of the different meanings involved and the context in which it's used.  A poorly executed paronomasia can be confusing or even annoying rather than humorous.
