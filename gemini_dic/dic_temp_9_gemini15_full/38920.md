词源:
The word "confessionary" derives from the Late Latin word *confessionarius*,  meaning "pertaining to confession." This, in turn, comes from the verb *confiteri*, meaning "to confess."  The ultimate root is the Latin prefix *con-* ("together") and the verb *fateri* ("to say," "to speak").  Therefore, the word's history reflects the act of openly speaking about one's sins or wrongdoing.
