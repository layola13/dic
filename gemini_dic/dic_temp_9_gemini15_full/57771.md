词源:

The word "dreamworlds" is a compound noun formed from "dream" and "worlds."  "Dream" originates from Old English *dream, related to Old High German *trau-m "dream, joy, gladness," and ultimately from Proto-Germanic *draug-maz. "Worlds" is the plural of "world," derived from Old English weorold, from wer "man" + ald "age, time, generation."  Therefore, "dreamworlds" literally signifies multiple realms or spaces associated with dreams.
