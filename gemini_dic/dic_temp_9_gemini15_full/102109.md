isothermal:/ˌaɪ.səʊˈθɜːrməl/ | adj. | 等温的 | Relating to or denoting a process or condition occurring without change of temperature.  An isothermal process is one in which the temperature remains constant. | Example: The expansion of a gas in an isothermal process involves the absorption of heat.  等温过程中的气体膨胀涉及吸热。|近义词：isothermic |反义词：adiabatic


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The temperature remains isothermal during the reaction. = 反应过程中温度保持等温。
This process is isothermal under these conditions. = 在这些条件下，这个过程是等温的。


一般过去时:
The experiment was conducted under isothermal conditions. = 实验在等温条件下进行。
The gas expanded isothermally. = 气体等温膨胀。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied isothermal processes extensively. = 科学家们已经广泛研究了等温过程。
The system has remained isothermal throughout the experiment. = 在整个实验过程中，系统保持等温。


过去完成时:
The reaction had completed isothermally before the measurement. = 测量之前反应已经等温完成。
The temperature had been maintained isothermal throughout the previous day. = 前一天温度一直保持等温。


将来时:
The reaction will proceed isothermally. = 反应将等温进行。
The system will be kept isothermal during the experiment. = 实验期间系统将保持等温。


虚拟语气:
If the process were isothermal, the results would be different. = 如果过程是等温的，结果就会不同。
It would be ideal if the reaction could be maintained isothermal. = 如果反应能够保持等温，那就最理想了。


被动语态:
The temperature was kept isothermal by a thermostat. = 温度由恒温器保持等温。
The system was maintained isothermal throughout the experiment. = 整个实验过程中系统都保持等温。


疑问句:
Is the process isothermal? = 这个过程是等温的吗？
Was the reaction carried out under isothermal conditions? = 反应是在等温条件下进行的吗？


否定句:
The reaction was not isothermal. = 反应不是等温的。
The process did not remain isothermal throughout. = 过程并非始终保持等温。


PHRASE->
isothermal expansion 等温膨胀
isothermal process 等温过程
isothermal compression 等温压缩
isothermal transformation 等温转变
isothermal atmosphere 等温大气
