butylene:/ˈbjuːtɪliːn/| n. |丁烯|Butylene is an unsaturated hydrocarbon with four carbon atoms and one double bond. It's a colorless gas at room temperature and is highly flammable.  It exists in four isomeric forms: but-1-ene, cis-but-2-ene, trans-but-2-ene, and 2-methylpropene (isobutylene).  It's used extensively in the petrochemical industry as a feedstock for the production of various chemicals, including plastics, rubbers, and fuels.|The production of polybutylene uses butylene as a key ingredient.|近义词：butenes|反义词：无
