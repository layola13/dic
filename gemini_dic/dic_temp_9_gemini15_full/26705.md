Etymology:  The word "cadence" comes from the Late Latin word *cadentia*, meaning "a falling," from the verb *cadere*, "to fall." This reflects the sense of a rhythmic rise and fall in sound or movement.  The word entered English in the 16th century, initially referring to the rhythmic movement of marching troops.  It later expanded to encompass rhythmic patterns in music, poetry, and speech.
