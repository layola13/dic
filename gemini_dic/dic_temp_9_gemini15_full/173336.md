Etymology:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation, but not a complete equivalence.

* **democratically**: From "democracy," ultimately derived from Ancient Greek *δημοκρατία* (dēmokratía), from *δῆμος* (dēmos), "people," and *κράτος* (kratos), "power" or "rule."  Thus, "democratically" means "in a manner consistent with the principles of democracy."
