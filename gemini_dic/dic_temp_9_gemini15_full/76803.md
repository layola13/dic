词源:The etymology of "gammon" in this sense is uncertain, but it's likely related to its older meaning of "the buttock of a pig," possibly suggesting a sense of "nonsense" or "stuffing" (as in "stuffing the truth").  The verb form likely evolved from the noun usage, where "gammon" was used figuratively to mean "nonsense," "humbug," or "a deceitful action".  The shift in meaning from the physical object to the deceptive act is a common linguistic phenomenon.
