pseudoconglomerate:/ˌsuːdoʊkənˈɡlɒmərət/|/ˌpjuːdəʊkənˈɡlɒmərɪt/| n. |假砾岩|A rock that resembles a conglomerate but is formed by a different process, typically by the cementation of angular fragments rather than rounded clasts.  It lacks the well-rounded clasts characteristic of true conglomerates, often showing angular or subangular fragments.  The matrix may be of different composition to the clasts. |The outcrop showed a pseudoconglomerate formation, with angular fragments of quartzite cemented in a sandy matrix.|近义词：paraconglomerate|反义词：conglomerate|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The rock sample shows a pseudoconglomerate texture. = 岩石样本显示出假砾岩的结构。
This area is characterized by pseudoconglomerate formations. = 这个区域的特点是假砾岩地层。


一般过去时:
Geologists identified the rock as a pseudoconglomerate. = 地质学家将这块岩石鉴定为假砾岩。
The researchers studied the formation of the ancient pseudoconglomerate. = 研究人员研究了古代假砾岩的形成过程。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered several new pseudoconglomerate deposits. = 科学家们已经发现了几个新的假砾岩矿床。
Analysis has confirmed that this rock is a pseudoconglomerate. = 分析证实了这块岩石是假砾岩。


过去完成时:
They had already determined it was a pseudoconglomerate before further analysis. = 在进一步分析之前，他们就已经确定它是假砾岩了。
The geologists had suspected a pseudoconglomerate formation before the fieldwork. = 在野外工作之前，地质学家们就怀疑存在假砾岩地层。


将来时:
We will analyze the sample to determine if it is a pseudoconglomerate. = 我们将分析样本以确定它是否是假砾岩。
Further research will investigate the origin of this pseudoconglomerate. = 进一步的研究将调查这种假砾岩的起源。


虚拟语气:
If it were a true conglomerate, the clasts would be rounded. = 如果它是真正的砾岩，则其碎屑将是圆形的。
I wish we had more information about the formation of this pseudoconglomerate. = 我希望我们有更多关于这种假砾岩形成的信息。


被动语态:
The pseudoconglomerate was formed by the cementation of angular fragments. = 假砾岩是由角状碎屑胶结而成的。
The origin of this pseudoconglomerate is still being debated. = 这块假砾岩的起源仍在争论中。


疑问句:
Is this rock a pseudoconglomerate or a true conglomerate? = 这块岩石是假砾岩还是真正的砾岩？
What is the age of this pseudoconglomerate formation? = 这种假砾岩地层的年代是多少？


否定句:
This rock is not a pseudoconglomerate; it's a breccia. = 这块岩石不是假砾岩；它是角砾岩。
The sample did not exhibit the characteristics of a typical pseudoconglomerate. = 样本没有表现出典型假砾岩的特征。


PHRASE->
pseudoconglomerate formation  假砾岩层
pseudoconglomerate deposit  假砾岩矿床
angular pseudoconglomerate 角砾状假砾岩
matrix of pseudoconglomerate 假砾岩的基质
origin of pseudoconglomerate 假砾岩的成因
