词源:

The word derives from the adjective "effervescent," which itself comes from the verb "effervesce."  "Effervesce" originates from the Late Latin word *effervescere*, a combination of the prefix *ex-* (out) and *fervere* (to boil, bubble).  Thus, the original meaning relates to the bubbling or fizzing action of a liquid.  The figurative extension to describe lively enthusiasm followed naturally from this visual imagery.
