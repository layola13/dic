词源:

The word "inarguably" is formed by adding the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") to the word "arguably."  "Arguably" itself comes from the verb "argue," meaning to give reasons or cite evidence in support of an idea, claim, or action.  The suffix "-ably" transforms the verb into an adverb, indicating the manner in which something can be done. Therefore, "inarguably" signifies that something cannot be argued against.  The root traces back to the Latin word "arguere," meaning "to make bright, to make clear, to prove, to argue."


用法说明：

"Inarguably" is used to emphasize the certainty and undeniable truth of a statement. It indicates that the claim is so strong and well-supported that any attempt to argue against it would be futile.  It's a strong word, and overuse can sound overly assertive or even dismissive.  It's best used sparingly to highlight truly irrefutable points.
