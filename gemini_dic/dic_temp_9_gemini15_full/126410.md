词源:  The word "mystagogic" is derived from the Greek word  "μυσταγωγός" (mystagogos), which literally means "one who leads initiates into mysteries".  "μυστήριον" (mysterion) means "mystery," and "ἀγωγεῖν" (agōgein) means "to lead."  Therefore, the word's root signifies a guide or leader into sacred mysteries or secret knowledge, often within a religious or spiritual context.  The "-ic" suffix transforms the noun into an adjective, describing something related to or possessing the qualities of a mystagogue or their practices.
