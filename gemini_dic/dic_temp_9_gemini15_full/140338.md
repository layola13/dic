The word "ohing" is not a standard English word found in dictionaries.  It's likely a non-standard spelling or a newly coined word, possibly representing the sound of someone expressing surprise, wonder, or a similar emotion.  Therefore, a full etymological breakdown and grammatical analysis are impossible.  To provide an answer in the requested format, we'll have to make assumptions. Let's assume "ohing" is being used informally to describe the act of repeatedly saying "oh."
