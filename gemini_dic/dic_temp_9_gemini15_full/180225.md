refractions:/rɪˈfrækʃənz/ | n. | 折射 (现象)；折射作用 | The bending of a wave as it passes from one medium to another;  the change in direction of a wave due to a change in its speed.  This phenomenon is observed with light, sound, and other waves. | Example: The refractions of light through a prism create a rainbow effect.  折射光线穿过棱镜产生了彩虹效应。

The refractions of sound waves can cause distortions in audio recordings.  声波的折射会导致录音失真。


近义词：bending, deflection, deviation | 反义词：reflection (in some contexts)


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The prism refracts light. = 棱镜折射光线。
Light refracts as it passes from air to water. = 光线从空气进入水中时发生折射。


一般过去时:
The lens refracted the light beam. = 透镜折射了光束。
The scientist observed how the water refracted the laser. = 科学家观察了水如何折射激光。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the refractions of light for centuries. = 科学家们已经研究光线的折射几个世纪了。
The experiment has shown interesting refractions. = 实验显示了有趣的折射现象。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, scientists hadn't fully understood the refractions of light. = 在发现之前，科学家们并没有完全理解光的折射。
They had already observed similar refractions in other experiments. = 他们在之前的实验中已经观察到类似的折射现象。


将来时:
The new telescope will use advanced lenses to minimize refractions. = 新望远镜将使用先进的透镜来最大限度地减少折射。
We will study the refractions of different wavelengths of light. = 我们将研究不同波长的光的折射。


虚拟语气:
If the air were denser, the refractions would be greater. = 如果空气更稠密，折射会更大。
I wish I understood the complex refractions in this experiment. = 我希望我能理解这个实验中复杂的折射现象。


被动语态:
Light is refracted by the lens. = 光线被透镜折射。
The refractions were accurately measured by the instrument. = 折射现象被仪器精确测量。


疑问句:
What causes these refractions? = 这些折射是由什么引起的？
How do refractions affect the image quality? = 折射如何影响图像质量？


否定句:
The material did not refract light significantly. = 该材料没有显著折射光线。
There were no noticeable refractions in the experiment. = 实验中没有明显的折射现象。


PHRASE->

angle of refraction: 折射角
index of refraction: 折射率
refraction of light: 光的折射
double refraction: 双折射
atmospheric refraction: 大气折射

词源:

From Middle French *refraction, from Latin refractio, from refract- ‘broken’, past participle stem of refringere ‘to break’, from re- ‘again’ + frangere ‘to break’.
