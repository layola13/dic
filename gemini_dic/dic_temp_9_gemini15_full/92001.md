PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "hyperobtrusively".  The word itself is relatively uncommon.  However, phrases using the root word "obtrusive" can be adapted:

obtrusively present: 过分显眼的存在
obtrusively loud: 过分大声
obtrusively bright: 过分明亮
obtrusively placed: 位置过于显眼
obtrusively designed: 设计过于显眼


词源:

* **hyper-**:  From Greek, meaning "over," "above," "beyond," or "excessive."
* **obtrusive**: From Latin "obtrudere," meaning "to thrust upon," "to force upon."  This combines "ob-" (towards, against) and "trudere" (to thrust).

Therefore, "hyperobtrusively" means "excessively thrusting upon," or "excessively noticeable in an unpleasant way."
