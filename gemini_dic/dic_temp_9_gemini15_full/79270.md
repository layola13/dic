词源:
The name "Glastonbury" is derived from the Old English name "Glaestingaburh," which literally translates to "the fortified place of the Glaestingas."  The Glaestingas were an Anglo-Saxon tribe.  The "bury" part is the Old English word for "fortified place" or "town".  Over time, the name evolved into its modern form.
