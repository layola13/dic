PHRASE->
There is no phrase specifically using "painfulnesses" as a common collocation.  The word itself is somewhat unusual and less frequently used than related terms like "pains" or "aches."  Instead, descriptive phrases are used:  "multiple painfulnesses," "intense painfulnesses," "unbearable painfulnesses," etc.  Consider using "severe pains," "excruciating aches," or "agonizing suffering" for more natural phrasing.
