词源:
The word "harlot" ultimately derives from the Old French word *harlot*, meaning "a vagabond, a rascal," which itself comes from the Old Norse word *harlotr*.  The semantic shift to its current meaning happened gradually over time.  The original meaning encompassed a more general sense of low morals and vagrancy, but over centuries, it became primarily associated with prostitution.
