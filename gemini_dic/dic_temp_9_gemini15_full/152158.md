词源:  The adverb "patly" derives from the adjective "pat," meaning "suitable" or "fitting."  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb.  The origin of "pat" in this sense is obscure, but it likely relates to older senses meaning "exactly" or "precisely," ultimately stemming from Old French or possibly a Germanic root.
