词源:

The word "ribalds" originates from the Old French word "ribaude," meaning "a woman of loose morals," or "prostitute."  This term itself likely derives from a Germanic root, possibly related to words implying "to scold" or "to brawl," suggesting a connection between vulgarity and disruptive behavior.  Over time, the term broadened to encompass both men and women characterized by their coarse and indecent behavior.
