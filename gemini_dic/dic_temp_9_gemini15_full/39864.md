constants:/ˈkɒnstənts/ /ˈkɑːnstənts/| n.|常量，常数，恒量|A constant is a value that does not change.  In mathematics and programming, it refers to a fixed value. In physics, it may refer to a fundamental physical quantity that remains unchanged under certain conditions.|Example:  The speed of light is a fundamental constant. 光速是一个基本常数。

The gravitational constant is a key element in Newton's law of universal gravitation. 万有引力常数是牛顿万有引力定律中的一个关键因素。|近义词：constant value, invariable, fixed value|反义词：variable, fluctuating, changeable|名词
