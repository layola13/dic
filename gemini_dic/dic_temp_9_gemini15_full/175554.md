rand: /rænd/ | n. |随机数，随机变量| A rand is a random number, often generated by a computer program or system.  It's a number chosen seemingly at random from a set of possible values, with each value having an equal (or approximately equal) probability of being selected.|Example: The computer generated a rand between 1 and 100. = 电脑生成了一个1到100之间的随机数。|近义词：random number, chance number |反义词：determined number, predictable number


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The computer generates a rand. = 电脑生成一个随机数。
This function returns a rand. = 此函数返回一个随机数。

一般过去时:
The program generated a rand yesterday. = 程序昨天生成了一个随机数。
We used a rand in the experiment. = 我们在实验中使用了随机数。

现在完成时:
The system has generated many rands. = 系统已经生成了许多随机数。
They have used rands in their simulations. = 他们在模拟中使用了随机数。

过去完成时:
The program had already generated the rands before the analysis began. = 分析开始之前，程序已经生成了随机数。
They had used rands in previous experiments. = 他们在之前的实验中使用了随机数。

将来时:
The software will generate a rand. = 软件将生成一个随机数。
We will need many rands for the simulation. = 我们将需要许多随机数用于模拟。

虚拟语气:
If the system generated a rand, the result would be different. = 如果系统生成一个随机数，结果将会不同。
I wish the program had generated a different rand. = 我希望程序生成了一个不同的随机数。

被动语态:
A rand was generated by the computer. = 随机数是由电脑生成的。
Rands are used in many statistical analyses. = 随机数用于许多统计分析中。

疑问句:
What kind of rand was used? = 使用了什么类型的随机数？
How many rands were generated? = 生成了多少个随机数？

否定句:
The program didn't generate a rand. = 程序没有生成随机数。
They didn't use rands in their calculations. = 他们在计算中没有使用随机数。


PHRASE->
rand function = 随机数函数
rand number generator = 随机数发生器
pseudo-rand number = 伪随机数
rand sampling = 随机抽样
