orogenies:/əˈrɒdʒəniz/ | n. |造山运动 |The process of mountain building, involving the deformation and uplift of the Earth's crust.  Orogenies are typically associated with plate tectonics, where the collision of tectonic plates leads to folding, faulting, and metamorphism of rocks. |Example: The Himalayas are a result of a major orogeny caused by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian plates. 喜马拉雅山脉是印度板块和欧亚板块碰撞造成的重大造山运动的结果。 The Appalachian Mountains are the result of several orogenies that occurred over millions of years. 阿巴拉契亚山脉是数百万年来多次造山运动的结果。|近义词：mountain building, tectonics, uplift |反义词：erosion, denudation


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Orogenies shape the Earth's surface. = 造山运动塑造了地球表面。
The process of orogeny is complex. = 造山运动的过程很复杂。


一般过去时:
The Appalachian orogeny occurred millions of years ago. = 阿巴拉契亚造山运动发生在数百万年前。
Several major orogenies shaped the continents. = 几次主要的造山运动塑造了大陆。


现在完成时:
Orogenies have significantly altered the Earth's landscape. = 造山运动已经显著改变了地球的地貌。
Scientists have studied orogenies for centuries. = 科学家们已经研究造山运动几个世纪了。


过去完成时:
Before the collision, the rocks had undergone significant changes. = 在碰撞之前，岩石已经发生了显著的变化。
The mountain range had already formed before the erosion began. = 在侵蚀开始之前，山脉就已经形成了。


将来时:
Future orogenies will continue to reshape the continents. = 未来造山运动将继续重塑大陆。
Scientists will continue to study the processes of orogeny. = 科学家们将继续研究造山运动的过程。


虚拟语气:
If there were no orogenies, the Earth's surface would be drastically different. = 如果没有造山运动，地球表面将大相径庭。
It is hypothesized that if the plates moved differently, the orogenies would be different. = 假设板块移动方式不同，造山运动也会不同。


被动语态:
The mountains were formed by an ancient orogeny. = 山脉是由古代造山运动形成的。
The geological structures are being studied to understand past orogenies. = 正在研究地质结构以了解过去的造山运动。


疑问句:
What caused this specific orogeny? = 导致这次特定造山运动的原因是什么？
How long did the orogeny last? = 造山运动持续了多久？


否定句:
This area has not been significantly affected by recent orogenies. = 这个地区没有受到最近造山运动的显著影响。
The theory doesn't explain all aspects of the orogeny. = 这个理论并没有解释造山运动的所有方面。


PHRASE->
Alpine orogeny:阿尔卑斯造山运动
Hercynian orogeny: 华力西造山运动
Caledonian orogeny: 加里东造山运动
