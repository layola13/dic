词源:
Exoneration comes from the Latin word "exonerare," which is a combination of "ex-" (out, from) and "onerare" (to burden).  Therefore, it literally means "to unload," "to free from a burden," or "to relieve."  The legal sense developed from the idea of freeing someone from the burden of guilt or accusation.
