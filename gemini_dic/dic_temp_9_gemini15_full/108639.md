The word "least" does not exist independently as a standalone word with a detailed etymology and usage as requested.  It is the superlative form of the adjective "little," and the adverb "little."  Therefore, a full breakdown requires analyzing "little" and then explaining the superlative "least."


**little:**

/ˈlɪtəl/ | adj., adv. | 少量的，小的；很少 |  Describes something small in size, amount, or importance.  It can function as both an adjective and an adverb.

**English Analysis:**  "Little" has Old English roots, derived from the Proto-Germanic *lītilaz.  Its meaning has remained relatively consistent throughout its history.  The word functions differently depending on context.  When used before a noun, it acts as an adjective; when used without a noun, it functions as an adverb modifying verbs or adjectives. Note that as an adjective, the negative form, "few," is typically used with countable nouns, while "little" is used with uncountable nouns.  When emphasizing smallness, "tiny" or "miniature" are better choices.

**Examples:**

* **Adjective:**  He has little money. 他几乎没有钱。
* **Adjective:**  The little dog barked loudly. 那只小狗大声吠叫。
* **Adverb:**  She sleeps little. 她睡得很少。
* **Adverb:**  I care little for his opinion. 我不太在乎他的意见。

**least:**

/liːst/ | adj., adv. | 最少的，最小的；最不 | The superlative form of "little." It indicates the smallest degree or amount.  Like "little," it can function as both an adjective and an adverb.


**English Analysis:**  "Least" is the superlative form of "little," formed by adding the suffix "-est."  It directly reflects the comparative ("less") and positive ("little") forms.   It maintains the distinction between countable and uncountable nouns in the same way as "little."


**Examples:**

* **Adjective:** This is the least expensive option. 这是最便宜的选择。
* **Adjective:** She had the least amount of experience. 她的经验最少。
* **Adverb:** I like that option least. 我最不喜欢那个选择。

**Antonyms (Adjective & Adverb):** most, greatest, maximum


**USAGE->**

The usage of "least" and "little" largely follows the same grammatical rules of adjectives and adverbs.  There's no distinct tense conjugation because they are not verbs.  Their function within a sentence depends on their role as adjectives or adverbs.  They can be used in affirmative, negative, interrogative, and exclamatory sentences.  Since they are not verbs, passive voice and other verb-related tenses do not apply.


**PHRASE->**

* at least: 至少
* to the least: 至多
* least of all: 最不
* not in the least: 一点也不
* the least bit: 一点点



Note: The provided format for "what" is not directly applicable to "least" because they belong to different grammatical categories.  "What" is an interrogative pronoun, while "least" is an adjective and adverb.
