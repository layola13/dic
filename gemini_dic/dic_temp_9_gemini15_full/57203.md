词源：

The term "down-tube" is a compound word.  "Down" indicates the downward position of the tube relative to other parts of the bicycle frame, and "tube" refers to the hollow cylindrical structure itself.  The term's origin is directly linked to the evolution of bicycle frame design,  emerging alongside the development of tubular frames in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  The specific etymology isn't traceable to a single inventor or document but is a natural descriptive term arising from the object's physical characteristics.
