pseudoplasticity: /ˌsuːdoʊplæˈstɪsɪti/ | n. | 假塑性 |  The property of a non-Newtonian fluid whose viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate.  This means that the fluid becomes less viscous (thinner) as it is stirred or sheared more forcefully.  | Example:  Many paints exhibit pseudoplasticity, becoming easier to apply with increased brushing or stirring.  This is because the shear stress applied breaks down the internal structure of the paint, making it flow more readily. | 近义词: shear-thinning | 反义词: dilatant
