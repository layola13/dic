词源:
From Latin *larva, meaning "ghost," "mask," or "specter." This is because the larval form of an insect often looks dramatically different from its adult form, hence the association with something ghostly or masked.  The word's connection to the insect world likely developed through the observation of the striking changes during metamorphosis.
