have-a-hand-in: /ˌhæv ə ˈhænd ɪn/ | phrasal verb |参与，参与其中，插手 |To be involved in something, especially something secret or dishonest.  |例句：It is believed that he had a hand in the disappearance of the documents.  人们相信他参与了文件的失踪案。

He claims to have had no hand in the robbery. 他声称与抢劫案无关。


近义词：participate in, be involved in, contribute to, be implicated in |反义词：have nothing to do with, be uninvolved in


词源:  The phrase originates from the idea of physically manipulating something.  "Hand" refers to direct involvement or influence, and "have a hand in" implies a degree of active participation. The addition of "a" before "hand" likely softens the implication, suggesting a level of involvement that might be less than complete or direct control.
