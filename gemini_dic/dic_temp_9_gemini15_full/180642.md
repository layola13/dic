The word "regoverns" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis following your requested format.  To help you, I can offer possibilities based on what the word might be intended to mean:


**Possible Interpretations and Analysis (Speculative):**

If "regoverns" was meant to be a combination of "re-" and a word relating to governance, several possibilities arise:


1. **Re-governs (as a verb):**  This would mean to govern again or to govern anew.


   * **Pronunciation:** /ˌriːˈɡʌvərnz/ (US) /ˌriːˈɡʌvənz/ (UK)
   * **Word type:** Verb
   * **Translation:**  重新治理；再次统治
   * **Analysis:** This is a compound verb formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") to the verb "governs."  It implies a renewed or repeated act of governance.
   * **Example Sentences:**
     * The new administration re-governs the country with a focus on economic reform.  (新政府以经济改革为重点重新治理国家。)
     * After the coup, the military re-governs the nation. (政变之后，军队重新统治国家。)
   * **Synonyms:**  regulate anew, rule again, administer afresh
   * **Antonyms:**  abandon governance, relinquish control


2. **Re-governs (as a noun – unlikely):** This would be grammatically unusual, but could theoretically refer to a renewed or repeated act of governance.


   * **Pronunciation:**  Same as above.
   * **Word type:**  Noun (grammatically awkward)
   * **Translation:**  (unlikely, context-dependent)  重新治理的行为；再次统治的事件
   * **Analysis:**  Highly unusual and context-dependent; would need more detail for accurate analysis.
   * **Example Sentence:** (Difficult to construct a natural sentence with this as a noun.)
   * **Synonyms:**  re-administration, re-regulation
   * **Antonyms:**  abdication of power, relinquishment of control


If "regoverns" was a misspelling of a different word, please provide the intended word, and I can offer a detailed analysis.
