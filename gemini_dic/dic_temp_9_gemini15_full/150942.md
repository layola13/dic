词源:
The word "paralyser" comes from the verb "paralyse" (or "paralyze" in American English), which in turn originates from the Greek word "paralyein," meaning "to disable" or "to loosen beside."  This reflects the effect of paralysis, where the ability to move or function is impaired.  The "-er" suffix indicates an agent or instrument that performs the action of paralysing.
