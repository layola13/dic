propellant:/ˈprɒpələnt/ /ˈprɑːpələnt/| n. |推进剂，推进器| A substance used to propel something, especially a rocket or other vehicle.  It is a material that produces thrust by expelling matter, typically gases, in one direction.  |例句：The rocket's propellant ignited, sending it soaring into the sky. 火箭的推进剂点燃，使其冲向天空。

例句：Solid propellant is used in many types of missiles.  许多类型的导弹使用固体推进剂。


近义词：propellent, fuel, oxidizer (depending on context)| 反义词：None specifically, but terms like "brake" or "restraint" could be considered contextual opposites. | 词性：名词


词源:
The word "propellant" comes from the verb "propel," meaning to drive or push something forward.  "Propel" itself is derived from the Latin word "propellere," which is a combination of "pro-" (forward) and "pellere" (to drive or push).  The suffix "-ant" is used to form nouns that indicate agents or things that perform an action.
