Etymology:  The word "cowpea" originates from the 17th century.  The "cow" part is somewhat obscure, but theories suggest it might refer to the fact that cows sometimes ate the plants or that the peas were considered a feed for livestock, unlike peas intended for human consumption. "Pea" is derived from the Old French "pois," ultimately from the Latin "pisum."  The term highlights the plant's association with cattle and its classification as a type of pea.
