词源:
Inefficiencies is the plural form of inefficiency. Inefficiency comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") + "efficiency".  Efficiency originates from the late Middle English word "efficience," derived from the Old French "efficience," ultimately from the Latin "efficientia," meaning "acting," "doing," or "bringing about."  Therefore, inefficiency means "not acting effectively" or "lacking effectiveness."
