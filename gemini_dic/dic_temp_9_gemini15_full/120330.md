词源:

The word "minihospitals" is a compound word formed by combining "mini," meaning small or miniature, with "hospitals," the plural of "hospital."  The word "hospital" has roots in the Latin word "hospitale," meaning "guest house," reflecting the early function of hospitals as places of refuge and care for travelers and the sick. The prefix "mini-" is of recent origin, a diminutive form widely used in English.
