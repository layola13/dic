词源:

The word "self-confinements" is a compound word.  "Self" is a prefix meaning "of or by oneself,"  "confinement" is derived from the verb "confine" (to restrict or restrain), which ultimately comes from the Old French word "confine" and Latin "confinis" (boundary).  Therefore, "self-confinements" literally means the act of confining oneself.
