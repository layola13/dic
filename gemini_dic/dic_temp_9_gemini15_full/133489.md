nonfermentabilities:/ˌnɒnfɜːmɛntəˈbɪlətiz/| n. |不可发酵性；不易发酵物质|The inability of a substance to be fermented by microorganisms.  This term often refers to the characteristics of a substance, typically a carbohydrate, that prevents it from being broken down by fermentation processes. For example, certain sugars might be nonfermentable due to their complex structure or the lack of appropriate enzymes in the fermenting organism.|The study focused on the nonfermentabilities of various polysaccharides.|近义词:unfermentability, resistance to fermentation|反义词:fermentability


USAGE->
