The word "chawg" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a regional dialect word, slang, or a neologism (newly coined word).  To provide the requested analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (e.g., a book, a conversation, a website)
* **What was the context of its use?**  This will help determine the intended meaning.

If you can provide this information, I can attempt a more accurate analysis, or at least suggest possible interpretations.
