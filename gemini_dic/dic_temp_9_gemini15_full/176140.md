词源:

The word "razz" (meaning to tease or heckle) likely originated in American slang in the early 20th century. Its precise etymology remains uncertain, but some theories link it to onomatopoeia (words that imitate sounds) or possibly a distortion of other slang terms. The "-ing" suffix transforms it into a gerund (verbal noun) describing the action of razzing.
