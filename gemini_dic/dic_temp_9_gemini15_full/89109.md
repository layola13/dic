homaloid:/ˈhɒməlɔɪd/ | n. |拟同形体，类平面体 |A homaloid is a surface that is approximately flat or planar, often used in geometry and related fields. It's a generalization of a plane, allowing for slight deviations from perfect flatness.  The term often appears in discussions of map projections and geometric approximations. |Example: In cartography, the projection of a sphere onto a homaloid is often employed to minimize distortion.  制图学中，将球体投影到拟同形体上常用以最小化变形。|近义词：approximation, planar surface |反义词：highly curved surface
