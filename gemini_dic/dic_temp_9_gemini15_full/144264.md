The word "outsonnet" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a proper noun, or a word from a specialized field.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer a more helpful response.
