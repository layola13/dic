词源:

The word "compassionately" is derived from the adjective "compassionate," which itself comes from the Late Middle English word "compassionat,"  meaning "suffering with."  This word is a combination of the Latin prefix "com-" (meaning "with" or "together") and the verb "pati," meaning "to suffer." The suffix "-ate" transforms the verb into an adjective.  Therefore, "compassionate" literally means "suffering with" or "feeling sympathy for another's suffering."  The adverbial suffix "-ly" is added to create "compassionately," modifying verbs and describing how an action is performed.
