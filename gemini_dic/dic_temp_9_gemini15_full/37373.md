词源：From Middle English *commensuration, from Latin *commensurationem (nominative *commensuratio), from com- ("together") + mensura ("measure").  The original meaning related to the act of measuring something against another, later evolving to imply a proportionate response or fitting reaction to a situation – whether positive or negative.
