participle:/ˈpɑːrtɪsɪpəl/ | adj. n. | 分词 | A participle is a verb form that functions as an adjective.  It describes a noun or pronoun and often indicates time, manner, cause, or condition. There are two main types: present participles (ending in -ing) and past participles (often ending in -ed, -en, -t, or -n).  Present participles describe actions happening at the same time as the main verb, while past participles describe actions completed before the main verb. |
