词源:  From Italian *salvo*, literally "safe and sound," from Latin *salvus* ("safe, unharmed").  The original meaning referred to a ceremonial discharge of guns as a salute, implying that everyone remained safe afterwards.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass any simultaneous discharge of weapons.
