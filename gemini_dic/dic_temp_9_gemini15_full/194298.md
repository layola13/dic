self-oscillating: /ˌsɛlfˈɒsɪleɪtɪŋ/ | adj. | 自激振荡的 |  Self-oscillating describes a system that generates its own oscillations without requiring an external periodic signal.  It relies on internal feedback mechanisms to sustain rhythmic behavior.  This is common in electronic circuits, mechanical systems, and even biological processes. | Example: The circuit design incorporates a self-oscillating component to generate a precise timing signal.  这个电路设计包含一个自激振荡元件以产生精确的定时信号。  |近义词:  auto-oscillating | 反义词: externally driven, damped
