The word "motacil" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis.  It may be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific jargon or dialect, or a proper noun.  If you can provide more context (e.g., where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer more information.
