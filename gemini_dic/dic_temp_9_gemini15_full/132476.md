词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "derogation," which comes from the Latin word "derogatio," meaning "a taking away" or "a lessening."  "Derogatio" itself is formed from "de-" (meaning "down" or "away") and "rogatio" (meaning "asking" or "proposing").  Therefore, "nonderogation" literally means "not a taking away" or "not a lessening."
