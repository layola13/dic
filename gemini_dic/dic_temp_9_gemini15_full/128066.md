词源：源自"nerveless" (adj.) + "-ness" (suffix indicating a state or condition).  "Nerveless" itself comes from "nerve" (n.) meaning "strength of character; courage; boldness; impudence" (an older meaning now largely obsolete except in this context).  Therefore, the original meaning of "nerveless" was "lacking nerve; cowardly," but the meaning has shifted to its modern, almost opposite sense.
