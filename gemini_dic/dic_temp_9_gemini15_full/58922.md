The word "duse" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* It's a slang term, dialect word, or neologism not yet widely recognized.
* It's a proper noun (name of a person, place, or thing).
* It's from a different language.

If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, a sentence it was used in, etc.), I may be able to offer a more helpful response.
