Etymology:

The word "nonrevolutionary" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" meaning "not," and the adjective "revolutionary," which derives from "revolution."  "Revolution" itself originates from the Late Latin *revolutionem, the noun of action from *revolvere (to turn around, revolve),  combining the prefix *re- (again, back) with *volvere (to roll, turn).  Thus, "nonrevolutionary" literally means "not involving a turning around or overturning of existing systems."
