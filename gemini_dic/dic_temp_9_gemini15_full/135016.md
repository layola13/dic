词源:
The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), the adjective "negligible" (meaning "so small or unimportant as to be not worth considering"), and the adverbial suffix "-ly".  Therefore, "nonnegligibly" means "not negligibly," or "to a degree that is not negligible."  The root of "negligible" comes from the Latin word "negligere," meaning "to neglect" or "to disregard."
