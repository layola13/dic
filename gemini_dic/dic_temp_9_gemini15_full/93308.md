词源:  The word is a combination of "ill" (meaning bad or evil) and "disposedness," which derives from the verb "dispose," meaning to incline or make ready.  "Disposedness" itself is a somewhat archaic form, but the combination creates a clear sense of negatively inclined attitude.  The root of "dispose" traces back to Old French "disposer" and ultimately to Latin "disponere," meaning "to place, arrange, set in order."  The "ill" prefix adds the negative connotation.
