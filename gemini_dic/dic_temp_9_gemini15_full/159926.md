Etymology:

The word "polyphagous" comes from the Greek words:

* **poly- (πολύ-)**: meaning "many" or "much"
* **phagein (φαγεῖν)**: meaning "to eat"
* **-ous (-ος)**:  a suffix forming adjectives, meaning "possessing the nature of" or "full of".


Therefore, polyphagous literally means "eating many things".
