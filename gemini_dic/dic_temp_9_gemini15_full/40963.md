词源:
The word "cooperativization" is derived from the noun "cooperative" and the suffix "-ization," which indicates the process of making something into a cooperative.  "Cooperative" itself comes from the Latin "cooperari," meaning "to work together." Therefore, cooperativization literally means "the process of making something work together collectively".
