The word derives from "light-footed," which is a compound adjective combining "light" (meaning "easy, agile") and "footed" (referring to feet or movement of feet). The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating a quality or state.  The plural "-es" is added to indicate multiple instances of this quality.
