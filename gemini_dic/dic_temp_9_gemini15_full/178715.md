recrystallization: /ˌriːkrɪstəlɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 重结晶；再结晶 | The process by which crystals of a substance are dissolved and then allowed to reform, often resulting in larger, purer crystals. This is a common purification technique in chemistry.  | Example: Recrystallization is a crucial step in purifying many organic compounds. = 重结晶是纯化许多有机化合物的重要步骤。The impure sample was purified by recrystallization. = 不纯的样品通过重结晶得到纯化。| 近义词：re-crystallization, purification | 反义词：amorphization, melting


USAGE->

将来时:
We will recrystallize the product tomorrow. = 我们明天将对产品进行重结晶。
The students will learn about recrystallization in their next lab session. = 学生们将在下一个实验课上学习重结晶。


虚拟语气:
If we had more time, we would recrystallize the compound again. = 如果我们有更多时间，我们将再次对化合物进行重结晶。
It would be beneficial if the sample were recrystallized before analysis. = 如果在分析之前对样品进行重结晶将是有益的。


被动语态:
