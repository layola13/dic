词源:
The word "record-player" is a compound word.  "Record" comes from the Old French *recorde, meaning "thing remembered," ultimately from the Latin *re-cord-,  referring to something written down.  In the context of music, it refers to a phonograph record.  "Player" derives from the Old English *pleg-, meaning "game" or "play," which evolved into the modern English word with its current meaning. The combination signifies a device that plays records.
