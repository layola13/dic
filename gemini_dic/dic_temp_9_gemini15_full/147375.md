词源:
The word "overneglects" is formed by adding the prefix "over-" to the verb "neglects".  "Over-" indicates an excessive degree or to a greater extent than usual.  "Neglect" itself comes from the Old French "negliger" (to neglect), ultimately from the Latin "negligo," which combines "nec" (not) and "lego" (I gather, I choose).  Therefore, "overneglects" literally means "to not gather or choose to pay attention to excessively."
