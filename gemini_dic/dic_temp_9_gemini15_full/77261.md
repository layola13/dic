gastropodan:/ˈɡæstrəpɒdən/ | n. |腹足动物|A gastropod is a mollusk of the class Gastropoda, such as a snail or slug, that typically has a spiral shell.  Gastropods are characterized by their single, usually spiraled shell (in some cases, the shell is reduced or absent) and a muscular foot used for locomotion. They are found in a wide variety of habitats, including marine, freshwater, and terrestrial environments.|例句：Snails and slugs are common examples of gastropods. 蜗牛和蛞蝓是腹足动物的常见例子。

The giant African land snail is a large gastropod. 巨大的非洲陆地蜗牛是一种大型腹足动物。|近义词：mollusk, shellfish (in some contexts)|反义词：None specifically, but terms referring to animals without shells or with different locomotion methods could be considered contrasting.
