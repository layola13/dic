词源:
The name "Piccadilly" is believed to derive from "piccadill," a type of stiff, often elaborately decorated, collar worn in the 17th century.  A tailor named Robert Baker, who lived near the area that would become Piccadilly, is thought to have sold these collars, and the street may have taken its name from his trade.  The exact etymology is debated, but the connection to the collar is the most widely accepted explanation.
