cultrivorous: /ˌkʌltʃɪˈvɔːrəs/ | adj. | 食文化的；培养文化的 |  Relating to or characteristic of a culture that cultivates or consumes other cultures.  This word is a relatively rare and newly coined term, combining "culture" and "voracious" (or "-vorous," a suffix indicating eating). It suggests a culture that aggressively absorbs or dominates other cultures, often to the detriment of the absorbed cultures.  There is no established usage in standard dictionaries.
