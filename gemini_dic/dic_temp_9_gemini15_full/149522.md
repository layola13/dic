词源:

From "pagan" + "-ic" (suffix forming adjectives). "Pagan" itself ultimately derives from Latin *paganus, meaning "country dweller," originally referring to those who remained outside the reach of Roman Christianity.  The term gradually took on its current meaning through association with those who retained pre-Christian beliefs and practices.
