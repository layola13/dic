mitochondrion:/ˌmaɪtəˈkɒndrɪən/ | n. |线粒体 | A mitochondrion is a double-membrane-bound organelle found in most eukaryotic organisms. It is the "powerhouse" of the cell, generating most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), used as a source of chemical energy.  Mitochondria are involved in various other cellular processes, including cellular signaling, cell differentiation, and cell death. They have their own DNA (mtDNA) and ribosomes, suggesting an endosymbiotic origin. | Example: The mitochondrion plays a crucial role in cellular respiration.  线粒体在细胞呼吸中起着至关重要的作用。|近义词: (none, it's a specific organelle) |反义词: (none)


USAGE->
