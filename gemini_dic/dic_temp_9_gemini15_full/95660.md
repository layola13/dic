词源:
The word "incomprehension" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the verb "comprehend" (meaning "to understand"), and the suffix "-ion" (forming a noun).  Therefore, it literally means "not understanding."  The root "comprehend" traces back to the Latin "comprehendere,"  from "com-" (together) and "prehendere" (to grasp, seize).
