词源:

The word "renouncers" is derived from the verb "renounce," which comes from the Old French word "renoncier"  and ultimately from the Latin "renuntiare," meaning "to declare against, refuse, give up."  The suffix "-ers" is a common English nominalizing suffix, turning a verb into a noun denoting a person who performs the action.
