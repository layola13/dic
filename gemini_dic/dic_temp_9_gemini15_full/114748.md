malonate: /ˈmæləneɪt/ | n. |丙二酸酯|Malonate is the anion of malonic acid, a dicarboxylic acid.  It's often used in biochemistry and organic chemistry.  It's a competitive inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, an enzyme in the citric acid cycle.|The malonate ion acts as a competitive inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase.|近义词:  (no direct synonyms, but related terms include: dicarboxylate,  succinate (a structural analog)) |反义词: (no direct antonyms)

The experiment did not yield conclusive results concerning malonate inhibition. = 关于丙二酸酯抑制的实验没有得出确定的结果。


PHRASE->
dimethyl malonate = 二甲基丙二酸酯
ethyl malonate = 丙二酸二乙酯
diethyl malonate = 丙二酸二乙酯 (same as ethyl malonate)
malonate esters = 丙二酸酯

词源:
The word "malonate" is derived from "malonic acid," which itself originates from the Latin word "malum," meaning "apple."  Malonic acid was first isolated from apples.  The suffix "-onate" indicates the anion (negatively charged ion) form of the acid.
