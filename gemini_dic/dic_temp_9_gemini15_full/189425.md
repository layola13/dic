词源:

The word "sailboarding" is a compound word combining "sail" (referring to the sail used to propel the board) and "boarding" (referring to the act of riding a board on water).  Both "sail" and "board" have long histories in the English language, with "sail" originating from Old English *segil and "board" from Old English bord.  The combination to form "sailboarding" is a relatively modern development, coinciding with the rise of the sport in the late 20th century.
