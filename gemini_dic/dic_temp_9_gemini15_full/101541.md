词源:  From the Greek word "eirōneia," meaning "feigned ignorance" or "dissimulation."  Initially, it referred to a literary device where a character pretends to be less intelligent or knowledgeable than they are.  Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass the more general sense of incongruity between expectation and reality.
