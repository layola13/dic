nondegenerate: /ˌnɒnˈdʒɛnəreɪt/ | adj. | 非退化的，非简并的 | Not degenerate; not reduced to a simpler form.  A nondegenerate matrix, for example, has a non-zero determinant.  In geometry, a nondegenerate conic section is one that is not a single point or a pair of intersecting lines. |


例句：

The matrix is nondegenerate, meaning its determinant is nonzero. = 矩阵是非退化的，这意味着它的行列式不为零。

This conic section is nondegenerate because it's a proper ellipse. = 这个圆锥曲线是非退化的，因为它是一个正常的椭圆。


近义词：full-rank (for matrices), proper (for conic sections)


反义词：degenerate


词源：

The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "degenerate."  "Degenerate" itself comes from the Latin "degenerare," meaning "to deviate from the normal type,"  combining "de-" (down, away from) and "generare" (to produce, beget).


用法说明：

The adjective "nondegenerate" is primarily used in mathematics and related fields. It indicates that a structure or object possesses the full expected properties and hasn't collapsed or simplified into a less complex form.  Its meaning varies slightly depending on the context:

* **Linear Algebra:**  A nondegenerate matrix is one with a non-zero determinant.  This means it's invertible and its rows (or columns) are linearly independent.

* **Geometry:** A nondegenerate conic section (ellipse, parabola, hyperbola) is one that retains its standard form and is not reduced to a single point, a line, or a pair of intersecting lines.

* **Other contexts:** The term can appear more broadly to indicate that something hasn't lost its essential characteristics or properties.  For example, a nondegenerate code in coding theory is one that meets certain error-correction criteria.


The word is always used attributively (before a noun) and doesn't usually appear in informal conversation.
