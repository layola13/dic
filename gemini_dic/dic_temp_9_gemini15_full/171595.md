pulmobranchiata:/ˌpʌlməˈbræŋkiˌeɪtə/| n. |肺鰓類，肺鰓動物|  A taxonomic class encompassing aquatic gastropods that breathe using both lungs and gills.  Pulmobranchiata are characterized by their ability to utilize atmospheric oxygen through a lung-like structure, while also possessing gills for aquatic respiration.

The class is currently considered obsolete in modern taxonomy, with its members now classified within other groups. |Example:  Some members of the former class Pulmobranchiata are known for their ability to aestivate during dry periods.  一些前肺鰓類成員以其在乾旱時期夏眠的能力而聞名。|近义词: (Obsolete classification, no true synonyms)|反义词:  (No direct antonyms, as it refers to a specific group)|名词
