词源:
The word "Jewish" ultimately derives from the Hebrew word "יהודי" (Yehudi), meaning "Judean" or "belonging to Judah."  Judah was one of the twelve tribes of Israel, and over time, the term became associated with the descendants of the Kingdom of Judah and, eventually, all followers of Judaism.  The English word evolved through various stages of transliteration and adaptation from Hebrew and other languages.
