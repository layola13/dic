nondeceleration: /ˌnɒndeˌsɛləˈreɪʃən/ | n. | 不减速，持续加速 | The continued increase in speed or rate; the absence of deceleration.  This word is not commonly used and is essentially a newly coined term formed by combining "non-" and "deceleration".  It describes a situation where something is not slowing down but rather maintaining or increasing its speed. | Example: The nondeceleration of the vehicle led to a serious accident.  车辆的持续加速导致了严重的事故。| 近义词:acceleration, continuous increase, escalation | 反义词: deceleration, retardation, slowing down | 名词
