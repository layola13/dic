词源:The term "jukebox" is believed to have originated in the early 20th century in African American communities.  The exact etymology is debated, but one popular theory links it to the word "juke," a slang term with uncertain origins possibly related to "jook joint," a place for dancing and drinking, or even an earlier term for a disorderly house.  The "-box" suffix simply indicates a container or enclosure.
