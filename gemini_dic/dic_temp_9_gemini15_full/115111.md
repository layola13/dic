词源:
The word "manger" comes from the Old French word "mangeoire," meaning "trough" or "feeding trough."  This, in turn, derives from the Old French verb "manger," meaning "to eat."  The ultimate origin is the Latin word "manducare," also meaning "to eat."  The shift in meaning from "to eat" to "a place for eating" is a common semantic change in language.
