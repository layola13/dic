The word "kaitak" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a word from another language or a proper noun (like a name or place).  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible without further context.  To provide the requested information, I need more information about the origin and intended use of "kaitak".
