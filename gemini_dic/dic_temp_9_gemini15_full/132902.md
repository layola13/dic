The word "nonelects" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a particular field or context.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis as requested.  To help, I need more context where you encountered this word.  Was it in a book, article, or conversation? Knowing the source would help determine its intended meaning and allow for a proper analysis.
