The word "prehatred" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need to explore potential interpretations:

**Possibility 1: Misspelling or Blend**

It might be a misspelling or a blend of words like "prejudice" and "hatred."  If this is the case, we can analyze those individual words:

**Prejudice:**

/ˈprɛdʒʊdɪs/ | n. |偏见，成见 |Preconceived judgment or opinion, usually unfavorable, toward a person or group.  It often involves stereotypes and biases. | Example:  He showed prejudice against people from other countries. 他对来自其他国家的人表现出偏见。| 近义词: bias, bigotry, discrimination | 反义词: impartiality, fairness, tolerance | 名词


**Hatred:**

/ˈheɪtrɪd/ | n. |仇恨，憎恨 |Intense dislike or ill will. | Example: He felt hatred towards his enemy. 他对他的敌人怀有仇恨。 | 近义词: animosity, loathing, detestation | 反义词: love, affection, fondness | 名词


**Possibility 2:  Intended Meaning as a Prefix**

Perhaps "prehatred" is intended to function as a word where "pre-" acts as a prefix meaning "before" or "in anticipation of."  In this case, it would suggest a feeling of hatred *before* any direct interaction or provocation.  This would be a newly coined word with no standard usage or definition.


**Conclusion**

Without further context or clarification on the intended meaning of "prehatred," a detailed analysis as requested is not feasible.  The provided format is applicable only to existing words with established definitions and usage.  If you can provide more information about where you encountered this word or what you intended it to mean, a more accurate analysis can be given.
