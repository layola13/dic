词源:

The word "gamophyllous" is derived from Greek:

* **γᾰμός (gamos):**  meaning "marriage," "union," or "joining."  This refers to the fusion of the petals.
* **φύλλον (phyllon):** meaning "leaf."  In botany, petals are considered modified leaves.
* **-ous:**  a suffix forming adjectives.

Therefore, gamophyllous literally means "having joined leaves" or "having united petals" in its botanical context.
