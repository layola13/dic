词源:
The word "de-power" is a relatively modern coinage, formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to deprive of") to the noun "power".  It reflects a growing awareness of the dynamics of power and the deliberate actions taken to reduce or eliminate it.  The word's usage increased significantly in the latter half of the 20th century and continues to be used in contemporary discussions of politics, social movements, and technology.
