英文解析:The word "non-totalitarian" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "totalitarian."  Totalitarian regimes are characterized by absolute control over all aspects of life, including political, economic, social, and cultural spheres.  A non-totalitarian system, conversely, allows for a degree of freedom and pluralism.
