词源:
The word "flip-flop" as a noun describing a type of sandal is a relatively recent coinage, likely arising from the sound the sandal makes when walking.  The verb sense of "to change one's mind repeatedly" emerged later, likely as an onomatopoeic extension of the noun meaning.  The sound imitates the quick, back-and-forth movement.
