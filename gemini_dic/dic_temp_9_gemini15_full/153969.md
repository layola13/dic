词源：
The word "perfectional" is derived from the word "perfection," which comes from the Old French word "perfection" and ultimately from the Latin word "perfectio," meaning "completion," "perfection," or "accomplishment."  The suffix "-al" is added to form the adjective.  Therefore, "perfectional" literally means "relating to perfection."
