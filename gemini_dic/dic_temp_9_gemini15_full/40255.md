词源:
The word "continently" derives from the Latin word "continens," meaning "restraining," "holding back," or "containing."  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb.  The connection to the word "continent" (referring to a large landmass) is indirect, stemming from the shared root meaning of "holding together" or "restrained."
