WORD ORIGIN->

Engrossingness derives from the verb "engross," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "engrosser," meaning "to write in large letters,"  "to make engrossed," or "to occupy completely."  The "-ness" suffix is a common English suffix that transforms adjectives or verbs into nouns, indicating a state, quality, or condition.  Therefore, "engrossingness" signifies the quality or state of being engrossing, or captivatingly interesting.
