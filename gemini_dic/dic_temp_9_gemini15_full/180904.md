The word "reiced" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a newly coined word, or a word from a very specialized field.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide the analysis, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered this word.
