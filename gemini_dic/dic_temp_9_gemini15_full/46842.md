词源:
From dapper (adjective) + -ness (suffix).  "Dapper" itself ultimately derives from the Dutch word "dapper," meaning "brave, bold."  However, the current meaning of "neat and trim in appearance" evolved later, likely influenced by the association of bravery with a certain stylishness and self-assurance in dress.
