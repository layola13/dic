self-consistently:/ˌsɛlf kənˈsɪstəntli/| adv. |自洽地；前后一致地 |In a manner that is logically consistent within itself; without internal contradictions.  It describes a system or process that is internally consistent and doesn't rely on external factors for its validity.|例句：The theory is self-consistently developed from first principles.  该理论是从第一性原理自洽地发展而来的。


The model's parameters were adjusted self-consistently until convergence was achieved. 模型的参数经过自洽调整，直到达到收敛。|近义词：coherently, logically, consistently |反义词：inconsistently, contradictorily

词源:

* **self-**:  From Old English *self, *sylf, meaning "self, same."
* **consistent**: From Latin *consistere, meaning "to stand together," formed from *con- ("together") + *sistere ("to stand").  The sense of "harmonious" or "logical" developed later.
* **-ly**: An adverbial suffix, indicating manner.

用法说明:

The adverb "self-consistently" is primarily used in scientific and technical contexts, particularly in fields like physics, mathematics, and computer science.  It describes a system, model, or process where the internal logic or relationships do not contradict each other.  A self-consistent solution is one that satisfies all the conditions or equations within the system without needing external input or adjustments.

例句：

*The numerical method converges self-consistently to a unique solution.* 数值方法自洽地收敛到唯一解。

*The equations were solved self-consistently using an iterative approach.* 方程组使用迭代方法自洽求解。


The term is often used in conjunction with iterative processes where initial guesses are refined until the resulting solution is internally consistent.  If a system is not self-consistent, it indicates a flaw or error in the underlying assumptions or calculations.
