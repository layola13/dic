将来时:
The addition of this substance will likely introduce an interferant. = 添加这种物质可能会引入干扰物。
We predict that the new interferant will cause problems. = 我们预测新的干扰物会造成问题。


虚拟语气:
If there were no interferants, the experiment would be more accurate. = 如果没有干扰物，实验会更准确。
I wish the sample hadn't been contaminated by an interferant. = 我希望样品没有被干扰物污染。

被动语态:
The experiment was affected by an unknown interferant. = 实验受到了未知干扰物的影响。
The results were compromised by the presence of interferants. = 结果因干扰物的存在而受到损害。

疑问句:
Is there an interferant present in the solution? = 溶液中是否存在干扰物？
What kind of interferant could cause this error? = 什么样的干扰物会导致这个错误？


否定句:
There were no significant interferants detected. = 没有检测到明显的干扰物。
