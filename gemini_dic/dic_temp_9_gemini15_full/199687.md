siphonarid:/ˈsaɪfənərɪd/| n. |虹吸螺 |A siphonarid is a type of small, limpet-like sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Siphonariidae. They are characterized by their simple, cone-shaped shells and their ability to breathe air, making them well-suited to intertidal zones.  They are often found clinging to rocks in the intertidal zone.  |例句：The rocky intertidal zone was teeming with siphonarid limpets.  岩石潮间带挤满了虹吸螺。
The researchers studied the respiratory adaptations of siphonarid snails. 研究人员研究了虹吸螺的呼吸适应性。|近义词：limpet (though not all limpets are siphonarids)|反义词：无 |名词
