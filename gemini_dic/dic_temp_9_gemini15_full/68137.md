fahrenheit-scale: /ˈfærənhaɪt skeɪl/| n. |华氏温标|The Fahrenheit scale is a temperature scale based on the freezing and boiling points of water at 32 and 212 degrees respectively.  It is named after the German-born physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit, who proposed it in 1724.  The scale is still used in the United States, but the Celsius (or centigrade) scale is predominantly used in the rest of the world. |The recipe calls for the oven to be preheated to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.  华氏350度预热烤箱。|近义词:temperature scale,  Fahrenheit system |反义词: Celsius scale, centigrade scale
