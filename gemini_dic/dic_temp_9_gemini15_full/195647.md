semiresolutenesses:/ˌsɛmiˌrɛzəˈluːtnəsɪz/| n. |半坚决；半下定决心；犹豫不决的状态|The word "semiresolutenesses" is extremely rare and not found in standard dictionaries. It's a complex, artificial-sounding noun formed by combining "semi-" (half, partly), "resolute" (firmly determined), and "-nesses" (a suffix indicating a plural of qualities or states).  It suggests a state of being partly determined but also hesitant or wavering.  The word implies a collection of instances of this indecisiveness.  Because of its rarity, providing example sentences, synonyms, or antonyms is difficult and impractical. The word itself highlights the struggle between commitment and doubt.|例句： (由于该词极少使用，难以提供例句)|近义词： (由于该词极少使用，难以提供近义词)|反义词： (由于该词极少使用，难以提供反义词)|名词
