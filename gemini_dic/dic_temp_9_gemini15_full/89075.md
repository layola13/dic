In biology, often used to describe certain types of organisms, particularly ciliates, whose oral opening is not bordered by a specialized structure. | Example: "The holostome ciliate exhibited a simple, unbordered oral aperture." = “这个全口纤毛虫展现了一个简单的、无边的口器。” | 近义词:  (Depending on context) simple-mouthed, unbordered  | 反义词: peristomial | 词性: adjective


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The holostome ciliate feeds on bacteria. = 全口纤毛虫以细菌为食。
This organism is a holostome. = 这种生物是全口生物。

一般过去时:
Researchers studied the holostome's feeding mechanism. = 研究人员研究了全口生物的摄食机制。
The classification of this species as a holostome was confirmed. = 这种物种被归类为全口生物得到了证实。

现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several new holostome species. = 科学家们已经鉴定出几种新的全口物种。
The study has revealed important insights into holostome evolution. = 这项研究揭示了全口生物进化方面的重要见解。

过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the holostome's habitat was unknown. = 在发现之前，全口生物的栖息地是未知的。
They had already examined several similar organisms before identifying it as a holostome. = 在将其鉴定为全口生物之前，他们已经检查了几种相似的生物。

将来时:
Researchers will further investigate the holostome's genetic makeup. = 研究人员将进一步研究全口生物的基因构成。
We will publish our findings on the holostome's lifecycle. = 我们将发表关于全口生物生命周期的研究结果。

虚拟语气:
If it were a holostome, it would lack a peristome. = 如果它是全口生物，它将缺乏围口。
I wish I had known more about holostomes before starting this research. = 我希望在开始这项研究之前对全口生物有更多了解。

被动语态:
The holostome's morphology was meticulously analyzed. = 全口生物的形态学被仔细分析。
New holostome species are constantly being discovered. = 不断有新的全口物种被发现。

疑问句:
Is this organism a holostome? = 这种生物是全口生物吗？
What are the defining characteristics of a holostome? = 全口生物的决定性特征是什么？

否定句:
This species is not a holostome; it possesses a distinct peristome. = 这个物种不是全口生物；它拥有一个独特的围口。
The study did not find evidence supporting the holostome hypothesis. = 该研究没有发现支持全口假说的证据。
