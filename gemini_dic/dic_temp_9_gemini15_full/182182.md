remodulation:/ˌriːˌmɒdʒʊˈleɪʃən/ | n. | 再调制；重新调制 | The process of modifying an already modulated signal.  This often involves changing the amplitude, frequency, or phase of the original modulated signal.  It's used in various communication and signal processing applications to improve signal quality, efficiency, or security. | Example: The radio receiver performed remodulation to improve the signal-to-noise ratio.  无线电接收器进行了再调制以提高信噪比。|近义词：reprocessing, modification | 反义词：demodulation
