词源:
The word "meditativeness" derives from the verb "meditate," which comes from the Latin word "meditari," meaning "to think, consider, or ponder."  The suffix "-ive" forms an adjective ("meditative"), and "-ness" turns the adjective into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being meditative.
