The word "readvises" does not exist in standard English.  It's likely a misspelling or a non-standard coinage.  It *might* be intended as a combination of "re-" (again) and "advises" (gives advice),  implying a repeated or renewed advising. However, without context, its meaning is unclear and grammatically incorrect.  A proper word to use would be "re-advises" or "readvises" (though the latter is still unconventional).  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested is not possible.  To provide a helpful response, please clarify the intended word or provide the sentence where you encountered it.
