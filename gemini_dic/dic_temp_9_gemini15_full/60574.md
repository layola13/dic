elastomer:/ɪˈlæstəməːr/| n. |弹性体|A material that returns to its original shape after being stretched or compressed.  Elastomers are characterized by their high elasticity and ability to withstand significant deformation without permanent damage. They are often used in applications requiring flexibility, resilience, and shock absorption.|例句：Rubber is a common elastomer used in tires and seals.  橡胶是一种常用的用于轮胎和密封件的弹性体。

The seals in this engine are made from a specialized elastomer. 这台发动机的密封件是由一种特殊的弹性体制成的。|近义词：elastic material, rubber, polymer|反义词：rigid material, brittle material

USAGE->

疑问句:
What type of elastomer is best for this application? = 对于此应用，哪种类型的弹性体最好？
Is this elastomer resistant to high temperatures? = 这种弹性体耐高温吗？

否定句:
This elastomer is not suitable for high-pressure applications. = 这种弹性体不适合高压应用。
They did not use the correct elastomer for the job. = 他们没有使用正确的弹性体来完成这项工作。


PHRASE->
elastomer properties = 弹性体性能
elastomer compound = 弹性体化合物
elastomer molding = 弹性体模塑
elastomer seal = 弹性体密封件
synthetic elastomer = 合成弹性体


词源:
The word "elastomer" is a combination of "elastic" (referring to the ability to stretch and return to original shape) and "-mer," a suffix used in chemistry to denote a polymer unit.  Therefore, it literally means a polymeric material that exhibits elasticity.
