Etymology:

The word "nonsubordinate" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "subordinate" (meaning "lower in rank or position").  "Subordinate" itself comes from the Latin words "sub-" (meaning "under") and "ordinare" (meaning "to arrange" or "to order").  Therefore, "nonsubordinate" literally means "not under an order" or "not placed below something else in rank or importance".


Usage:

The primary use of "nonsubordinate" is in grammar, specifically to describe clauses.  It's less common in everyday speech than "independent clause" which is a synonym.


Example sentences focusing on grammatical usage:

In a complex sentence, the nonsubordinate clause expresses the main idea.在一个复杂的句子中，非从属子句表达了主要思想。

The nonsubordinate clause is often joined to subordinate clauses through conjunctions or relative pronouns.非从属子句通常通过连词或关系代词与从属子句连接。


Note:  Because "nonsubordinate" is primarily a grammatical term,  providing examples illustrating tenses, moods, or voice in the same way as the "what" example is not applicable.  The grammatical function of a nonsubordinate clause remains consistent regardless of tense, mood, or voice.  The tense, mood, and voice would be features of the verbs *within* the nonsubordinate clause, not of the clause's status as nonsubordinate.
