词源:
The word "sanitised" comes from the word "sanitary," meaning relating to public health.  The suffix "-ised" (or "-ized" in American English) indicates that something has been subjected to a process.  Therefore, "sanitised" means "made sanitary."  The origin traces back to the Latin word "sanitas," meaning "health."
