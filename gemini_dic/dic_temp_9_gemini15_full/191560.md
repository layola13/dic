scholasticism: /skəˈlæstɪsɪzəm/ | n. |经院哲学； схоластицизм |

英文解析：Scholasticism was the dominant philosophical system in medieval Europe, from roughly the 11th to the 14th centuries.  It emphasized reason and logic in interpreting Christian doctrine, using Aristotelian methods to resolve theological problems.  Scholastic thinkers aimed to reconcile faith and reason, often engaging in intricate debates and detailed analyses of religious texts and philosophical concepts.  Key figures include Thomas Aquinas and William of Ockham.  While highly influential in its time, scholasticism is now often viewed as overly abstract and detached from practical concerns.
