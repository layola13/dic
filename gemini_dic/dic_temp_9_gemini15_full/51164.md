词源:  From Late Latin *despotes, from Greek despótes (δεσπότης) "master, lord, owner," from des-, de- "out, away" + potēs (ποτής) "one who drinks" (related to the verb pinein (πίνειν) "to drink"). The original sense is of someone who controls the resources of the household (including people).  The evolution of meaning reflects a shift from master of a household to master of a state.
