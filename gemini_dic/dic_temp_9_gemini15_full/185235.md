retrades:/ˈriːtreɪdz/| n.|再交易，再买卖|The word "retrades" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a neologism or a misspelling. It seems to be formed from "re-" (again) and "trades" (transactions involving exchange of goods or services).  Therefore, it would imply a repeated or renewed trading activity. However, without context, its precise meaning is unclear. There is no established dictionary definition or common usage.|例句：The company engaged in retrades of its older inventory to clear space for new products. (公司进行旧库存的再交易以腾出空间存放新产品。) |近义词：reselling, re-commerce, second-hand trading|反义词：initial trading, first sale|名词
