The word "portcluse" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specific jargon or fictional context.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis.
