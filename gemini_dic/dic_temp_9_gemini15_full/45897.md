cutinization:/ˌkjuːtɪnɪˈzeɪʃən/| n. |角质化；木质化|The process by which cutin is deposited in the cell walls of plants, making them more resistant to water loss and pathogens.  It's a crucial process in the development of the plant cuticle, a protective layer on the epidermis.|The cutinization of the leaves helped them survive the drought.|近义词：cuticularization|反义词：None directly opposite, but processes leading to cell wall degradation could be considered the opposite.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
