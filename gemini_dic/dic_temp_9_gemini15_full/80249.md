词源:  The word "goff" is a variant spelling of "golf," ultimately deriving from the Middle Dutch word "kolf" or "kolve," meaning "club."  This term, referring to the club used in the game, eventually evolved into the modern "golf." The spelling variation "goff" is less common and largely considered archaic or dialectal.
