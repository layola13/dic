词源:
The word "fetish" originates from the Portuguese word "feitiço," meaning "magic charm" or "spell".  It entered English in the 18th century, initially referring to objects believed to possess magical powers. The sexual connotation developed later, in the 19th century, primarily through the writings of anthropologists studying non-Western cultures.
