multilist: /ˈmʌltilist/ | n. | 多列表；多列表的 | A multilist is a data structure that allows for the representation of multiple lists within a single structure.  It's often used in computer science to organize and manage data efficiently.  The specific implementation varies depending on the programming language or system. | Example: The software uses a multilist to store customer information, separating it into lists by region, purchase history, and contact details. |近义词:  nested list, hierarchical list | 反义词: single list, flat list | 名词

词源:
The word "multilist" is a combination of "multi-" (meaning many or multiple) and "list" (a sequence of items).  Its origin is therefore directly from the components of its meaning within the context of computer science and data structures.  There's no single historical etymological source beyond this straightforward composition.
