词源:  Derived from "marshal" + "-ship,"  "-ship" being a suffix denoting state, condition, or office. "Marshal" itself has a complex etymology, ultimately deriving from Old French "marechal," meaning "master of horse," from "mare" (horse) + "scalc" (servant).  The original meaning evolved to encompass various roles of authority and leadership.
