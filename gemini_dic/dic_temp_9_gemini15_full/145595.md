The word "overcondensed" is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the adjective "condensed," which comes from the verb "condense."  "Condense" derives from the Latin word "condensare," meaning "to thicken," "to make dense," or "to compress."  Therefore, "overcondensed" literally means "excessively compressed or thickened."
