例句：He won three games consecutively. 他连续赢了三场比赛。


近义词：successively, in succession, continuously, uninterruptedly | 反义词：intermittently, sporadically, discontinuously


词源:  The word "consecutively" derives from the Latin word "consequi," meaning "to follow," "to obtain," or "to achieve."  The prefix "con-" indicates "together" or "with," while "-secutive" relates to the act of following. The adverbial suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective "consecutive" into an adverb.


用法说明:

"Consecutively" emphasizes the uninterrupted and sequential nature of events or actions.  It suggests a direct and unbroken chain of occurrences, unlike words like "successively," which might imply a slightly less strict order.


The word is often used to describe numerical sequences, temporal events, or a series of actions.  It can also be applied to more abstract concepts.


Examples demonstrating various contexts:


1. Numerical Sequence: The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 are listed consecutively.  数字1、2、3和4是连续列出的。

2. Temporal Events: The lights flashed consecutively for five minutes. 灯光连续闪烁了五分钟。

3. Actions: He pressed the button consecutively three times. 他连续按了三次按钮。


4. Abstract Concepts:  The company reported losses consecutively for three quarters. 这家公司连续三个季度亏损。

5.  Contrast with "successively":  While both imply a sequence, "successively" might allow for slight gaps or interruptions, whereas "consecutively" implies a strict, unbroken chain. For example, "He held three jobs successively" might mean he had gaps between the jobs, while "He held three jobs consecutively" implies he moved directly from one to another. 他连续/相继做了三份工作。 (Consecutively implies no breaks, successively allows for breaks)
