词源:
The term "droopy drawers" is a colloquialism.  "Droopy" describes something that is sagging or hanging down loosely, while "drawers" is an older term for trousers or pants, particularly loose-fitting underpants.  The combination creates a vivid image of loose, ill-fitting trousers.  The term's origin is likely informal and its precise etymology is difficult to trace, but its components are clearly established words.
