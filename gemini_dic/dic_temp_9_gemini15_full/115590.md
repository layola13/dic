词源:
From Old French *marauder ("to plunder, to roam about"), from Old French *maraud (a vagrant, a marauder), of uncertain origin.  Possibly related to Old High German *muro ("murderer").  The connection between the meaning of "roaming" and "plundering" is likely due to the association of wandering groups with violence and theft.
