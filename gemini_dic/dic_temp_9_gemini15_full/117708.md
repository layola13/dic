词源:

The word "melancholiae" is the plural form of "melancholia," which originates from the Greek words  "melas" (μέλας), meaning "black," and "chole" (χολή), meaning "bile."  Ancient Greek humoral theory associated melancholia with an excess of black bile.  The "-iae" ending is a standard pluralization for words of Greek origin.
