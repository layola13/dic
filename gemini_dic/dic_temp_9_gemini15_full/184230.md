词源:

The word "resolution" comes from the Old French word "resolution," meaning "act of resolving, solution," which in turn derives from the Latin word "resolvere," meaning "to loosen, untie, dissolve, solve."  The Latin word is composed of "re-" (again) and "solvere" (to loosen).  The meaning has evolved over time to encompass the various senses present in the modern English word.
