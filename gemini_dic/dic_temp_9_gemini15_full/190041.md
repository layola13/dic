词源:
The word "sandlot" is a compound word.  "Sand" refers to the sandy soil often found in such areas, and "lot" refers to a plot of land.  Its usage reflects the informal, often improvised nature of the recreational spaces it describes.  The term arose organically in common speech, with its first recorded uses appearing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coinciding with the growing popularity of informal sports among children.
