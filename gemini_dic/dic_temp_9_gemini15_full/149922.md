词源:
The word "palletization" is derived from the noun "pallet" and the suffix "-ization," which indicates the process of making something into a pallet or using pallets.  "Pallet" itself has roots in Old French and ultimately from the Latin word "palea" meaning "straw," referring to the early use of flat platforms made from straw.  The "-ization" suffix is of Greek origin.
