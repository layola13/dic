词源:
The word "nincompoop" itself is of uncertain origin, possibly a blend of words suggesting incompetence or foolishness.  The suffix "-ish" simply adds an adjectival quality, meaning "like" or "having the characteristics of".  Therefore, "nincompoopish" means "like a nincompoop" or "having the characteristics of a nincompoop".
