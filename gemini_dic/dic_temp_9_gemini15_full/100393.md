intersubstitution: /ˌɪntərˌsʌbsɪˈtjuːʃən/ | n. | 交换替代；互换；互代 | The replacement of one atom or molecule by another in a crystal lattice or chemical compound. This process often occurs in solid-state chemistry and materials science, leading to changes in the material's properties.  | Example: The intersubstitution of silicon and germanium atoms in a semiconductor crystal can alter its electrical conductivity.  硅和锗原子在半导体晶体中的互换可以改变其电导率。|近义词：substitution, replacement, interchange | 反义词：addition, insertion
