词源:
The word "decline" comes from the Old French word "decliner," meaning "to deviate, to bend, to slope."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "declinare," which has a similar meaning, ultimately deriving from "de-" (down) and "clinare" (to bend, incline).  The sense of "refuse politely" developed later.
