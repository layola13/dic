英文解析:
Sure is an adverb and adjective that expresses agreement, certainty, or willingness.  It's an informal word, often used in spoken English. As an adjective, it means certain or definite. As an adverb, it means certainly or definitely.

例句:

Are you sure about that? 你确定吗？

I'm sure he'll be here soon. 我确信他很快就会来。


词源:
The word "sure" has its roots in the Old French word "seur," meaning "safe," "secure," or "certain." This, in turn, derived from the Latin word "securus," which also meant "safe" or "free from care."  The evolution of the word reflects a shift from a sense of physical security to a sense of mental certainty.


用法说明:

Sure can be used in various contexts:

1. Expressing agreement:

   Sure, I'll do it. 当然，我会做的。

   Sure thing!  没问题！


2. Expressing certainty:

   I'm sure it will rain. 我确信会下雨。

   Are you sure you saw him? 你确定你看到他了吗？


3.  Expressing willingness:

   Sure, I can help you with that.  当然，我可以帮你。

   Sure, you can borrow my pen.  当然，你可以借我的笔。


4. As a polite response:

   "Can I borrow your phone?" "Sure." "我可以借你的电话吗？" "当然。"


5. To soften a negative response (less common):

   "Can I have another piece of cake?" "Sure, but just one more." "我能再吃一块蛋糕吗？" "当然，但只能再吃一块。" (Here, "sure" is slightly ironic/conciliatory.)
