词源:
The word "nonoperative" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "operative," which derives from the verb "operate." "Operate" ultimately comes from the Latin "operari," meaning "to work" or "to labor."  Therefore, "nonoperative" literally means "not working" or "not requiring surgery" in this context.
