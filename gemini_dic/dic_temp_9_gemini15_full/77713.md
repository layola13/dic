gemmation:/dʒɛˈmeɪʃən/| n. |出芽；芽生；芽殖|The process of asexual reproduction in which a new organism develops from an outgrowth or bud due to cell division at one particular site.  This is common in many invertebrates and some plants.|Example:  Yeast reproduces by gemmation.  酵母菌通过出芽生殖繁殖。|近义词：budding, proliferation|反义词：fission (in the context of asexual reproduction)
