词源:  The word is derived from "miscegenation," which itself comes from Latin roots:  "miscere" (to mix) + "genus" (race, kind).  The term was coined in the 19th century and was used to describe interracial relationships, often with a negative and discriminatory connotation.  Its usage today is often avoided due to its problematic history.
