词源:
The word "foregathered" is a past participle of the verb "foregather."  It's a somewhat archaic word, combining the Old English prefix "fore-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") with the Old English "gaderian" (meaning "to gather").  The "fore-" element might imply a prior arrangement or a gathering in anticipation of something.
