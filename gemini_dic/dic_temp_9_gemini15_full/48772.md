deflater:/dɪˈfleɪtər/| n. |压缩器，放气者|A deflater is a device or program that reduces the size of data, typically by using compression algorithms.  It's often used in archiving and data transmission to save space and bandwidth. | Example: The software uses a sophisticated deflater to compress the large image files before uploading them.  该软件使用复杂的压缩器在上传大型图像文件之前对其进行压缩。|近义词：compressor, reducer |反义词：inflater, expander |名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The deflater compresses the data efficiently. = 压缩器高效地压缩数据。
This program uses a robust deflater. = 这个程序使用一个强大的压缩器。


一般过去时:
The deflater compressed the file in seconds. = 压缩器在几秒钟内压缩了文件。
We used a different deflater for this project. = 我们在这个项目中使用了不同的压缩器。


现在完成时:
The deflater has significantly reduced the file size. = 压缩器已经显著减小了文件大小。
They have implemented a new deflater in the latest update. = 他们在最新更新中实现了一个新的压缩器。


过去完成时:
The system had already used the deflater before the error occurred. = 在错误发生之前，系统已经使用了压缩器。
We had chosen the wrong deflater for the task. = 我们为这项任务选择了错误的压缩器。


将来时:
The new software will use a faster deflater. = 新软件将使用更快的压缩器。
We will need a more powerful deflater for this large dataset. = 我们将需要一个更强大的压缩器来处理这个大型数据集。


虚拟语气:
If we had a better deflater, the process would be much faster. = 如果我们有一个更好的压缩器，这个过程将会快得多。
I wish we had tested the deflater more thoroughly. = 我希望我们更彻底地测试了压缩器。


被动语态:
The data was compressed by the deflater. = 数据由压缩器压缩。
The file size is being reduced by the deflater. = 文件大小正在被压缩器减小。


疑问句:
What type of deflater is being used? = 正在使用哪种类型的压缩器？
Does this software include a built-in deflater? = 这个软件是否包含内置的压缩器？


否定句:
The deflater did not compress the file properly. = 压缩器没有正确压缩文件。
This system does not use a deflater. = 这个系统不使用压缩器。


PHRASE->
deflater settings = 压缩器设置
deflater algorithm = 压缩算法
deflater performance = 压缩器性能
deflater efficiency = 压缩效率
deflater initialization = 压缩器初始化
