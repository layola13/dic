half-consciousnesses:/ˈhæf ˈkɒnʃəsnəsɪz/| n. |半清醒的状态；迷糊的状态 |A state of being only partly aware; a dazed or drowsy condition.  This word is rarely used and often considered awkward.  It implies multiple instances of partial consciousness.|例句：The patient drifted in and out of half-consciousnesses after the surgery. 手术后病人时而清醒时而迷糊。


There is no commonly accepted single word meaning "multiple instances of partial consciousness".  The phrasing "half-consciousnesses" is unusual and grammatically awkward. It's better to use alternative phrasing such as "periods of semi-consciousness,"  "episodes of partial awareness," or "lapses into drowsiness."
