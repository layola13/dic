The word comes from the verb "remedy" (to cure, correct, or improve),  adding the suffix "-able" (capable of being) to create the adjective "remediable," and finally the suffix "-ness" (the state or quality of) to form the noun "remediableness."  The root traces back to the Latin word "remedium," meaning "remedy."
