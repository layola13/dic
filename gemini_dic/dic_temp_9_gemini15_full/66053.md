The word "exasperators" is derived from the verb "exasperate," which comes from the Latin word "exasperare," meaning "to roughen, to make rough,"  "to irritate." The suffix "-ator" is a common noun-forming suffix in English, indicating an agent or instrument of an action.  Therefore, "exasperators" literally means "those things that exasperate."
