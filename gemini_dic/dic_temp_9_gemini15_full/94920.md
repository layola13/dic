The word "in-leaf" does not exist as a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a newly coined word, a misspelling, or a term specific to a certain field.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a useful response, more context is needed.  For example:

* Where did you encounter this word?
* What was the surrounding text or conversation?

With additional information, I can help determine the intended meaning and provide a more accurate analysis.
