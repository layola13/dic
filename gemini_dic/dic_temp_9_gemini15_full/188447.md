词源：
The word "rude" ultimately derives from the Old French word "rude," meaning "rough, unpolished, uncouth."  This in turn has roots in the Latin word "rudis," which also meant "rough, unworked, unskilled, raw." The sense evolved from a physical roughness to a social coarseness.


用法说明：

Rude is primarily used as an adjective to describe behavior, language, or actions that are disrespectful, impolite, or offensive.  It can apply to a wide range of situations, from minor infractions of etiquette to major displays of hostility.  It is a subjective term; what one person considers rude, another might not.

The word can be used to describe people ("He's a rude person."), actions ("That was a rude gesture."), and things ("She sent a rude email.").  It's often followed by an "of" phrase to clarify who or what is responsible for the rudeness (e.g., "It was rude of you to say that.").

The intensity of "rude" can vary depending on context.  A slightly rude comment might be forgiven, while extremely rude behavior is likely to provoke strong negative reactions.
