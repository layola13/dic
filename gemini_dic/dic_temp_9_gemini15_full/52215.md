diathermanism:/ˌdaɪəˈθɜːrmənɪzəm/| n. |透热性；透热作用|The property of allowing radiant heat to pass through a substance.  It refers to the ability of a material to transmit radiant heat, specifically infrared radiation. Diathermanism is distinct from transparency, which refers to the transmission of visible light.| Example: Glass exhibits diathermanism, allowing infrared radiation from the sun to pass through, contributing to the greenhouse effect. 玻璃具有透热性，允许太阳的红外辐射穿过，从而导致温室效应。|近义词：thermal transmissivity, heat transmission|反义词：opacity (to radiant heat)


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in scientific and technical contexts, particularly in physics and materials science.  Therefore, grammatical examples using typical verb tenses are less relevant than explaining its usage within scientific descriptions.  Below are examples demonstrating its usage in scientific writing:

Example 1 (Passive Voice):
The diathermanism of the material was measured using a Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer.  该材料的透热性是用傅里叶变换红外光谱仪测量的。


Example 2 (Active Voice):
Researchers investigated the diathermanism of several polymer films to optimize their performance in thermal insulation applications. 研究人员研究了几种聚合物薄膜的透热性，以优化其在隔热应用中的性能。


Example 3 (Defining characteristic):
The high diathermanism of this window material allows for significant solar heat gain while maintaining visual transparency.  这种窗材的高透热性允许显著的太阳热量增益，同时保持视觉透明度。
