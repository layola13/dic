This word "hamminess's" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be an incorrect or non-standard formation.  It seems to be an attempt to make a possessive form of "hamminess," which itself is a noun describing excessive ham-like behavior (overacting, exaggerated showiness).  The double possessive ('s's) is grammatically incorrect.

Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis following your requested format.  However, I can offer an analysis of the individual components:


**hamminess:**

* **Pronunciation:** /ˈhæminɪs/
* **Word Class:** Noun
* **Translation:**  做作；夸张的表演；矫揉造作
* **Definition:** Excessive or affected display of emotion or theatricality; exaggerated or showy behavior.  It often implies insincerity or artificiality.
* **Example:**  "His hamminess during the awards ceremony was embarrassing."  他的颁奖典礼上的做作令人尴尬。
* **Synonyms:**  Affectedness, theatricality, ostentation, artificiality
* **Antonyms:**  Naturalness, sincerity, genuineness, authenticity


**'s (possessive):**

* **Pronunciation:** /z/ or /s/ (depending on the preceding sound)
* **Word Class:** Possessive suffix
* **Translation:** 的；所属
* **Definition:**  Indicates possession or belonging.


To use the concept correctly, one would say something like: "The hamminess of his performance was obvious," or "His performance's hamminess was undeniable."  Avoid the double possessive "hamminess's".

Since "hamminess's" is not a valid word, I cannot provide examples of its usage in different tenses or grammatical structures.  The grammatical aspects would apply to the correct usage of "hamminess," as described above.
