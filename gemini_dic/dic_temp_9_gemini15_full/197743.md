The word "{shikai}" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling, a word from another language (possibly Japanese, given the structure), or a proper noun.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical breakdown, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  To provide the requested information, please provide a correctly spelled English word or clarify the origin and intended meaning of "{shikai}".
