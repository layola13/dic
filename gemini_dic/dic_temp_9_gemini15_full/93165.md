ignitibilities:/ˌɪɡnɪtəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可燃性，易燃性 | The capacity or tendency of a substance to ignite or catch fire easily.  It refers to how readily a material will start burning when exposed to an ignition source.  The level of ignitability is influenced by factors such as the material's chemical composition, surface area, and the presence of any accelerants. | Example: The high ignitability of gasoline makes it a dangerous substance to handle near open flames.  汽油的高度易燃性使其成为一种在明火附近处理的危险物质。 The ignitabilities of different woods vary greatly depending on their moisture content and density. 不同木材的易燃性因其含水量和密度而差异很大。|近义词：flammability, combustibility |反义词：non-flammability, incombustibility |名词

词源:

The word "ignitibilities" is derived from the verb "ignite" and the suffix "-ability."

* **ignite:**  Comes from the Latin word "ignis," meaning "fire."

* **-ability:**  A suffix indicating capacity or potential.

Therefore, "ignitibilities" literally means "the capacities or potentials to be ignited."
