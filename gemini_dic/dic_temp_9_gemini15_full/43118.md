词源:
The word "coxswain" comes from the Middle English word "coxeswain," which is a combination of "cox" (a shortened form of "cockswain," meaning "ship's boy" or "cabin boy") and "swain" (meaning "boy" or "servant").  The original meaning referred to a young boy responsible for assisting the helmsman. Over time, the meaning evolved to denote the person in charge of steering a boat, particularly a rowing boat.
