The word "faithworthy" is a combination of "faith" and "worthy".

"Faith" comes from the Old English word "fæþ", meaning "belief, trust, confidence."

"Worthy" comes from the Old English word "wyrþe," meaning "deserving, valuable."


Therefore, "faithworthy" literally means "deserving of faith" or "worthy of trust."  It's a relatively uncommon word, with "trustworthy" being the more frequently used synonym.
