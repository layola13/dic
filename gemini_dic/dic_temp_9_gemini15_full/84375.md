The word "halis" does not appear to be a word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage explanation cannot be provided.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:** Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name (person, place, or thing) or a brand name.
* **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.
* **It's a word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.

If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, a sentence using it, etc.), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
