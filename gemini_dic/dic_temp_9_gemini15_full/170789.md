pseudodiploid:/ˈsuːdoʊˈdɪplɔɪd/|/ˌsjuːdəʊˈdɪplɔɪd/| adj.|假二倍体|Appearing diploid but having a chromosome number or genetic constitution different from a true diploid.  This often arises from polyploidy or aneuploidy where the number of chromosomes is not an exact multiple of the haploid set.  A pseudodiploid cell may show 2n chromosomes but not have the genetic material typical of a true diploid.|例句：The cancer cells exhibited a pseudodiploid karyotype, despite having undergone chromosomal rearrangements.|近义词：aneuploid, polyploid|反义词：diploid (in the context of a true diploid)
