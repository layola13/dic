词源:

The word "obnoxiousnesses" is derived from the adjective "obnoxious," which comes from the Latin word "obnoxius," meaning "liable to," "exposed to," or "subject to."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, indicating a quality or state. The addition of "-es" creates the plural form.
