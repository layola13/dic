consigne:/kɒnˈsiːn/| n. |指示；委托；托运；货物|The consignee is responsible for the goods once they arrive at their destination.  收货人对其货物到达目的地后负责。|近义词：instruction, shipment, consignment|反义词：sender, consignor


The word "consigne" is primarily a noun, though it can sometimes be used as a verb in specialized contexts.  It derives from the Old French word "consigner," meaning "to entrust, to consign."  The ultimate origin is the Latin "consignare,"  a combination of "con-" (together, with) and "signare" (to mark, to sign).  This reflects the original meaning of marking or signing something over to someone else's care.
