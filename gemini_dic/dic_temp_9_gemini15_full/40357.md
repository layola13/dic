contraction's: /kənˈtrækʃənz/ | n. | 缩写；收缩；（肌肉的）收缩 | The word "contraction's" is grammatically incorrect.  It's a possessive form of "contraction," indicating ownership or relationship.  The correct usage would depend on the intended meaning.  If referring to the possessive form of a contraction (e.g., "it's"), then the correct spelling would be "contraction's." If referring to multiple contractions, then "contractions'" would be appropriate.  | Example: The baby's contraction's were getting closer together. (Grammatically questionable, better phrasing is needed).  The contractions' effect on the sentence was to make it shorter. |近义词：abbreviation, shortening, reduction |反义词：expansion, lengthening
