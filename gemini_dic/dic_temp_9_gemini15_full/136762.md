词源：

The word "nonseparably" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adverb "separably" (meaning "in a way that can be separated").  "Separably" itself derives from the verb "separate," ultimately from Latin *separare ("to separate, sever, divide").


用法说明:

"Nonseparably" is used to describe things that are inherently connected and cannot be easily or logically separated.  It emphasizes the indivisible nature of a relationship or connection.  It is an adverb modifying a verb, adjective, or another adverb.  The word is relatively formal and less common than synonyms like "inseparably" or "inextricably."
