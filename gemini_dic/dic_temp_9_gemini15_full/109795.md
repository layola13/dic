词源:
The word "levy" comes from the Old French word "lever," meaning "to raise" or "to lift."  This reflects the original meaning of the word, which was related to the raising of troops or the collection of supplies.  Over time, its meaning evolved to encompass the raising or imposition of taxes and other charges.
