The word "codding" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a regionalism, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specific technical field not widely known.


If you meant a different word, please provide the correct spelling.  If "codding" is a word you encountered in a specific context, please provide that context so I can attempt to understand its meaning and usage.
