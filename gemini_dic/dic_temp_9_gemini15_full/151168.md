The word "parcase" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* **It's a neologism or technical term:**  It might be a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field (e.g., a niche area of science or technology).  If this is the case, please provide more context about where you encountered this word.
* **It's a proper noun:** It could be a brand name or a place name.  Again, more context is needed.


Without further information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.
