词源:
The word "idealises" comes from the noun "ideal," ultimately derived from the Late Latin word "idealis," meaning "of or pertaining to ideas." The suffix "-ize" is a verb-forming suffix indicating "to make or become."  Therefore, "idealises" means "to make something into an ideal; to represent as ideal."
