词源:  The adverb "roundedly" derives from the adjective "rounded," which itself comes from the Old English word "rund," meaning "round."  The "-ed" suffix indicates a past participle, and the "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, conveying the sense of "in a rounded manner."  The evolution reflects the idea of something being complete or well-developed, like a circle.
