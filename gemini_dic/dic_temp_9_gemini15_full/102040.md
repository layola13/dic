WORD ORIGIN->
The word "isolationist" is derived from "isolation," which comes from the French word "isolement," meaning "isolation" or "solitude."  The suffix "-ist" is added to create the noun form denoting a person who adheres to a particular ideology or practice.  The concept of isolationism itself has roots in various historical and philosophical contexts, with examples found even in ancient Greece.
