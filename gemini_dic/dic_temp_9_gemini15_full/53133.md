diploidy:/ˈdɪplɔɪdi/| n. |二倍体，双倍体|The state of having two sets of chromosomes in each cell, one from each parent.  Diploidy is characteristic of most somatic cells in animals and plants. |Example:  Human somatic cells are diploid, containing 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). 人体体细胞是二倍体，含有46条染色体（23对）。|近义词：diploid  |反义词：haploidy


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The organism exhibits diploidy. = 这个生物体表现出二倍性。
Diploidy is crucial for sexual reproduction. = 二倍性对有性生殖至关重要。


一般过去时:
The scientist studied the diploidy of the plant. = 科学家研究了该植物的二倍性。
The researchers observed diploidy in the cell samples. = 研究人员在细胞样本中观察到二倍性。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered many organisms with diploidy. = 科学家们已经发现了许多具有二倍性的生物体。
Researchers have confirmed the diploidy in this species. = 研究人员已经证实了该物种的二倍性。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had confirmed the diploidy of the cells. = 实验之前，他们已经确认了细胞的二倍性。
The researchers had already known the organism's diploidy. = 研究人员已经知道该生物体的二倍性。


将来时:
Future studies will investigate the role of diploidy in evolution. = 未来的研究将调查二倍性在进化中的作用。
Scientists will analyze the impact of diploidy on genetic diversity. = 科学家们将分析二倍性对遗传多样性的影响。


虚拟语气:
If the organism were haploid, it would reproduce differently. = 如果该生物体是单倍体，它的繁殖方式就会不同。
If diploidy were absent, sexual reproduction would be impossible. = 如果没有二倍性，有性生殖将是不可能的。


被动语态:
Diploidy was observed in the experiment. = 在实验中观察到了二倍性。
The mechanism of diploidy is being studied extensively. = 二倍性的机制正在被广泛研究。


疑问句:
Is this species diploid or haploid? = 这个物种是二倍体还是单倍体？
What are the advantages of diploidy? = 二倍性的优势是什么？


否定句:
The cell was not diploid; it was haploid. = 该细胞不是二倍体；它是单倍体。
The organism does not exhibit typical diploidy. = 该生物体没有表现出典型的二倍性。



PHRASE->
level of diploidy 二倍体水平
degree of diploidy 二倍性程度
diploidy and polyploidy 二倍体和多倍体
diploidy in plants 植物的二倍性
