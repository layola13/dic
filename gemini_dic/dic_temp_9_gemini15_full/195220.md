semiepically:/ˌsemiˈɛpɪkli/| adv.| 半史诗般地，略带史诗色彩地 |  Describes something that has some of the qualities of an epic, but not to the full extent. It suggests a grand or impressive scale, but perhaps lacks the complete scope or heroic elements of a true epic. |例句：The battle scene was depicted semiepically, with sweeping shots and dramatic music, but lacked the depth of character development found in true epic films.  这场战斗场景以广阔的镜头和戏剧性的音乐半史诗般地描绘，但缺乏真正史诗电影中的人物刻画深度。

The novel's ending felt semiepically resolved, a satisfying conclusion to a long and complex narrative, but not quite the earth-shattering climax one might expect from a true epic. 小说的结尾感觉半史诗般地得到了解决，是对冗长而复杂叙事令人满意的结尾，但并非人们对真正史诗作品的期望那样令人震惊的高潮。


近义词：grandly, dramatically, impressively, somewhat epically| 反义词：banally, simply, plainly, uneventfully

词源:  The word is formed by combining the prefix "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partially") with the adverb "epically" (derived from the noun "epic," ultimately from the Greek "epos," meaning "word," "poem," or "narrative").  Therefore, "semiepically" means "in a partly epic manner."
