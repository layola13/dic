Etymology:  The word "jobber" originates from the Middle English word "jobben," meaning "to strike," "to thrust," or "to poke." This likely evolved into the meaning of "to do piecework," then to "do odd jobs," and finally to the broader sense of a person who buys and sells goods in small quantities or performs various tasks for a living.  The evolution reflects the changing economic landscape and the increasing prevalence of small-scale trading and temporary work. The informal connotation of a swindler or con artist is a later development, stemming from the opportunistic and sometimes shady nature of some jobbing activities.
