/ɪmˈpreɪvələns/ | n. | 不流行；缺乏普遍性；稀少 | The imprevalence of that particular disease in this region is noteworthy.  |  rarity, scarcity, infrequency | prevalence, commonality, ubiquity | 名词


The word "imprevalence" is not a standard English word. While it's formed logically from the prefix "im-" (meaning "not") and the noun "prevalence" (meaning "the fact or condition of being widespread"), it's not commonly used or recognized in dictionaries.  It would be better to use alternative phrasing to convey the intended meaning.


Instead of using "imprevalence," consider these options, depending on the specific context:

* **Rarity:**  If you are emphasizing the unusualness or infrequency of something.  Example: "The rarity of the gemstone made it extremely valuable."
* **Scarcity:** If you are highlighting the limited availability or shortage of something. Example: "The scarcity of resources forced the community to ration supplies."
* **Infrequency:** If you want to focus on the fact that something happens infrequently. Example: "The infrequency of rainfall led to a severe drought."
* **Lack of prevalence:** This is a more direct and understandable way of expressing the opposite of prevalence. Example: "The lack of prevalence of the disease in the population suggests a successful vaccination program."
* **Uncommonness:**  A simpler and more readily understood word. Example: "The uncommonness of such behavior surprised everyone."


**Example sentence illustrating the intended meaning (using an alternative):**

The rarity of  that particular disease in this region is noteworthy.  =  该地区这种特定疾病的罕见值得注意。


Because "imprevalence" is not a standard word, there is no established usage across different grammatical tenses, voices, or sentence structures.  The grammatical examples requested in the format are therefore inapplicable.  The same applies to phrase examples.
