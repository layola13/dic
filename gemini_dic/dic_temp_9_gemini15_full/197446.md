sheepdog: /ˈʃiːpˌdɒɡ/ | n. | 牧羊犬 | A dog trained to herd and guard sheep.  Sheepdogs are intelligent and loyal animals known for their herding instincts and ability to control flocks of sheep. They often work independently, using their intelligence and agility to guide the sheep without direct human intervention. | Example: The farmer's sheepdog skillfully guided the flock across the field.  牧羊犬熟练地引导羊群穿过田野。| 近义词：herding dog, sheep herder (though this refers to a person)| 反义词：None directly applicable, but perhaps "wolf" (as a predator) could be considered a thematic opposite.
