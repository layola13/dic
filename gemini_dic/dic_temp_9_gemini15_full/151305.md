词源:

From Late Latin *parietalis, from paries "wall," from Proto-Italic *pariēs, of uncertain origin, possibly related to Proto-Indo-European *(s)per- "to spread."  The meaning evolved from "wall" to describe the parietal bones of the skull, which form part of the walls of the cranium, and later extended to other anatomical structures.

用法说明:

The word "parietal" is primarily used in a medical or anatomical context.  However, its broader meaning of "relating to a wall or side" can be used in other fields, though less commonly.
