/ˌsemiˌdɪˈfɛnsɪvnɪsɪz/| n. |半防御性；半防御状态的复数形式 |The word "semidefensivenesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a non-standard pluralization of "semidefensiveness," which itself is a relatively uncommon word.  It combines the prefix "semi-" (meaning half or partly) with "defensiveness" (the state of being defensive).  Therefore, "semidefensivenesses" could be interpreted as referring to multiple instances of a partially defensive state or attitude. However, its usage is highly unlikely and should be avoided in formal writing.  A more appropriate word would be "defensive postures" or "defensive strategies". |The team displayed various semidefensivenesses during the negotiation, sometimes cooperating, sometimes holding back. (This sentence uses the word, but it's grammatically correct, albeit unusual and unnatural)|defensive maneuvers, protective measures|offensive actions, aggressive postures|n.
