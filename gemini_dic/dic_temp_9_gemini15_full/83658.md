haemosiderin: /ˌhiːmoʊˈsaɪdərɪn/ | n. |含铁血黄素| A brown-yellow granular pigment derived from the breakdown of hemoglobin. It is composed of iron and protein and is found in tissues where there has been hemorrhage (bleeding).  Its presence indicates previous bleeding.  | Example:  Hemosiderin deposition in the lungs is a common finding in patients with pulmonary hemosiderosis. 肺部含铁血黄素沉积是患有肺含铁血黄素沉着症患者的常见发现。

|近义词: ferritin, hemosiderosis (related condition)|反义词: none (no direct antonym)|词性:noun
