词源:
The word "canapé" comes from the French word "canapé," meaning "sofa" or "couch."  The culinary use evolved from the idea of small, easily-eaten snacks that could be consumed while socializing, much like one might relax on a canapé (sofa).  The plural is "canapés" (though sometimes "canapes" is used).
