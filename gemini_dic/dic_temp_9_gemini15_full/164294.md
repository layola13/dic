词源:

The word is a combination of:

* **pre-:**  A prefix meaning "before" or "in front of".
* **economic:** Relating to the economy or economics.
* **-ally:** An adverbial suffix, changing the adjective "economic" to an adverbial form, acting as an adjective in this case.


The word is formed by combining the prefix "pre-" indicating a time before something, with the adjective "economic" to create a descriptive term for conditions existing before formal economic systems.
