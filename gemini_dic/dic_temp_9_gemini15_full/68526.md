词源:  From Middle English *fanciful, from Old French *fantasie, from Late Latin *phantasia, from Greek *phantasia (“imagination, appearance”), from *phainein (“to show, appear”).  The evolution reflects the shift from the literal meaning of "appearance" to the more abstract sense of "imagination" and then to the connotations of whimsical or unrealistic fancy.
