The word "imperian" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage description cannot be provided.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* **It's a neologism:** It could be a newly coined word, specific to a certain field or community, or even a made-up word.
* **It's from a different language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.

If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, the surrounding text, etc.), I might be able to offer a more informed guess.
