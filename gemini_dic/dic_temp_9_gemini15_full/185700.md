词源:
reversibly is derived from the adjective "reversible," which in turn comes from the verb "reverse," meaning "to turn or move backward."  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner in which something is done.  The root of "reverse" is from Old French "reverser," from Latin "revertere," from "re-" (back) + "vertere" (to turn).
