词源:

The word "generous" originates from the Old French word "genereus," which itself comes from the Latin word "generosus."  "Generosus" is derived from "genus," meaning "race," "family," or "kind."  The original sense implied nobility of birth and spirit, suggesting that generous individuals possessed qualities characteristic of their noble lineage. Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the freely giving nature associated with such nobility.
