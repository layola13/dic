词源:
The word "comeliness" originates from the Middle English word "comeliche," meaning "handsome, beautiful." This, in turn, derives from the Old English "cuman" meaning "to come" and "-lic" meaning "like." The original sense likely referred to something pleasing to the eye, something that "comes" to please the viewer.  Over time, the meaning evolved to focus more specifically on physical attractiveness and grace.
