silicification:/ˌsɪlɪsɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/| n. |硅化作用；硅化|The process by which siliceous material is deposited in the pores or cavities of a rock or other material, replacing or filling them with silica.  This process often leads to the hardening and preservation of organic matter, such as wood or fossils.|例句：The silicification of the petrified forest preserved the ancient trees in remarkable detail.  硅化作用使石化森林中的古树以惊人的细节保存下来。
The silicification of the sedimentary rock created a durable, resistant layer. 沉积岩的硅化作用创造了一个坚固耐用的岩层。|近义词：petrification, mineralization|反义词：decomposition, dissolution|


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Silicification occurs in various geological settings. = 硅化作用发生在各种地质环境中。
The process of silicification requires specific conditions. = 硅化作用需要特定的条件。


一般过去时:
Silicification transformed the wood into stone. = 硅化作用将木材变成了石头。
Scientists studied the silicification of the fossils. = 科学家研究了化石的硅化作用。


现在完成时:
Geologists have observed silicification in many areas. = 地质学家在许多地区都观察到硅化作用。
Researchers have determined the factors influencing silicification. = 研究人员已经确定了影响硅化作用的因素。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, little was known about the silicification process. = 在发现之前，人们对硅化作用的过程知之甚少。

否定句:
Silicification did not occur in all areas of the formation. = 并非地层的所有区域都发生了硅化作用。
The rock samples did not show any evidence of silicification. = 岩石样品没有显示任何硅化作用的证据。
