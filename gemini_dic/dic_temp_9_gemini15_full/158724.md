词源:

The word "ploughland" is a compound word formed from two Old English roots:

* **plough:**  From Old English *plōh*, ultimately of Germanic origin, related to words meaning "to turn, to plow."
* **land:** From Old English *land*, meaning "land, ground, soil."


用法说明:

Ploughland is primarily used in agricultural contexts to refer to land that is suitable and used for farming. It emphasizes the act of plowing as a necessary preparation for cultivation.  The term suggests fertile soil and the possibility of crop production.  It is less commonly used than "farmland" or "arable land" in everyday conversation but remains a precise term in agricultural writing and discussions.
