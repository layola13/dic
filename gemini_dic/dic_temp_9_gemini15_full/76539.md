词源:  The word "gallant" ultimately derives from the Old French word "galant," meaning "lover," "gallant man," or "brave."  This in turn traces back to the Vulgar Latin word *gallus, meaning "cock," or "a proud, showy person." The modern meaning evolved through associations of bravery and courtship associated with medieval knights.
