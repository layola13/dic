melilite: /ˈmɛləlaɪt/ | n. | 熔沸石 | A sorosilicate mineral, typically yellowish-brown to greenish-yellow, found in volcanic rocks.  It's a calcium-aluminum silicate with a complex chemical composition.  The crystal structure is characterized by isolated Si2O7 groups. | Example: Melilite is a common mineral in some types of basalt.  熔沸石是某些类型的玄武岩中常见的矿物。 | Near synonyms: gehlenite (a specific type of melilite), åkermanite (another specific type of melilite) | Antonyms:  (No direct antonyms, as it's a specific mineral) | Noun
