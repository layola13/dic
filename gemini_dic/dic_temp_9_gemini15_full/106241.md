The word "nobody" does not fit the requested format as it is a single word and doesn't have the grammatical variations and phrases like "what"  demonstrated in the example.  "Nobody" is a pronoun, not a verb, noun, adjective or interjection that could be conjugated.  I can, however, provide the requested information for "nobody".


nobody: /ˈnoʊbɑːdi/ | pron. | 没有人；无人 |  A pronoun referring to no person. It is used to indicate the absence of people or a lack of someone. |  例句：Nobody was at home. 没有人在家。  Nobody knows the answer. 没有人知道答案。 | 近义词：no one, none | 反义词：everybody, everyone, someone


USAGE->

(Since "nobody" is a pronoun, it doesn't have verb conjugations.  It's usage is largely determined by the verb it's associated with.  The examples below show its use in different sentence structures.)
