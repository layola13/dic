laminable:/ˈlæmɪnəbl/| adj. |可层压的；可薄化的|Capable of being laminated; able to be formed into thin sheets or layers.  This term is typically used in materials science and engineering, referring to materials that can be processed into thin sheets or layers that can then be bonded together.  |例句：The manufacturer claims this new type of plastic is highly laminable, allowing for efficient production of multi-layered products.|近义词：laminate-able,  layerable|反义词：unlaminable
