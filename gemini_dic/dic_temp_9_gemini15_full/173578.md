quasi-immediate: /ˈkwɑːzi ɪˈmiːdiət/ | adj. | 几乎立即的，近乎即时的 |  Almost immediate; happening or done very quickly.  The term combines "quasi," meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent," with "immediate," meaning "happening or done at once." This creates a nuance suggesting a slight delay, but still a very rapid response. | Example: The system provided a quasi-immediate response to the user's query. 系统对用户的查询做出了几乎即时的响应。The feedback was quasi-immediate, allowing for quick adjustments. 反馈几乎是即时的，允许快速调整。| 近义词：nearly immediate, almost instantaneous, prompt, rapid | 反义词：delayed, slow, gradual
