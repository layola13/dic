The word "fady" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  If you can provide context (a sentence where you saw it, or the source), it might be possible to determine the intended word.

2. **It's a slang term or neologism:**  It might be a newly coined word, a regional slang term, or a word used within a specific community.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a name or place name.

4. **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.

Please provide more information to allow for a proper analysis.
