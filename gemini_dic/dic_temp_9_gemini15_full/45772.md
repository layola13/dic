词源:

The word "cusp" ultimately derives from the Latin word "cuspis," meaning "a point," "a spear point," or "a peak."  This Latin word found its way into Middle English via Old French.  The evolution of the meaning from a literal point to a figurative turning point is a natural extension of the visual imagery of a sharp point marking a transition.
