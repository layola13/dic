cyanine:/ˈsaɪəniːn/| n.|花青染料，花青素|A class of organic compounds that are characterized by a conjugated system of carbon atoms and nitrogen atoms. They are typically intensely colored and are used as dyes and in photographic materials. Cyanines are often used as sensitizers in photographic emulsions, extending the spectral sensitivity of the emulsion to longer wavelengths.  They are also used in various applications such as laser dyes, and biological stains.|例句：Many cyanine dyes are used in biological staining to visualize specific structures within cells.|近义词：dye, pigment|反义词：无
