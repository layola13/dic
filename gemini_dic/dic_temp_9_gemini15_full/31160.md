The word "chanek" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown is impossible.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A proper noun:**  It might be a name (person, place, or thing) specific to a certain region or context.
* **A neologism or slang:**  It could be a newly coined word or a term used within a specific community or subculture.
* **A word from another language:**  It may be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.

To provide the requested analysis, I need the correct spelling or more context about where you encountered this word.
