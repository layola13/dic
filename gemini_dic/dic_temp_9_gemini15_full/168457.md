probasidium:/ˌproʊbəˈsɪdiəm/| n. |担子果|A probasidium is a type of basidium, a specialized cell in fungi that produces spores. Unlike typical basidia, a probasidium undergoes meiosis (cell division) to form four nuclei, which then migrate into four separate cells. These cells then develop into basidiospores, the reproductive spores of the fungus. Probasidia are characteristic of certain groups of fungi, particularly some rust fungi and smut fungi.|例句：The probasidium of this rust fungus is unusually large. 这个锈菌的担子果异常大。|近义词：basidium (more general term)|反义词：N/A
