lithospheric:/ˌlɪθəˈsfɪərɪk/| adj.|岩石圈的；地壳的|Relating to the lithosphere, the rigid outer part of the earth, consisting of the crust and upper mantle.|The lithospheric plates are constantly moving, causing earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. 岩石圈板块不断移动，导致地震和火山爆发。|近义词：crustal, tectonic|反义词：atmospheric, hydrospheric


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The lithospheric plates are constantly moving. = 岩石圈板块不断移动。
This area is geologically active because of its position near a lithospheric boundary. = 由于该地区靠近岩石圈边界，因此地质活动活跃。


一般过去时:
Scientists studied how lithospheric plates interacted millions of years ago. = 科学家研究了数百万年前岩石圈板块是如何相互作用的。
The lithosphere experienced significant changes during the formation of mountains. = 在山脉形成过程中，岩石圈经历了显著的变化。


现在完成时:
Geologists have mapped many lithospheric plates around the world. = 地质学家已经绘制了世界各地许多岩石圈板块的地图。
Researchers have discovered a lot about the processes that shape the lithosphere. = 研究人员已经发现了许多关于塑造岩石圈的过程。


过去完成时:
Before the earthquake, the strain in the lithosphere had built up for centuries. = 在地震发生之前，岩石圈中的压力已经积累了几个世纪。
Geologists had already hypothesized about the existence of lithospheric plates before the theory was widely accepted. = 在该理论被广泛接受之前，地质学家就已经假设了岩石圈板块的存在。


将来时:
Scientists will continue to study the lithosphere to understand its dynamics better. = 科学家将继续研究岩石圈以更好地了解其动力学。
Future research will likely reveal more about the lithosphere's role in climate change. = 未来的研究可能会揭示更多关于岩石圈在气候变化中作用的信息。


虚拟语气:
If the lithosphere were more stable, earthquakes would be less frequent. = 如果岩石圈更稳定，地震就会减少。
I wish we knew more about the composition of the deep lithosphere. = 我希望我们能更多地了解深层岩石圈的成分。


被动语态:
The lithospheric plates are constantly being monitored by scientists. = 岩石圈板块正在不断地受到科学家的监测。
The theory of plate tectonics was developed to explain the movement of lithospheric plates. = 板块构造理论是为了解释岩石圈板块的运动而发展起来的。


疑问句:
What causes the movement of the lithospheric plates? = 什么导致了岩石圈板块的运动？
How thick is the lithosphere under the ocean? = 海洋下岩石圈的厚度是多少？


否定句:
The lithosphere is not a uniform layer. = 岩石圈不是一个均匀的层。
This area is not currently experiencing significant lithospheric activity. = 该地区目前没有经历重大的岩石圈活动。


PHRASE->
lithospheric plate = 岩石圈板块
lithospheric deformation = 岩石圈变形
lithospheric mantle = 岩石圈地幔
lithospheric strength = 岩石圈强度
lithospheric thinning = 岩石圈减薄
