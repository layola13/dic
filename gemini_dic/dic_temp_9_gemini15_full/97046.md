The word "infelonious" is derived from the Old French "felon," meaning "wicked," "evil," or "traitor."  The prefix "in-" intensifies the meaning, resulting in "infelonious" signifying a particularly wicked or criminal act.  The connection to "felon" (a person convicted of a serious crime) is clear, highlighting the gravity of the offense.
