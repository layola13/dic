词源:
The word "shamefaced" is a compound word formed from "shame" and "faced."  "Shame" comes from Old English *scamu, meaning "shame, disgrace," and "faced" is from Old English *fāced, the past participle of *fācian, meaning "to face, confront."  Therefore, "shamefaced" literally means "having a face of shame."
