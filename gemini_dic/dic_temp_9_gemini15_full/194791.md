The word "selve" does not exist as a standalone word in standard English.  It's likely a typo or a misspelling.  It could be related to the reflexive pronouns "myself," "yourself," "himself," "herself," "itself," "ourselves," "yourselves," or "themselves."  If you intended to ask about one of these words, please specify which one.  I cannot provide a detailed analysis using the requested format for a word that doesn't exist.
