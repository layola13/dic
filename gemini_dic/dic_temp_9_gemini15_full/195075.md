semicatalyst: /ˌsɛmiˈkætəlɪst/ | n. | 半催化剂 | A substance that partially catalyzes a reaction, increasing its rate but less effectively than a full catalyst.  It may also refer to a substance that initiates a process or reaction without fully catalyzing it. | Example:  The newly discovered compound acted as a semicatalyst in the polymerization process, accelerating the reaction but not as significantly as the established platinum catalyst.  | 近义词: partial catalyst,  promoter (in some contexts) | 反义词: inhibitor, catalyst (in the sense of a fully effective catalyst)
