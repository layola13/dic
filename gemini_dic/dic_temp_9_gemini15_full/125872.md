PHRASE->
(The word "muscle-bound" is not typically used in common phrases. It functions primarily as a descriptive adjective.)  It can be used with phrases such as:

词源:
The word "muscle-bound" is a compound word formed from "muscle" and "bound".  "Muscle" comes from the Latin word "musculus," a diminutive of "mus," meaning "mouse," likely because the flexing muscles resembled small mice under the skin.  "Bound" in this context means "tied," "restricted," or "constricted," implying a limitation of movement due to excessive muscle mass.
