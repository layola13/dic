词源:

The word "panic" ultimately derives from the Greek god Pan, a deity associated with the wilderness and shepherds.  Legends told of Pan causing sudden and overwhelming fear, a phenomenon later described as "panicked" or resulting in a "panic."  The association with sudden, irrational fear solidified the word's meaning over time.
