The word "{johnadreams}" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a proper noun, possibly a name or a username,  created by combining the name "John" and the word "dreams."  Therefore, a traditional lexical analysis as requested is not possible.  I cannot provide phonetic transcriptions, grammatical classifications, definitions, example sentences, synonyms, antonyms, or usage examples in various tenses and grammatical structures.
