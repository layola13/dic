反义词：scholarly, academic, professional, rigorous


词源:  The word is a combination of "quasi," meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent," and "scholastic," derived from the Latin "scholasticus," meaning "of or pertaining to a school or scholar."  Thus, "quasi-scholastic" literally means "seemingly scholarly" or "partially scholarly."
