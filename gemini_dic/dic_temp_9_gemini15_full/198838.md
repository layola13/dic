词源:
The word "sidelong" is a compound word formed from "side" and "long".  "Side" refers to a lateral position or direction, and "long" in this context means "directed or extending in a sideways direction".  The combination thus describes something directed or viewed from the side.  Its development reflects a natural linguistic process of combining existing words to create a more specific meaning.
