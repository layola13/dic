This word is not commonly used and is primarily found in specialized linguistic contexts.


Etymology:

The word is formed by combining:

* **non-**: a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of".
* **euphonious**: an adjective meaning "pleasing to the ear".  This in turn comes from the Greek: *eu* (good, well) + *phōnē* (sound, voice).


Therefore, "noneuphoniously" literally means "not euphoniously" or "in a way that is not pleasing to the ear".


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in descriptive contexts to characterize sounds or voices. Because of its relative rarity, providing examples across all grammatical tenses is less meaningful.  The word functions as an adverb, modifying verbs describing the production of sound.


Examples:

* The speaker articulated the words noneuphoniously, his pronunciation grating on the listener's ears. = 演讲者发音不悦耳，他的发音刺耳。
* The music played noneuphoniously, a jarring clash of dissonant chords. = 音乐演奏得刺耳，不和谐的和弦令人不快。


PHRASE->
