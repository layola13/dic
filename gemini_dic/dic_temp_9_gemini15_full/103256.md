词源：
The word "jewelry" ultimately derives from the Old French word "jouel," meaning "jewel."  "Jouel" itself has roots in the Latin word "jocale," which meant "plaything" or "toy,"  referring to the precious objects that were initially more decorative than practical. Over time, the meaning shifted to emphasize the precious and decorative aspects, evolving into the modern English word "jewelry."
