词源:
The word "scoundrel" originates from the Old French word "escoudeleur," which meant a "shield-bearer,"  a person who carried a shield.  The modern meaning developed over time, evolving from an initially neutral term to its current negative connotation.  The semantic shift likely reflects a change in the social perception of shield-bearers.
