词源:
The word "mariachi" has a somewhat uncertain etymology.  Several theories exist, but none are definitively proven. One popular theory suggests it derives from the Nahuatl word "mariache," meaning "marriage," possibly referring to the music's association with weddings.  Another theory connects it to a French term. Regardless of its precise origin, its use to describe this specific type of Mexican music became firmly established over time.
