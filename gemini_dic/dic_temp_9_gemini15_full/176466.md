The word "re-objects" does not exist as a standard English word.  It's likely a neologism or a misspelling.  It might be an attempt to combine "re-" (a prefix meaning "again" or "back") with "objects" (things).  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible. To provide a helpful response,  I need a clarification on the intended meaning or a correctly spelled word.
