词源:

The word "embezzle" comes from the Old French "embesiler," meaning "to make a fool of," or "to trick."  The word evolved to refer specifically to the act of misappropriating funds or property entrusted to one's care.  The "em-" prefix indicates an intensifying or encompassing action, while the root suggests deception and misuse of trust.
