词源:
The word "curbstone" is a compound word.  "Curb" comes from the Old French word "corbe," meaning "basket," which evolved to refer to a curved restraint. "Stone" has its roots in Old English "stān."  Therefore, "curbstone" literally means a stone that forms a curb or restraint, typically at the edge of a road.
