The word "gedd's" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (perhaps a surname or a place name), or a word from a specific dialect or jargon.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  To provide the requested information, I need a correctly spelled word or more context.
