词源:

The word is likely formed by adding the plural suffix "-nesses" to "reflex," which derives from the Latin word "reflexus," meaning "bent back," "reflected."  This suggests a connection to the automatic, involuntary nature of reflexes.  However, the addition of "-nesses" to create "reflexnesses" is unconventional and grammatically unusual in standard English.  A more appropriate way to express the plural would be to use "reflexes" or "reflex actions."
