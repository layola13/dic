quasi-ideally:/ˈkwɑːzaɪ aɪˈdiːəli/ | adj. | 准理想地；近乎理想地 |  Approaching or resembling an ideal; almost ideally.  It suggests a state that is close to, but not perfectly, ideal.  The term implies a degree of imperfection or deviation from a true ideal. | Example: The system functioned quasi-ideally under normal operating conditions. 系统在正常运行条件下运行得近乎完美。 | 近义词：nearly ideally, approximately ideally, almost perfectly | 反义词：imperfectly, ideally (as a contrast) |  词性:形容词
