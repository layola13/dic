/ˈθeɪliːn/| n. |酞类化合物，荧光素|A group of chemical compounds characterized by a phthalide ring system, often used as dyes or indicators.  Phthaleins are typically colorless in acidic solutions and colored in alkaline solutions, making them useful as pH indicators.  They are also used in some medical applications. |Phenolphthalein is a common example of a phthalein used as an acid-base indicator; it is colorless in acidic solutions and pink in alkaline solutions.  The color change is used to signal the endpoint of a titration. |近义词:indicator (in some contexts)|反义词: N/A
