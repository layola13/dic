词源:  From Middle English *castren, from Old French *castrer, from Latin *castrare "to castrate," ultimately from PIE *kastr- "to cut," with the sense evolving from "to cut" to "to turn" possibly through the imagery of a gate or door swinging on its hinges. The current meaning relates to the rotation of wheels, especially on vehicles.
