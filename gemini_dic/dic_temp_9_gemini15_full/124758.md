mro:/ˈɛmroʊ/|abbr.|方法解析顺序|Method Resolution Order|The MRO is an algorithm that determines the order in which methods are searched for in a class hierarchy, particularly in languages that support multiple inheritance. It ensures that methods are called from the most specific class to the most general class.|Example: In Python, the C3 linearization algorithm is used to determine the MRO.  Consider classes A, B, and C, where B and C inherit from A.  If a class D inherits from B and C, the MRO for D might be [D, B, C, A, object]. This means that if a method is called on an instance of D, Python will first search for the method in D, then in B, then in C, then in A, and finally in the base object class.|近义词: inheritance hierarchy, method lookup order|反义词: N/A


USAGE->
(MRO is an abbreviation, and thus doesn't have typical verb conjugations like "is," "was," etc.  Its usage is primarily descriptive within the context of explaining class inheritance and method resolution.)

Example 1: "The MRO of this class is crucial for understanding its behavior." = 这个类的MRO对于理解它的行为至关重要。

Example 2: "Python's MRO algorithm, C3 linearization, avoids the diamond problem." = Python 的 MRO 算法，C3 线性化，避免了菱形问题。


PHRASE->
(MRO doesn't have common phrases associated directly with it as it's an acronym denoting a specific algorithmic concept.)
