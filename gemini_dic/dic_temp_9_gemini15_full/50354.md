词源:  The word "depoliticization" is derived from the prefix "de-" (meaning "removal or reversal of"), the word "politics" (referring to the process or methods of government), and the suffix "-ization" (indicating the process of making something into something else).  Therefore, it literally means "the process of removing the political aspects of something."
