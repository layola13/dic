词源:
The word "counterfeiter" comes from the Old French word "contrefaitour," which literally means "one who makes a counterfeit."  The prefix "counter-" indicates "against" or "in opposition to," while "feit" relates to "made" or "done."  Thus, a counterfeiter makes something that is against or in opposition to the genuine article.
