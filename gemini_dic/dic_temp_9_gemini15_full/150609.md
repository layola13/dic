词源:
The word "paperweight" is a compound word.  "Paper" comes from the Middle English "paper," ultimately from the Arabic "babīr" (meaning papyrus). "Weight" is from Old English "wiht," meaning "thing, creature," later developing the meaning of "heaviness." The combination arose naturally from the object's function.
