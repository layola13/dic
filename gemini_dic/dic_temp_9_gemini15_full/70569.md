词源:  "Filled-up" is a combination of the past participle "filled" of the verb "to fill" and the adverb "up," intensifying the action of filling to completion.  The verb "to fill" has Old English roots, ultimately deriving from Proto-Germanic *fulljan.  The adverb "up" is also of Old English origin.
