词源:

The word "recoil" comes from the Old French word "reçoillier," meaning "to gather again" or "to collect."  The modern meaning developed from the sense of something springing back after being compressed or struck, later extending to the metaphorical sense of withdrawing from something unpleasant or frightening.
