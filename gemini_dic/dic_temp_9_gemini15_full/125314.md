USAGE->
This word is an adjective and doesn't have verb conjugations like the example word "what".  It describes a state of being, not an action.  Therefore, tense variations are not applicable.

PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "multihandicapped". The term is primarily used as a descriptor in clinical or social contexts.  It's more common to see phrases describing the *types* of disabilities, rather than the fact of multiple disabilities.  For example,  "visually and hearing impaired," "cognitively and physically challenged."
