indifuscin: /ˌɪndɪˈfjuːsɪn/ | n. |  吲哚菁绿 | Indocyanine green; a tricarbocyanine dye used in medicine for angiography and other diagnostic procedures.  It absorbs near-infrared light and emits fluorescence at longer wavelengths, allowing visualization of blood vessels and other tissues. |  Indocyanine green (ICG) is commonly used in ophthalmology to assess retinal blood flow. | 近义词：ICG (Indocyanine green) | 反义词：无
