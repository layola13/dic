词源:

The word "contradictious" is derived from the verb "contradict," which comes from the Latin prefix "contra-" (against) and the verb "dicere" (to speak).  Thus, the word's core meaning centers around "speaking against" or "opposing." The suffix "-ious" is added to create an adjective form, describing something characterized by contradiction.


用法说明：

"Contradictious" is primarily used as an adjective to describe statements, arguments, evidence, or even people who are prone to contradicting themselves or others. It implies a more inherent or habitual tendency towards contradiction than simply "contradictory," which describes a single instance of contradiction.  While often used interchangeably with "contradictory,"  "contradictious" sometimes suggests a more complex or interwoven pattern of inconsistencies.
