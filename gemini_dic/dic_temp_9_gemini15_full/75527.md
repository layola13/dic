This request is impossible to fulfill.  The prompt asks for a detailed analysis of the word "{fu}", following a specific format designed for analyzing the word "what".  "{fu}" is not a standard English word, and therefore doesn't have a standard pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or common usage within English grammar.  The requested analysis would be entirely fabricated.  To provide a useful response, a valid English word needs to be provided.
