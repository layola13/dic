castabilities:/ˌkæstəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可铸造性，可浇铸性 | The ability of a material to be cast into a desired shape.  This refers to the suitability of a material for casting processes, considering factors like fluidity, shrinkage, and ability to withstand thermal shock. | Example: The engineer assessed the castabilities of various alloys to determine the best material for the engine block. 工程师评估了各种合金的可铸造性，以确定发动机缸体的最佳材料。  The high castability of this aluminum alloy makes it ideal for complex shapes.这种铝合金的高可铸造性使其成为复杂形状的理想选择。 | 近义词：castability, moldability | 反义词：uncastability
