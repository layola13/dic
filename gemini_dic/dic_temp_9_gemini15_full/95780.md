词源:

The word "incontinency" originates from the Old French word "incontinencie," which itself derives from the Latin word "incontinentia."  "In-" is a negative prefix, while "continentia" means "continence," referring to self-restraint or control.  Therefore, "incontinency" literally means "lack of continence."
