词源:
The word "proselytize" comes from the Late Latin word *proselȳtus*, meaning "convert," which is derived from the Greek word προσήλυτος (prosēlytos), meaning "newcomer," "stranger," or "proselyte."  The Greek word is formed from πρός (pros, "to," "towards") and ἔλυτος (elytos, "loosed," "released," from λύω, "to loosen," "to release").  The original sense reflected someone who had been "loosened" from their former ties (e.g., to their former religion or community) and joined a new one.  Over time, the meaning shifted to emphasize the act of converting someone.
