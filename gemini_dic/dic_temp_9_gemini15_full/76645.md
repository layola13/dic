词源:  The word "galoshes" ultimately derives from the French word "galoche," meaning "wooden clog" or "sabot."  This term, in turn, has roots in the Old French "galoche,"  and possibly further back to a Germanic origin.  Over time, the meaning shifted from wooden clogs to the rubber overshoes we know today.  The plural form "galoshes" is frequently used, even when referring to a single pair.


用法说明：
Galoshes are primarily used as a noun.  They are typically used in the plural form, even when referring to a single pair.  The usage is straightforward and descriptive, referring to footwear designed for protection from wet and muddy conditions.
