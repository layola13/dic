词源:
The word "muddle" likely originates from the Middle Dutch word "moede," meaning "tired" or "weary."  Over time, its meaning shifted to describe a state of being confused or disorganized, likely reflecting the state of someone who is tired and unable to think clearly.  The connection to mud or messiness is a later semantic development.
