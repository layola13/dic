lcs:/ˌɛlˈsiːɛs/ | n. | 最长公共子序列 | The longest common subsequence (LCS) is the longest subsequence common to all sequences in a set of sequences (often just two).  It differs from the longest common substring, which requires the characters to be consecutive.  | 例句：The LCS algorithm is used in many applications, such as comparing DNA sequences. 最长公共子序列算法应用于许多领域，例如比较DNA序列。
| 例句：Finding the LCS of two strings is a classic computer science problem. 查找两个字符串的LCS是一个经典的计算机科学问题。|近义词：longest common subsequence (same meaning)|反义词：N/A|名词


USAGE->
There is no verb conjugation for "lcs" as it is a noun representing an algorithm or concept.  Therefore, typical verb tenses are not applicable.  The usage focuses on how the concept is used in sentences and programming contexts.


Example Sentences illustrating its use:

Sentence 1:  "The algorithm efficiently computes the LCS of two given sequences." = 该算法有效地计算了两个给定序列的LCS。

Sentence 2: "The length of the LCS indicates the similarity between the two sequences." = LCS的长度表示了两个序列之间的相似度。

Sentence 3: "We need to develop a more efficient algorithm to find the LCS in large datasets." = 我们需要开发一种更高效的算法来查找大型数据集中的LCS。

Sentence 4: "Dynamic programming is a common approach to solving the LCS problem." = 动态规划是解决LCS问题的常用方法。


PHRASE->
lcs algorithm: 最长公共子序列算法
