词源:

The word "self-analysing" is a compound word formed from:

* **self-**:  A prefix meaning "of or relating to oneself."  Its origin traces back to Old English *self*.

* **analysing**:  The present participle of the verb "to analyze," derived from the Greek word *analyein*, meaning "to break up," "to dissolve," or "to loosen."  This entered English via French.


Therefore, "self-analysing" literally means "performing an analysis of oneself."
