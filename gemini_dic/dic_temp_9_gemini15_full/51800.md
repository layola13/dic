词源:

The word "devoutly" originates from the Old French word "devot," meaning "devout."  This, in turn, comes from the Latin word "devotus," meaning "consecrated," "dedicated," or "devoted."  The suffix "-ly" is an adverbial suffix indicating manner.  Therefore, the word's history reflects a progression from a sense of dedication or consecration to a more specific meaning of deep religious feeling.


用法说明:

Devoutly is an adverb that modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.  It describes the manner in which an action is performed or a quality is possessed.  The core meaning emphasizes sincerity, earnestness, and often a strong religious element.  However, while often associated with religious devotion, it can also describe intense dedication to a cause or belief, even if non-religious.
