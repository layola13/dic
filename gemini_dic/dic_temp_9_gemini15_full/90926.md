词源:
The word "hurdle" originally referred to a light movable frame or barrier used as an obstacle in a race, deriving from the Old English word "hyrdle," which meant a "small gate" or "wicket."  The verb "to hurdle" emerged later, naturally extending from the noun's meaning.  The modern usage reflects the athletic context of jumping over hurdles.
