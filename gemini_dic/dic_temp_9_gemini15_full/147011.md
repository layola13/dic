词源:  The word "overlapping" comes from the verb "overlap," which is formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "above, beyond") and the verb "lap," meaning "to extend over or beyond something else," ultimately deriving from Old English *læppan.  The suffix "-ing" creates the present participle, functioning here as an adjective.
