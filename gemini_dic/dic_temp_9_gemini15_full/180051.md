词源:

The word "reflection" comes from the Latin word "reflexio," which is a combination of "re-" (back) and "flectere" (to bend).  It literally means "a bending back."  This refers to the way light or sound bounces back from a surface. The figurative meaning of thoughtful consideration developed later.
