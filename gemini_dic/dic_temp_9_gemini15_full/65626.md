词源:
The word "evangelising" comes from the Greek word "εὐαγγελίζεσθαι" (euaggelizesthei), meaning "to bring good news."  This is related to the Greek word "εὐαγγέλιον" (euangelion), meaning "gospel."  The English word "evangelize" entered the language through the Old French "evangelizier" and ultimately derives from the Greek root.
