词源:

From Late Latin *nōmadēs, from Greek νομάδες (nomádes), plural of νομάς (nomás) "shepherd, nomad," from νέμω (némō) "to pasture, distribute, allot."  Ultimately related to the Latin word "nomen" (name), suggesting a connection to the idea of people identifying themselves by their grazing lands.
