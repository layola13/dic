The word "grammarianism" is derived from "grammarian" + "-ism."

"Grammarian" comes from the Middle English "grammarian," ultimately from Old French "grammaire," and ultimately from Late Latin "grammatica," meaning "grammar."  This in turn is from Greek "grammatiké (téchne)," meaning "the art of letters," from "gramma," meaning "letter," "character."

"-ism" is a suffix indicating a doctrine, system, or practice.
