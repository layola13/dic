nonlocals: /ˈnɒnˌloʊkəlz/ | n. | 非局部变量，全局变量 | Variables that are not local to a particular function or block of code.  They are accessible from anywhere in the program.  In some programming languages, this might refer to variables declared outside of any function or block. | Example:  In Python, global variables are considered nonlocals.  | 近义词: global variables, external variables | 反义词: local variables


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The nonlocals in this program are poorly documented. = 这个程序中的非局部变量文档编写的很差。
These nonlocals are causing a conflict. = 这些非局部变量正在导致冲突。


一般过去时:
The nonlocals were not properly initialized. = 非局部变量没有被正确初始化。
We identified the problem as a misuse of nonlocals. = 我们将问题确定为非局部变量的误用。


现在完成时:
Programmers have often misused nonlocals. = 程序员经常误用非局部变量。
We have resolved the bug caused by improperly scoped nonlocals. = 我们已经解决了由范围不当的非局部变量引起的错误。


过去完成时:
The error had already occurred before we realized the nonlocals were the issue. = 在我们意识到非局部变量是问题所在之前，错误已经发生了。
They had not anticipated the side effects of those nonlocals. = 他们没有预料到这些非局部变量的副作用。


将来时:
We will use fewer nonlocals in the next version. = 我们将在下一个版本中使用更少的非局部变量。
The new coding guidelines will prevent the accidental use of nonlocals. = 新的编码指南将防止意外使用非局部变量。


虚拟语气:
If we had used fewer nonlocals, the code would be cleaner. = 如果我们使用更少的非局部变量，代码将会更简洁。
It would be better if we defined those as local variables instead of nonlocals. = 如果我们将这些定义为局部变量而不是非局部变量会更好。


被动语态:
The nonlocals were accessed from multiple functions. = 从多个函数访问了非局部变量。
The bug was caused by incorrect usage of nonlocals. = 错误是由非局部变量的错误使用造成的。


疑问句:
Are there any nonlocals in this function? = 这个函数中是否存在任何非局部变量？
Where are the nonlocals defined in this code? = 这些非局部变量在这个代码中是在哪里定义的？


否定句:
There are no nonlocals in this particular subroutine. = 在这个特定的子程序中没有非局部变量。
This code does not use nonlocals effectively. = 此代码没有有效地使用非局部变量。



PHRASE->
accessing nonlocals = 访问非局部变量
modifying nonlocals = 修改非局部变量
scope of nonlocals = 非局部变量的作用域
managing nonlocals = 管理非局部变量
avoiding nonlocals = 避免非局部变量
