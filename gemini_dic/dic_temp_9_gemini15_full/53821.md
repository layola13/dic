disconnecters:/ˌdɪskənˈɛktərz/| n. |断路器，隔离开关|A disconnecter is a switching device used in electrical power systems to isolate a section of the circuit from the power source.

Unlike circuit breakers, disconnecters do not automatically interrupt the circuit in case of a fault.  They are manually operated.|例句：The electrician used the disconnecters to safely isolate the faulty cable before starting repairs.  电工在开始维修前使用断路器安全地隔离了故障电缆。


The power was cut off by operating the disconnecters. 通过操作断路器切断了电源。|近义词：isolator, switch, breaker (in some contexts)|反义词：connector, coupler
