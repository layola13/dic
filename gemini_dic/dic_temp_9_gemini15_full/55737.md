The word "divedapper" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word, a misspelling, or a word from a very specialized or fictional context.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  To provide the requested analysis, I need a valid English word.
