From Latin *pecunia* "money," from *pecus* "cattle," originally used as a unit of wealth.  The shift in meaning reflects the historical use of livestock as a primary form of currency.


用法说明：

pecunial is primarily used as an adjective to describe something related to money.  While it doesn't inherently carry a negative connotation, it often appears in contexts where the emphasis on financial gain might be seen as overly materialistic or even greedy.  It's a less common word than synonyms like "financial" or "monetary," often used to add a slightly formal or literary tone.
