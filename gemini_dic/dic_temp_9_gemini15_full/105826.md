词源:
The origin of "kit" is uncertain, but it's likely related to the Old Norse word "kista" meaning "chest," referring to a container for tools or supplies.  "Caboodle" is of uncertain origin, but it is thought to be a playful alteration of a word like "caboose," adding a whimsical element to the phrase. The combination creates a lighthearted idiom emphasizing completeness.
