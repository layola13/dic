词源：The word "happenstance" is a relatively modern coinage, a blend of "happen" and "chance."  "Happen" derives from Old English *hapian, meaning "to happen, befall," ultimately related to the Proto-Germanic *hapōną. "Chance" comes from Old French *cheance, from Vulgar Latin *cadentia, a noun form of *cadere, "to fall." The combination of these two elements creates a word that emphasizes the unexpected nature of the event.
