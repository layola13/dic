词源:
The word "crusader" ultimately derives from the Old French word "croisade," referring to a military expedition undertaken by Christians to reclaim the Holy Land during the Crusades (1096-1291).  The term evolved from "crois," meaning "cross," symbolizing the religious aspect of these campaigns.
