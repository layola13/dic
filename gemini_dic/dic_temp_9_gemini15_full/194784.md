词源：The word "seltzer" comes from the German town of Selters (now Selters/Taunus in Germany), which was famous for its naturally carbonated mineral springs. The water from these springs was bottled and sold, becoming very popular. Over time, the name became associated with all carbonated water, eventually leading to the use of "seltzer" as a generic term.

seltzer通常用作不可数名词，但可以与“a glass of”, “a bottle of”等词搭配使用。  它主要指不含添加剂的碳酸水。  带有水果或其他风味添加剂的苏打水，则通常被称为flavored seltzer。
