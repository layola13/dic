nongenetically: /ˌnɑːnˌdʒɛˈnɛtɪkli/ | adj. | 非遗传地 | Not genetically; not relating to or caused by genes.  This adjective describes something that is not determined or influenced by genes.  | 例句：The observed differences in plant height were nongenetically determined, likely due to environmental factors.  这些植物高度的差异并非由基因决定，很可能归因于环境因素。

The observed behavioral traits were nongenetically influenced, suggesting a strong environmental component.  观察到的行为特征不受基因影响，表明环境因素起着重要作用。| 近义词：environmentally, nonhereditary | 反义词：genetically, hereditary | 词性: adjective


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The phenotype is nongenetically influenced. = 表型不受基因影响。
This trait is nongenetically determined. =  此性状并非由基因决定。

一般过去时:
Researchers found that the disease was nongenetically transmitted. = 研究人员发现这种疾病并非遗传传播。
The effect was shown to be nongenetically caused. =  该效应被证明并非由基因引起。

现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered that many characteristics have been shown to be nongenetically influenced. = 科学家们已经发现许多特征不受基因影响。
Studies have confirmed that the condition is nongenetically determined. = 研究证实这种情况并非由基因决定。

过去完成时:
They had assumed the variation was nongenetically based before conducting further research. = 在进行进一步研究之前，他们曾认为这种变异并非基于基因。
It had been previously believed that the phenomenon was entirely nongenetically driven. =  人们之前一直认为这种现象完全是由非遗传因素驱动的。


将来时:
Future studies will investigate whether this effect is truly nongenetically mediated. = 未来研究将调查这种效应是否真正由非遗传因素介导。
Researchers will explore the nongenetically induced changes. = 研究人员将探索非遗传诱导的变化。

虚拟语气:
If the trait were nongenetically determined, we would expect greater variability. = 如果该性状是由非遗传因素决定的，我们会期望更大的变异性。
If the differences were nongenetically determined, environmental factors would be the primary cause. = 如果差异是由非遗传因素决定的，那么环境因素将是主要原因。

被动语态:
The observed differences were shown to be nongenetically influenced. = 观察到的差异被证明是由非遗传因素影响的。
The results were interpreted as being nongenetically caused. = 结果被解释为由非遗传因素引起的。

疑问句:
Is this variation nongenetically determined? = 这种变异是由非遗传因素决定的吗？
Are these characteristics nongenetically influenced? = 这些特征受非遗传因素影响吗？

否定句:
The disorder is not nongenetically influenced; it is hereditary. = 这种疾病并非由非遗传因素影响；它是遗传性的。
The study did not support the hypothesis that the trait was nongenetically determined. = 该研究不支持该性状由非遗传因素决定的假设。


PHRASE->
nongenetically influenced traits = 非遗传影响的性状
nongenetically determined characteristics = 非遗传决定的特征
nongenetically inherited diseases = 非遗传性疾病
nongenetically based variations = 基于非遗传的变异
nongenetically controlled processes = 非遗传控制的过程
