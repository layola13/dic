词源:
The term "fogeyism" derives from "fogey," which itself has an uncertain etymology.  The earliest known usage of "fogey" dates back to the early 19th century, and its meaning has evolved over time.  While the precise origin is debated, it likely emerged as a slang term, possibly connected to words implying dullness, stodginess, or old-fashionedness.  The "-ism" suffix is added to form "fogeyism," indicating a system of beliefs or practices associated with being a fogey.  Therefore, "fogeyism" represents the ideology or set of behaviors associated with being a stubborn traditionalist.
