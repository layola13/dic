/ˌnɒnˈbɑːbərəsnəsɪz/ | n. | 非野蛮行为；文明行为 | The absence of barbaric qualities or actions; civilized behavior or state.  This word is extremely rare and largely theoretical;  it's a complex and somewhat unwieldy noun formed by combining "non-" (not) with "barbarousness" (the state of being barbaric).  It suggests a positive state characterized by the lack of barbarism.  There are few, if any, readily available examples of its use in common literature or speech.  |  The museum's exhibits highlighted the gradual shift from barbarousness to nonbarbarousnesses in the region.  |近义词:civilization, refinement, culturedness |反义词:barbarity, savagery, brutality |名词
