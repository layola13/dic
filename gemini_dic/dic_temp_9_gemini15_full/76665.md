词源:  The term is derived from the name of Luigi Galvani (1737-1798), an Italian physician and physicist.  Galvani's experiments with frog legs, which seemingly demonstrated "animal electricity," led to the development of the field of electrophysiology and the coining of the term "galvanism."  The application to the process of coating metal with zinc arose later, due to the use of electric currents in some early zinc-plating methods.
