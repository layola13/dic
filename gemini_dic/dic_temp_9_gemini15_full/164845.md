/ˌpriːfɔːˈɡɪvnəsɪz/ | n. | 预先的原谅；提前的宽恕 |  The word "preforgivenesses" is not a standard English word.  It's a neologism, meaning a newly coined word or expression. It appears to be formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before) and "forgivenesses" (the plural of forgiveness).  It suggests acts of forgiveness given before an offense has even occurred, or perhaps a collection of such acts.  Because it's not a standard word, there are no readily available examples of its usage in established literature or corpora.  Its meaning would need to be derived from context. |  (No standard examples exist. A hypothetical example follows:)  He offered preforgivenesses to his children, hoping to prevent future arguments. = 他预先原谅了他的孩子们，希望能避免未来的争吵。|  (No established synonyms or antonyms exist.) | n.
