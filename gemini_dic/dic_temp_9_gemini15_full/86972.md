/ˌhɛndiˈeɪdɪs/| n. |合体词，对句法|A figure of speech in which a single idea is expressed by two words joined by a conjunction, though either word could express the whole idea.  It's a rhetorical device often used for emphasis or stylistic effect.  The two words are often near synonyms, but the combination creates a richer or more nuanced meaning than either word alone.|The author used the hendiadys "loud and clear" to emphasize the clarity of the message.  |synecdoche, parallelism|  |n.
例句：

The phrase "sound and fury" is a hendiadys, as "fury" already implies "sound".  这句话“喧嚣与狂怒”是一个合体词，因为“狂怒”本身就暗示着“喧嚣”。

Shakespeare frequently employs hendiadys for stylistic effect in his plays. 莎士比亚经常在他的戏剧中使用合体词来达到风格上的效果。


词源:

From Ancient Greek ἕν (hen) "one" + διά (dia) "through" + δύς (dus) "two".  Literally meaning "one through two," reflecting the use of two words to express a single concept.


用法说明:

Hendiadys is primarily a rhetorical device found in literature and oratory.  It's not a grammatical structure in itself, but rather a stylistic choice.  The effect is often one of emphasis, amplification, or a more poetic expression of an idea.  Identifying hendiadys requires understanding the underlying semantic relationship between the two conjoined words.  Often, one word is implicit within the other.

注意：由于hendiadys本身不是一个语法结构，因此没有“时态”等语法范畴的例句。  例句主要关注其在文学作品中的运用。
