词源：

The word "inobtrusive" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the verb "obtrude" (meaning "to thrust oneself forward or impose oneself on others"), and the suffix "-ive" (forming adjectives).  Therefore, "inobtrusive" literally means "not thrusting oneself forward" or "not imposing oneself."


用法说明：

"Inobtrusive" is primarily used to describe something that is not noticeable, attention-grabbing, or intrusive.  It often implies a positive quality, suggesting something is subtle, discreet, and respectful of its surroundings or audience.  It's frequently used to describe things like:

* Design elements:  inobtrusive lighting, inobtrusive furniture
* Behavior: inobtrusive manner, inobtrusive presence
* Technology: inobtrusive security systems
* Music: inobtrusive background music


The word is often used interchangeably with "unobtrusive," although some might argue that "inobtrusive" implies a more deliberate effort to avoid being noticeable.  However, this distinction is often subtle and not consistently applied.
