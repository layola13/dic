词源：

The word "prediscernments" is derived from the verb "prediscern," which is itself a combination of:

* **pre-**: a prefix meaning "before" or "prior to"
* **discern**:  to perceive or recognize something.  This word originates from the Old French *descerner* and ultimately from the Latin *discernere*, meaning "to separate, distinguish, decide."  *Discernere* is composed of the prefix *dis-* (apart) and *cernere* (to separate, sift).

Therefore, "prediscernments" literally means "things perceived or understood before they happen."
