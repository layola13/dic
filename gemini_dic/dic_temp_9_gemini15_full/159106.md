词源:
The word "pocketability" is a relatively modern coinage, formed by adding the suffix "-ability" (meaning "the quality or state of being") to the noun "pocket."  It reflects a growing concern with the portability and convenience of everyday items.  The root "pocket" itself has a long history, deriving from Old French "poque" or "poche," ultimately of uncertain origin, possibly related to words meaning "bag" or "pouch."
