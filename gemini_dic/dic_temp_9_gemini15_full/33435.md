词源:
The word "churlish" originates from the Old English word "ceorl," meaning "a peasant, churl."  Over time, the word's meaning shifted to reflect the perceived roughness and lack of refinement often associated with peasants.  This negative connotation evolved into the modern sense of rude, bad-tempered, and ungracious behavior.
