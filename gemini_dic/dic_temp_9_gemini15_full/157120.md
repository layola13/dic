词源:

The word is a compound of "pinch," meaning to squeeze or compress, and "waisted," referring to the waist.  The "pinch" element highlights the extreme narrowness of the waist, suggesting a constricted or squeezed appearance. The term likely emerged in the fashion lexicon during periods when extremely tight waistlines were fashionable, such as the Victorian era or the mid-20th century.
