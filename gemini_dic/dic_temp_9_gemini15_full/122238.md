Etymology:

The word "miswrought" is a compound word formed from the prefix "mis-" and the past participle "wrought."

* **mis-**:  A prefix indicating bad, wrong, ill, or wrongly.  It comes from Old English *mis-.

* **wrought**:  The past participle of the verb "work." In this context, it refers to something that has been made or produced. It's an older, less common form, retaining a connection to the Old English *wyrcan meaning "to work, make, build."
