词源:

The word "operationality" is derived from the adjective "operational," which itself comes from the noun "operation."  "Operation" ultimately traces back to the Latin word "operatio," meaning "a working," "a labor," or "an action."  The suffix "-ality" is added to create a noun signifying "the state or quality of being operational."
