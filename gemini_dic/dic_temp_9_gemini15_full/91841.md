hypergraphs:/ˈhaɪpərɡræfs/| n. |超图|A hypergraph is a generalization of a graph where an edge can connect any number of vertices, not just two.  Unlike a graph, which consists of vertices and edges connecting pairs of vertices, a hypergraph allows edges (also called hyperedges) to connect any number of vertices. This makes them useful for representing relationships that are more complex than simple pairwise connections.| Example: A hypergraph could represent a group project, where each hyperedge represents a task and the vertices represent the individuals involved in that task.  One task might involve three students, another might involve only two.  This cannot be easily represented with a standard graph.|近义词：generalized graph, set system|反义词：graph (in the sense of a limitation)|词性:n.
