hysteretic:/ˌhɪstəˈrɛtɪk/| adj. |滞后的；磁滞的；具有磁滞现象的 | Exhibiting hysteresis;  characterized by hysteresis.  Hysteresis refers to the dependence of a system's output not only on its current input but also on its history of past inputs. This means that the system's response lags behind changes in the input.  | The magnetic hysteresis loop showed a significant energy loss. 磁滞回线显示了明显的能量损失。The material exhibited hysteretic behavior under stress.  该材料在压力下表现出滞后行为。|  lagging, delayed | prompt, immediate |
