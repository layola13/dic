The word "reerections" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are not possible.  If it was intended to be a word, the most likely intended word is "erections".  I will provide the analysis for "erections" instead.

erections: /ɪˈrɛkʃənz/ | n. |勃起，建筑物；竖立 |  The act of becoming erect; the state of being erect;  also, the act of constructing or building something; the things that are constructed or built. |


英文解析:The noun "erection" can refer to two distinct things:  a physical erection (the state of the penis becoming stiff and erect) and the act of constructing or building something (e.g., a building, a monument). The context usually clarifies the intended meaning.
