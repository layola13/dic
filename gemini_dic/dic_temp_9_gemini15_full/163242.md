This term describes a substance that has undergone a concentration process prior to its current state.  |  例句：The preconcentrated sample was analyzed using gas chromatography.  预浓缩的样品用气相色谱法进行了分析。

例句：The preconcentrated solution was ready for injection into the HPLC. 预先浓缩的溶液已准备好注入高效液相色谱仪。


近义词：concentrated, enriched, refined | 反义词：diluted, weakened


词源：pre- (prefix indicating "before" or "prior to") + concentrated (past participle of concentrate, meaning "to increase the concentration of")
