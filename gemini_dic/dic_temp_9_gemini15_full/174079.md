PHRASE->

The word "quasiwickedly" itself functions as a phrase, modifying verbs.  It doesn't have common multi-word phrases associated with it because it is descriptive adverb.  Instead, consider phrases it might modify:

Phrase 1:  smiled quasiwickedly (狡黠地微笑)
Phrase 2:  whispered quasiwickedly (近乎邪恶地耳语)
Phrase 3:  acted quasiwickedly (恶作剧般地行动)
Phrase 4:  plotted quasiwickedly (阴险地策划)

词源:

The word is a combination of:

* **quasi-**:  A prefix of Latin origin meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "as if."
* **wickedly**: An adverb derived from the adjective "wicked," meaning evil or morally wrong.


Therefore, "quasiwickedly" literally means "as if wickedly," or "seemingly wickedly."  It emphasizes the playful or simulated nature of the wickedness.
