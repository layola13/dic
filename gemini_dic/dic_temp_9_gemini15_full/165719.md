prenasal:/ˈpriːneɪzəl/ | adj. | 前鼻音的 | Relating to or denoting a consonant sound made with the tongue or lips in contact, partially obstructing the airflow, and with the velum lowered to allow air to escape through the nose.  It's a linguistic term describing sounds where nasalization precedes the main consonant articulation.  | Example: The /m/ in "lamp" is a prenasal consonant. 前鼻音/m/在“lamp”中是一个前鼻辅音。 | 近义词: nasalized | 反义词:  None specifically, but the opposite would be a non-nasal consonant.
