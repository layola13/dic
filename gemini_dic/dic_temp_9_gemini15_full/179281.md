Etymology:  The word "rendition" comes from the verb "render," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "rendre," meaning "to return, give back, surrender."  Over time, "render" acquired various meanings, including "to represent" or "to portray."  "Rendition," therefore, literally means "a giving back" or "a portrayal,"  fitting its meaning of a performance or interpretation.
