词源:  The word "leggy" is derived from the noun "leg" plus the suffix "-y," which is used to form adjectives indicating a characteristic or abundance of something.  The suffix "-y" suggests abundance or quality, hence "leggy" describes something that has noticeably long or many legs.


用法说明:

"Leggy" is primarily used to describe people or things that have long, slender legs. It can carry a positive connotation, particularly when describing models or animals, emphasizing their grace and elegance. However, it can also be used to describe plants or inanimate objects with long, thin stems or supports, sometimes with a slightly negative connotation suggesting weakness or instability.

The word is predominantly used attributively (before a noun), as in "a leggy dancer".  However, it can also be used predicatively (after a linking verb such as "to be"), as in "The plant has become leggy."
