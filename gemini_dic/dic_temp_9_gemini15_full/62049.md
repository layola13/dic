词源:
The word "encapsulate" comes from the Late Latin word "capsula," meaning "small box" or "case," combined with the English prefix "en-," meaning "in" or "into."  This reflects the literal meaning of enclosing something within a capsule, which has then extended metaphorically to encompass the idea of summarizing or expressing something concisely.
