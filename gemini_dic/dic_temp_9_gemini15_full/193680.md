词源:

The word "self-commendation" is a compound word.

* **self-**:  A prefix meaning "of, by, or for oneself."  Its origins trace back to Old English *self*.

* **commendation**:  This part comes from the verb "commend," which ultimately derives from the Old French *commander* and the Latin *commendāre*.  *Commendāre* is composed of *com-* (together, with) and *mandāre* (to entrust, order).  Therefore, "commend" originally meant to entrust or recommend something to someone's care.  Adding "-ation" forms the noun "commendation," signifying the act of commending.
