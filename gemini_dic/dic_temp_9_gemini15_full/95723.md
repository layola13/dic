PHRASE->
There aren't common idiomatic phrases directly using "inconsequentialities." The word itself is relatively formal and rarely used in informal settings.  Instead, phrases would incorporate the *idea* of inconsequentialities:

词源:
The word is derived from the adjective "inconsequential" (lacking importance) and the suffix "-ities," which forms nouns indicating a quality or state.  "Inconsequential" itself comes from the prefix "in-" (not), "consequential" (following as a result or consequence),  "consequent" (resulting), and ultimately from the Latin verb *sequi* (to follow).
