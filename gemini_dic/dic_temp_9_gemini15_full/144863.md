词源:
The word "over-process" is a compound word formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "process" (meaning to subject to a series of actions or operations).  Therefore, it literally means to process something to an excessive degree.  The etymology of "process" traces back to Latin "processus," meaning "a going forward," "advance," or "progression."
