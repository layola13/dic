词源:

The word "luridness" is derived from the adjective "lurid," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "luridus," meaning "pale yellow," "wan," or "ghostly."  Over time, the meaning shifted to describe something gruesome or ghastly, likely due to the association of pale yellow with the sickly appearance of a corpse. The modern sense of "sensational" or "excessively vivid" is a later development.
