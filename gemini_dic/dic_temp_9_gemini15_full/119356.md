词源:
The word "microclimatic" is a combination of "micro-" and "climatic".  "Micro-" is a combining form meaning "small" derived from the Greek word "μικρός" (mikrós) meaning "small". "Climatic" is derived from "climate," ultimately from the Greek word "κλίμα" (klíma) meaning "slope, inclination, region," which later came to refer to the general weather conditions of a region.  Therefore, "microclimatic" literally means relating to a small or localized climate.
