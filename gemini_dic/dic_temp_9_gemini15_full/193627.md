词源:  The word is a compound of "self" and "betterment." "Self" is an Old English word meaning "one's own," and "betterment" derives from "better," an Old English word meaning "superior" or "of higher quality," plus the suffix "-ment," indicating a state or process.  Thus, self-betterment literally means "the act of making oneself better."
