PHRASE->

There are no commonly used idiomatic phrases directly incorporating "presuggestion." The word itself is relatively uncommon and formal.  The usage focuses on its literal meaning.  Instead, phrases would revolve around the *act* of giving presuggestions, such as:

offer a presuggestion,  provide a presuggestion, receive a presuggestion, consider a presuggestion,  implement a presuggestion


词源:

The word "presuggestion" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and the noun "suggestion".  Therefore, its etymology traces back to the Latin "prae" (before) and the English "suggestion", which itself has roots in the Latin "suggerere" (to suggest).
