ganoidei:/ɡæˈnɔɪdiːaɪ/| n. |硬鳞鱼类；硬鳞鱼目 |A group of ray-finned fishes characterized by their ganoid scales.  These scales are rhombic (diamond-shaped), thick, and covered in a layer of ganoin, a hard, enamel-like substance.  They are often considered a paraphyletic group, meaning they don't include all descendants of a common ancestor.  Many extinct groups belong to this category, and some extant (still existing) fish groups are also classified here. |例句：The fossil record shows a rich diversity of ganoidei, many of which are now extinct.|近义词：none (as a taxonomic group, it's unique)|反义词：none (no direct antonym, but other fish orders could be considered contrasting groups)|词性:n.


USAGE->
There is no typical usage of "Ganoidei" in common sentences like "What" examples.  "Ganoidei" is a scientific term used in ichthyology (the study of fish).  Therefore, example sentences will reflect its scientific usage.

一般现在时:
Ganoidei are characterized by their ganoid scales. = 硬鳞鱼类的特征是它们的硬鳞。
The classification of Ganoidei is still debated among scientists. = 硬鳞鱼类的分类在科学家之间仍然存在争议。


一般过去时:
Scientists once believed Ganoidei to be a closely related group. = 科学家曾经认为硬鳞鱼类是一个紧密相关的群体。
Many species of Ganoidei went extinct during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. = 许多硬鳞鱼类物种在白垩纪-古近纪灭绝事件中灭绝了。


现在完成时:
Researchers have discovered many new fossil specimens of Ganoidei. = 研究人员已经发现了许多新的硬鳞鱼类化石标本。
The study of Ganoidei has revealed much about the evolution of fish. = 对硬鳞鱼类的研究揭示了关于鱼类进化的大量信息。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery of new fossil evidence, scientists had believed Ganoidei to be more primitive. = 在发现新的化石证据之前，科学家们认为硬鳞鱼类更为原始。
Paleontologists had already identified several genera of Ganoidei before the new species was discovered. = 在发现新物种之前，古生物学家已经鉴定了几属硬鳞鱼类。


将来时:
Further research will likely refine our understanding of Ganoidei. = 进一步的研究可能会改进我们对硬鳞鱼类的理解。
Scientists will continue to study the evolutionary relationships of Ganoidei. = 科学家们将继续研究硬鳞鱼类的进化关系。


虚拟语气:
If Ganoidei were more diverse today, the ecosystem would be very different. = 如果硬鳞鱼类今天更加多样化，生态系统将会大相径庭。
It is unlikely that Ganoidei would have survived without adapting to environmental changes. = 硬鳞鱼类如果没有适应环境变化，是不可能生存下来的。


被动语态:
Ganoidei are often studied for their unique scales. = 硬鳞鱼类经常因为其独特的鳞片而被研究。
The evolutionary history of Ganoidei is being actively researched. = 硬鳞鱼类的进化史正在积极地被研究。


疑问句:
What are the defining characteristics of Ganoidei? = 硬鳞鱼类的决定性特征是什么？
How many extant species of Ganoidei are there? = 现存的硬鳞鱼类有多少种？


否定句:
Ganoidei are not a monophyletic group. = 硬鳞鱼类不是一个单系群。
Not all fish with ganoid scales belong to the Ganoidei order. = 并非所有具有硬鳞的鱼都属于硬鳞鱼目。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "Ganoidei" as it is a scientific term.  Phrases would be specific to scientific contexts within ichthyology.  Examples might include:

* "Ganoidei phylogeny": 硬鳞鱼类系统发育
* "Ganoidei fossil record": 硬鳞鱼类化石记录
* "Ganoidei evolutionary history": 硬鳞鱼类进化史
* "Extinct Ganoidei": 已灭绝的硬鳞鱼类
* "Classification of Ganoidei": 硬鳞鱼类的分类
