词源:
The word "hamstring" originates from the noun "hamstring," referring to the tendons at the back of the knee.  Historically, hamstringing involved cutting these tendons to disable a person or animal, effectively crippling their ability to walk or run.  The verb "to hamstring" evolved from this literal meaning to describe the figurative act of severely hindering or crippling something else.
