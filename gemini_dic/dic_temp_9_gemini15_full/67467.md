词源:
The word "extolments" is derived from the verb "extol," which comes from the Middle English word "extollen," ultimately from the Old French "extoller," and further back to the Latin "extollere," meaning "to raise up," "to lift up," or "to praise highly."  The suffix "-ment" forms a noun meaning "the action or process of."  Therefore, "extolments" signifies the acts or instances of praising highly.
