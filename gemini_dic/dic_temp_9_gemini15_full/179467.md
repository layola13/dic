The word "redusting" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need to consider possibilities:

**Possibility 1: Misspelling**

It might be a misspelling of one of the following:

* **Redusing:** (This is a less likely misspelling, but possible given the unusual nature of the original word). This would likely also mean "reducing".
