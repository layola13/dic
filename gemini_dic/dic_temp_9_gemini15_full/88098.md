词源:

The verb "hightail" is a relatively recent addition to the English language, originating in American English in the early to mid-20th century.  It's an example of a phrasal verb created by combining existing words to create a vivid and informal meaning.  The "high" likely suggests speed and elevation (as in "high-tailing it"), while "tail" refers to the rear end of an animal, suggesting a swift departure with the rear end leading the way.  The exact etymology is uncertain, but its informal nature suggests its evolution through colloquial speech.
