词源：The term comes from the verb "mock up," which means to create a model or imitation.  "Mock" here derives from Old French *mocquer, meaning "to scoff" or "to deride," but in this context, it implies creating a representation rather than ridicule. "Up" is an adverb intensifying the action of creating.
