levogyrate:/ˈlɛvoʊdʒaɪreɪt/ | adj. | 左旋的；左旋光的 | Rotating to the left; said of a substance that rotates the plane of polarized light to the left.  | Example: The solution exhibited a levogyrate rotation of the polarized light.  该溶液表现出对偏振光的左旋旋转。 |近义词：laevorotatory | 反义词：dextrorotatory


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The solution is levogyrate. = 该溶液是左旋的。
This molecule rotates levogyrate. = 这个分子左旋旋转。


一般过去时:
The compound was levogyrate. = 该化合物是左旋的。
The chemist observed that the sample was levogyrate. = 化学家观察到样品是左旋的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered many levogyrate compounds. = 科学家们已经发现了许多左旋化合物。
The experiment has shown the solution to be levogyrate. = 实验表明该溶液是左旋的。


过去完成时:
Researchers had already identified the substance as levogyrate before the experiment. = 在实验之前，研究人员已经将该物质鉴定为左旋的。
They had found that the compound was levogyrate in previous studies. = 他们在之前的研究中发现该化合物是左旋的。


将来时:
The new drug will likely be levogyrate. = 新药很可能左旋。
We expect the synthesized molecule to be levogyrate. = 我们预计合成的分子将是左旋的。


虚拟语气:
If the compound were levogyrate, it would have different properties. = 如果该化合物是左旋的，它将具有不同的特性。
I wish I had known that the solution was levogyrate beforehand. = 我真希望我事先知道该溶液是左旋的。


被动语态:
The rotation of the light was observed to be levogyrate. = 观察到光的旋转是左旋的。

疑问句:
Is the substance levogyrate or dextrorotatory? = 该物质是左旋的还是右旋的？
Is the rotation of the polarized light levogyrate? = 偏振光的旋转是左旋的吗？


否定句:
The molecule is not levogyrate; it's dextrorotatory. = 该分子不是左旋的；它是右旋的。
The results did not indicate a levogyrate rotation. = 结果没有表明左旋旋转。


PHRASE->
levogyrate rotation = 左旋旋转
levogyrate isomer = 左旋异构体
levogyrate compound = 左旋化合物
levogyrate substance = 左旋物质
specifically levogyrate = 特定左旋


词源:
From Latin *laevus ("left") + Greek -gyros ("turning").  The word reflects the historical observation that certain substances rotate plane-polarized light to the left.
