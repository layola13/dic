词源:
The word "pimple" is of uncertain origin, but it likely arose from a combination of the Old French word "pompe" (meaning "a swelling") and the suffix "-le," which often indicated a diminutive form.  The evolution of the word may have passed through forms akin to "pompelle."  Therefore, its etymology is linked to the visual appearance of the raised skin blemish.
