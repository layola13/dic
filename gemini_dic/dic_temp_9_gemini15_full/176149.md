This request is impossible to fulfill as "rbg" is not a single word with a standard definition, etymology, and usage in the English language.  It could be an abbreviation or initialism, with various meanings depending on context.  Examples:

* **RGB (in the context of color):**  This is the most common meaning.  It refers to the Red, Green, Blue color model.  It's not a single word, but an acronym.  I cannot provide a full analysis following your requested format for something that is not a word, but an acronym.

* **Other potential meanings:**  "rbg" could also represent other things depending on the context, such as initials of a person's name or a code.  Without context, there's no way to determine its meaning.

To provide the requested analysis, I need a specific word or a clear context for the abbreviation "rbg."
