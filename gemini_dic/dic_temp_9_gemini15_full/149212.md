oxyhaemoglobin:/ˌɒksɪˈhiːməʊɡləʊbɪn/ (BrE) /ˌɑːksiˈhiːməʊɡloʊbɪn/ (AmE)| n. |氧合血红蛋白|Oxygenated hemoglobin; the compound formed when hemoglobin binds to oxygen in the lungs.  It is bright red in color and carries oxygen throughout the body. |The bright red color of arterial blood is due to the presence of oxyhaemoglobin.|近义词: oxygenated hemoglobin |反义词: deoxyhaemoglobin

词源:
The word "oxyhaemoglobin" is a compound word formed from:

* **oxy-**:  from Greek "oxys" meaning "sharp," "acid," or "pointed," referring here to oxygen's reactive nature.
* **haemoglobin**: from "haem" (blood) and "globin" (a protein), referring to the protein that carries oxygen in the blood.
