词源:  From Late Latin *catalepsis, from Greek katalēpsis "seizure, grasp," from katalambanein "to seize, grasp," from kata- "down" + lambanein "to take."  The original Greek sense was more of a "seizing" or "grasping" of the mind or body, rather than the specific medical condition as understood today.
