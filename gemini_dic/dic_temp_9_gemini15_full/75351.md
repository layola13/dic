The word "froterer" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure field.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage explanation cannot be provided.  To help, I need more context about where you encountered this word.  Was it in a book, article, conversation, or somewhere else? Knowing the source might help determine its intended meaning.
