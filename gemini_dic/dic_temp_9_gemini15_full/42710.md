The word "countertrippant" is a relatively rare word, formed by combining elements with roots in Old French and Middle English.  It seems constructed on analogy with words like "trippant", which itself is archaic, and suggests a leaping or dancing action. The prefix "counter-" adds the sense of opposition or counteraction.  A full etymological breakdown requires deeper historical linguistic research, as its precise origins and evolution need further investigation in specialized linguistic resources.  The word’s usage is so limited that a detailed grammatical analysis across different tenses, voices, or moods is not practically meaningful.  It would be treated grammatically like any other adjective.
