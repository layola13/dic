词源:  The word "depersonalization" is derived from the prefix "de-", meaning "to remove or reverse," the word "personal," meaning "relating to a person or their individuality," and the suffix "-ization," indicating "the process of making or becoming something."  Therefore, depersonalization literally means "the process of removing or reversing the personal aspect of something or someone."
