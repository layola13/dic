glaucodot:/ˌɡlɔːkəˈdɒt/| n. |辉铜矿|A mineral consisting of copper sulfide, Cu₂S. It is an important ore of copper.  Glaucodot is a relatively rare mineral, typically found in hydrothermal veins associated with other sulfide minerals.  It's characterized by its metallic luster and grayish-white to steel-gray color.|例句：The geologist identified the sample as glaucodot, a significant copper ore.|近义词：covellite, chalcocite|反义词：无

一般现在时:
Glaucodot is a copper sulfide mineral. = 辉铜矿是一种硫化铜矿物。
Glaucodot occurs in hydrothermal veins. = 辉铜矿产于热液脉中。


一般过去时:
Geologists found glaucodot in the mine. = 地质学家在矿井中发现了辉铜矿。
They analyzed the glaucodot sample. = 他们分析了辉铜矿样本。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several glaucodot deposits. = 科学家已经发现了几个辉铜矿矿床。
We have studied the crystal structure of glaucodot. = 我们已经研究了辉铜矿的晶体结构。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, they had prepared the glaucodot sample. = 在分析之前，他们已经准备好了辉铜矿样本。
The researchers had never seen such a large glaucodot crystal. = 研究人员以前从未见过这么大的辉铜矿晶体。


将来时:
We will analyze the glaucodot sample next week. = 我们下周将分析辉铜矿样本。
They will publish their findings on glaucodot soon. = 他们很快就会发表他们关于辉铜矿的研究结果。
