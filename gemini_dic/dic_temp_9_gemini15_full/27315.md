词源:
The verb "calypsoed" is derived from the noun "calypso," which refers to a style of West Indian music and song, originating in Trinidad and Tobago.  The word's etymology is uncertain, but it may be related to the Greek word "kalypso," meaning "to conceal" or "to cover," possibly referring to the hidden meanings or social commentary often found within calypso lyrics.  The verb form simply indicates the action of performing or singing in this style.
