用法说明:

foetor is almost exclusively used as a noun. It is not commonly used in everyday conversation, appearing more frequently in literature or descriptions requiring a strong, evocative word for a particularly unpleasant smell.  It implies a more intense and pervasive smell than simply "stink" or "reek".
