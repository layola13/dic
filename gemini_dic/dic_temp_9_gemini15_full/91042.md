词源:
The adjective "husky" ultimately derives from the Old Norse word *hǫsku, meaning "hoarse" or "rough". This word found its way into Middle English as "hosk," which also meant "hoarse."  The modern spelling "husky" and the shift in meaning to include the dog breed developed later. The association with the dog breed likely stems from the dogs' characteristic thick, coarse coats and the often harsh conditions they endure.
