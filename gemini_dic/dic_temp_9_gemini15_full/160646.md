英文解析：Portentousness refers to the quality of being portentous.  Something portentous is of such significance that it suggests something momentous is about to happen; it often implies an overly serious or solemn manner. It can also suggest an excessive display of importance or seriousness, often to the point of being pompous or pretentious.

例句：

The dark clouds and eerie silence added to the portentousness of the situation.  乌云密布和令人毛骨悚然的寂静加剧了局势的险恶。


His portentous speech, filled with long words and dramatic pauses, bored the audience. 他那冗长乏味的演讲，充满了长篇大论和戏剧性的停顿，让听众感到厌烦。


词源：

The word derives from the adjective "portentous," which comes from the Latin word "portentum," meaning "omen" or "prodigious sign."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the quality or state of being portentous.


用法说明：

Portentousness is typically used to describe:

*   **Events or situations:**  A portentous atmosphere, a portentous event, a portentous silence.
*   **Speech or writing:** A portentous tone, a portentous style, a portentous announcement.
*   **People:** A portentous manner, a portentous individual (someone who acts overly serious or important).

The word often carries a negative connotation, suggesting an artificial or exaggerated seriousness.  While it can describe something genuinely ominous, it more often implies pomposity or pretentiousness.
