词源:

The word "reenjoined" is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the verb "enjoin."  "Enjoin" ultimately derives from the Old French word "enjoindre," which itself comes from the Latin "injungere," meaning "to join in," "to order," or "to command."  Therefore, "reenjoined" literally means "to join in again" or "to order again."
