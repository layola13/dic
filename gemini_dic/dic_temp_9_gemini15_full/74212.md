WORD ORIGIN->

The word "fourteenth" is derived from the Old English "fēowerteogoða," which combines "fēower" (four) and "teogoða" (tenth).  The "-teenth" suffix indicates the ordinal position beyond ten.  The modern English form evolved through Middle English and reflects the consistent pattern of ordinal number formation in the language.
