词源:
conservation comes from the Latin word *conservare*, meaning "to keep," "to preserve," or "to protect."  The prefix "con-" means "together," and the root "-servāre" is related to the verb "servare," meaning "to save" or "to keep safe."  Therefore, the word's core meaning reflects the act of keeping something safe or preserving it.
