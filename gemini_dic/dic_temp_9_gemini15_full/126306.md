It is similar to myoglobin but differs in its spectroscopic properties and amino acid sequence.  It functions as an oxygen storage protein, enabling these animals to survive periods of hypoxia (low oxygen levels).|Example: The presence of myohaematin in the muscles of this deep-sea fish allows it to survive long dives without resurfacing.|近义词：myoglobin (partially)|反义词：无|名词
