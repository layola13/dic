The word "preaccording" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries or corpora.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word not yet recognized.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need a valid English word.
