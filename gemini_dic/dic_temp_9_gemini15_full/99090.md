interbreeding:/ˌɪntərˈbriːdɪŋ/ | n. |近亲繁殖，杂交|The act or process of breeding individuals of closely related lineages, often resulting in offspring with increased homozygosity and a higher likelihood of expressing recessive traits.  Interbreeding can also refer to the breeding of individuals from different populations or subspecies. |例句：The consequences of interbreeding in small, isolated populations can be detrimental. 近亲繁殖对小型隔离种群的影响可能是毁灭性的。  The study examined the effects of interbreeding between different breeds of dogs. 这项研究调查了不同犬种之间杂交的影响。|近义词：hybridization, crossbreeding |反义词：inbreeding avoidance, outbreeding
