The word "mcdow" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (like a surname), a slang term, or a word from a niche vocabulary.  More context is needed to understand its meaning.
