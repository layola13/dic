decerniture:/dəˈsɜːrnɪtʃər/| n.|  判决；裁决；决定 |  The word "decerniture" is extremely rare and not found in standard dictionaries. It seems to be a less common or archaic variant, possibly a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word) based on the Latin roots "decernere" (to decide, determine) and potentially a suffix suggesting the result of that decision.  It would likely function similarly to words like "decree," "judgment," or "verdict."  There is no readily available example sentence or usage information due to the word's obscurity. |近义词：decree, judgment, verdict, ruling |反义词：indecision, uncertainty
