近义词：lethargically, languidly, listlessly, carelessly, indifferently


反义词：energetically, enthusiastically, diligently, zealously


词源:  The word originates from the phrase "lack-a-daisy," which was a 17th-century expression of indifference or listlessness.  "Lack" implies a deficiency, and "a-daisy" is thought to be a corruption of "a day's eye," referring to a lazy, unfocused state, similar to the way one might gaze at a flower. The "-ical" suffix transforms it into an adverb.
