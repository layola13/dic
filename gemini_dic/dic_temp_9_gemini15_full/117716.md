词源:  The word "melancholiness" derives from the Old French "melancolie," which itself comes from the Late Latin "melancholia."  This term is a combination of the Greek words "melas" (μέλας), meaning "black," and "chole" (χολή), meaning "bile."  Ancient Greek humoral theory associated melancholia with an excess of black bile, believed to be one of the four bodily humors influencing temperament.  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix forming nouns of state or quality.
