reradiation:/ˌriːreɪdieɪʃən/| n. |再辐射，二次辐射 |The emission of radiation previously absorbed.|  The Earth reradiates some of the sun's energy back into space. 地球将部分太阳能再辐射回太空。|近义词：re-emission, secondary radiation |反义词：initial radiation


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The Earth reradiates heat into space. = 地球将热量再辐射到太空。
Reradiation of energy occurs constantly. = 能量的再辐射不断发生。


一般过去时:
The building reradiated the heat throughout the night. = 这栋建筑整夜都在再辐射热量。
The experiment showed that the material reradiated a significant amount of energy. = 实验表明，该材料再辐射了大量的能量。


现在完成时:
