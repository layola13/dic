词源:
The word "honeymoon" itself is of uncertain origin, but the most accepted theory links it to the old custom of drinking honey mead for a month after the wedding.  The "-mooned" suffix suggests a period of time, much like "sun-mooned" might refer to a month dedicated to the sun (though this is not a real word).  The verb "honeymooned" is a relatively modern back-formation from the noun "honeymoon".
