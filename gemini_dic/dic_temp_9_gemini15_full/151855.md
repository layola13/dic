词源:passionately derives from the word "passion," which comes from the Old French word "passion," ultimately from the Latin word "passio," meaning "suffering," "feeling," or "endurance."  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass strong emotions, especially love or anger. The "-ately" suffix is an adverbial ending indicating manner.
