PHRASE->
While "quartziferous" doesn't readily form common multi-word phrases in the same way as words like "what," it frequently appears in geological descriptions.  Therefore, instead of phrases, we provide example contexts:

"quartziferous conglomerate": 含石英砾岩
"quartziferous veins": 含石英脉
"quartziferous sandstone": 含石英砂岩
"highly quartziferous": 高石英含量
"moderately quartziferous": 中等石英含量


WORD ORIGIN->

The word "quartziferous" is derived from:

* **quartz:** From German *Quarz*, ultimately from Slavic (e.g., Polish *kwarc*).  This refers to the mineral itself.
* **-iferous:**  A suffix meaning "bearing," "producing," or "containing."  It's of Latin origin, derived from *ferre* (to bear, carry).


Therefore, "quartziferous" literally means "quartz-bearing."
