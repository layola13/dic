quasi-zealously: /ˈkwɑːzaɪˈziləslɪ/ | adj. | 近乎狂热地，类似狂热地 |


英文解析:The word "quasi-zealously" combines "quasi" (meaning seemingly, apparently, or to a certain extent) with "zealously" (meaning with great energy and enthusiasm).  Therefore, it describes an action or behavior that shows a degree of fervent enthusiasm, but perhaps not completely or genuinely zealous.  It implies a less intense or slightly less sincere form of zeal.


例句:

He quasi-zealously defended his unpopular opinion, more out of stubbornness than true conviction. = 他近乎狂热地捍卫着他不受欢迎的观点，更多的是出于固执而不是真正的信念。


She quasi-zealously collected stamps, occasionally losing interest for periods of time. = 她近乎狂热地收集邮票，偶尔也会失去兴趣一段时间。


近义词:  passionately (but less intensely), fervently (but with some reservation), enthusiastically (but not fully committed), ardently (but with a hint of pretense).
