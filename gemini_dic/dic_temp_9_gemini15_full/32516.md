词源:

The word "chintz" entered English in the 17th century, ultimately deriving from the Hindi word "chhint," meaning "spotted or variegated."  It reflects the brightly colored and patterned nature of the fabric.  The word’s journey involved passing through Persian (chint) and possibly Portuguese before reaching English.
