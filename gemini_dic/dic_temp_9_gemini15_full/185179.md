词源:
The word "retort" ultimately comes from the Old French word "retorter," meaning "to twist back," or "to return."  This reflects the sense of turning an argument or statement back on its originator. The verb's evolution shows a clear link to the earlier meaning of the noun "retort," a kind of chemical vessel used in distillation—the shape suggesting a turning back.
