词源:  The word "crossing" comes from the Old English word "crossian," meaning "to make the sign of the cross," which in turn originates from the Latin word "crux," meaning "cross."  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the act of crossing a physical space or boundary.  The noun form naturally followed.
