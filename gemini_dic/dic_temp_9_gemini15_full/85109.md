hardenable: /ˈhɑːrdənəbl/ | adj. | 可硬化的，可淬火的 | Capable of being hardened, especially by heat treatment.  This typically refers to materials that can increase their hardness through processes like heat treating or cold working. |

例句：

This steel alloy is hardenable, allowing for increased durability.  = 这种钢合金是可硬化的，可以提高耐用性。

The manufacturer specifies that the component is made from a hardenable material. = 制造商规定该部件是由可硬化材料制成的。


近义词：hardening, temperable, case-hardening (depending on context)

反义词：unhardenable, soft

词源:

The word "hardenable" is derived from the verb "harden" + the suffix "-able," indicating capability or possibility.  "Harden" itself has roots in Old English "heard" meaning hard, strong, and the suffix "-ian" indicating to make or become.


USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective, so tense does not apply directly.  However, it can be used in various sentence structures.

一般现在时:
The metal is hardenable. = 这种金属是可硬化的。
This material is hardenable by heat treatment. = 这种材料可以通过热处理硬化。

一般过去时:
The component was hardenable. = 该部件是可硬化的。
The steel was hardenable before the treatment. = 钢在处理前是可硬化的。

现在完成时:
The parts have been proven hardenable. = 零件已被证明是可硬化的。
The engineers have found the alloy to be hardenable. = 工程师们发现这种合金是可硬化的。


过去完成时:
The manufacturer had specified that the material should be hardenable. = 制造商已规定材料应可硬化。
They had known that the material was hardenable. = 他们知道这种材料是可硬化的。


将来时:
The new alloy will be hardenable. = 新合金将是可硬化的。

被动语态:
The steel can be hardened. = 钢可以被硬化。（This is closely related, showing the result of being hardenable）
The metal is being tested for hardenability. = 正在测试金属的可硬化性。


疑问句:
Is this material hardenable? = 这种材料可硬化吗？
Are these tools made from hardenable steel? = 这些工具是由可硬化钢制成的吗？


否定句:
The plastic is not hardenable. = 这种塑料不可硬化。
That alloy is not easily hardenable. = 那种合金不容易硬化。
