USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "What" which is a pronoun and can function as a question word and noun.  Therefore, tense analysis, passive voice, etc. are not applicable to the word "mistitles" itself.  You would use verb conjugations to describe the *action* of mistitling something.  For example:

一般现在时:
He mistitles his artwork frequently. 他经常给他的艺术作品起错标题。
