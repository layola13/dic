词源:
The word "quasi-fatal" is a combination of "quasi" and "fatal".  "Quasi" is from Latin, meaning "as if," "apparently," or "seemingly." "Fatal" comes from Latin "fatalis," meaning "fateful" or "deadly."  Therefore, quasi-fatal describes something that resembles or has the characteristics of being fatal, but may not quite reach that level.
