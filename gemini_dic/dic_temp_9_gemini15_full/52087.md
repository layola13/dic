diamagnetism:/ˌdaɪəˈmæɡnɪtɪzəm/| n. |抗磁性|The property of a substance to repel a magnetic field.  Diamagnetic materials have a permeability slightly less than that of a vacuum and are weakly repelled by a magnetic field.|Example:  Bismuth exhibits strong diamagnetism.|近义词：magnetic repulsion|反义词：paramagnetism, ferromagnetism

USAGE->
