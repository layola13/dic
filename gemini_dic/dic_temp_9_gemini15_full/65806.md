/ˌɛvɪdɛnʃiˈæləti/ | n. | 陈述性,  证据性 | The grammatical category that indicates the source of information expressed in an utterance.  It refers to how the speaker knows the information being conveyed, whether it is based on direct observation, inference, hearsay, or some other source. Evidentiality is often marked grammatically in languages, indicating the speaker's degree of certainty or the source of their knowledge. |  The sentence "It's raining" can have different evidential meanings depending on the context. If the speaker is looking out the window, it's a direct observation. If the speaker heard it on the radio, it's reported information. | 近义词：source attribution, epistemological marking | 反义词：N/A


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in linguistics and related fields, not in general conversation.  Therefore, providing examples across various tenses and moods is not applicable in the same way as for a common verb or noun.  Instead, examples will illustrate the concept in different linguistic contexts.

Example 1 (Direct Evidence):
"I *saw* him leave." = 我亲眼看见他离开了。(The verb "saw" indicates direct observation.)


Example 2 (Inference):
"He *must* be tired." = 他一定累了。(The modal verb "must" suggests an inference based on evidence.)


Example 3 (Reported Evidence):
"They *said* it was going to snow." = 他们说要下雪了。(The verb "said" shows the information is hearsay.)


Example 4 (Lack of Evidence):
"It *seems* like it might rain." = 好像要下雨了。(The verb "seems" expresses uncertainty and a lack of direct evidence.)



Example 5 (Linguistic Marking):
In some languages, evidentiality is marked through grammatical morphemes.  For example, in Turkish, different suffixes can be added to verbs to indicate whether the speaker witnessed an event, heard about it, or inferred it.  This is a complex grammatical feature that varies greatly across languages.
