intercolonizing: /ˌɪntərˈkɑːlənaɪzɪŋ/ | v. | 互相殖民；相互入侵 | The act of multiple groups or entities colonizing each other, often implying a complex and reciprocal relationship of power and influence, rather than a unidirectional process. This term often emerges in discussions of postcolonial theory, cultural studies, and critical geography, moving beyond the traditional understanding of colonialism as a singular, dominant power exerting control over a subjugated population.  | Example:  The study explores the intercolonizing relationship between the two cultures, showing how each influenced and shaped the other's development.  = 这项研究探讨了两种文化之间的相互殖民关系，展示了每种文化如何影响和塑造了对方的發展。
