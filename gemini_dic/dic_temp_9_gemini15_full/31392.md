词源:

The word "chargeableness" is derived from the verb "charge," which has a long and complex history.  In its broadest sense, "charge" means to impose a burden or responsibility. This meaning has roots in the Old French word "charger," meaning "to load, burden."  The modern English word "charge" encompasses various meanings, including:

* To demand payment:  This sense is related to the idea of loading someone with a financial burden.
* To accuse formally:  This relates to loading someone with the burden of a crime or wrongdoing.
* To fill or load (with electricity): This is a more modern extension of the original sense of loading or burdening.

The suffix "-able" means "capable of being," and "-ness" creates a noun denoting a state or quality.  Therefore, "chargeableness" combines these elements to mean the quality of being capable of being charged (financially or legally) or the state of being attributable to something.
