词源:
The word "moralities" is the plural form of "morality," which comes from the Old French word "moralité," meaning "moral character, moral conduct."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "moralitas," sharing the same meaning and ultimately stemming from the Latin word "mores," meaning "customs, manners."  Thus, the word's roots lie in the concept of societal customs and behavior that are considered right or wrong.
