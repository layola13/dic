The word "crare" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no pronunciation, definition, etymology, or usage to provide.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a very rare or archaic word:**  If you encountered it in a specific context (a book, a document), please provide that context for further investigation.
* **It's a proper noun or a word from a specific dialect or field:**  Again, more context is needed.
* **It's a newly coined word:**  If it's a newly coined word, there would be no established information about it yet.
