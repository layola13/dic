词源:  The word "cocky"  originated in the early 20th century (1920s) as American slang.  Its etymology is uncertain, but it's likely derived from a combination of "cock" (a term for a rooster, often associated with aggression and strutting behavior) and a diminutive suffix "-y," suggesting a smaller, less threatening but still arrogant version.
