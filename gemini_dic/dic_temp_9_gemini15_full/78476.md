g-force:/dʒiːˈfɔːrs/|/ˈdʒiːfɔːrs/| n.|G力，重力加速度|The force of gravity, typically expressed as a multiple of the earth's gravitational force.  It is often used to describe the acceleration experienced by pilots or astronauts.|The fighter pilot experienced a high g-force during the sharp turn.|近义词：gravitational force, acceleration|反义词：weightlessness


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The pilot feels a high g-force during takeoff. = 飞行员在起飞时会感受到高G力。
The roller coaster exerts a significant g-force on riders. = 过山车对乘客施加了很大的G力。


一般过去时:
The astronaut experienced 5g during the launch. = 宇航员在发射时经历了5G的加速度。
The car crash resulted in a sudden, high g-force impact. = 车祸导致了突然的、高G力的撞击。


现在完成时:
They have endured high g-forces throughout their flight training. = 在他们的飞行训练中，他们已经承受了高G力。
Astronauts have experienced extreme g-forces during space missions. = 宇航员在太空任务中经历了极端的G力。


过去完成时:
Before the maneuver, the pilot had never experienced such a high g-force. = 在这次机动之前，飞行员从未经历过如此高的G力。
The test subject had already endured several high-g tests before this one. = 在这次测试之前，受试者已经经历了几次高G测试。


将来时:
The centrifuge will produce a high g-force during the experiment. = 离心机将在实验中产生高G力。
The next generation of fighter jets will likely expose pilots to even higher g-forces. = 下一代战斗机可能会使飞行员承受更高的G力。


虚拟语气:
If the g-force were higher, the experiment might fail. = 如果G力更高，实验可能会失败。
I wish the g-force on this roller coaster were lower. = 我希望这个过山车的G力更低一些。


被动语态:
The spacecraft was subjected to a high g-force during re-entry. = 宇宙飞船在重返大气层时承受了高G力。
The test subject is being exposed to gradually increasing g-forces. = 受试者正在承受逐渐增大的G力。


疑问句:
What g-force did the astronaut experience during the spacewalk? = 宇航员在太空行走期间经历了多少G力？
What is the maximum g-force that a human can withstand? = 人类能够承受的最大G力是多少？


否定句:
The spaceship did not experience a significant g-force during its journey. = 宇宙飞船在其旅程中没有经历明显的G力。
The ride did not produce the high g-force that was advertised. = 该游乐设施没有产生广告中宣传的高G力。


PHRASE->
high g-force = 高G力
sustained g-force = 持续的G力
peak g-force = 峰值G力
withstand g-force = 承受G力
experience g-force = 经历G力
