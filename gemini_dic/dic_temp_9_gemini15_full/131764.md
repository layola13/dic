nonconjugality:/ˌnɒnkɒnˈdʒuːɡælɪti/ | n. |非共轭性，非结合性 | The state or quality of not being conjugate; lack of conjugation.  It often refers to the absence of a relationship between two things that are expected to be related in some way, particularly in mathematical or genetic contexts. For example, in genetics, nonconjugality might refer to the inability of two chromosomes to pair during meiosis. | Example: The study revealed a high degree of nonconjugality among the bacterial strains. 这项研究揭示了细菌菌株之间高度的非共轭性。|近义词:disjunction, non-association |反义词:conjugation, association |名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in specialized fields like genetics and mathematics, and doesn't have common verb conjugations as a regular word.  Therefore, standard tense examples aren't applicable.  Instead, we can show how it's used in sentences demonstrating different grammatical functions:

Declarative Sentence:
The researchers observed significant nonconjugality in the experimental group. 研究人员在实验组中观察到显著的非共轭性。


Interrogative Sentence:
Is the high degree of nonconjugality a result of the mutation? 高度的非共轭性是突变的结果吗？


Negative Sentence:
The absence of nonconjugality suggests a strong genetic linkage. 非共轭性的缺失表明存在强烈的遗传联系。


Complex Sentence:
Because of the nonconjugality observed, further investigation is needed to understand the underlying mechanism. 由于观察到的非共轭性，需要进一步研究以了解其潜在机制。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "nonconjugality" due to its specialized usage.  Phrases would be context-specific within the scientific fields where it is used. For instance, one might see phrases like: "degree of nonconjugality," "evidence of nonconjugality," "analysis of nonconjugality," "causes of nonconjugality," or "impact of nonconjugality."
