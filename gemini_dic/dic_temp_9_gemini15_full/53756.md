词源:
The word "discomfiter" comes from the verb "discomfort," which itself is derived from the Old French "desconforter," meaning "to discourage" or "to dishearten."  The prefix "dis-" indicates negation or reversal, while "comfort" has its roots in the Latin "confortare," meaning "to strengthen."  Thus, "discomfiter" ultimately signifies something that weakens or undermines comfort and ease.
