词源:

The phrase is a combination of "holier" (comparative of "holy," meaning sacred or morally pure) and "than thou," a contraction of "than thee," an older form of "than you."  The phrase implies a comparison where the speaker believes themselves to be holier than the person they are addressing.  The construction is an example of a comparative clause with an implied subject.
