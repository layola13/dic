词源:
The word "interact" is a combination of the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and the verb "act" (meaning "to do something").  Therefore, it literally means "to act between or among." The word emerged in the early 20th century, reflecting the growing interest in the interplay of different elements in various fields.
