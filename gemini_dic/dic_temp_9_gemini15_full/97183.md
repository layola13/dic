/ˌɪnfɪkˈseɪʃənz/ | n. | 词缀插入法；内插法 | The process of inserting an affix within a word stem, rather than at the beginning (prefixation) or end (suffixation).  This is a relatively rare morphological process. | Example:  The word "unbreakable" demonstrates affixation (prefix "un-", suffix "-able"), while a hypothetical example of infixation might be inserting "-umph-" into "pleasant" to create "ple-umph-asant" (though this is not a real word). | 近义词：intercalation, insertion (in a broader sense) | 反义词：prefixation, suffixation

USAGE->
This word is primarily used in linguistics and morphology discussions; it doesn't have common usage in everyday conversation.  Therefore, providing example sentences across various grammatical tenses is not practical.  Instead, we'll focus on how the concept is discussed.


Example 1 (Linguistic Analysis):
"Infixation is a less common type of morphological process compared to prefixation and suffixation." = 词缀插入法相较于前缀法和后缀法而言是一种不太常见的形态构成过程。


Example 2 (Comparative Morphology):
"The paper compares infixation in Tagalog with reduplication in Indonesian." = 这篇论文比较了塔加禄语中的词缀插入法和印尼语中的重叠法。



PHRASE->
This word itself is not commonly used in phrases. Phrases utilizing the concept would be found within linguistic contexts.  For example:  "Examples of infixation are rare in English," or "The study explored the rules governing infixation in this language."
