词源:
The word "cataleptically" is derived from the noun "catalepsy," which comes from the Late Latin word *catalepsis*, a borrowing from the Greek word καταληψις (*catalēpsis*).  *Catalēpsis* is a compound word formed from κατά (*kata*), meaning "down," "according to," or "completely," and λῆψις (*lēpsis*), meaning "seizure" or "taking."  Therefore, the original meaning hinted at a "seizure" or a "complete taking over" of the body, referring to the symptoms of the condition.


用法说明:
Cataleptically is an adverb describing an action or state characterized by catalepsy.  Catalepsy is a neurological condition characterized by a trance-like state with muscular rigidity and waxy flexibility, where limbs retain any position they are placed in.  The adverb indicates that something is happening in a way that resembles this condition, often implying stillness, immobility, or a lack of responsiveness.  It's generally used in a medical or descriptive context.
