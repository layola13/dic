preobviousnesses: /ˌpriːˈɒbviəsnəsɪz/ | n. | 预先显而易见的事物；显而易见的事物（复数） |  This word is a neologism, meaning it's a newly coined word not yet widely accepted or found in standard dictionaries. It's formed by adding the prefix "pre-" (meaning before or beforehand) to the plural of "obviousness" (the state of being obvious).  It suggests things that are obvious even before they happen or are explicitly stated.  There is no standard definition, usage or synonyms/antonyms readily available because it is not a formally recognized word.  The meaning is derived from its constituent parts. |  例句：The preobviousnesses of the situation were ignored, leading to disastrous consequences. (情形的预先显而易见之处被忽视了，导致了灾难性的后果。)  The meeting was a series of preobviousnesses, nothing surprising was discussed. (会议上是一连串显而易见的事情，没有什么令人惊讶的讨论。) | 近义词: (No established near synonyms due to the neologism status.
