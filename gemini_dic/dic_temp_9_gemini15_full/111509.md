词源:
The word "loamy" derives from the Middle English word "lom," meaning "clay," "mud," or "soil."  This, in turn, is believed to have Germanic origins, possibly related to Old High German "leimo" or Old English "lim," both meaning "glue" or "sticky substance." The association stems from the cohesive nature of loam, which holds its shape well. The "-y" suffix is an adjectival suffix, meaning "full of" or "characterized by."


用法说明:
Loamy is primarily used as an adjective to describe soil or land.  It's often used in agricultural, horticultural, and environmental contexts.  The word connotes richness and fertility, implying suitability for plant growth. It doesn't typically have other grammatical uses beyond its adjectival function.  There is no verb form "to loamy."
