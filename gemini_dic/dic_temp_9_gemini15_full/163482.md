词源:

The word "precontrolling" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and "controlling" (referring to the act of exercising control).  The suffix "-ing" indicates its adjectival function, describing something as being characterized by preemptive control.  The root "control" has origins in Old French "controille" and ultimately from Latin "contrarotulare" (to counter-roll, to check).
