confounder:/kənˈfaʊndər/ | n. | 混杂因素，混淆因素 | A variable that influences both the dependent and independent variables, thereby distorting the association between them.  It makes it difficult to determine the true relationship between the independent and dependent variables because its effects are mixed with those of the independent variable. | Example: In a study examining the relationship between smoking and lung cancer, age could be a confounder because older people are more likely to have smoked and are also more likely to develop lung cancer.  |近义词： confounding variable, extraneous variable, lurking variable | 反义词：control variable

词源:

The word "confounder" originates from the verb "confound," meaning to confuse or bewilder.  The noun form developed to describe a factor that causes confusion or obscures the true relationship between variables in research.  The root is ultimately from the Old French "confondre,"  itself from the Latin "confundere," meaning "to pour together," "to mix up."
