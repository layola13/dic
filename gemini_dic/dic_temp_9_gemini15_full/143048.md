The word "outblunder" is not a standard dictionary word. It's a newly coined word formed by combining "out-" (meaning to surpass or exceed) and "blunder" (meaning to make a mistake, but here used in a figurative sense to mean a strategic move).  Therefore, there are no established synonyms or antonyms, and standard grammatical tense conjugations follow the verb "blunder".
