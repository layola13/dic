词源:

The word "outsiderishness" is a relatively recent coinage. It's formed by adding the suffix "-ishness" to the noun "outsider."  The suffix "-ishness" creates abstract nouns denoting a quality or state, often implying a somewhat negative or undesirable characteristic.  The root "outsider" itself combines "out" (meaning outside or not within) with "sider" (related to "side," implying a position or group).  Therefore, the word's etymology traces back to basic spatial and social concepts.
