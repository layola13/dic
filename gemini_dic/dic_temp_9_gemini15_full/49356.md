词源:
The word "delinquent" comes from the Latin word "delinquent," meaning "neglecting or leaving undone."  It entered English in the 16th century, initially referring to someone who neglected a duty or obligation.  Its modern usage, referring to a criminal, particularly a young one, developed later.
