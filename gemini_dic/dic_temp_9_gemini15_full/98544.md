词源:
The word "instillator" is derived from the verb "instill," meaning "to introduce gradually or subtly,"  combined with the suffix "-ator," which denotes an agent or instrument.  The root "in-" means "into," "still" is related to the idea of dropping or pouring, leading to the meaning of inserting or introducing a liquid.
