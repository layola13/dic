词源:

* **quasi-**:  from Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," or "seemingly."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation.

* **fatally**: from "fatal," ultimately from Latin *fatalis*, meaning "destined," "fated," or relating to fate.


用法说明：

"Quasi-fatally" is used to describe an event or injury that came very close to causing death, but ultimately did not result in death.  It emphasizes the nearness of the outcome to a fatal one.  It is primarily used in descriptive writing and in informal settings.  It's less common in formal medical or legal contexts where more precise terminology would be preferred.
