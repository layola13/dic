fluohydric:/ˌfluːoʊˈhaɪdrɪk/| adj.|氟氢的；氢氟酸的 | Pertaining to or containing hydrofluoric acid.  It's a less common term, often used in more specialized chemical contexts.  | The fluohydric acid etched the glass.  氢氟酸腐蚀了玻璃。 | hydrofluoric, fluorohydric |  (no direct antonym, but perhaps "non-fluorinated" could be considered a contextual opposite) |形容词
