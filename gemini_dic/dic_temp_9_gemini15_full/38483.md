conchoid:/ˈkɒŋkɔɪd/ | n. |蚌线，蜗线 |A conchoid is a curve defined by a fixed point, a fixed line, and a constant distance.  A point moves along a line such that its distance from the fixed point is always a constant amount more or less than its distance to the fixed line.  Different conchoids result from varying the constant distance and the relative positions of the point and line. The shape resembles a seashell, hence the name. |The conchoid of Nicomedes is a famous example of this curve, used in ancient Greece for solving the problem of angle trisection. |近义词：curve, spiral |反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
