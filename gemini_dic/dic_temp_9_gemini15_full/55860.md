词源:
The word "divining" comes from the Old French word "deviner," meaning "to guess," "to divine," or "to find out."  This, in turn, has roots in the Latin word "divinare," which means "to foresee," "to prophesy," or "to be inspired by a god."  The connection to the divine is strong in the word's etymology, reflecting the historical association of divining with supernatural or religious practices.
