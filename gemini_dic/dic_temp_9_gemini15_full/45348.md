Etymology:

The word "cumulonimbus" is a combination of two Latin roots:

* **cumulus:** meaning "heap" or "pile," referring to the puffy, heaped-up appearance of the cloud base.
* **nimbus:** meaning "rain cloud" or "storm cloud," indicating the cloud's association with precipitation and stormy weather.


Therefore, "cumulonimbus" literally translates to "heaped rain cloud" or "piled storm cloud."  This accurately reflects the cloud's visual characteristics and its association with severe weather.
