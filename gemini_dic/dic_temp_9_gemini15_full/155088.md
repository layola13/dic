词源:
The word "petroglyphic" comes from the combination of two Greek words:

* **petra (πέτρα):** meaning "rock" or "stone"
* **glyphein (γλύφειν):** meaning "to carve" or "to engrave"

Therefore, "petroglyphic" literally means "rock-carved" or "rock-engraved".  The suffix "-ic" denotes an adjective.
