Etymology:

The word "licentiousness" comes from the Middle English word "licentious," which itself derives from the Old French word "licencieux."  This Old French word is composed of "licence" (meaning "license" or "permission") and the suffix "-eux" (meaning "-ous" or indicating a state or quality). Therefore, the original sense implied a state of having or acting with excessive freedom or permission, often leading to moral laxity.  The modern meaning has evolved to strongly emphasize the sexual aspect, but the core concept of unrestrained behavior remains.
