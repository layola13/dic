词源:
The word "delegate" comes from the Latin word "delegatus," the past participle of "delegare," meaning "to send," "to appoint," or "to entrust."  The prefix "de-" means "away" or "off," and "legare" means "to send" or "to appoint."  Therefore, the original meaning points to the act of sending someone away to represent another.
