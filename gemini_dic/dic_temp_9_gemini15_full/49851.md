词源:
demoralizingly is derived from the adjective "demoralizing," which in turn comes from the verb "demoralize."  "Demoralize" is formed from the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to deprive of") and the noun "morale" (referring to the spirit or confidence of a person or group).  Therefore, "demoralize" literally means "to deprive of morale" or "to lower the morale of." The adverbial suffix "-ingly" is added to "demoralizing" to create "demoralizingly," indicating the manner in which something is demoralizing.
