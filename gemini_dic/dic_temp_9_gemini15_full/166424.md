词源:

The word is a combination of "pre-" (meaning before) and "restraint" (meaning control or limitation).  "Restraint" itself comes from the Old French word "restreindre," meaning "to restrain," which further derives from the Latin "restringere," meaning "to bind back."  Therefore, "prerestraint" literally means "a restraint that is applied beforehand."
