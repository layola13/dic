laelaps: /ˈleɪlæps/ | n. | 拉埃拉普斯（神话中的猎犬）| In Greek mythology, Laelaps was a dog said to never fail to catch its prey.  It was given to Cephalus by Zeus or Artemis.  The dog's name itself means "storm" or "hurricane" and reflects its incredible speed and hunting prowess.  Eventually, Laelaps and the Teumessian fox, a creature that could never be caught, were trapped in a paradoxical situation, both destined to catch the other.  Zeus resolved this by turning both into stone. | Example: The myth of Laelaps and the Teumessian fox illustrates the concept of inescapable fate. = 拉埃拉普斯和特耳墨西斯狐的神话阐释了不可逃避的命运这一概念。 | 近义词: hound, dog (in a mythological context) | 反义词: None specifically, as it's a proper noun referring to a specific mythological creature. |  名词
