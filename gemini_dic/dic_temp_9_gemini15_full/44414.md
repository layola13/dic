cross-multiplication:/krɒsˌmʌltɪplɪˈkeɪʃən/| n. |交叉相乘；十字相乘|The process of multiplying the numerator of one fraction by the denominator of another fraction, and vice versa, to solve for an unknown variable or to compare fractions.| Example: In the equation 2/x = 3/5, cross-multiplication gives 2*5 = 3*x, which simplifies to 10 = 3x, and thus x = 10/3. |近义词：cross-products|反义词：无
