词源:
The word "determine" comes from the Old French word "determiner," which means "to limit, bound, fix."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "determinare," meaning "to set limits to, define, decide."  The Latin word is composed of "de-" (meaning "completely") and "terminare" (meaning "to end, bound, limit").  Therefore, the core meaning revolves around setting boundaries and making a decision.
