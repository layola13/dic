词源:

The word "pseudoevangelic" is a compound word.  "Pseudo" is derived from the Greek word ψευδής (pseudēs), meaning "false" or "lying."  "Evangelic" comes from the Greek word εὐαγγέλιον (euangelion), meaning "good news," which in a religious context refers to the Christian gospel.  Therefore, "pseudoevangelic" literally means "false gospel" or "falsely evangelical."
