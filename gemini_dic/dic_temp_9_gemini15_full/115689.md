词源:
The word "marginalise" comes from the adjective "marginal," meaning "situated on the edge or border."  "Marginal" itself originates from the Latin word "marginalis," derived from "margo," meaning "edge" or "border." The "-ise" suffix is a common verb-forming suffix indicating to make or become something.  Therefore, "marginalise" literally means "to make something or someone exist on the margins or edges of society."
