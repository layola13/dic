词源:  Derived from the adjective "conclusive," which comes from the verb "conclude" (to bring to an end; to arrive at a judgment or decision).  The suffix "-ness" is added to form a noun, indicating the state or quality of being conclusive.  The root of "conclude" traces back to the Latin word "concludere," which means "to shut up, enclose, finish."
