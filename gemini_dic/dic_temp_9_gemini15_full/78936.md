词源:
The word "girasol" comes from the Spanish language.  It is a compound word formed from "gira" (turn) and "sol" (sun), literally meaning "turns to the sun," a reference to the heliotropic nature of sunflowers, which track the sun's movement across the sky.  Its use in reference to the gemstone likely derives from the stone's characteristic blue color reminiscent of a clear sky, and possibly its internal shimmer.
