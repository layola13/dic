词源:

The word "magi" comes from the Greek word μάγοι (magoi), which itself is derived from an Old Persian word *magus.  The original meaning referred to members of a priestly Zoroastrian caste in ancient Persia, known for their wisdom and knowledge of astrology and magic.  The term later broadened in meaning to encompass any wise man or sorcerer.
