gleba:/ˈɡliːbə/| n. |菌柄；子实体的内部组织|The gleba is the spore-bearing tissue within the fruiting body of a fungus, particularly in gasteromycetes (puffballs, earthstars, etc.).  It can vary greatly in texture and color depending on the species.  For example, some puffballs have a white, firm gleba when young, which later turns brown and powdery as the spores mature. |The mature gleba of this puffball was dark brown and powdery.|近义词：spore mass|反义词：无
