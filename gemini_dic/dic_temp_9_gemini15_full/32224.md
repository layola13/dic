词源:
The word "chichi" is of French origin, derived from the French word "chic," meaning stylish or elegant.  However, the English use of "chichi," especially with the doubled "ch," adds a connotation of excessive or pretentious elegance, implying something overly showy and perhaps lacking genuine substance.  The repetition intensifies the negative implication.
