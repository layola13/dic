USAGE->
This word doesn't have verb or adjective forms, and therefore doesn't conjugate or decline in the way that verbs and adjectives do.  The usage is purely nominal.  Therefore, grammatical tenses like past, present, future, etc., and voice (active/passive) are not applicable.  The word functions similarly to the word "water" or "sugar" - in different sentences, it takes different roles depending on prepositional phrases and other grammatical context.
