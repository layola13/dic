myxomycetes:/ˌmɪksoʊˈmaɪsiːts/| n. |黏菌纲，粘菌 |Myxomycetes are a group of organisms that were once classified as fungi but are now considered to be amoeboid protists.  They are characterized by their ability to form plasmodia, multinucleated masses of cytoplasm that can move and engulf food. They exhibit characteristics of both animals and fungi, making their classification complex. | Example: The slime mold *Physarum polycephalum* is a well-studied member of the Myxomycetes.  黏菌多头绒泡菌是黏菌纲中一个被广泛研究的成员。|近义词：slime molds (informal)|反义词：无
