USAGE->
This is not applicable to "http" as it is an abbreviation and not a verb, noun or adjective that can be conjugated.  It doesn't function grammatically in the ways the example word "what" does.  HTTP is a technical term used to describe a protocol, not a word with varied grammatical applications.


PHRASE->
HTTP request = HTTP请求
HTTP response = HTTP响应
HTTP server = HTTP服务器
HTTP client = HTTP客户端
HTTP header = HTTP 头部
