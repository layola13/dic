The word "Meccan's" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a misspelling or a proper noun formed by adding a possessive apostrophe-s to "Meccan."  Therefore, a full lexical analysis as requested is impossible without further context.  Let's analyze what can be understood.

**Possible Interpretations and Analyses:**

**1.  If "Meccan" is intended:**

* **Pronunciation:** /ˈmɛkən/
* **Word Class:** Adjective
* **Translation:** Relating to Mecca, a city in Saudi Arabia, significant in Islam.
* **Analysis:**  Derived from "Mecca," the name of the city. It describes something originating from, connected to, or characteristic of Mecca.
* **Example:**  "Meccan pilgrimage" (麦加朝圣)
* **Synonyms:**  Meccan, relating to Mecca, of Mecca
* **Antonyms:**  N/A (This is a descriptive word, not one with an inherent opposite)
* **Usage:**  The word "Meccan" functions as an adjective and can be used to modify nouns.  It doesn't have tense conjugations like verbs.  It's generally used in descriptions relating to religious or cultural contexts of Islam and Mecca.


**2. If "Meccan's" is intended as a possessive:**

* **Pronunciation:** /ˈmɛkənz/
* **Word Class:** Noun Phrase (Possessive)
* **Translation:** Belonging to or associated with a person or thing named "Meccan" (This is highly unusual, as "Meccan" is not a common personal name).
* **Analysis:** This is a possessive form indicating ownership or association. It implies that something belongs to a person or entity called "Meccan."
* **Example:**  "Meccan's house" (If a person named Meccan existed).  This sentence structure is grammatically correct, but semantically unusual.
* **Synonyms:**  (Depending on the context of what Meccan possesses)
* **Antonyms:**  N/A (Possessive forms don't have antonyms)
* **Usage:**  Used to show possession or association.  Due to the unusual nature of "Meccan" as a name, this usage is highly unlikely.
