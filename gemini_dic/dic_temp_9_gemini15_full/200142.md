词源:  The word "skillet" comes from the Middle English word "skillet," which ultimately derives from the Old Norse word "skyll," meaning "a bowl or vessel."  The "-et" suffix is a diminutive, indicating a small version of something.  Over time, the meaning shifted from a general bowl to the specific type of frying pan we know today.
