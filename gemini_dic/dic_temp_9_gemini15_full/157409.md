Word Origin:

The word "piquantness" derives from the French word "piquant," meaning "pungent," "sharp," or "racy."  This, in turn, comes from the Old French word "piquer," meaning "to prick" or "to sting," ultimately relating to the Latin word "picare," meaning "to peck."  The suffix "-ness" is added to form the noun, indicating a quality or state.
