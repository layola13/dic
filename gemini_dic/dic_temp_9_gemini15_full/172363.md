词源:
The word "putter" likely originated as an imitative word,  onomatopoeic in nature,  describing the sounds of gentle,  insignificant activity.  It's related to the word "putt" (as in golf), suggesting a short,  gentle action.  The verb sense developed from the idea of engaging in small,  unimportant tasks in a leisurely manner.
