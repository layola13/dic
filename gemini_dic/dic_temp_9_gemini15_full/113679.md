The word "macked" doesn't exist as a standard English word with a formal dictionary entry.  It's likely a slang term, a misspelling, or a regionalism.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and detailed grammatical explanation are impossible.  To provide a response, we need more context.  Where did you encounter this word? Knowing the context will help determine its meaning and potential origin.

If you can provide the context (sentence, paragraph, conversation), I can attempt to offer a possible interpretation and explanation based on that context.  For example, it might be:

* **A misspelling:** Perhaps it's meant to be another word, such as "mocked," "packed," or "macked" (as in "macked up," meaning messed up - slang).
* **Slang or dialect:**  It might be a regional slang term with a specific meaning within a particular community or subculture.
* **Neologism:**  A newly coined word not yet recognized in dictionaries.


Without context, I cannot fulfill your request. Please provide more information.
