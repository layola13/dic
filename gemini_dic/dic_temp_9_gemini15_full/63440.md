词源:
The word "entreatment" comes from the Old French word "entretenir," meaning "to entertain, hold converse with, keep up."  This evolved from the Latin "inter tenere," meaning "to hold between, keep together."  The modern English meaning of entreatment, focused on supplication, developed from a sense of holding someone's attention with a plea or request.
