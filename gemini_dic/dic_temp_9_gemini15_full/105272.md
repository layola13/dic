The word "kholah" does not exist in standard English.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
2. **From another language:**  It might be a word from another language. If you can provide the language of origin, I can try to help.
3. **A proper noun or neologism:** It could be a proper noun (like a place name or person's name) or a newly coined word.


Without more information, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical explanations as requested in the format.  Please provide the correct spelling or more context.
