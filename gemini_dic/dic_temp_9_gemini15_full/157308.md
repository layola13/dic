词源:
The word "pinwheeling" is derived from "pinwheel," a toy consisting of a rotating wheel with vanes.  The "-ing" suffix indicates the continuous action of spinning like a pinwheel.  The word "pinwheel" itself combines "pin" (a short, slender piece of metal, suggesting the central axis) and "wheel."
