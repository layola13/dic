The word "outtop" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps the intended word was something else entirely.  More context is needed to guess the correct word.
* **A neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.  Without further information, its meaning and usage are unclear.
* **A proper noun:** It could be a brand name, place name, or a person's name.

To help me provide the analysis you're looking for, please provide more context where you encountered this word.  For example:

* The sentence or phrase where it was used.
* The source where you saw it (website, book, conversation, etc.).
* Any surrounding words that might provide clues to its meaning.
