词源:

The word "nontenableness" is derived from the word "tenable," meaning "able to be maintained or defended against attack or objection."  The prefix "non-" simply means "not," thus creating the antonym "nontenable," meaning "unable to be maintained or defended."  Adding the suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "nontenable" into the noun "nontenableness," signifying the state or quality of being nontenable.


用法说明:

Nontenableness is primarily used as a noun to describe the quality or state of something being indefensible, unsustainable, or illogical. It is often used in formal contexts, such as legal or academic discussions, to express a critical judgment about the weakness or flaw in an argument, theory, or position.  It implies a lack of solid foundation or supporting evidence.
