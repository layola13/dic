词源:
The word "gowk" ultimately derives from Old English *cucu, which referred to the cuckoo bird.  Over time, the word's meaning broadened to include the general sense of "fool" or "simpleton," likely due to the cuckoo's perceived foolishness or lack of parental care.  The Scottish usage is particularly strong, reflecting its continued presence in that dialect.
