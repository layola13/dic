词源:
disconcertedly derives from the verb "disconcert," which is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away from" or "opposite of") and the verb "concert," ultimately stemming from the Old French word "concerter," meaning "to agree," "to arrange," or "to harmonize."  Therefore, "disconcert" originally meant to "unsettle" or "throw into disorder." The adverbial suffix "-edly" is added to create "disconcertedly," signifying the manner in which the action is performed.
