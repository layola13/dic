词源:  The word "indulgers" comes from the verb "indulge," which has roots in the Old French word "endulger," meaning "to yield to; to pamper."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin "indulgere," meaning "to be kind to, to grant, to yield to."  The "-er" suffix transforms the verb into a noun indicating a person who performs the action.
