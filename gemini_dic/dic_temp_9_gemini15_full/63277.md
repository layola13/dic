词源:
The word "enthralling" comes from the verb "enthrall," which itself is from the Old English "inþrallian," meaning "to enslave."  The "en-" prefix intensifies the meaning.  While its original meaning related to enslavement,  its modern usage focuses on the captivating and absorbing nature of something that holds one's attention completely.
