peakedness's:/ˈpiːkd.nəsɪz/ | n. | 顶峰状态的；达到顶峰的；尖端状态的 | The word "peakedness's" is a rather unusual and arguably incorrect formation.  It appears to be an attempt to use the possessive form ('s) on the noun "peakedness," which itself is already a noun describing a state of having peaks or being at a peak.  This double possessive is grammatically awkward and generally avoided.  A more natural way to express the intended meaning would be to use phrases like "the state of its peakedness," "characteristics of its peakedness," or simply "peakedness." |  The mountain's peakedness was breathtaking.  = 这座山的峰峦景色令人叹为观止。  The graph shows the peakedness of sales in December. = 该图表显示了12月份销售额的峰值。|  acme, apex, zenith, culmination |  nadir, bottom, trough |  n.


USAGE->
This word is not commonly used due to its grammatical awkwardness.  Standard English usage would avoid this double possessive.  Therefore, example sentences demonstrating grammatical tenses are not applicable.  Correct phrasing should be used to express the meaning.

PHRASE->
Phrases using "peakedness" would be more appropriate than "peakedness's."  Examples:  degree of peakedness, state of peakedness, evidence of peakedness, time of peakedness, signs of peakedness.
