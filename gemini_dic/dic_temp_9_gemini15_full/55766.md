词源:

The word "diversifier" is derived from the verb "diversify," which itself comes from the Latin word "diversificare."  "Di-" means "apart" or "different," and "versificare" is related to "vertere," meaning "to turn." Thus, the core meaning is "to turn into different things" or "to make different."  The suffix "-er" transforms the verb into a noun, indicating a person or thing that performs the action of diversifying.
