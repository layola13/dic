词源:

The word is a compound of "pinch" (meaning to squeeze tightly) and "cock" (in this context, an archaic term for a valve or tap).  The imagery suggests someone who tightly controls the flow of their money, like a valve restricting the flow of liquid.  The original meaning likely referred to a type of clamp before evolving to its figurative meaning.
