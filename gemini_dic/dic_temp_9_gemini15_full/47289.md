de-evolution:/ˌdiːˌiːvəˈluːʃən/| n.| 退化；反向进化；倒退 | The process of a species or population losing complex features or reverting to simpler forms, often considered a decline from a previous state.  It's a controversial term, as evolution is generally understood as a process of adaptation, not necessarily constant progress. | Example: Some argue that the loss of flight in certain bird species is an example of de-evolution.  某些人认为某些鸟类物种飞行能力的丧失是退化的一个例子。|近义词：regression, devolution, degeneration |反义词：evolution, advancement, progress | 名词
