seminormalness:/ˌsɛmiˈnɔːrmələnəs/| n. |半正态性，准正态性|The state or quality of being seminormal;  a condition approximating but not exactly conforming to the properties of a normal distribution.  It often refers to a statistical distribution that is similar to a normal distribution but with some deviations.| The researcher observed a degree of seminormalness in the data, suggesting a slight departure from a perfect Gaussian distribution.|近义词：near-normality, quasi-normality|反义词：normality, abnormality


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in statistical contexts and does not lend itself to the typical grammatical tense examples (present, past, future, etc.) as shown in the example.  The usage is almost exclusively in noun phrases describing data or distributions.

Examples:

* **A high degree of seminormalness was observed:**  观察到高度的准正态性。
* **The analysis revealed a lack of seminormalness:** 分析显示缺乏准正态性。


PHRASE->

Phrases using "seminormalness" are typically descriptive and technical, focusing on the degree or presence of this statistical property.  It's difficult to provide common phrases in the same way as a common word like "what."  Examples depend heavily on the specific context of statistical analysis.


*The absence of seminormalness in the data necessitated a different analytical approach.*  数据缺乏准正态性，需要采用不同的分析方法。
*The extent of seminormalness will be determined by further testing.*  准正态性的程度将由进一步的测试来确定。
*Despite some deviations, a reasonable level of seminormalness was maintained.* 尽管存在一些偏差，但仍然保持了合理的准正态性水平。
*Analysis of seminormalness is crucial for accurate interpretation of the results.* 对准正态性的分析对于准确解释结果至关重要。
*The model assumes a degree of seminormalness in the error terms.* 该模型假设误差项具有一定的准正态性。
