词源:
The term "self-objectification" is a relatively modern coinage, combining "self" (referring to oneself) with "objectification" (the action of treating someone as a mere object).  "Objectification" itself derives from the word "object," ultimately from Latin "obiectum," the past participle of "obicere," meaning "to throw against, to oppose."  The "-ification" suffix denotes the process of becoming or making something.  Therefore, self-objectification represents the process of turning oneself into an object, typically in the context of being evaluated based on external standards.
