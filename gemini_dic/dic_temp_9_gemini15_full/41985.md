The word "cost-effectivenesses" is derived from the combination of:

* **cost:** From Old French "coster," ultimately from Latin "constare" meaning "to stand together, to consist of."  It refers to the expense or price.

* **effectiveness:** From "effective," combining "effect" (from Latin "effectus," a past participle of "efficere," meaning "to bring about") and "-ive" (a suffix indicating having the nature of).  It refers to the ability to produce a desired result.

* **-ness:** A suffix forming abstract nouns denoting quality, state, or condition.

* **-es:** Plural suffix.

Therefore, "cost-effectivenesses" represents multiple instances of the quality or state of achieving a desired outcome with minimal cost.
