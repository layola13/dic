词源:

The word "exactly" comes from the Old French word "exactement," which itself derives from the Latin word "exactus," the past participle of "exigere," meaning "to demand," "to require," or "to drive out."  The sense of "exact" developed from the idea of something meeting a specific demand or requirement, hence being precise or accurate.
