Etymology:

The word "shoehorn" is a compound word.  It combines "shoe" and "horn."  The "horn" part refers to the original material used to make these tools – animal horn.  Over time, the material changed (to plastic and metal), but the name remained. The use of "horn" in this context likely refers to its curved shape, similar to an animal's horn.
