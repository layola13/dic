词源:

The term "kingmaking" is a compound word formed from "king" and "making."  "King" refers to a male monarch or ruler, while "making" signifies the act of creating or establishing something.  The combined meaning thus points to the act of installing or establishing a king, often through indirect or manipulative means.


用法说明:

Kingmaking is predominantly used in a political context.  It emphasizes the clandestine nature of the process, suggesting that power brokers are working behind the scenes to influence the outcome of an election or succession.  It carries a negative connotation, implying manipulation and a disregard for democratic processes.  Although the term literally refers to the selection of a king, it is now frequently applied to any situation where powerful individuals or groups manipulate events to install their preferred candidate for a position of leadership, regardless of whether that position is a monarchy or an elected office.

1. The media speculated extensively on the kingmaking going on behind closed doors.媒体对幕后进行的国王制造进行了广泛的猜测。

2.  Accusations of kingmaking tarnished the reputation of the party leader.国王制造的指控损害了党领导人的声誉。
