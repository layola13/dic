词源:

The word "preprovoked" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and the verb "provoke" (meaning "to stimulate or incite to action").  Therefore, "preprovoked" literally means "provoked beforehand" or "stimulated in advance."  The word is relatively uncommon and primarily used in formal contexts.
