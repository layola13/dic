polytype:/ˈpɒlitaɪp/| /ˈpɑːlɪtaɪp/ | n. |多型，多型体|A polytype is a species or other taxonomic group that is represented by multiple distinct forms or morphs, often differing in morphology, ecology, or behavior.  These forms may or may not be geographically separated.  The term is often used in biology, particularly in botany and zoology, to describe situations where a single species exhibits considerable variation. |Example:  The butterfly species *Polygonia c-album* is considered a polytype due to its extensive variation in wing pattern and color across its range.  This variation is not sufficient to warrant splitting the species into separate taxa.|近义词：polymorphic species, variant, morph|反义词：monotype
