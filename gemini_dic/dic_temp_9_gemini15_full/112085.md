longinus: /ˈlɒnɡɪnəs/ | n. |隆吉努斯；（古罗马）长枪兵；（指）崇高的风格；雄辩的风格|

英文解析:Longinus is primarily known as the name associated with the author of *On the Sublime*, a treatise on literary criticism that greatly influenced Western aesthetics.  While the true identity of the author remains debated, the work itself is commonly attributed to a figure known as Longinus, possibly referring to Cassius Longinus, a 3rd-century AD Greek rhetorician and philosopher.  The term "Longinian" is used to describe the principles and concepts outlined in the treatise, particularly those relating to the creation of sublime writing.  The word can also refer to a Roman soldier who pierced Jesus' side with a spear, though this is a less common usage.
