The word "instinctive" does not exist in the English language.  It seems you may have made a typo.  Perhaps you meant "instinctual" or "instinctive"? I will provide the analysis for both possibilities.


**1. Instinctual:**

/ɪnˈstɪŋktʃuəl/ | adj. | 本能的；直觉的 |  Relating to or prompted by instinct; done without conscious thought. | Example:  The cat's instinctual reaction was to flee from the dog. 猫的本能反应是逃离狗。  Her instinctual fear of heights prevented her from climbing the mountain. 她本能的恐高阻止了她爬山。 |近义词：intuitive, innate, natural, spontaneous | 反义词：learned, deliberate, conscious | 词性：adjective


**2. Instinctive:**

/ɪnˈstɪŋktɪv/ | adj. | 本能的；直觉的 |  Prompted by instinct; seemingly unlearned or inherent. | Example: The bird's instinctive behavior led it to build a nest. 鸟的本能行为引导它筑巢。 His instinctive response was to protect his family. 他的本能反应是保护家人。 | 近义词：intuitive, innate, natural, spontaneous | 反义词：learned, deliberate, conscious | 词性：adjective


**Etymology (for both):**

Both "instinctual" and "instinctive" derive from the noun "instinct," which comes from the Latin word "instinctus," meaning "incitement, impulse."  The suffix "-ual" and "-ive" are common adjective-forming suffixes in English, both conveying the sense of "having the quality of."
