词源:
From French orchestrer, from orchestre "orchestra," from Italian orchestra, from Greek ὀρχήστρα (orkhēstra), from ὀρχεῖσθαι (orkheisthai) "to dance," from ὄρχος (orkhos) "dancing place."  The original meaning referred to the dancing place in ancient Greek theaters, later evolving to refer to the musicians who played there, and finally to the group of musicians themselves, and the act of arranging and conducting them.
