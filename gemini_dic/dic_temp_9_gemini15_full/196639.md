词源:

The word "settlement" comes from the Old French "setellement,"  itself derived from the verb "setiller," meaning "to settle."  The ultimate origin is the Latin "sedimentum," meaning "a settling down" or "deposit."  This reflects the dual meaning of the word, encompassing both the physical act of establishing a dwelling and the metaphorical act of resolving a conflict.
