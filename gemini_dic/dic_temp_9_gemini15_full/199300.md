词源:  The word "silvers" is the plural form of "silver," which ultimately derives from the Proto-Germanic word *silubrō, meaning "silver." This word further traces back to Proto-Indo-European *h₂élw̥-  meaning "white, shining." The English word "silver" has been in use since Old English (seolfor). The plural "silvers" reflects the standard English pluralization rule.
