nonsuperimposable: /ˌnɑːnˌsuːpərɪmˈpoʊzəbəl/ | adj. | 不可叠加的，不能重合的 |  Describes objects or figures that cannot be superimposed, meaning they cannot be placed exactly on top of each other so that they coincide perfectly. This often applies to chiral molecules in chemistry, where mirror images cannot be perfectly aligned. | Example:  The two molecules are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other. 这两个分子是彼此的不可叠加镜像。  | 近义词: dissimilar, incongruent, distinct | 反义词: superimposable, congruent


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in scientific and technical contexts, particularly in chemistry and mathematics.  There aren't typical tenses or voices to conjugate like a verb, as it's an adjective.  Instead, it modifies nouns.

Example Sentences (with explanations of usage):

Sentence 1: The nonsuperimposable nature of chiral molecules is crucial in understanding their biological activity.  不可叠加的手性分子的性质对于理解它们的生物活性至关重要。(Here, "nonsuperimposable" describes the nature of chiral molecules.)

Sentence 2:  The two shapes are nonsuperimposable; no matter how you rotate them, they will never perfectly overlap. 这两个形状是不可叠加的；无论你怎么旋转它们，它们都不会完全重叠。(Here, "nonsuperimposable" describes the relationship between two shapes.)
