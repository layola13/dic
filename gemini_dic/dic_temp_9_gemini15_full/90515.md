This word, "Huds,"  doesn't have a standard dictionary entry as a standalone word with a rich etymology and diverse usage like "what".  It's primarily a shortened, informal, or regionally specific reference, almost always to the Hudson River Valley in New York State.  Therefore, a detailed breakdown of its grammar usage across tenses etc. is impossible.  It functions simply as a proper noun (or a shortened version of a proper noun). There aren't synonyms or antonyms in the usual sense.  Any grammatical usage would be the same as for any proper noun.

For example:

* **Simple Sentence:** I'm going to the Huds this weekend. (我这个周末要去哈德逊河谷。)
* **Part of a longer sentence:** The artist's inspiration came from the rolling hills of the Huds. (这位艺术家的灵感来自于哈德逊河谷连绵起伏的山丘。)


There are no common phrases specifically using "Huds"  as it’s a highly context-dependent abbreviation.
