larviparous:/lɑːrˈvɪpərəs/ | adj. | 卵胎生的 |  Producing larvae that develop within the body of the parent, then hatch internally or immediately after being expelled.  This differs from oviparity (laying eggs) and viviparity (live birth of fully developed young).| 例句：Many species of sharks are larviparous, giving birth to live young in an advanced larval stage.  许多鲨鱼物种是卵胎生的，产下处于发育较晚幼体阶段的活体幼崽。


The seahorse is an example of a larviparous species. 海马就是一个卵胎生物种的例子。


近义词：ovoviviparous (卵胎生的，但通常指胚胎在卵内发育，直到孵化出来) | 反义词：oviparous (卵生的), viviparous (胎生的)


词源:  From Latin *larva ("ghost, mask, larva") + parere ("to bring forth").  The term reflects the fact that the young are born in a larval state.
