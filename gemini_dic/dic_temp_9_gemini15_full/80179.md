词源:

The word is a combination of "Godforsaken," an adjective meaning abandoned by God or utterly wretched, and the adverbial suffix "-ly."  "Godforsaken" itself comes from the older phrase "forsaken of God," meaning left alone and unprotected by divine intervention.  The use of "God" in this context is not necessarily a reflection of religious belief but rather serves to emphasize the extreme nature of the abandonment or desolation.


用法说明:

Godforsakenly is an adverb used to intensify the description of something negative, emphasizing its unpleasantness, desolation, or misfortune.  It's often used informally and carries a strong emotional charge.  While it contains the word "God," its use is largely secular and expresses frustration or despair rather than theological judgment.  The word is generally used in informal settings and writing.
