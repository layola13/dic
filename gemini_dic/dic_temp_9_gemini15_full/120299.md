词源:

* **mini-**:  This prefix comes from Latin "minimus," meaning "smallest."  It indicates small size or a smaller version of something.

* **calculator**: This word originates from the Latin "calculare," meaning "to calculate,"  itself derived from "calculus," meaning "small stone" (used in ancient counting systems).  The evolution reflects the shift from using physical objects for calculation to using machines.
