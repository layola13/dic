词源:

The word "expropriable" is derived from the verb "expropriate," which itself comes from the Latin prefix "ex-" (out, from) and the Latin verb "proprius" (one's own).  Therefore, "expropriate" literally means "to take something from its owner." The suffix "-able" indicates that something is capable of being expropriated.
