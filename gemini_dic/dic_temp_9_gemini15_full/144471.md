The word "outterm" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  It might be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a technical term from a specific field, or a word from a dialect or jargon.  More context is needed to understand its meaning and potential usage.
