prewilling:/ˌpriːˈwɪlɪŋ/| adj.|预先愿意的，乐意的|  This word is not a standard English word. It appears to be a newly coined word, combining "pre-" (meaning before) and "willing" (meaning ready or agreeable). Therefore, a standard dictionary definition does not exist.  Its meaning would be inferred from its context.  It suggests a willingness that exists before a request or action is made. | Example: He was prewilling to help, so I didn't even have to ask. 他事先就乐意帮忙，所以我甚至都不用求他。|近义词:  proactive, eager, ready, predisposed |反义词: reluctant, unwilling, hesitant, averse | adj.
