词源:
The word "predisagree" is a relatively modern coinage, formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") with the verb "disagree."  It reflects a growing need to describe the act of anticipating or having a pre-existing disagreement.  There's no ancient root word to trace back.  It's a semantic blend of existing morphemes.
