discolith:/ˈdɪskəˌlɪθ/| n. |椎骨化石|A discolith is a fossilized vertebral centrum, or body of a vertebra.  These fossils are important for understanding the evolution and paleobiology of vertebrates. They are often found in sedimentary rocks and can provide valuable information about the age and environment of the rock formation.|Example:  The paleontologists discovered several discoliths belonging to ancient fish species. 古生物学家发现了属于古代鱼类的几块椎骨化石。|近义词:vertebral fossil, centrum fossil|反义词:N/A
