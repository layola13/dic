词源:

The word "slick" itself originates from the Old Norse word "slikkr," meaning "smooth" or "slippery."  Over time, it evolved to describe things that are smooth to the touch, and later, figuratively, to describe someone who is smooth and skillful in their actions or speech, often implying a lack of genuineness or a degree of deceptiveness.  The "-est" suffix denotes the superlative degree, indicating the highest degree of the quality.


用法说明:

slickest can describe:


1.  Physical smoothness:  A slickest surface, a slickest car (referring to its appearance).

2.  Skillful performance:  A slickest performance, a slickest athlete, a slickest maneuver.

3.  Deceptively smooth actions or speech:  A slickest salesman, a slickest politician, a slickest lie.  This usage often carries a negative connotation, suggesting manipulation or dishonesty.


The choice of "slickest" over other synonyms depends on the context and the nuance you want to convey.  "Smoothest" focuses purely on smoothness, while "most skillful" emphasizes expertise.  "Most cunning" highlights the deceptive aspect.  The "slickest" often combines elements of all these, emphasizing both smoothness and a potentially manipulative element.
