The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "fugitiveness," which derives from the adjective "fugitive" (from Latin *fugitivus, from fugere "to flee").  Therefore, "nonfugitiveness" literally means "not the state of being fugitive" or "not the quality of fleeing or escaping."
