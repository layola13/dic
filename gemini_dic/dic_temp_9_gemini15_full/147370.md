USAGE->
This word is a relatively uncommon neologism (newly coined word). There is no established usage pattern across different tenses because it is not a standard word found in dictionaries.  The tense would be applied to the verb it modifies, not to the adjective itself.  For example:

They were overneglectful in their duties. (Past tense, describing a past state of being)
He is being overneglectful towards his health. (Present continuous, describing an ongoing action)
She has been overneglectful of her responsibilities. (Present perfect, describing a past action with present consequences)


PHRASE->
There are no established phrases using "overneglectful" due to its rarity.  One might theoretically construct phrases like:

"demonstrate overneglectful behavior", "an overneglectful attitude", "overneglectful of their needs".  However, these phrases would sound unusual and are not typical English usage.
