catadioptrical:/ˌkætædiˈɒptrɪkəl/ | adj. | 反射折射的；兼用反射和折射的 | Combining or using both reflection and refraction of light.  Catadioptrical systems are often used in telescopes and other optical instruments to improve image quality and reduce aberrations. | Example: The new telescope uses a catadioptrical lens system.  新型望远镜使用反射折射透镜系统。 | 近义词：reflective-refractive | 反义词：refractive-only, reflective-only


USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective, so tense conjugation does not apply.  Example sentences will demonstrate its usage in different sentence structures.

Declarative Sentence:
The catadioptrical design of the headlight improved visibility.  车灯的反射折射设计提高了能见度。

Interrogative Sentence:
Is this a catadioptrical telescope? 这是一个反射折射望远镜吗？


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "catadioptrical".  Phrases would involve the use of the adjective in a descriptive manner within longer phrases.  For example:

"catadioptrical optical system" 反射折射光学系统
"high-performance catadioptrical lens" 高性能反射折射镜头
"catadioptrical imaging technique" 反射折射成像技术
"advantages of catadioptrical design" 反射折射设计的优点
"limitations of a catadioptrical system" 反射折射系统的局限性


词源:
The word "catadioptrical" is derived from the combination of two Greek words:

* **kata- (κατά):**  A prefix meaning "down," "against," or "according to." In this context, it implies reflection back.
* **dia- (διά):** A prefix meaning "through," "across," or "between."  In this context, it implies transmission or refraction.
* **optron (ὄπτρον):** Meaning "mirror" or "optical instrument."

Therefore, "catadioptrical" literally means "relating to both reflection and refraction of light."
