词源:

The word "incogitable" is derived from the Latin prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "cogitable," which comes from the verb "cogitare" meaning "to think" or "to consider."  Therefore, "incogitable" literally means "not thinkable" or "not imaginable."

用法说明:

"Incogitable" is an adjective used to describe something that is so extraordinary, complex, or shocking that it is beyond the capacity of the human mind to comprehend or imagine. It emphasizes the extreme difficulty, if not impossibility, of forming a mental picture or understanding of something.  It's a stronger word than simply "unimaginable," suggesting a fundamental inability to grasp the concept, not merely a lack of imagination.
