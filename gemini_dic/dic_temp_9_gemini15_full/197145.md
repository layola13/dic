The word "shangqing" is not an English word.  It appears to be a transliteration of a word from another language, likely Chinese.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, etymology, or usage in English as requested in the template.  To provide the requested information, please provide an English word or clarify the language of origin of "shangqing".
