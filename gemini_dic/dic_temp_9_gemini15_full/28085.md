capillary:/ˈkæpɪləri/ | n. |毛细血管；毛细管 | A tiny blood vessel that connects arteries and veins, allowing for the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between blood and tissues.  Capillaries are also thin tubes used in various scientific instruments. |例句：Blood flows from arteries into capillaries and then into veins.  血液从动脉流入毛细血管，然后流入静脉。 |例句：The experiment used a capillary tube to measure the surface tension of the liquid.  实验使用毛细管测量液体的表面张力。 |近义词：vessel, tube |反义词：artery, vein (in the context of blood vessels)
