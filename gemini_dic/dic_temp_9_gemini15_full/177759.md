词源:
re- (prefix indicating again or anew) + categoriz(ation) (from category)

The word "recategorization" is a relatively modern word, formed by adding the prefix "re-" to "categorization," reflecting the process of categorizing something again or differently.  The root "category" originates from the Greek word "kategoría," meaning "accusation, predication, assertion," later evolving to mean "class, kind."
