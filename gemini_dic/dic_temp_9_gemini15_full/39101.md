词源：The word "confrontational" is derived from the verb "confront," which comes from the Old French word "confronter," meaning "to bring face to face."  The prefix "con-" means "together," and "fronter" is related to the Latin word "frons," meaning "forehead" or "face." Therefore, the original meaning implied bringing people face to face, often in a challenging or accusatory manner. The suffix "-ational" transforms the verb into an adjective describing a quality or tendency.
