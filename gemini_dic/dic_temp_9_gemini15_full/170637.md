词源:

* **pseudo-**:  From Greek *pseudēs*, meaning "false," "lying," or "pretended."

* **messianic**: From Hebrew *mashiach* (מָשִׁיחַ), meaning "anointed one," referring to a divinely appointed king or leader prophesied in Jewish scripture.  This term was adopted into Christianity to refer to Jesus Christ.

Therefore, "pseudo-messianic" literally means "falsely anointed one" or "falsely claiming to be a messiah."
