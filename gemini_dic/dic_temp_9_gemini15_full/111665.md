loci:/ˈloʊsaɪ/ | n. |基因座；位置；场所 |The plural of locus.  Refers to specific locations on a chromosome or genome where particular genes or DNA sequences are located.  It can also refer to a place or site generally. |例句：The loci of the genes responsible for eye color have been identified. 基因负责眼睛颜色的基因座已经被识别出来了。|近义词：location, site, position, place |反义词：N/A


USAGE->
