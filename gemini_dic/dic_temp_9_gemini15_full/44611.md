词源:
The word "crowder" comes directly from the verb "crowd," meaning to fill or gather in a large, dense mass.  The suffix "-er" is an agent suffix, indicating a person or thing that performs the action of the verb.  The word's origins trace back to the Middle English word "crowd," which likely evolved from Old English words related to pushing and pressing together.
