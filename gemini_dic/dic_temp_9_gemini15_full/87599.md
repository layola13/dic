heterotherm:/ˈhɛtərəʊθɜːrm/| adj.|异温动物|An animal whose body temperature varies with its environment, as opposed to a homeotherm (whose body temperature is relatively constant).  Heterotherms can exhibit both poikilothermy (variable body temperature) and homeothermy, depending on the circumstances. For example, a hibernating mammal is a heterotherm because its body temperature drops significantly during hibernation. |Example:  Bats are heterotherms; they maintain a high body temperature during activity but allow their temperature to drop during torpor. 蝙蝠是异温动物；它们在活动时保持较高的体温，但在麻痹状态下会让体温下降。|近义词：poikilotherm (often used interchangeably, though heterotherm is more precise)|反义词：homeotherm|

一般过去时:
Scientists studied the heterotherm's behavior. = 科学家研究了这种异温动物的行为。
That species was classified as a heterotherm. = 那个物种被归类为异温动物。


现在完成时:
Researchers have discovered new aspects of heterothermy. = 研究人员发现了异温现象的新方面。
We have observed many heterotherms in this habitat. = 我们在这个栖息地观察到了许多异温动物。


过去完成时:
They had already identified the animal as a heterotherm before the study began. = 在研究开始之前，他们就已经确定该动物是异温动物。
The scientists had learned a lot about heterotherms through their research. = 科学家们通过他们的研究了解了很多关于异温动物的知识。


将来时:
We will study more heterotherms next year. = 我们明年将研究更多的异温动物。
The researchers will publish their findings on heterothermy. = 研究人员将发表他们关于异温现象的研究结果。


虚拟语气:
If this animal were a homeotherm, its metabolic rate would be different. = 如果这只动物是恒温动物，它的新陈代谢率将会不同。

疑问句:
Is this reptile a heterotherm or a homeotherm? = 这种爬行动物是异温动物还是恒温动物？
What are the key characteristics of a heterotherm? = 异温动物的主要特征是什么？


否定句:
That animal is not a heterotherm; it's a homeotherm. = 那只动物不是异温动物；它是恒温动物。
The study did not find any evidence of heterothermy in this species. = 该研究没有发现该物种存在异温现象的任何证据。
