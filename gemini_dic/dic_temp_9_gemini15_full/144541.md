词源：
The word "outvoice" is a relatively straightforward combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent than," "surpassing") and the verb "voice" (to express in words; to utter).  Therefore, it literally means "to surpass in vocal expression or volume."  It's a relatively modern formation, not found in older dictionaries but easily understood due to its transparent construction.
