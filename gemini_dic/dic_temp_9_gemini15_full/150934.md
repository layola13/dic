paralogism:/ˈpærəlɒdʒɪzəm/ | n. |似是而非的论证；谬误推理 |A paralogism is a flawed argument that appears superficially sound but contains a logical fallacy.  It's a type of incorrect reasoning that seems plausible but is actually invalid.  Unlike a sophism, which is intentionally deceptive, a paralogism is usually unintentional, stemming from a misunderstanding of logic or a mistake in reasoning. |Example: "All cats are mammals. All dogs are mammals. Therefore, all cats are dogs." This is a paralogism because it commits the fallacy of the undistributed middle term. |近义词：fallacy, sophism, error, blunder |反义词：valid argument, sound reasoning
