词源:

The word "discretion" originates from the Old French word "discrétion," which itself comes from the Latin word "discernere," meaning "to separate," "to distinguish," or "to discern."  The prefix "dis-" implies a separation or distinguishing, while "-cretion" relates to the act of separating or choosing.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the careful judgment and wise choice implied in making such distinctions, especially in sensitive matters.
