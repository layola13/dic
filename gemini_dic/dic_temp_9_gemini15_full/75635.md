词源:
The word "fugleman" comes from the German word "Flügelmann", meaning "wingman" or "flanker".  In military formations, the fugleman was originally positioned at the wing or flank of a body of troops. Over time, the meaning shifted to refer to the leader of a group, particularly in military drills.
