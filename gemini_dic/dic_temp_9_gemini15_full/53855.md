近义词：dissatisfaction, unhappiness, dissatisfaction, frustration, resentment | 反义词：contentment, satisfaction, happiness


词源:  The word "discontentment" is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of"), the adjective "content" (meaning "satisfied" or "happy"), and the suffix "-ment" (meaning "the state or condition of").  Therefore, "discontentment" literally means "the state of not being content". The root of "content" can be traced back to the Old French "content," and ultimately to the Latin "contentus," the past participle of "contēnēre," meaning "to hold together," "to restrain," or "to contain."  The sense of satisfaction likely developed from the idea of having one's desires held in check, fulfilled, or contained.
