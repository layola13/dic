The word "plani" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* It's a technical term: It might be specific to a particular field (e.g., scientific, technical, or a specific dialect).  If so, please provide context.
* It's a neologism: It could be a newly coined word not yet widely recognized.
* It's a word from another language: It might be a word borrowed from another language.
