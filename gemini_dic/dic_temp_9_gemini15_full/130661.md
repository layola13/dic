USAGE->
This word is extremely rare and unlikely to appear in common usage.  Its complexity makes demonstrating grammatical tense usage impractical and misleading.  The focus should be on understanding its meaning and the components of its formation.


PHRASE->
Given the word's rarity, providing common phrases is not feasible.  The word itself is a complex noun and does not readily lend itself to phrasal constructions.
