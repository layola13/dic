multipoles:/ˈmʌltiˌpoʊlz/ | n. |多极子 |A multipole is a generalization of the concepts of a monopole, dipole, and quadrupole to an arbitrary number of poles.  In physics, it refers to a system of charges or magnetic poles whose combined effect can be described by a multipole expansion. This expansion expresses the potential or field produced by the system as a sum of terms, each representing a different order of multipole.  The lower-order terms (monopole, dipole, quadrupole) are typically dominant at larger distances from the source. | Example: The magnetic field of the Earth can be approximated as a dipole, but higher-order multipoles are needed for a more accurate description.  The interaction between molecules can often be described using a multipole expansion. |近义词：multipolar system, higher-order poles |反义词：monopole (in the context of a single pole)
