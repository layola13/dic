词源:

* **ir-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "without."
* **resolv-**:  From the Latin "resolvere," meaning "to loosen, untie, solve." This root also gives us words like "resolve," "resolution," and "soluble."
* **-able**: A suffix indicating capability or possibility.
* **-ness**: A suffix forming nouns of quality or state.


Therefore, "irresolubleness" literally means "the state of not being solvable."
