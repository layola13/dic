nonassociative: /ˌnɒnəˈsoʊʃieɪtɪv/ | adj. | 非结合性的，非结合的 | Not following the associative law;  in which the result of an operation on three or more elements depends on the order in which the operations are performed.  For example, in nonassociative operations, (a*b)*c ≠ a*(b*c). This is in contrast to associative operations, where the order of operations does not affect the result. |
