polygenic:/ˌpɒliˈdʒɛnɪk/ /ˌpɑːliˈdʒɛnɪk/| adj.|多基因的；多基因遗传的|Relating to or determined by multiple genes.  Polygenic inheritance refers to the inheritance of a trait that is controlled by multiple genes, each having a small effect on the overall phenotype. This contrasts with monogenic inheritance, where a single gene determines a trait.|Example: Height is a polygenic trait, influenced by many genes and environmental factors.  身高是一个多基因性状，受许多基因和环境因素的影响。|近义词：multifactorial, pleiotropic|反义词：monogenic


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Many traits are polygenic. = 许多性状是多基因的。
This disease is polygenic in nature. = 这种疾病本质上是多基因的。


一般过去时:
Scientists discovered that the trait was polygenic. = 科学家发现该性状是多基因的。
Researchers believed the condition to be polygenic. = 研究人员认为这种情况是多基因的。


现在完成时:
Studies have shown that intelligence is polygenic. = 研究表明智力是多基因的。
Scientists have confirmed that the disease has a polygenic basis. = 科学家已经证实该疾病具有多基因基础。


过去完成时:
They had already determined that the characteristic was polygenic. = 他们之前已经确定该特征是多基因的。
Researchers had suspected a polygenic inheritance pattern. = 研究人员曾怀疑存在多基因遗传模式。


将来时:
Future research will explore the polygenic nature of this disorder. = 未来的研究将探索这种疾病的多基因性质。
We will investigate the polygenic components of the phenotype. = 我们将调查表型的多基因成分。


虚拟语气:
If the trait were polygenic, the inheritance would be more complex. = 如果该性状是多基因的，则遗传会更复杂。
If it were polygenic, we would expect a wider range of phenotypes. = 如果它是多基因的，我们会期望更广泛的表型范围。


被动语态:
The trait was considered to be polygenic by the researchers. = 该性状被研究人员认为是多基因的。
The complexity of the phenotype was explained by its polygenic nature. = 表型的复杂性可以用其多基因性质来解释。


疑问句:
Is this condition polygenic or monogenic? = 这种情况是多基因的还是单基因的？
Are most human traits polygenic? = 人类的大多数性状是多基因的吗？


否定句:
The trait is not monogenic; it is polygenic. = 该性状不是单基因的；它是多基因的。
This particular characteristic is not polygenic, but monogenic. = 这个特定特征不是多基因的，而是单基因的。
