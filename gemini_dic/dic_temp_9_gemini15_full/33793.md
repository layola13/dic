词源:
The word "circumdenudation" is a combination of:

* **circum-**:  A Latin prefix meaning "around," "about," or "surrounding."
* **denudation**: From the Latin "denudare," meaning "to strip bare" or "to uncover."  This word itself is a combination of "de-" (away) and "nudare" (to make naked).

Therefore, circumdenudation literally means the process of stripping bare or uncovering something from all around.
