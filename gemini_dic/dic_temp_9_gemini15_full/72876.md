词源:
The word "folliful" is not found in standard dictionaries and appears to be a relatively rare or obsolete word. Its likely origin is a combination of elements suggesting "folly" (lack of good sense) and possibly a suffix related to  "-ful" (full of).  Its precise etymology requires further investigation into archaic or dialectal English sources.
