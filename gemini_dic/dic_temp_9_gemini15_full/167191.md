The word "pretempts" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or looking word?
* **It's a newly coined word or slang:** If it's a very recent invention, it won't be in dictionaries yet.  More context would be helpful to understand its meaning.
* **It's a proper noun:**  If it's a name or place, providing more context is needed.


Please provide more information or clarify the spelling so I can assist you.
