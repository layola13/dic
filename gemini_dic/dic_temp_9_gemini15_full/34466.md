The word "clavy" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It might be:

* A misspelling:  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
* A neologism: A newly coined word not yet widely adopted.
* A technical term: Specific to a certain field or jargon.
* A proper noun:  A name or place.


To provide the analysis you requested, I need a correctly spelled and contextually appropriate word.
