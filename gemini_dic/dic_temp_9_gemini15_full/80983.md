gradable:/ˈɡrædəbəl/ | adj. | 可分的；可测量的；可比較的；程度上的 |  An adjective that can be used in comparative or superlative forms, or modified by adverbs of degree (e.g., very, quite, rather).  It describes qualities that can exist in varying degrees.  For example, "hot" is gradable because something can be very hot, quite hot, or rather hot.  In contrast, "dead" is typically not gradable, as something is either dead or not dead. | 例句：  The temperature is gradable; it can be slightly warm, moderately warm, or very warm.  温度是可测量的；它可以是稍微温暖，适度温暖或非常温暖。

The pain is gradable; it can be mild, moderate, or severe. 疼痛是可分的；它可以是轻微的，中等的或严重的。
