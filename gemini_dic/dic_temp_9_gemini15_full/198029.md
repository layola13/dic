词源:  The word "shoddy" itself originates from the 19th century, referring to a type of low-quality fabric made from recycled wool.  The suffix "-est" denotes the superlative degree, indicating the highest degree of shoddiness.  Therefore, "shoddiest" signifies the absolute worst in terms of quality and workmanship.
