词源:

The word "dethrone" comes from the Old French word "destroner," which is a combination of "de-" (meaning "from" or "off") and "troner" (meaning "to enthrone").  The ultimate root lies in the Latin word "thronus," meaning "throne."  Therefore, "dethrone" literally means "to remove from a throne."
