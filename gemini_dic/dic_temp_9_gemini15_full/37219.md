词源:
The word "comeuppance" originates from the earlier phrase "to come up with one's comeuppance," which dates back to the late 16th century.  The "come up" part suggests the sudden and unexpected nature of the punishment.  The meaning of "comeuppance" itself evolved over time, solidifying its current meaning in the 19th century.  The exact etymology of "comeuppance" remains debated, with suggestions linking it to various older words and phrases, but the core idea of a sudden, deserved punishment remains consistent.
