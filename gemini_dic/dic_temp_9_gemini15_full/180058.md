reflectivities:/ˌriːflekˈtɪvɪtiz/| n. |反射率；反射性|The ability of a surface to reflect light or other radiation.  It is often expressed as a percentage of the incident radiation that is reflected.  The reflectivities of different materials vary widely depending on factors such as the wavelength of the radiation, the angle of incidence, and the surface roughness.|例句：The high reflectivities of the mirrors are crucial for the laser system's performance. 高反射率的镜子对于激光系统的性能至关重要。

The study examined the spectral reflectivities of various paints.  这项研究考察了各种油漆的光谱反射率。
