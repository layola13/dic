词源:
The word "disallowance" is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the noun "allowance," which comes from the Old French word "alower" meaning "to allow," ultimately deriving from the Latin "allocare" (to assign a place, to allot). Therefore, "disallowance" literally means "the state of not being allowed."
