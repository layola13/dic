gondwana:/ɡɒndˈwɑːnə/ | n. |冈瓦纳古陆|A supercontinent that existed from the Neoproterozoic (about 550 million years ago) until the Jurassic (about 180 million years ago).  It included most of the landmasses in today's Southern Hemisphere, as well as Arabia and the Indian subcontinent, which are now in the Northern Hemisphere.  The breakup of Gondwana is a significant event in Earth's geological history, leading to the formation of the continents as we know them today. |例句：The breakup of Gondwana led to the formation of many of the continents we see today. 冈瓦纳古陆的裂解导致了我们今天看到的许多大陆的形成。

The discovery of similar fossils and geological formations on widely separated continents provided strong evidence for the existence and subsequent breakup of Gondwana.  类似的化石和地质构造在广泛分离的大陆上的发现，为冈瓦纳古陆的存在及其后来的分裂提供了强有力的证据。|近义词：supercontinent (泛大陆)|反义词：N/A
