词源:

* **dis-:**  A prefix meaning "away from," "opposite of," or "reversal of."
* **enthrall:**  To hold spellbound; to charm or fascinate completely; to enslave.  This word itself has roots in Old English:
    * **in-:**  A prefix meaning "in" or "into."
    * **thral:**  A slave or captive (from Old English *þræl*).
* **-ment:** A suffix forming nouns of action or state.


Therefore, disenthrallment literally means the action or state of being freed from a state of being enthralled (i.e., enslaved, captivated, or charmed).
