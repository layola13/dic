exorhiza:/ˌɛksoʊˈraɪzə/| n. | 外生根 |  Exorhiza refers to a type of root system where the roots arise from the stem above the ground, rather than from the radicle (embryonic root) below the ground. This is a characteristic of some epiphytic plants and certain mangrove species. The roots are often exposed to the air and may have specialized structures for aerial respiration.  | Example:  Many mangrove species exhibit exorhiza, allowing them to thrive in oxygen-poor, waterlogged soils.  许多红树林物种表现出外生根，这使得它们能够在缺氧的、积水的土壤中茁壮成长。 | 近义词: aerial roots (though not always a perfect synonym, as aerial roots can have other origins) | 反义词: endorrhiza (where roots develop from the radicle within the soil) |  n.
