microcyst: /ˈmaɪkroʊsɪst/ | n. | 微囊藻；微囊胞 | A microscopic, usually spherical, colonial form of certain cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), often associated with harmful algal blooms.  They can produce toxins that are harmful to humans and animals. | Example: The lake was closed due to a large microcyst bloom.  湖泊因大量的微囊藻水华而关闭。 |近义词：cyanobacteria colony (蓝细菌菌落), algal bloom (藻华) | 反义词: None specifically, but terms like "clear water" or "healthy aquatic ecosystem" could be considered opposites in the context of harmful algal blooms.
