regularized:/ˈrɛɡjʊləraɪzd/| adj. |正则化的；规范化的；有规律的 |  Made regular or conforming to a standard;  having been subjected to regularization.  The term often refers to techniques in statistics and machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty to the complexity of the model. | 例句：The regularized model performed better on unseen data than the unregularized model.  正则化模型在未见数据上的表现优于非正则化模型。 | 例句：The company implemented regularized procedures to improve efficiency. 公司实施了规范化流程以提高效率。| 近义词：standardized, normalized, systematized | 反义词：irregular, unconstrained, chaotic | 形容词
