词源：
From Middle French *patriote (16th century), from Italian patriota, from Late Latin patriota, from Greek patriōtēs "fellow-countryman, compatriot", from patria "fatherland, native land".  The Greek word is ultimately derived from patēr "father".  The modern sense of "one who loves and defends one's country" developed in the 18th century.
