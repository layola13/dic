/ˌoʊvərˈfɪərflənəsɪz/ | n. |过度恐惧；过分担忧 |The word "overfearfulnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a non-standard formation, likely created by adding a pluralizing "-es" to the already non-standard word "overfearfulness".  "Overfearfulness" itself is an uncommon and somewhat awkward combination of "over" (meaning excessively) and "fearfulness" (meaning the state of being fearful).  A more natural way to express the concept would be to use words like "excessive fears," "exaggerated anxieties," or "pathological anxieties".  There are no standard usages, synonyms, or antonyms for this non-standard word. Because it is not a real word, providing grammatical examples is not possible.
