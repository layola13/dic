This request is impossible to fulfill completely as the word "{melia}" is not a standalone word in English with a readily available dictionary definition and etymology.  It's likely a part of a larger word or a misspelling.  To provide a response in the requested format, I need a valid English word.


If you meant a specific word containing "melia" as a root or part, please provide the correct spelling.  For example, "amelia" or words from the genus *Melia*.  Then I can provide the requested detailed analysis.
