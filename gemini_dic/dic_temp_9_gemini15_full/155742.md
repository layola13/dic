The word "phonetics" is not provided in the prompt.  The prompt asks for a detailed analysis of the word "{phonetics's}", which is grammatically incorrect.  "Phonetics" is a noun; adding "'s" makes it possessive but is unusual in this context.  It's likely a typo.  I will analyze "phonetics" instead.
