The word "orbate" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* It's a neologism:  A newly coined word not yet widely accepted.
* It's a technical term:  Specific to a particular field (e.g., science, technology).
* It's a proper noun:  A name of a person, place, or thing.

If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer a more accurate analysis.
