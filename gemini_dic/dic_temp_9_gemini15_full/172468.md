词源:
* **pyo-**:  From Greek πῦον (pūon), meaning "pus".
* **pneumo-**: From Greek πνεῦμα (pneuma), meaning "breath" or "air".
* **thorax**: From Greek θώραξ (thōrax), meaning "chest" or "breastplate".

Therefore, pyopneumothorax literally means "pus-air-chest," accurately reflecting the condition's nature.
