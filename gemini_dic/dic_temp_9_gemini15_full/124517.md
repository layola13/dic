词源:
The word "mountable" is derived from the verb "mount," meaning to fix or attach something, or to climb something.  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or possibility.  The root of "mount" traces back to Old French *monter and ultimately to Latin *mons, montis meaning "mountain".  Thus, the original sense of "mount" involved climbing a mountain, and this expanded to include other forms of fixing or attaching things.
