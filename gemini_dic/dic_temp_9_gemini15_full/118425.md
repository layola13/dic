词源:
The word "merrythought" is a somewhat mysterious one.  The "merry" part likely refers to the joyful act of making a wish associated with the bone, although other less likely interpretations exist.  "Thought"  here derives from the Old English word *þōht*, meaning "thought," but it's also connected to the idea of "thing" or "object," reflecting the bone itself. The combination created a name that describes the bone and its associated ritual.
