词源:

The word "foresighted" combines "fore" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and "sighted" (related to "sight" and implying perception or understanding).  The "sighted" part ultimately derives from Old English *sihþ, meaning "sight".  Therefore, "foresighted" literally means "having sight of the future".
