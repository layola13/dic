grindability: /ˌɡrɪndəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可磨性，易磨性 | The ease with which a material can be ground or pulverized.  This property is important in various industries, including mining, pharmaceuticals, and food processing.  The grindability of a material is often determined by its hardness, brittleness, and particle size distribution. | The high grindability of this ore makes it relatively inexpensive to process.  | 近义词：friability, pulverizability | 反义词：uncrushable, unbreakable
