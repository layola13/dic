词源:
The word "infrigidate" is derived from the Latin word "frigidus," meaning "cold."  The prefix "in-" intensifies the meaning.  Therefore, "infrigidate" literally means "to make extremely cold."  While its literal meaning pertains to temperature, its usage has expanded to encompass emotional coldness or indifference.
