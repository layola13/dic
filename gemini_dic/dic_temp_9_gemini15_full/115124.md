词源:
The word "mangle" ultimately derives from the Old French word "mangler," meaning "to mangle, mutilate, or mar."  This, in turn, has roots in the Germanic languages, with possible connections to words suggesting "to crush" or "to chew."  The evolution reflects a semantic shift from a more general sense of rough handling to the specific sense of severe damage.
