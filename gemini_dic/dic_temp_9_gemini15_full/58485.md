The word "dudish" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a regional dialect word, a neologism (newly coined word), or slang.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical description are impossible.  To provide a response in the requested format would be inaccurate and misleading.

To help you, I need more context. Where did you encounter this word? Knowing the source might help determine its meaning and potential origin.
