词源:  From the verb "divulge," which comes from the Old French word "divulguer," meaning "to make public," ultimately from the Latin "divulgare," meaning "to make common, spread abroad," from "dis-" (apart) + "vulgare" (to make common).  The "-ences" suffix indicates a plural noun form, referencing multiple instances of divulging or the things divulged.
