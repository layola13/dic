词源:

The word "renouncement" is derived from the verb "renounce," which comes from Old French *renoncier, composed of the prefix *re- (again, back) and the verb *oncier, from Latin *nuntiare (to announce, declare).  The meaning evolved from the idea of "declaring again" or "re-announcing" something, specifically to formally declare the giving up of something.  The suffix "-ment" is a noun-forming suffix indicating the action or process.
