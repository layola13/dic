positionless:/pəˈzɪʃənles/| adj. |无位置的；非定位的；无固定位置的 | Lacking a fixed position or location; not having a defined or assigned position.  The term often implies a lack of structural or inherent position, rather than simply being unlocated at a particular moment.  It can be used in various contexts, including physics, linguistics, and computer science. |例句：The electrons in a cloud of gas are positionless.|近义词：unlocated, undefined, indeterminate, free-floating |反义词：fixed, located, defined, stationary


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The particles remain positionless. = 这些粒子保持无固定位置。
The system is positionless in this configuration. = 在这种配置下，系统没有固定位置。


一般过去时:
The object was positionless before the collision. = 物体在碰撞前没有固定位置。
The data was positionless in the memory. = 数据在内存中没有固定位置。


现在完成时:
The research has shown that the particles have remained positionless. = 研究表明这些粒子一直保持无固定位置。
The software has successfully handled positionless data points. = 软件已成功处理无固定位置的数据点。


过去完成时:
The electrons had been positionless before the magnetic field was applied. = 在施加磁场之前，电子一直处于无固定位置状态。
The system had remained positionless until the coordinates were defined. = 直到坐标被定义之前，系统一直保持无固定位置。


将来时:
The particles will remain positionless unless external forces act upon them. = 除非外力作用于粒子，否则它们将保持无固定位置。
The program will be able to handle positionless inputs. = 该程序将能够处理无固定位置的输入。


虚拟语气:
If the particles were positionless, they would behave differently. = 如果粒子没有固定位置，它们的行为就会不同。
I wish the data were positionless, it would simplify the analysis. = 我希望数据没有固定位置，这将简化分析。


被动语态:
Positionless data points are often difficult to analyze. = 无固定位置的数据点通常难以分析。
The positionless nature of the system was observed. = 系统的无固定位置特性被观察到。


疑问句:
Are the electrons positionless in this state? = 在这种状态下，电子是否没有固定位置？
Is the element positionless within the structure? = 该元素在结构中是否没有固定位置？


否定句:
The atoms are not positionless; they are arranged in a lattice. = 原子并非没有固定位置；它们排列在晶格中。
The data points are not positionless; they are clearly defined. = 数据点并非没有固定位置；它们是明确定义的。


PHRASE->
positionless data = 无固定位置的数据
positionless particles = 无固定位置的粒子
positionless elements = 无固定位置的元素
positionless representation = 无固定位置的表示
positionless analysis = 无固定位置的分析


词源:
The word "positionless" is a combination of "position" and the suffix "-less," meaning "without."  "Position" originates from the Old French word "position,"  ultimately derived from the Latin "positionem" (nominative "positio"), meaning "a placing, setting, situation." The suffix "-less" has Germanic origins.
