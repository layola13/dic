chalazal: /ˈkæləzəl/ | adj. |  胚珠的珠心端的 | Relating to the chalaza, the part of an ovule where the integuments are fused to the nucellus.  It refers to the structure connecting the embryo sac to the micropyle in a seed. | The chalazal end of the ovule is where the vascular bundles enter.  珠孔端的胚珠部分血管束进入的地方。|  近义词：hilum (in some contexts) | 反义词：micropylar


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The chalazal end of the ovule receives nutrients. = 胚珠的珠心端接受养分。

过去完成时:
The ovule had already developed a distinct chalazal region before fertilization. = 受精前胚珠已经形成了明显的珠心端区域。
They had previously investigated the role of the chalazal tissue in seed development. = 他们之前研究过珠心端组织在种子发育中的作用。


将来时:
We will analyze the chalazal cells using advanced microscopy techniques. = 我们将使用先进的显微技术分析珠心端细胞。
Further research will explore the function of the chalazal connection. =  进一步的研究将探索珠心端连接的功能。


虚拟语气:
