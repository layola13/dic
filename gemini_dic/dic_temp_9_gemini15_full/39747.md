词源:
The word "consolation" comes from the Latin word "consolatio," which is derived from the verb "consolari," meaning "to comfort" or "to console."  The prefix "con-" indicates "together," and the root "-solari" relates to the idea of "soothing" or "alleviating."  Therefore, the original meaning points to the act of bringing comfort together or jointly.
