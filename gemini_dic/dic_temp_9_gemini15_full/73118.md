词源:

The phrase "for sure" is a relatively modern colloquialism.  "For" in this context functions as a preposition indicating purpose or reason,  similar to its use in phrases like "for certain" or "for good." "Sure" originates from the Old French "seur" meaning "safe," "secure," or "certain."  Over time, "sure" evolved to its modern meaning of certain or definite. The combination "for sure" emphasizes the certainty.  There's no single historical event marking its origin; it emerged gradually through common usage.
