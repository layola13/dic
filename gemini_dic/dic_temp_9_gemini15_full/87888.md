The word "hien" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Please double-check your spelling.
2. **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name (person, place, or thing) or a brand name.
3. **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word from a different language, perhaps with a similar pronunciation to an English word.  If you can provide the language of origin, it might be possible to provide a translation and explanation.
4. **It's a neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or slang term not yet widely recognized.
