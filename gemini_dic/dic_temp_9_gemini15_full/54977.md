词源:  The word is derived from the adjective "disproportionate," which itself is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of"), "proportion," and the suffix "-ate" (forming adjectives). "Proportion" comes from the Old French "proportion" and ultimately from the Latin "proportio," meaning "due share, symmetry."
