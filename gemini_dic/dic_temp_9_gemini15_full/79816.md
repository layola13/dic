词源:
The name "glycoluril" is derived from its chemical structure:

* **Glyco-**:  This prefix refers to a sugar or sugar-like structure. While glycoluril doesn't directly contain a sugar, the cyclic structure bears some resemblance to certain sugar derivatives.

* **-uril**: This suffix is commonly found in heterocyclic compounds containing urea or related moieties.  Urea itself is a key component in the synthesis of glycoluril.

Therefore, the name suggests a compound with a cyclic structure related to urea and having some sugar-like characteristics in its chemical behavior.
