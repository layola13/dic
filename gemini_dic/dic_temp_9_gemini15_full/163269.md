词源:
The word "preconcurred" is formed from the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the verb "concur" (meaning "to agree").  Therefore, it literally means "to agree beforehand".  "Concur" itself comes from the Latin "concurrere," meaning "to run together," implying agreement or convergence of opinions.
