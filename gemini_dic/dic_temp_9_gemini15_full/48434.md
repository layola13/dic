词源:
The word "deductible" comes from the verb "deduct," meaning to subtract or take away.  The "-ible" suffix indicates something capable of being done. Therefore, a "deductible" is an amount that can be deducted from a larger sum (like a total medical bill) before the insurance company pays its share.  The root is the Latin word *deducere*, meaning "to lead away, withdraw".
