词源:  The word "prewashing" is a compound word.  "Pre-" is a prefix meaning "before" or "in advance of," derived from Latin "prae," meaning "before." "Washing" is the gerund form of the verb "to wash," ultimately derived from Old English "wascan."  Therefore, prewashing literally means "washing before."
