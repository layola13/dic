The word "footiest" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a non-standard or informal word, possibly a misspelling, a newly coined word, or slang specific to a certain region or group.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide an answer adhering to the requested format, we'd need more context on where you encountered this word.

If you can provide the context (sentence, paragraph, source), I can speculate on its possible meaning and attempt a partial analysis based on context.  For example, it might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could it be a misspelling of a similar-sounding word?  (e.g., "footsie,"  "foolish," etc.)
* **A combination of words:**  Could it be a combination of "foot" and another word, resulting in a novel slang term?
* **Regional slang:**  Is this word used in a specific region or community?  Knowing the origin would help understand its meaning.


Without further information, I cannot provide the requested analysis according to the format.
