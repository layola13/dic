logarithmic:/ˌlɒɡəˈrɪðmɪk/ /ˌlɔːɡəˈrɪðmɪk/| adj.| 对数的，对数的；成比例的 | Relating to or involving logarithms.  Logarithms are the inverse of exponentiation.  A logarithmic scale is one where equal intervals correspond to equal ratios, rather than equal differences. | The Richter scale is a logarithmic scale used to measure the magnitude of earthquakes.  |近义词：exponential (in the context of inverse relationship)| 反义词：linear|  形容词

词源:

The word "logarithmic" is derived from the word "logarithm," which itself comes from the Greek words *logos* (λόγος), meaning "ratio," "proportion," or "word," and *arithmos* (ἀριθμός), meaning "number."  The term was coined by John Napier in the early 17th century to describe a system of calculations that simplified complex multiplications and divisions into simpler additions and subtractions.
