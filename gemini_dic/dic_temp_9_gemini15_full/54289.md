词源:
disgusted comes from the verb "disgust," which itself comes from the Old French word "desgouster," meaning "to spoil the taste of."  The prefix "dis-" indicates negation or reversal, implying a spoiling or upsetting of one's sense of taste or sensibilities.  The evolution reflects a shift from a literal sense of bad taste to a broader figurative sense of strong disapproval and revulsion.
