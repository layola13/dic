词源:
The word "foxtrot" is a dance named after the World War I-era British military officer Harry Fox.  The dance itself was created by combining elements of other dances.  The "-ing" suffix creates the present participle, indicating the action of doing the foxtrot or moving quickly in a similar manner.
