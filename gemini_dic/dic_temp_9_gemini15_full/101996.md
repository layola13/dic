isocitrate:/ˌaɪsoʊˈsaɪtreɪt/| n. |异柠檬酸酯|Isocitrate is a six-carbon tricarboxylic acid that is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or TCA cycle).  It is formed from citrate by the enzyme aconitase and is subsequently oxidized to α-ketoglutarate. |The citric acid cycle is crucial for cellular respiration and energy production. Isocitrate dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of isocitrate.|  Isocitrate is a key intermediate in energy metabolism. |近义词: citrate (related compound)|反义词:  None directly, but α-ketoglutarate is the product of its oxidation in the citric acid cycle.
