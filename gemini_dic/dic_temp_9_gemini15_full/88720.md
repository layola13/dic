The word "hobiler" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific dialect or jargon, or a proper noun.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis.
