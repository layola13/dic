词源:

The word is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "sobering," which means causing one to become serious or thoughtful.  Therefore, "nonsobering" means "not causing seriousness or thoughtfulness."  The root of "sober" traces back to Old English "sober," possibly related to Old Norse and Old High German words suggesting steadiness or seriousness.
