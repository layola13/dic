microdiorite:/ˌmaɪkroʊˈdaɪəraɪt/| n. |微辉绿岩|A fine-grained igneous rock, intermediate in composition between andesite and diorite.  It is characterized by its small crystal size, typically less than 1 millimeter in diameter. Microdiorite is often dark-colored and may contain various minerals such as plagioclase feldspar, hornblende, and biotite.|Example: The geologist identified the sample as a microdiorite based on its mineral composition and fine grain size.  地质学家根据其矿物成分和细粒度将样品鉴定为微辉绿岩。|近义词：Diorite, Andesite (depending on composition)|反义词：Pegmatite (coarse-grained)|名词
