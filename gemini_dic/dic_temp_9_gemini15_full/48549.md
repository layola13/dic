词源:  The word "defalcator" comes from the verb "defalcate," which itself originates from the Late Latin word "defalcare," meaning "to cut off," "to deduct," or "to strike out."  This eventually evolved to mean to be deficient or to embezzle.  The "-ator" suffix signifies an agent or doer of the action.
