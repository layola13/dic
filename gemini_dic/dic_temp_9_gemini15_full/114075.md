magnetomotor: /ˌmæɡnɪˈtoʊmoʊtər/ | n. | 磁电机 | A magnetomotor is a type of electric motor that uses magnetic fields to produce rotational motion.  It typically consists of a stator (stationary part) and a rotor (rotating part), interacting magnetic fields create torque, causing the rotor to spin.  Unlike traditional electric motors which rely on electromagnets, magnetomotors can utilize permanent magnets in either the stator or rotor or both, simplifying the design and potentially improving efficiency.  However, magnetomotors are often less powerful than their electromagnet counterparts. | Example:  The experimental drone used a novel magnetomotor for its propulsion system.  该实验型无人机使用了一种新型磁电机作为其推进系统。 | 近义词:  electric motor, rotary motor | 反义词:  (no direct antonym, but could be contrasted with motors using different principles like hydraulic motors)
