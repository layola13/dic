词源:
The word "self-panegyric" is a compound word.

* **self-**:  A prefix meaning "of or relating to oneself."  Its origins are in Old English *self, *sylf.

* **panegyric**:  This is the core element. It comes from the Late Latin *panegyricus, derived from the Greek *panegyrikos, meaning "of or pertaining to a panegyric" or "festive assembly."  The Greek word is composed of *pan- ("all," "entire") and *agōr ("assembly," "marketplace").  Originally, a panegyric referred to a formal speech of praise delivered at a public gathering.

Therefore, "self-panegyric" literally means "self-praise delivered at a (possibly self-imagined) assembly" or simply "self-praise."
