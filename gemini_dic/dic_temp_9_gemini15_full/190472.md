近义词：cheek, impudence, impertinence, boldness, audacity, spirit, spunk

反义词：submissiveness, meekness, timidity, politeness


词源:  Derived from "sassy," which ultimately comes from the obsolete word "sauce," meaning "impudence" or "boldness."  This "sauce" is related to the French word "sauce," meaning "sauce" (in the culinary sense), but its figurative meaning of impudence developed independently in English.  The "-iness" suffix turns the adjective "sassy" into a noun, signifying a quality or state.
