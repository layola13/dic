词源:
episodic (adj.) + -ally (adv. suffix)

episodic comes from episode (n.), ultimately from Greek *episōdion "a happening in a story," from epi- "upon, among" + -ōdion, neuter of -ōdēs "having the nature of," from -ōde "song, ode."  The sense evolution is from a single incident in a narrative to a recurring incident in a larger context.
