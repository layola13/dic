词源:
The word "lamenter" is derived from the verb "lament," which comes from the Old French word "lamenter," meaning "to weep, bewail."  The Old French word, in turn, originates from the Latin word "lamentare," which has the same meaning.  The suffix "-er" is an agent noun suffix indicating a person who performs the action.
