The word "drazel" is not found in standard English dictionaries or common usage.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word), a misspelling, a proper noun (a name, place, etc.), or a word from a niche dialect or fictional context.  To provide a proper analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (Book, game, conversation, etc.)
* **What was the surrounding text or situation?**  This would help to determine the intended meaning and usage.

Without this information, I cannot provide the requested format.
