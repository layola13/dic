gymnophthalmata: /ˌdʒɪmˌnɒfθælˈmɑːtə/ | n. | 眼睑蜥蜴科 |  Gymnophthalmata is a family of lizards characterized by their generally small size, slender bodies, and often reduced or absent eyelids. They are found primarily in the Americas, with a high diversity in South America. The family is taxonomically complex, and the classification and relationships between its members are still being actively investigated.  Many species exhibit fossorial (burrowing) behaviors. | Example:  The genus *Bachia* is a well-known example of a limbless gymnophthalmid lizard. 眼睑蜥蜴科的一个著名例子是*Bachia*属的无肢蜥蜴。  | 近义词: (none directly equivalent, needs to be specified by a particular genus or species within the family) | 反义词: (none directly applicable) |  名词
