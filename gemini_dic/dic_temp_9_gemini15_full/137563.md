PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "nontransmission".  The usage is quite technical and straightforward.  Phrases would revolve around the *lack* of transmission in various contexts. For example:


lack of nontransmission: (This is redundant and incorrect usage.  It should simply be "transmission".)
periods of nontransmission:  非传输时期
reasons for nontransmission:  非传输的原因
risk of nontransmission: (again, redundant, it would be better phrased "risk of *failure to* transmit")
