词源:

The phrase combines the verb "make" (meaning to create, utilize, or cause something to happen) with the superlative adjective "most" (meaning the greatest amount or degree) and the preposition "of" (indicating the source or object of the action).  The meaning evolved from the sense of extracting the greatest possible value or benefit from something.
