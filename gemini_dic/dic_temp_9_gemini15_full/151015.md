词源:

The word "paranoid" comes from the Greek word "παράνοια" (paranoia), which literally means "madness beside oneself" or "abnormal mental state".  It entered English in the late 19th century, originally as a medical term to describe a specific type of mental illness characterized by delusions of persecution and grandeur.  Its modern usage has broadened to include informal descriptions of excessive suspicion and distrust.
