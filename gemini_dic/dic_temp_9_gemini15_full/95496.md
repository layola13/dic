WORD ORIGIN->
The word "inclementnesses" is derived from the adjective "inclement," which comes from the Latin word "inclementus."  "In-" is a negative prefix, while "clemens" means "mild" or "gentle." Therefore, "inclement" literally means "not mild" or "unmerciful." The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality.  The plural "-es" indicates multiple instances of inclement weather or harsh conditions.
