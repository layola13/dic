semihyperbolic: /ˌsɛmihaɪpərˈbɒlɪk/ | adj. | 半双曲线的；部分双曲线的 |  Describing a geometric object or system that exhibits some, but not all, of the properties of a hyperbolic object or system.  It often implies a transitional or intermediate state between hyperbolic and other geometric types (like elliptic or parabolic). The precise meaning depends heavily on the context (e.g., in mathematics, physics, or even descriptive language).| The model exhibited semihyperbolic behavior under certain conditions.  这个模型在特定条件下表现出半双曲线的行为。| 近义词: partially hyperbolic, quasi-hyperbolic (depending on context) | 反义词: hyperbolic, elliptic, parabolic


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in technical contexts, particularly in mathematics and physics, and therefore doesn't lend itself to the standard grammatical tense examples like the example word "what".  Instead, here are example sentences demonstrating its usage in different contexts:


Example 1 (Mathematics):

The map demonstrates semihyperbolic behavior near the singularity.  该映射在奇点附近表现出半双曲线的行为。


Example 2 (Physics):

Under high energy conditions, the particle interactions show a semihyperbolic trajectory. 在高能条件下，粒子相互作用显示出半双曲线的轨迹。


Example 3 (Descriptive, less precise):

His emotional response was semihyperbolic—a mixture of intense passion and controlled restraint. 他的情绪反应是半双曲线的——强烈激情和克制控制的混合体。
