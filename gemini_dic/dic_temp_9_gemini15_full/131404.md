近义词： unconventional, unorthodox, avant-garde, modern, experimental

反义词：classical, traditional, conventional, orthodox


词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "classical," which derives from the Latin word "classicus" (meaning "of the first rank," "belonging to the highest class").  Thus, "nonclassical" literally means "not of the highest class" in the context of artistic styles and traditions.
