词源:
The word "resurveying" is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the word "surveying."  "Surveying" itself originates from the Old French word "surveier," which comes from the Old French "sur-" (over, upon) + "veoir" (to see).  Thus, the core meaning of "surveying" is to look over or examine something carefully. The addition of "re-" emphasizes the repetition of the action.
