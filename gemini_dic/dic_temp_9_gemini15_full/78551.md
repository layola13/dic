词源:
The word "ghost" comes from the Old English word "gast," meaning "spirit," "breath," or "soul."  This word is related to the German "Geist" (spirit) and the Dutch "geest" (spirit, mind).  The modern English meaning of "ghost" evolved from its earlier usage referring to a disembodied spirit, often associated with the dead.
