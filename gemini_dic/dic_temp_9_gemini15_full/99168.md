/ɪntərˈtʃoʊks/ | n. | 互扼, 互相阻碍 |  The word "interchoke" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It seems to be a newly coined or very rarely used word, likely formed by combining "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and "choke" (meaning to obstruct or suppress).  Therefore, a comprehensive analysis based on established linguistic resources is impossible.  A likely meaning, based on the component parts, would be a situation where multiple things mutually obstruct or suppress each other. | Example:  The two competing technologies interchoked each other's development, resulting in a stalemate. (假设例句) | 近义词: mutual obstruction, reciprocal hindrance, deadlock | 反义词: mutual support, collaboration, synergy |  n.


USAGE->
This word lacks established usage in standard English grammar, so providing examples in different tenses is not feasible.


PHRASE->
