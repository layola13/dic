The word "mortling" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very niche context (e.g., a fantasy novel, a specific dialect).  To provide an analysis, more information is needed about its source and intended meaning.
