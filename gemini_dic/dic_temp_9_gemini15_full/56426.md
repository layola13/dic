词源:

The word "dollhouse" is a compound word formed from "doll" and "house".

"Doll" originates from the Middle Dutch word "dol," meaning "child's toy" or "puppet".  It evolved through Middle English and eventually to the modern English "doll".

"House" has Germanic origins, tracing back to Proto-Germanic *hūsiz, meaning "house".  Its development is well-documented through Old English and Middle English.

Therefore, "dollhouse" literally means a "house for dolls".  Its meaning has remained consistent throughout its history, referring to a small-scale model house for play.
