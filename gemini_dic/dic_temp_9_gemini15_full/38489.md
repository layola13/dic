conchometry:/ˌkɒŋkəˈmɛtri/ | n. | 贝壳测量学 | The scientific study of the measurements and proportions of shells, particularly those of mollusks.  It involves analyzing shell shape, size, and other morphological features to understand species identification, evolutionary relationships, and environmental influences. | Example: Conchometry is a valuable tool in paleontology for identifying fossil mollusks. 贝壳测量学是古生物学中识别化石软体动物的宝贵工具。 |近义词:shell measurement, malacology (broader field) |反义词:None
