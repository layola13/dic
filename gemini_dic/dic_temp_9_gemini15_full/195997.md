词源:

The word comes from the noun "sentiment" + the suffix "-alised" (British English spelling; American English spelling is "-alized"). "Sentiment" ultimately derives from the Latin word "sentire," meaning "to feel."  The suffix "-alised/-alized" indicates the process of making something or becoming something.  Therefore, "sentimentalised" describes something or someone that has been made or has become excessively sentimental.
