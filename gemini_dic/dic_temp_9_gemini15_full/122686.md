The word "moebles" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

* **A misspelling:** Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "muebles" (Spanish for furniture), "mobiles" (meaning moving objects or cell phones), or another word entirely.
* **A neologism:** A newly coined word not yet widely accepted.
* **A proper noun:** A name or brand that is not commonly known.
* **A regional dialect word:** A word used in a specific geographic area.


Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible without further clarification on the intended word.  Please provide the correct spelling or more context.
