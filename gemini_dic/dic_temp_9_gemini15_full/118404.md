merozoite:/ˈmɛroʊzoʊaɪt/| n. |裂殖子|A merozoite is a stage in the life cycle of apicomplexan parasites, such as Plasmodium (which causes malaria), that results from the asexual reproduction of a trophozoite within a host cell.  It is a small, uninucleate cell that is released from the host cell to infect new cells and continue the parasitic cycle. | Example:  The merozoites, released from the ruptured red blood cell, invaded new erythrocytes, causing a new cycle of malaria infection.  裂殖子从破裂的红细胞中释放出来，侵入新的红细胞，导致新的疟疾感染周期。|近义词： sporozoite (though at a different stage of the life cycle)|反义词： N/A


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Merozoites invade red blood cells. = 裂殖子侵入红细胞。
The parasite releases merozoites. = 寄生虫释放裂殖子。


一般过去时:
The merozoites invaded the liver cells. = 裂殖子侵入了肝细胞。
Scientists observed the merozoites under a microscope. = 科学家在显微镜下观察了裂殖子。


现在完成时:
The merozoites have already infected many cells. = 裂殖子已经感染了许多细胞。
Researchers have identified several proteins on the surface of merozoites. = 研究人员已经确定了裂殖子表面几种蛋白质。


过去完成时:
The merozoites had already replicated before the treatment began. = 在治疗开始之前，裂殖子已经复制了。
The patient's immune system had already begun to fight off the merozoites.  = 病人的免疫系统已经开始对抗裂殖子。


将来时:
The merozoites will continue to multiply. = 裂殖子将继续增殖。
The drug will target the merozoites to prevent further infection. = 该药物将靶向裂殖子以防止进一步感染。


虚拟语气:
If the merozoites were destroyed earlier, the infection would have been less severe. = 如果裂殖子被更早地摧毁，感染就会不那么严重。
It is crucial that merozoite development be inhibited.  = 抑制裂殖子的发育至关重要。


被动语态:
Merozoites are released into the bloodstream. = 裂殖子被释放到血液中。
The merozoites were observed using advanced microscopy techniques.  = 使用先进的显微镜技术观察了裂殖子。


疑问句:
How many merozoites are produced by each trophozoite? = 每个滋养体产生多少裂殖子？
Where do the merozoites invade? = 裂殖子侵入哪里？


否定句:
The drug did not completely eliminate the merozoites. = 该药物并没有完全消除裂殖子。
The researchers did not observe any merozoites in the control group. = 研究人员在对照组中没有观察到任何裂殖子。


PHRASE->
merozoite invasion = 裂殖子入侵
merozoite development = 裂殖子发育
merozoite surface proteins = 裂殖子表面蛋白
merozoite antigens = 裂殖子抗原
merozoite lifecycle = 裂殖子生命周期
