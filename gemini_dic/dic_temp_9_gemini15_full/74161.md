词源:
The word "fountain" refers to a source of water, and in this context, it refers to the continuous flow of ink from the pen's reservoir.  "Pen" is from the Latin word "penna," meaning "feather," as early writing implements were made from bird feathers.  Thus, "fountain pen" describes a pen that provides a continuous flow of ink, unlike dip pens that require frequent dipping.
