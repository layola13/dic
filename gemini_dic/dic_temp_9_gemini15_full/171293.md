ptilopteri: /ˌtɪloʊˈptɛri/ | n. | 羽毛状的，有羽毛的 |  The word "ptilopteri" refers to something having feather-like structures or appendages.  It is primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly in zoology and paleontology, to describe features of certain organisms, often relating to their wings or other body parts.  The term is derived from Greek roots: "ptilon" (πῖλον) meaning "feather" and "pteron" (πτερόν) meaning "wing" or "feather".  Therefore, it literally translates to "feather-winged" or "feathery-winged". There are no common synonyms or antonyms as it's a highly specific scientific term.
