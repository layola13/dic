词源:
The word "joinery" comes from the Old French "joinurie," a diminutive of "joint," meaning "a joint" or "a connection."  The suffix "-ery" indicates a place, activity, or collection of things. Thus, "joinery" originally meant the place where joints were made, later evolving to describe the craft itself and the resulting pieces.
