self-impregnators: /ˌsɛlf ɪmˈprɛɡneɪtərz/ | n. | 自我受精者；自体受精生物 | Organisms capable of self-fertilization.  This term is primarily used in biology and refers to organisms, usually plants or hermaphroditic animals, that can fertilize their own eggs or ovules without needing a partner.  | Example: Some species of plants are self-impregnators, ensuring reproduction even in isolation.  一些植物物种是自我受精的，即使在隔离状态下也能确保繁殖。 | 近义词: self-fertilizers, hermaphrodites (in the context of self-fertilization) | 反义词: cross-pollinators, outcrossers


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Self-impregnators reproduce without a partner. = 自我受精者无需伴侣即可繁殖。
These plants are self-impregnators. = 这些植物是自我受精的。


一般过去时:

They had already identified several self-impregnators in the region. = 他们已经在该地区发现了几个自我受精者。


将来时:
Researchers will continue to study self-impregnators. = 研究人员将继续研究自我受精者。
We will learn more about the genetic consequences of self-impregnation in self-impregnators. = 我们将学习更多关于自我受精者自我受精的遗传后果。


虚拟语气:
If they were self-impregnators, they would survive easily in isolation. = 如果它们是自我受精者，它们就能很容易地在隔离状态下生存。

被动语态:
Self-impregnators were observed in the field study. = 在实地研究中观察到了自我受精者。
Many aspects of self-impregnation in self-impregnators are still being studied. = 自我受精者自我受精的许多方面仍在研究中。


疑问句:
Are all hermaphrodites self-impregnators? = 所有雌雄同体的生物都是自我受精者吗？

否定句:
Not all plants are self-impregnators. = 并非所有植物都是自我受精的。
This species is not a self-impregnator; it requires cross-pollination. = 这个物种不是自我受精的；它需要异花授粉。
