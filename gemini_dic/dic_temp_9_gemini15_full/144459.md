词源:  The word "outtake" is a compound word formed from "out" and "take."  "Take" in this context refers to a single shot or recording.  "Out" indicates that something has been left out or excluded.  Therefore, an outtake is something that was filmed or recorded but ultimately omitted from the final product.
