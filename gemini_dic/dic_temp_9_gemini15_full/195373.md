semimechanistic:/ˌsɛmiˈmɛkəˈnɪstɪk/ | adj. | 半机械的；部分机械的 | Partially mechanistic; exhibiting characteristics of both mechanistic and non-mechanistic processes.  It describes a system or process that combines mechanistic (deterministic, predictable) and non-mechanistic (stochastic, unpredictable) elements.  | The model presented a semimechanistic view of the disease's progression, acknowledging both genetic predispositions and environmental factors.  | mechanistic, deterministic | holistic, organic, probabilistic | 形容词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The model presents a semimechanistic view. = 模型呈现了一种半机械的观点。
This system operates semimechanistically. = 这个系统以半机械的方式运行。

一般过去时:
Scientists considered the process semimechanistic. = 科学家认为这个过程是半机械的。
The study demonstrated a semimechanistic effect. = 该研究证明了一种半机械效应。

现在完成时:
Researchers have developed a semimechanistic theory. = 研究人员已经开发出一个半机械理论。
The experiment has shown semimechanistic behavior. = 实验显示了半机械行为。

过去完成时:
They had already established a semimechanistic framework. = 他们已经建立了一个半机械框架。
The analysis had revealed a semimechanistic pattern. = 分析揭示了一种半机械模式。

将来时:
We will explore a more semimechanistic approach. = 我们将探索一种更具半机械性的方法。
Future research will likely adopt a semimechanistic model. = 未来的研究可能会采用半机械模型。

虚拟语气:
If the system were purely semimechanistic, we would observe X. = 如果系统完全是半机械的，我们将观察到X。
It is as if the process were completely semimechanistic. = 就好像这个过程完全是半机械的一样。

被动语态:
The phenomenon is described as semimechanistic. = 这种现象被描述为半机械的。
A semimechanistic explanation was proposed. = 提出了一个半机械的解释。

疑问句:
Is the model truly semimechanistic? = 该模型真的是半机械的吗？
Are there any semimechanistic components in this system? = 这个系统中是否有任何半机械组件？

否定句:
The process is not entirely semimechanistic. = 这个过程并非完全是半机械的。
The results do not support a purely semimechanistic interpretation. = 结果不支持纯粹的半机械解释。


PHRASE->
There is no common phrase directly using "semimechanistic".  The word itself is used primarily as an adjective to describe models, theories, processes, or systems.  Therefore, phrases would be created based on the context, such as:

semimechanistic model  半机械模型
semimechanistic approach 半机械方法
semimechanistic interpretation 半机械解释
semimechanistic system 半机械系统
semimechanistic perspective 半机械视角
