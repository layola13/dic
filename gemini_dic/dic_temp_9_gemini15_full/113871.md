词源:  The word "madling" appears to be a relatively recent and informal coinage. It combines the adjective "mad" (meaning insane or furious) with a suffix "-ling," which often suggests something small or insignificant. However, in this case, the "-ling" likely serves to intensify the meaning of "mad," creating a more forceful and descriptive term for wild, uncontrolled behavior.  There's no established etymological record tracing it back to older words or roots.
