词源:

The word is a compound adjective formed by combining "low" (meaning small in amount or degree) and "maintenance" (the act of keeping something in good condition). "Maintenance" itself originates from the Old French word "mainteinement," derived from the verb "maintenir," meaning "to maintain," which further traces back to the Latin word "manutēnēre," meaning "to keep in hand."
