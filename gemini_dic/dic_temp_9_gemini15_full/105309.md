kibibyte:/ˈkaɪbɪbaɪt/| n. |千字节（KiB）|A kibibyte (KiB) is a unit of information or computer storage equal to 1,024 bytes.  It's based on powers of 2, unlike the kilobyte (kB), which is sometimes mistakenly used interchangeably and is based on powers of 10 (1,000 bytes).  The term "kibi" is a prefix derived from "kilo" and binary, clarifying the difference. |The file size is 2 KiB.  这个文件大小是2 KiB。|近义词：kilobyte (kB) (often used incorrectly as a synonym)|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
This file occupies 10 KiB. = 这个文件占用10 KiB。
How many KiB does this program use? = 这个程序使用多少 KiB？


一般过去时:
The old system only supported files up to 1024 KiB. = 旧系统只支持最大1024 KiB的文件。
The download took 5 minutes and used 200 KiB of data. = 下载花了5分钟，使用了200 KiB的数据。


现在完成时:
We have transferred over 1 GiB of data, which is equivalent to many thousands of KiB. = 我们已经传输了超过1 GiB的数据，相当于数千个KiB。
The program has already consumed 50 KiB of memory. = 程序已经消耗了50 KiB的内存。


过去完成时:
Before the update, the application had only used 10 KiB of memory. = 更新之前，应用程序只使用了10 KiB的内存。
The system had already processed thousands of KiB of data before the crash. = 系统在崩溃之前已经处理了数千KiB的数据。


将来时:
This file will likely be around 100 KiB once compressed. = 压缩后，这个文件大概会有100 KiB。
The new software will require at least 500 KiB of free space. = 新软件至少需要500 KiB的可用空间。


虚拟语气:
If the file were only 1 KiB, it would upload instantly. = 如果文件只有1 KiB，它会立即上传。
I wish the image size was less than 10 KiB. = 我希望图像大小小于10 KiB。


被动语态:
The data was compressed to a size of 5 KiB. = 数据被压缩到5 KiB。
A total of 100 KiB of memory is being used by the browser. = 浏览器正在使用总共100 KiB的内存。


疑问句:
How many KiB are allocated to this process? = 分配给此进程多少 KiB？
What is the size of this file in KiB? = 这个文件的大小是多少KiB？


否定句:
The system doesn't have enough memory to process files larger than 100 KiB. = 系统没有足够的内存来处理大于100 KiB的文件。
The image wasn't optimized and therefore was larger than 20 KiB. = 图片没有被优化，因此大于20 KiB。


PHRASE->
KiB of data = 千字节的数据
allocate KiB = 分配千字节
consume KiB = 消耗千字节
transfer KiB = 传输千字节
free up KiB = 释放千字节
