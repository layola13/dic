geosphere:/ˈdʒiːoʊsfɪr/| n. |地球圈，岩石圈|The geosphere is the solid, rocky part of the Earth.  It includes the crust, mantle, and core.  The geosphere interacts with the other Earth systems (atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere) in complex ways.|例句：The movement of tectonic plates within the geosphere causes earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.  地球圈内构造板块的运动会导致地震和火山爆发。|近义词：lithosphere|反义词：atmosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere|名词
