词源:
The word "peasantess" is derived from the Old French word "paisant," meaning "country dweller," which in turn comes from the Latin word "paganus," meaning "countryman" or "villager."  The suffix "-ess" is a feminine suffix added to nouns to indicate the female gender.  Therefore, "peasantess" literally means "female peasant."
