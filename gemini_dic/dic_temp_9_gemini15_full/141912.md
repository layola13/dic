USAGE->
This word is primarily used in academic and technical contexts, particularly in discussions of set theory, logic, and algorithm design.  Therefore, grammatical examples in various tenses are less relevant than an understanding of its conceptual application.  The usage focuses on describing the inherent property of a set or collection.

Example 1:  The high ordinability of the data facilitated efficient sorting algorithms. 数据的高度可排序性促进了高效的排序算法。

Example 2:  We examined the ordinability of different types of linguistic structures. 我们考察了不同类型语言结构的可排序性。


PHRASE->
This word doesn't typically appear in common phrases.  Phrases would be built around the concept, rather than including the word itself directly.  For example:

* **The problem of ordinability:** This refers to challenges encountered when trying to establish an ordering.
* **Degree of ordinability:** This indicates how easily a set can be ordered.
* **Methods for establishing ordinability:** This points to techniques used to determine if ordering is possible.
* **Implications of ordinability:** This discusses the consequences of a set's orderability.
* **Lack of ordinability:** This describes situations where ordering isn't possible.


WORD ORIGIN->

The word "ordinability" is derived from the adjective "ordinable," which in turn comes from the verb "to ordain."  "Ordain" originally meant "to establish by order or decree," and has roots in Old French ("ordener") and ultimately Latin ("ordinare").  The suffix "-ability" indicates the capacity or potential for something.  Therefore, "ordinability" signifies the capacity or potential to be ordered or arranged.
