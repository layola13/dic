phycochrome:/ˈfaɪkoʊkroʊm/ | n. |藻胆色素|A light-sensitive pigment found in cyanobacteria and some algae that is involved in regulating various physiological processes, such as photosynthesis and photomorphogenesis.  Phycochromes are bilin-containing proteins that undergo reversible photoisomerization upon light absorption, changing their absorption spectra and triggering downstream signaling pathways. | Example: The phycochrome system allows cyanobacteria to adapt to changes in light intensity and quality. 藻胆色素系统使蓝细菌能够适应光强度和质量的变化。 |近义词:  photosynthetic pigment (光合色素) |反义词: None specifically, but terms indicating its absence or inactivity could be considered antonyms (e.g.,  phycochrome-deficient)
