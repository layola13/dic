词源:
The word "restorer" comes from the verb "restore," which is derived from the Old French word "restores," meaning "to restore, reinstate, rebuild."  The prefix "re-" means "again" and the root "-store" relates to the Latin word "stare," meaning "to stand."  Thus, "restore" literally means "to set up again," implying a return to a previous state.  The suffix "-er" is an agent noun suffix, indicating a person who performs the action.
