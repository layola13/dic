词源:
The word "compromising" is derived from the verb "compromise," which itself comes from the Old French word "compromis," meaning "agreement, settlement, arbitration."  This in turn derives from the Latin "compromissum," a past participle of "compromittere," meaning "to promise together," "to submit to arbitration." The modern sense of "to compromise" encompassing both "to reach an agreement" and "to endanger" developed over time.
