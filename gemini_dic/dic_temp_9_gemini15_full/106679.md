词源:
The word "kvetches" is a Yiddish word derived from the verb "kvetshn," meaning "to squeeze, press, or crush."  In its metaphorical use in Yiddish, it came to mean to complain or whine persistently.  It has been adopted into English, particularly in informal contexts, to describe persistent, often petty complaining.
