The word "koo" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word?  Please double-check your spelling.
* **A slang term or regionalism:** It could be an informal word used in a specific community or region, but without more context, it's impossible to define.
* **An onomatopoeia:** It might be a word imitating a sound, like the sound of a bird or a machine.  Again, context is needed.
* **A proper noun:** It could be a name, place, or brand.

To provide a detailed analysis like the example, I need the correct spelling or more information about its context (where you heard/saw it).
