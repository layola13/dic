词源:

The word is derived from "highbrow," which itself is a compound of "high" (meaning elevated, superior) and "brow" (referring to the forehead, often associated with intellect).  The "-ish" suffix adds a slightly diminishing or less intense connotation, suggesting a tendency towards or an approximation of highbrowness, rather than a complete embodiment of it.  Thus, "high-browish" implies a somewhat artificial or affected display of intellectualism or sophistication.
