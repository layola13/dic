词源:
The word "self-entertainment" is a compound word.  "Self" is a prefix indicating that the action is performed by oneself. "Entertainment" derives from the Old French "entretenir," meaning "to keep up, maintain," which itself comes from "entre" (between) and "tenir" (to hold).  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the act of providing amusement or diversion.  Therefore, "self-entertainment" literally means "the act of keeping oneself amused or occupied."
