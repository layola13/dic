rennets:/ˈrɛnɪts/| n.|凝乳酶；凝乳酵素|A rennet is a complex of enzymes produced in the stomachs of some animals, primarily ruminants such as calves, lambs, and kids, used to coagulate milk in cheesemaking.  It is also used in some other food processing applications. | Example:  Traditional cheesemaking relies on animal rennet for curdling the milk. 传统奶酪制作依靠动物凝乳酶使牛奶凝固。  The use of vegetable rennet is becoming increasingly common. 植物凝乳酶的使用越来越普遍。|近义词：chymosin, coagulant|反义词：无

词源:
The word "rennet" comes from the Old French word "renet," which means "kidney."  This is because traditionally, rennet was extracted from the fourth stomach of young ruminants (calves, lambs, etc.), a part of the digestive system sometimes referred to as the abomasum.  The connection to the kidney is likely due to the proximity of the abomasum to the kidneys in the animal's anatomy.
