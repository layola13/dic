词源:  "gotten" is the past participle of the verb "get," which has Old English roots ( *getian,  meaning "to get, obtain").  "Through" is also of Old English origin (þurh), meaning "by way of, by means of." Thus, "gotten through" combines the sense of having successfully passed or completed something.  Note that "gotten" is primarily used in American English; British English typically uses "got."
