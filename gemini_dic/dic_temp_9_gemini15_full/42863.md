词源:
The word "courtesy" comes from the Old French word "curtesie," meaning "courtly behavior," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "curia," meaning "court."  Originally, courtesies referred to the polite manners and behavior expected within a royal court. Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass polite behavior in general.
