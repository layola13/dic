词源:
The word "extravaganza" comes from Italian "extravagante," meaning "out of bounds," "extravagant," or "wandering beyond the limits."  It entered English in the 19th century, initially referring to a type of operatic spectacle, then broadening to encompass any large-scale, lavish, and often ostentatious event.
