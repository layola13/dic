词源:
The word "lunge" ultimately derives from the Old French word "longe," meaning "a long, narrow strip of leather," or "a leash."  This refers to the long, reaching movement associated with the action.  Over time, the meaning shifted to encompass the forceful, forward thrusting movement we associate with the word today.
