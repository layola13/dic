词源:
The word "muckrake" originates from John Bunyan's *Pilgrim's Progress*, where it refers to a man so focused on raking muck (filth) that he ignores more important matters.  President Theodore Roosevelt used the term in a speech to criticize journalists who focused excessively on minor scandals rather than larger issues.  The word's meaning has since evolved to encompass the exposing of scandals, regardless of the journalist's intent.
