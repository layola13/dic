pharmacodynamics:/ˌfɑːrməkəʊdaɪˈnæmɪks/| n. |药物动力学|The study of the biochemical and physiological effects of drugs and their mechanisms of action.  It examines what the drug does to the body.  This includes the drug's effect on the body, including its absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME), and how the drug interacts with receptors and other biological targets. |Example:  Understanding the pharmacodynamics of a drug is crucial for determining its efficacy and safety.  了解药物的药效动力学对于确定其疗效和安全性至关重要。|近义词：drug action, drug effect, pharmacologic action|反义词：pharmacokinetics (studies what the body does to the drug)|词性:名词
