词源:
The word "exhausted" comes from the past participle of the verb "exhaust," which itself originates from the Old French word "exhauster," meaning "to empty, drain." This in turn comes from the Latin word "exhaurire," composed of "ex-" (out) and "haurire" (to draw).  Therefore, "exhausted" literally means "drawn out" or "completely emptied."
