词源:

The word "inaccuracy" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the noun "accuracy."  "Accuracy" comes from the Old French "acuracie," ultimately deriving from the Latin "accuratus," meaning "carefully done" or "exact."  Therefore, "inaccuracy" literally means "not being carefully done" or "not being exact."
