hydrotropism:/ˌhaɪdroʊˈtroʊpɪzəm/| n. |向水性，亲水性 |The directional growth response of a plant to water.  Hydrotropism is a plant's ability to grow towards or away from a source of water. This is a crucial survival mechanism, ensuring the plant can access essential hydration. |Example: The roots of the plant exhibited strong hydrotropism, growing directly towards the underground water source. 植物的根系表现出强烈的向水性，直接生长到地下水源。 |近义词：hydrotaxis (less common)|反义词：None directly opposite, but negative hydrotropism could be considered the opposite.|名词
