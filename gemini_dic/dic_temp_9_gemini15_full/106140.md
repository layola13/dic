The word "knittle" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a detailed analysis following your requested format.  It's likely a misspelling, a dialect word, a neologism (newly coined word), or a proper noun.  To provide an analysis, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered this term.
