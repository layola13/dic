differentiabilities:/ˌdɪfərɛnʃiəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. |可微性，可导性 |The property of a function being differentiable.  It refers to the ability of a function to have a derivative at a point or over an interval.  This means the function is smooth and continuous enough to have a well-defined tangent line at each point. |The differentiabilities of this function are crucial for applying this theorem.  这个函数的可微性对于应用这个定理至关重要。|smoothness, continuity |non-differentiability |名词
