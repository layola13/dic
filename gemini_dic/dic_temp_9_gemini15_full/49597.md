词源:

The word "demesne" comes from Old French *demeine*,  meaning "domain, possession."  This ultimately derives from the Latin *dominium*, meaning "ownership, dominion, power."  The evolution reflects a shift from a purely legal concept of ownership to a broader understanding encompassing land and jurisdiction.
