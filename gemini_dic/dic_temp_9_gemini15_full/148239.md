The word "oversimplistic" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively"), the adjective "simplistic" (meaning "characterized by or given to simplification"), and the suffix "-istic" (forming adjectives).  "Simplistic" itself derives from "simple," ultimately from Latin *simplex ("single," "unfold").
