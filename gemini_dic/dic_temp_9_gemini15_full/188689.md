词源:

The word "run-down" originates from the phrasal verb "run down," which means to diminish, weaken, or deteriorate.  The noun form "run-down" then evolved to describe the state of being diminished or weakened, as well as a brief summary or account.  The "run" part comes from the sense of something being used or exhausted, and "down" indicates the direction of decline or completion.


用法说明:

1. **Summary or brief account:**  This is the most common usage.  A run-down provides a concise overview of a situation, event, or topic.

2. **State of disrepair or deterioration:** This refers to something that is in a poor condition due to neglect or age.  This can be applied to buildings, machines, or even a person's health.

3. **Concise review:** This usage is similar to the first, emphasizing brevity and clarity.
