词源:
The word "electro-optical" is a compound word formed from "electro-" (relating to electricity) and "-optical" (relating to light or optics).  "Electro-" is derived from the Greek word "elektron" (amber), which was known for its ability to attract light objects after being rubbed. "-Optical" comes from the Greek word "optikos" (relating to sight or vision).  Therefore, electro-optical literally means relating to the interaction between electricity and light.
