词源:
The word "overregulates" is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the verb "regulates," which comes from the Latin word "regulare" meaning "to make straight, rule, govern."  Therefore, "overregulates" literally means "to govern or control excessively."
