词源:
The word "relent" originates from the Old French word "relentir," meaning "to slacken, slow down."  This, in turn, comes from the Latin "re-," meaning "again," and "lenire," meaning "to soothe or soften."  The evolution reflects a shift from the literal meaning of slowing down to the figurative meaning of softening one's stance or attitude.
