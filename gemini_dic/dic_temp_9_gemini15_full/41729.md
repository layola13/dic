corrodibilities: /ˌkəˌroʊdəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 腐蚀性；易腐蚀性 | The susceptibility of a material to corrosion.  The property of being corrodible.  | 例句：The corrodibilities of different metals vary greatly depending on their composition and the environment.  不同金属的腐蚀性因其成分和环境而差异很大。

The high corrodibilities of these pipes necessitate frequent inspections. 这些管道的腐蚀性很高，需要经常检查。


近义词：susceptibility to corrosion, erodibility,  degradability | 反义词：corrosion resistance,  incorruptibility


词源:  Derived from "corrode" (to destroy or damage (a material) gradually by chemical action), ultimately from Latin "corrodere" (to gnaw). The suffix "-ibility" indicates capacity or capability.


USAGE->
This word is a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "to be," "to have," etc.  The grammatical structures used with it will depend on the context of the sentence.  Here are some examples showing its usage in different sentence structures.
