词源:
The word "resourced" is derived from the noun "resource," meaning a source of supply or support.  The suffix "-ed" transforms the noun into an adjective, describing something as possessing or characterized by resources.  The word's etymology traces back to Old French "ressource" (a re-source, a going back to a source), ultimately from the Latin "re-" (again) and "source" (source).
