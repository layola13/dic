USAGE->

一般现在时:
The crystals grow lamellarly. = 晶体层状生长。
Water flows lamellarly in this specific channel. = 水在这种特定通道中层流。

一般过去时:
The rock fractured lamellarly. = 岩石呈层状断裂。
The material separated lamellarly during the experiment. = 材料在实验过程中呈层状分离。

现在完成时:
The geologists have observed lamellar growth in many minerals. = 地质学家们已经在许多矿物中观察到层状生长。
The researchers have determined that the material has deformed lamellarly. = 研究人员已经确定该材料已发生层状变形。

过去完成时:
The scientists had already noted the lamellar structure before the analysis. = 科学家们在分析之前就已经注意到了层状结构。
The engineers had discovered the material fractured lamellarly after the incident. = 工程师们在事故发生后发现材料呈层状断裂。

将来时:
The team will study how the material will behave lamellarly under pressure. = 该团队将研究该材料在压力下将如何表现出层状行为。
The researchers will observe the lamellar formation of the crystals.  = 研究人员将观察晶体的层状形成。

虚拟语气:
If the material were to deform, it would do so lamellarly. = 如果材料要变形，它将呈层状变形。
It would be helpful if the data showed the lamellar arrangement clearly. = 如果数据清晰地显示层状排列，那将会有所帮助。

被动语态:
The lamellar structure was observed in the sample. = 在样品中观察到层状结构。
The material was shown to have fractured lamellarly. = 材料被证明呈层状断裂。

疑问句:
Does the material cleave lamellarly? = 该材料是否呈层状解理？
Is this lamellar structure typical of this mineral? = 这种层状结构是这种矿物的典型特征吗？

否定句:
The growth was not lamellarly; it was amorphous. = 生长不是层状的；它是无定形的。
The fracture surface did not show a lamellar pattern. = 断裂面没有显示层状图案。


PHRASE->
