/ˌfoʊnəloʊdʒaɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 语音化；音位化 | The process by which a previously non-phonemic distinction in a language becomes phonemic, often through sound change.  This means that a difference in sound that previously didn't distinguish meaning now does. For example, if a language had /p/ and /b/ sounds but they were used interchangeably without changing the meaning of a word, and then they became distinct sounds that *did* change meaning, that would be phonologization. | The phonologization of aspirated and unaspirated plosives in English led to minimal pairs like 'pin' and 'bin'.  | 近义词:sound change, phonetic differentiation | 反义词:dephonologization
