词源说明:  The word "prelabors" is a combination of "pre-" (meaning before) and "labors" (referring to the pains and efforts of childbirth).  It's a relatively recent term, a descriptive compound formed to clearly indicate the preparations and early stages of labor.  It doesn't have a classical root like many older words.
