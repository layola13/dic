词源:

* **self-**:  Prefix meaning "of or relating to oneself."  From Old English *self, *sylf.

* **destruction**: From Old French *destruction, ultimately from Latin *destructionem, a noun of action from the verb *destruere, meaning "to destroy."  *destruere is composed of *de- (meaning "away, off, down") and *struere ("to build, arrange, pile up").  Therefore, *destruere literally meant "to unbuild," "to pull down."
