词源:
The word "dutifulness" is derived from the adjective "dutiful," which in turn comes from the Old French word "devoir," meaning "to owe," "to be obliged," or "duty."  The suffix "-ful" adds the meaning of "full of" or "characterized by," thus creating "dutiful," meaning "full of duty" or "characterized by a sense of duty."  Adding the suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the quality or state of being dutiful.
