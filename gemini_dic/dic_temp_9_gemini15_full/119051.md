The word "metif" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  There may be a misspelling, a proper noun not widely recognized, or a word from a specialized field.  If you can provide more context (like a sentence where you encountered the word, or the source material), I can offer a more helpful response.
