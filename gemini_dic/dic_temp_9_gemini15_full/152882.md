词源:

Pedantry ultimately derives from the French word "pédant," which in turn comes from the Italian word "pedante."  These words refer to a schoolmaster or teacher who is overly strict or insistent on rules and details. The meaning then evolved to encompass the broader sense of excessive display of learning.
