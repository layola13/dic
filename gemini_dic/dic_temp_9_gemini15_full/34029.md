词源:

The word "citric" is derived from the word "citrus," referring to citrus fruits, which are a rich source of citric acid.  "-ic" is a suffix used to form adjectives from nouns. "Acid" comes from the Latin word "acidus," meaning "sour" or "sharp."  Therefore, citric acid literally means "acid from citrus fruits."
