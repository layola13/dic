词源:

The word "pirate" comes from the late Middle English word *pirat*, ultimately derived from the Late Latin word *pirata*, which in turn comes from the Greek word πειρατής (peiratēs), meaning "one who attempts," "one who tries," or "attacker."  The Greek word further derives from the verb πειράω (peiraō), meaning "to try," "to attempt," or "to make an attack."  Thus, the original meaning of "pirate" was simply someone who attempts or attacks, with the nautical connotation developing later.
