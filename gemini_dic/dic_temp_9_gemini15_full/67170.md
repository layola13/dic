词源:

The word "expostulatively" derives from the verb "expostulate," which comes from the Late Latin *expostulare, meaning "to demand, require, complain strongly."  This in turn is formed from the prefix "ex-" (out, from) and "postulare" (to demand, request). The suffix "-ive" forms an adjective, and "-ly" turns it into an adverb.
