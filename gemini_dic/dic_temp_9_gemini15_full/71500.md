词源:
The word "flange" comes from the Middle Dutch word "vlange," meaning "a flat edge or rim."  This ultimately derives from the Old French word "flanc," meaning "side" or "flank."  The use of the word to describe a projecting rim on a pipe or wheel predates its use in audio engineering.  The use in audio engineering is a metaphorical extension of the original meaning, referring to the way the effect creates a swirling, "flanged" sound.
