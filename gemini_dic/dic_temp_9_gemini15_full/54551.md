词源:
The word "dislocate" comes from the Old French word "disloquer," which is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart," "away") and "loquer" (meaning "to place" or "to put").  Thus, its literal meaning is "to put apart," or "to displace."  This ultimately derives from the Latin prefix "dis-" and the Latin verb "locare" (to place).
