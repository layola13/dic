词源:
The word "heart-stopping" is a compound adjective formed from "heart" and "stopping."  "Heart" refers to the organ responsible for pumping blood, and its use here relates to the feeling of a racing or pounding heart. "Stopping"  implies a sudden halt or cessation of something, often breath or movement due to intense emotion.  The combination suggests an experience so intense it literally feels like it might stop your heart.
