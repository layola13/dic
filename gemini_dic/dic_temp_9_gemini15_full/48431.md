词源:
The word "deductibilities" is derived from the verb "deduct," meaning to subtract or take away.  The suffix "-ible" means "capable of being," and the further suffix "-ities" forms a plural noun indicating multiple instances of something.  Therefore, "deductibilities" refers to multiple things that are capable of being deducted.
