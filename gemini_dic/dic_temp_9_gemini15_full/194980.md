词源:
The word "semi-skimmed" is a compound word.  "Semi" is derived from Latin, meaning "half" or "partly."  "Skimmed" is the past participle of the verb "skim," which refers to removing cream or fat from the surface of milk.  Therefore, "semi-skimmed" literally means "partially skimmed," indicating that some, but not all, of the fat has been removed from the milk.
