PHRASE->

词源:

The word "concupiscent" comes from the Late Latin word *concupiscibilis*, meaning "desirable," from *concupiscere*, "to desire eagerly," which is a combination of the prefix *con-* (together, intensely) and *cupiscere*, "to desire."  The English word reflects the transition of meaning from general strong desire to specifically sexual desire.
