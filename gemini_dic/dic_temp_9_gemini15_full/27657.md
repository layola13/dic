词源:
The word "candidateship" is derived from the word "candidate," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "candidatus," meaning "clothed in white." In ancient Rome, candidates for office wore white togas.  The suffix "-ship" denotes state, condition, or quality. Therefore, "candidateship" signifies the state or condition of being a candidate.
