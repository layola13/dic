lenticel:/ˈlɛntɪsɛl/| n.|皮孔|A lenticel is a small pore, usually on the stem of a woody plant, that allows gas exchange between the atmosphere and the internal tissues of the plant.  They appear as slightly raised, porous spots on the surface of the bark.  Lenticels are crucial for respiration and the regulation of gas exchange, particularly in woody plants where the bark can otherwise restrict gas flow.|The apple's skin showed numerous lenticels.|近义词：pore, opening|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The lenticels facilitate gas exchange. = 皮孔促进气体交换。
Plants rely on lenticels for respiration. = 植物依靠皮孔进行呼吸作用。

一般过去时:
Scientists observed the lenticels under a microscope. = 科学家在显微镜下观察了皮孔。
The damaged bark exposed the lenticels. = 受损的树皮露出了皮孔。

现在完成时:
Researchers have studied the function of lenticels for decades. = 研究人员几十年来一直在研究皮孔的功能。
The tree has developed many new lenticels this year. = 这棵树今年长出了许多新的皮孔。

过去完成时:
The lenticels had already closed before the frost arrived. = 霜冻来临之前，皮孔已经关闭了。
The plant had lost many lenticels due to disease. = 由于疾病，植物已经失去了许多皮孔。


将来时:
The research will explore the role of lenticels in drought tolerance. = 这项研究将探讨皮孔在抗旱性中的作用。
Scientists will investigate how lenticels respond to pollution. = 科学家将研究皮孔如何应对污染。


虚拟语气:
If the lenticels were blocked, the plant would suffocate. = 如果皮孔被堵塞，植物就会窒息。
It would be beneficial if we better understood lenticel function. = 如果我们更好地理解皮孔的功能，将是有益的。


被动语态:
Lenticels are often studied in plant physiology. = 皮孔经常在植物生理学中被研究。
The size and distribution of lenticels are affected by environmental factors. = 皮孔的大小和分布受环境因素影响。


疑问句:
How do lenticels contribute to plant health? = 皮孔如何促进植物健康？
What is the mechanism by which lenticels regulate gas exchange? = 皮孔调节气体交换的机制是什么？


否定句:
The plant did not have visible lenticels on its stem. = 植物的茎上没有可见的皮孔。
The experiment did not show a significant effect on lenticel function. = 实验没有显示对皮孔功能的显著影响。


PHRASE->
lenticel formation = 皮孔形成
lenticel density = 皮孔密度
lenticel structure = 皮孔结构
lenticel distribution = 皮孔分布
lenticel function = 皮孔功能
