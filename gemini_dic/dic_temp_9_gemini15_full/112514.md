词源:  The word "lout" (meaning a clumsy or uncouth person)  has existed since the Middle English period, likely derived from Old Norse. The verb form "louting," specifically in the sense of idle wandering, is a more recent development, possibly arising as a figurative extension of the noun's meaning.  The sense of aimless wandering is implied by the image of a clumsy person moving without purpose.
