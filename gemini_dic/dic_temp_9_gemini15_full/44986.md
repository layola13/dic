crystallizations:/ˌkrɪstələˈzeɪʃənz/ | n. |结晶作用；结晶；具体化 | The process by which a solid forms, where the atoms or molecules are highly organized into a structure known as a crystal.  This can occur from a liquid or a gas. Crystallizations can also refer to the formation of a clear, definite idea or opinion. |例句：The slow crystallization of the molten rock formed beautiful crystals.  缓慢的熔岩结晶形成了美丽的晶体。

The crystallization of her thoughts led to a clear plan of action. 她思想的具体化导致了一个清晰的行动计划。 |近义词：solidification, formation, concretization |反义词：amorphization, liquefaction
