词源:  The word derives from "moron," which entered English in the early 20th century from the medical field.  It was originally a clinical term designating a person with mild intellectual disability, but has become an informal insult signifying stupidity. The suffix "-ities" creates a noun referring to the qualities or characteristics of something.  Therefore, "moronities" describes the collection of behaviors and actions typical of a moron.
