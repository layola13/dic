词源:
The word "seasoned" comes from the verb "season," which originally meant "to make fit for use" or "to mature."  This relates to the practice of seasoning food with spices to improve its flavor and preservation. Over time, the meaning extended to people, signifying that they have become "fit for use" or "mature" through experience.  The connection lies in the idea of something being improved and enhanced through a process of time and exposure.  The root is likely connected to the Old French word *saision* (season), and ultimately to the Latin word *satiare* (to satisfy, to fill).
