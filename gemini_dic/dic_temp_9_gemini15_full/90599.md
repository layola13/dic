The word "hullos" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a regional dialect word, or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide you with a helpful response, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered "hullos."
