词源:

The word "demagogueries" is derived from the noun "demagogue"  and the suffix "-eries". "Demagogue" itself originates from the Greek words "dēmos" (people) and "agōgos" (leader), literally meaning "leader of the people". However, the modern connotation of demagogue is strongly negative, implying a leader who manipulates and deceives the people for their own gain.  The "-eries" suffix denotes a collection or a series of instances of something.

* Exaggeration and distortion of facts.
* Appeals to emotion (fear, anger, hatred, etc.).
* Simplification of complex issues.
* Use of inflammatory language.
* Personal attacks against opponents.
* Creation of "us vs. them" mentality.


The plural form "demagogueries" is used to refer to multiple instances of such manipulative rhetoric or behavior.
