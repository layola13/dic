dunites:/ˈdʌnaɪts/ | n. |橄榄岩|A dunite is a type of igneous rock composed almost entirely of olivine.  It is a dark-colored, dense rock that is found in various geological settings, often associated with other ultramafic rocks. Dunites are important because they provide insights into the Earth's mantle composition. |Example:  The researchers analyzed the dunite samples to determine the age and origin of the volcanic intrusion.  研究人员分析了橄榄岩样本以确定火山侵入体的年龄和成因。|近义词：peridotite (a broader category of ultramafic rock)|反义词：granite (felsic rock)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The dunite contains a high percentage of olivine. = 这种橄榄岩含有高比例的橄榄石。
Dunites are often found near kimberlite pipes. = 橄榄岩通常在金伯利岩筒附近发现。

一般过去时:
Geologists studied the dunite samples from the field trip. = 地质学家研究了实地考察中采集的橄榄岩样本。
They discovered a new type of mineral within the dunite. = 他们在橄榄岩中发现了一种新型矿物。

现在完成时:
