词源:
The word "rigmarole" (from which "rigmarolery" is derived) is of uncertain origin.  Possible etymologies include a connection to the word "ragamuffin" suggesting a chaotic or disordered state, or a possible origin from a combination of words relating to a "roll" or "list" implying a lengthy procedure. The suffix "-ery" adds a sense of abundance or excessive nature.
