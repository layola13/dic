词源:

The word "humankind" is a relatively modern compound word, combining "human" (from Latin *hūmānus, meaning "human, belonging to man") and "kind" (from Old English *cynn, meaning "family, race, generation").  The combination reflects a shift away from the arguably gendered "mankind" towards more inclusive language.
