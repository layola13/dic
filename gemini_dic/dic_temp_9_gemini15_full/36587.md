collateralnesses:/ˌkɒlætərəlˈnɛsɪz/| n.|担保物性质；抵押品性质；附属物性质|The word "collateralnesses" is extremely rare and not found in standard dictionaries. It's a plural form derived from "collateralness," which itself is an uncommon word.  It implies multiple instances of something being collateral, a secondary or supplementary aspect, or something used as security for a loan.  The word suggests a focus on the *nature* of being collateral, rather than the collateral items themselves.  Because of its rarity, constructing grammatically correct and semantically meaningful sentences using it is challenging.|例句：The multiple collateralnesses of the agreement were carefully examined by the lawyers.  (律师们仔细审查了协议中多方面的担保性质。)  The judge considered the various collateralnesses of the case before reaching a verdict. (法官在做出判决之前考虑了案件的各种附属性质。)|近义词:  secondary aspects, supplementary features, collateral attributes|反义词:  primary aspects, main features, core elements|名词
