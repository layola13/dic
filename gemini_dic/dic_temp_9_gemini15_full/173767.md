词源:
"Quasi-" is a Latin prefix meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent."  "Orientally" derives from "orient," ultimately from Latin *oriens ("rising"), referring to the rising sun and thus the East.  Therefore, "quasi-orientally" means something that resembles or suggests an Eastern style but may not be purely or authentically so.
