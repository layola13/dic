The word "derling" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "darling," "dearie," or another word entirely.
2. **A dialect word:** It might be a regionalism or a word used within a specific community or family.
3. **A newly coined word:** It could be a recently invented word not yet widely adopted.
4. **A proper noun:** It could be a name or place name.

To provide a proper analysis, please double-check the spelling or provide more context about where you encountered this word.  If you can provide more information, I can try to help.
