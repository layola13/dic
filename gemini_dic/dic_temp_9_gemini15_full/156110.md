photosphere:/ˈfoʊtoʊsfɪər/| n. |光球层|The visible surface of the sun, a layer of incandescent gas about 300 miles thick.  It is the source of most of the sunlight we see.|Example:  Sunspots are dark areas on the photosphere that are cooler than the surrounding areas. 太阳黑子是光球层上比周围区域温度低的暗区。|近义词：solar surface|反义词：corona (太阳日冕), chromosphere (色球层)
