overdiversity:/ˌoʊvərdaɪˈvɜːrsɪti/| n. |过度多样化；物种过度丰富|The term "overdiversity" describes a situation where there is an excessive number of species or types within a particular ecosystem or area, potentially leading to instability or negative consequences.  This contrasts with biodiversity, which generally refers to the variety of life within an ecosystem.  Overdiversity can be detrimental because it can strain resources, lead to increased competition, and potentially decrease overall ecosystem stability.  It's not a widely accepted or standardized term in ecology, and its use is often context-dependent.|例句：The introduction of numerous invasive species led to overdiversity in the local flora, causing imbalances in the ecosystem.  = 引入众多入侵物种导致当地植物群落过度多样化，造成生态系统失衡。The research suggests that overdiversity in the market can hinder efficient resource allocation. = 研究表明，市场过度多样化可能会阻碍有效资源配置。|近义词：excessive diversity, hyperdiversity, superfluity of species|反义词：underdiversity, low biodiversity, homogeneity|名词
