endostoma: /ˌɛndoʊˈstoʊmə/ | n. | 内骨膜 |

英文解析:A thin layer of connective tissue lining the medullary cavity of a bone.  It's involved in bone formation and resorption.  It's distinct from the periosteum, which covers the outer surface of the bone.

例句:
The endostoma plays a crucial role in bone remodeling. = 内骨膜在骨骼重塑中起着至关重要的作用。

The study examined the cellular composition of the endostoma. = 这项研究检查了内骨膜的细胞组成。


近义词:  (There isn't a direct synonym, as endostome is quite specific.  Related terms might include:)  medullary lining, inner bone membrane

反义词: periosteum (outer bone membrane)


词源:  From Greek "endon" (within) + "ostoun" (bone).  Therefore, it literally means "within the bone."
