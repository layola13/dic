词源：
The word "chow" as a term for food, particularly Chinese food, likely originates from the pidgin English of the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Its exact etymology is debated, but it may be related to Cantonese terms for food or cooking. The use of "chow" to refer to a dog, particularly small breeds, is believed to be derived from the breed name "Chow Chow."  The Chow Chow breed's name itself is thought to originate from a corruption of the Cantonese word for "dog," possibly influenced by traders in the area.
