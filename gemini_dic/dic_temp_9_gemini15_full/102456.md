词源:

The word "jackknife"  originates from its resemblance to the action of a folding pocketknife. The "jack" part is of uncertain origin, but it's possibly related to the common use of the word "jack" to refer to a small, handy tool or device.  The "knife" part is straightforward. Thus, the term suggests a knife that folds in a similar manner to a common "jack" tool.
