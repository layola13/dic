用法说明：

semiprofanely is an adverb modifying a verb, adjective, or another adverb to describe an action or state that is somewhat profane or offensive, but not excessively so. It suggests a degree of impiety or disrespect that falls short of outright blasphemy or obscenity.  It often describes language that hints at or alludes to profanity rather than using explicit profane words.

The word is relatively uncommon and might be considered informal or even somewhat humorous, depending on the context.
