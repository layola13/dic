Etymology:

The word "orgulous" ultimately derives from the Old French word "orgueilleus," meaning "proud," "haughty," or "arrogant."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "orgullus," which is a variant of "orgoglio," meaning "pride."  The evolution of the word reflects a shift from a more general sense of pride to a more specific connotation of arrogant pride or self-importance.  "Orgulous," while sharing a root with "orgoglio," has become a relatively rare and literary word in modern English, retaining a distinct flavor of antiquated formality.
