organotrophic:/ˌɔːrɡənəˈtroʊfɪk/ | adj. | 器官营养的；有机营养的 | Relating to or denoting organisms that obtain energy from organic compounds.  Organotrophic organisms utilize organic molecules as their primary source of carbon and energy. This contrasts with lithotrophic organisms, which obtain energy from inorganic compounds. | Example: Many bacteria are organotrophic, deriving their energy from the breakdown of organic matter.  许多细菌是有机营养的，它们从有机物的分解中获取能量。|近义词：heterotrophic | 反义词：lithotrophic
