/ˌɪrˌɛduːsəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 不可约性；不可简化性 | The inherent inability of something to be reduced or simplified further.  It often refers to a fundamental, indivisible aspect of a system or concept.  In mathematics, it refers to a property that cannot be broken down into simpler components. In philosophy, it can refer to an irreducible element of experience. | Example: The irreducibilities of quantum mechanics make it difficult to reconcile with classical physics. 量子力学的不可约性使其难以与经典物理学调和。 The irreducibilities of human experience are often explored in existentialist philosophy. 人类经验的不可约性经常在存在主义哲学中被探讨。 | 近义词:  unreducibility, indivisibility, essentiality | 反义词: reducibility, simplicity, decomposability | 名词
