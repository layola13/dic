diathermanous: /ˌdaɪəˈθɜːrmənəs/ | adj. |透热的；透热的；能透过热的|

英文解析:  Allowing the passage of radiant heat; transmitting radiant heat.  A diathermanous substance allows infrared radiation to pass through it relatively unimpeded.  This is distinct from transparency to visible light.  For example, glass is transparent to visible light but relatively diathermanous, while some plastics are both transparent and diathermanous.

例句:

Glass is diathermanous to infrared radiation. = 玻璃对红外辐射是透热的。

Many gases are highly diathermanous. = 许多气体都是高度透热的。


近义词:  transparent (in the context of radiant heat), heat-permeable

反义词:  adiathermanous (opaque to radiant heat)


词源:  From Greek *dia- (through) + therme (heat) + -anous (suffix indicating a property).  It literally means "heat-through."
