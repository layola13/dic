The word "quair" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding or spelled word?  Please double-check your spelling.
* It's a regional dialect word:  It might be used in a specific geographic location or within a particular community.  If you can provide context (where you encountered the word), it might be possible to find a meaning.
* It's a newly coined word or a proper noun:  It may be a very recent invention or a name (perhaps of a person, place, or thing).

Please provide more information if you'd like assistance in finding the word's meaning.
