enterotome:/ˈɛntərətoʊm/| n. |肠毒素切割酶|An enterotome is a hypothetical enzyme that could cleave enterotoxins, rendering them harmless.  It's a term used more in theoretical discussions about toxin neutralization than in established medical practice.  There is currently no known naturally occurring or engineered enterotome.  The word is constructed from "entero-" (intestine) and "-tome" (cutting instrument/enzyme).|例句：Research into a hypothetical enterotome continues, aiming to create a safe and effective method of neutralizing enterotoxins.|近义词：There are no direct synonyms, as the term itself is hypothetical.|反义词：There are no direct antonyms, as the term describes a hypothetical process.

USAGE->
