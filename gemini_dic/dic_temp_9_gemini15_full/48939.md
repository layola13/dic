词源：

Derived from the adjective "defunct" (meaning no longer existing or functioning), which in turn comes from the Latin word "defunctus," the past participle of "defungi," meaning "to perform," "to fulfill," or "to finish."  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being defunct.
