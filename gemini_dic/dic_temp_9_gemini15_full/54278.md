词源:

disguisedness comes from the verb "disguise," which itself originates from the Old French word "desguiser," meaning "to disguise."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, indicating a state or quality.  The Old French word ultimately derives from the Old North French word "des" (from Latin "dis-" meaning "apart") and "guiser," which is of uncertain origin but possibly related to words meaning "to look" or "to appear".

用法说明：

Disguisedness refers to the act, state, or quality of being disguised. It implies an attempt to conceal one's true identity, appearance, or nature.  It can be used to describe the effectiveness of the disguise or the degree to which something is hidden.  The word is relatively uncommon in everyday conversation but is suitable for more formal writing.
