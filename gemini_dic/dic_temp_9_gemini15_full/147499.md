overoxidizing: /ˌoʊvərˈɑːksɪdaɪzɪŋ/ | v. | 过度氧化 |  The process of oxidizing something beyond the desired or optimal level.  It often leads to undesirable side effects or degradation of the material. |  Example: Overoxidizing the metal caused it to become brittle and prone to cracking.  过度氧化金属使其变得易碎且容易开裂。 | 近义词: hyperoxidizing, excessively oxidizing | 反义词: underoxidizing, insufficient oxidation
