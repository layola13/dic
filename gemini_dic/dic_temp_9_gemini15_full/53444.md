词源:
The word "disappreciate" is formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") to the verb "appreciate."  The root of "appreciate" comes from the Latin word "appreciare," meaning "to estimate the value of," ultimately deriving from "ad" (to) and "pretium" (price, value). Therefore, "disappreciate" literally means "to not value" or "to undervalue."
