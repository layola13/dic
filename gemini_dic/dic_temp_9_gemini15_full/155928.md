photodimeric:/ˌfoʊtoʊdaɪˈmɛrɪk/| adj.| 光二聚体的；光致二聚的 | Relating to or denoting a photodimer, or the formation of a photodimer.  A photodimer is a dimer (a molecule formed from two similar subunits) formed by the photochemical reaction (a chemical reaction initiated by light) of two identical molecules. | Example: Photodimeric reactions are important in DNA damage and repair. 光二聚反应在DNA损伤和修复中很重要。 | 近义词：photochemically linked, light-induced dimerized | 反义词：monomeric
