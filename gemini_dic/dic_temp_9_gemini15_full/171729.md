pumpability: /ˌpʌmpəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可泵性，可抽送性 | The ability of a fluid to be pumped.  This refers to the ease with which a fluid can be transported through a pump, pipeline or other system.  It's influenced by factors like viscosity, temperature, and the presence of solids. | Example: The pumpability of the slurry was significantly improved by adding a flow improver.  (浆料的可泵性通过添加助流剂得到了显著改善。)


近义词:  flowability,  transportability (in specific contexts)

反义词:  unpumpability


词源:  Derived from the verb "pump" + "-able" (suffix indicating capability) + "-ity" (suffix forming nouns of quality or state).  The root "pump" has origins in Middle English, possibly from Old French "pompe" or a related Germanic word.


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in technical contexts, particularly in engineering, particularly relating to fluids (liquids, slurries, etc.):


一般现在时:
The pumpability of this oil is excellent. =这种油的可泵性极佳。
This material shows good pumpability at high temperatures. =这种材料在高温下表现出良好的可泵性。


一般过去时:
The pumpability of the concrete was tested yesterday. = 昨天对混凝土的可泵性进行了测试。
The engineers found that the pumpability decreased after the mixture cooled. =工程师们发现混合物冷却后可泵性下降了。


现在完成时:
We have improved the pumpability of the product. = 我们已经提高了产品的可泵性。
Tests have shown that the pumpability remains consistent. = 测试表明可泵性保持一致。


过去完成时:
They had already assessed the pumpability before starting the project. = 他们在开始项目之前已经评估了可泵性。
The engineers had determined that the poor pumpability was due to high viscosity. = 工程师们已经确定可泵性差是由于高粘度造成的。


将来时:
We will test the pumpability under various pressure conditions. = 我们将在不同的压力条件下测试可泵性。
The new additives will improve the pumpability significantly. = 新的添加剂将显著提高可泵性。


被动语态:
The pumpability of the fluid was affected by the temperature. = 流体的可泵性受温度影响。
The pumpability is being monitored continuously during the process. = 在整个过程中，可泵性正在持续监测。


PHRASE->
There are not many common idiomatic phrases using "pumpability".  The word is largely used as a technical term on its own.  However, we can construct some phrases relating to it:


good pumpability = 良好的可泵性
poor pumpability = 差的可泵性
improved pumpability = 提高的可泵性
testing pumpability = 测试可泵性
pumpability characteristics = 可泵性特性
