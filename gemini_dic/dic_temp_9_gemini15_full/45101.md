词源:

The word "cuckoldly" derives from the word "cuckold," which itself has a rich and somewhat obscure etymology.  The Old English word *cuccu was used to refer to the cuckoo bird, known for its habit of laying its eggs in other birds' nests.  This parasitic behavior led to the figurative use of "cuckold" to describe a man whose wife is unfaithful, as he is unknowingly raising another man's child.  The suffix "-ly" transforms the noun into an adjective, signifying a quality or characteristic associated with being a cuckold.
