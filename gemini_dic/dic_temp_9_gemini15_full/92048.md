hyperphosphorylated:/ˌhaɪpərˈfɒsfəreɪtɪd/| adj. |过度磷酸化的|  Excessively phosphorylated;  having more phosphate groups attached than usual. This typically refers to proteins or other molecules where the addition of phosphate groups alters their function.  |例句：The hyperphosphorylated tau protein is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease.  过度磷酸化的tau蛋白是阿尔茨海默病的标志。

The hyperphosphorylation of certain proteins can lead to cellular dysfunction.某些蛋白质的过度磷酸化会导致细胞功能障碍。|近义词：overphosphorylated |反义词：hypophosphorylated

否定句:
The protein is not hyperphosphorylated under normal conditions. = 在正常条件下，蛋白质不会过度磷酸化。
The results showed that the protein was not hyperphosphorylated in the control group. = 结果表明，对照组中的蛋白质未发生过度磷酸化。


PHRASE->
hyperphosphorylated tau protein  过度磷酸化的tau蛋白
hyperphosphorylated protein  过度磷酸化的蛋白质
degree of hyperphosphorylation 过度磷酸化的程度
