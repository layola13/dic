词源:
The word "encouraged" comes from the Old French word "encoragier," which means "to give courage to."  The prefix "en-" means "in" or "into," and "coragier" is related to the Latin word "cor," meaning "heart."  Therefore, the word's root signifies the act of putting courage into someone's heart.
