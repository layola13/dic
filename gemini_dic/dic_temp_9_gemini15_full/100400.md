The word "intertalk" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word), a misspelling, or a word from a very specialized or niche context.

To provide a helpful response, I need more information.  Is this word from a specific book, article, game, or other source? Knowing its context will help determine its meaning and allow for a more accurate analysis.
