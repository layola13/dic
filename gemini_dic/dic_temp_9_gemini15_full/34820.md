词源:
The word "clinching" comes from the verb "clinch," which originally meant "to fasten or secure something, especially by bending over or closing." This usage derives from the Middle English word "clinch," possibly related to the Old Norse word "klynska," meaning "to grasp tightly."  The sense of "making something certain or final" developed later.
