The word "nonsilvers" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word), a misspelling, or a word specific to a niche context.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need more context where you encountered this word.  For example:

* **Where did you see this word?** (book, website, conversation, etc.)
* **What was the surrounding text?** This will help determine the intended meaning.

Once you provide this context, I can offer a more accurate interpretation and attempt to provide an analysis similar to your example.
