nonarbitrarinesses:/ˌnɒnˌɑːrbɪˈtrɛəriənɪsiz/| n. |非任意性;非随意性|The plural form of "nonarbitrariness," referring to instances or aspects of language where the relationship between a word's form and its meaning is not arbitrary.  This concept is central to the study of linguistics, particularly in contrasting with the arbitrariness of the sign in Saussurean linguistics.  Nonarbitrariness often manifests as onomatopoeia, iconic signs, or other cases where the form of a word directly reflects its meaning.|The examples of nonarbitrarinesses in English are relatively few compared to the vast number of arbitrary word-meaning pairings.  However, words like "buzz," "hiss," and "meow" are considered nonarbitrarinesses due to their phonetic resemblance to the sounds they represent.|近义词:iconicity, motivation (in linguistic terms)|反义词:arbitrariness
