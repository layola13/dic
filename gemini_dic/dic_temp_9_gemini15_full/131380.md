近义词：imprudent, reckless, careless, thoughtless, rash, heedless


反义词：circumspect, cautious, prudent, careful, thoughtful, wary


词源：The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "circumspect," which comes from the Latin "circumspicere," meaning "to look around."  "Circum-" means "around" and "spicere" means "to look."  Therefore, "circumspect" literally means "to look around carefully," implying caution and forethought.  "Noncircumspect" thus means the opposite: lacking in careful consideration.
