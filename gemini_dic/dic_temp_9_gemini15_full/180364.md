词源:
The word "refurbishing" comes from the verb "refurbish," which itself is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and "furnish" (meaning "to equip or supply with what is needed").  Therefore, "refurbish" literally means "to furnish again," implying a renewal or restoration.  The "-ing" suffix turns it into a gerund, functioning as a noun.
