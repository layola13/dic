overornamentally styled clothes: 过度装饰的衣服
overornamentally decorated cake: 过度装饰的蛋糕
overornamentally furnished room: 过度装饰的房间
overornamentally appointed office: 过度装饰的办公室


词源:

The word is formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively), "ornament" (meaning decoration), and the adverbial suffix "-ally" (meaning "in the manner of").  Therefore, the word literally means "in an excessively ornamented manner."
