词源:

From obsolete + -escence (suffix denoting a process or state of becoming).  "Obsolete" itself comes from the Latin *obsoletus, past participle of *obsolēscere, meaning "to grow obsolete," from *ob- ("away, from") + *solēre ("to be accustomed").  Thus, the word's roots suggest the process of something becoming unaccustomed or out of use.
