词源:
The word "democratize" comes from the Greek word "dēmos" (δήμος), meaning "people," and "kratos" (κράτος), meaning "power" or "rule."  The suffix "-ize" indicates "to make" or "to cause to become."  Therefore, "democratize" literally means "to make the power of the people."  The word evolved through the French "démocratie" and then into English.
