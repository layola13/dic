Etymology:  The word "narghileh" (or variations thereof, such as "narghile") originates from the Persian word  نارگیله (nārgīleh), which itself may have roots in the Sanskrit word  नारिकेल (nārikela), meaning "coconut."  This likely refers to the shape of the early water pipes, which resembled a coconut. The word then spread through the Ottoman Empire and into other languages.
