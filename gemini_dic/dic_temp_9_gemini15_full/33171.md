chromid:/ˈkroʊmɪd/| n. |染色体片段，染色质体|A chromid is a fragment of a chromosome that is not attached to the main chromosome body.  It can be found in some bacteria and other organisms. Chromids often contain genes that are essential for the organism's survival, but they are not always necessary for reproduction. They are often associated with plasmids, which are small, circular DNA molecules that can replicate independently of the main chromosome. |Example: The researchers observed several chromids in the bacterial culture.  研究人员在细菌培养物中观察到几个染色体片段。  |近义词:chromosome fragment, plasmid (in some contexts)|反义词:None specifically, but could be contrasted with a complete chromosome.
