词源:
The word "marketstead" is a compound word formed from "market" and "stead."  "Market" derives from Old French "marchet," meaning "market," ultimately from Old High German "mark," a boundary or region. "Stead" is an Old English word meaning "place," "site," or "location."  Therefore, "marketstead" literally means "market place" or "market site."
