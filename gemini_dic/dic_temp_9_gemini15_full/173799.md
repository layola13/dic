词源:

The word "quasi-pious" is a compound word.

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."

* **pious**: From Latin *pius*, meaning "dutiful," "religious," or "devout."  This word has a long history in English, tracing back to Old French and ultimately to Latin.

Therefore, "quasi-pious" literally means "as if pious" or "seemingly pious," highlighting the insincerity implied.
