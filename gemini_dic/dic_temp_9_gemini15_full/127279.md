naves:/ˈneɪvz/| n.|中殿；船体；（教堂的）中殿|The naves of the cathedral were breathtakingly beautiful.|近义词：aisle, nave (有时可互换)|反义词：无


英文解析：The word "naves" is the plural form of "nave."  A nave refers to the central part of a church, extending from the entrance to the altar, or the central part of a ship's hull.  The term originates from the Latin word "navis," meaning "ship." This reflects the architectural resemblance of some early churches' naves to the interior of an upturned ship.
