词源:  The word "indeliberate" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "deliberate," which means "intentional" or "carefully considered."  The root of "deliberate" traces back to the Latin verb "liberare," meaning "to weigh, consider, or set free."  Therefore, "indeliberate" literally means "not weighed, considered, or pondered."
