词源：

The word derives from "provincial," meaning relating to or characteristic of a province;  narrow or limited in outlook. The "-ist" suffix transforms the adjective into a noun, denoting a person who embodies the quality.  The root ultimately traces back to the Latin word "provincia," meaning "province," a territory governed by a Roman official.
