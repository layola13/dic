polysulphide: /ˈpɒliˈsʌlfaɪd/| n. |多硫化物|A polysulfide is a chemical compound containing a chain of sulfur atoms.  These chains can vary in length, resulting in different polysulfide compounds. They are often found in inorganic chemistry and have various applications.  For example, polysulfides are used in the vulcanization of rubber, giving it elasticity and strength. They are also found in some minerals and can be involved in biological processes. |The vulcanization process uses polysulfides to cross-link the polymer chains in rubber, making it more durable. |近义词:sulfide (less specific)|反义词:N/A

词源:
The word "polysulfide" comes from the combination of "poly-" (meaning "many") and "sulfide" (a compound containing sulfur).  "Sulfide" itself derives from the element sulfur.  Therefore, the word literally means a compound with many sulfur atoms.
