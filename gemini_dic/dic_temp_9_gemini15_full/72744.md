fogbow:/ˈfɒɡboʊ/| n. |雾虹，白虹|A fogbow is an optical phenomenon similar to a rainbow, but formed by the diffraction of light by water droplets in fog instead of raindrops.  Unlike rainbows, fogbows typically appear white or very faintly colored due to the smaller size of the water droplets. |Example: We saw a beautiful fogbow stretching across the valley this morning.  今天早上我们看到一道美丽的雾虹横跨山谷。|近义词：white rainbow, cloudbow|反义词：rainbow
