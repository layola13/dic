luminosity:/ˌluːmɪˈnɒsəti/ /ˌluːməˈnɑːsəti/| n. |光度，发光强度|The inherent power of a celestial body to emit light; the amount of light emitted by a star, galaxy, or other celestial object.  It's a measure of the total power radiated by an object in the form of electromagnetic radiation, especially light. |例句：The luminosity of the sun is immense.  太阳的光度极其巨大。

例句：Scientists measured the luminosity of the distant galaxy. 科学家测量了遥远星系的光度。


近义词：brightness, radiance, brilliance, splendor|反义词：darkness, obscurity, dimness|词性:名词
