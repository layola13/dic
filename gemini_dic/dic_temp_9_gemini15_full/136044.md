词源:

The word "nonrebellion" is a modern coinage, formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the noun "rebellion."  "Rebellion" itself has roots in the Old French word "rebellion," ultimately derived from the Latin "rebellio," meaning "a rising up against authority."  Therefore, "nonrebellion" directly signifies the absence or opposite of a rebellion.
