词源:
The word "positive" comes from the Latin word "positivus," meaning "placed," "set," or "posited."  This relates to its original meaning of something that is "definitely stated" or "affirmed."  Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass the modern connotations of optimism, certainty, and a good outcome.
