noncrimes:/ˈnɑːnkraɪmz/ | n. |非犯罪行为 | Acts that are not crimes, often involving minor offenses or actions that lack criminal intent.  These can include acts that are morally questionable but not legally prohibited, or actions that are technically illegal but rarely prosecuted due to lack of resources or societal acceptance.  The term often highlights the disparity between societal norms and legal definitions of crime. | Example:  Many acts of civil disobedience, such as minor traffic violations or minor property damage in protests, might be considered noncrimes in the context of the broader social movement.  Another example would be jaywalking, which is technically illegal but rarely enforced unless it poses a significant safety risk. | 近义词：misdemeanors (if minor offenses), infractions, petty offenses | 反义词：felonies, crimes, serious offenses |  名词
