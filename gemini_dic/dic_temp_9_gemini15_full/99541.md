词源:
The word "intergovernmental" is a compound word.  "Inter-" is a prefix meaning "between" or "among," derived from Latin "inter." "Governmental" is an adjective derived from "government," ultimately from Old French "gouvernement" and Latin "gubernaculum" (helm, rudder).  Therefore, "intergovernmental" literally means "between or among governments."
