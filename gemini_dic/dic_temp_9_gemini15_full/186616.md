词源:  The word "riff" originates from the early 20th-century African American musical tradition, particularly jazz. It likely evolved from the verb "to rifle," meaning to search or rummage, possibly referring to the musician's searching for musical ideas.  The specific etymological path is not definitively traced, but its connection to jazz improvisation is clear.
