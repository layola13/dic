chalaziferous:/ˌkæləˈzɪfərəs/| adj.|具胚珠柄的；具珠柄的 | Having a chalazal structure or pertaining to the chalaza.  The term refers to the part of an ovule where the integuments fuse with the nucellus.  It's a relatively uncommon term used primarily in botany and plant biology. | Example:  The chalaziferous structure of the ovule was clearly visible under the microscope. = 在显微镜下，胚珠的珠孔明显可见。 The researchers studied the chalaziferous development in several plant species. = 研究人员研究了几种植物的珠孔发育。|近义词：chalazal (less commonly used in this adjectival form)|反义词：None directly opposite, but terms describing opposite ovule structures could be considered contextual antonyms.
