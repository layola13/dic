/ˌhaɪpərmɪˈstɪkəlniːsəz/ | n. |极度神秘的事物；极度神秘的特性 |The word "hypermysticalnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a nonce word, meaning it's created for a specific occasion and is unlikely to be found in dictionaries.  It's formed by combining several morphemes: "hyper-" (excessive, beyond), "mystical" (relating to mysticism), and "-ness" (state or quality), and then adding another "-ness" to create an intensified superlative.  Therefore, it attempts to convey an extreme or heightened level of mystical qualities or experiences.  Because it's not a standard word, there are no established usages, synonyms, or antonyms.  Its meaning must be inferred from context. | Example:  The author described the ancient rituals with such elaborate detail that they seemed to possess almost unfathomable hypermysticalnesses. (作者以如此详尽的细节描述了古代仪式，以至于它们似乎拥有几乎无法理解的极度神秘特性。) |  N/A | N/A | noun
