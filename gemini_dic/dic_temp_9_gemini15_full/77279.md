The word "gastrura" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage explanation cannot be provided.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of a similar-sounding or related biological term.  If you can provide more context (e.g., where you encountered this word), it might be possible to suggest a correct spelling and definition.

2. **It's a neologism or technical term:** It might be a newly coined word or a term used within a very specific field (perhaps a niche area of biology or medicine).  Again, more context is needed.

3. **It's a non-English word:** It might be a word from another language.  Knowing the language's origin would help in finding its meaning.
