词源:

The word "holocaust" comes from the Greek words  "holos" (whole) and "kaustos" (burnt).  Originally, it referred to a burnt offering or sacrifice.  Its modern usage, referring to the systematic extermination of Jews and others during World War II, developed in the mid-20th century, reflecting the immense scale of destruction and loss of life.
