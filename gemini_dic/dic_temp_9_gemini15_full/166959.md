prestricken: /prɪˈstrɪkən/ | adj. | 预先受打击的；预先受挫的 |  This word is not a standard English word and does not appear in major dictionaries. It seems to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  It likely combines "pre-" (before) and "stricken" (affected by something unpleasant or unfortunate).  Therefore, the intended meaning is probably something that has been negatively impacted before an event or in anticipation of it.  There are no standard usage examples, synonyms, or antonyms because the word is not established.  Grammatical analysis is not applicable due to the word's non-standard nature.
