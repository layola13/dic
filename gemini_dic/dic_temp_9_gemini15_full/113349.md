词源:
Luxuriousness derives from the adjective "luxurious," which itself comes from the Late Middle English word "luxurious," ultimately originating from the Latin word "luxuria" meaning "abundance," "excess," or "luxury."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun signifying the state or quality of being luxurious.
