词源：
The word "puddening" is a variant spelling of "pudding," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "boudin," meaning "black pudding" (a type of sausage).  Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass various sweet and savory cooked dishes, leading to the modern sense of "pudding" and its variant "puddening."
