词源:  The word "self-administrations" is a compound word.  "Self" is an Old English word meaning "one's own," while "administration" comes from the Latin word "administratio," meaning "management" or "supervision."  The "administratio" itself breaks down into "ad" (to) + "ministrare" (to serve).  Therefore, "self-administration" literally means "the management or serving of oneself."
