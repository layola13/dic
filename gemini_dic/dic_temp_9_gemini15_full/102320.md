词源: The term comes from the image of an ivory tower, a metaphorical place of seclusion and isolation, often associated with scholars and intellectuals who are seen as being removed from the concerns of ordinary life.  The metaphor originates from the biblical story of the Tower of Babel, which was built of brick and mortar rather than ivory, but the image of an isolated, unreachable tower has resonated through literary and cultural history. The use of “ivory” likely adds to the sense of luxury and distance from reality.
