The word "fage" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name (person, place, or thing) not included in standard dictionaries.
* **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word or a term used within a specific community or context.
* **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language that hasn't been widely adopted into English.

If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, the surrounding text), I might be able to offer a more accurate interpretation.
