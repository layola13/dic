词源:
The word "recharged" comes from the verb "to charge," meaning to fill something with energy or power.  The prefix "re-" indicates a repetition or renewal of the action.  The original meaning of "charge" in this context relates to the filling of a battery with electrical power, but it has expanded metaphorically to include the revitalization of a person's energy levels.
