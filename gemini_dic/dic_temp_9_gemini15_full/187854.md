词源:
The name "Rosicrucian" is derived from the Latin words "rosa" (rose) and "crux" (cross).  The precise origin and meaning of the rose and cross symbolism remain debated, but it is associated with alchemical and mystical traditions.  The term emerged in the early 17th century with the publication of several manifestos attributed to the Rosicrucians, though the actual historical origins of the order remain shrouded in mystery.
