mucopolysaccharide:/ˌmjuːkoʊˈpɒlɪsækəraɪd/| n. |粘多糖|A complex carbohydrate consisting of a chain of sugar molecules and found in connective tissue.  Mucopolysaccharides are also known as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). They play a crucial role in maintaining the structure and function of various tissues.  |Example:  The study examined the role of mucopolysaccharides in cartilage health. 这项研究考察了粘多糖在软骨健康中的作用。


近义词: glycosaminoglycan (GAG), mucosubstance |反义词:  (no direct antonym,  but substances lacking this structure could be considered opposite in function)|词性:名词
