The word "dousei" is not an English word.  It appears to be a misspelling or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested in the format.  Please provide a correctly spelled English word or specify the language of origin if you'd like a linguistic analysis.
