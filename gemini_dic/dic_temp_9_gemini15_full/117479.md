词源:
The word "meddle" comes from the Old French word *medler*, meaning "to mix," or "to mingle."  This ultimately derives from the Latin word *miscere*, with the same meaning. The sense of interfering or inappropriately involving oneself developed over time from the original meaning of mixing or mingling.
