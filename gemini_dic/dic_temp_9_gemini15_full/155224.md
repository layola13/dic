phaeospore:/ˈfeɪoʊspɔːr/| n. |暗色孢子，褐色孢子|A phaeospore is a spore that is dark-colored, typically brown or olive-green, due to the presence of pigments. These pigments often provide protection from UV radiation. Phaeospores are found in various organisms, including certain algae and fungi.|Example: The *Laminaria* species produced numerous phaeospores during its reproductive cycle.|近义词: dark spore, pigmented spore|反义词: hyaline spore (clear spore)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The *Laminaria* produces phaeospores. = *海带*产生暗色孢子。

We will examine the phaeospores' morphology next week. = 我们下周将检查暗色孢子的形态。
The study will investigate the role of phaeospores in dispersal. = 这项研究将调查暗色孢子在传播中的作用。


虚拟语气:
If the conditions were optimal, more phaeospores would be produced. = 如果条件最佳，将产生更多的暗色孢子。
