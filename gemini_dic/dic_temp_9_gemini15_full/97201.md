词源:

The word "inflammable" comes from the Latin word "inflammare," meaning "to set on fire."  The prefix "in-" in this context doesn't mean "not," but rather "in" or "into," indicating the process of something becoming inflamed or ignited.  The "-able" suffix indicates capability or susceptibility.
