词源:
The word "omelette" comes from the French word "omelette," which itself is derived from the Old French "alemelle," meaning a thin pancake or flat cake.  The evolution reflects a change in the dish's preparation and ingredients over time, from a simple flat cake to the egg-based dish we know today.
