protozooenite:/ˌproʊtəzoʊˈɪnaɪt/| n.|原生动物化石|A protozooenite is a fossilized protozoan.  Protozoa are single-celled eukaryotic organisms, and their fossilization is often challenging due to their delicate structure.  The study of protozooenites provides valuable insights into the evolution and paleoecology of these ancient organisms.|The researchers discovered several well-preserved protozooenites in the sedimentary rock.|近义词: microfossil (a more general term)|反义词:  None specifically, but macroscopic fossil could be considered an antonym in terms of scale.
