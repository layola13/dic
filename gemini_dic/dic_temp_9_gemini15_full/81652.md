The word "Greekly" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no standard pronunciation, grammatical classification, or established usage.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a complete analysis following the requested format.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).

If you intended a different word, please provide the correct spelling.  If you meant to describe something in a "Greek" manner, you could use words and phrases like:

* **Classically:**  This refers to the style and ideals of ancient Greece.
* **In a Hellenic manner:**  "Hellenic" is another term for Greek.
* **With Greek influence:** This emphasizes the impact of Greek culture.
* **In the style of ancient Greece:** More explicit about the time period.

For example, instead of "He behaved Greekly," you could say "He behaved in a classically dramatic manner" or "His actions were influenced by Greek ideals of heroism."
