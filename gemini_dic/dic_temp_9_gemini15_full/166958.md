prestretching: /ˌpriːˈstrɛtʃɪŋ/ | n. |预拉伸；预张紧 | The process of stretching a material or component before its final use or assembly to reduce shrinkage or improve its properties.  It is often used in manufacturing processes to improve the performance and dimensional stability of materials, especially in applications requiring high precision and strength. For example, prestretching is commonly applied to fabrics to prevent wrinkles and shrinkage after washing or to enhance their elasticity.  | Example:  The prestretching of the steel cables before installation was crucial for the bridge's stability.  预先拉伸钢缆对于桥梁的稳定性至关重要。

The prestretching of the fabric improved its drape and reduced shrinkage after washing. 预先拉伸织物改善了其悬垂性和减少了洗涤后的收缩。| 近义词：pre-tensioning, pre-straining | 反义词：relaxation, release
