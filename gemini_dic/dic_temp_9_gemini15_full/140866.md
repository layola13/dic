词源:

The phrase "on-the-pad" is a relatively modern idiom.  "Pad" in this context refers to a notebook or writing tablet, suggesting something easily carried and used.  The "on-" prefix indicates a state of readiness or immediacy.  The exact origin is difficult to pinpoint, but its use likely emerged from the increasing portability of writing tools and the demand for quick note-taking and readily available information.
