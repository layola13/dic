Etymology:

The word "monosyllabical" is derived from the following components:

* **mono-**:  A prefix meaning "one" or "single".  It has Greek origins (monos).
* **syllab-**: A combining form referring to a syllable. This comes from the Greek word "syllabe".
* **-ical**: A suffix forming adjectives, indicating "relating to" or "characterized by".  This also has Greek roots.
