The word "overplenties" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  To get a proper analysis, please provide a valid English word.
