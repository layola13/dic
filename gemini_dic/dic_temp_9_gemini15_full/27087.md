词源:
The word "calice" comes from Old French "calice," ultimately deriving from Late Latin "calix," which in turn comes from classical Latin "calix," meaning "cup" or "goblet."  The Latin word is related to the Greek word "kálux" (κάλυξ), meaning "husk" or "cup-shaped part of a flower," showing a semantic link from the shape of a cup to the shape of a flower part.
