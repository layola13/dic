commutatively:/kəˈmjuːtətɪvli/ | adv. | 交换地；可交换地 |  Adverb describing an operation or property where the order of operands does not affect the result.  For example, addition and multiplication are commutative operations (a + b = b + a; a * b = b * a), while subtraction and division are not. | Example: The elements of the set can be added commutatively.  集合中的元素可以交换地相加。The order of operations is commutatively irrelevant in this case. 在这种情况下，运算顺序与交换无关。|近义词：interchangeably, reversibly | 反义词：irreversibly, non-commutatively | 副词
