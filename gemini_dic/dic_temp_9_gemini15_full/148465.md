词源:
The word "overstrain" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "strain" (meaning "to exert oneself to the utmost,"  "to stretch or tighten something").  Therefore, it literally means "to strain excessively." The word's origins trace back to the Old English word "strengþan," meaning "strength," which evolved into the Middle English "strengthe" and ultimately the modern English "strain."
