词源:
The word's origins are uncertain, but it likely derives from the earlier meaning of "punk" as a term for a prostitute or a young, unsophisticated person.  This itself may have roots in the Middle English word "punken," meaning "to strike or beat," implying a sense of weakness or being easily beaten. Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the rebellious subculture and its associated aesthetic. The shift to its modern meaning likely occurred in the late 20th century with the rise of punk rock music.
