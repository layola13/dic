词源：源自古英语 *frōweard，意为“扭曲的，邪恶的”。  The word's development reflects a shift in meaning from simply "twisted" or "wrong" to its current connotation of stubborn disobedience.  The Old English prefix *frō- likely relates to "away from," and the root *weard may be related to "turn" or "direction," suggesting a turning away from what is expected or desired.
