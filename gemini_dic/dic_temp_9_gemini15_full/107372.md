词源:
The word "lament" comes from the Old French word "lamente," meaning "complaint, wailing."  This in turn derives from the Latin word "lamento," which means "I wail, I lament."  The Latin word is formed from the verb "lamentare," meaning "to wail, to lament," which is related to the adjective "lamentabilis," meaning "lamentable."
