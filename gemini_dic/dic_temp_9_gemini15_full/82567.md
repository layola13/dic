词源:  The word "guarantor" comes from the Old French word "garant," which in turn derives from the Germanic root "warjan," meaning "to protect" or "to defend."  The suffix "-or" indicates the person who performs the action.  The evolution reflects the core function of a guarantor: to protect a creditor from loss.
