词源:
The word "headmaster" is a compound word.  "Head" means chief or principal, and "master" historically referred to a male teacher or person in charge.  Therefore, "headmaster" literally means the chief male teacher or the male principal of a school.  The female equivalent is "headmistress".  The term is gradually being replaced by more gender-neutral terms like "principal" or "head".
