词源：

The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessive") and "lustiness," which itself derives from "lusty" (meaning vigorous, healthy, and full of life).  However, in the context of "overlustiness," "lusty" takes on a more negative connotation, implying excessive and unrestrained sensual pleasure or vitality.  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "lusty" into a noun, denoting the state or quality of being overlusty.  The historical evolution of "lust" reflects a shift in meaning from a general sense of vigor to a more specifically sexual connotation.
