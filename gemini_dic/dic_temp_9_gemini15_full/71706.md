词源:

The word "flavorless" is a combination of "flavor" and the suffix "-less," which indicates a lack of something.  "Flavor" itself has a complex etymology, ultimately deriving from Old French *flavor, related to Latin *sapōr ("taste, savor").  The "-less" suffix is of Germanic origin.


用法说明:

flavorless 主要用作形容词，修饰食物或其他具有味道的事物。它强调缺乏令人愉悦的味道或香味，并非仅仅指没有味道，而是指味道平淡无奇，甚至令人不快。
