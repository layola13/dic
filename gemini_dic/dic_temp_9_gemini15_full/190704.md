sauropterygia:/ˌsɔːrɒpˈtɛəriə/| n. |鳍龙类|Sauropterygia is an extinct clade of mostly aquatic diapsid reptiles that flourished during the Mesozoic Era.  They are characterized by their paddle-like limbs and typically long necks.  Many were carnivorous, feeding on fish and other marine life. |The fossil record shows a wide diversity of sauropterygians, ranging in size from small to very large.|近义词: (No direct synonyms as it's a taxonomic group)|反义词: (No direct antonyms as it's a taxonomic group)
