metadiscoidal: /ˌmɛtədɪsˈkɔɪdəl/ | adj. | 盘状的，似盘状的 | Relating to or resembling a metadiscoid, a type of structure found in some organisms, characterized by a flattened, disc-like shape.  The term is primarily used in biological and geological contexts to describe structures that are somewhat disc-shaped but not perfectly so. | Example: "The fossil showed a metadiscoidal structure, suggesting a previously unknown species." | 近义词: discoidal, disc-shaped, flattened | 反义词: spherical, globular


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The fossil shows a metadiscoidal structure. = 这一化石呈现盘状结构。
The geologist describes the formation as metadiscoidal. = 地质学家将地层描述为盘状的。


一般过去时:
The researchers observed a metadiscoidal pattern in the data. = 研究人员在数据中观察到盘状模式。
The scientist identified the specimen as having a metadiscoidal shape. = 科学家确定标本具有盘状形状。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered many metadiscoidal fossils in this region. = 科学家们在这个区域发现了许多盘状化石。
Researchers have confirmed the metadiscoidal nature of the geological formation. = 研究人员已经证实了该地质构造的盘状性质。


过去完成时:
They had already identified the metadiscoidal structure before publishing the paper. = 他们在发表论文之前就已经确定了盘状结构。
Geologists had previously theorized about the existence of metadiscoidal formations in this area. = 地质学家先前曾推测过该地区存在盘状地层。


将来时:
Future studies will investigate the formation process of these metadiscoidal structures. = 未来研究将调查这些盘状结构的形成过程。
Scientists will likely find more metadiscoidal fossils with further excavation. = 通过进一步挖掘，科学家们可能会发现更多盘状化石。


虚拟语气:
If the structure were perfectly discoidal, it would be easier to classify. = 如果该结构完全是盘状的，则更容易分类。
I wish we had more data on the formation of metadiscoidal structures. = 我希望我们有更多关于盘状结构形成的数据。


被动语态:
The metadiscoidal shape was noted in the initial report. = 初始报告中提到了盘状形状。
The origin of the metadiscoidal structures is still being debated. = 盘状结构的起源仍在争论中。


疑问句:
Is the object metadiscoidal in shape? = 这个物体是盘状的吗？
Are all the fossils in this layer metadiscoidal? = 这一层的所有化石都是盘状的吗？


否定句:
The structure is not perfectly metadiscoidal. = 该结构并非完全盘状。
The data did not support the hypothesis of a metadiscoidal formation. = 数据不支持盘状地层形成的假设。
