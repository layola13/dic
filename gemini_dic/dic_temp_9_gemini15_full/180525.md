The word "reges" is not a standard English word.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a word from another language, or a very obscure or archaic term.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis following your requested format.  To help me assist you, please provide more context:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (e.g., a book, website, conversation)
* **What was the surrounding text?**  This will help determine the intended meaning.
* **What language do you suspect it might be from?** (If not English)

Once I have this information, I can attempt to provide a more accurate analysis.
