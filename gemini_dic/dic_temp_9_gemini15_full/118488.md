词源:

The word "mesmerise" comes from the name of Franz Mesmer (1734-1815), an Austrian physician who developed a system of therapy known as "mesmerism," which involved inducing a trance-like state in patients. Although his methods were later discredited, the term "mesmerise" remains in use to describe the act of captivating or hypnotizing someone.
