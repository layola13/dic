photoheterotroph: /ˌfoʊtoʊˌhɛtəroʊtroʊf/ | n. | 光能异养生物 | An organism that uses light as an energy source but obtains carbon from organic compounds.  These organisms are photosynthetic but unlike photoautotrophs, they cannot use carbon dioxide as their sole carbon source. They require organic molecules like sugars or amino acids. | Example:  Purple non-sulfur bacteria are examples of photoheterotrophs.  紫色非硫细菌是光能异养生物的例子。|近义词: photosynthesizer (in a limited context)|反义词: photoautotroph, chemoautotroph, chemoheterotroph


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in biology and microbiology contexts and does not commonly appear in everyday conversation.  Therefore, demonstrating grammatical tense usage with example sentences isn't practical.  The word itself is a noun and functions as the subject or object of a sentence.


Example sentences:

* **Subject:** The photoheterotroph thrived in the nutrient-rich medium. 光能异养生物在营养丰富的培养基中茁壮成长。
* **Object:**  Researchers are studying the metabolic pathways of this photoheterotroph. 研究人员正在研究这种光能异养生物的代谢途径。
* **Possessive:** The photoheterotroph's growth was inhibited by the presence of oxygen. 光能异养生物的生长受到氧气存在的影响。


PHRASE->
There aren't common idiomatic phrases associated with "photoheterotroph".  The word is highly specific to scientific terminology.  Phrases involving this word would typically be found in scientific papers or textbooks.  For example:

* "The diversity of photoheterotrophs"  光能异养生物的多样性
* "Photoheterotrophic metabolism" 光能异养代谢
* "Cultivation of photoheterotrophs" 光能异养生物的培养
* "Ecological roles of photoheterotrophs" 光能异养生物的生态作用
* "Photoheterotrophic bacteria" 光能异养细菌


WORD ORIGIN->

* **photo-:** from Greek *phōs* (light)
* **hetero-:** from Greek *heteros* (other, different)
* **-troph:** from Greek *trophē* (nourishment)


The word is a combination of three Greek roots, literally meaning "light-other-nourishment,"  reflecting its unique metabolic strategy.
