circumflant:/ˌsɜːrkəmˈflænt/| adj.|环绕的，迂回的 |  This word is extremely rare and largely obsolete. It describes something that is indirect or roundabout in its approach or movement, often suggesting a circuitous or winding path.  It combines the Latin prefix "circum-" (around) with a word related to "flectere" (to bend). There are no common modern synonyms or antonyms as the word itself is practically unused.  | Example: The circumflant path through the forest took much longer than expected. = 森林中蜿蜒的小路比预期的要长很多。|近义词：indirect, roundabout, meandering, circuitous | 反义词：direct, straight, straightforward |
