词源:

The word "impermanency" is derived from the prefix "im-" (meaning "not"), "permanent" (meaning "lasting or enduring"), and the suffix "-ency" (meaning "the state or quality of").  Therefore, it literally means "not being permanent."  The root "permanent" traces back to the Latin word "permanēns," the present participle of "permanēre," meaning "to remain," "to stay," or "to last."
