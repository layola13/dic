词源:
The word "miscarriage" comes from the combination of "mis-" (meaning wrong or bad) and "carriage" (referring to the carrying or bearing of a child).  The original meaning focused on the "wrong" or unsuccessful carrying of a pregnancy, hence "miscarriage".  The extended meaning to refer to the failure of a plan or system developed later.
