rapable: /ˈreɪpəbəl/ | adj. | 可强奸的；易受攻击的 |  Susceptible to being raped; easily victimized or exploited.  The term is highly controversial and its use is strongly discouraged due to its objectification and victim-blaming implications.  It implies a vulnerability that is inherently linked to the victim, rather than acknowledging the perpetrator's responsibility.  |  The word "rapable" is rarely used in formal contexts and is often considered offensive and inappropriate.  There are no appropriate examples of its use. | 近义词：vulnerable, susceptible, exposed (in the sense of being open to attack or exploitation) | 反义词：protected, safe, secure | adj.
