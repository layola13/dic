eulerian:/ˌɔɪˈlɛəriən/| adj.| 欧拉的；欧拉式的 | Relating to or characteristic of Leonhard Euler, a Swiss mathematician, or his work, especially in graph theory.  Eulerian paths and circuits are fundamental concepts in graph theory. | Example:  The problem was solved using an Eulerian circuit.  这个问题用欧拉回路解决了。 | 近义词：graph-theoretical (in the context of graph theory) | 反义词：N/A
