词源:
The word "guilt" originates from the Old English word "gylt," meaning "payment, fine, recompense."  It later evolved to encompass the sense of wrongdoing and its consequences, transitioning from a material payment to a moral or psychological burden.  The modern meaning evolved through the Middle English period, shifting from the concept of a debt or compensation to the feeling of responsibility for wrongdoing.
