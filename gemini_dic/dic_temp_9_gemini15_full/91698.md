hyperconjugation:/ˌhaɪpərˈkɒndʒuɡeɪʃən/| n. |超共轭效应|A stabilizing interaction that occurs when electrons in a sigma bond (usually C-H or C-C) interact with an adjacent empty or partially filled p orbital or pi orbital, resulting in increased stability of the molecule.  This interaction involves the delocalization of electron density from the sigma bond into the adjacent empty or partially filled orbital.  It's a type of resonance effect, but involving sigma electrons instead of pi electrons. |Example: Hyperconjugation is a significant factor in the stability of carbocations. 超共轭效应是碳正离子稳定性的重要因素。|近义词：sigma conjugation, delocalization|反义词：无
