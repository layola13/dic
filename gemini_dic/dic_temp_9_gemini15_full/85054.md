词源:  The word combines "hard" (meaning firm, unyielding) and "bitten" (suggesting the impact of harsh experiences, as if "bitten" by life's difficulties).  The imagery implies a person who has been shaped and hardened by difficult circumstances.  It's not directly traceable to a single etymological root, but rather a figurative combination of existing words to create a new meaning.
