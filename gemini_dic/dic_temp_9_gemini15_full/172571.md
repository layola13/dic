pyromagnetic:/ˌpaɪroʊmæɡˈnɛtɪk/| adj.| 热磁的；由热产生的磁性的 | Relating to or denoting the phenomena of magnetism produced by heat.  Pyromagnetism refers to the magnetic properties of materials that are affected by changes in temperature.  Specifically, it describes the magnetization induced in a material by heating or cooling, often in the absence of an external magnetic field. This effect is distinct from ferromagnetism, which is a permanent magnetic property. | Example: The research explored the pyromagnetic properties of certain rare earth compounds.  研究探索了某些稀土化合物的热磁特性。|近义词：thermomagnetic |反义词：diamagnetic (in the context of response to temperature-induced magnetization)
