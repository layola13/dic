overattenuating: /ˌoʊvərəˈtɛnjuˌeɪtɪŋ/ | adj. | 过度衰减的 | Excessively reducing the amplitude or intensity of a signal or image.  This often refers to a problem in signal processing or image analysis where the processing removes too much detail or information. | The algorithm was overattenuating the high frequencies, resulting in a blurry image. = 该算法过度衰减了高频，导致图像模糊。 The audio signal was overattenuated, making it difficult to hear the quieter parts. = 音频信号过度衰减，导致难以听到较安静的部分。 |  underattenuating | appropriately attenuating |  adj.


USAGE->
This word is primarily used as an adjective describing a state or a process, and therefore doesn't conjugate like a verb.  It doesn't have tenses like the example word "what".  Examples would focus on the context of the overattenuation.

Example sentences illustrating the adjective's use in different contexts:

Declarative:
The overattenuating filter needs adjustment. = 需要调整过度衰减的滤波器。
The image showed signs of overattenuation in the shadows. = 图像显示阴影部分过度衰减的迹象。


Comparative:
The new algorithm is less overattenuating than the old one. = 新算法比旧算法衰减程度更低。
This system is far less overattenuating than its predecessor. = 这个系统比它的前身衰减程度低得多。


Superlative:
This is the most overattenuating filter I've ever seen. = 这是我见过的衰减程度最高的滤波器。
This setting produces the most overattenuated output. = 此设置产生衰减程度最大的输出。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "overattenuating". The usage is primarily technical within fields like signal processing or image analysis.  Instead, phrases related to the *effect* of overattenuation are more common:

loss of detail: Detail loss was significant due to overattenuation. = 由于过度衰减，细节损失很大。
excessive signal reduction: Excessive signal reduction compromised the accuracy of the results. = 过度的信号衰减损害了结果的准确性.
distorted image/signal: The overattenuation resulted in a distorted image/signal. = 过度衰减导致图像/信号失真。
unacceptable artifacts: The processing introduced unacceptable artifacts due to overattenuation. = 由于过度衰减，处理过程引入了不可接受的伪影。
poor signal-to-noise ratio: The poor signal-to-noise ratio indicates overattenuation. = 差的信噪比表明过度衰减。
