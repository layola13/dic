overconstant: /ˌoʊvərˈkɑːnstənt/ | adj. | 过于频繁的；过分不变的 | excessively frequent; excessively unchanging |  This word is not a standard English word and lacks established dictionary entries. It's likely a newly coined word or a rare usage.  Therefore, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage in the same way as for standard words is impossible.  The meaning is inferred from its components: "over" (excessively) and "constant" (unchanging, frequent).


英文解析: The word is formed by combining "over-" (meaning excessively or too much) with "constant" (meaning unchanging or frequently occurring).  Therefore, it implies something that is excessively frequent or unchanging to an undesirable degree.
