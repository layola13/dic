词源:

The word "gizmo" is of uncertain origin, but it's believed to be a clipped form of the word "jigger," which itself is believed to be of uncertain origin, possibly nautical slang.  It likely evolved through informal usage and gained popularity as a playful and slightly vague term for a small mechanical device.  The exact etymology remains debated amongst linguists.
