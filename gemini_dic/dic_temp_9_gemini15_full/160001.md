polyspermy:/ˌpɒliˈspɜːrmi/| n. |多精入卵|The fertilization of an ovum by more than one sperm. This usually results in a non-viable zygote due to an abnormal number of chromosomes.|例句：Polyspermy is a common problem in in vitro fertilization. 多精入卵是体外受精中常见的问题。  The mechanisms preventing polyspermy are crucial for successful fertilization. 防止多精入卵的机制对于成功的受精至关重要。|近义词：multiple fertilization|反义词：monospermy
