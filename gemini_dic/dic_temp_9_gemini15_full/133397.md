/ˌnɒnfækˈtɪʃəsnəsiz/ | n. | 非人为性；非虚构性；非捏造性 | The study focused on establishing the nonfactitiousnesses of the reported events, ensuring they weren't fabricated or imagined.  这项研究的重点是确定所报告事件的非人为性，确保它们不是捏造或想象出来的。 |  genuineness, authenticity | artificiality, fabrication, deception | 名词


USAGE->

This word is extremely rare and doesn't lend itself to typical grammatical examples like "What is your name?".  The word itself is a complex noun, and its usage would be within a sentence demonstrating a lack of artificiality or fabrication.  Examples illustrating typical grammatical tenses are thus not applicable.

Example sentences demonstrating its use:


The court meticulously examined the evidence to confirm the nonfactitiousnesses of the claim.  = 法院仔细审查了证据，以确认索赔的真实性。


The researcher painstakingly documented the nonfactitiousnesses of the data. = 研究人员煞费苦心地记录了数据的真实性。


PHRASE->

Because of the rarity of "nonfactitiousnesses,"  providing common phrases is not meaningful.  The word itself is not typically used in phrasal constructions.
