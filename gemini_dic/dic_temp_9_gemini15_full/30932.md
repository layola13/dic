词源:

The word "chairlift" is a compound word, combining "chair" and "lift".  "Chair" refers to the seat used for transportation, and "lift" indicates the upward movement.  The word's origin is relatively recent, coinciding with the invention and popularization of this type of transportation system in the mid-20th century.  There is no etymological history tracing back to older roots in the same way many older words have.  It is simply a descriptive combination of existing words.
