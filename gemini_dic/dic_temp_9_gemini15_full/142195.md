WORD ORIGIN->
The word "ornatenesses" is derived from the adjective "ornate," which comes from the Old French word "orné," meaning "adorned" or "decorated."  The suffix "-ness" adds the meaning of "state or quality of being."  Therefore, "ornatenesses" refers to the qualities or instances of being ornate.
