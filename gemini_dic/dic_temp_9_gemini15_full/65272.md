词源:
The word "eucharistize" is derived from the Greek word "εὐχαριστία" (eucharistia), meaning "thanksgiving."  It's a relatively modern coinage, formed by adding the verb suffix "-ize" to the root of "eucharist," which itself comes from the Greek word.  Therefore, the word's core meaning is directly linked to the act of giving thanks, particularly within a religious context.
