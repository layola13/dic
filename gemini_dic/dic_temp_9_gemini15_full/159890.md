polymorphism:/ˌpɒliˈmɔːrfɪzəm/| /ˌpɑːliˈmɔːrfɪzəm/ | n. |多态性，多形性 |The ability of a variable, function, or object to take on many forms.  In object-oriented programming, it refers to the ability of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own specific way.  In biology, it refers to the occurrence of different forms in the same species.| 例句：Object-oriented programming relies heavily on polymorphism to achieve code reusability and flexibility. 面向对象编程很大程度上依赖多态性来实现代码的可重用性和灵活性。

In biology, the different forms of a butterfly are an example of polymorphism. 在生物学中，蝴蝶的不同形态是多态性的一个例子。|近义词：versatility, variability, adaptability |反义词：monomorphism, uniformity


USAGE->
There is no verb conjugation for "polymorphism" as it is a noun.  The grammatical usage depends on how it is used in a sentence.  Here are some examples showing different sentence structures:

Simple Sentence:
Polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming. 多态性是面向对象编程中的一个关键概念。
Polymorphism allows for greater code flexibility. 多态性允许更大的代码灵活性。

Complex Sentence:

PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases directly using "polymorphism" as it's a technical term. However, phrases related to its application in programming are common:

run-time polymorphism: 运行时多态性
compile-time polymorphism: 编译时多态性
polymorphic function: 多态函数
polymorphic type: 多态类型
static polymorphism: 静态多态性


WORD ORIGIN->
The word "polymorphism" comes from the Greek words:

* **poly-** (πολύ-) meaning "many"
* **morph-** (μορφή) meaning "form"
* **-ism**  a suffix indicating a doctrine, practice, or condition.

Therefore, the word literally translates to "many forms," reflecting its meaning in both computer science and biology.
