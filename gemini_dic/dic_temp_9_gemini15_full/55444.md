词源:

The word "distinguish" comes from the Old French word "distinguir," which itself is derived from the Latin "distinguere," meaning "to mark off," "to separate," or "to discern."  The Latin word is formed from "dis-" (apart) + "stringere" (to bind, to draw tight).  The original sense was therefore about physically separating or marking something. Over time, the meaning evolved to include the mental act of discerning differences.
