词源:
The word "flimflam" itself is of uncertain origin.  It's likely a combination of onomatopoeic elements suggesting the quick, deceptive nature of the act.  It's a reduplication (repeating a sound or syllable), which often emphasizes a playful or slightly ridiculous aspect, fitting for a word describing a trick or swindle. The earliest recorded uses of the word are in the 19th century.
