saccharometer:/ˌsækəˈrɒmɪtər/ | n. |糖度计|An instrument for measuring the density of a sugar solution, typically by determining the specific gravity.  It's used in industries like brewing, winemaking, and food processing to determine the sugar content of liquids.  | Example: The brewer used a saccharometer to check the sugar concentration in the wort before fermentation.  酿酒师用糖度计检查麦芽汁发酵前的糖浓度。|近义词: hydrometer (for measuring specific gravity)|反义词:  None specifically, but instruments measuring opposite properties (e.g., alcohol content) could be considered contrasting.|名词
