quasi-experimental:/ˈkwɑːziˌɛkspɛrɪˈmɛntəl/| adj.|准实验的；似实验的 |  Relating to or denoting an experiment that does not involve random assignment of participants to conditions but that attempts to control for extraneous variables.  Quasi-experiments are used when true experimental designs are not feasible or ethical. They aim to establish a cause-and-effect relationship but with less control over extraneous variables than in true experiments. |  The study employed a quasi-experimental design to compare the effectiveness of two different teaching methods.  这项研究采用准实验设计来比较两种不同教学方法的有效性。 |  observational, correlational |  true experimental |
