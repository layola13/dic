PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "gelatinity".  The word itself is relatively uncommon and is used more in scientific or technical contexts.  Phrases would be built around describing the gelatinous nature of a substance rather than using "gelatinity" directly.  For example, one might say:

high degree of gelatinity
low gelatinity
consistent gelatinity
change in gelatinity
measurement of gelatinity
