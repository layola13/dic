pleonast: /ˈpliːənæst/ | n. |累赘的词语；冗余表达 | A pleonasm; the use of more words than are necessary to convey meaning.  It often involves redundancy, where the same meaning is expressed more than once.  The use of pleonasm can be stylistic, for emphasis or clarity, or it can be unintentional, resulting in awkward or verbose writing. | Example:  "A pleonasm is a redundant expression of a single idea."  This sentence, ironically, contains a pleonasm because "redundant expression of a single idea" is itself a pleonasm.  | 近义词：redundancy, tautology, superfluity | 反义词：conciseness, brevity |  词性：名词


例句：

The phrase "completely finished" is a pleonasm because "finished" already implies completeness. = 短语“完全完成”是一个累赘的表达，因为“完成”本身就意味着完整。


Using the phrase "ATM machine" is a common pleonasm, as "ATM" already stands for "Automated Teller Machine." = 使用短语“ATM机”是一个常见的累赘表达，因为“ATM”本身就代表“自动取款机”。


词源：

From Greek *pleonasmós*, from *pleon* "more" + *-asmos* "-ism".  The Greek word itself describes a figure of speech involving the use of more words than necessary.


用法说明：

Pleonasm is primarily used as a noun to describe a specific rhetorical device or stylistic choice.  It doesn't have verb or adjective forms in common usage.  However, it's frequently used in discussions of grammar, rhetoric, and writing style to point out instances of unnecessary repetition or redundancy.
