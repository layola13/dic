词源:
From Old French *embresure, from embraser "to set on fire," from Old French en- "in" + braise "embers, glowing coals," from Vulgar Latin *brasa, from Latin bracāria "fire-pan."  The original meaning referred to a recess in a wall where a fire was built, later extending to defensive openings in walls.  The shift in meaning is likely due to the association of fire with warfare and the heat generated by cannon fire.
