overdispersed:/ˌoʊvərˈdɪspɜːrst/ | adj. |过度分散的，超分散的 |  Describes a distribution where the variance is greater than the mean. This often indicates that there is more variability in the data than would be expected under a Poisson or binomial distribution.  The high variance might be due to clustering, heterogeneity, or other factors causing overdispersion. | Example: The distribution of the disease showed overdispersion, suggesting that clustering of cases may be a factor.  疾病的分布显示出过度分散，这表明病例的聚集可能是因素之一。|近义词：highly variable, widely scattered | 反义词：underdispersed, clustered


USAGE->

虚拟语气:
If the data were overdispersed, we would use a negative binomial model. = 如果数据过度分散，我们将使用负二项模型。
It would be helpful if the overdispersion were less significant. = 如果过度分散不那么显著，那就有帮助了。


被动语态:
Overdispersion was observed in the experiment. = 在实验中观察到过度分散。
The overdispersion was addressed by using a generalized linear model. = 通过使用广义线性模型来解决过度分散问题。


疑问句:
Is the data overdispersed? = 数据是否过度分散？

否定句:
The data is not overdispersed. = 数据没有过度分散。
The model did not show significant overdispersion. = 该模型没有显示明显的过度分散。


PHRASE->
overdispersed data = 过度分散的数据
