词源:
The word "long-winded" combines "long" (meaning lengthy) and "winded" (an older word meaning "breathing" or "having breath").  The combination suggests something that takes a long time to breathe through or deliver, implying excessive length and tediousness.  The "winded" part is related to the verb "wind," meaning to twist or turn, suggesting a rambling, convoluted style of speaking or writing.
