词源:
The word "mustier" is the comparative form of the adjective "musty."  "Musty" ultimately derives from the Old French word "moisi," meaning "moldy" or "musty."  This, in turn, is connected to the Latin word "muscus," meaning "moss."  The association is clear:  moss often grows in damp, musty places.

用法说明:
Mustier is used to describe something that has a stale, moldy, or damp smell.  It can describe objects (e.g., a mustier book), places (e.g., a mustier room), or even abstract concepts (e.g., a mustier atmosphere).  The comparative form ("mustier") indicates a greater degree of mustiness compared to something else.  It is generally used in the predicative position (e.g., "The air was mustier") rather than the attributive position (e.g., *"a mustier smell"* is less common than *"a musty smell"*).  The superlative form is "mustiest".
