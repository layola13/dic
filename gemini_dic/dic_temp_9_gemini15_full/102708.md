The word "jangang" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling, a word from another language, or a proper noun (possibly a place name).  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  To provide the requested information, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about its origin and intended use.
