Etymology:

The word "opprobrium" comes from the Late Latin word *opprobrium*, meaning "reproach, disgrace." This, in turn, derives from the Latin verb *opprobrare*, meaning "to reproach," which is formed from the prefix *ob-* ("against") and *probrare* ("to upbraid").  The ultimate root is likely connected to the Proto-Indo-European root *per-*, meaning "to strike, hit," hinting at the forceful nature of reproach.
