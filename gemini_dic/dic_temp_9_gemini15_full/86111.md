词源:
The word "heartbreaking" is a compound word.  It combines "heart" (referring to emotions and feelings) and "breaking" (implying a shattering or destruction of something precious). The combination creates a vivid image of something causing profound emotional pain, like breaking one's heart.  The word's origins trace back to the individual words' Old English and Proto-Germanic roots, reflecting the long-standing association of the heart with emotions.
