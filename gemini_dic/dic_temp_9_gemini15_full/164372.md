The word "preemotions" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism (a newly coined word or expression).  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and standard usage examples are impossible to provide.  To analyze it, we need to break down the word's apparent construction:


/ˌpriːɪˈmoʊʃənz/ | n. | 预感，先兆情绪 | A hypothesized emotional state preceding a fully formed emotion;  a nascent or precursory feeling.  | Example: She felt a wave of preemotions – a vague sense of unease before the bad news arrived. | 近义词: presentiments, forebodings, premonitions | 反义词:  (lack of) certainty, calmness
