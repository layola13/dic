词源:  The word "incastelled" is a relatively modern formation. It combines the prefix "in-" (meaning "in" or "into") with the noun "castle," suggesting something resembling or having the qualities of a castle, particularly in terms of its defensive features.  The "-ed" suffix transforms the word into an adjective, indicating a state or condition.
