词源:
The word "presuming" comes from the Old French word "presumer," which in turn derives from the Latin "praesumere."  "Praesumere" is a compound of "prae," meaning "before," and "sumere," meaning "to take."  Therefore, the root meaning points to "taking something beforehand" or "assuming something before it is proven."
