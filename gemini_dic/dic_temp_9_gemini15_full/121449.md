词源:
The word "misinterpreters" is formed by combining the prefix "mis-" (meaning wrongly or badly), the verb "interpret" (to explain, translate, or understand the meaning of something), and the suffix "-ers" (indicating a person who performs the action).  Therefore, it literally means "people who wrongly interpret."  The root of "interpret" can be traced back to the Latin "interpretari," meaning "to explain" or "to translate."
