microlepidoptera:/ˌmaɪkroʊˌlɛpɪˈdɒptərə/| n. |微鳞翅目昆虫|MicroLepidoptera refers to a large and diverse group of moths, generally smaller than the Macrolepidoptera (larger moths and butterflies). They are characterized by their relatively small size and often inconspicuous appearance.  The classification is based on morphological characteristics such as wing venation, larval features, and adult structures.  Many species are economically important as pests, while others play crucial roles in ecosystems as pollinators or food sources for other animals. |Example:  Many species of microlepidoptera are difficult to identify without microscopic examination of their genitalia.  许多微鳞翅目昆虫如果不通过显微镜检查它们的生殖器就很难鉴定。|近义词：small moths (非正式)|反义词：Macrolepidoptera
