词源：
* **pseudo-:**  From Greek *pseudes* meaning "false," "lying," or "counterfeit." This prefix is commonly used to indicate something that is false or imitation.
* **economical:** From Greek *oikonomikos*, from *oikos* ("house") + *nemein* ("to manage").  This refers to the efficient management of resources.

Therefore, "pseudoeconomical" literally means "falsely economical."
