The word "outate" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specific jargon or dialect.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we would need clarification on its intended meaning and context.
