词源:
The word "convenor" is derived from the verb "convene," meaning "to come together," "to assemble," or "to call together."  The suffix "-or" indicates the agent or doer of the action.  Ultimately, "convene" traces back to the Latin word "con," meaning "together," and "venire," meaning "to come."
