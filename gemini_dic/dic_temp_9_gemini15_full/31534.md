词源:

The word "chartered" comes from the Old French word "charter," meaning "a written document granting privileges," which itself derives from the Latin word "carta," meaning "paper" or "document."  The meaning evolved to include the granting of privileges to specific individuals or organizations, leading to the modern usage of "chartered" in relation to licensed businesses, chartered flights, and so on.
