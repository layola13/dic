/ˌsuːdəʊˌæpəʊzəˈmætɪk/ | adj. |拟态警戒色；伪警戒色 |  Relating to or characteristic of pseudaposematism, the mimicry by a palatable or harmless species of the warning signals of an unpalatable or dangerous species.  This is a form of mimicry where a harmless species evolves to resemble a harmful one to deter predators.  | Example: The viceroy butterfly exhibits pseudaposematic coloration, mimicking the poisonous monarch butterfly to avoid predation.  | 近义词: mimicry, protective resemblance | 反义词: aposematism (true warning coloration)


USAGE->

They had already documented several instances of pseudaposematic behavior in the region. = 他们已经在该地区记录了几起伪警戒行为的案例。


将来时:
Scientists will continue to study pseudaposematic adaptations in various species. = 科学家们将继续研究各种物种的伪警戒适应性。
Further research will clarify the evolutionary mechanisms of pseudaposematic mimicry. = 进一步的研究将阐明伪警戒拟态的进化机制。


虚拟语气:
If the prey were more easily identifiable, predators would not be fooled by pseudaposematic mimicry. = 如果猎物更容易识别，捕食者就不会被伪警戒色所欺骗。

疑问句:
Does this species utilize pseudaposematic strategies? = 这个物种是否使用了伪警戒策略？
How effective is pseudaposematic coloration in deterring predators? = 伪警戒色在阻止捕食者方面有多有效？


否定句:
This butterfly does not exhibit true aposematism; its coloration is pseudaposematic. = 这只蝴蝶没有表现出真正的警戒色；它的颜色是伪警戒色。
The observed patterns were not considered to be examples of pseudaposematic mimicry. = 观察到的模式不被认为是伪警戒拟态的例子。
