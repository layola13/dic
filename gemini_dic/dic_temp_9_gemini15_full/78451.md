The word "geth" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling: Perhaps you meant a different word? Please double-check the spelling.
* It's a slang term or jargon:  If it's specific to a certain community or field, more context is needed.
* It's a newly coined word: If it's a very recent invention, it won't yet be in dictionaries.

If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, the surrounding sentence, etc.), I can try to help you figure out what it might be.
