overdomesticating: /ˌoʊvərdoʊˈmɛstɪkeɪtɪŋ/ | v. |过度驯化；过度家养|  The act of excessively domesticating an animal or plant, leading to negative consequences.  It refers to the process of breeding animals or cultivating plants to the point where they become overly reliant on human intervention and lose some of their natural traits or resilience. This can result in reduced genetic diversity, increased susceptibility to diseases, and a decreased ability to survive in the wild.
