词源:
The word "chokey" is derived from the verb "choke," meaning to have difficulty breathing because of something blocking the airway.  It's a descriptive adjective formed by adding the suffix "-y," which often creates adjectives indicating a quality or characteristic.  The root ultimately goes back to the Old English word "ceocan," meaning "to choke."
