pseudoneuropterous:/ˌsjuːdoʊnʊˈrɒptərəs/ | adj. | 假神经翅目的；貌似神经翅目的 |  Relating to or characteristic of insects that superficially resemble neuropterans (members of the order Neuroptera, such as lacewings and antlions) but belong to a different order. This resemblance is often due to convergent evolution, where unrelated species develop similar traits due to similar environmental pressures.  | Example: Some species of Lepidoptera exhibit pseudoneuropterous wing venation, mimicking the delicate network of veins found in true neuropterans.  一些鳞翅目物种表现出假神经翅目的翅脉，模仿了真正神经翅目昆虫中精细的翅脉网络。| 近义词:  Apparently neuropterous, superficially neuropteroid | 反义词:  Truly neuropterous
