词源:
The word "inclined" comes from the Old French word "encliner," meaning "to bend, to lean."  This in turn derives from the Latin word "inclinare," which combines the prefix "in-" (into) and "clinare" (to bend).  The "-ed" suffix transforms the verb into an adjective, indicating a state of being bent or leaning towards something.  The "to" is a preposition indicating direction or purpose.
