The word "integrality" refers to the state or quality of being integral;  the condition of being complete or undivided. It emphasizes the importance of all parts working together to form a unified whole.  It suggests a sense of unity and coherence, where the removal of any part would diminish the value or function of the whole.


词源:

The word "integrality" is derived from the Latin word "integer," meaning "whole," "untouched," or "complete."  The suffix "-ality" is used to form nouns of quality or state.  Therefore, "integrality" literally means "the state of being whole."
