词源:
The word "digladiate" is derived from the Latin words "dis-" (meaning "apart" or "asunder") and "gladius" (meaning "sword").  Therefore, its literal meaning is "to fight with swords," suggesting a fierce and intense conflict.  The modern usage retains this sense of strong, often verbal, contention.
