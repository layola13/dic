The word "iyasu" is not a standard English word.  It's possible it's a name, a word from another language (perhaps a variation of a name), or a misspelling.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  To get a proper analysis, please provide the correct spelling or context in which you encountered this word.
