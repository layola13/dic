词源:
The word "noncorrupt" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "corrupt."  "Corrupt" originates from the Latin word "corruptus," the past participle of "corrumpere," meaning "to break," "to destroy," or "to spoil."  Therefore, "noncorrupt" literally means "not broken," "not destroyed," or "not spoiled" in the moral sense, indicating an absence of dishonesty or bribery.
