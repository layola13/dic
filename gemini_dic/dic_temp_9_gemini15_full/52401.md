词源:
The origin of "diddle" is uncertain, but it likely arose in the 18th century as a playful or informal term.  The earliest recorded uses connect it to the sense of "to trick or deceive," possibly related to onomatopoeia suggesting a light, quick, deceitful movement.  Its association with playing music casually emerged later.
