词源:

The word "fawnest" is the superlative form of the adjective "fawning."  "Fawning" comes from the Old English word "fāwan," meaning "to fawn," which originally referred to the behavior of a young deer.  This behavior, characterized by gentle, submissive actions, came to be associated with excessive flattery and subservience in humans.  Therefore, the transition in meaning from the behavior of a deer to human behavior reflects a metaphorical extension.
