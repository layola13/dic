USAGE->
This word is rare and its usage is limited to academic or highly formal contexts.  As such, demonstrating its usage across various tenses is impractical and unnatural.  The word's function is primarily descriptive, within the context of a sentence describing multiple instances of something lacking substance.  There's no natural progression across tenses.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "nonsubstantialnesses".  The word itself is too rare and specific for common phrasal usage.  However, phrases using related words could include:

a lack of substantiality
a series of trivialities
many insignificances
a collection of unimportances
the ephemerality of things


WORD ORIGIN->

* **non-**:  Prefix meaning "not" or "lacking."
* **substantial**: Adjective meaning "of considerable importance, value, or worth;  having a firm basis in reality."  Derived from the Latin *substantia* meaning "substance, essence."
* **-ness**: Suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.  (e.g., happiness, sadness)
* **-es**: Plural suffix for nouns ending in -s.


Therefore, "nonsubstantialnesses" literally means "the multiple states or qualities of lacking substance or importance."
