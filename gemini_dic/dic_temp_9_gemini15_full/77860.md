The word "genetic" is not correctly spelled.  The correct spelling is "genetic".  I will proceed with an analysis of "genetic".


genetic: /dʒəˈnɛtɪk/ | adj. | 基因的；遗传的 | Relating to genes or heredity.  Genetics is the study of genes, heredity, and variation in living organisms.  The term encompasses a broad range of topics, including the structure and function of genes, how genes are inherited, and how genetic variation arises and is maintained within populations.


例句：

He has a genetic predisposition to heart disease. = 他有心脏病的遗传倾向。

The genetic code determines the characteristics of an organism. = 遗传密码决定了生物体的特性。


近义词：hereditary, inherited

反义词：acquired, environmental


词性：形容词

genetic mutation = 基因突变

genetic modification = 基因修饰


词源:

The word "genetic" is derived from the Greek word "genesis" (γένεσις), meaning "origin," "birth," or "creation."  The suffix "-ic" is added to form an adjective.  The word entered English in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, reflecting the growing understanding of heredity and the role of genes in inheritance.
