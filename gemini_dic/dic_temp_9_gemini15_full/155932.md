photodissociation:/ˌfoʊtoʊdɪˌsoʊsiˈeɪʃən/ | n. |光致离解|The process in which a molecule is broken down into smaller molecules, atoms, or ions by the absorption of light.  This process is crucial in many atmospheric and astrophysical phenomena. |Example:  Photodissociation of ozone in the stratosphere helps to protect life on Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation.  光致离解平流层中的臭氧有助于保护地球上的生命免受有害的紫外线辐射。|近义词：photodecomposition|反义词：photoassociation|词性：名词
