词源:

The word "covetiveness" is derived from the Middle English word "coveitous," meaning "greedy" or "avaricious."  This, in turn, comes from the Old French word "coveitouse," which is derived from the Latin word "concupiscere," meaning "to desire eagerly" or "to lust after."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, indicating a state or quality.
