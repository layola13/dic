PHRASE->
(Hypersomnolently doesn't naturally combine with other words to form common phrases.  Its usage is largely standalone.)

词源:
The word is formed from:
* hyper- (prefix):  meaning "over," "excessive," or "beyond."
* somnolent (adjective): meaning "sleepy," "drowsy."
* -ly (suffix):  forming an adverb.

Therefore, hypersomnolently means "excessively sleepily."
