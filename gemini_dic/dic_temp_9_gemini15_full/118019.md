词源:

The word "memory" comes from the Old French word "memórie," which in turn comes from the Latin word "memoria."  The Latin word is related to the verb "memorāri," meaning "to be mindful," "to remember," or "to commemorate."  The root is likely Proto-Indo-European "*mer-*," meaning "to think" or "to remember."
