mezzotint:/ˈmɛzəˌtɪnt/| n. |凹版印刷术；凹版画|A mezzotint is a type of printmaking process that produces rich, velvety tones by using a rocker to roughen a copper plate.  The resulting texture holds ink differently, allowing for a wide range of tonal values, from very dark to very light.  It’s known for its ability to create smooth gradations of tone and deep blacks, making it particularly suitable for reproducing paintings with subtle shading. |The artist created a stunning mezzotint of a stormy seascape.  艺术家创作了一幅令人惊叹的海景凹版画。|intaglio, etching (partially)| relief printing, woodcut|名词
