词源:

The word "highfalutin" is of American origin, emerging in the 19th century.  Its etymology is uncertain, but it's widely believed to be a combination of "highfaluting" (itself an earlier variant),  "high-flown" (meaning lofty or pretentious), and possibly elements suggesting "falsify" or "falsetto" (implying artificiality or insincerity). The exact combination and evolution are debated among etymologists, but the overall sense of pretentiousness and inflated language is consistent.
