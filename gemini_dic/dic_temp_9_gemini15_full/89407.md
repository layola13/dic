homotaxic: /ˌhoʊmoʊˈtæksɪk/ | adj. | 同时期的；同层位的 |

英文解析:  In geology, homotaxic refers to rock strata (layers of rock) that were formed during the same geologic time period, even if they are geographically separated and may consist of different rock types.  It emphasizes the contemporaneity of formation, regardless of lithological differences.  The term contrasts with isochronous, which implies formation at precisely the same time.

例句:

The limestone formations in England and the shale formations in North America are homotaxic, indicating they were deposited during the same geological epoch.  = 英格兰的石灰岩地层和北美的页岩地层是同时期的，这表明它们是在同一地质时期沉积的。


These geographically distant rock units, though differing in lithology, are considered homotaxic based on their fossil content. = 尽管这些地理位置遥远的岩层在岩性上有所不同，但基于它们的化石含量，它们被认为是同时期的。


近义词: contemporaneous, synchronous (although "synchronous" implies a stricter simultaneity)

反义词: diachronous (referring to different time periods)


词性:形容词
