词源：

The word "impertinence" comes from the Old French word "impertinence," which itself derives from the Latin "impertinens," meaning "inappropriate" or "irrelevant."  The prefix "im-" means "not," while "pertinens" means "pertaining" or "relevant."  Thus, the original meaning implied something not relevant or appropriate, which evolved to encompass the modern sense of rudeness and disrespect.
