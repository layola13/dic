precollapsibility:/ˌpriːkəˈlæpsəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 预先塌陷性；预先崩塌可能性 | The tendency of a material or structure to collapse before the application of a full load.  This term often refers to the potential for a structure, especially in geotechnical engineering or mining, to fail under its own weight or due to internal stresses before external loads are fully applied.  | Example: The precollapsibility of the unsupported mine shaft was a major concern.  预先塌陷性对未支撑的矿井竖井是一个主要问题。 |近义词: instability, vulnerability, susceptibility |反义词: stability, strength, resilience |
