词源:
The word "horseradish" comes from the Old English "hors" (horse) and "redish" (radish).  The "horse" part is believed to refer to its strong, pungent smell and taste, possibly indicating a strength exceeding that of a common radish.  The name doesn't directly imply any relationship between the plant and horses.
