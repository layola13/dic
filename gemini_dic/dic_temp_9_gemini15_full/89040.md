holoblast:/ˈhɒləʊblæst/ | n. | 全裂卵 | A holoblast is a type of egg in which cleavage (cell division) occurs throughout the entire egg, resulting in a complete division of the yolk.  This is in contrast to meroblastic cleavage, where cleavage is partial and only occurs in a portion of the egg.  Holoblastic cleavage is characteristic of eggs with a relatively small amount of yolk, such as those of many mammals and echinoderms. | Example:  "The sea urchin egg undergoes holoblastic cleavage." = 海胆卵进行全裂卵分裂。  The frog egg displays holoblastic cleavage, although it is unequal due to the presence of yolk. = 蛙卵展现全裂卵分裂，尽管由于卵黄的存在而不均匀。| 近义词: complete cleavage | 反义词: meroblastic cleavage |  n.
