词源:
The term "larrikin" itself is of uncertain origin, but its widespread use in Australia dates back to the late 19th century.  Several theories exist about its etymology, some suggesting possible links to Irish slang or Aboriginal words.  Regardless of its precise origins, "larrikin" quickly became associated with a particular type of Australian youth culture characterized by rebelliousness, nonconformity, and a certain disregard for societal norms.  "Larrikinisms" simply adds the suffix "-isms" to create a plural form, referring to the collective behaviors and attitudes associated with larrikins.
