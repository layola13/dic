photoreceptor:/ˈfoʊtoʊrɪˌsɛptər/ | n. |感光器，感光细胞 | A specialized cell or nerve ending that responds to light. Photoreceptors are found in the retina of the eye and are responsible for vision.  | Example: Rods and cones are photoreceptors in the human eye.  视杆细胞和视锥细胞是人眼中的感光器。 |近义词: photosensor, light receptor |反义词: None.


USAGE->

将来时:
Scientists will further investigate the photoreceptor's mechanism. = 科学家将进一步研究感光器的机制。
Improved photoreceptors will enhance vision technology. = 改进的感光器将增强视觉技术。


虚拟语气:
If the photoreceptor were damaged, vision would be impaired. = 如果感光器受损，视力就会下降。
I wish the photoreceptor's response was faster. = 我希望感光器的反应更快。


被动语态:
Light is detected by the photoreceptor. = 光线由感光器检测。
The photoreceptor's activity was monitored closely. = 感光器的活动受到密切监控。


疑问句:
How many photoreceptors are in the human eye? = 人眼有多少感光细胞？
