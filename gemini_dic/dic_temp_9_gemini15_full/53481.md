词源:

The word "disarranging" is formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") to the word "arranging."  "Arranging" comes from the Old French word "arranger," which itself has roots in the Latin word "arrigare," meaning "to make straight, to prepare."  Therefore, "disarranging" literally means "to make not straight," or "to put into disorder."
