词源:
From Middle English *proselyten, from Old French proselite, from Late Latin prosēlytus, from Greek prosēlytos, from pros- ("to," "towards") + ēlytos ("come," "arrived").  The original Greek word referred to someone who had come from another place, and later took on the religious meaning of a convert.
