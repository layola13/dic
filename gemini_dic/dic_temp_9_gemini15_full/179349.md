词源:

The word "redound" comes from the Old French word "redonder," meaning "to overflow, to abound."  It ultimately derives from the Latin word "redundare," which also means "to overflow, to be abundant."  The modern English meaning reflects this original sense of overflowing, but in a figurative sense – overflowing with benefit or consequence.
