词源:
The word "lacrosse" is derived from the French word "crosse," meaning "crook" or "stick."  The game's origins are in Indigenous cultures of North America, who played various forms of stick and ball games for centuries. The French colonists adopted and named the game, with the name evolving into "lacrosse" over time.  Different Indigenous groups had their own variations of the game with differing rules and equipment.
