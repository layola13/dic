词源:

The word "oxyacetylene" is a compound word formed from:

* **oxy-**:  A combining form meaning "oxygen," derived from the Greek word  ὀξύς (oxys) meaning "sharp," "acid," or "pointed," referring to the sharp, pungent smell and acidic properties of oxygen.

* **acetylene**:  This refers to the hydrocarbon gas acetylene (C₂H₂).  The name likely derives from its discovery and synthesis methods. Although the precise etymology is complex, it's related to the chemical structure and its formation from elements like carbon and hydrogen.  The "-ene" suffix indicates an unsaturated hydrocarbon.
