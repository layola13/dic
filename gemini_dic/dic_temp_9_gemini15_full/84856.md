词源:

The word "hangdog" originates from the Old English word "hangdogge," which literally meant "a dog that is hanged."  Historically, dogs were sometimes hanged as punishment (or even simply killed) for various offenses, such as killing livestock. Over time, the image of a hanged dog – defeated, miserable, and dejected – became associated with a general feeling of dejection and shame in humans.  The association isn't explicitly about being literally hanged; rather, it's the visual and emotional state of the hanged animal that transferred to the human context.  The word evolved to describe people displaying similar physical posture and emotional state.
