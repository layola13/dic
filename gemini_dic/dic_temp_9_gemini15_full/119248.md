micella:/mɪˈsɛlə/| n.|胶束|A micelle is a spherical aggregate of surfactant molecules dispersed in a liquid colloid.  The molecules arrange themselves in a way that their hydrophobic tails are pointing inward, away from the surrounding water, while their hydrophilic heads are pointing outward, interacting with the water. This structure allows for the solubilization of hydrophobic substances in water.  |Example:  The detergent molecules formed micelles in the water, effectively cleaning the soiled clothes.  胶束在水中形成，有效地清洁了脏衣服。|近义词：aggregate, cluster|反义词：N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Micelles form spontaneously in aqueous solutions above the critical micelle concentration. = 胶束在高于临界胶束浓度的水溶液中自发形成。
The detergent molecules create micelles to encapsulate grease. = 洗涤剂分子形成胶束以包裹油脂。


一般过去时:
The researchers observed the formation of micelles under the microscope. = 研究人员在显微镜下观察到胶束的形成。
The micelles broke down when the solution was diluted. = 当溶液被稀释时，胶束分解了。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied micelles for many decades. = 科学家们已经研究胶束几十年了。
Researchers have determined the factors influencing micelle size. = 研究人员已经确定了影响胶束大小的因素。


过去完成时:
The experiment had already begun before the micelles had fully formed. = 在胶束完全形成之前，实验就已经开始了。
They had investigated the properties of micelles before publishing their findings. = 他们在发表研究结果之前已经研究了胶束的特性。


将来时:
We will analyze the micelle structure using advanced imaging techniques. = 我们将使用先进的成像技术分析胶束结构。
Future research will focus on the applications of micelles in drug delivery. = 未来的研究将集中在胶束在药物递送中的应用。


虚拟语气:
If the concentration were higher, more micelles would form. = 如果浓度更高，将形成更多的胶束。
I wish I had understood the dynamics of micelle formation earlier. = 我希望我早些时候就理解了胶束形成的动力学。


被动语态:
Micelles are often used in drug delivery systems. = 胶束经常用于药物递送系统。
The size of the micelles was determined by dynamic light scattering. = 胶束的大小由动态光散射法测定。


疑问句:
What factors determine the size and shape of micelles? = 哪些因素决定了胶束的大小和形状？
How are micelles used in the cosmetic industry? = 胶束在化妆品行业如何使用？


否定句:
The solution did not contain enough surfactant to form micelles. = 该溶液不含形成胶束的足够表面活性剂。
Micelles were not observed in the control experiment. = 在对照实验中没有观察到胶束。


PHRASE->
critical micelle concentration (CMC) 临界胶束浓度
micelle formation 胶束形成
reverse micelle 反胶束
micellar solution 胶束溶液
