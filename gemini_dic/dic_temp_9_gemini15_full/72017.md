词源:
The word "flip-flapped" is a relatively informal and modern formation. It's a reduplication (repetition) of "flip," which itself can mean to move or turn suddenly or to become excited or agitated.  The addition of "-flapped" intensifies the sense of nervous energy and rapid, erratic movement.  There isn't a direct etymological root tracing back to older words in a traditional sense, but rather a more recent, expressive combination.
