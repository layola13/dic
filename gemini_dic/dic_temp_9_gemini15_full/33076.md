The word "chria" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* **It's a technical term:** It might be a term from a specific field (e.g., medicine, a particular dialect, or a very specialized area of study). If you can provide context where you encountered this word, it might help determine its meaning.
* **It's a neologism:** It might be a newly coined word not yet widely recognized.
