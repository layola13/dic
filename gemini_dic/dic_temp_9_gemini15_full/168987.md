词源:  From Middle English *profligat, from Old French *profligat, from Latin *profligatus, past participle of profligare ("to dash down, overthrow, ruin"), from pro- ("forward") + fligere ("to strike").  The original meaning was more focused on "ruin" or "destruction," but the meaning shifted over time to encompass the wasteful behavior that often leads to ruin.
