polymerizes:/ˈpɑːlɪməraɪzɪz/| v.|聚合；聚合反应|To combine (simple molecules) to form a polymer.  The process involves the joining of many small molecules (monomers) to form a much larger molecule (polymer).|

例句：

The monomers polymerize to form a long chain. 单体聚合形成长链。

The styrene polymerizes readily under the influence of heat. 苯乙烯在热的作用下容易聚合。
