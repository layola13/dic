The word "palesie" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a neologism or technical term:**  It might be a newly coined word, a slang term, or specific to a particular field (e.g., medicine, technology). If you can provide context where you encountered this word, it might help determine its meaning.
* **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into English.  If you can specify the language of origin, it might be possible to provide a translation and analysis.
