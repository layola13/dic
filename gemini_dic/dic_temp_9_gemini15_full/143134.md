词源:

The word "outcasting" is formed from the verb "outcast" + "-ing" (present participle/gerund suffix).  "Outcast" itself is a compound word combining "out" (away from) and "cast" (to throw or expel).  Its roots trace back to Old English, with "out" having Germanic origins and "cast" related to Proto-Germanic and Proto-Indo-European roots connected to throwing or projecting.  Therefore, the word's core meaning reflects the act of forcefully removing or expelling someone from a group.
