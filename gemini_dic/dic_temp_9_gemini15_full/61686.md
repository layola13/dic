词源:
The word "emo" is a shortened form of "emotional," which itself originates from the late Middle English word "emotional," deriving from the Old French word "emotioun," ultimately from the Latin word "emovere" meaning "to move out, stir up."  The modern usage of "emo" as a descriptor of a subculture evolved in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
