词源:

The word "embedded" comes from the verb "embed," which itself comes from the Old English "embeodan," meaning "to command," "to enjoin," or "to entrust." Over time, the meaning shifted to "to fix firmly in a surrounding mass," giving rise to the modern meaning of "embedded."  The prefix "em-" indicates enclosure or envelopment, while the root "-bed" relates to the idea of being fixed or placed.
