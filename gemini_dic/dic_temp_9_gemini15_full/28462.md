carburization:/ˌkɑːrbəraɪˈzeɪʃən/| n. |渗碳；渗碳处理 |The process of increasing the carbon content of a metal, typically steel, by heating it in a carbon-rich environment.  This process is used to harden the surface of steel, making it more resistant to wear and tear. |Example: Carburization is a crucial step in the manufacturing of many high-strength steel components. 渗碳是许多高强度钢部件制造中的一个关键步骤。|近义词：carbonizing, case hardening|反义词：decarburization
