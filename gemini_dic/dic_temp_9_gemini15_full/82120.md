词源:
The word "grogshop" is a compound word combining "grog" and "shop".  "Grog" itself derives from the nickname of Admiral Edward Vernon, who in the 18th century introduced a diluted rum ration for British sailors.  This rum and water mixture became known as "grog," and thus, places selling this drink became known as "grogshops".  The "-shop" suffix simply indicates a place of business.
