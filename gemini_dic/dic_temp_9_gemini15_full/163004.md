词源:

The word derives from the adjective "precise," which comes from the Latin word "praecisus," the past participle of "praecidere," meaning "to cut off," "to cut short," or "to determine exactly."  The suffix "-ness" forms a noun indicating a quality or state, and the addition of "-es" makes it plural.
