词源:
From Middle English *portly, from Old French *port, meaning "bearing, carriage, demeanor," ultimately from Latin *portus, "port, harbor."  The sense shifted from "bearing" to "dignified bearing" then to "stoutness"  due to the association of a strong, dignified bearing with physical size and strength.
