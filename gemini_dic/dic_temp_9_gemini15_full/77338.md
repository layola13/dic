词源:  The word "gaucherie" comes from the French word "gauche," meaning "left," "awkward," or "clumsy."  This is likely due to the historical association of the left hand with being less skilled or less refined than the right. The suffix "-erie" adds the sense of a characteristic or quality.  Thus, "gaucherie" literally means "the quality of being left-handed" (in the metaphorical sense of being clumsy or awkward).
