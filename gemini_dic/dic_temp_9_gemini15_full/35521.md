WORD ORIGIN->

The word "coagulabilities" is derived from the verb "coagulate," which comes from the Latin word "coagulare," meaning "to curdle" or "to thicken."  The suffix "-abilities" indicates the state or capacity of being able to coagulate.  Therefore, "coagulabilities" refers to the inherent properties or capabilities of a substance to undergo coagulation.
