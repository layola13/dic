词源：

The word "eyepieces" is a compound word.  "Eye" refers to the organ of sight, and "pieces" refers to the parts or components.  Therefore, "eyepieces" literally means the parts related to the eye used for viewing.  The etymology of "eye" traces back to Old English "ēage," and "pieces" comes from Old French "piece," ultimately from Latin "pēda," meaning a piece or foot.
