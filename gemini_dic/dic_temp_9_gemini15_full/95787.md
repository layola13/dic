词源:

The word "incontrovertible" comes from the prefix "in-" (not), the verb "controvert" (to dispute or oppose), and the suffix "-ible" (capable of).  Therefore, it literally means "not capable of being disputed."  The verb "controvert" itself originates from the Latin "controvertere," meaning "to turn against," a combination of "contra" (against) and "vertere" (to turn).
