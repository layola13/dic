cyclograph:/ˈsaɪkləɡræf/| n. |循环图；周期图 |A cyclograph is a graphical representation of cyclical or repetitive processes, often used in engineering and science to visualize periodic motion or variations. It typically shows the relationship between two or more variables over a cycle.  |Example: The engineer used a cyclograph to analyze the cyclical stress on the engine component.  工程师用循环图来分析发动机部件上的周期性应力。|近义词：cycle diagram, periodic chart |反义词：N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The cyclograph shows the engine's performance. = 循环图显示了发动机的性能。
This cyclograph illustrates the data clearly. = 这张循环图清晰地说明了数据。


一般过去时:
The cyclograph displayed the previous cycle's data. = 循环图显示了上一周期的数据。
The researchers analyzed the cyclograph from the experiment. = 研究人员分析了实验中的循环图。


现在完成时:
The team has completed the cyclograph for the project. = 团队已经完成了项目的循环图。
Scientists have used cyclographs for decades to study various phenomena. = 科学家们几十年来一直使用循环图来研究各种现象。


过去完成时:
They had already finished the cyclograph before the presentation. = 他们在演示之前就已经完成了循环图。
The engineers had reviewed the cyclograph multiple times before making a decision. = 工程师们在做出决定之前多次审查了循环图。


将来时:
We will create a cyclograph to visualize the results. = 我们将创建一个循环图来可视化结果。
The software will automatically generate a cyclograph based on the input data. = 该软件将根据输入数据自动生成循环图。


虚拟语气:
If we had a cyclograph, we could analyze the data more efficiently. = 如果我们有循环图，我们可以更有效地分析数据。
It is essential that the cyclograph accurately represent the cyclical process. = 循环图必须准确地表示循环过程。


被动语态:
The cyclograph was created using specialized software. = 循环图是使用专用软件创建的。
The data was presented in a clear cyclograph. = 数据在一个清晰的循环图中呈现。


疑问句:
What does this cyclograph represent? = 这个循环图代表什么？
Is this cyclograph accurate? = 这个循环图准确吗？


否定句:
The cyclograph did not show any significant variations. = 循环图没有显示任何明显的变化。
This is not the correct cyclograph for this experiment. = 这不是这个实验正确的循环图。


PHRASE->
cyclograph analysis = 循环图分析
generate a cyclograph = 生成循环图
interpret a cyclograph = 解读循环图
construct a cyclograph = 建立循环图
detailed cyclograph = 详细的循环图
