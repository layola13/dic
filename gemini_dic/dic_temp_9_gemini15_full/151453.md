The parooephoron is a small structure located near the ovary in females.  It's a remnant of the Wolffian duct, a structure that plays a significant role in male reproductive development.  In females, this duct largely regresses during development, leaving behind small remnants such as the parooephoron.  Its presence is considered normal and usually doesn't cause any medical issues. | 近义词：Epoophoron (similar vestigial structure) | 反义词：N/A (no true antonym, as it describes a specific anatomical structure) | 词性: 名词
