septifarious: /ˌsɛptɪˈfɛəriəs/ | adj. |七种的；七部分的 | Having seven parts or varieties.  The word is rare and largely obsolete, found primarily in older texts. It is formed from the Latin elements "septi-" (seven) and "-farious" (various, diverse).  There are no readily available contemporary examples of this word's usage in common contexts.


近义词: heptapartite (more common and modern equivalent), sevenfold


反义词:  There isn't a direct antonym, but words suggesting a lack of multiplicity, such as "single," "uniform," or "undivided," could be considered contextual opposites.
