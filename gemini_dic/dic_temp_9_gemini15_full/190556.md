词源:  From "satire" + "-ization",  "satire" ultimately derives from the Latin word *satura*, meaning "a medley," "miscellaneous dish," or "a dish of mixed fruits."  The Roman poet Horace used *satura* to refer to a literary genre combining various elements,  and this evolved into the modern meaning of "satire."  "-ization" is a suffix forming nouns denoting the act or process of doing something.
