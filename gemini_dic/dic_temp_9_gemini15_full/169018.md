The word "progambling" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism or a misspelling.  It might be a combination of "pro-" (meaning "in favor of" or "supporting") and "gambling."  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible without further context.  If you had intended a different word or have more context, please provide it.
