词源:

The word "downspout" is a compound word.  "Down" indicates the direction of water flow, and "spout" refers to a pipe or tube that discharges liquid.  The etymology of "spout" traces back to Old French *espout, from Latin *exsputare, meaning "to spit out".  Therefore,  "downspout" literally means a pipe that spits out water downwards.
