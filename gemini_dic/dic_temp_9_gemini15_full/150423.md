pansophical:/ˌpæn.səˈfɪk.əl/| adj.|博学的；通晓一切的；无所不知的 |  Having or showing great knowledge or learning; omniscient.  The term implies a breadth of knowledge encompassing various fields, often suggesting an almost encyclopedic understanding.  However, it can also carry a slightly negative connotation, suggesting pretentiousness or impracticality due to the unattainability of true omniscience. |例句：His pansophical pronouncements on every subject, from astrophysics to ancient history, often left his listeners bewildered.  他的关于从天体物理学到古代历史等各个学科的博学论断，常常让听众感到困惑。


The pansophical approach to education attempted to cover every conceivable subject, but it proved ultimately unworkable.  这种博学的教育方法试图涵盖所有可以想象的学科，但最终证明是行不通的。|近义词：omniscient, erudite, encyclopedic, polymathic |反义词：ignorant, uneducated, uninformed, simple-minded
