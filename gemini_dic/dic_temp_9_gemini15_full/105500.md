kilobits:/ˈkɪləbɪts/| n. |千比特，千位元|A kilobit (kb) is a unit of digital information equal to 1,000 bits.  It's often used to measure data transfer rates or the size of digital files, although in some contexts, particularly in computing, it can also refer to 1024 bits (2^10 bits).|The download speed was 100 kilobits per second.|megabits, megabytes|bytes, bits|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The internet connection transmits data at 50 kilobits per second. = 互联网连接以每秒50千比特的速度传输数据。
This file size is approximately 2 kilobits. = 此文件大小约为2千比特。


一般过去时:
The old modem transferred data at only 56 kilobits per second. = 旧调制解调器的数据传输速度仅为每秒56千比特。
Yesterday's download speed peaked at 200 kilobits per second. = 昨天的下载速度峰值达到了每秒200千比特。


现在完成时:
We have transferred over 1000 kilobits of data this morning. = 我们今天上午已经传输了超过1000千比特的数据。
The server has received several megabytes, which includes many kilobits of information. = 服务器已收到几兆字节的数据，其中包括许多千比特的信息。


过去完成时:
Before the upgrade, the system had only supported speeds up to 10 kilobits per second. = 升级之前，系统仅支持高达每秒10千比特的速度。
They had already downloaded several kilobits of the large file before the connection dropped. = 在连接中断之前，他们已经下载了大型文件中的几千比特。


将来时:
We will achieve higher transfer speeds, likely exceeding 1000 kilobits per second. = 我们将实现更高的传输速度，可能超过每秒1000千比特。
The new network will support data transfer rates of up to 10,000 kilobits per second. = 新网络将支持高达每秒10,000千比特的数据传输速率。


虚拟语气:
If the connection were faster (more than 100 kilobits per second), the download would be complete by now. = 如果连接更快（超过每秒100千比特），下载现在就完成了。
I wish the data transfer rate were higher than 5 kilobits per second. = 我希望数据传输速率高于每秒5千比特。


被动语态:
The data was transmitted at a rate of 50 kilobits per second. = 数据以每秒50千比特的速度传输。
The file size is calculated in kilobits. = 文件大小以千比特计算。


疑问句:
What is the data transfer rate in kilobits per second? = 每秒的数据传输速率是多少千比特？
How many kilobits are in this file? = 这个文件有多少千比特？


否定句:
The download speed was not as fast as expected; it was below 10 kilobits per second. = 下载速度不如预期快；低于每秒10千比特。
The system did not support data transfer rates exceeding 100 kilobits per second. = 系统不支持超过每秒100千比特的数据传输速率。


PHRASE->
kilobits per second (kbps) = 千比特每秒
kilobits of data = 千比特数据
kilobit rate = 千比特速率
data in kilobits = 以千比特为单位的数据
transfer kilobits = 传输千比特
