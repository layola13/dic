semiconformities:/ˌsemiˈkɒnfɔːmɪtiz/| n.|不整合面,半整合|An unconformity in which the bedding planes of the younger rocks are parallel to those of the older rocks, but there is a significant time gap between their deposition.  This implies an erosional surface or period of non-deposition exists between the layers.  Unlike a disconformity, there's no angular discordance in the bedding planes.|例句：The geological survey revealed several semicontinuities and unconformities in the rock strata. 地质勘测揭示了岩层中存在几个半整合面和不整合面。

例句：The presence of semicontinuities indicates periods of erosion or non-deposition interrupting the continuous sedimentation. 半整合面的存在表明沉积过程中间断存在侵蚀或不沉积时期。
