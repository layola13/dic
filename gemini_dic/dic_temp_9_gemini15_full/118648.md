The word "mest" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  Perhaps a misspelling of "most," "messed," or another word entirely?
* **It's a slang term or regionalism:** It might be used informally in a specific community or region, but lacks wider recognition.
* **It's a neologism:** It could be a newly coined word not yet widely adopted.
* **It's from another language:**  The word might originate from another language and be used in a specific context.


To help me provide the analysis you're looking for, please clarify:

1. **Where did you encounter this word?** (e.g., a book, conversation, website)
2. **What was the context of its use?**  Providing the sentence or phrase it appeared in would be very helpful.

With more information, I can offer a more accurate response.
