mercator-projections:/mərˈkeɪtər prəˈdʒɛkʃənz/| n. |墨卡托投影|Mercator projections are a type of map projection that shows the Earth's surface on a flat plane.  It preserves the shapes of landmasses but distorts their relative sizes, especially at higher latitudes.  The farther from the equator, the greater the distortion.  This projection is particularly useful for navigation because it shows lines of constant compass bearing as straight lines. |Example:  The Mercator projection is commonly used in nautical charts. 墨卡托投影常用于航海图。The distortion in the Mercator projection makes Greenland appear much larger than it actually is. 墨卡托投影的变形使得格陵兰看起来比实际大得多。|近义词：map projection, conformal projection |反义词：None (it's a specific type of projection)|名词
