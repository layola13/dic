词源:
The word "potion" comes from the Old French word "pocion," which in turn derives from the Vulgar Latin word "potionem," the accusative singular form of "potiō," meaning "a drink."  The ultimate origin is likely the Proto-Italic word *potiōn-, related to the Latin verb "pōtāre," meaning "to drink."  Thus, the word's core meaning has always been linked to a drink, though the modern connotation often includes magical or medicinal properties.
