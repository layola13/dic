词源:
The word's etymology is uncertain, but it's likely a combination of "rig" (meaning "to arrange" or "to manipulate") and "marole" (of uncertain origin, possibly related to Middle English "marol," meaning "a foolish person").  The earliest recorded use dates back to the 17th century.  Its meaning evolved over time from referring to a playful or nonsensical rhyme or song to its current meaning of a tedious and complicated procedure.
