The term "choose-up" is not a standard English word found in dictionaries.  It's likely a phrasal verb or informal term used in specific contexts, possibly regional dialects or within particular games or activities.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and formal grammatical breakdown aren't possible.

To provide a useful response, we need more context on where you encountered this term.  For example:

* **What was the sentence or situation where you saw "choose-up"?** This would help determine its meaning and potential grammatical function.
* **What is the context or activity?**  Is it related to sports, children's games, or something else?


Once this information is provided, I can give you a more accurate analysis, including a possible meaning, and attempt to explain its usage.  Without this context, any explanation would be pure speculation.
