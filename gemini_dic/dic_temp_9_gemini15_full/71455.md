flamelet:/ˈfleɪmlət/ | n. |小火焰；火焰单元 | A small, self-sustaining flame, often used in the context of combustion modeling.  It is a simplified model of a turbulent flame, treating it as a collection of many small, independent flames.  | Example:  The simulation used a flamelet model to predict the behavior of the turbulent diffusion flame.  = 模拟使用了火焰单元模型来预测湍流扩散火焰的行为。|近义词：small flame, flame element | 反义词：large fire, conflagration
