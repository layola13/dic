词源:

The word "motivated" is derived from the verb "motivate," which comes from the Latin word "motus," meaning "moved."  The suffix "-ated" indicates the past participle form, showing the state of being acted upon.  Therefore, "motivated" signifies the state of being "moved" or driven to action by a particular reason or impulse.
