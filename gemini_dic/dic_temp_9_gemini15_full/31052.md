词源:
The word "chameleon" comes from the Late Latin word *chamaeleon*, which in turn comes from the Greek word χαμαιλέων (khamailéōn).  This Greek word is a compound of χαμαί (khamaí), meaning "on the ground," and λέων (léōn), meaning "lion."  The name reflects the lizard's terrestrial habit and possibly its perceived lion-like appearance.
