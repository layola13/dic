词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation.

* **sanguine**: From Latin *sanguis*, meaning "blood." In classical humoral theory, a sanguine temperament was associated with an abundance of blood, leading to an optimistic and cheerful disposition.


用法说明:

This word is not frequently used in everyday conversation. It's more common in literary or formal writing where a nuanced expression of cautious optimism is desired.  The "quasi-" prefix tempers the strong positivity of "sanguine," suggesting a degree of reservation or uncertainty.
