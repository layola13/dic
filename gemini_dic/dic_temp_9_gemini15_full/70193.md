fibrinoplastin:/ˌfaɪbrɪˈnɒplæstɪn/ | n. |纤维蛋白原 | A now-obsolete term for fibrinogen.  It was once believed to be a separate substance involved in fibrin formation, but it is now understood to be synonymous with fibrinogen.  | Example: The older literature sometimes refers to fibrinoplastin, but this term is outdated.  = 较旧的文献有时会提到纤维蛋白原，但这个术语已经过时了。 |近义词：fibrinogen |反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Fibrinogen plays a crucial role in blood clotting. = 纤维蛋白原在血液凝固中起着至关重要的作用。
The doctor checks the fibrinogen levels regularly. = 医生定期检查纤维蛋白原水平。

一般过去时:
Scientists once believed fibrinoplastin was a distinct substance. = 科学家曾经认为纤维蛋白原是一种独特的物质。
The research showed a deficiency in fibrinoplastin. = 研究表明纤维蛋白原缺乏。


现在完成时:
Researchers have confirmed that fibrinoplastin and fibrinogen are the same. = 研究人员已经证实纤维蛋白原和纤维蛋白原是相同的。
The study has revealed the importance of fibrinogen in wound healing. = 研究揭示了纤维蛋白原在伤口愈合中的重要性。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, scientists had thought fibrinoplastin was different from fibrinogen. = 在这一发现之前，科学家们认为纤维蛋白原与纤维蛋白原不同。
They had already completed the analysis of the fibrinoplastin sample. = 他们已经完成了纤维蛋白原样本的分析。


将来时:
Further studies will clarify the exact role of fibrinogen in various diseases. = 进一步的研究将阐明纤维蛋白原在各种疾病中的确切作用。
We will continue to monitor the patient's fibrinogen levels. = 我们将继续监测患者的纤维蛋白原水平。


虚拟语气:
If fibrinogen levels were lower, the bleeding would be more severe. = 如果纤维蛋白原水平较低，出血会更严重。
It is vital that the fibrinogen levels are maintained within the normal range. = 维持纤维蛋白原水平在正常范围内至关重要。


被动语态:
Fibrinogen is converted into fibrin during blood clotting. = 纤维蛋白原在血液凝固过程中转化为纤维蛋白。
The fibrinogen levels were carefully monitored by the medical team. = 纤维蛋白原水平由医疗团队仔细监测。


疑问句:
What is the normal range of fibrinogen levels? = 纤维蛋白原的正常范围是多少？
Are low fibrinogen levels a cause for concern? = 纤维蛋白原水平低是否需要关注？


否定句:
Fibrinoplastin is not a separate substance. = 纤维蛋白原不是一种单独的物质。
The patient did not show any deficiency in fibrinogen. = 病人没有显示任何纤维蛋白原缺乏。


PHRASE->
fibrinogen levels = 纤维蛋白原水平
low fibrinogen = 纤维蛋白原低
fibrinogen deficiency = 纤维蛋白原缺乏
high fibrinogen = 纤维蛋白原高
fibrinogen concentration = 纤维蛋白原浓度
