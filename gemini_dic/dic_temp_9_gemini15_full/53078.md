dioxygen:/ˈdaɪɒksɪdʒən/ | n. | 双氧，氧气 | Dioxygen refers to the diatomic form of the element oxygen, O2, which is the most common form of oxygen found in the Earth's atmosphere and essential for respiration in most living organisms.  It's a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas. | Example:  Plants produce dioxygen during photosynthesis.  植物在光合作用过程中产生双氧。  The air we breathe contains about 21% dioxygen. 我们呼吸的空气中约含有21%的双氧。|近义词：oxygen|反义词：None (It's an element, not a concept with a direct opposite)|名词
