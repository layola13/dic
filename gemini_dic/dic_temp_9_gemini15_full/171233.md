词源:
The word "psychotrophic" is a combination of "psycho-" (from Greek *psykhē*, meaning "mind, soul, spirit") and "-trophic" (from Greek *trophē*, meaning "nourishment").  Therefore, it literally means "mind-nourishing" or "mind-affecting," though the latter is a more accurate modern interpretation given its usage.
