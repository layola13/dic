词源:

The word "chevroned" is derived from "chevron," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "chevron," meaning "rafter" or "a piece of timber."  This refers to the V-shape of a rafter, which is the same shape as the chevron pattern.  The "-ed" suffix indicates that something is adorned or characterized by chevrons.
