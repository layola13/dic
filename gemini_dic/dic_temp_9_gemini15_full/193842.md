self-differentiating: /ˌsɛlf ˈdɪfəˌrenʃieɪtɪŋ/ | adj. | 自我分化的；自组织的 |

英文解析:  Describing a system or process that can spontaneously organize itself into distinct parts or structures without external direction or control.

It can also be applied to other fields, such as computer science and social systems, to describe processes of self-organization.
