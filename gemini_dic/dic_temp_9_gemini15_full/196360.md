词源:
Seriously derives from the adjective "serious," which comes from the Old French "serieux," meaning "grave, solemn."  This ultimately traces back to the Latin "serius," the comparative form of "serus," meaning "late, serious, grave."  The "-ly" suffix is an adverbial ending, indicating manner or degree.
