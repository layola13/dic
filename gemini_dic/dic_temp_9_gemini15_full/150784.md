词源:

The word "paradisial" derives from the word "paradise," which ultimately traces back to the Old French "paradis" and further to the Late Latin "paradisus."  This in turn is derived from the Greek "παράδεισος" (paradeisos), meaning "park" or "enclosed garden." The word's evolution reflects its association with the Garden of Eden, a concept of earthly paradise.
