cantilevering: /ˈkæntɪliːvərɪŋ/ | v. |悬臂支撑；悬臂式结构 |The act of extending a structure, such as a beam or bridge, so that it projects horizontally beyond its support.  This is achieved without intermediate supports, relying instead on the cantilever principle.  |例句：The bridge's design relies heavily on cantilevering to span the wide river.  桥梁的设计很大程度上依赖于悬臂式结构来跨越宽阔的河流。


The architect used cantilevering to create a dramatic overhang. 建筑师利用悬臂式结构创造了一个引人注目的悬挑。


近义词： projecting, overhanging, overreaching |反义词：supported (fully), braced (fully)

词源:
The word "cantilevering" comes from the French word "cantilever," which in turn is derived from the Italian word "cantilevere." The ultimate origin is uncertain but likely involves a combination of "canto" (corner, edge) and "lever" (to lift or raise).  The word reflects the structural action of a projecting beam or element "leveraging" or extending from a single support point.
