词源:  From slender + -ly.  "Slender" itself comes from Old English *slēnd(r)e,  meaning "long and thin," perhaps ultimately from a Proto-Germanic root related to "slide" or "glide," suggesting a smoothly tapering shape.


用法说明:

slenderly主要用作副词，修饰动词，描述动作的纤细、优雅或苗条的方式。它强调的是一种精细、优雅的动作或姿态，而不是简单的“瘦”或“细”。
