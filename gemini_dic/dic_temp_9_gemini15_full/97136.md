词源:  The word "infiltrations" comes from the verb "infiltrate," which is formed from the prefix "in-" (into) and the verb "filtrate," meaning "to pass through a filter" or "to permeate."  The original sense referred to the passage of a liquid through a porous substance, but the meaning evolved to include the covert entry of people or ideas into an organization or territory.
