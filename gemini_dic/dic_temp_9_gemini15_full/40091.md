词源:
The word "containment" derives from the verb "contain," which comes from the Old French word "contenir," meaning "to hold within," "to keep within bounds," or "to comprise."  The prefix "con-" indicates "together" or "completely," while "-tain" is related to the Latin word "tenēre," meaning "to hold."  Therefore, "containment" literally means "the act of holding something completely within."
