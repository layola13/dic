propionyl:/proʊˈpaɪənɪl/ | adj. |丙酰基|A propionyl group is an acyl group derived from propionic acid.  It has the formula CH3CH2CO−. It's an organic functional group consisting of a propyl group (CH3CH2CH2−) with one hydrogen atom removed from the terminal carbon atom and replaced with a carbonyl group (=O).| Propionyl chloride is used in the synthesis of propionates.  The propionyl group is found in many natural products and synthetic compounds.|近义词:acyl (broader term)|反义词:N/A


英文解析:The propionyl group is a three-carbon acyl group derived from propionic acid (also known as propanoic acid).  It's characterized by a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to an ethyl group (CH2CH3).  This functional group is frequently encountered in organic chemistry, appearing in various molecules as a substituent.  It plays a role in the synthesis of many compounds and is a component of some naturally occurring substances.


例句:

The synthesis involved the addition of a propionyl group to the benzene ring. = 合成过程包括向苯环添加丙酰基。

Propionyl-CoA is an important intermediate in metabolic pathways.  = 丙酰辅酶A是代谢途径中的重要中间体。


词性:形容词 (It describes a type of group)
