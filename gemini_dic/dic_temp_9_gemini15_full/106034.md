词源:
The word "kneecap" is a compound word formed from "knee" and "cap".  "Knee" is from Old English *cnēo, and "cap" is from Old French *cape.  The meaning reflects the bone's protective function over the knee joint, like a cap covering something.  The term "patella" is the more formal anatomical term, derived from Latin, meaning "small shallow dish."
