词源:
The word "elasticity" originates from the Latin word "elasticus," meaning "capable of springing back," which in turn derives from the Greek word "ἐλαστικός" (elastikos), also meaning "capable of being driven," "driven," or "propelled."  The suffix "-ity" is an English nominalizing suffix that creates nouns from adjectives.
