词源:  The word "maraschino" comes from the Italian word "marasca," which refers to a type of wild cherry native to the Dalmatian Coast.  The cherries were originally preserved in a brandy-based liqueur.  The process of making maraschino cherries has evolved, and today's commercially available versions often utilize other methods and flavorings.
