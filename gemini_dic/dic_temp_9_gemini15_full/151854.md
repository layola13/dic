词源:
The word "passionate" derives from the Late Latin word "passionatus," meaning "suffering," which in turn comes from the Latin word "pati," meaning "to suffer" or "to endure."  In earlier English usage, "passion" often referred to intense suffering, particularly religious suffering.  Over time, the meaning evolved to include intense emotion, whether positive or negative, leading to the modern meaning of "passionate" as filled with strong emotion, especially enthusiasm.
