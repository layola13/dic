/ˌfoʊnoʊtækˈtɪksɪz/ | n. | 语音搭配学 | The study of the permitted combinations of sounds in a particular language.  Phonotactics examines the rules governing the sequence of sounds in syllables and words.  It deals with the constraints on the possible sound combinations within a language, explaining why some sequences are permissible and others are not. For example, English allows "st" at the beginning of a word (e.g., "street"), but not "ts" (although "ts" can appear within a word, like "eastern"). |  The phonotactics of English differ significantly from those of Japanese.  | 近义词: sound patterning, syllable structure,  | 反义词:  (no direct antonym, as it's a field of study) |  n.


USAGE->
This word, being a relatively specialized term in linguistics, doesn't have common usage in everyday conversational English. Its use would primarily be confined to academic or professional contexts related to linguistics, phonetics, or speech pathology. Therefore, demonstrating tenses, moods, or voices in example sentences is less relevant than illustrating its usage in different contexts.


Example 1 (Academic writing):
"This paper investigates the phonotactics of Modern Standard Arabic, focusing on the constraints on consonant clusters." = 这篇论文探讨了现代标准阿拉伯语的语音搭配学，重点是辅音组合的限制。


Example 2 (Linguistics lecture):
"Understanding a language's phonotactics is crucial for building accurate speech synthesizers." = 理解一种语言的语音搭配对于构建精确的语音合成器至关重要。


Example 3 (Research proposal):
"The proposed research will analyze the phonotactic patterns in child language acquisition." =  拟议的研究将分析儿童语言习得中的语音搭配模式。


Example 4 (Discussion among linguists):
"The unusual phonotactics of this language suggest a unique historical development." =  这种语言不同寻常的语音搭配表明了一种独特的历史发展。
