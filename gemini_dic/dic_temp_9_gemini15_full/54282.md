词源:  From the verb "disguise," which comes from the Old French *desguiser, composed of the prefix *des- (meaning "to do away with," "remove," or "undo") and *guiser (meaning "to guide," "lead," or "direct").  The suffix "-ments" is a noun suffix indicating the result of an action or a collection of things.  Therefore, "disguisements" literally means the results of actions taken to remove or undo something's true nature.
