词源:
The word "denial" comes from the Old French word "deniement," meaning "refusal" or "denial."  This, in turn, derives from the verb "de nier," meaning "to deny," which has roots in Latin "denegare," a compound of "de-" (away, from) and "negare" (to say no).  Thus, the core meaning traces back to the act of saying "no" to something.
