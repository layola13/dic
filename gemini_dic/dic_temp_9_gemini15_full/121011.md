词源:
mis- (错误的，坏的) + coinage (铸币；创造新词)

The word combines the prefix "mis-" indicating error or wrongness, with "coinage," referring to the creation or minting of coins or the invention of new words or phrases.  Therefore, "miscoinage" signifies an error in minting coins or an incorrect use of a word or phrase.
