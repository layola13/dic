词源:

The word "extortionate" derives from the verb "extort," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "extorquere," meaning "to twist out" or "to wrest from."  This reflects the forceful and unfair nature of obtaining something through extortion.  The suffix "-ate" transforms the verb into an adjective, describing something characterized by extortion.
