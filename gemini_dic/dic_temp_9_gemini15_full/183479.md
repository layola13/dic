词源:
The word "repugnance" comes from the Latin word "repugnantia,"  meaning "resistance," "opposition," or "contrariety."  It entered English in the 16th century.  The Latin root is "pugnare," meaning "to fight."  Therefore, the core meaning relates to something that is resisted or fought against due to its offensiveness or unpleasantness.
