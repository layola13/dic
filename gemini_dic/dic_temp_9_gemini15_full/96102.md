词源:
The word "indefinite" comes from the Old French word *indefinit*, which is a combination of the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "definite".  "Definite" itself has Latin roots, deriving from the Latin word *definitus*, the past participle of *definire*, meaning "to define" or "to limit".


用法说明:


As an adjective, "indefinite" describes something that lacks clear boundaries, limits, or definition. It can apply to various aspects, including time, quantity, and meaning.

1. **Time:**  Refers to a period of time that is not specified or has no fixed end.

例句：He’ll be away for an indefinite period. 他将离开一段时间，时间未定。
例句：The strike lasted for an indefinite period. 罢工持续了不确定的一段时间。


2. **Quantity:** Refers to an unspecified or unlimited amount or number.

例句：An indefinite number of people attended the concert. 不确定数量的人参加了音乐会。
例句：There are indefinite possibilities. 有无限的可能性。


3. **Grammar:** In grammar, "indefinite" is used to describe pronouns (like "someone," "anyone," "something") and articles ("a," "an") that don't refer to a specific person, thing, or amount.

例句：Someone is at the door. 有人在门口。
例句：I need a pen. 我需要一支笔。


4. **Meaning:** Refers to something unclear, vague, or ambiguous.

例句：His explanation was indefinite and confusing. 他的解释含糊不清且令人困惑。
例句：The terms of the contract were indefinite. 合同条款含糊不清。


5. **Articles:** "A" and "an" are indefinite articles because they don't specify which item is being referred to.


例句：I saw a bird. 我看到一只鸟。(Not a specific bird)
例句：She bought an apple. 她买了一个苹果。(Not a specific apple)


6. **Pronouns:** Indefinite pronouns like "somebody," "anyone," "nothing" refer to unspecified individuals or things.

例句：Somebody left their phone here. 有人把手机落在这里了。
例句：Is there anything I can help you with? 我能帮您什么忙吗？


The opposite of indefinite is definite, meaning clearly defined or specified.
