词源:
The word "condom" ultimately derives from "cundum," a word appearing in the late 18th century.  The origin is uncertain, but it's believed to be linked to the name of a physician, possibly Dr. Condom or a similar variation, who is credited with popularizing a form of the device.  Earlier forms of contraceptive sheaths existed, but the association with the name "condom" solidified its use.  Therefore, the etymology is somewhat obscure and lacks definitive proof of a single origin.
