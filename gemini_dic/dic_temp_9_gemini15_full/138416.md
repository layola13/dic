noumenon:/ˈnuːmɪnɒn/ | n. |本体，物自体 |A noumenon is a thing-in-itself, an object of thought or understanding that exists independently of our experience or perception.  It is a concept central to Kantian philosophy, representing the thing as it is in itself, as opposed to the phenomenon, which is the thing as it appears to us.  The noumenon is unknowable in its true nature because our understanding is limited by our sensory experience. | Example: Kant argued that while we can experience phenomena, the noumenon remains forever beyond our grasp.  康德认为，虽然我们可以体验现象，但本体却永远超出了我们的理解范围。| 近义词：thing-in-itself, essence, reality | 反义词：phenomenon, appearance
