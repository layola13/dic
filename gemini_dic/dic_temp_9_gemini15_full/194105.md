self-impedances: /ˈsɛlf ɪmˈpiːdənsɪz/ | n. | 自阻抗 | The internal resistance or opposition to the flow of current within a component or system.  Self-impedances are crucial in electrical engineering for understanding and predicting circuit behavior. They represent the inherent limitations on current flow within a device itself, independent of external factors. | Example:  The self-impedances of the transistors significantly affected the amplifier's gain. 自阻抗晶体管显著影响了放大器的增益。 |近义词：internal resistance, intrinsic impedance | 反义词：external impedance, load impedance | 名词
