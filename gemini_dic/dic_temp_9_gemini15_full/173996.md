词源:
* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "almost," or "like."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation, but not a complete equivalence.
* **sympathetically**: From "sympathetic," combining "sym-" (together) and "pathos" (suffering, feeling).  "-ally" is an adverbial suffix.  Thus, it means "in a sympathetic manner."


The word combines the sense of "almost" or "seemingly" from "quasi-" with the manner of expressing sympathy.  It describes an action or response that appears to be sympathetic but lacks genuine empathy or feeling.
