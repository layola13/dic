The word "prefixions" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need a correct word or clarification of the intended meaning.  If you meant a similar-sounding word or had a different word in mind, please provide the correct spelling.
