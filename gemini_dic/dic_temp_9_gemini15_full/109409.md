The word "leod" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested in the format.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name or place name not widely known.
* **It's from a dialect or archaic English:**  It could be a word used in a specific region or historical period.
* **It's a neologism or invented word:**  It might be a newly coined word not yet in common usage.


If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
