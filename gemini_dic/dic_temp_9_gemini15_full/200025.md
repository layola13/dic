skeletogenous:/ˌskelɪˈtɒdʒənəs/ | adj. |成骨的；骨发生的| Relating to or concerned with the formation of bone.  The term describes the process and structures involved in bone development.  It often refers to tissues or cells that contribute to bone formation, such as osteoblasts. | Example:  Skeletogenous cells are crucial for the growth and repair of bones. 成骨细胞对于骨骼的生长和修复至关重要。  The skeletogenous layer of the developing embryo contributes to the formation of the skeleton.  发育中的胚胎的成骨层有助于骨骼的形成。| 近义词：osteogenic, bone-forming | 反义词：bone-resorbing, osteoclastic
