reedbird: /ˈriːdbɜːrd/ | n. | 葦鶯；秧雞 | A migratory bird, especially a rail, that feeds in marshes and reeds.  The term is often used ambiguously and can refer to various species. | Example:  The reedbirds were singing beautifully in the marsh.  葦鶯在沼澤裡優美地歌唱。


The term "reedbird" is not precise and refers to several species of birds that frequent reed beds and marshes.  Historically, the term was often applied to the ricebird ( *Ammodramus savannarum*), which was hunted extensively in the past.  However, more broadly, it can encompass various rails and other birds that share similar habitats and feeding behaviors.  The ambiguity necessitates carefully considering the context to understand which species is being referred to.
