The word "in-raw" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a newly coined term, or a term specific to a particular field or dialect.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, more context is needed.  Where did you encounter this word?  What was the surrounding text?

If you can provide this context, I can try to offer a possible interpretation and analysis.
