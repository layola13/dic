The word "saudian" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are not possible.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (perhaps a name or place), or a neologism (newly coined word) not yet widely accepted.

To provide a helpful response, I need more context. Where did you encounter this word? Knowing its source might help determine its meaning and intended usage.
