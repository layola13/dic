词源:
The noun "drone" ultimately derives from the Old English word *drōn, meaning "a male bee," referring to the buzzing sound they make.  The verb sense, meaning "to make a buzzing sound," follows naturally. The modern sense of "unmanned aerial vehicle" is a relatively recent extension of the word's meaning.
