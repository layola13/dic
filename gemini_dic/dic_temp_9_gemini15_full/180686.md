词源:
The word "regression" comes from the Latin word "regressio," meaning "a going back."  It was coined in the field of statistics by Sir Francis Galton in the late 19th century, referring to the tendency of offspring to revert to the mean of the population.  The psychological meaning of regression, referring to a return to earlier behavior, followed later.
