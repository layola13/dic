schizocarp:/ˈskɪzəˌkɑːrp/| n. |分果|A schizocarp is a dry fruit that splits at maturity into several one-seeded portions called mericarps.

Instead, they separate from each other. |例句：The plant produced a schizocarp, which then broke into four individual mericarps.  这植物结了一个分果，然后裂成四个单独的小果。|近义词：cremocarp, regma |反义词：berry, drupe
