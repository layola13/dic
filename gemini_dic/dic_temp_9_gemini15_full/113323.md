词源:

The word "luxe" is derived from the French word "luxe," which itself comes from the Latin word "luxus," meaning "luxury," "extravagance," or "excess."  The French word entered English in the 19th century, initially as a more literary and sophisticated term to describe luxury, and has gained more common usage in recent decades.
