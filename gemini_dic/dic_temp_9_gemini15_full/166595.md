The word "presecure" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a particular field or context not widely recognized.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis as requested.  To help, I need more context where you encountered this word.  Was it in a technical document, a piece of fiction, or somewhere else? Knowing the source would allow for a more accurate interpretation and potentially reveal its intended meaning.
