WORD ORIGIN->

The word "offensivenesses" is derived from the adjective "offensive," which comes from the Old French word "offensif," ultimately stemming from the Latin verb "offendere," meaning "to strike against, attack, offend."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality. The addition of "-es" creates the plural form, signifying multiple instances of offensiveness.
