preenjoyable:/ˌpriːɪnˈdʒɔɪəbl/| adj.| 预先令人愉快的，提前享受的 |  This word is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, a newly coined word, formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before or in advance) and "enjoyable" (meaning giving pleasure or satisfaction).  It suggests the anticipation or expectation of enjoyment before an event actually occurs.  There's no established dictionary definition or common usage.  The meaning relies entirely on context. | 例句：The preenjoyable anticipation of the vacation was almost as good as the vacation itself.  提前享受假期的期待几乎和假期本身一样美好。|近义词：anticipated, expected, promising |反义词：unpleasant, disappointing |形容词
