lapling:/ˈlæplɪŋ/| n. |拍打声；轻拍声|The sound of gentle splashing or patting.  It is not a widely used or established word, and its meaning is largely inferential based on the combination of "lap" (to strike gently) and "-ing" (present participle).  Therefore, precise definitions and usage examples are limited.|例句：The lapling of the waves against the hull was a soothing sound.  海浪轻轻拍打船体的声音很舒缓。|近义词：lapping, splashing, pattering|反义词：loud crashing, booming


USAGE->
This word lacks established grammatical usage examples due to its infrequent use.  The "-ing" suffix suggests it could function nominally or adjectivally in very informal contexts, potentially describing a sound or an action.  For example:  "The continuous lapling annoyed me."  (Adjectival use, describing a continuous sound).


PHRASE->
There are no established phrases using "lapling".  The word's limited usage prevents the formation of common collocations.
