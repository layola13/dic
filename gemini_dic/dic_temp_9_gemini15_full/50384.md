词源:  The word "deportment" comes from the Old French word "deport," meaning "behavior" or "conduct," which itself is derived from the Latin word "deportare," meaning "to carry away" or "to transport."  The suffix "-ment" adds the sense of a noun of action or state.  The original sense was more about carrying oneself, implying physical posture and carriage, which then evolved to encompass the broader sense of behavior and etiquette.
