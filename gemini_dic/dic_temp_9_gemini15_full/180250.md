refracturing: /ˌriːˈfræktʃərɪŋ/ | n. | 再压裂；二次压裂 | The process of creating new fractures in a previously fractured reservoir rock formation to stimulate oil and gas production.  It involves injecting high-pressure fluids into the well to create additional pathways for hydrocarbons to flow to the wellbore.  | Example: Refracturing is a common technique used to enhance production from mature oil and gas wells.  二次压裂是提高成熟油气井产量的常用技术。 | 近义词: secondary fracturing, stimulation | 反义词:  (no direct antonym, but the opposite would be ceasing production or abandoning a well) | 名词
