neuropore:/ˈnʊəroʊpɔːr/| n. |神经孔|An opening in the neural tube of a developing embryo, which eventually closes to form the brain and spinal cord.  Neuropores are crucial for the proper development of the central nervous system. Failure of neuropore closure can lead to serious birth defects like anencephaly and spina bifida.|The neural tube failed to close completely, resulting in an open neuropore and subsequent neural tube defect.|近义词:neural tube opening|反义词:closed neural tube
