neoimpressionism:/ˌniːoʊɪmˈprɛʃənɪzəm/| n. |新印象派|Neo-impressionism is a late 19th-century art movement that emphasized the scientific application of color theory and the optical mixture of colors to achieve a vibrant and luminous effect.  It rejected the subjective brushstrokes of Impressionism in favor of a more methodical and structured approach.  Artists applied small, distinct dots of pure color, believing that the viewer's eye would optically blend these dots from a distance, creating a more intense and harmonious effect.  |The paintings of Georges Seurat are prime examples of neo-impressionism. |Post-Impressionism, pointillism|Abstract Expressionism|名词
