/ˈmæɡməˌtɪst/| n. |岩浆学家|A geologist specializing in the study of magma and its related phenomena, including igneous rocks and volcanic activity.  Magmatists investigate the origin, composition, evolution, and emplacement of magmas. Their work contributes to understanding plate tectonics, volcanology, and the formation of various rock types.|Example: The magmatist presented her findings on the chemical composition of the recently erupted lava.|近义词：petrologist (if focusing on igneous petrology), volcanologist (if focusing on volcanic aspects)|反义词：无
