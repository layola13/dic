词源:

The word "hackly" is derived from "hack," meaning to cut or chop roughly. The suffix "-ly" transforms the verb into an adjective, describing something with a quality of having been roughly cut or chopped, resulting in a rough or uneven surface.  The word likely evolved from the Old English word "haccian" meaning to "hack" or "hew".


用法说明:


hackly主要用作形容词，描述表面粗糙、不平整、参差不齐的物体。它通常指自然形成的表面，例如岩石、树皮、木头等。很少用于描述人工制造的物体，除非是故意制造出粗糙不平的效果。
