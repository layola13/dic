longicornia: /ˌlɒŋɪˈkɔːniə/ | n. |长角甲虫类；（昆虫纲）长角亚目 |  Longicornia is a taxonomic suborder of beetles (Coleoptera) characterized by their exceptionally long antennae, often exceeding their body length.  They are diverse in size, shape, and color.  Many species are brightly colored and exhibit striking patterns. The suborder is now largely obsolete, with its members often classified within the superfamily Cerambycoidea. | Example:  The vibrant longicornia species of the Amazon rainforest are a testament to the incredible biodiversity of the region.  亚马逊雨林中色彩鲜艳的长角甲虫种类证明了该地区令人难以置信的生物多样性。 | 近义词: cerambycids (more precise term for the beetles formerly in Longicornia) | 反义词: N/A (no direct antonym)
