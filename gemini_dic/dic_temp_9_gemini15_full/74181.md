词源:
The term "four-wheel drive" is a straightforward compound of "four," "wheel," and "drive."  "Four" and "wheel" are self-explanatory. "Drive" in this context refers to the transmission of power from the engine to the wheels, enabling the vehicle's movement. The term emerged with the development of vehicles designed for off-road use, where all four wheels needed power for optimal traction.
