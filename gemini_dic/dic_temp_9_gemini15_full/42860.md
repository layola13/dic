词源:
The word "courtesan" comes from the Old French word "cortesane," which itself derives from the Italian "cortesana."  The root is "corte," meaning "court,"  reflecting the historical association of courtesans with royal courts and the aristocracy.  They were often educated and sophisticated women who occupied a complex social position, neither fully respectable nor entirely marginalized.
