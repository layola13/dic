The word "footier" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a particular dialect or context.  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a useful response, clarification is needed on the intended word or its source.
