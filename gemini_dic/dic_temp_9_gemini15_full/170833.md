PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "pseudofeverish".  The word itself is relatively uncommon and used primarily in a medical context.  However, phrases describing similar sensations could include:

feeling under the weather:  感觉不舒服
run-down:  精疲力尽的
feeling unwell:  感觉不舒服
out of sorts:  不舒服
a touch feverish: 有点发烧


词源:

The word is a combination of:

* **pseudo-**:  (from Greek ψευδής, *pseudēs*, "false," "lying")  meaning false or seemingly.
* **feverish**:  relating to or characterized by fever.


Therefore, "pseudofeverish" literally means "falsely feverish" or "seeming feverish."
