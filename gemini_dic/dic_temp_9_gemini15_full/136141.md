nonrefractive: /ˌnɒn.rɪˈfræk.tɪv/ | adj. | 非折射的 | Not causing or involving refraction of light.  This term describes materials or surfaces that do not bend light as it passes through or reflects off them.  | Example:  The nonrefractive coating on the lens minimizes image distortion.  非折射涂层可以最大限度地减少图像失真。 | 近义词：transparent (in the context of not bending light), unrefracting | 反义词：refractive


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The nonrefractive material does not bend light. = 非折射材料不会弯曲光线。
This lens is nonrefractive. = 这个镜片是非折射的。

一般过去时:
The experiment showed that the material was nonrefractive. = 实验表明该材料是非折射的。
The scientist confirmed the substance was nonrefractive. = 科学家证实该物质是非折射的。

现在完成时:
Researchers have developed a new nonrefractive material. = 研究人员已经开发出一种新型非折射材料。
They have confirmed that the coating is nonrefractive. = 他们已经证实该涂层是非折射的。

过去完成时:
Scientists had already discovered that the substance was nonrefractive. = 科学家们早已发现该物质是非折射的。
Before the test, we had assumed the material was nonrefractive. = 在测试之前，我们假设该材料是非折射的。

将来时:
Future applications will utilize nonrefractive materials. = 未来应用将利用非折射材料。
We will test if the new lens is nonrefractive. = 我们将测试新镜片是否是非折射的。

虚拟语气:
If this material were nonrefractive, it would be ideal for this application. = 如果这种材料是非折射的，它将非常适合这种应用。
I wish the coating were truly nonrefractive. = 我希望涂层确实是完全非折射的。

被动语态:
The light was not refracted by the nonrefractive surface. = 光线没有被非折射表面折射。
The nonrefractive properties of the material were confirmed. = 该材料的非折射特性得到了证实。

疑问句:
Is this material nonrefractive? = 这种材料是非折射的吗？
Are all transparent materials also nonrefractive? = 所有透明材料都是非折射的吗？

否定句:
The material is not completely nonrefractive. = 该材料并非完全非折射。
The lens is not designed to be nonrefractive. = 该透镜并非设计为非折射的。
