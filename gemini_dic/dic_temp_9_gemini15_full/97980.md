词源:
From "inoculate" + "-able".  "Inoculate" comes from Latin *inoculare, from in- "in" + oculum "eye," referring to the early practice of grafting by inserting a bud into an eye or slit in the bark.  The meaning extended to the insertion of material into a living organism, hence the medical use related to vaccination.
