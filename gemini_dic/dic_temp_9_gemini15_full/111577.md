lobotomies:/ləˈbɒtəmiːz/ | n. | 脑白质切除术（复数） | Surgical procedures involving severing connections in the brain's prefrontal cortex.  This was once used to treat mental illness, but is now considered outdated and unethical due to its severe side effects. | Example: The unethical use of lobotomies in the mid-20th century is now widely condemned.  脑白质切除术在20世纪中叶的不道德使用现在受到广泛谴责。

The use of lobotomies was widespread from the 1930s to the 1950s as a treatment for various mental illnesses, including schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety disorders.  However,  the procedure often resulted in significant and irreversible cognitive and personality changes, such as apathy, emotional blunting, and impaired executive function.  As safer and more effective treatments emerged, lobotomies fell out of favor and are no longer performed.


近义词: prefrontal leucotomy (a more precise term), psychosurgery (a broader term)
反义词:  There isn't a direct antonym, but "modern psychiatric treatment" could be considered an opposite concept in terms of approach.
