词源:  The word "dissociability" is derived from the verb "dissociate," which itself comes from the Latin prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart" or "away") and the verb "associare" (meaning "to associate" or "to connect").  Therefore, "dissociability" literally means the state or quality of being separated or disconnected.  The psychological sense evolved from the understanding of mental processes separating from each other.
