PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "out-roguing."  The word itself is relatively uncommon.  Phrases would need to be built around it, for example:

*   a game of out-roguing (一场斗智斗勇的游戏)
*   attempting to out-rogue (试图胜过)
*   master of out-roguing (斗智斗勇的大师)
*   skilled at out-roguing (擅长玩弄权术)
*   the art of out-roguing (玩弄权术的艺术)


词源:  The word is a combination of "out-" (meaning to surpass or exceed) and "roguing" (from "rogue," meaning a dishonest or unprincipled person).  Therefore, the word is a relatively recent coinage, not found in traditional dictionaries.
