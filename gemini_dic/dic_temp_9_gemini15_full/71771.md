The word "fleapits" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a slang term, or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide a response in the requested format would be inaccurate and misleading.
