The word "nonprofit" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "profit" (meaning "advantage or gain resulting from an investment or transaction").  It emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as the concept of organizations dedicated to social causes and not focused on financial gain grew.

As an adjective, "nonprofit" describes the nature of an organization or activity. As a noun, it refers to the organization itself.
