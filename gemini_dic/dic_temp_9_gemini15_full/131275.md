noncausativeness:/ˌnɒnˌkɔːzəˈtɪvnəs/| n. |非致因性，非因果性 |The lack of a causative relationship; the state of not being caused.  This term is primarily used in linguistics, particularly in the study of verbs and their semantic properties.  A noncausative verb describes an action or state without implying that anything caused it. For example, "The flower bloomed" is noncausative, while "He bloomed the flower" is causative (he caused the flower to bloom).| The sentence "The glass broke" demonstrates noncausativeness; no agent is specified as causing the breakage.  In contrast, "John broke the glass" is causative, as John is the agent responsible for the action.|近义词：uncausality, nonagency |反义词：causativeness, agency |名词
