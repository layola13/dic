They are typically made of wood, stone, or concrete. Groynes are designed to slow down the movement of water and sediment along the coast, causing sediment to deposit on the updrift side and protecting the coast from erosion.|例句：The groynes along the beach have helped to prevent erosion.  海滩上的丁坝有助于防止侵蚀。|近义词：jetty, breakwater, revetment|反义词：None specifically, but methods that don't involve structures to interrupt sediment flow could be considered opposites.
