词源:
The word "operating" comes from the verb "operate," which ultimately derives from the Late Latin word "operari," meaning "to work," "to labor," or "to exert oneself."  This in turn has roots in the Latin "opus," meaning "work." The "-ing" suffix indicates the present participle, denoting an action in progress.
