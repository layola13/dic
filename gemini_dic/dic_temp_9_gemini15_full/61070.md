ellipse:/ɪˈlɪps/| n. |椭圆；椭圆形|A closed, oval-shaped curve;  a plane curve such that the sums of the distances from each point to two fixed points (the foci) is constant.  It is a conic section formed by intersecting a cone with a plane that is not parallel to the side of the cone.| The planet's orbit is an ellipse.  这个行星的轨道是椭圆形的。|circle, oval|straight line|名词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The ellipse represents a perfect oval shape. = 椭圆代表一个完美的椭圆形。
This ellipse is longer than that one. = 这个椭圆比那个长。


一般过去时:

The comet's path was an ellipse around the sun. = 彗星的运行轨迹是围绕太阳的椭圆形。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the properties of ellipses for centuries. = 科学家们已经研究了几个世纪的椭圆特性。
We have finally calculated the area of the ellipse. = 我们终于计算出了椭圆的面积。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, people had thought the orbit was a perfect circle, not an ellipse. = 在发现之前，人们认为轨道是完美的圆形，而不是椭圆形。
They had already completed the calculations for the ellipse's perimeter before the meeting. = 他们在会议前就已经完成了椭圆周长的计算。


将来时:
We will use an ellipse to model the planet's orbit. = 我们将用椭圆来模拟行星的轨道。
The students will learn about the properties of ellipses next week. = 学生们下周将学习椭圆的特性。


虚拟语气:
If the orbit were a perfect circle, the calculations would be much simpler. = 如果轨道是完美的圆形，计算就会简单得多。

否定句:
That shape is not an ellipse; it's a parabola. = 那个形状不是椭圆；它是抛物线。
The orbit is not a perfect ellipse; it is slightly irregular. = 轨道不是完美的椭圆；它略有不规则。

词源:

From Middle French *ellipse*, from Latin *ellipsis*, from Greek ἔλλειψις (élleipsis, "omission, defect, falling short"), from ἐλλείπειν (elleípein, "to fail, be deficient").  The geometrical meaning developed later, based on the idea that the ellipse is a "shortened" or "deficient" circle.
