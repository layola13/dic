词源:

The word is formed by combining:

* **non-**: a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of"
* **ponderously**:  an adverb meaning "in a heavy, labored way."  This in turn comes from "ponderous," an adjective meaning "heavy; unwieldy; dull."  The root ultimately traces back to the Latin word "pondus," meaning "weight."


Therefore, "nonponderously" means "not in a heavy or labored way," implying lightness, ease, and grace.
