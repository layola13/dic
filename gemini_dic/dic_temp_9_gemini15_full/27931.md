cantilever-bridge:/ˈkæntɪliːvər brɪdʒ/| n. |悬臂桥|A cantilever bridge is a bridge built using cantilevers, which are structures that extend horizontally into space, supported only at one end.  The cantilevers extend from each side of a central support, often meeting in the middle to form a continuous span. This design minimizes the need for intermediate supports in the main span.|Example: The Quebec Bridge is a famous example of a cantilever bridge.|近义词：suspension bridge (for similar function), beam bridge (for a contrasting design)|反义词：无
