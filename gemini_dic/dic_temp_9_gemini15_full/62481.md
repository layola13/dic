endospermic: /ˌɛndoʊˈspɜːrmɪk/ | adj. | 含胚乳的；胚乳性的 |  Having or relating to endosperm.  Endospermic seeds are those in which the endosperm is retained in the mature seed and provides nourishment to the developing embryo.  This contrasts with non-endospermic seeds, where the endosperm is absorbed by the embryo during development. | Example:  Maize is an endospermic plant, meaning its seeds contain endosperm that provides food for the developing seedling. 玉米是一种含胚乳的植物，这意味着它的种子含有为发育中的幼苗提供食物的胚乳。


|  Example:  Many monocotyledonous plants, such as grasses and orchids, produce endospermic seeds.  许多单子叶植物，如禾本科植物和兰科植物，都产生含胚乳的种子。| 近义词: albuminous (referring to seeds) | 反义词: non-endospermic, exalbuminous (referring to seeds) |
