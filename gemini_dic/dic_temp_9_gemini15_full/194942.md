词源:
The word "semi-manufacture" is a compound word.  "Semi-" is a prefix meaning "half" or "partly," derived from Latin "semi-," itself from the Greek "hēmi-". "Manufacture" comes from the Old French "manufacture," ultimately from Latin "manus" (hand) and "facere" (to make).  Therefore, semi-manufacture literally means "partly made by hand" although the modern usage doesn't necessarily imply hand-making.
