phanerodactyla: /ˌfænərəˈdæktɪlə/ | n. | 显指龙类 |  A group of extinct flying reptiles belonging to the order Pterosauria, characterized by their relatively large size and well-developed wings. They were diverse in form and occupied various ecological niches during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous periods.  |  The discovery of a new phanerodactyl species in the Morrison Formation provided valuable insights into the evolution of pterosaurs. 显指龙类在莫里森组的新物种发现为了解翼龙的进化提供了宝贵的见解。| 近义词: pterosaur (更广泛的分类) | 反义词: (无直接反义词，可考虑非翼龙类爬行动物) | 名词
