fluoresce:/ˌflʊəˈrɛs/| v.|发出荧光，荧光 |To emit light of visible wavelengths as a result of absorbing electromagnetic radiation of shorter wavelengths, such as ultraviolet or X-rays.|The mineral fluoresced brightly under ultraviolet light.  这种矿物在紫外线下发出明亮的荧光。|The dye solution fluoresced a brilliant green. 染料溶液发出鲜艳的绿色荧光。|磷光，发光 | phosphoresce, luminesce |  quench (in the sense of stopping fluorescence)


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The solution fluoresces brightly under UV light. = 溶液在紫外线下发出明亮的荧光。
This mineral fluoresces a vibrant blue. = 这种矿物发出鲜艳的蓝色荧光。


一般过去时:
The sample fluoresced strongly after irradiation. = 样品照射后发出强烈的荧光。
The dye fluoresced a pale yellow in the dark. = 染料在黑暗中发出浅黄色的荧光。


现在完成时:
The experiment has fluoresced consistently throughout the duration. = 实验期间荧光一直稳定地发出。
The material has fluoresced less intensely since the initial exposure. = 自首次曝光以来，该材料的荧光强度降低了。


过去完成时:
The liquid had fluoresced before the addition of the catalyst. = 在添加催化剂之前，液体就已经发出荧光了。
The substance had fluoresced brightly until it was contaminated. = 在被污染之前，该物质一直发出明亮的荧光。


将来时:
The compound will fluoresce when exposed to UV light. = 该化合物在暴露于紫外线下时将发出荧光。
The researchers predict the sample will fluoresce more intensely at lower temperatures. = 研究人员预测样品在较低温度下将发出更强的荧光。


虚拟语气:
If the substance were pure, it would fluoresce more effectively. = 如果物质是纯的，它会更有效地发出荧光。
I wish the dye fluoresced with a different color. = 我希望染料发出不同的颜色荧光。


被动语态:
The fluorescence was observed under a microscope. = 在显微镜下观察到荧光。
The sample was made to fluoresce by excitation with a laser. = 通过激光激发使样品发出荧光。


疑问句:
Does the solution fluoresce under visible light? = 该溶液在可见光下是否会发出荧光？
Why does this material fluoresce so brightly? = 为什么这种材料会发出如此明亮的荧光？


否定句:
The sample did not fluoresce after the treatment. = 处理后样品没有发出荧光。
The substance does not fluoresce in the absence of UV light. = 在没有紫外线的情况下，该物质不会发出荧光。
