kinglessness's:/ˈkɪŋlɪsnəsɪz/| n. |缺乏国王；无王状态的 |The word "kinglessness's" is a highly unusual and arguably ungrammatical formation.  It attempts to create a possessive form of the noun "kinglessness," which itself refers to the state of being without a king. The double possessive ('s) is awkward and rarely used in standard English.  A more natural way to express the concept would be to use phrases like "the state of kinglessness," or  "the effects of kinglessness."  Because of its unusual form and limited usage, there are no standard examples, synonyms, or antonyms readily available.  Its existence primarily highlights the complexities of English grammar and the limitations of mechanically applying grammatical rules. |There are no standard examples because this word is not commonly used.  A contrived example might be: "The kingdom's kinglessness's impact was felt throughout the land." (This sentence is grammatically awkward and unnatural.) |N/A |N/A |noun
