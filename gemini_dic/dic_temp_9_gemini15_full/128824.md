词源:
The word "nightmarish" is derived from "nightmare," which combines "night" and "mare."  "Mare" originally referred to a female demon or evil spirit believed to cause nightmares.  The "-ish" suffix adds a descriptive quality, meaning "like" or "characteristic of."  Therefore, "nightmarish" means "like a nightmare" or "resembling a nightmare."
