词源:

* **high:**  Old English *hēah*, meaning "high, tall, lofty."  This element contributes the sense of elevation and intensity of feeling.

* **spirited:** This part derives from the Old French *espirité*, ultimately from Latin *spiritus*, meaning "breath, spirit, soul." This indicates the inner liveliness and energy.  The suffix "-ed" transforms the noun "spirit" into an adjectival form.
