词源:

The word "hunkerousness" is not found in standard dictionaries and appears to be a relatively recent and informal coinage. It is likely derived from the verb "hunker," meaning to crouch or squat down, often as a defensive posture.  The "-ness" suffix transforms the verb into a noun signifying a state or quality.  The implied meaning suggests a stubborn refusal to move or yield, mirroring the physical act of huddling down in resistance.  The word's novelty limits formal etymological tracing.
