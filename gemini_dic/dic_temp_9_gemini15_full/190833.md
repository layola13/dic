USAGE->
This word, "sawm," doesn't lend itself to the grammatical structures shown in the example.  It's a noun, not a verb, and thus doesn't conjugate.  The example uses "what" for all tense and voice variations, which is inappropriate for analyzing a single noun.  I will instead provide example sentences demonstrating different ways "sawm" can be used.

Example Sentences with "sawm":

Simple Present Tense:  My sawm is going well this year.  今年我的斋戒进行得很顺利。
Simple Past Tense: He completed his sawm successfully. 他成功地完成了斋戒。
Future Tense: She will observe sawm next month. 她下个月将进行斋戒。
Present Continuous: I am keeping sawm during Ramadan. 我在斋月期间禁食。
Present Perfect: They have maintained their sawm throughout the month. 他们整个月都坚持斋戒。


PHRASE->

There are not many common phrases directly using "sawm"  as it's a relatively specific religious term.  However, here are some ways it might be used in a phrase:

breaking sawm:  开斋 (breaking the fast)
observing sawm:  遵守斋戒 (keeping the fast)
the month of sawm: 斋月 (the month of Ramadan)
the rules of sawm: 斋戒的规章 (the regulations of fasting)
during sawm:  斋戒期间 (during the fast)


注意事项:

The provided format is unsuitable for analyzing a single noun like "sawm". The grammatical structures (tense, voice, etc.) are relevant for verbs, not nouns.  The analysis has been adapted to fit the nature of the word.
