The word "reversis" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "reverse," "reverses," or a word from another language.  Please double-check your spelling.

* **A neologism or technical term:**  It could be a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field (e.g., a technical jargon). If this is the case, please provide more context about where you encountered this word.

* **A proper noun:**  It might be a name, a place, or a brand name. Again, context is crucial here.

Without further information, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  Please provide more context so I can help you.
