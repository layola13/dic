WORD ORIGIN->
The word "Celtics" derives from "Celt," referring to the Celtic peoples of Europe.  The term ultimately comes from the ancient Greek word "Keltoi," which was used to describe these tribes.  The suffix "-ics" denotes a collective or a body of people or things. Thus, "Celtics" refers to the people of Celtic origin, and in this context, specifically the basketball team drawing its name and identity from this heritage.
