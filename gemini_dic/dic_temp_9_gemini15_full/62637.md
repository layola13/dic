enfouldred: /ɪnˈfoʊldrəd/ | adj. | 包裹的；覆盖的；隐藏的 |  This word is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism or a misspelling.  It seems to be an attempt to combine elements suggesting "enfold" (to wrap or cover) and possibly "red" (referring to color or intensity). There is no established meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage is impossible.  It would need to be defined within a specific context before analysis is possible.
