词源:
The term "jump-start" is a relatively recent addition to the English language, emerging in the mid-20th century. It's a compound word, combining "jump" (referring to the act of quickly bridging a gap, in this case, the electrical gap in a dead battery) and "start" (to begin operating).  Its usage likely arose from the common practice of using jumper cables to start a car battery, creating a sudden surge of power that quickly initiates the engine.  The figurative extension to other areas, such as business or projects, followed naturally from this literal meaning.
