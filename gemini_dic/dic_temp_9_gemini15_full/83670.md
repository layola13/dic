The word "hafter" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific dialect or jargon, or a proper noun.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  To receive a response, please provide a correctly spelled word or clarify the context in which you encountered "hafter."
