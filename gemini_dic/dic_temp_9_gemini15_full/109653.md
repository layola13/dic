leucine: /ˈluːsiːn/ | n. |亮氨酸|Leucine is an essential branched-chain amino acid. It plays a crucial role in protein synthesis and muscle growth.  It's often found in protein-rich foods like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. |The body cannot produce leucine, so it must be obtained through diet. |近义词：isoleucine, valine (other branched-chain amino acids)|反义词：无|名词
