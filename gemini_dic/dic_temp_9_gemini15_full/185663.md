词源:

The word "reverentialness" is derived from the adjective "reverential," which in turn comes from the noun "reverence."  "Reverence" ultimately traces back to the Old French word "reverence," meaning "reverence, respect," which itself comes from the Latin verb "revereor," meaning "to stand in awe, to fear, to respect."  The suffix "-ness" is added to "reverential" to form the noun "reverentialness," indicating a state or quality.
