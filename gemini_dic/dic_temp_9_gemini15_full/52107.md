词源:

The idiom "diamond in the rough" originates from the literal meaning of a diamond in its natural, uncut state.  Before cutting and polishing, a rough diamond might appear dull and unattractive, but it possesses inherent value and beauty that is revealed only after refinement. The figurative use extends this idea to people with potential who need development or improvement to fully realize their abilities.
