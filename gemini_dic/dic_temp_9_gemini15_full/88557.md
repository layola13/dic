词源:
The word "hitch" ultimately derives from the Old Norse word "hikka," meaning "to catch or snatch."  The sense of "to fasten" developed from this earlier meaning, likely through the idea of catching or securing something. The surname "Hitchens" is a locational surname, likely originating from a place with a name containing the word "hitch," perhaps indicating a place where horses were frequently hitched.
