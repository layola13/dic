英文解析:

Facilenesses is the plural form of "facileness," meaning the state or quality of being facile.  Facile itself describes something that is easily done or achieved, often implying a lack of depth or thoroughness.  Therefore, facilesness refers to multiple instances or aspects of this ease or superficiality.


例句:

The facilesness with which he solved the problem was impressive, but also slightly worrying. 他解决问题的轻松程度令人印象深刻，但也略微令人担忧。


The facilesnesses of modern technology sometimes mask the complexities beneath. 现代技术的便利性有时掩盖了其背后的复杂性。


词源:

The word derives from the Latin "facilis," meaning "easy."  The suffix "-ness" is an English derivational suffix forming nouns of quality or state.


用法说明:

While "facileness" is relatively uncommon, "facilenesses" is even rarer.  It is generally used to emphasize multiple instances of ease or superficiality in a specific context.  It's important to note that because "facile" often carries a slightly negative connotation (suggesting something too easy or simplistic), "facilenesses" might also imply a lack of substance or thoroughness in multiple instances.  Consider using more common synonyms like "easinesses" or "simplicities" for clearer communication in most cases.
