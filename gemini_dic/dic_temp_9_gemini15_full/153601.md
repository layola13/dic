pentaptote: /ˈpentəpˌtoʊt/ | n. | 五格词 | A word that has five different forms in its declension or conjugation.  It's a term primarily used in classical Greek and Latin grammar to describe nouns, pronouns, and adjectives that exhibit five distinct case forms.  This contrasts with words that have fewer forms due to case syncretism (where different grammatical cases share the same form).  The term is less frequently used in modern linguistics, as many languages don't have such a rich system of inflection. |  The Greek word *pentas* meaning "five" and the word *ptotos* meaning "fallen" (referencing the declension of cases).|  There are no common examples of pentaptotes in modern English, as English has largely lost its case system.  The term is mainly relevant for the study of classical languages.  | 近义词:  (no direct equivalent in modern English usage)| 反义词: (no direct antonym)|  词性: noun
