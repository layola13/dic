词源:

The word "imagination" comes from the Middle English word "imaginacioun," which in turn derives from the Old French word "imaginacion" and ultimately from the Latin word "imaginatio."  The Latin root is "imaginari," meaning "to form a mental image," which combines "imago" (image) and the verb suffix "-ari" (to do, to make).
