词源:
The word "influxively" is derived from the noun "influx," meaning "a flowing or pouring in," and the suffix "-ive," which forms adjectives meaning "having the nature of" or "tending to."  Therefore, "influxively" describes something characterized by a large influx.  The ultimate origin of "influx" lies in the Latin prefix "in-" (into) and the verb "fluere" (to flow).
