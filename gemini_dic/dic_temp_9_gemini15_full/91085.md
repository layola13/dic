The word "huus" is not a recognized word in English.  There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a word from another language:  If it's from another language, please specify the language so I can try to help.
* It's a newly coined word or slang:  If it's a very recent addition to the lexicon, it might not be in dictionaries yet.
* It's a proper noun: If it's a name or place name, please provide more context.


Please provide more information so I can assist you.
