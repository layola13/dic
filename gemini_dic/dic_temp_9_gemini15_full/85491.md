The word "hastated" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need a correctly spelled word.  If you can provide the intended word, I will be happy to provide the analysis in the requested format.
