词源:
The word "psychos" is a shortened, informal version of "psychopaths"  or "psychotics".  "Psycho" itself comes from the Greek word "psyche," meaning "soul" or "mind," combined with the suffix "-path" (from "pathos," meaning "suffering" or "disease"). Thus, it literally refers to someone with a diseased mind.
