词源:
reduces comes from the Old French "reduire", meaning "to lead back, bring back, restore".  It ultimately derives from the Latin "reducere,"  a compound of "re-" (back, again) and "ducere" (to lead).  The meaning evolved from the original sense of "leading back" to encompass the modern sense of lessening or diminishing something.
