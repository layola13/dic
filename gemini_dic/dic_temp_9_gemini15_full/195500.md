词源:  The word is a combination of "semi-" (meaning half or partly) and "paganish" (a less common variant of "pagan," suggesting a somewhat informal or less intense form of paganism).  "Pagan" itself originates from the Latin word "paganus," referring to a country dweller or rustic. In the context of religion, it came to denote those who were not Christian, particularly those who followed polytheistic religions.
