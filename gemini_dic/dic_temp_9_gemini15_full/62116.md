USAGE->
This word is quite rare and doesn't have a wide range of grammatical usages like common verbs or nouns.  Its usage is primarily limited to descriptive contexts as an adjective (though it functions nominally here) where it implies the superlative form of richness or fullness.  Therefore, tense conjugations are not applicable.  It is typically used in declarative sentences.


PHRASE->
There are no common set phrases using "enchest".  The word itself is a somewhat archaic or literary term.
