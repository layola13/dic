词源:

The word "pawpaw" for the North American fruit is of Native American origin.  The word's etymology traces back to Algonquian languages.

The word "pawpaw" for the tropical papaya is believed to be derived from the Spanish word "papaya," which in turn has roots in the Taino language of the Caribbean.  The similarity in names has led to confusion, but they are distinct fruits.
