The word "columbatz" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specific dialect or jargon.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  To offer help, I need more context.  Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the source might help determine its meaning and origin.
