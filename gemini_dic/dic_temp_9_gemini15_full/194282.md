self-operator:/ˌsɛlfˈɑːpəreɪtər/| n. |自操作符|A self-operator is a programming term referring to an operator that operates on a single operand (itself).  It's often used in contexts where a value needs to be modified in place, or where the operator's action is intrinsically linked to a single variable or object.|Example: In many programming languages, the `++` (increment) and `--` (decrement) operators are self-operators.  `x++` increases the value of `x` by 1.|近义词:unary operator|反义词:binary operator, ternary operator


USAGE->
This term is primarily used within the context of programming and does not have typical grammatical tense variations like verbs.  Instead, its usage depends on the specific programming language and its syntax.


Example 1 (C++):
int x = 5;
x++; // x now equals 6.  The ++ operator is a self-operator acting on x. =  x的值现在为6。++运算符是作用于x的自运算符。

Example 2 (Python):
x = 5
x += 1 # x now equals 6.  While not strictly a "self-operator" in the same way as ++, it modifies x in place. = x的值现在为6。虽然不像++那样严格意义上的“自运算符”，但它就地修改了x。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly associated with "self-operator." The term is highly technical and used within specific programming contexts.
