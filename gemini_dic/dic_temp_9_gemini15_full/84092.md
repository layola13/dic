词源：

The word is a combination of "half," indicating incompleteness or a partial nature, and "ingenuousness," which derives from the Latin "ingenuus," meaning "free-born," "noble," and by extension, "frank," "candid," or "innocent."  The meaning shifted over time to emphasize the quality of being naturally innocent or naive.  The prefix "half-" creates an ironic contrast, suggesting a facade rather than genuine innocence.


用法说明:

This word is relatively rare and primarily used in literary contexts or when a nuanced description is required to capture the deceitful nature of someone's apparent innocence.  It carries a negative connotation, implying a lack of genuine simplicity or honesty.  It's not a common word in everyday conversation.  The word highlights the contrast between the outward appearance of innocence and the underlying intention to deceive.
