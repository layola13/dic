The word "nonsubsistences" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  However, we can break down the components to understand its potential meaning:

* **non-:**  /nɑːn/ | Prefix | 非，不 |  This is a common prefix indicating negation or absence.

* **subsistence:** /səbˈsɪstəns/ | Noun | 生存，生计，维持生活所需 | The means of supporting oneself, especially financially; the minimal amount needed to sustain life.


Therefore, "nonsubsistences" would likely mean the *absence* or *lack of subsistence*, or things that do not provide for subsistence. It might also refer to activities or situations that prevent subsistence.  However, without context or a clearer understanding of its intended usage, its meaning remains ambiguous and speculative.  To provide a full analysis as requested, a valid word or a sentence using the term is necessary.
