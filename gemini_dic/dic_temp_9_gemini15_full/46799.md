The word "danis" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (perhaps a name), or a word from a non-English language.  To provide the requested analysis, I need a correctly spelled word or more context.
