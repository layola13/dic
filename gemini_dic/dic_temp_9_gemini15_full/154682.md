词源:
personification comes from the Late Middle English word *personificacioun*, derived from the Latin word *personificatio*, meaning "the act of personifying".  The word *persona* means "mask" or "character" in Latin, and *facere* means "to make" or "to do".  Therefore, the word literally means "the act of making into a person".
