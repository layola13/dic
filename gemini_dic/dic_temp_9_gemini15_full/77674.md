geloscopy:/dʒɛˈlɒskəpi/ | n. | 胶体镜检法 | The study of colloids using a microscope.  Geloscopy is a technique used to examine the properties and behavior of colloids, which are mixtures of substances where one substance is dispersed evenly throughout another.  This involves microscopic observation of the particles' size, shape, and distribution within the medium. |Example:  Researchers used geloscopy to analyze the particle size distribution in the newly synthesized hydrogel.  研究人员利用胶体镜检法分析了新合成的水凝胶的粒度分布。|近义词：colloid microscopy, micellar analysis |反义词：macroscopic analysis |名词


USAGE->
This word is quite specific and doesn't lend itself to common grammatical usage examples in the same way as a common word like "what".  The grammatical structures used would be typical of scientific writing describing experiments and observations.  Here are examples using different tenses in the context of geloscopy:


一般现在时:
Geloscopy reveals important information about the structure of colloids. = 胶体镜检法揭示了关于胶体结构的重要信息。
We use geloscopy to study the dynamics of particle aggregation. = 我们使用胶体镜检法研究颗粒聚集的动态。


一般过去时:
The researchers performed geloscopy to characterize the sample. = 研究人员进行了胶体镜检法来表征样品。
Geloscopy analysis showed a significant difference between the two samples. = 胶体镜检法分析显示两个样品之间存在显著差异。


现在完成时:
Scientists have used geloscopy for decades to study colloid systems. = 科学家们几十年来一直使用胶体镜检法研究胶体系统。
Researchers have completed the geloscopy analysis and presented their findings. = 研究人员完成了胶体镜检法分析并提交了他们的研究结果。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had prepared the samples for geloscopy. = 在实验之前，他们已经为胶体镜检法准备了样品。
The scientists had already conducted geloscopy on similar materials. = 科学家们已经对类似的材料进行了胶体镜检法分析。


将来时:
We will use geloscopy to investigate the effects of temperature on the colloid. = 我们将使用胶体镜检法研究温度对胶体的影响。
The team will perform geloscopy next week to analyze the new material. = 该团队将于下周进行胶体镜检法分析新材料。


被动语态:
The samples were analyzed using geloscopy. = 样品是用胶体镜检法分析的。
The geloscopy results were carefully reviewed by the team. = 胶体镜检法的结果被团队仔细审查。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly associated with "geloscopy" as it's a highly technical term.  Phrases would be specific to the scientific context and would involve other technical terms.  Examples could include:
"geloscopy imaging", "geloscopy analysis", "dynamic light scattering and geloscopy", "high-resolution geloscopy",  "quantitative geloscopy".
