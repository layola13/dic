carburizations:/ˌkɑːrbəraɪˈzeɪʃənz/| n. |渗碳作用；渗碳处理|The process of increasing the carbon content of a metal, usually steel, by heating it in a carbon-rich environment. This process enhances the metal's hardness and wear resistance.  |Example: The carburizations of the steel gears improved their durability significantly.  渗碳处理使钢制齿轮的耐用性显著提高。|近义词：case hardening, carbonizing |反义词：decarburization
