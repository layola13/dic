USAGE->

一般现在时:
The nonelusivenesses of the instructions are appreciated. = 指示的清晰易懂深受赞赏。
His explanations lack nonelusivenesses. = 他的解释缺乏清晰易懂。


一般过去时:

PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "nonelusivenesses" as it's an extremely rare and artificially constructed word.


词源:

The word is formed by combining several morphemes:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not."
* **elusive**: An adjective meaning "difficult to find, catch, or achieve."
* **-ness**: A suffix that turns an adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality.
* **-es**: A plural suffix.

Therefore, "nonelusivenesses" literally means "the multiple instances of not being difficult to find, catch, or achieve."  The word's structure shows it's a highly formal and scholarly construction, unlikely to appear in casual conversation or writing.
