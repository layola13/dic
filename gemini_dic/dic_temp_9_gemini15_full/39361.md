/kɒndʒuːɡeɪtˈnɛsɪz/ | n. | 结合性；共轭性 |  The word "conjugatenesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to "conjugate," attempting to create a plural noun form suggesting multiple instances of conjugation or interconnected conjugated states.  There is no established meaning or usage in dictionaries or standard English literature.  Its meaning would depend entirely on the context in which it's used.  It might refer to multiple instances of grammatical conjugation (of verbs), or perhaps to multiple instances of something being conjugated in a scientific or mathematical context (e.g., complex numbers). |  Example: (Hypothetical) "The various conjugatenesses of the verb 'to be' were explored in the grammar lesson."  (This sentence uses the word in a way consistent with its possible derivation, but it's still unconventional.) |  N/A | N/A | noun
