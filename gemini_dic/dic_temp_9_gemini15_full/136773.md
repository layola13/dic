nonseraphic: /ˌnɒn.səˈræfɪk/ | adj. | 非天使般的；非天真的；世俗的 | Not angelic or seraphic; earthly or worldly.  The word suggests a lack of the innocence, purity, or celestial beauty associated with angels. |  例句：His nonseraphic behavior at the party shocked everyone.  他的行为举止在派对上让每个人都震惊了。


例句：The painting, while beautiful, had a distinctly nonseraphic quality, depicting earthly pleasures rather than heavenly scenes. 这幅画虽然很美，但却有一种明显非天使般的品质，描绘的是尘世的快乐而不是天堂的景象。


近义词：worldly, earthly, mundane, unsaintly, human


反义词：angelic, seraphic, heavenly, celestial, divine


词源：The word is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "seraphic," which is derived from the word "seraph," a type of angel in Christian theology.  Therefore, "nonseraphic" literally means "not like a seraph."
