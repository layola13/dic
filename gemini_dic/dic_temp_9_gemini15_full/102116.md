isotonicities:/ˌaɪsoʊtɒˈnɪsətiz/ | n. | 等渗性；等张性 | The state of having equal osmotic pressure.  It refers to solutions with the same concentration of solutes, preventing osmosis.  This is crucial in various biological contexts, ensuring proper cell function. | Example: Maintaining the isotonicities of intravenous fluids is vital for patient safety.  维持静脉输液的等渗性对患者安全至关重要。 |近义词: osmotic equilibrium, isomolarity |反义词: hypertonicity, hypotonicity | 名词
