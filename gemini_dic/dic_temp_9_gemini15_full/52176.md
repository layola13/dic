The word "diara" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis with pronunciation, etymology, usage, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  To provide such an analysis, I would need a word that exists in the English language.  If you have a different word in mind, please provide it.
