词源:  The word "impatient" comes from the Old French word "impatient," which itself derives from the Latin word "impatiens," meaning "not suffering."  The prefix "im-" means "not," and "patiens" is the present participle of "pati," meaning "to suffer" or "to endure."  Therefore, the original meaning of "impatient" was "not enduring" or "unable to bear."  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the modern sense of being easily frustrated by delays.
