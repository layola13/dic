The word "medeski" does not appear to be a word in standard English dictionaries or common usage.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's likely a proper noun (a name), a misspelling, or a word from a specialized or technical field not widely known.  To provide the requested analysis, I need more context about where you encountered this word.
