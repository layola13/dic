词源:

The word "exchange" comes from the Old French word "eschange," which itself derives from the Late Latin word "excambium."  This Latin word is a compound of "ex-" (out, from) and "cambium" (exchange, barter).  The root meaning therefore points to the act of giving something "out" in order to receive something "in return."
