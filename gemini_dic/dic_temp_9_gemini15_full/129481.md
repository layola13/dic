反义词：amenable, cooperative, compliant, docile, tractable


词源：

The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "amenable," which derives from the Old French "amenable," meaning "easily led or managed," ultimately from the Latin "ad-" (to) + "menare" (to lead).  Therefore, "non-amenable" literally means "not easily led or managed."
