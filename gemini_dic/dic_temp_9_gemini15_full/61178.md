词源:
The word "elucubration" comes from the Latin word "elucubrare," which means "to work by candlelight,"  implying late-night study or intense intellectual effort.  The "eluc" part is related to the Latin "lux," meaning "light," and "cubare," meaning "to lie down" or "to rest," suggesting the act of working late into the night.
