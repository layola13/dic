词源:
The word "maltreated" comes from the prefix "mal-" (meaning bad or ill) + "treated".  "Treated" is the past participle of the verb "to treat," ultimately deriving from the Old French "traiter" and the Latin "tractare" (to handle, manage, treat).  Therefore, "maltreated" literally means "badly handled" or "badly treated."
