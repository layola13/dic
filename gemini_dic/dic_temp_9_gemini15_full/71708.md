词源:
The word "flavor" comes from the Old French "flavor," meaning "smell, taste, odor."  This in turn derives from the Latin "flavus," meaning "yellow," likely because many flavorful substances have a yellowish hue.  The shift from color to taste and smell reflects a common semantic drift in language.
