词源:
The word "philandering" ultimately derives from the Greek word "philos" (φιλος), meaning "loving," and possibly a connection to the verb "andreia" (ανδρεία) signifying "manliness" or "courage," although this latter connection is debated.  Over time, the word evolved to refer specifically to a man's romantic adventures and infidelity, taking on its current negative connotation.
