词源:
The word "curtaining" comes directly from the noun "curtain," ultimately deriving from the Old French "cortine," meaning "curtain."  The "cortine" itself likely originates from the Latin "cortina," which referred to a hanging screen or curtain.  The "-ing" suffix transforms the noun into a gerund, indicating the action or process of using curtains.
