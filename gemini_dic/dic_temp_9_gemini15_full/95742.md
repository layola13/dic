词源:

The word "inconsistency" comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") + "consistency" (meaning "the state of being consistent").  "Consistency" itself derives from the Latin word "consistere," meaning "to stand together."  Therefore, "inconsistency" literally means "not standing together" or "lack of agreement."

* **Lack of uniformity or regularity:**  There might be inconsistencies in a system or process if it doesn't follow a predictable pattern.
