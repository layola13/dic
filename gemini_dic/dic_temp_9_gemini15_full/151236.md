parenchymous: /pəˈrɛŋkɪməs/ | adj. | 薄壁组织的；实质的 | Relating to or denoting parenchyma.  Parenchyma is a fundamental tissue in plants and animals, consisting of relatively unspecialized cells. In plants, it forms the bulk of leaves, flowers, fruits, and stems, and functions in photosynthesis, storage, and other vital processes. In animals, parenchyma forms the functional parts of organs such as the liver and kidneys. |  The leaf's structure is largely parenchymatous, enabling efficient photosynthesis.  叶子的结构主要由薄壁组织构成，从而实现高效的光合作用。| spongy, cellular | sclerenchymatous
