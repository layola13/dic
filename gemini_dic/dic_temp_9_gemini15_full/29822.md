词源：
The word "cauliflower" comes from the Old French "chou-fleur," literally meaning "cabbage flower."  "Chou" is from the Latin "caulis," meaning "stem" or "stalk," and "fleur" is the French word for "flower."  The word evolved through Middle English forms before settling into its modern spelling.
