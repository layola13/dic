词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in front of"), the noun "tension" (derived from the Latin "tendere," meaning "to stretch"), and the suffix "-less" (meaning "without").  The word "pretension" originally referred to a claim or assertion, often one that is exaggerated or unfounded.  Over time, it came to describe an affected or artificial display of importance or superiority. Therefore, "pretensionless" means lacking such an affected display.
