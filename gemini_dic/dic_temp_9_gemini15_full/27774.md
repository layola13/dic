词源:

The word "cannibalising" derives from "cannibal," ultimately from the Spanish word *caníbal*, which in turn comes from the Carib language, referring to the Carib people, who were wrongly believed by early European explorers to practice cannibalism.  The suffix "-ising" indicates the process or act of doing something.
