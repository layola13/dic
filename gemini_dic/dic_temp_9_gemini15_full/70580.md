词源:
The word "filling" derives from the verb "to fill," which has Old English roots in "fyllan," meaning "to fill, complete, fulfill."  This ultimately traces back to Proto-Germanic roots and shares etymological connections with other Germanic languages.  The noun "filling" emerged as a natural extension of the verb's meaning, referring to the material used to fill something or the action of filling itself.
