词源:

* **cross:**  From Old English *crūcian, *crūsian, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch kruisen and German kreuzen, from a base meaning “to mark with a cross.”  The sense of "to go across" developed later.

* **boundary:** From Middle English bounde, from Old French bounde, from Old North French bonde, from Vulgar Latin *bunda, from Latin *bundus, a derivative of *bindere "to bind."  A boundary is something that binds or limits.
