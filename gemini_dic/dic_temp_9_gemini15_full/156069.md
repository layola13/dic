photopolymerize:/ˌfoʊtoʊpɑːləməraɪz/ | v. | 光聚合 | To undergo polymerization induced by light. This process involves the use of light to initiate a chemical reaction that causes monomers (small molecules) to link together to form polymers (large molecules).  The resulting polymer often changes its physical properties, such as becoming solid or changing its shape. | Example:  The resin photopolymerizes rapidly under UV light.  紫外线下树脂快速光聚合。The 3D printer uses a photopolymerization process to create the object. 这台3D打印机使用光聚合工艺来创建物体。| 近义词：polymerize (under light), photocure | 反义词：depolymerize
