词源:

The word derives from "plodding," which in turn comes from the Middle English word "plodden," meaning "to walk heavily or slowly."  The suffix "-ness" indicates a state or quality.  Therefore, "ploddingnesses" signifies multiple instances or examples of this slow, heavy, and often monotonous movement or activity.


用法说明:

"Ploddingnesses" is a relatively uncommon word and is used primarily in formal writing to emphasize the repetitive and tedious nature of actions or movements.  It’s used to describe a series of slow, laborious activities or movements that lack excitement or dynamism.  Due to its somewhat cumbersome nature, simpler alternatives like "tedium," "monotony," or "drudgery" are often preferred.
