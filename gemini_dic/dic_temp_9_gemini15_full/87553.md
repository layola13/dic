/ˌhɛtərəʊmaɪˈeəriə/ | n. |异肌性|Heteromyaria refers to a condition or characteristic of having muscles arranged differently from the typical or expected pattern.  This term is primarily used in zoology and comparative anatomy, often in the context of mollusks and their shell structure.  It describes variations in the arrangement and function of the muscles responsible for shell movement and other bodily functions. The specific variations can be complex and depend on the species and the evolutionary adaptations of the organism.|The unusual heteromyaria of this mollusk species is believed to be an adaptation to its unique lifestyle in the deep sea.|近义词: muscular anomaly, atypical musculature|反义词: isomyaria (typical muscle arrangement)

Example 1:
The researchers observed significant heteromyaria in the specimens collected from the hydrothermal vent, suggesting a novel adaptation to the extreme environment. = 研究人员在从热液喷口采集的样本中观察到明显的异肌性，这表明对极端环境的一种新的适应。


Example 2:
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that heteromyaria evolved independently in several lineages of bivalves. = 系统发育分析显示，异肌性在几个双壳类动物谱系中独立进化。


PHRASE->
This term does not commonly appear in phrases.  It is primarily used as a standalone descriptive term in zoological and anatomical contexts.
