词源:
The word "clamber" ultimately derives from the Old French word "cambrer," meaning "to arch" or "to bend."  This suggests an image of a body bending and stretching while climbing, reflecting the awkwardness often associated with the action.  The word evolved through Middle English and gradually acquired its current meaning.
