decahedrons:/ˌdekəˈhiːdrɒnz/| n. | 十面体 | A decahedron is a three-dimensional geometric shape with ten flat faces.  It can be regular (all faces are congruent regular polygons) or irregular (faces are not all congruent).| Example:  The crystal structure exhibited a complex arrangement of decahedrons.  这个晶体结构展现出复杂的多面体排列。 |近义词:polyhedron|反义词:  None (antonyms are not applicable to geometric shapes in this context).
