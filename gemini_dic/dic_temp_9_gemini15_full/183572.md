词源：
The word "requickening" is formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") to the word "quickening," which itself derives from the Old English word "cwician" meaning "to come to life" or "to revive."  Thus, "requickening" literally means "to come to life again" or "to revive again".
