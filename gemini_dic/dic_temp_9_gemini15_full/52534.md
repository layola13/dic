词源:
The word "difficulty" comes from the Old French word "difficulté," which itself is derived from the Latin word "difficultas."  "Difficultas" is formed from "difficilis," meaning "hard to do," which is a combination of "dis-" (meaning "not" or "un-") and "facilis" (meaning "easy").  Therefore, "difficulty" literally means "the state of being hard to do."
