词源:

The word "nonapologetical" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "apologetical" (relating to apology).  "Apologetical" itself comes from the Greek word "apologia" (ἀπολογία), meaning "defense," "apology," or "explanation."  Therefore, "nonapologetical" literally means "not relating to an apology" or "not apologetic."
