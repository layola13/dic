Etymology:

The word "numinous" originates from the Latin word "numen," meaning "divine power," "spirit," or "deity."  The modern English adjective "numinous" was coined in the late 19th century by the German theologian Rudolf Otto in his influential work *Das Heilige* (The Idea of the Holy). Otto used the term to describe the feeling of encountering something wholly other, something that transcends ordinary human experience and evokes a sense of awe, mystery, and fascination.  The word quickly gained acceptance in English and other languages, becoming a key term in religious studies, theology, and related fields.
