preevidences:/ˌpriːˈɛvɪdənsɪz/ | n. | 预先证据；初步证据 |  This word is not a standard English word. It appears to be a blend or misspelling of "pre-evidence" or a similar construction.  It would likely refer to evidence gathered or considered before a formal investigation or trial.  There is no established definition or usage.  To use this effectively, it would need to be defined within the context where it is used. |  Example: The preevidences suggested a connection between the two suspects, prompting a full investigation. (This sentence uses the word in a made-up context.) | 近义词: preliminary evidence, initial evidence, prior indications | 反义词: conclusive evidence, final proof | 名词
