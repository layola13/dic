ichthyopsida:/ɪkθiˈɒpsɪdə/| n. | 鱼形纲 | A class of vertebrates that includes fishes and their close relatives, characterized by gills and fins.  Ichthyopsida is a largely obsolete classification, now considered paraphyletic. The group once encompassed various aquatic vertebrates, including fishes, amphibians, and sometimes even reptiles.  However, modern phylogenetic analyses show that these groups are not closely related in a monophyletic way. | Example:  The classification of Ichthyopsida, while historically significant, is no longer used in modern taxonomy. = 鱼形纲的分类，虽然在历史上很重要，但在现代分类学中已不再使用。| 近义词:  (Historically) Pisces (but with broader scope),  Amphibia (partially overlapping),  Reptilia (partially overlapping) | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, as it's a taxonomic group) | 名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a historical or comparative context within discussions of taxonomy and evolutionary biology, not in everyday language.  Therefore, providing examples in various grammatical tenses is less relevant than explaining its usage within specific scientific contexts.

Example 1 (Simple Past):  Scientists once believed that ichthyopsida represented a natural grouping of aquatic vertebrates. = 科学家曾经认为鱼形纲代表了水生脊椎动物的一个自然类群。

Example 2 (Present Perfect):  Research has shown that the ichthyopsida classification is paraphyletic and therefore invalid. = 研究表明，鱼形纲分类是并系的，因此是无效的。


PHRASE->
This term is not typically used in phrases in everyday language.  Its usage is restricted to scientific literature and discussions.  Therefore, providing common phrases is inappropriate.
