depolarize:/ˌdiːˈpoʊləraɪz/ | vt. | 去极化；消除极性 | To remove the polarization of (something, especially a cell membrane).  This typically involves a change in electrical potential.  The process is crucial in various biological and chemical contexts, including nerve impulse transmission and muscle contraction. |  例句：The influx of sodium ions depolarizes the neuron's membrane.  钠离子内流使神经元的膜去极化。

The drug depolarizes the muscle fibers, causing paralysis.  这种药物使肌肉纤维去极化，导致瘫痪。


近义词：dispolarize, neutralize


反义词：polarize

词源:
The word "depolarize" is formed from the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse"),  "polar" (referring to the poles or opposite charges), and the suffix "-ize" (meaning "to cause to become").  Therefore, "depolarize" literally means "to remove or reverse the polarization."
