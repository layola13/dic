词源:  Derived from the adjective "composed," meaning calm and serene. The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality.  The plural "composednesses" suggests multiple instances or different facets of this state.  Ultimately, it traces back to the Latin "compōnere," meaning "to put together," implying a state of having one's thoughts and feelings put together in an orderly and calm manner.
