词源:  Derived from the verb "intrude," which comes from the Old French word "intruder," meaning "to thrust in" or "to enter without permission."  The suffix "-ingly" transforms the verb into an adverb, modifying other words to indicate the manner in which the action is performed.  Therefore, "intrudingly" describes an action done in an intrusive manner.
