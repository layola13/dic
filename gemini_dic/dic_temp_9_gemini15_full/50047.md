词源:
The word "denouement" comes from the French word "dénouement," which literally means "untying" or "unraveling."  It ultimately derives from the Old French "desnouer," meaning "to untie a knot."  This reflects its use in literature and drama to describe the untangling of the plot's complexities and the resolution of conflicts.
