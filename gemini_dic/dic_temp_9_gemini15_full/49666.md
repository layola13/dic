词源:
The word "demisemiquaver" is a combination of several musical terms derived from Latin and French.  "Demi" (from Latin "dimidius") means half, "semi" (from Latin "semi") means half, and "quaver" (from French "quaver") refers to a musical note.  Therefore, it literally means "half of a half of a quaver," resulting in a 1/16 note.
