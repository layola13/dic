protista:/proʊˈtɪstə/| n. |原生生物；原生动物 |Protista is a kingdom of eukaryotic organisms that are not animals, plants, or fungi.  They are mostly single-celled organisms, but some are multicellular. Protists are a diverse group, and their characteristics vary widely.  They can be found in a variety of habitats, including soil, water, and the bodies of other organisms. | Example:  Many protists are microscopic and live in aquatic environments.  许多原生生物是微观的，生活在水生环境中。  |近义词：protoctist |反义词：N/A
