The word "manred" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a proper noun (like a name), or a word from a specific jargon or dialect.  To provide a meaningful response, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?**  Knowing the source (book, website, conversation) will help determine its meaning and usage.
* **What was the surrounding text?** The sentences before and after the word might provide clues to its intended meaning.


Without this additional information, I cannot fulfill your request.  If you can provide more context, I'll be happy to help.
