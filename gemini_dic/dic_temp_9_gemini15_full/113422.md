From "lymphocyte" + "-ic" (suffix indicating relating to or characterized by).  "Lymphocyte" itself comes from "lymph" (clear fluid in the lymphatic system) + "-cyte" (suffix meaning cell).  The ultimate roots are in Classical Greek:  "lymph" from Latin "lympha" (pure water), possibly ultimately from Greek "nymphe" (nymph, a water spirit) ;  "-cyte" from Greek "kytos" (cell, hollow vessel).
