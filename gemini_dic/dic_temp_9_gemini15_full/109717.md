词源:
The word "leveled-off" is a past participle form of the phrasal verb "level off," combining the verb "level" (meaning to make something flat or even) and the preposition "off" (indicating a cessation or completion).  The sense of "level off" evolved from the literal meaning of making something flat to the metaphorical meaning of achieving a stable state.
