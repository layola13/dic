词源:

* **over-**:  prefix indicating excess or too much. (表示过度或太多)
* **covet-**: from Old French *coveiter*, from Latin *cupere* "to desire." (源于古法语coveiter，来自拉丁语cupere "渴望")
* **-ousness**: suffix forming nouns indicating a quality or state. (构成名词的后缀，表示品质或状态)


Therefore, overcovetousness literally means "the state of excessively coveting." (因此，贪得无厌字面意思是“过度渴望的状态”)
