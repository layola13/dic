The word "misboden" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Perhaps provide more context where you encountered this word.

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** A newly coined word not yet widely used.

3. **It's from another language:** It might be a word from German or another language. If you can provide the language of origin, a translation could be offered.
