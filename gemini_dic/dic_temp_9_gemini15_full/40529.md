词源:

The word "controlling" derives from the verb "control," which itself originates from the Old French word "controller," meaning "to check, verify."  This further stems from the Medieval Latin "contra rotulus," meaning "counter-roll," referring to a duplicate roll used for checking accounts.  The suffix "-ing" transforms the verb into its adjectival form, signifying the act or state of controlling.
