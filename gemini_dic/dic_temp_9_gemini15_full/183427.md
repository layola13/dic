PHRASE->
(There aren't many common idiomatic phrases directly using "reprovers."  The word itself is less frequently used in everyday speech than its synonyms.)  Instead, we can illustrate phrases related to the *act* of reproving:

to reprove someone sharply = 严厉地责备某人
to offer gentle reproof = 给予温和的责备
to receive reproof with grace = 优雅地接受责备
to deserve reproof = 应该受到责备
to issue a reproof = 发出谴责


词源:  The word "reprover" comes from the verb "reprove," which is formed from the Old French "reprover" and ultimately from the Latin "reprobare," meaning "to disapprove, to reject." The prefix "re-" means "again," and the root "-probare" is related to "probus," meaning "good," thus implying a sense of testing or judging against a standard of goodness.
