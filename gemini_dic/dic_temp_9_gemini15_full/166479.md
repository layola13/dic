preromantic: /ˌpriːroʊˈmænɪk/ | adj. | 前浪漫主义的 |  Pre-Romantic refers to a period in European art, literature, and music that bridges the gap between the Enlightenment and Romanticism, roughly spanning the late 18th century. It's characterized by a growing emphasis on emotion, individualism, and the sublime, though not to the same extent as full-blown Romanticism.  It often foreshadows Romantic themes but retains some characteristics of the preceding Classical or Neoclassical styles. |  The paintings of Caspar David Friedrich show some preromantic elements. | 近义词: proto-Romantic, pre-Romantic | 反义词: Romantic, Classical, Neoclassical
