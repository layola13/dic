The word "dsis" is not a recognized word in standard English.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or looking word?
* **A technical term or abbreviation:** It might be specific to a certain field or context. If you can provide more context (e.g., where you encountered this word), I might be able to help.
* **A newly coined word or slang:**  If it's a newly invented word, there's no existing information.
