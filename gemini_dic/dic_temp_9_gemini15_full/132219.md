词源:

The word "nondecadent" is a compound word formed from "non-" (meaning "not") and "decadent" (meaning "characterized by or indicative of moral or cultural decline").  "Decadent" itself has roots in the Latin word "decadens," the present participle of "decadere," meaning "to fall down" or "to decline."  Therefore, "nondecadent" literally means "not falling down" or "not declining" in a moral or cultural sense.
