quasi-disadvantageously: /ˈkwɑːzaɪˌdɪsədˌvæntˈeɪdʒəsli/ | adj. | 准劣势地，似有不利地 |

英文解析：The word "quasi-disadvantageously" combines the prefix "quasi-" (meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent") with the adverb "disadvantageously" (meaning "in a way that puts someone or something at a disadvantage").  Therefore, it describes a situation or condition that appears to be or has some aspects of being disadvantageous, but not necessarily completely or definitively so.  It suggests a subtle or partial disadvantage.
