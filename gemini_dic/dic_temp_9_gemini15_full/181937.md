词源:
The word "remark" comes from the Old French word "remarquer," which means "to notice," "to mark again," or "to take note of."  This in turn derives from the Old French prefix "re-" (again) and the verb "marquer" (to mark).  The meaning evolved to encompass both the act of noticing and the statement made about what was noticed.
