词源:
The word "overstout" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the adjective "stout" (meaning "strong," "sturdy," or "thick").  Therefore, it literally means "excessively stout."  The etymology of "stout" itself traces back to Old English *stūtan, meaning "to push" or "to thrust," reflecting the inherent strength implied by the word.
