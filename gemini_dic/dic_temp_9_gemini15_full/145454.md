词源:

The word is formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great degree) and the noun "civilities," which itself comes from the adjective "civil" (meaning polite, courteous). "Civilities" refers to polite acts or expressions. Therefore, "overcivilities" literally means "excessive civilities."  The word reflects a historical understanding of civility as a potentially performative and even manipulative social practice.
