neuromuscular: /ˌnʊroʊˈmʌskjələr/ | adj. | 神经肌肉的 | Relating to both nerves and muscles.  The term describes the interaction between the nervous system and the muscular system.  It often refers to the process by which nerve impulses cause muscles to contract. |

例句：

Neuromuscular diseases affect the nerves that control muscles. = 神经肌肉疾病影响控制肌肉的神经。

The patient is receiving neuromuscular blocking agents during surgery. = 病人在手术期间接受神经肌肉阻滞剂。


近义词：nervomuscular (less common)

反义词：None (No direct antonym exists, as it describes a combined system)


词源:

* **neuro-**: From Greek "neuron," meaning "nerve."
* **muscular**: From Latin "muscularis," meaning "of or pertaining to muscles."


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The neuromuscular junction transmits signals efficiently. = 神经肌肉接头有效地传递信号。
Neuromuscular disorders are often challenging to diagnose. = 神经肌肉疾病通常难以诊断。


一般过去时:
The doctor examined the patient's neuromuscular function. = 医生检查了病人的神经肌肉功能。
The study investigated the neuromuscular effects of a new drug. = 该研究调查了一种新药的神经肌肉作用。


现在完成时:
Researchers have made significant progress in understanding neuromuscular diseases. = 研究人员在理解神经肌肉疾病方面取得了重大进展。
The patient has experienced significant improvements in neuromuscular control. = 病人的神经肌肉控制能力有了显著改善。


过去完成时:
Before the surgery, the anesthesiologist had assessed the patient's neuromuscular status. = 在手术之前，麻醉师评估了病人的神经肌肉状态。
The symptoms had worsened before the patient sought medical attention. = 在病人就医之前，症状已经恶化了。


将来时:
Scientists will continue to explore the complexities of the neuromuscular system. = 科学家们将继续探索神经肌肉系统的复杂性。
New treatments will be developed to address neuromuscular disorders. = 将开发新的治疗方法来治疗神经肌肉疾病。


虚拟语气:
If the neuromuscular transmission were impaired, muscle weakness would result. = 如果神经肌肉传递受损，就会导致肌肉无力。
It is important that neuromuscular function be carefully monitored. = 仔细监测神经肌肉功能非常重要。


被动语态:
The patient's neuromuscular function was evaluated thoroughly. = 病人的神经肌肉功能得到了彻底的评估。
New drugs are being developed to improve neuromuscular function. = 正在开发新的药物以改善神经肌肉功能。


疑问句:
What causes neuromuscular disorders? = 什么导致神经肌肉疾病？
Is there a genetic component to this neuromuscular disease? = 这种神经肌肉疾病是否有遗传成分？


否定句:
The test results did not reveal any neuromuscular abnormalities. = 测试结果没有显示任何神经肌肉异常。
There is no known cure for this particular neuromuscular disease. = 目前还没有这种特殊神经肌肉疾病的已知疗法。


PHRASE->

neuromuscular junction: 神经肌肉接头
neuromuscular blockade: 神经肌肉阻滞
neuromuscular disease: 神经肌肉疾病
neuromuscular transmission: 神经肌肉传递
neuromuscular fatigue: 神经肌肉疲劳
