metaphrasis:/mɛˈtæfrəsɪs/ | n. |释义转换，意译|The process of translating a text from one language to another while maintaining the meaning but changing the form or style.  It's a type of translation that prioritizes conveying the meaning accurately over directly replicating the source text's structure.  This often involves paraphrasing and adapting the text to suit the target language and culture. | Example: Translating a proverb from English to Chinese might require metaphrasis, as a direct word-for-word translation might not convey the same meaning or cultural nuance.  The translator would need to find an equivalent proverb or phrase in Chinese that captures the essence of the original. |近义词：paraphrase, adaptation, interpretation |反义词：literal translation
