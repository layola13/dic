词源：

From Latin *inexorabilis, from *in- "not" + exorabilis "that can be entreated," from ex- "out" + orare "to speak, pray."  The word literally means "that cannot be entreated or persuaded."


用法说明：

Inexorability is used to describe something that is impossible to stop or prevent, often implying a sense of powerlessness or inevitability. It usually refers to processes or events, not individual actions.  The word carries a stronger sense of force and unstoppable momentum than simply "inevitable."
