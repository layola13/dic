refractivenesses:/ˌrɪˈfræktɪvnəsɪz/| n.| 折射率(复数) |The plural form of refractiveness, referring to multiple instances of the property of refracting light or other waves.  It describes the varying degrees or types of bending of light or other waves.|The refractivenesses of different materials were carefully measured for the experiment.  不同材料的折射率被仔细测量用于实验。 The various refractivenesses observed in the crystal suggested a complex internal structure. 在晶体中观察到的各种折射率表明其内部结构复杂。|近义词: refractive indices (单复数都可)|反义词:  None (It's not a concept that has a direct opposite; rather, it has varying degrees.)|名词
