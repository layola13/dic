词源:

The word "ineffectuality" is derived from the following:

* **in-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "without".
* **effect**:  From Old French "efet," ultimately from Latin "effectus," meaning "something accomplished, result."
* **-ual**:  A suffix forming adjectives from nouns, meaning "having the nature of" or "relating to."
* **-ity**: A suffix forming nouns from adjectives, meaning "state or quality of being."


Therefore, "ineffectuality" literally means "the state or quality of not having an effect" or "the state or quality of being ineffective."
