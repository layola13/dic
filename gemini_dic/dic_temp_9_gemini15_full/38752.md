词源:
The word "condominium" comes from the Latin word "condominium," meaning "joint dominion" or "shared sovereignty."  Originally, it referred to the shared rule of a territory by two or more powers.  Its use in real estate, referring to shared ownership of common areas while maintaining individual ownership of units, evolved later.
