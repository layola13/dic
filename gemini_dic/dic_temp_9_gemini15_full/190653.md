词源:源自法语“sauce”，意为“调味汁”，引申为“风趣，机智”，再引申为“调皮，无礼”。The word ultimately derives from the Latin "salsa," meaning "salted."  The evolution reflects a shift from the literal meaning of "seasoning" to the figurative meaning of adding spice or zest to something, eventually leading to the connotations of impudence and boldness.
