cfl:/ˌsiːˈɛfˈɛl/| n.|上下文无关文法|Context-Free Language,  a formal language whose grammar is a context-free grammar.  In computer science, CFLs are used to describe the syntax of programming languages and other formal systems. They are more powerful than regular languages but less powerful than context-sensitive languages.|例句：The parser uses a context-free grammar to analyze the input string.  解析器使用上下文无关文法来分析输入字符串。|近义词：CFG (Context-Free Grammar)|反义词：Regular Language, Context-Sensitive Language|名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations.  Therefore, typical verb tenses are not applicable.  However, we can show its use in different sentence structures.

一般现在时: (Not applicable for CFL itself, but for sentences *about* CFLs)
The grammar is a CFL. = 这个文法是一个上下文无关文法。
This language is proven to be a CFL. = 这个语言被证明是一个上下文无关文法。


一般过去时: (Not applicable for CFL itself, but for sentences *about* CFLs)
They proved the language was a CFL. = 他们证明了该语言是一个上下文无关文法。
The researcher studied CFLs in his thesis. = 这位研究员在他的论文中研究了上下文无关文法。


现在完成时: (Not applicable for CFL itself, but for sentences *about* CFLs)
We have determined that it is a CFL. = 我们已经确定它是一个上下文无关文法。
Researchers have extensively studied the properties of CFLs. = 研究人员广泛研究了上下文无关文法的特性。


过去完成时: (Not applicable for CFL itself, but for sentences *about* CFLs)
They had already classified the language as a CFL before the conference. = 在会议之前，他们已经将该语言归类为上下文无关文法。
Before the discovery, it was unknown if the language was a CFL. = 在发现之前，人们不知道该语言是否是上下文无关文法。


将来时: (Not applicable for CFL itself, but for sentences *about* CFLs)
We will analyze this grammar to see if it is a CFL. = 我们将分析这个文法以查看它是否是上下文无关文法。
The next generation of compilers will likely support more complex CFLs. = 下一代编译器可能会支持更复杂的上下文无关文法。


虚拟语气: (Not applicable for CFL itself, but for sentences *about* CFLs)
If it were a CFL, parsing would be easier. = 如果它是一个上下文无关文法，解析就会更容易。
I wish I understood CFLs better. = 我希望我更了解上下文无关文法。


被动语态:
The grammar was shown to be a CFL. = 该文法被证明是一个上下文无关文法。
The language's properties are being studied by linguists. = 语言的属性正在被语言学家研究。


疑问句:
Is this language a CFL? = 这个语言是上下文无关文法吗？
What are the limitations of CFLs? = 上下文无关文法的局限性是什么？


否定句:
This language is not a CFL. = 这个语言不是上下文无关文法。
The grammar is not a CFL; it's context-sensitive. = 该文法不是上下文无关文法；它是上下文有关的。


PHRASE->
CFL grammar = 上下文无关文法
parsing CFL = 解析上下文无关文法
properties of CFLs = 上下文无关文法的特性
types of CFLs = 上下文无关文法的类型
CFL recognition = 上下文无关文法识别
