词源:
The word "oversecularizing" is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to an excessive degree) and "secularizing" (the process of making something secular, i.e., relating to worldly things rather than religious matters).  "Secularizing" itself derives from "secular" (from Latin *saecularis,  "belonging to the age," from saeculum, "age, generation, world").
