leachability:/ˌliːtʃəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 浸出性；可浸出性；溶出性 | The ability of a substance to be dissolved and removed from a solid material by a liquid.  This is often used in the context of environmental science and engineering, referring to the potential for contaminants to be released from a solid waste or soil into groundwater or surface water. | 例句：The leachability of heavy metals from the landfill was tested.  垃圾填埋场重金属的浸出性进行了测试。

The high leachability of the pesticide is a major environmental concern.  这种杀虫剂的高浸出性是一个主要的环保问题。


近义词：solubility, extractability | 反义词：insolubility, non-leachability


词源:  Derived from the verb "leach," which ultimately comes from the Old English word "lēacian," meaning "to heal," "to cure," or "to wash."  The modern sense of "leach" (to dissolve and remove) evolved from the older meaning, referring to the process of washing out soluble substances from a material, often with water.  The suffix "-ability" denotes the capacity or potential for something.
