词源:
The word "rejuggle" is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "anew") and the verb "juggle," which originally referred to the act of tossing and catching multiple objects.  The sense of skillful manipulation and rearrangement inherent in juggling extended to the metaphorical use of "rejuggle" to describe the skillful rearranging of plans, schedules, or resources.
