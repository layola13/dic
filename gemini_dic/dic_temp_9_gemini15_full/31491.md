词源:

The word "charming" comes from the Old French word *charmer*, meaning "to charm, enchant, bewitch."  This in turn derives from the Latin word *carmen*, meaning "song, spell, incantation."  The original sense refers to the power of words or spells to enchant or captivate.  Over time, the meaning broadened to include any quality that captivates or delights.
