词源:
The word "materialise" comes from the noun "material" (meaning physical substance) and the suffix "-ise" (a common suffix used to form verbs, meaning "to become" or "to make into").  Therefore, it literally means "to become material" or "to take on material form." The word's development reflects the shift from a more philosophical concept of matter to a more concrete, visible reality.
