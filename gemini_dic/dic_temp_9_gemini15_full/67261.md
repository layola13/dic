用法说明:

This word is primarily used to describe actions or materials that involve the removal of offensive or undesirable content. It carries a connotation of deliberate censorship or purification, often applied to texts or historical accounts.  It’s less common than the verb "expurgate" itself, but carries the same core meaning in adjectival form.
