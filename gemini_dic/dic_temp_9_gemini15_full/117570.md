megahertzes:/ˈmɛɡəhɜːrts/| n. |兆赫兹|A megahertz (MHz) is a unit of frequency equal to one million hertz (cycles per second).  It's used to measure the speed of  computers,  clock speeds in microprocessors, and radio frequencies.|Example: The processor operates at a frequency of 3.5 megahertz.  这个处理器以3.5兆赫兹的频率运行。|近义词：MHz (abbreviation)|反义词：None (It's a unit of measurement, not a concept with an opposite).|名词

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The radio station broadcasts at 98 megahertz. =  这个电台在98兆赫兹广播。
This computer's processor runs at 2.4 megahertz. = 这台电脑的处理器以2.4兆赫兹运行。


一般过去时:
The old radio only worked at lower megahertzes. = 旧收音机只能在较低的兆赫兹频率下工作。
That computer's clock speed was only 1 megahertz. = 那台电脑的时钟速度只有1兆赫兹。


现在完成时:
We have upgraded our systems to handle higher megahertzes. = 我们已经升级了我们的系统以处理更高的兆赫兹频率。
The company has consistently increased its processor megahertzes over the years. = 多年来，该公司一直在不断提高其处理器的兆赫兹频率。


过去完成时:
Before the upgrade, the system operated at much lower megahertzes. = 升级之前，系统在较低的兆赫兹频率下运行。
They had already tested the device at various megahertzes before the final launch. = 他们在最终发布之前已经在各种兆赫兹频率下测试了该设备。


将来时:
Future processors will operate at much higher megahertzes. = 未来的处理器将在更高的兆赫兹频率下运行。
The new network will support even faster data transmission speeds, measured in megahertzes. = 新网络将支持更快的兆赫兹数据传输速度。


虚拟语气:
If the signal were stronger, it would reach further at these megahertzes. = 如果信号更强，它就能在这些兆赫兹频率下传播更远。
I wish my computer had a higher megahertz processor. = 我希望我的电脑有一个更高的兆赫兹处理器。


被动语态:
The frequencies are measured in megahertzes. = 频率以兆赫兹为单位测量。
The data transmission speed is often expressed in megahertzes. = 数据传输速度通常以兆赫兹表示。


疑问句:
What megahertz does this radio operate on? = 这台收音机使用什么兆赫兹频率？
At what megahertz is the signal being transmitted? = 信号以什么兆赫兹频率传输？


否定句:
The signal wasn't strong enough at those megahertzes. = 在那些兆赫兹频率下，信号不够强。
This device doesn't support megahertzes above 5. = 此设备不支持高于5兆赫兹的频率。


PHRASE->
kilohertz (kHz) to megahertz (MHz) conversion = 千赫兹到兆赫兹的转换
megahertz clock speed = 兆赫兹时钟速度
radio frequency megahertz = 无线电频率兆赫兹
processor megahertz = 处理器兆赫兹
