词源:
The word "ladyishness" is a relatively modern formation, derived from the noun "lady" and the suffix "-ishness," which indicates a quality or characteristic.  The root "lady" traces back to Old English "hlǣfdige," meaning "loaf-kneader," indicating a woman of high social standing who oversaw household affairs.  The evolution of the word reflects the changing societal perceptions of women and their roles over time.
