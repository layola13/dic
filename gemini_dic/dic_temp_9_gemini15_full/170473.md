词源:  The word "pruner" is derived from the verb "prune," which comes from the Old French word "pruine," meaning "plum."  The original meaning referred to removing the less productive branches of a fruit tree, like a plum tree, to encourage better fruit production. Over time, the meaning expanded to include trimming any type of plant.
