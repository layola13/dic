词源:
The word "reamalgamated" is formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") to "amalgamated."  "Amalgamated" itself comes from the verb "amalgamate," which originates from the Medieval Latin word "amalgamare," meaning "to mix with mercury."  The word's usage expanded to encompass the broader sense of merging or combining things generally.
