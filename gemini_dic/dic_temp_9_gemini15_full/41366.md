词源：
The word "corking" originally comes from the use of cork as a stopper for wine bottles.  Over time, the association of cork with something good (fine wine) led to the slang use of "corking" as a general term of approval, meaning "excellent" or "first-rate."  The exact etymological path is difficult to trace definitively, but the association with quality and enjoyment is clear.
