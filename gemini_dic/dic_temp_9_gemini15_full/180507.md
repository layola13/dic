regeneratory: /rɪˈdʒɛnərətɔːri/ | adj. | 再生的；具有再生能力的 |  Having the power or tendency to regenerate; relating to regeneration.  The word describes something that promotes or involves regeneration, a process of renewal, growth, or repair.


The word "regeneratory" is derived from the verb "regenerate," which itself comes from the Latin prefix "re-" (again) and the verb "generare" (to beget, to produce, to generate).  Therefore, the core meaning is "to generate again" or "to produce anew."
