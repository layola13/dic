protofibril: /ˌproʊtoʊˈfɪbrɪl/ | n. | 原纤维 | A protofibril is an early stage in the formation of amyloid fibrils, composed of aggregated proteins that are less ordered and stable than mature amyloid fibrils.  They are typically smaller and shorter than mature fibrils and are considered precursors to the formation of larger, more mature amyloid structures.  Research suggests that protofibrils may be more toxic than mature fibrils in some cases. | The researchers observed the formation of protofibrils in the early stages of the disease. 研究人员观察到该疾病早期阶段原纤维的形成。|  amyloid fibril, oligomer |  (no direct antonym, but mature fibril could be considered a contrasting term)|  名词
