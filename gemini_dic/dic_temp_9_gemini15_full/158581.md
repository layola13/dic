pleurocarp:/ˈplʊərəˌkɑːrp/| n. |侧生枝苔藓|A pleurocarpous moss is a type of moss that produces its sporophytes (spore-producing structures) laterally, along the stems, rather than at the tips. This is in contrast to acrocarpous mosses, which produce sporophytes at the tips of their stems. Pleurocarpous mosses typically have a creeping or trailing growth habit and often form extensive mats. They are characterized by their branched stems and the presence of numerous small leaves along their length.|Example:  Many species of Hypnum are pleurocarpous mosses, forming dense, lush carpets in forests.  许多羽苔属物种是侧生枝苔藓，在森林中形成茂密、繁盛的地毯。|近义词：branching moss (非精确)|反义词：acrocarpous moss|名词
