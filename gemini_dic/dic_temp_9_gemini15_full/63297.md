词源:
The word "enthusiastic" originates from the Greek word "enthousiastes," meaning "inspired by a god," or "possessed by a god."  It combines "en" (in) + "theos" (god) + "-astes" (agent suffix).  The original meaning implied a divine inspiration or fervor, which later evolved to describe passionate human feelings.
