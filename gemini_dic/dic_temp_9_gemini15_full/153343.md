peneplain:/ˈpɛnɪpleɪn/| n. |准平原|A peneplain is a relatively flat, gently undulating plain formed by the erosion of a landmass over a very long period of time.  It is characterized by low relief and a relatively thin covering of unconsolidated sediment.  The term implies that the area has been reduced almost to base level (sea level) by erosion. |The Appalachian Mountains are a classic example of a dissected peneplain, showing the remnants of a once-level surface.  |近义词：plain, plateau (in some contexts)|反义词：mountain range, highland

一般过去时:
Geologists studied the ancient peneplain for clues to past climates. = 地质学家研究古代准平原以寻找过去气候的线索。
The river carved the peneplain into a series of valleys. = 河流将准平原雕刻成一系列山谷。

现在完成时:
Erosion has shaped this landscape into a peneplain. = 侵蚀已将此景观塑造成了准平原。

过去完成时:
Before the uplift, the area was a vast peneplain. = 在抬升之前，该地区是一个广阔的准平原。
The geologists had already identified the area as a possible peneplain before beginning their fieldwork. = 地质学家在开始野外工作之前就已经确定该地区可能是准平原。

将来时:
Future erosion will further reduce the height of this peneplain. = 未来的侵蚀将进一步降低这个准平原的高度。

被动语态:
The peneplain was formed by millions of years of erosion. = 准平原是由数百万年的侵蚀形成的。
The age of the peneplain is being debated by geologists. = 地质学家正在争论准平原的年龄。

疑问句:
Is this landscape a peneplain? = 这片景观是准平原吗？
What processes formed this extensive peneplain? = 什么过程形成了这个广阔的准平原？

否定句:
This area is not a peneplain; it's a plateau. = 这个地区不是准平原；它是高原。
