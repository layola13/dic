词源:
Deserted comes from the verb "desert," meaning to abandon or leave.  The suffix "-ed" transforms the verb into an adjective, signifying a state of being abandoned.  "Desert" itself has roots in the Old French word "deserter," ultimately deriving from the Latin "desertus," the past participle of "deserere," meaning "to abandon" or "to forsake."
