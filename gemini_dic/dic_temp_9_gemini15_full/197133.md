The word "shanga" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?

2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name (of a person, place, or thing), a brand name, or a term specific to a particular field or dialect.  If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it might help identify its meaning.

3. **It's a word from another language:**  It could be a word borrowed from another language.  Specifying the language would allow for a more accurate analysis.

Please provide more information so I can assist you better.
