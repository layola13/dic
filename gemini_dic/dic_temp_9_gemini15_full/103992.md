词源:
The word "juggling" comes from the Middle English word "jugelen," which in turn derives from the Old French word "jogler."  The ultimate origin is uncertain, but some etymologists suggest a connection to the Old High German word "jogelære," meaning "trickery" or "jugglery," indicating the historical association of juggling with skill and deception in performance.
