The word "reevidence" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized field.

To help, I can offer possibilities if you can provide context:  Was it encountered in a specific book, article, or conversation? Knowing the context might reveal the intended word or a possible intended meaning.  For example, it might be a blend of "re-" and "evidence," suggesting a re-examination or reconsideration of evidence.
