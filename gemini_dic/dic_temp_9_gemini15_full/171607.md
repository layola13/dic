pulmonibranchiata: /ˌpʌlmənoʊˈbræŋkiˌeɪtə/ | adj. | 肺鳃类的；具有肺和鳃的 |  Referring to aquatic animals possessing both lungs and gills for respiration. This term is primarily used in zoology to classify certain amphibians and their larval stages. The term highlights the dual respiratory system, suggesting an adaptation to both aquatic and terrestrial environments. | Example:  Some larval amphibians exhibit pulmonibranchiata characteristics. 一些两栖动物的幼体表现出肺鳃类的特征。 | 近义词:  (No exact synonyms, but descriptive phrases like "having both lungs and gills" could be used.) | 反义词:  (No direct antonyms, but terms describing organisms with only lungs or only gills could be considered opposites, e.g., "pulmonate," "branchial") |

PHRASE->
(There are no common idiomatic phrases using "pulmonibranchiata" due to its specialized scientific nature.)

Word Origin:  The word is a combination of "pulmo" (lung), "branchia" (gill), and the suffix "-ata" (plural, indicating a group or class).  It's a scientific term constructed from classical Greek and Latin roots.
