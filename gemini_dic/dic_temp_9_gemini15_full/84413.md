词源:
The adverb "hallowedly" derives from the adjective "hallowed," which comes from the Old English "hāligod," meaning "holy, consecrated."  The "-ed" suffix in "hallowed" is a past participle form, implying a state of being made holy or sacred.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner or way in which something is done.  Therefore, "hallowedly" signifies an action performed in a holy or sacred manner.
