planck:/plæŋk/| n. |普朗克；普朗克常数|The Planck constant is a fundamental physical constant that is approximately equal to 6.626 x 10^-34 joule-seconds.  It is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, relating the energy of a photon to its frequency.|例句：The energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency, as described by Planck's constant. 光子的能量与其频率成正比，这由普朗克常数描述。|近义词：quantum constant (部分近义)|反义词:|None|名词
