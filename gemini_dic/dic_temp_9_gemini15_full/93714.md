The word "immaculatenesses" is derived from the adjective "immaculate," which comes from the Latin word "immaculatus," a combination of the prefix "in-" (not) and "maculatus" (spotted or stained).  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun denoting the state or quality of being immaculate, and the addition of "-es" indicates the plural form, representing multiple instances of immaculateness.
