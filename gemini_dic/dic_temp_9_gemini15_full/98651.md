词源:
The word "insufferably" derives from the word "suffer," meaning to experience pain or hardship.  The prefix "in-" indicates negation, making "insufferable" mean "unable to be suffered" or "intolerable."  The suffix "-ably" turns the adjective "insufferable" into an adverb, modifying verbs and adjectives to describe the manner or degree to which something is unbearable.  The word's roots trace back to Old French and ultimately to Latin.
