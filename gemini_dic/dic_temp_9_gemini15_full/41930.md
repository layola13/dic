It encompasses various theories and models attempting to explain the universe's beginnings, its composition, and its ultimate fate.  Different cosmologies may propose different mechanisms for the universe's creation and development. | 例句：Modern cosmologies rely heavily on observations from telescopes and space probes. 现代宇宙论很大程度上依赖于望远镜和太空探测器的观测。| 例句：Ancient cosmologies often involved mythological explanations of the universe's creation. 古代宇宙论常常包含对宇宙起源的神话解释。| 近义词：cosmogony, worldviews | 反义词：无
