diamagnetically:/ˌdaɪæˌmæɡˈnɛtɪkli/| adv.| 反磁性地，抗磁性地 |  Describes a substance's behavior in a magnetic field where it is repelled rather than attracted.  It indicates a material's property of having a weak, negative magnetic susceptibility. | Example:  The material behaved diamagnetically in the presence of a strong magnetic field.  该材料在强磁场存在下表现出抗磁性。|近义词: repulsively (in a magnetic context) |反义词: paramagnetically, ferromagnetically|副词


USAGE->
This word is an adverb and doesn't have tenses like verbs.  It describes how something *behaves* magnetically.  Therefore, tense conjugations are not applicable.  The usage remains consistent across different sentence structures.

Example 1 (Simple Sentence): The sample was tested and reacted diamagnetically. 样品经过测试，反应为抗磁性。

Example 2 (Complex Sentence): Because of its unique atomic structure, the substance behaved diamagnetically when exposed to the magnetic field. 由于其独特的原子结构，这种物质在暴露于磁场时表现出抗磁性。
