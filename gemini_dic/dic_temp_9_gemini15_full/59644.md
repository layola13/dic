The word "eche" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis following the requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  Perhaps provide more context where you encountered this word.
* **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word from a different language, possibly with a similar-sounding pronunciation to an English word.  If you can specify the language, I might be able to help.
* **It's a proper noun or neologism:**  It could be a newly coined word, a name, or a word specific to a niche field.
