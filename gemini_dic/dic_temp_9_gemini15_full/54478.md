词源：

The word comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the word "interested," which itself derives from the verb "interest," meaning to engage or occupy the attention of.  The original meaning was indeed "lack of interest," but the meaning shifted over time to emphasize the lack of *self-interested* motivation, leading to the current primary meaning of impartiality.
