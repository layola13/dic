词源：

The word "nonamenable" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "amenable."  "Amenable" itself comes from the Old French word "amenable," which ultimately derives from the Latin "ad" (to) + "men" (mind, hand, or will).  Thus, "amenable" originally meant "easily led or managed," reflecting the idea of being easily influenced or controlled.  "Nonamenable" therefore directly counters this original meaning.
