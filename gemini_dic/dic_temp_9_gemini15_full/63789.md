epicycloid:/ˈɛpɪˌsaɪklɔɪd/ | n. |外摆线|A curve traced by a point on the circumference of a circle that rolls around the outside of another circle.  It's a type of roulette curve.  The shape depends on the relative sizes of the two circles.| Example: The gear teeth often have the shape of an epicycloid to ensure smooth meshing.  齿轮齿通常呈外摆线形状，以确保平稳啮合。|近义词：roulette curve|反义词：hypocycloid
