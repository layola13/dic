词源:

* **concentrate:**  This verb comes from the Latin word "concentrāre," meaning "to bring together to one center."  The prefix "con-" means "together," and the root "-centrāre" is related to the Latin word "centrum," meaning "center."

* **on:** This preposition is of Old English origin, related to the word "an," meaning "in," "on," or "at."


The phrasal verb "concentrate on" thus literally means "to bring one's focus together to one central point."
