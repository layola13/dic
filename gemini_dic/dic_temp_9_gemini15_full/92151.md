hypersensuous: /ˌhaɪpərˈsɛnʃuəs/ | adj. | 超感觉的；感觉过度的 | Extremely sensitive to sensory experiences; characterized by excessive or heightened sensory perception.  The word suggests an intensity or acuity of the senses beyond the normal range.


英文解析：Hypersensuous describes a state or condition where sensory experiences are amplified or intensified.  It might involve heightened awareness of sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touch, often to a degree that can be overwhelming or even painful.  It's not simply heightened sensitivity, but rather a heightened, almost excessive, engagement with the sensory world.
