reichsstand: /ˈraɪksʃtɑːnt/ | n. | 国家协会；帝国机构 |  A Reichsstand was an organization representing a particular sector of the German economy or profession during the Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany.  These organizations were involved in regulating their respective sectors and often collaborated with the government.  The plural is Reichsstände. | The Reichsstand der Deutschen Industrie (RDI) was a powerful organization representing German industry. = 德国工业国家协会(RDI)是一个代表德国工业的强大组织。


The term is a compound word combining *Reich* (empire, realm) and *Stand* (estate, class, organization).  *Reich* derives from Old High German *rîhhi* (kingdom, realm), ultimately from Proto-Germanic *rīki-.  *Stand* comes from Old High German *stant*, related to English "stand," referring to a social class or group.  Therefore, the word literally translates to "empire estate" or "national association."

During the Weimar Republic and the Nazi era, the Reichsstände were integral to the German economic system, acting as intermediaries between the government and various professional and economic groups. Their influence varied depending on the political climate and the particular Reichsstand.  Their role was largely to regulate and oversee their respective sectors, often working in close cooperation with the government's economic policies.  However, under the Nazi regime, their autonomy diminished significantly as the regime consolidated power and centralized control over the economy.
