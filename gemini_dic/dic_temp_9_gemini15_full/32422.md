chilostomatous:/ˌkaɪləˈstoʊmətəs/ | adj. | 具唇口的；有唇状口的 |  Having a lip-like mouth or opening.  This term is primarily used in zoology, particularly when describing certain invertebrates, especially bryozoans.  It refers to the structure of their mouth, which has a distinct lip-like appearance. | Example:  "The chilostomatous bryozoan displayed a characteristic horseshoe-shaped lophophore." = “这种具唇口的苔藓虫展示了其特征性的马蹄形腕冠。” | 近义词： labiate (in a broader sense) | 反义词：  None readily available; the antonym would describe a mouth structure lacking the lip-like feature, but no single established term exists.
