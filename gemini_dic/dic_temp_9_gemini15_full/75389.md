词源:

The word "frowzy" likely originates from the Middle English word "frow," meaning "woman," and the suffix "-sy," indicating a quality or condition.  Over time, its meaning shifted from simply referring to a woman's appearance to implying a general state of untidiness and staleness, possibly associated with a lack of cleanliness.  The association with musty smells and dampness may have developed later.
