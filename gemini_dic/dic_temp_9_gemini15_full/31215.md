词源:

The word "channeled" comes from the noun "channel," ultimately deriving from the Old French "canel," meaning "a groove or gutter."  This in turn is related to the Latin "canna," meaning "reed" or "cane."  The meaning extended to include artificial waterways and, metaphorically, pathways for anything flowing, including emotions or ideas.  The "-ed" suffix indicates the past participle or adjective form of the verb.
