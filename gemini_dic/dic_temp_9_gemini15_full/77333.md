Etymology:

The word "gauche" comes from the French word meaning "left" or "left-handed". In French, "left" has historically been associated with things that are considered unlucky, awkward, or clumsy.  This association likely led to the word's adoption into English to describe someone lacking social grace or refinement.  The shift in meaning from "left" to "awkward" likely occurred through a metaphorical association.  Just as the left hand was often considered less skilled or less favored, so too were those lacking in social dexterity considered "gauche".
