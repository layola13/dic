crystalloid:/ˈkrɪstəlɔɪd/| n. |晶体状物质；晶体溶液|A crystalloid is a substance that, in solution, diffuses through a semipermeable membrane.  Crystalloids are typically composed of small molecules that can easily pass through cell membranes.  They are used in medicine as intravenous fluids to replenish fluids and electrolytes lost due to dehydration, blood loss, or other conditions.|例句：The doctor prescribed a crystalloid solution to rehydrate the patient.医生开了晶体溶液来给病人补水。|例句：Crystalloids are often preferred over colloids in the initial treatment of hypovolemic shock.在治疗低血容量休克的初期，晶体溶液通常比胶体溶液更受欢迎。|近义词：electrolyte solution, intravenous fluid|反义词：colloid
