The word "noninfinitely" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism (a newly coined word) or a misspelling.  It's likely an attempt to create a word meaning "not infinitely" or "finitely".

Therefore, a full analysis following your requested format is not possible.  To provide helpful information, let's analyze the intended meaning, "not infinitely," and the word "finitely," which conveys the same meaning.

**finitely:**

/ˈfaɪnaɪtli/ | adv. | 有限地，确定地 |  The adjective "finite" means having limits or bounds.  The adverb "finitely" indicates something is limited in extent, quantity, or size. It can also mean "definitely" or "certainly" in some contexts.

**英文解析:**  Indicates a limit or boundary; not unlimited or endless. In some contexts, it means definitively or certainly.


**例句:**

The resources are finitely distributed among the teams. = 资源在各团队之间有限地分配。

I can finitely say that I saw him there. = 我可以肯定地说我看到他在了那里。


**近义词:**

**反义词:**

infinitely, endlessly, limitlessly


**词性:**

adverb


**USAGE->**  (Since finitely is an adverb, its usage is straightforward and doesn't require a breakdown by tense like a verb.)


**PHRASE->**  There are no common phrases specifically using "finitely." However, phrases like "to a finite extent," "finitely many," or "finitely supported" are used in mathematical and technical contexts.
