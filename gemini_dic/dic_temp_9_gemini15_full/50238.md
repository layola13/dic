词源:

The word "dependant" ultimately derives from the Old French word "dependent," which itself comes from the Latin word "dependens," the present participle of "pendere," meaning "to hang," "to weigh," or "to be suspended."  The sense of relying or being contingent on something else developed from the image of something hanging or suspended from something else.
