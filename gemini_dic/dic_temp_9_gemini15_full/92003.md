英文解析:  The word "hyperobtrusivenesses" is the plural form of "hyperobtrusiveness,"  which itself is a relatively uncommon word formed by combining "hyper" (meaning excessive or beyond normal limits), "obtrusive" (meaning noticeable or prominent in an unwelcome or intrusive way), and the suffix "-ness" (indicating a state or quality). Therefore, "hyperobtrusivenesses" refers to multiple instances or types of excessive, unwelcome, or intrusive prominence or behavior.  It suggests a series of actions or qualities that are overly noticeable and potentially irritating or offensive.
