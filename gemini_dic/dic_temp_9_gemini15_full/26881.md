词源:
The term "cakewalk" originally referred to a type of social dance popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly among African Americans in the Southern United States.  The dance involved couples performing a graceful, often showy, promenade.  Because the dance appeared relatively easy to perform, the term "cakewalk" came to be used figuratively to describe anything easily accomplished.  The transition from the dance to the figurative meaning is a testament to the perceived ease of the dance itself.
