词源:
The word "sapped" comes from the Old English word "sappian," meaning "to dig," "to undermine," or "to weaken."  This is related to the word "sap," which originally referred to the juice of a plant, and the idea that drawing the sap weakens the plant.  The meaning then broadened to encompass the weakening of anything, including people and resources.
