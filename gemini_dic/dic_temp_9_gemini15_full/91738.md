词源:

The word "hyperdeveloped" is a compound word.  "Hyper-" is a prefix derived from the Greek word "ὑπέρ" (hupér), meaning "over," "above," "beyond," or "excessive."  "Developed" comes from the verb "develop," ultimately deriving from Old French "developper" (to unfold, unroll), which in turn comes from the Latin "dis-" (apart) and "volvere" (to roll).  Therefore, "hyperdeveloped" literally means "excessively developed" or "developed beyond the normal extent".
