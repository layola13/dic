英文解析：Deixis refers to words or phrases (deictic expressions) whose meaning depends on the context of their utterance, specifically the speaker, the time of utterance, and the location of utterance.  These expressions point to aspects of the context of utterance rather than having a fixed meaning.  Deictic expressions are crucial for understanding language in context.


例句：

"I am here now." = 我现在在这里。

"Come here." = 到这里来。


"That was a great day." = 那是一个伟大的日子。

"Yesterday, I saw a movie." = 昨天，我看了一部电影。


词源:  From Greek *deixis*, "pointing," from *deiknunai*, "to show," "to point out."  The term reflects the pointing or indicating nature of deictic expressions.
