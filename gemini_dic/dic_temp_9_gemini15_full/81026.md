词源:

The word "graduated" comes from the Latin word "gradus," meaning "step" or "degree."  The sense of "having completed a course of study" developed from the idea of progressing through a series of steps or levels in education.  The use as an adjective describing things marked with gradations (like a graduated cylinder) is a direct extension of this root meaning.
