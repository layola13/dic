The word "meditance" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  It may be a misspelling, a newly coined word, or a word from a specialized field not widely known.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer some assistance.
