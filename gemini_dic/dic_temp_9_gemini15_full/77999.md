词源:

The word "gentlemanhood" is derived from "gentleman" + "-hood."  "Gentleman" itself has a complex etymology.  The "gentle" part comes from Old French *gentil, meaning "noble," related to Latin *gens, *gentis ("clan, race, family"). The "-man" suffix is the Old English word *mann, meaning "man." Thus, "gentleman" originally referred to a man of noble birth. Over time, the meaning evolved to describe a man of refined manners and high moral character, regardless of his lineage.  "-hood" is a suffix forming nouns denoting state, condition, or quality.
