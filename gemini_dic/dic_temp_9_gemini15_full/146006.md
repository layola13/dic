词源:
The word "overdosed" is formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "dose," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "dose," meaning "a portion" or "a quantity."  The sense of "dose" relating to medicine became established in English during the 16th century.  Therefore, "overdosed" literally means "given or taken an excessive dose."
