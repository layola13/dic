词源:

The word "exertive" is derived from the verb "exert," which comes from the Old French word "exert," meaning "to exert oneself,"  itself from the Latin "exertus," the past participle of "exertus," meaning "put forth, stretched out".  The suffix "-ive" is added to create the adjective form, signifying a quality or tendency.
