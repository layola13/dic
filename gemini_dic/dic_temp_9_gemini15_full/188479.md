词源:  The word "rueful" comes from the Middle English word "rueful," which itself derives from the Old French word "rueful" meaning "pitiful, lamentable."  Ultimately, it is connected to the Old French verb "reuer," meaning "to regret, to be sorry," which is related to the modern English word "rue" (to feel regret or sorrow).
