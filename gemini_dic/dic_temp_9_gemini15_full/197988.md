词源:The word "shoal" originates from Old English *scōl, meaning "crowd, multitude."  This sense of a large group of people or things evolved into its modern usage to describe a large group of fish swimming together and also a shallow area of water, possibly due to the visual similarity of a large group of fish to a shallow area visible from above.
