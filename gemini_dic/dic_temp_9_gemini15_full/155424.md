The word "pheese" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical analysis as requested.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it might be possible to guess the intended word.
* **It's a neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or term used within a specific community or context.  Again, context is crucial.
* **It's a proper noun:**  Perhaps it's a name or place.
* **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into English.
