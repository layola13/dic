词源:
From the verb "negotiate," ultimately from Latin *negotiāri "to carry on business," from *negōti- "business," from *negōtium "business," from *nec "not" + *ōtium "leisure."  The sense development is from "to be busy" to "to transact business," and finally to "to bargain or discuss terms."  The "-able" suffix indicates something capable of being negotiated.
