cocatalyst:/ˌkoʊˈkætəlɪst/| n. |助催化剂|A substance that enhances the activity of a catalyst.  It does not itself catalyze the reaction but increases the rate or efficiency of the catalyst.  A cocatalyst often participates in the catalytic cycle but is regenerated at the end.|Example: In this photocatalytic water splitting reaction, platinum nanoparticles act as a cocatalyst, improving the efficiency of the semiconductor photocatalyst.|近义词：promoter, activator|反义词：inhibitor


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The cocatalyst enhances the reaction rate. = 助催化剂提高了反应速率。
This substance acts as a cocatalyst in the process. =这种物质在这个过程中充当助催化剂。


一般过去时:
The cocatalyst improved the yield of the reaction. = 助催化剂提高了反应的产率。
Scientists discovered a new cocatalyst for this reaction. = 科学家们发现了一种这种反应的新型助催化剂。


现在完成时:
Researchers have developed several effective cocatalysts. = 研究人员已经开发了几种有效的助催化剂。
The industry has adopted this cocatalyst for its efficiency. = 该行业因其效率而采用了这种助催化剂。


过去完成时:
They had already added the cocatalyst before the reaction started. = 他们在反应开始之前就已经添加了助催化剂。
The experiment had failed because the cocatalyst was impure. = 实验失败了，因为助催化剂不纯。


将来时:
We will use a different cocatalyst in the next experiment. = 我们将在下一个实验中使用不同的助催化剂。
Scientists predict that this cocatalyst will revolutionize the industry. = 科学家预测这种助催化剂将彻底改变该行业。


虚拟语气:
If we had used a more effective cocatalyst, the results would have been better. = 如果我们使用了更有效的助催化剂，结果会更好。
I wish we had known about this cocatalyst earlier. = 我真希望我们早点知道这种助催化剂。


被动语态:
The reaction was significantly improved by the cocatalyst. = 反应因助催化剂而得到了显著改善。
A new cocatalyst is being developed for industrial applications. = 正在开发一种用于工业应用的新型助催化剂。


疑问句:
What type of cocatalyst is used in this reaction? = 此反应中使用了哪种类型的助催化剂？
Which cocatalyst is the most efficient for this process? = 对于这个过程，哪种助催化剂效率最高？


否定句:
The reaction did not proceed efficiently without the cocatalyst. = 没有助催化剂，反应进行得不高效。
They did not add the necessary cocatalyst to the mixture. = 他们没有向混合物中添加必要的助催化剂。


PHRASE->
