词源:
The word "scaremongering" is a compound word.  "Scare" comes from Old Norse "skera" meaning to cut or shear, later developing the sense of frightening. "Mongering" comes from Old English "mangian," meaning "to mix, trade, or deal in." Therefore, "scaremongering" literally means "dealing in scares" or "trading in fear."  The "-ing" suffix makes it a gerund, functioning as a noun.
