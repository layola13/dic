词源:
The word "cannibalize" ultimately derives from "cannibal," which comes from the Spanish word "caníbal," itself derived from the Carib people of the Caribbean.  The Carib were known for their practice of cannibalism, hence the association.  The verb "cannibalize" evolved from the noun to describe the act of taking parts from something else, akin to consuming it for one's own benefit.
