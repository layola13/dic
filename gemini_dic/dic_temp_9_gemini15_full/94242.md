词源:

The word "imperiously" derives from the adjective "imperious," which comes from the Latin word "imperiosus."  "Imperiosus" is formed from "imperium," meaning "command," "power," or "authority."  The suffix "-osus" indicates full of or characterized by. Therefore, "imperiosus" literally means "full of command" or "characterized by power."  The word evolved through Old French "imperieux" before entering English.
