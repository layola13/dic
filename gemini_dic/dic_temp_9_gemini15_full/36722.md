用法说明:

The word "collocational" is primarily used in linguistics and corpus linguistics to describe the tendency of certain words to appear together more frequently than would be expected by chance. It reflects the natural patterns and conventions of language use.  Understanding collocations is crucial for fluent and natural-sounding language production, as well as for accurate language analysis.  For example, while "strong tea" is a common collocation, "powerful tea" is less common and may sound unnatural.

This adjective is not frequently used in everyday conversation but is more common in academic discussions of language and vocabulary.
