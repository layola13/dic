The word "nosesmart" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word, or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown cannot be provided.  To offer analysis, we would need to know the intended meaning and context in which it was used.  If you can provide more information, I can attempt a more specific response.
