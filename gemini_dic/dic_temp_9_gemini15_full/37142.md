词源:  The idiom's origin is unclear, but it likely stems from the process of laundering clothes.  Stains or dirt that seem impossible to remove might eventually disappear during the washing process.  This visual metaphor extended to signify that problems, like stains, might unexpectedly clear up over time.  The phrase's use became more common in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
