词源:

The word "overpampered" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the adjective "pampered," which comes from the verb "pamper," ultimately deriving from the Old French word "pamprer" (to feed daintily, to indulge).  The meaning evolved to encompass excessive indulgence and spoiling.
