词源:

* **pseudo-**:  From Greek *pseudes* meaning "false" or "lying."  This prefix indicates something that is false or counterfeit.

* **impartial**: From Latin *im* (not) + *partis* (part).  Meaning "not taking sides," "neutral," or "objective."  

* **-ly**:  An adverbial suffix indicating manner or quality.


Therefore, "pseudoimpartially" combines the idea of something appearing impartial (fair and unbiased) while actually being the opposite – biased or unfair in a deceptive manner.
