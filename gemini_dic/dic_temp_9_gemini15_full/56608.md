词源: The word "doncella" is derived from the Old Spanish word "donzella," which itself comes from the Vulgar Latin "domicella," a diminutive of "domina," meaning "lady" or "mistress."  The suffix "-ella" indicates a diminutive or affectionate form.  This ultimately traces back to the Latin word "domus," meaning "house," reflecting the idea of a woman of noble or respectable family.
