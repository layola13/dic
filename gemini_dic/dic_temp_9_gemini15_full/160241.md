PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "pontificate".  The word itself is the primary focus.

词源:
From Latin *pontifex* ("pontiff"), literally "bridge-maker," from *pons* ("bridge") + *facere* ("to make").  The Pope, as the highest authority in the Catholic Church, was considered a "bridge-maker" between God and humanity, leading to the association of the word with authoritative pronouncements.
