WORD ORIGIN->

The word "overfiltering" is a compound word. It's formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the noun "filtering" (the process of removing unwanted elements).  "Filtering" itself is derived from the verb "to filter," which comes from the Old French word "filtrer," ultimately tracing back to the Latin word "filtrare," meaning "to strain" or "to filter."
