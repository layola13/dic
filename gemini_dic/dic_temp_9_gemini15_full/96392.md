词源：  The word comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), "dis-" (meaning "apart" or "not"), "criminating" (from the verb "criminate," meaning "to accuse" or "distinguish").  Originally, it meant "not distinguishing between right and wrong," but its meaning has broadened to encompass a lack of distinction in general.
