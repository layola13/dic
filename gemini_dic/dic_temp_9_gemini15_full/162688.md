preauditory:/ˌpriːˈɔːdɪtəri/| adj.| 预听觉的；听觉前的 | Relating to the processes that occur before auditory perception, often involving the analysis and processing of sound signals before they reach the conscious level of hearing.  | Example: Preauditory processing plays a crucial role in filtering out irrelevant sounds and focusing attention on important auditory information. 预听觉处理在过滤无关声音和将注意力集中在重要的听觉信息方面起着至关重要的作用。|近义词：pre-perceptual, pre-sensory|反义词：postauditory
