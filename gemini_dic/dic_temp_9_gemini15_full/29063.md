The word "carus" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or related word?

2. **It's a rare or obsolete word:** If the spelling is correct, it might be a very uncommon word, a word from a specific dialect, or a word that is no longer used.  More context is needed.

3. **It's from another language:** It may be a word from a different language.  If you can provide the language of origin, I might be able to help.

Please provide more information or context so I can assist you properly.
