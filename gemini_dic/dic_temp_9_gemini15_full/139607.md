词源:  The word "occasionalistic" derives from "occasionalism," which itself comes from the Latin "occasio" (occasion, opportunity) and the suffix "-ism" (denoting a doctrine or system of belief).  The term reflects the central idea of occasionalism, that God intervenes at opportune moments to effect changes in the world.
