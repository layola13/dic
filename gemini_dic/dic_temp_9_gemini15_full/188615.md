词源:
The word "rumbustiously" derives from "rumbustious," which itself is of uncertain origin.  Some etymologists suggest a connection to the obsolete word "rumbus" meaning "noisy revelry," possibly from a combination of roots implying a loud, boisterous sound. The suffix "-ously" adds an adverbial sense.
