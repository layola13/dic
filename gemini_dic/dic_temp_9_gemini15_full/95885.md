词源:
The word "increasingly" is derived from the adjective "increasing," which in turn comes from the verb "increase."  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating manner or degree.  The root "increase" ultimately traces back to Old French "encreistre" and Latin "in-" (in, on) + "crescere" (to grow).
