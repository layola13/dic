geosynclinal:/ˌdʒioʊˈsɪŋklɪnəl/| n. |地槽 |A geosyncline is a large downfold in the Earth's crust, often filled with thick sequences of sedimentary and volcanic rocks.  These are typically found along the margins of continents and are associated with mountain building. |Example: The Appalachian Mountains were formed from the sediments deposited in a large geosyncline.  阿巴拉契亚山脉是由沉积在一个大型地槽中的沉积物形成的。|近义词：synclinorium |反义词：geanticline


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The geosyncline slowly accumulates sediments. = 地槽缓慢地积累沉积物。
This area was once a deep geosyncline. = 这个地区曾经是一个深海地槽。

一般过去时:
The geosyncline filled with sediments over millions of years. = 地槽经过数百万年被沉积物填满。
Geologists studied the ancient geosyncline. = 地质学家研究了古代的地槽。

现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered many fossils in the geosyncline. = 科学家在地槽中发现了许多化石。
The study of geosynclines has advanced significantly. = 对地槽的研究已经取得了显著进展。

过去完成时:
Before the mountain building, a large geosyncline had existed there. = 在造山运动之前，那里存在着一个大型地槽。
The tectonic plates had already begun to converge before the geosyncline fully formed. = 在地槽完全形成之前，构造板块就已经开始汇聚了。

将来时:
Future research will further clarify the formation of geosynclines. = 未来的研究将进一步阐明地槽的形成。
Geologists will continue to study the processes within geosynclines. = 地质学家将继续研究地槽内部的过程。


虚拟语气:
If the geosyncline were still active, we would see more volcanic activity. = 如果地槽仍然活跃，我们将看到更多的火山活动。
I wish I had more time to study the details of this particular geosyncline. = 我希望我有更多的时间来研究这个特定地槽的细节。

被动语态:
The geosyncline was filled with sediments. = 地槽被沉积物填满。
The age of the rocks in the geosyncline is being determined. = 地槽中岩石的年龄正在被确定。

疑问句:
What kind of rocks are found in this geosyncline? = 这个地槽中发现了什么类型的岩石？
Where are the most significant geosynclines located? = 最重要的地槽位于何处？

否定句:
This formation is not a geosyncline; it's a different geological structure. = 这个地层不是地槽；它是一种不同的地质构造。
The sediments did not accumulate evenly across the entire geosyncline. = 沉积物并非均匀地沉积在地槽的整个区域。
