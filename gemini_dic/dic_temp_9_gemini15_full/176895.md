The word "reak" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word, such as "wreak" (to inflict), "reek" (to smell strongly), or another word entirely.  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **It's a dialect word or slang:**  It might be a word used in a specific region or community, but not widely recognized.  If this is the case, providing more context (where you encountered the word) would be helpful.

3. **It's a newly coined word:**  It's possible it's a very recent invention, not yet included in dictionaries.

To help me provide the analysis you need, please clarify the word you intended to ask about.
