nonmutants:/ˌnɒnˈmjuːtənts/ | n. | 非突变体，未突变体 | Individuals or organisms that have not undergone a mutation.  They possess the original, unaltered genetic makeup. | Example: The experiment compared the growth rates of mutants and nonmutants.  实验比较了突变体和非突变体的生长速度。|近义词：wild-type (in genetics), normal variants |反义词：mutants


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The scientist studies nonmutants in the lab. = 科学家在实验室里研究非突变体。
Nonmutants show a normal phenotype. = 非突变体表现出正常的表型。


一般过去时:
Researchers observed nonmutants for several generations. = 研究人员观察了几代非突变体。
The control group consisted entirely of nonmutants. = 对照组完全由非突变体组成。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several key differences between mutants and nonmutants. = 科学家已经确定了突变体和非突变体之间几个关键的区别。
We have sequenced the genomes of numerous nonmutants. = 我们已经对许多非突变体的基因组进行了测序。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had prepared a large sample of nonmutants. = 实验之前，他们已经准备了一个大量的非突变体样本。
The researchers had already observed the behavior of nonmutants in previous studies. = 研究人员在之前的研究中已经观察过非突变体的行为。


将来时:
We will compare the results from mutants and nonmutants. = 我们将比较突变体和非突变体的结果。
They will analyze the genetic makeup of the nonmutants. = 他们将分析非突变体的基因构成。


虚拟语气:
If we had more nonmutants, the results would be more reliable. = 如果我们有更多的非突变体，结果将更可靠。
I wish we had access to a larger population of nonmutants. = 我希望我们能够获得更大的非突变体群体。


被动语态:
Nonmutants were used as a control group in the study. = 在这项研究中，非突变体被用作对照组。
The phenotypes of nonmutants are being carefully monitored. = 非突变体的表型正在被仔细监测。


疑问句:
Are these specimens nonmutants? = 这些标本是非突变体吗？
How many nonmutants were included in the analysis? = 分析中包含多少非突变体？


否定句:
The sample was not composed entirely of nonmutants. = 样本并非完全由非突变体组成。
There were few nonmutants remaining after the selection process. = 选择过程之后，剩下的非突变体很少。


PHRASE->
nonmutant strain = 非突变菌株
nonmutant allele = 非突变等位基因
nonmutant phenotype = 非突变表型
population of nonmutants = 非突变体种群
control nonmutants = 对照非突变体
