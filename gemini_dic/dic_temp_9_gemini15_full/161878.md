praenominical: /ˌpriːˈnɒmɪnɪkəl/ | adj. | 前名的；指名的 | Relating to or denoting a praenomen (the first name in Roman nomenclature).  The term is primarily used in historical and linguistic contexts related to Roman naming conventions.  It describes something pertaining to the *praenomen*, the personal name that came before the *nomen* (family name) and *cognomen* (additional name).


例句：

The praenominical element of Gaius Julius Caesar is "Gaius." = 盖乌斯·尤利乌斯·凯撒的名字中，“盖乌斯”是前名部分。

The inscription included only the praenominical and nominal elements, omitting the cognomen. = 铭文只包含了前名和氏族名部分，省略了第三名。


近义词：forename, first name (in a less formal or historical context)


反义词：There is no direct antonym, as "praenominical" describes a specific element within a naming system.  A contrasting term could be "nominal" (referring to the family name) or "cognominal" (referring to the additional name).


词性：形容词
