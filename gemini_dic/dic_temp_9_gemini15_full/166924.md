词源:

The word "prestigiousness" is derived from the adjective "prestigious," which in turn comes from the French word "prestige," ultimately from the Latin word "praestigium," meaning "illusion, trick, jugglery."  The sense of "high reputation or influence" evolved from the original meaning of magical illusion, suggesting an aura of wonder and admiration surrounding something prestigious.  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, indicating the quality or state of being prestigious.
