词源:
The word "discount" comes from the Old French word "descont," meaning "count off" or "deduct."  It entered English in the 15th century. The prefix "dis-" means "away" or "off," and "-count" relates to counting or calculation.  Therefore, the original meaning implied subtracting or deducting an amount.
