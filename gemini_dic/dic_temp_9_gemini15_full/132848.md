词源:

The word "noneffectiveness" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "effectiveness".  "Effectiveness" derives from the adjective "effective," ultimately from the Old French "effectif" (meaning "actual, real")  and Latin "effectus" (past participle of "efficere," meaning "to bring about, accomplish").  Therefore, "noneffectiveness" literally means "not bringing about a desired result."
