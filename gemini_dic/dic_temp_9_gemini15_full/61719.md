词源:  The word "emotionalities" is derived from the word "emotion," which comes from the Old French word "emocioun" and ultimately from the Latin word "emovere," meaning "to move out" or "to stir up."  The suffix "-alities" is a pluralizing suffix indicating a state, quality, or condition.  Therefore, "emotionalities" refers to the various states, qualities, or conditions of emotion.
