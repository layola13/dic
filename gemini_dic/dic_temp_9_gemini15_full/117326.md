词源:  The word "meddlesomely" is derived from the adjective "meddlesome," which in turn comes from the verb "meddle."  "Meddle" has Old English roots, possibly connected to "midlian," meaning "to mix" or "to interfere."  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner in which something is done.
