词源:
The word "electro-acupuncture" is a compound word.  "Electro-" is a combining form derived from the Greek word "elektron," meaning "amber," which was known for its ability to attract light objects after being rubbed. This relates to the early understanding of electricity.  "Acupuncture" originates from the Latin word "acus" (needle) and "punctura" (pricking).  Therefore, "electro-acupuncture" literally means "needle pricking with electricity."
