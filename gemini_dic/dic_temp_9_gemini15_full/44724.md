cruise missiles:/ˈkruːz ˈmɪsəlz/| n.|巡航导弹|A cruise missile is a guided missile that sustains powered flight throughout its operational flight path. Unlike ballistic missiles, which follow a ballistic trajectory, cruise missiles fly at relatively low altitudes, often using terrain-following or terrain-hugging flight to evade detection.  They are typically propelled by jet engines and guided by onboard navigation systems, allowing for a high degree of precision in targeting.|Example: The military deployed several cruise missiles to strike the enemy's infrastructure.  军事部署了几枚巡航导弹打击敌人的基础设施。 The recent test of a new cruise missile demonstrated its accuracy and range. 最近新型巡航导弹的测试展示了它的精确度和射程。|近义词：guided missile, guided weapon|反义词：ballistic missile|名词
