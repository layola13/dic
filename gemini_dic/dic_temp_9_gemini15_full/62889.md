词源:  The word "enlightened" derives from the past participle of the verb "enlighten," which itself comes from the Old English "inlihtnian," meaning "to shine upon," "to illuminate," or "to make clear."  The prefix "en-" intensifies the meaning, and "lighten" refers to the metaphorical illumination of the mind.  The concept is strongly linked to the Enlightenment, a historical period emphasizing reason and individualism.
