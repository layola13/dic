词源:
The word "morigerous" is derived from the Latin words "mores" (meaning "customs" or "manners") and "gerere" (meaning "to bear" or "to carry").  Therefore, the original meaning implied someone who carried or behaved according to established customs or moral standards.  Over time, the meaning shifted to emphasize the obedient and submissive aspect.
