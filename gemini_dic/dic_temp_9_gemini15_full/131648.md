/ˌnɒnkəmˈpʌlsərɪlinəsiz/ | n. | 非强制性 | The state or quality of being noncompulsory; instances of noncompulsory actions or situations.  This word is extremely rare and largely artificial; it's unlikely to be encountered in everyday usage. It is formed by adding "-nesses" (a pluralizing suffix indicating qualities or states) to "noncompulsorily" (an adverb meaning "in a noncompulsory manner").  |  The increasing noncompulsorilynesses in the education system are leading to concerns about student engagement. (This sentence demonstrates the word's usage, but it would sound highly unnatural in typical contexts.) |  There are no readily available synonyms or antonyms for this exceptionally rare word. The meaning can be conveyed using more common phrases. For example, instead of "noncompulsorilynesses", you might say "instances of non-compulsion," "lack of compulsion," or "optional aspects". | n.


USAGE->

PHRASE->
Because "noncompulsorilynesses" is not a commonly used word, there are no established phrases associated with it.
