The word "explicitnesses" is derived from the adjective "explicit," which comes from the Latin word "explicitus," the past participle of "explicare," meaning "to unfold, to explain."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, indicating a state or quality.  The final "-es" indicates a plural form, referring to multiple instances of explicitness.
