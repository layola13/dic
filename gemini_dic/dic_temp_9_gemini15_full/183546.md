词源:
The word "reputatively" is derived from the noun "reputation," which comes from the Old French word "reputacions," ultimately from the Latin word "reputare," meaning "to think over, consider, reckon." The suffix "-tively" is an adverbial suffix indicating manner or means.  Therefore, "reputatively" signifies "in a manner relating to reputation" or "according to reputation."
