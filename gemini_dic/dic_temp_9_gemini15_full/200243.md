词源:

The word "skirmishing" comes from the Old French word "escarmouche," meaning "a slight encounter."  This word ultimately derives from the Old Italian "scaramuccia," a combination of "scaro" (scare) and "muccia" (a crowd).  Thus, the original sense reflected a chaotic and somewhat fearful encounter, fitting the definition of a minor battle.
