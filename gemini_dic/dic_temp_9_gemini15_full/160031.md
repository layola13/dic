polyterpene:/ˌpɒliˈtɜːpiːn/|/ˈpɑːliˌtɜːrpiːn/| n. |多萜|A polyterpene is a polymer composed of multiple isoprene units.  They are a large and diverse class of natural products found in plants, animals, and microorganisms.  They play various important biological roles, from structural components to signaling molecules. |Example: Carotenoids are examples of polyterpenes that are responsible for the vibrant colors in many fruits and vegetables.  类胡萝卜素是多萜的例子，它们是许多水果和蔬菜中鲜艳颜色的原因。|近义词：isoprenoid polymer|反义词：无
