hypocycloid:/ˈhaɪpəʊsaɪklɔɪd/| n. |次摆线|A hypocycloid is a curve traced by a point on a small circle rolling inside a larger circle.  It's a special type of cycloid. The shape of the hypocycloid depends on the ratio of the radii of the two circles.  For instance, a hypocycloid with a radius ratio of 1:3 is a deltoid, while a ratio of 1:4 yields an astroid.|The intricate design of the gear system utilized a hypocycloid curve to achieve smooth, efficient operation.  次摆线曲线被应用在齿轮系统的精巧设计中，以实现平稳高效的运行。|epicycloid, cycloid|—|
