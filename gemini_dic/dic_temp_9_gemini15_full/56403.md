词源:
The word "dole" ultimately derives from the Old English word "dǣlan," meaning "to divide" or "to deal out."  This reflects the original sense of distributing something, often in portions.  The modern sense of "unemployment benefit" developed later, reflecting a system of government-provided assistance.
