英文解析:
The word "nonauthentic" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "authentic."  Therefore, it directly signifies the opposite of authentic – something that is not genuine, real, or original. It can refer to objects, documents, experiences, or even feelings that lack genuineness.
