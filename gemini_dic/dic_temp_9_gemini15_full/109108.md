The word "leggiadro" is borrowed directly from Italian.  It ultimately derives from the Vulgar Latin *lexiādriu, a diminutive form possibly related to *lēx (law, rule) suggesting something that conforms to a pleasing standard of form or behavior.  The exact etymological path is debated, but the connection to a sense of "lightness" and "elegance" is clear in its evolution.
