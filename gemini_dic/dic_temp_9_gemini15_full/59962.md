词源:
From Middle English edificacioun, from Old French edificacion, from Latin aedificatio, from aedificare "to build," from aedes "building, temple" + -ficare "to make."  The original sense referred to building up, both literally and figuratively.  The modern meaning evolved from the figurative sense of building up character or intellect.
