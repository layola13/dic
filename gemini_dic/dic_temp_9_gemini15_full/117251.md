mechanicalism:/məˈkænɪsɪzəm/ | n. | 机械论；机械主义 | The philosophical theory that all phenomena, including life and consciousness, can be explained in terms of purely mechanical principles.  It emphasizes deterministic cause-and-effect relationships and denies the existence of free will or any non-physical forces.  | Example:  His rigid adherence to mechanicalism prevented him from appreciating the complexities of human behavior.  他的机械论的僵化坚持妨碍了他对人类行为复杂性的理解。

|Example:  The study rejected pure mechanicalism, arguing for a more holistic approach to understanding the system. 这项研究摒弃了纯粹的机械论，主张采用更整体的方法来理解该系统。| 近义词：determinism, materialism | 反义词：vitalism, holism |


词源:  The term "mechanicalism" originates from the word "mechanism," which comes from the Greek word "mēkhanē" (μηχανή), meaning "machine" or "contrivance."  The suffix "-ism" denotes a doctrine, system, or practice.  Therefore, mechanicalism literally means the belief in or adherence to a mechanistic worldview.


用法说明:

Mechanicalism can be used in different contexts:

1. **Philosophy:**  This is the most common usage, referring to the philosophical viewpoint that all events are ultimately caused by physical processes and that there is no room for free will or supernatural influence.

2. **Science:** In a scientific context, mechanicalism may refer to the application of mechanical principles to explain natural phenomena.  However, it is important to note that modern science often takes a more nuanced and holistic approach than strict mechanicalism.

3. **Literature and Art:**  Mechanicalism can be used metaphorically to describe something overly rigid, predictable, or lacking in creativity or spontaneity.  For example, a critic might describe a piece of art as exhibiting "mechanicalism" if it lacks originality or emotional depth.
