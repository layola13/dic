词源:  The word "obvoluted" is not a standard English word. It seems to be a misspelling or a less common variant of "convoluted," which itself comes from the Latin word "convolutus," meaning "rolled together" or "twisted."  The prefix "con-" means "together," and "volutus" is the past participle of "volvere," meaning "to roll."  Therefore, "convoluted" literally means "rolled together," and figuratively describes something complex and intricate.
