/ˈhaɪpəwiːk/| adj.|极弱的，超弱的| Extremely weak;  referring to a signal or effect that is significantly weaker than normal or expected.  This term is often used in scientific and technical contexts, particularly in fields like physics and signal processing.|例句：The hyperweak signal was barely detectable by the instrument.  仪器几乎检测不到超弱的信号。 The researchers observed a hyperweak interaction between the two particles. 研究人员观察到这两个粒子之间存在超弱的相互作用。|近义词：very weak, extremely faint, minuscule, feeble|反义词：strong, powerful, intense


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The signal is hyperweak. = 信号极弱。
The effect is hyperweak. = 效果极弱。

一般过去时:
The signal was hyperweak. = 信号曾经极弱。
The interaction was hyperweak. = 相互作用曾经极弱。

现在完成时:
The signal has remained hyperweak. = 信号一直很弱。
The effect has been hyperweak. = 效果一直很弱。

过去完成时:
The signal had been hyperweak before the amplification. = 放大之前，信号一直很弱。
The interaction had been hyperweak until the conditions changed. = 直到条件改变之前，相互作用一直很弱。

将来时:
The signal will likely remain hyperweak. = 信号可能会继续很弱。
The effect will probably be hyperweak. = 效果可能会很弱。

虚拟语气:
If the signal were hyperweak, we would need a more sensitive detector. = 如果信号很弱，我们需要更灵敏的探测器。
I wish the interaction were not hyperweak. = 我希望相互作用不要那么弱。

被动语态:
The hyperweak signal was easily masked by noise. = 微弱的信号很容易被噪声掩盖。
The hyperweak effect was not observed in the initial experiment. = 在最初的实验中没有观察到超弱的效果。

疑问句:
Is the signal hyperweak? = 信号很弱吗？
Is the interaction hyperweak? = 相互作用很弱吗？

否定句:
The signal is not hyperweak; it's quite strong. = 信号并不弱，它相当强。
The effect is not hyperweak; it's easily measurable. = 效果并不弱，很容易测量。


PHRASE->
There is no common phrase using "hyperweak".  The word is primarily used as a standalone adjective in scientific contexts.
