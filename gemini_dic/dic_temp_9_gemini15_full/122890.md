词源:
The word "mollycoddle" is of uncertain origin, but it's believed to be a combination of "molly" (a term of endearment, possibly related to "Mary") and "coddle" (to treat tenderly or pamper).  The exact etymology remains debated, but the sense of excessive indulgence is clear from its early usage.
