词源:

Irreconcilability derives from the prefix "ir-" (meaning "not"), "reconcile" (meaning "to restore harmony"), and the suffix "-ability" (meaning "the quality or state of being").  Therefore, it literally means "the state of not being able to be reconciled."  "Reconcile" itself has Latin roots, tracing back to *re- (again) and *concilio (to bring together).
