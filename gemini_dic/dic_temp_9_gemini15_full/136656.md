/ˌnɑːnˈskʌlptʃərəli/ | adj. | 非雕塑地，非雕刻地 | Not in a sculptural manner; lacking the qualities of sculpture.  The building's design was nonsculpturally plain.  | 近义词：unsculpturally, uncarved, plain, unadorned | 反义词：sculpturally, carved, ornate, embellished


The word "nonsculpturally" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adverb "sculpturally".  "Sculpturally" is derived from "sculpture," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "sculptura," meaning "a carving, sculpture."  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective "sculptural" into an adverb, modifying verbs and describing how an action is performed.  Therefore, "nonsculpturally" describes something done without the characteristics or style associated with sculpture.


例句：

The furniture was arranged nonsculpturally, in a purely functional manner. = 家具摆放得毫无雕塑感，纯粹是为了实用。

The architect designed the building nonsculpturally, prioritizing functionality over aesthetics. = 建筑师的设计缺乏雕塑感，优先考虑功能而不是美观。


因为“nonsculpturally”本身是一个较为罕见的词，所以没有常见的语法变化例句，也没有常用的词组搭配。  其用法局限于描述缺乏雕塑感的特征或方式。
