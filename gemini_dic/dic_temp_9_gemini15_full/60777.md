WORD ORIGIN->

The word "electromagnetic" is a compound word formed from "electro-" (relating to electricity) and "-magnetic" (relating to magnetism).  Both "electro-" and "-magnetic" have Greek origins.  "Electro-" comes from the Greek word "elektron," meaning "amber," which was known for its ability to attract light objects after being rubbed. "-magnetic" derives from "magnet," ultimately from the Greek word "magnētis lithos," meaning "Magnesian stone," referring to the naturally occurring magnetic mineral magnetite found near Magnesia in ancient Greece. Therefore, the word's etymology traces back to ancient Greek observations of both static electricity and magnetism.
