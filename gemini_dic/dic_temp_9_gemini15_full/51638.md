The word "deviabilities" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).

If it was intended to be a word, it might be a derivation attempting to create a plural noun related to "deviability," which itself isn't a commonly used word but could be understood as a state or instance of deviating from a norm or standard.  However, even then, the correct plural would likely be "deviabilities" (though still uncommon).

Therefore, a detailed analysis in the requested format is impossible. To provide helpful information, we need a correctly spelled word or clarification of the intended meaning.  If you can provide the intended word or context, I can offer a detailed analysis.
