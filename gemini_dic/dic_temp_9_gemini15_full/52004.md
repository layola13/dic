diagonalization: /ˌdaɪˌæɡənəlaɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 对角化；对角线化 | The process of transforming a matrix into a diagonal matrix, where all off-diagonal elements are zero.  This is often done through finding the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix.  Diagonalization simplifies many matrix operations, such as calculating powers or solving systems of differential equations. | Example:  The diagonalization of the matrix allowed for a much simpler calculation of its exponential.  对角化该矩阵使得其指数计算大大简化。 |近义词：diagonalisation (BrE spelling) | 反义词：None directly applicable.
