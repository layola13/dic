WORD ORIGIN->
The word "overscrupulously" is formed by the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively"), the adjective "scrupulous" (meaning "diligent, thorough, and extremely attentive to details"), and the adverbial suffix "-ly".  "Scrupulous" itself has Latin roots, stemming from  "scrupulus," meaning "a small sharp stone," which metaphorically came to represent a "misgiving" or a "doubt." The meticulous attention to detail implied in the word reflects this original sense of carefully avoiding even the smallest potential problem.


USAGE->
This word is primarily used to describe actions performed with excessive care and attention to detail, often to a point where it becomes counterproductive or inefficient.  There is no specific tense conjugation as it is an adverb.  It modifies verbs.
