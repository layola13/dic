prochiral:/ˈproʊkaɪrəl/ | adj. | 前手性的 | Describing a molecule that is achiral (not chiral) but that can be converted into a chiral molecule by a single alteration.  A prochiral molecule lacks a chiral center, but contains a prochiral center, which is an atom bonded to two identical substituents (such as two hydrogens) that, upon replacement of one of the substituents with a different group, would create a chiral center.  | Example:  A methylene group (CH2) in a molecule is prochiral because replacing one of the hydrogens with a different atom or group converts it into a chiral center. | 近义词: prechiral | 反义词: chiral


例句：

The methylene group in ethanol is prochiral. = 乙醇中的亚甲基是前手性的。

Replacing one of the hydrogens on the prochiral carbon of ethanol with a deuterium atom creates a chiral molecule. = 用氘原子取代乙醇前手性碳上的一个氢原子会产生一个手性分子。
