词源:

The word "infantilises" comes from the Latin word "infans," meaning "unable to speak," and subsequently came to mean "child."  The suffix "-ise" (or "-ize") is used to form transitive verbs, meaning "to make or become."  Therefore, "infantilises" means "to make childlike or treat like a child."
