oozoa:/oʊˈzoʊə/| n. |卵生动物|An oozoa is a hypothetical, extinct, single-celled organism proposed as an ancestor to all animals.  It's a theoretical concept, not a definitively identified species. The term is rarely used in modern scientific literature.|例句：The theory of the oozoa as the common ancestor of all animals is still debated.|近义词:protozoa(单细胞生物) |反义词:None


USAGE->
The word "oozoa" itself doesn't have a grammatical usage like "what" in the example.  It's a noun referring to a hypothetical organism. Therefore, typical tense, voice, or sentence structure examples aren't applicable.  The following illustrate how the word might be used in a sentence:

一般现在时:
The oozoa is believed to be the ancestor of all animals. = 人们认为卵生动物是所有动物的祖先。
Scientists study the hypothetical oozoa to understand animal evolution. = 科学家们研究假设的卵生动物以了解动物的进化。


一般过去时:
The existence of the oozoa was proposed in the early 20th century. = 卵生动物的存在是在20世纪初提出的。
Researchers discussed the characteristics of the proposed oozoa. = 研究人员讨论了所提出的卵生动物的特征。


现在完成时:
Scientists have not yet found definitive proof of the oozoa. = 科学家们尚未找到卵生动物的确凿证据。
Researchers have debated the implications of the oozoa theory for decades. = 几十年来，研究人员一直在争论卵生动物理论的意义。


过去完成时:
Before the oozoa theory, the origin of animals was less understood. = 在卵生动物理论之前，人们对动物的起源了解较少。
They had already considered several other hypotheses before proposing the oozoa. = 在提出卵生动物理论之前，他们已经考虑了其他几种假设。


将来时:
Further research will hopefully clarify the existence of the oozoa. = 今后的研究有望阐明卵生动物的存在。
Scientists will continue to study the potential evidence for the oozoa. = 科学家们将继续研究卵生动物的潜在证据。


虚拟语气:
If the oozoa existed, it would revolutionize our understanding of animal evolution. = 如果卵生动物存在，它将彻底改变我们对动物进化的理解。
It is highly unlikely that the oozoa would have survived to the present day. = 卵生动物极不可能存活至今。


被动语态:
The oozoa's characteristics were inferred from fossil evidence. = 卵生动物的特征是从化石证据中推断出来的。
The existence of the oozoa is being debated among scientists. = 卵生动物的存在正在科学家之间争论。


疑问句:
What evidence supports the existence of the oozoa? = 有什么证据支持卵生动物的存在？
Could the oozoa have been the ancestor of all multicellular life? = 卵生动物可能是所有多细胞生物的祖先吗？


否定句:
The oozoa is not a currently accepted species. = 卵生动物不是一个目前被接受的物种。
The oozoa theory has not been definitively proven. = 卵生动物理论尚未得到确切证明。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly related to "oozoa" as it is a highly specialized scientific term.  Phrases would be contextual and relate to its theoretical nature and position in evolutionary biology.  For example:

the hypothetical oozoa
the proposed oozoa ancestor
evidence for the oozoa
the oozoa theory
the oozoa's characteristics
