iterable:/ˈɪtərəbəl/| adj.| 可迭代的 | An iterable is an object capable of returning its members one at a time, permitting it to be iterated over in a for loop.  It's a sequence of values that can be accessed one after another.  Iterables can be used in for loops, list comprehensions, and other constructs that require iteration. | Example:  A list is an iterable; you can loop through each element.  The string "hello" is also an iterable because you can iterate over its characters. |近义词：iteratable, traversable |反义词：non-iterable


Example 1:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for item in my_list:
    print(item) # This works because my_list is iterable
```
This works because `my_list` is iterable. = 这有效是因为`my_list`是可迭代的。


Example 2:
```python
my_string = "hello"
for char in my_string:
    print(char) # This also works because strings are iterable
```
This also works because strings are iterable. = 这也奏效，因为字符串是可迭代的。


Etymology:
The word "iterable" is derived from the verb "iterate," meaning to repeat or do something again and again.  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or suitability.  Therefore, "iterable" describes something that is capable of being iterated over.  The root traces back to Latin *iterare* ("to repeat").

Note: There is no verb form of "iterable".  The action is described by verbs like "iterate" or "traverse".
