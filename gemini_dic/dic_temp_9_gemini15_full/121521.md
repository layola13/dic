词源:
The word "mislodge" is a combination of the prefix "mis-" (meaning "wrongly" or "badly") and the verb "lodge" (meaning "to place" or "to reside").  Therefore, it literally means "to place wrongly."  The verb "lodge" itself has roots in Old English and ultimately comes from related Germanic words.
