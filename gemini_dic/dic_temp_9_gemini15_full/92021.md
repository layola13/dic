hyperoxymuriate: /ˌhaɪpərɒksɪˈmjʊəriˌeɪt/ | n. | 次氯酸盐，高氯酸盐 | A now-obsolete term for a compound containing a high proportion of oxygen, especially a chlorate or perchlorate.  The term reflects older understanding of chemical nomenclature. | Example:  The chemist analyzed the hyperoxymuriate to determine its composition.  （化学家分析了次氯酸盐以确定其成分。） | 近义词: chlorate, perchlorate | 反义词: (no direct antonym,  but compounds with less oxygen could be considered opposite in the context of the obsolete term) | 名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
