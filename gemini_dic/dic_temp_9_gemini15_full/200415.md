词源:

The word "slabbiness" derives from the noun "slab," meaning a large, flat piece of something (stone, wood, etc.).  The suffix "-iness" adds the meaning of "the quality or state of being."  Therefore, "slabbiness" originally implied the quality of being like a slab –  large, flat, and potentially lacking shape or firmness.  Over time, the meaning has shifted to emphasize the lack of firmness and often the poor quality associated with something shapeless or loosely constructed.
