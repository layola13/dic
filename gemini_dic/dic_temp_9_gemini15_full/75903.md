词源:
The word "fundraise" is a relatively modern blend of "fund" and "raise."  "Fund" comes from Old French "fond," meaning "bottom, base," later referring to a supply of money. "Raise" comes from Old English "rǣsan," meaning "to lift, erect." Thus, "fundraise" literally means "to lift or collect funds."
