词源:  The word "irreflective" is formed from the prefix "ir-" (meaning "not") + "reflective".  "Reflective" comes from the verb "reflect," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "reflectere," meaning "to bend back," "to turn back."  The sense of "thinking deeply" evolved from the literal meaning of light or image being reflected.
