词源:
The word "penknife" is a compound word.  "Pen" originally referred to a type of writing tool, and a penknife was originally a knife used to sharpen quills, which were used as writing implements. Over time, the word came to refer to any small, folding knife suitable for carrying in a pocket.  The "pen" in penknife is thus etymologically related to the writing tool but practically refers to its size and portability.
