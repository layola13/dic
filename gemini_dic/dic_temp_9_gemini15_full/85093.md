词源:

The word combines "hard" (meaning firm, unyielding) and "bitten" (past participle of "bite," suggesting something has been worn down or affected by harsh experiences). The original imagery likely relates to someone whose face is weathered and worn, like it has been "bitten" by the elements.  The usage evolved to encompass a broader sense of emotional toughness and resilience.
