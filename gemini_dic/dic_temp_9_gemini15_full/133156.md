The word "nonethnics" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, let's explore potential interpretations and related concepts:

If "nonethnics" were intended to mean something, it might be trying to convey the opposite of "ethnics," referring to people who are not of a particular ethnic group or people who lack a strong sense of ethnic identity. However, this is a clumsy and potentially offensive way to express this idea.  More appropriate and precise language should be used.

Here are some possible alternative phrases and their analyses, which might be what the user intended:

**1. Non-ethnic:**

/ˌnɑːnˈeθnɪk/ | adj. | 非种族的，非民族的 | Referring to something not related to ethnicity or ethnic groups. | Example: The study focused on non-ethnic factors contributing to poverty.  这项研究关注导致贫困的非种族因素。| Near Synonyms:  race-neutral, culturally neutral | Antonyms: ethnic, ethnically-based


**2. People of non-specific ethnic backgrounds:**

/ˈpiːpəl əv ˌnɑːn spəˈsɪfɪk ˈeθnɪk ˈbækˌɡraʊndz/ | n. phrase |  具有非特定种族背景的人 |  A more accurate and respectful way to refer to a diverse group of people whose ethnicities are unknown or not relevant to the context. | Example: The survey included participants of non-specific ethnic backgrounds.  调查包括具有非特定种族背景的参与者。| Near Synonyms: people from diverse backgrounds, individuals from various ethnicities | Antonyms:  people from a specific ethnic group


**3. Individuals without a strong ethnic identity:**

/ˌɪndɪˈvɪdʒuəlz wɪˈðaʊt ə strɒŋ ˈeθnɪk aɪˈdentɪti/ | n. phrase |  没有强烈民族认同感的人 |  This phrase acknowledges that ethnic identity is a complex and personal matter. | Example:  Many individuals without a strong ethnic identity feel disconnected from their heritage. 许多没有强烈民族认同感的人感到与他们的传统脱节。| Near Synonyms: people with weak ethnic ties, individuals lacking a sense of ethnic belonging | Antonyms: people with a strong ethnic identity


Remember, using precise and respectful language is crucial when discussing ethnicity and cultural identity.  Avoid ambiguous or potentially offensive terms like "nonethnics."
