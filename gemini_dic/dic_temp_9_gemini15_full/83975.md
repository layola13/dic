词源:  The word combines "half," meaning partly or to some extent, with "crazed," which derives from the Old French word "craser," meaning "to break" or "to crush."  Over time, "crazed" came to describe a mental state characterized by a sense of being broken or shattered, thus leading to its association with madness.
