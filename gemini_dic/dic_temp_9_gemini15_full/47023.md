The word "dasty" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it in major resources like Merriam-Webster, Oxford English Dictionary, or Cambridge Dictionary.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical explanations as requested.  If there was a misspelling or it's a very niche or informal term, please provide more context so I can assist you better.
