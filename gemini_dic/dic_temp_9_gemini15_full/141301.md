WORD ORIGIN->
The word "open-mindedness" is a compound word.  "Open" comes from Old English *open, meaning "unclosed, free, visible, frank."  "Minded" comes from Old English *gemynd, meaning "memory, mind, intention."  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix forming nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, "open-mindedness" literally describes the state of having an open mind.
