词源:
The word "dabble" ultimately derives from the Old English word "dabbian," meaning "to strike gently," or "to pat."  This suggests a connection to the light, playful touch associated with the word's modern meanings.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the idea of superficial involvement, as well as the literal act of splashing water.
