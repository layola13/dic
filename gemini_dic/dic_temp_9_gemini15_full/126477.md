词源:
The word "mythologize" is a relatively modern verb formed from the noun "mythology" and the suffix "-ize," which indicates the act of making something or doing something.  "Mythology" itself derives from the Greek words "mythos" (μῦθος), meaning "story," "tale," or "speech," and "logia" (λογία), meaning "study" or "account."  Thus, "mythologize" essentially means to create or treat something as a myth or a legendary story.
