odometries:/oʊˈdɑːmɪtriz/| n. |里程计测量；里程计算法|The process of estimating the position and orientation of a robot by integrating the measurements from its motion sensors (e.g., wheel encoders).  Odometry is crucial for robot navigation and localization.  It is susceptible to error accumulation over time due to wheel slippage and other factors.|Example:  The robot's odometry data indicated it had traveled 10 meters, but its actual position was slightly different due to wheel slippage.  The accuracy of the odometry is critical for autonomous navigation.|近义词：position estimation, motion tracking|反义词：N/A


USAGE->
