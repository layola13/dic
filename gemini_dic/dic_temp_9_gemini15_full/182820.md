repeatabilities: /ˌriːpiːtəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可重复性，可复制性 | The ability of a process or measurement to produce the same results consistently under the same conditions.  It refers to the degree to which an experiment, test, or measurement can be repeated with similar results.  High repeatability indicates a reliable and consistent process. | Example: The high repeatability of the experiment validated the findings.  这个实验的高度可重复性验证了研究结果。

The experiment's high repeatability demonstrated the robustness of the method.  该实验的高度可重复性证明了该方法的稳健性。|近义词：reproducibility, consistency, reliability | 反义词：inconsistency, unreliability, variability |


USAGE->
