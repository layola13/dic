noncongealings:/ˌnɒnkənˈdʒiːlɪŋz/ | n. | 不凝固物；不凝结物 | Substances that do not solidify or coagulate under normal conditions.  This word is rarely used and usually appears in scientific or technical contexts.  It's the plural form of the less common "noncongealing". | Example: The study focused on the properties of certain noncongealings found in the deep ocean.  这项研究关注的是在深海中发现的某些不凝固物的特性。 | 近义词: unsolidified substances, liquids that remain fluid | 反义词: coagulants, solidifying agents | 名词


USAGE->
