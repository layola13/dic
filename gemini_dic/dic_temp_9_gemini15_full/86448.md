The word "hefter" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a very specialized field, or a word from a dialect not widely documented.

To provide a helpful response, please double-check the spelling or provide more context about where you encountered this word.  If you can provide the source, I might be able to offer a more accurate interpretation.
