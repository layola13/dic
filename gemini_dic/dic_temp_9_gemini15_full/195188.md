This word is not commonly used.  It's a very complex and unwieldy noun formed from:

* **semi-:**  A prefix meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."
* **dictatorial:** An adjective meaning "characteristic of a dictator; tyrannical; autocratic."
* **-ness:** A suffix that turns an adjective into a noun, signifying a state, quality, or condition.  It indicates "the state or quality of being dictatorial".


Therefore, "semidictatorialnesses" refers to the various instances or aspects of a system or government that exhibits characteristics of a dictatorship, but not to the full extent.  It suggests a blend of dictatorial and non-dictatorial elements.  The plural form ("nesses") emphasizes the multiplicity of these semi-dictatorial traits.

Because of its complexity and rarity, providing examples of its usage in various tenses is not practical.  The word itself is a rather academic or highly specialized term unlikely to appear in casual conversation or everyday writing.  The sentence example above demonstrates its usage.  One might use it in a scholarly analysis of political systems or historical periods.
