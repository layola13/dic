USAGE->
This word is unusual and likely a grammatical error. "Hookedness" itself is a noun, and adding "'s" creates a possessive, referring to something *belonging* to the state of being hooked.  Therefore, typical grammatical tenses and structures don't directly apply.  Instead, examples illustrate how the possessive would be used in a sentence.
