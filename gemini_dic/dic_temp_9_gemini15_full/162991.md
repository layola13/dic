词源:
The word "precipitously" derives from the Latin word "praecipitare," meaning "to throw headlong," "to hasten," or "to precipitate."  The prefix "prae-" means "before" or "forward," and "capitare" means "to fall head first."  The sense of suddenness and steepness developed over time from the original meaning of headlong fall.
