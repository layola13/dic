词源:
The word "practice" comes from the Old French word "practique," meaning "practice, experience, skill."  This in turn derives from the Late Latin word "practica," which is a feminine form of "practicus," meaning "practical, active."  The ultimate root is the Latin verb "practicāre," meaning "to practice, to do, to perform."
