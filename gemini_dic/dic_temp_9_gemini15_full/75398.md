The word "frto" is not a recognized word in the English language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible there's a typographical error, or it's a word from a specialized field or a neologism (newly coined word) not yet widely recognized.  Please double-check the spelling or provide more context.
