refract:/rɪˈfrækt/| vt.| 折射，使弯曲 | To alter the course of a ray of light, heat, or sound by passing it through a medium.| 例句：The prism refracted the white light into a spectrum of colors.  棱镜将白光折射成彩色光谱。

例句：The lens refracts the light, focusing it onto a single point. 透镜折射光线，将其聚焦到一个点上。


近义词：bend, deflect, diffract | 反义词：reflect (in the context of light)


词源:  from Latin *refringere "to break up," from re- "back" + frangere "to break."  The original sense was to break or shatter, but the scientific meaning of bending light developed later.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The lens refracts light. = 透镜折射光线。
Water refracts light differently than air. = 水的折射光线的方式与空气不同。


一般过去时:
The prism refracted the sunlight. = 棱镜折射了阳光。
The scientist refracted the laser beam. = 科学家折射了激光束。


现在完成时:
Scientists have refracted light using various materials. = 科学家们已经利用各种材料折射光线。
The experiment has refracted the beam successfully. = 实验成功地折射了光束。


过去完成时:
The researchers had refracted the light before making observations. = 研究人员在进行观察之前已经折射了光线。
They had refracted the beam several times already. = 他们已经多次折射光束了。


将来时:
We will refract the light through a different medium. = 我们将通过不同的介质折射光线。
The experiment will refract the beam precisely. = 实验将精确地折射光束。


虚拟语气:
If we used a different lens, we would refract the light differently. = 如果我们使用不同的透镜，我们将以不同的方式折射光线。
If the material were denser, it would refract the light more. = 如果材料更致密，它将更多地折射光线。


被动语态:
Light is refracted by the lens. = 光线被透镜折射。
The beam was refracted by the prism. = 光束被棱镜折射。


疑问句:
How does the lens refract the light? = 透镜如何折射光线？
Does water refract light more than air? = 水比空气更能折射光线吗？


否定句:
The material does not refract light effectively. = 该材料不能有效地折射光线。
The experiment did not refract the beam as expected. = 实验没有按预期折射光束。


PHRASE->
refractive index 折射率
refractive power  折射能力
refractive error  屈光不正
