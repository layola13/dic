词源:

The word "extensively" derives from the adjective "extensive," which itself comes from the Latin word "extensus," the past participle of "extendere," meaning "to stretch out" or "to spread out."  The prefix "ex-" means "out" or "from," and "tendere" means "to stretch."  Therefore, "extensive" originally described something that was stretched out or spread over a large area.  The adverbial form "-ly" was added to create "extensively," modifying verbs and adjectives to indicate the manner in which an action is performed or a quality is possessed.


用法说明:

"Extensively" describes something done or existing over a large area, to a great degree, or in great detail. It emphasizes breadth, thoroughness, or comprehensiveness.
