词源:

The word "privileging" comes from the noun "privilege," which originates from the Old French word "privilege," ultimately deriving from the Latin "privilegium."  "Privilegium" itself is a combination of "privus" (private) and "legis" (law), suggesting a special law or right granted to an individual or group.
