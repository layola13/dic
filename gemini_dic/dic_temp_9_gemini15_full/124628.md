词源:
The word "mousy" ultimately derives from "mouse," referring to the small rodent.  The connection lies in the association of mice with being timid, quiet, and having a dull, grayish-brown color.  The adjective developed to describe those characteristics in people and things, taking on both the color and personality aspects of the animal.
