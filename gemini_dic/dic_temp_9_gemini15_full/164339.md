词源:

The word is a combination of "pre" (meaning before) + "eligibility" (the state of being eligible).  "Eligibility" itself comes from the word "eligible," which has roots in Old French *eligible* and ultimately from Latin *eligere* (to choose).  Therefore, "preeligibilities" literally means "things that must be met before being chosen or qualified."
