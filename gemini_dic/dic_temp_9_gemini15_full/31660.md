词源:
The word "chatteringly" is derived from the verb "chatter," which comes from the Middle English word "chateren," ultimately from Old French "chacier" (to chase, to clatter) and possibly influenced by Old Norse "kjattra" (to chatter).  The "-ingly" suffix indicates a manner or way of doing something.
