词源：

The word "persona" comes from the Latin word "persona," meaning "mask," "character," or "role" in a play.  In ancient Roman theatre, actors wore masks to represent different characters.  The word's evolution reflects this theatrical origin, extending to encompass the various roles and facades people adopt in life.
