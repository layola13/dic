词源:
The word "friendship" comes from the Old English word "frēondscype," which is a combination of "frēond" (friend) and "-scype" (ship, condition, state).  The word "friend" itself has Germanic roots, ultimately deriving from Proto-Germanic *frijōnd, meaning "lover, beloved."  The "-ship" suffix indicates a state or condition, thus "friendship" signifies the state of being friends.
