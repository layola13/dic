词源:
The word "nostalgic" is derived from the Greek word "nostos" (νόστος), meaning "return home," and "algos" (ἄλγος), meaning "pain" or "ache."  The combination originally referred to a specific type of homesickness, a painful longing for home.  Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass a more general yearning for the past.
