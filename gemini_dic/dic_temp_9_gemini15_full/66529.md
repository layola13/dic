词源:
The word "exhausting" comes from the verb "exhaust," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "exhauster," meaning "to empty, drain."  The suffix "-ing" transforms the verb into its present participle, functioning as an adjective in this case.  The sense of being completely drained of energy is a natural extension of the original meaning.
