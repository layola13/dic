The word "othergates" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very niche dialect or context.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following your requested format.  To help you, I need more context where you encountered this word.  Was it in a book, a song, a conversation?  Knowing the source might help determine its intended meaning and allow for a more accurate response.
