The word "insetters" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a newly coined word, a misspelling, or a word specific to a niche field.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and detailed grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we'd need more context about where you encountered this word.


If you can provide the source where you saw "insetters", or the sentence in which it was used, I can offer a more informed guess at its meaning and possible usage.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:** Could it be a misspelling of another word?  Please double-check the spelling.
* **A neologism (newly coined word):**  If it's a new word, the meaning would depend entirely on its context.
* **A technical term:** It might be jargon specific to a particular field (e.g., engineering, printing).

Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.
