词源:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of."
* **promiscuous**:  Derived from Latin "promiscuus," meaning "common," "mixed," or "indiscriminate." This word originally had a broader meaning, referring to a lack of order or selection in general.  Its modern sexual connotation developed later.
* **-ly**:  An adverbial suffix indicating manner or way.


Therefore, "nonpromiscuously" literally means "not in a promiscuous manner."
