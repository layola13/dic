The word "cromby" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage explanation cannot be provided.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?

2. **It's a dialect word or slang:**  It might be used within a specific region or community, but lacks broader recognition.  If you can provide context (where you encountered the word), it might be possible to offer a more informed guess.

3. **It's a newly coined word or neologism:**  In this case, there would be no established etymology or usage.
