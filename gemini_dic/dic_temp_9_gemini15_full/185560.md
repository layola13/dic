revealablenesses: /rɪˌviːləˈbɪlnəsɪz/ | n. | 可揭示性；可显露性 |  The potential for something to be revealed or made known; the quality or state of being revealable.  This word is extremely rare and largely theoretical. It suggests a plurality of things that *could* be revealed.  The word is formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" (indicating plurality of qualities) to "revealable," which itself is derived from "reveal."  | 例句：The revealablenesses of the investigation were limited by the lack of evidence.  调查的可揭示性由于缺乏证据而受到限制。  The multiple revealablenesses of the situation were carefully considered before making a decision. 在做决定之前，人们仔细考虑了情况的多种可揭示性。| 近义词：disclosures, exposés (referring to the act of revealing, not the potential) | 反义词：secrecy, confidentiality, concealment | n.
