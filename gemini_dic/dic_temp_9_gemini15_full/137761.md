/nɒnˈvɑːrɪətiz/ | n. | 非品种；非变种 |  The term "nonvarieties" refers to things that lack the characteristics of a variety, typically in contexts where varieties are clearly defined, such as in linguistics (language varieties) or biology (plant or animal varieties).  It essentially means things that are not considered distinct or separate types within a larger group.  The word is less common than its opposite, "varieties," and often appears in scientific or technical writing. |  The study focused on the nonvarieties of wheat found in the region, which lacked the desirable traits of the commercially grown varieties. = 这项研究的重点是该地区发现的非小麦品种，这些品种缺乏商业化种植品种的理想特性。
