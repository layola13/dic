The word "{ptor}" is not a recognized English word.  There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries or etymological resources.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* It's a technical term from a specific field (e.g., scientific, medical).  If so, please provide context.
* It's a neologism (newly coined word) or slang.  Again, context would be helpful.
