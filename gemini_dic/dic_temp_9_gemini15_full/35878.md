cockyolly: /ˈkɒkiɒli/ | adj. | 狂妄自大的；傲慢的 |  This word is archaic and rarely used in modern English. It describes someone who is cocky and self-satisfied, often to an excessive degree.

It suggests a flamboyant and perhaps slightly foolish display of self-importance. | 例句：He strutted around with a cockyolly air, believing himself superior to everyone else. 他趾高气扬地走来走去，认为自己比其他人优越。


近义词：cocky, arrogant, conceited, supercilious, presumptuous | 反义词：humble, modest, meek, unassuming
