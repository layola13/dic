词源:

The word "gemminess" is derived from the word "gem," meaning a precious stone.  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun signifying the quality or state of being like a gem.  Therefore, the word's origin traces back to the Old English word "gim," meaning "precious stone," which evolved through Middle English and eventually to the modern "gem."
