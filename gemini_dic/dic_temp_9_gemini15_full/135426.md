/nɒnˌpɜːsɪˈvɪərənsɪz/ | n. | 不坚持；缺乏毅力；半途而废 | The word "nonperseverances" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism formed by adding the prefix "non-" to the noun "perseverances," meaning the act of persevering or the instances of persevering. Therefore, "nonperseverances" would refer to instances of *not* persevering, failures to persist, or acts of giving up.  It is highly unlikely to be encountered in common usage.  A more natural way to express this concept would be to use phrases like "lack of perseverance," "instances of giving up," or "failures to persist." |  The project failed due to the team's numerous nonperseverances.  (This sentence uses the word, but it's stylistically awkward.  A better alternative would be: "The project failed due to the team's lack of perseverance.") | lack of persistence, giving up, abandonment | perseverance, persistence, tenacity
