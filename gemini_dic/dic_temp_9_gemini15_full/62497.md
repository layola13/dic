endothecium: /ˌɛndoʊˈθiːsiəm/ | n. | 内皮层 | The innermost layer of the anther wall in flowering plants, which is usually thickened and helps in the dehiscence (splitting open) of the anther to release pollen.  It's composed of specialized cells that undergo changes during anther development, leading to the eventual opening of the anther. | Example: The endothecium's hygroscopic properties are crucial for the efficient dispersal of pollen. 内皮层的吸湿性对于花粉的有效传播至关重要。 | 近义词：inner anther wall ( less precise) | 反义词：exothecium (outer anther wall)


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in botany and plant biology. Therefore,  verb conjugations, tenses, etc.,  don't directly apply to "endothecium" as a noun itself, but rather to the verbs and clauses used in sentences *describing* its function or properties.

Here are examples using the word "endothecium" in different sentence structures:

Simple Sentence: The endothecium plays a vital role in pollen release. 内皮层在花粉释放中起着至关重要的作用。

Complex Sentence: Because the endothecium thickens and dries, the anther splits open, releasing pollen. 因为内皮层增厚并干燥，花药裂开，释放花粉。


Compound Sentence:  The endothecium is composed of specialized cells; these cells undergo changes during anther development. 内皮层由特化的细胞组成；这些细胞在花药发育过程中会发生变化。

Passive Voice: The function of the endothecium is often overlooked in introductory botany courses. 内皮层的功能在植物学入门课程中经常被忽视。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "endothecium."  Phrases would involve describing the endothecium's function or properties within a larger botanical context.  For example:

"The development of the endothecium"  内皮层的发育
"The structure of the endothecium" 内皮层的结构
"The role of the endothecium in pollen dispersal" 内皮层在花粉传播中的作用
"The hygroscopic properties of the endothecium" 内皮层的吸湿特性
"Changes in the endothecium during anther dehiscence" 花药开裂过程中内皮层的变化
