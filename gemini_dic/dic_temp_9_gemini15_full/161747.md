词源:  The word "powerfully" derives from the adjective "powerful," which itself comes from the Old English words "power" (meaning strength or ability) and the suffix "-ful" (meaning "full of").  The adverbial suffix "-ly" is added to create "powerfully."  The evolution reflects a gradual building of the word from its core meaning of strength to its current usage describing actions or qualities exhibiting that strength.
