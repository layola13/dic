词源:
The word "canard" comes from the Old French word "canart," meaning "duck."  The connection is somewhat obscure, but it's thought that the term originated in the 16th century, possibly referencing a decoy duck used in hunting, implying something false or deceptive used to lure someone.  The modern meaning evolved over time from its earlier use to describe a fabricated story.
