词源:
The word "executive" comes from the Latin word "exsecutivus," meaning "carrying out,"  "performing," or "executing."  It is derived from the verb "exsequi," meaning "to follow out," "to execute," or "to accomplish."  The word's evolution reflects its core meaning: the carrying out of decisions and actions.
