USAGE->
This word is grammatically unusual.  "Notedness" is a noun, and adding "'s" creates a possessive form referring to something belonging to notedness.  There is no standard grammatical usage of "notedness's".  It's likely a mistake in grammar or an attempt to create a unique, unconventional term.  Providing examples of grammatical tenses etc would be inappropriate as the phrase is not standard English.

PHRASE->
Because "notedness's" is not a standard phrase, there are no common phrases to list.
