词源:
The word "scuzzy" is a relatively recent addition to the English language, likely originating as informal slang in the mid-20th century. Its etymology isn't definitively traced to a single source, but it probably developed through a combination of onomatopoeia (sound-based word formation) and association with words suggesting dirtiness and unpleasantness.  The "-ier" suffix is a comparative adjective ending, implying a greater degree of the quality described by the root word.
