refringency: /rɪˈfrɪndʒənsi/ | n. | 折射率，屈光度 | The degree to which a substance bends light.  It is a measure of how much a material slows down light compared to its speed in a vacuum.  High refringency indicates a greater bending of light. | Example: The high refringency of diamond makes it sparkle brilliantly.  钻石的高折射率使其闪闪发光。 The refringency of the lens is crucial for its focusing power. 透镜的折射率对其聚焦能力至关重要。| 近义词：refractive index, optical density | 反义词： (no direct antonym, but low refringency could be considered an opposite concept) |  词性：名词
