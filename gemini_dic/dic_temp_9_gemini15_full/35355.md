Etymology:  The word "co-guardianship" is a compound word.  "Co-" is a prefix meaning "together" or "jointly," derived from Latin "com-" (together) + "guardianship," which itself is derived from "guardian" + "-ship."  "Guardian" originates from Old French "gardien," ultimately from Latin "guardare" (to look, watch, guard). "-ship" is an English suffix denoting status, condition, or skill.  Therefore, co-guardianship literally means the "joint status of guardianship."
