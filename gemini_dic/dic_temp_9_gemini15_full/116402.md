词源:

The word "masturbator" is derived from the verb "masturbate," which itself has a complex etymology.  Ultimately, it comes from the Latin word "manus" (hand) and "stubere" (to pollute or defile).  The term gained prominence in the 18th and 19th centuries, often used in a moralistic and condemnatory context.  The term "masturbation" itself was coined by physician and philosopher,  Aurelio Aureliano (1720-1780).  The suffix "-ator" is a common agent noun suffix in English, denoting a person who performs a specific action.
