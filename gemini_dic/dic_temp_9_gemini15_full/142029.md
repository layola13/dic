organogen:/ɔːrˈdʒænədʒən/| n. |器官发生; 器官发生物|The process by which organs are formed during embryonic development.  It involves the coordinated growth and differentiation of cells and tissues to create functional organs.  Organogens are substances that promote organogenesis. |Example:  The study of organogenesis is crucial to understanding birth defects.|近义词：organ former, morphogen|反义词：organolysis
