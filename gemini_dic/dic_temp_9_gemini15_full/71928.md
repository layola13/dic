词源:

The word "flibustier" originates from the French word "flibustier," which itself is derived from the Dutch word "vrijbuiter," meaning "freebooter."  Freebooters were adventurers who operated outside the law, often engaging in piracy or privateering. The French adopted the term, and it eventually made its way into English.  The spelling and pronunciation have evolved over time, reflecting the linguistic influences involved.
