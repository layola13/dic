词源:
The word "jogtrotting" is a compound word combining "jog" and "trotting."  "Jog" in this context comes from the Old Norse word "jǫkka," meaning "to shake" or "to jolt." "Trotting" is from the Old French word "trotter," from the Latin "trottus," meaning "a running pace" or "a trot."  Therefore, jogtrotting describes a slow, steady, shaking or jolting sort of trot.
