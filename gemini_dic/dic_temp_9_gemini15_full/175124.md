词源:

The word "raffle" ultimately derives from the Middle Dutch word *raffel*, meaning "a kind of game".  This term likely developed from a combination of words relating to chance or gambling. The exact etymological path is complex and not fully resolved but links to similar words in other Germanic languages are evident.
