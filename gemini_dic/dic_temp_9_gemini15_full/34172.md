词源:  The word "clammy" ultimately derives from the Old English word "clām," meaning "sticky" or "glue."  Over time, this evolved into the Middle English word "clammy," retaining its core meaning of stickiness and often implying a cold or unpleasant wetness. The "-iest" suffix indicates the superlative degree, meaning "most clammy."
