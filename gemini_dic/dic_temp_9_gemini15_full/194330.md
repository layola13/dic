词源:  The word is a compound of "self" and "pitiful."  "Self" is an Old English word meaning "oneself," and "pitiful" derives from "pity" (Old French "pitié," from Latin "pietas," meaning "dutifulness, piety, reverence") + "-ful" (a suffix meaning "full of").  Thus, "self-pitiful" literally means "full of pity for oneself."
