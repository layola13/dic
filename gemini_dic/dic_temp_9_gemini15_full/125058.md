The word "muli" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a word from another language:  If it's from another language, please specify the language so I can help translate and provide information.
* It's a proper noun or a neologism:  If it's a proper noun (like a place name or person's name), or a newly coined word, more context is needed.

Please provide more information or the correct spelling so I can assist you.
