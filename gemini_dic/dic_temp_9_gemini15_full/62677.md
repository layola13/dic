The word "enged" is not a recognized word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or looking word?

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, a slang term within a specific community, or an abbreviation not widely known.  If this is the case, providing more context (where you encountered the word) would be helpful.

3. **It's a technical term:** It could be a term used in a specialized field (e.g., a technical jargon, a scientific term).  Again, more context is needed.


Without knowing the correct spelling or intended word, I cannot provide the requested information including pronunciation, parts of speech, meaning, examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc.  Please provide more information or the correct spelling.
