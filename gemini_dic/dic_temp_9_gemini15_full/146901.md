词源:

The word is formed from:

* **over-**:  prefix indicating excess or to a great degree.
* **insolent**: adjective meaning rude and arrogant.  It originates from the Old French word *insolent*, from Latin *insolēns*, meaning "unusual," "extraordinary,"  "insolent," from *in-*, "not," + *solēns*, present participle of *solēre*, "to be accustomed," "to be wont."  The sense shift from "unusual" to "rude" is due to the implication of unusual lack of respect.

Therefore, "overinsolently" means to act with an excessive degree of insolence, exceeding the normal bounds of rudeness and arrogance.
