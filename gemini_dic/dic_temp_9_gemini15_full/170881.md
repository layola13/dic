pseudoisometric: /ˌsuːdoʊˌaɪsoʊˈmɛtrɪk/ | adj. | 伪等轴测的 |  Approximating isometric projection;  a visual representation that resembles an isometric projection but is not perfectly accurate in terms of angles and proportions. It often uses a simpler, less precise method to achieve a similar three-dimensional effect.  | Example:  The game uses a pseudoisometric perspective to create a three-dimensional look while maintaining ease of development.  游戏使用伪等轴测视角来营造三维效果，同时保持开发的简易性。|近义词：near-isometric, quasi-isometric | 反义词：true isometric, orthographic |
