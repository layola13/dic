Etymology:

From Latin *glossa, from Greek γλῶσσα (glôssa) "tongue, language".  The sense shift from "tongue" to "commentary" is due to early practice of writing marginal notes and translations in the margins of texts, often in a different language.  The visual resemblance of these notes to a "tongue" sticking out from the main text may have contributed to this semantic evolution.


USAGE->

This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations or tense changes in the same way as a verb like "to be" or "to go".  The usage depends on the specific context (linguistic gloss, glossary, or anatomical tongue).  Examples of usage in sentences illustrating different grammatical structures:

Singular Noun:

The glossa in the manuscript was written in a different hand. = 手稿中的注释是用不同的笔迹写的。

PHRASE->
