词源:

The word "removal" comes from the Old French word "remueal," meaning "the act of removing."  This further derives from the verb "remuer," meaning "to move, stir, or agitate."  The prefix "re-" indicates "again" or "back," implying a process of taking something away or putting it back in its original state (although in practice it doesn't usually mean "returning" something).  The suffix "-al" denotes a noun of action or process.
