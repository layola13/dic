The word "pusing" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a regional dialect word, or a newly coined term.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need clarification on the intended word.  Is it a misspelling of another word?  Could you provide context where you encountered this word?
