It highlights not just wealth but an extreme or excessive degree of it. | The overrichnesses of the elite were starkly contrasted with the poverty of the masses.  =  精英阶层的极度富有与大众的贫困形成了鲜明对比。  The family's overrichnesses allowed them to indulge in extravagant lifestyles. =  这个家庭的巨额财富使他们能够过上奢侈的生活。 | opulence, affluence, luxury | poverty, destitution, impecuniosity


USAGE->

This word, being uncommon, doesn't lend itself to typical grammatical tense examples in the same way as common words.  Its usage is primarily descriptive, found in sentences focusing on the noun itself.  Therefore, tense demonstrations are less relevant.

PHRASE->

Because "overrichnesses" is a rare word,  standard phrasal combinations don't exist.  Phrases would need to be constructed around the concept of excessive wealth, not the word itself.  Examples:

signs of overrichnesses = 过度富裕的迹象
display of overrichnesses =  炫耀财富
the consequences of overrichnesses = 过度富裕的后果
burden of overrichnesses =  巨富的负担
excess of overrichnesses = 财富的极度过剩
