The word "shtook" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a slang term, a regional dialect word, or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (e.g., a book, a conversation, online)
* **What was the surrounding text or conversation?** This will help to understand the intended meaning.


If you can provide this context, I may be able to offer a possible interpretation or suggest similar-sounding words with their analyses.
