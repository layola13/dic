词源:
The word "charm" comes from the Old French word "charme," meaning "song," "spell," or "incantation." This ultimately derives from the Latin word "carmen," also meaning "song" or "spell."  The connection lies in the power of song or incantation to enchant or influence, mirroring the captivating power attributed to charm.  The modern sense of "a trinket" developed later, reflecting the use of small objects as amulets or talismans.
