USAGE->
This word is primarily used in describing the behavior of electrical components.  Therefore, tense conjugation examples are not applicable in the same way as with a verb.  Instead, examples will show usage in different contexts.


Example 1 (Simple Statement): The circuit showed ohmic behavior.  电路表现出欧姆特性。

Example 2 (Comparative Statement):  This material exhibits more ohmic behavior than that one at high temperatures.  这种材料在高温下比那种材料表现出更明显的欧姆特性。

Example 3 (Negative Statement): The diode did not behave ohmically.  二极管没有表现出欧姆特性。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "ohmically".  The word is highly technical and used in specific contexts within electronics and physics.
