germiparity:/ˌdʒɜːrmɪˈpærɪti/| n. |胚胎发生；胎生|The process of producing offspring from a fertilized egg that develops within the body of the parent, resulting in live birth.  This is in contrast to oviparity (egg-laying).|Example:  Germiparity is the reproductive strategy employed by mammals.|近义词：viviparity, ovoviviparity|反义词：oviparity

PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "germiparity."  The term is primarily used in a scientific context.  Phrases using related concepts would be more appropriate.  For example,  "mode of reproduction," "reproductive strategy," "live birth," etc. could be used in place of germiparity in different contexts.
