词源:
Descendants comes from the Old French word *descendants*, which itself derives from the Latin verb *descendĕre*, meaning "to climb down," "to come down," or "to descend."  The sense of lineage and ancestry evolved from the idea of descendants "coming down" from their ancestors through generations.
