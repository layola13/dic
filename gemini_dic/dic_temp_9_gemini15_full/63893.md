The epineurium is the outermost layer of connective tissue surrounding a nerve.  | Example:  The injury caused epineural damage, resulting in nerve dysfunction.  神经损伤造成了神经外膜损伤，导致神经功能障碍。 | 近义词: perineural (有时，取决于上下文) | 反义词: intraneural (位于神经内部的)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The epineurium protects the nerves. = 神经外膜保护神经。

将来时:
Future research will focus on epineural repair techniques. = 未来的研究将集中在神经外膜修复技术上。
We will assess the epineural response to the treatment. = 我们将评估神经外膜对治疗的反应。

虚拟语气:
If the epineurium were intact, nerve function would be preserved. = 如果神经外膜完整，神经功能就能得到保留。
