词源:

The word "canonlike" is a compound word. It combines "canon" and "-like".

"Canon" originates from the Greek word "kanōn," meaning "straight rod," "rule," or "standard."  In the religious context, it came to refer to a body of accepted books (the Bible) or a list of saints recognized by the Church. This meaning then broadened to include any established code, rule, or standard.

"-like" is a suffix indicating resemblance or similarity.


用法说明:

"Canonlike" is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that resembles or conforms to a canon or established standard.  It suggests a certain formality, adherence to rules, and often a sense of tradition.  The implication can be positive (suggesting high quality, reliability) or negative (suggesting rigidity or lack of flexibility).
