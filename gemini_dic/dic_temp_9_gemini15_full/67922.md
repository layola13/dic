USAGE->
This word is relatively uncommon and doesn't readily lend itself to common grammatical structures like the examples provided for "what".  The grammatical usage depends entirely on the sentence structure in which it's used.  It would typically be used in a sentence with a form of the verb "to be," often in a descriptive or existential sense.

Example sentences illustrating different tenses:

Simple Present: The facelessnesses of the system are disheartening. (系统缺乏个性令人沮丧。)
Simple Past: The facelessnesses of the corporation were evident in its cold, impersonal policies. (公司的缺乏个性在其冷漠、没有人情味的政策中显而易见。)
Present Perfect: The facelessnesses of online interactions have led to increased social isolation. (网络互动中缺乏个性导致了社会孤立的加剧。)

PHRASE->
Because "facelessnesses" is a relatively rare word,  it doesn't have commonly used set phrases in the same way as common words like "what".  Phrases would be context-dependent and created as needed.
