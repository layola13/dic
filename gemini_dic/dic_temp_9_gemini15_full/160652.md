词源:
From "porter" (a person who carries burdens, a doorkeeper) + "-ess" (feminine suffix).  The word "porter" itself has origins in Old French "portour," meaning "carrier," ultimately from Latin "portare," meaning "to carry."  The "-ess" suffix is a common way to create feminine forms of nouns in English.
