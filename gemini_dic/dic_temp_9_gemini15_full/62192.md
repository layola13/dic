词源:
From French *encore*, meaning "again", "once more", or "yet".  It ultimately derives from the Old French *ancora*, which came from the Latin *hanc horam* ("at this hour").  The shift in meaning from "at this hour" to "again" likely occurred through a process of semantic change over time, where the phrase came to be used to indicate a repetition or continuation.
