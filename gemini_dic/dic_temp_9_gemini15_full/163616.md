The word "predarker" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or fictional context.

To provide helpful information, we need to consider possibilities:

**Possibility 1: Misspelling**

It might be a misspelling of words like:

* **Pre-darker:** This would imply "before it gets darker," but is still grammatically awkward.  It could be used descriptively, but would need more context.

* **Darker:** This is a standard adjective meaning "more dark."


**Possibility 2: Neologism/Fictional Word**

If it's a newly coined word or one from a specific work of fiction, we'd need the source to understand its meaning and usage.


To help me give you a proper analysis, please provide:

* **Context:** Where did you encounter this word?  A sentence, a book title, a website, etc.
* **Intended meaning:** What do you think the word means?


Once I have this information, I can offer a more accurate and complete analysis.
