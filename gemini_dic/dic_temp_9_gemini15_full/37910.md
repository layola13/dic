complementary-angles:/ˌkɒmplɪˈmentəri ˈæŋɡəlz/| n. |余角|Two angles are complementary if their sum is 90 degrees.  Complementary angles are often used in geometry problems to find missing angles or to prove geometric relationships. For example, if one angle in a right-angled triangle is 30 degrees, its complementary angle is 60 degrees.|Example: The angles 30° and 60° are complementary angles because 30° + 60° = 90°.  The angles x and (90-x) are complementary angles.|近义词: supplementary angles (if the sum is 180 degrees)|反义词: supplementary angles


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Angles A and B are complementary. = 角A和角B互为余角。
These two angles are complementary. = 这两个角互为余角。


一般过去时:
The angles were complementary. = 这些角互为余角。
We found that the angles were complementary. = 我们发现这些角互为余角。


现在完成时:
We have found several pairs of complementary angles. = 我们已经找到了几对余角。
They have determined that the angles are complementary. = 他们已经确定这些角互为余角。


过去完成时:
Before the calculation, we had assumed the angles were complementary. = 计算之前，我们假设这些角互为余角。
They had already known that the angles were complementary. = 他们之前就已经知道这些角互为余角。


将来时:
The angles will be complementary. = 这些角将互为余角。
We will prove that the angles will be complementary. = 我们将证明这些角将互为余角。


虚拟语气:
If the angles were complementary, the proof would be complete. = 如果这些角互为余角，证明就完成了。
I wish I had known the angles were complementary earlier. = 我希望我早点知道这些角互为余角。


被动语态:

否定句:
The angles are not complementary. = 这些角不是互为余角。
These angles are not complementary; their sum is greater than 90 degrees. = 这些角不是互为余角；它们的和大于90度。


PHRASE->
