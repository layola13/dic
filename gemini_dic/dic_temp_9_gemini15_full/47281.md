词源:

The word "de-democratized" is formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse") to the word "democratized," which itself is the past participle of the verb "to democratize."  "Democratize" comes from "democracy," ultimately derived from Ancient Greek δημοκρατία (dēmokratía), combining  δῆμος (dēmos) "people" and  κράτος (kratos) "power" or "rule". Therefore, "de-democratized" literally means "removed from democracy" or "having had democracy removed."
