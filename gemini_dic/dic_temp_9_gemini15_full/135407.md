词源:
The word "nonperpendicular" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "perpendicular" (meaning "at right angles").  "Perpendicular" itself derives from the Latin word "perpendicularis," which ultimately comes from the Latin words "perpendiculum" (a plumb line) and "pendere" (to hang).  The original sense related to something hanging straight down, hence the connection to right angles.
