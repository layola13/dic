The word "ggantija" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a misspelling or a word from another language, likely Maltese.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full etymological analysis, pronunciation, or grammatical information in the requested format.  To help me assist you, please provide the correct spelling and language of origin.
