It is the last period of the Paleozoic Era. The Permian is named after Perm, Russia, where rocks from this period were first studied. The Permian Period is known for its significant evolutionary changes and the massive Permian-Triassic extinction event, which wiped out a large percentage of life on Earth. | The Permian extinction event was a catastrophic event that significantly reshaped life on Earth. |近义词：Paleozoic Era (a broader term) |反义词：Triassic (the following period)
