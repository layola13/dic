词源:

The word "regratiatory" comes from the Latin word "gratia," meaning "favor," "grace," or "thankfulness."  The prefix "re-" intensifies the meaning, and the suffix "-tory" indicates an adjective. The word evolved through the Middle English "gratiat" and then to its modern form.  The original sense highlighted a return of favour or gratefulness, but the modern usage often carries a more negative connotation, suggesting insincere flattery.
