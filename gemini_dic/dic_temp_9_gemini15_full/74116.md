词源:
The word "foul" meaning "dirty, unclean, or unpleasant" has Old English roots.  The addition of "up" creates a phrasal verb emphasizing the complete and utter nature of the mess or failure.  The development of "foul-up" as a noun reflects the common linguistic process of verbal phrases becoming nouns.
