pretransmissions: /ˌpriːtrænzˈmɪʃənz/ | n. | 预先传输；预先传送 | The study of pretransmissions focuses on the processes and techniques involved in sending information or data before the main transmission occurs.  This often involves preparation, scheduling, and ensuring the integrity of the data before it's sent. | Example:  The pretransmissions for the live broadcast involved rigorous testing of all equipment and communication lines. = 直播的预先传输包括对所有设备和通信线路进行严格的测试。|近义词: advance transmissions, preparatory transmissions |反义词: post-transmissions

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The system performs pretransmissions before each data transfer. = 系统在每次数据传输之前执行预先传输。
Pretransmissions ensure data integrity. = 预先传输确保数据完整性。


一般过去时:
The engineers completed the pretransmissions successfully. = 工程师们成功地完成了预先传输。
Pretransmissions were tested thoroughly before the launch. = 在发射之前对预先传输进行了彻底的测试。


现在完成时:
They have completed all the necessary pretransmissions. = 他们已经完成了所有必要的预先传输。
We have successfully implemented improved pretransmissions protocols. = 我们已经成功地实施了改进的预先传输协议。


过去完成时:
The data had already been prepared for pretransmissions. = 数据已经准备好进行预先传输了。
Before the main transmission, they had finished all the pretransmissions. = 在主要传输之前，他们已经完成了所有的预先传输。


将来时:
We will conduct pretransmissions at 8:00 AM tomorrow. = 我们将在明天上午8:00进行预先传输。
The team will perform extensive pretransmissions checks before the event. = 该团队将在活动前进行广泛的预先传输检查。


虚拟语气:
If we had better pretransmissions, we would have fewer errors. = 如果我们有更好的预先传输，我们的错误就会更少。
It would be ideal if all pretransmissions were automated. = 如果所有的预先传输都能自动化，那就最理想了。


被动语态:
Pretransmissions were conducted by the technical team. = 预先传输是由技术团队进行的。
The pretransmissions are being monitored constantly. = 预先传输正在不断被监控。


疑问句:
Were the pretransmissions successful? = 预先传输成功了吗？
Have the pretransmissions been completed? = 预先传输已经完成了吗？


否定句:
The pretransmissions were not completed on time. = 预先传输没有按时完成。
We did not perform the necessary pretransmissions. = 我们没有进行必要的预先传输。



PHRASE->
pretransmission checks = 预先传输检查
