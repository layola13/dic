The word "shonas" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible. It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Perhaps a proper noun (a person's name, a place name)?  Providing more context would be helpful.

2. **It's a proper noun (name):**  It might be a name of a person, place, or thing.  Without more context, we cannot determine its meaning or usage.

3. **It's slang or jargon:** It might be a word used within a specific community or context that isn't widely known.

4. **It's a newly coined word:** It's possible the word is very new and hasn't yet been included in dictionaries.


To help me provide the analysis you requested, please:

* **Provide more context:** Where did you encounter this word?  What was the surrounding text or conversation?
* **Confirm the spelling:**  Are you absolutely sure of the spelling?  Even a slight change could make a difference.


Once you provide additional information, I can attempt a more accurate analysis.
