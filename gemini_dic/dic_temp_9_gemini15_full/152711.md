pearlite:/ˈpɜːrlaɪt/| n. |珠光体|A fine-grained, layered microstructure found in steel and cast iron, consisting of alternating layers of ferrite and cementite.  It is relatively soft and ductile.| 例句：The microstructure of the steel showed a high percentage of pearlite. 这块钢的显微结构显示出高比例的珠光体。

The slow cooling of austenite results in the formation of pearlite. 奥氏体的缓慢冷却导致珠光体的形成。|近义词：lamellar structure (层状结构)|反义词：martensite (马氏体)


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Pearlite is a common microstructure in steel. = 珠光体是钢中常见的显微组织。
The material contains a significant amount of pearlite. =这种材料含有大量的珠光体。


一般过去时:
The pearlite transformed during the heat treatment. = 珠光体在热处理过程中发生了转变。
We observed pearlite in the microscopic analysis. = 我们在显微分析中观察到了珠光体。


现在完成时:

Researchers have determined the formation mechanism of pearlite. = 研究人员已经确定了珠光体的形成机制。


过去完成时:
Before the heat treatment, the steel contained mostly austenite. = 热处理前，钢主要含有奥氏体。
The pearlite had already formed before the quenching process began. = 在淬火过程开始之前，珠光体已经形成了。


将来时:
The engineers will analyze the pearlite content in the sample. = 工程师们将分析样品中的珠光体含量。
We will determine the mechanical properties of the pearlite structure. = 我们将确定珠光体结构的力学性能。


虚拟语气:
If the cooling rate were slower, more pearlite would form. = 如果冷却速度更慢，就会形成更多的珠光体。
It would be beneficial if we could control the pearlite transformation precisely. = 如果我们可以精确地控制珠光体的转变，那将是有益的。


被动语态:
The pearlite content was determined using microscopy. = 珠光体含量是用显微镜测定的。

疑问句:
What is the percentage of pearlite in this steel? = 这块钢中珠光体的百分比是多少？
How does the cooling rate affect the formation of pearlite? = 冷却速度如何影响珠光体的形成？


否定句:
This steel does not contain any pearlite. = 这块钢不含任何珠光体。
The sample did not show a significant amount of pearlite. = 样品没有显示出大量的珠光体。


PHRASE->
