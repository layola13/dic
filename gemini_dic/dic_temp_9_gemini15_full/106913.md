词源:
The word "lacers" is the plural form of "lacer," which is ultimately derived from the Latin word "lacinia," meaning "a flap, a lobe, a piece." This reflects the thin, strip-like nature of the material.  The association with "lacing" (the act of fastening)  further solidified its meaning over time.
