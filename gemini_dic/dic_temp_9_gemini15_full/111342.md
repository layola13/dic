词源:
The word "livelihood" is a compound word.  It combines "live" (meaning to exist or be alive) and "lihood" (an older word related to "like" and signifying "state," "condition," or "manner").  Therefore, "livelihood" originally meant the "state or manner of living."  The "-hood" suffix is common in English, forming nouns from adjectives or verbs, indicating state, condition, or quality.
