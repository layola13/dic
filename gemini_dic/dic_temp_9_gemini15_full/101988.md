isochromatic:/ˌaɪsoʊkrəˈmætɪk/| adj. | 等色的；同色的 | Having the same color throughout; exhibiting only one color.  The term often refers to lines or bands of equal color saturation or hue on a map or chart, typically representing areas of equal value in a specific characteristic (e.g., equal elevation, equal stress). | Example:  The isochromatic lines on the map showed areas of equal rainfall.  地图上的等色线显示了降雨量相同的区域。 |近义词：monochromatic, uniform in color |反义词：polychromatic, multicolored
