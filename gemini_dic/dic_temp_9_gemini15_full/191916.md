词源:
The word "sconce" ultimately derives from the Old French word "esconce," which meant "hidden place, shelter, or refuge."  Over time, the word evolved to describe a wall bracket used to hold a candle or other light source, likely because such brackets often provided a sheltered, protected place for the flame.
