The word "konate" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to help you find the correct spelling.
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It could be a newly coined word, a term used within a specific community or field, or slang.  Again, context is crucial.
* **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.  Please specify the language if this is the case.
