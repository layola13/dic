词源:
The word "evade" comes from the Old French word "evader," which means "to escape."  "Evader" itself is derived from the Latin word "evadere," which is composed of the prefix "e-" (out) and the verb "vadere" (to go).  Therefore, the original meaning points directly to the act of "going out" or "getting away."
