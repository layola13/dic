USAGE->
(Hyponyms themselves don't have a typical usage in the way a verb or noun does.  The usage applies to how they are used *within* a sentence or to describe a relationship between words.)


PHRASE->
(Hyponyms are not used in phrases in the same way as common words. The usage relates to their hierarchical relationship with hypernyms.)

词源:
The term "hyponym" is derived from Greek roots:

* **hypo-**:  meaning "under" or "beneath"
* **-onym**: referring to a name or term

Therefore, a hyponym is literally a "name under" another name – a more specific term under a more general one.
