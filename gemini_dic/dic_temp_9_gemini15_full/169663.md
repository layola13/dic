词源:

The word "proportionately" derives from the word "proportion," which comes from the Old French word "proporcion," ultimately from the Latin word "proportio," meaning "comparison," "similarity," or "due share." The suffix "-ately" is an adverbial suffix indicating manner or condition.  Therefore, "proportionately" signifies "in a manner that is proportional."
