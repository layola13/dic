词源:
The word "hardenability" is derived from the verb "harden" (to make or become hard) and the suffix "-ability," indicating capacity or potential.  The suffix "-ability" comes from the Latin suffix "-abilitas," which signifies "the quality of being able to".  Therefore, "hardenability" literally means "the ability to be hardened".
