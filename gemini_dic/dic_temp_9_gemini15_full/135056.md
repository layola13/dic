The word "nonnormalnesses" is a noun. It's not a commonly used word and appears primarily in specialized contexts, particularly in statistics and related fields.


**Word Origin:**

The word is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "normalities," which in turn derives from "normal" + "-ity" (a suffix forming nouns of state or quality).  Therefore, it indicates a lack or absence of normality or the presence of deviations from a normal state or distribution.


**Usage:**

This word is used to describe the instances or states where something deviates from a standard, expected, or typical pattern.  It's most frequently found in statistical analysis when referring to data that doesn't follow a normal distribution (like a bell curve).  In other contexts, it could describe unusual or atypical situations or behaviors.



**Example Sentences:**

*The researcher investigated the nonnormalnesses in the sample distribution.* 研究人员调查了样本分布中的非正态性。

*The presence of outliers contributed to the observed nonnormalnesses.*  异常值的存在导致了观察到的非正态性。


The grammatical usage of "nonnormalnesses" is straightforward as a plural noun. It can be the subject, object, or complement of a sentence.  It does not have verb forms, as it is a noun. There are no specific tenses to consider.  Since it's a noun, it doesn't have active or passive voice.  The word itself is a statement of a state of being rather than an action.



**Phrases:**

Because "nonnormalnesses" is a highly specialized term, common phrases using it are limited to academic or technical writing.  It's typically used within the context of statistical analysis or similar fields without forming common phrases in the way that general words do.  For example, you might see phrases like: "analysis of nonnormalnesses," "detection of nonnormalnesses," or "effects of nonnormalnesses."
