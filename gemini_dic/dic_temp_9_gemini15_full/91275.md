hydrogenous: /ˌhaɪˈdrɒdʒənəs/| adj. |含氢的，由氢生成的|Of, relating to, or derived from hydrogen.  Hydrogenous sediments are formed from materials precipitated from water. |例句：The researchers analyzed the hydrogenous manganese nodules found on the ocean floor. 研究人员分析了在海底发现的氢成锰结核。  The hydrogenous origin of the mineral was confirmed by isotopic analysis.  该矿物的氢成起源通过同位素分析得到证实。|近义词：hydrogenic |反义词：non-hydrogenous


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The water is hydrogenous. = 水是含氢的。
This mineral is hydrogenous in origin. = 这种矿物起源于氢。

一般过去时:
The sample was hydrogenous. = 样本是含氢的。
Scientists determined that the sediment was hydrogenous. = 科学家确定沉积物是氢成生的。

现在完成时:
They have discovered a new hydrogenous mineral. = 他们发现了一种新的含氢矿物。
Researchers have confirmed the hydrogenous nature of the deposit. = 研究人员证实了矿床的氢成性质。

过去完成时:
Geologists had already identified the deposit as hydrogenous. = 地质学家们早已确定该矿床为氢成矿床。
Scientists had hypothesized that the rock formation was hydrogenous. = 科学家们曾假设该岩层是氢成生的。

将来时:
Future research will explore the hydrogenous processes in more detail. = 未来的研究将更详细地探讨氢成过程。
We will analyze the sample to determine if it is hydrogenous. = 我们将分析样本来确定它是否含氢。

虚拟语气:
If the sample were hydrogenous, it would contain significant amounts of deuterium.  = 如果样品是氢成生的，它将含有大量的氘。
It is crucial that we understand the hydrogenous mechanisms involved. = 了解所涉及的氢成机制至关重要。


被动语态:
The hydrogenous origin of the material was questioned by some scientists. = 一些科学家对该物质的氢成起源提出了质疑。
The samples were analyzed to determine their hydrogenous content. = 对样品进行了分析以确定其氢含量。


疑问句:
Is this sediment of hydrogenous origin? = 这沉积物是氢成起源的吗？
Are these minerals hydrogenous or hydrothermal? = 这些矿物是氢成矿还是热液矿？


否定句:
The rock formation is not hydrogenous. = 该岩层并非氢成生的。
The analysis showed that the sample was not primarily hydrogenous. = 分析表明，该样品并非主要由氢生成。


PHRASE->
hydrogenous sediments  氢成沉积物
hydrogenous manganese nodules 氢成锰结核
hydrogenous origin 氢成起源
hydrogenous mineral  氢成矿物
