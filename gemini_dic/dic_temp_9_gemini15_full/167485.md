词源:
The word "preventure" is a relatively rare word, not widely found in standard dictionaries.  It's likely a blend of "prevent" and  "-ure" (a suffix forming nouns denoting action or process).  Its usage reflects a proactive approach to risk management, emphasizing actions taken *before* a problem arises.  The lack of widespread usage suggests it might be a neologism or a less common variation.
