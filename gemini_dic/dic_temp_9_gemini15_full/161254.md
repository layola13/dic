postmeiotic: /ˌpoʊstmaɪˈɒtɪk/ | adj. | 减数分裂后的；减数分裂后期 | Postmeiotic refers to the stage of development following meiosis, the type of cell division that reduces the number of chromosomes in half, resulting in gametes (sex cells).  It describes events, processes, or structures that occur after meiosis is complete. | Example: Postmeiotic segregation of chromosomes can lead to genetic diversity in offspring.  减数分裂后染色体的分离会导致后代的遗传多样性。  The postmeiotic development of sperm cells involves significant morphological changes. 精子的减数分裂后发育涉及显著的形态变化。 |近义词: post-meiotic | 反义词: premeiotic
