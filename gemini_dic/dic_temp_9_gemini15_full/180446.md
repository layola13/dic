The word "regardless" does not follow the requested format exactly, as it's an adverb, not a noun, verb, or adjective that can be conjugated through tenses.  It doesn't have a direct opposite in the same way "good" and "bad" do.  I will adapt the format to best suit this word.


regardless: /rɪˈɡɑːrdləs/ | adv. | 不管怎样；无论如何 | Regardless of the weather, we will go for a walk.  | 近义词：irrespective of, notwithstanding, in spite of | 反义词:  (no direct opposite, but contextually opposed concepts could include  "considering," "depending on")


英文解析:  Regardless is an adverb that means "in spite of everything; without paying attention to." It indicates that something happens or is true despite other circumstances. It's often used to introduce a clause that contrasts with the main clause.

例句:

He went ahead regardless of the risks.  = 不管风险，他还是继续前进。

Regardless of her age, she was still very active. = 不管年纪多大，她仍然非常活跃。


PHRASE->

regardless of = 不管...; 无论...
without regard to = 不顾；不考虑
despite everything = 尽管一切
in any case = 无论如何
come what may = 无论发生什么


词源:

The word "regardless" comes from the Old English "un-," meaning "not," and "regard," meaning "to pay attention to" or "to consider."  The "less" suffix adds a sense of diminution, making the whole word mean "without regard."  It evolved through Middle English and early Modern English to its current form.
