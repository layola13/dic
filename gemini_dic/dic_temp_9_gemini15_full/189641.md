The word "sallenders" does not appear to be a valid word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:** Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?  Providing context (where you encountered this word) would help.

2. **It's a dialect word or slang:** It might be a regionalism or slang term not widely known.

3. **It's a newly coined word or a proper noun:**  It could be a neologism (newly invented word) or a name (possibly of a person, place, or thing).

4. **It's a made-up word:** It could be entirely fictional.
