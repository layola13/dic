词源:
The word "probability" comes from the Middle French word "probabilité,"  which in turn derives from the Latin word "probabilis," meaning "provable," "likely," or "plausible."  The root is "probare," meaning "to prove" or "to test."  The concept of probability as a mathematical field developed much later, primarily in the 17th century.
