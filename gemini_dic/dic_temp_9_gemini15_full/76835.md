The word "ganed" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a word from a very specialized or obscure context.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  If you could provide more context (sentence, paragraph, field of study where you encountered this word), I may be able to offer a more helpful response.  It may be a typo of a similar-sounding word, or a neologism (newly coined word).
