coherer:/koʊˈhɪərər/| n. |相干器，检波器|A coherer is an early type of radio signal detector that uses a loose contact between two conductors to detect radio waves.  The resistance of the contact changes when a radio wave passes through it, allowing the detection of the signal.  It was a crucial component in early wireless telegraphy systems.|Example:  The Marconi wireless system relied heavily on the coherer to detect the faint radio signals transmitted across distances.|近义词：detector (in this context)|反义词：None specifically, but terms implying advanced detection technology could be considered opposites.|名词
