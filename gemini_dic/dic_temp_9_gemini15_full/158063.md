plasmin:/ˈplæzmɪn/| n. |纤溶酶|A proteolytic enzyme (a serine protease) that dissolves blood clots.  It is formed from plasminogen by the action of activators such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). Plasmin plays a crucial role in the breakdown of fibrin, a protein that forms the meshwork of blood clots.  Its activity is tightly regulated to prevent excessive clot breakdown and bleeding.|例句：Plasmin is essential for the proper functioning of the fibrinolytic system. 纤溶酶对于纤维蛋白溶解系统的正常运作至关重要。|例句：The administration of tPA activates plasminogen to plasmin, leading to clot lysis.  施用tPA激活纤溶酶原生成纤溶酶，从而导致血凝块溶解。|近义词：fibrinolytic enzyme|反义词：thrombin
