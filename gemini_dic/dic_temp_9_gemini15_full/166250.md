prerealized:/ˌpriːˈriːəlaɪzd/ | adj. | 预先实现的，预先意识到的 |  This word is not a standard English word and lacks established dictionary entries.  It's likely a newly coined word or a misspelling.  It seems to combine "pre-" (before) and "realized" (understood or achieved).  Therefore, a plausible definition would be something that has been achieved or understood before it was expected. | Example: The prerealized benefits of the project were surprising to the team. (这个项目的预先实现的效益让团队感到惊讶。) | 近义词:  anticipated, foreseen, preempted | 反义词: unforeseen, unexpected, unanticipated |  adj.
