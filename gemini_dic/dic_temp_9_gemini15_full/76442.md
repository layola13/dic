The word "gaingiving" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure field.  To provide an analysis, I would need more context about where you encountered this word.
