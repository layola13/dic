The word "manant" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
2. **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word, a word specific to a certain dialect or community, or slang not yet widely recognized.
3. **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into English.

Please provide the correct spelling or more context about where you encountered this word, and I will be happy to help.
