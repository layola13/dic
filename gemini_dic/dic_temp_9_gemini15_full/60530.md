elaidin: /ˈɛleɪdɪn/| n. |油酸型硬脂酸甘油酯；反油酸|A solid, white, crystalline isomer of olein, a triglyceride composed of three molecules of elaidic acid (trans-9-octadecenoic acid) esterified to a glycerol molecule.| Elaidin is a triglyceride found in some fats and oils. It is an isomer of olein, differing only in the configuration of the double bond in the fatty acid chains. It's a solid at room temperature. |近义词：isomer of olein|反义词：olein
