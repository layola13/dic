parsec:/ˈpɑːrsɛk/| n. |秒差距|A parsec is a unit of astronomical distance equal to about 3.26 light-years (3.086 × 10^13 kilometers). It is based on the parallax method of measuring stellar distances.|Example:  The star is about 10 parsecs away from Earth. 这颗恒星距离地球大约10秒差距。|近义词：lightyear|反义词：N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The star system is 5 parsecs away. = 这星系距离5秒差距。
Astronomers use parsecs to measure distances. = 天文学家使用秒差距来测量距离。


一般过去时:
They calculated the distance in parsecs. = 他们计算了以秒差距为单位的距离。
The parallax method was used to determine the distance in parsecs. = 使用视差法来确定以秒差距为单位的距离。


现在完成时:
Scientists have measured many distances in parsecs. = 科学家已经用秒差距测量了许多距离。
We have learned a lot about the universe by measuring parsecs. = 通过测量秒差距，我们对宇宙有了很多了解。


过去完成时:
Before the invention of parallax, astronomers hadn't measured distances in parsecs. = 在视差法发明之前，天文学家没有用秒差距测量距离。
They had already calculated the distance in parsecs before the conference. = 他们在会议之前就已经计算出了以秒差距为单位的距离。


将来时:
We will measure the distance of that galaxy in parsecs. = 我们将用秒差距测量那个星系的距离。
Astronomers will use more advanced techniques to measure parsecs in the future. = 未来，天文学家将使用更先进的技术来测量秒差距。


虚拟语气:
If we had a more powerful telescope, we could measure parsecs more accurately. = 如果我们有一个更强大的望远镜，我们就能更精确地测量秒差距。
I wish we knew the exact distance in parsecs. = 我希望我们知道确切的秒差距距离。


被动语态:
The distance was calculated in parsecs. = 距离是用秒差距计算的。
The parsec measurement is often used in astronomy. = 秒差距测量经常用于天文学。


疑问句:
What is the distance to that star in parsecs? = 那颗星距离地球多少秒差距？
How many parsecs away is the Andromeda galaxy? = 仙女座星系距离我们多少秒差距？


否定句:
That star is not within 10 parsecs of Earth. = 那颗星不在距离地球10秒差距以内。
They did not initially measure the distance in parsecs. = 他们最初没有用秒差距测量距离。
