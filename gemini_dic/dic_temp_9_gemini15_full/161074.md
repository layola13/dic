postcyclic:/ˌpoʊstˈsaɪklɪk/| adj.|后环的；周期后的|Relating to or occurring after a cycle or series of cycles, especially in a chemical or biological process.  It often refers to events or processes that happen after a cyclical pattern has been completed.|例句：Postcyclic reactions are often less predictable than those within the main cycle.  周期后的反应通常比主循环中的反应更难以预测。|近义词：post-cyclical, subsequent, following|反义词：precyclic, antecedent


USAGE->

虚拟语气:
If the postcyclic reaction were different, the outcome would be altered. = 如果周期后反应不同，结果就会改变。
I wish we had a better understanding of postcyclic mechanisms. = 我希望我们对周期后机制有更好的了解。


被动语态:

否定句:
The reaction is not postcyclic; it's concurrent. = 该反应不是周期后的；它是同时发生的。
There were no significant postcyclic changes observed. = 没有观察到任何显著的周期后变化。
