词源:
The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessive or too much) and "brutalization" (the act of making something brutal or savagely violent).  "Brutalization" itself comes from "brutal," which has roots in the Latin word "brutus," meaning "stupid, dull, heavy, coarse."  The transition to "brutal" signifying savagery and violence occurred over time.
