词源：
The word "foreboding" comes from the Old English words "for-" (meaning "before") and "bodian" (meaning "to announce" or "to foretell").  Thus, its original meaning was literally "to announce beforehand," particularly something bad.  The modern sense of a feeling of impending doom evolved over time.
