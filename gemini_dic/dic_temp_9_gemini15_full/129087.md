nitrosalicylic: /ˌnaɪtroʊˌsælɪˈsɪlɪk/ | adj. |硝基水杨酸的|Nitro-salicylic refers to compounds containing both a nitro group (-NO2) and a salicylic acid moiety.  These compounds are derivatives of salicylic acid, where a nitro group is attached to the benzene ring.  They are often used in chemical synthesis and may exhibit various biological activities.  The exact properties depend on the position of the nitro group on the salicylic acid ring. |The synthesis of nitrosalicylic acid involves nitration of salicylic acid. This can result in different isomers depending on reaction conditions.|近义词：nitrobenzoic (if referring to the nitrobenzene component)|反义词：无
