词源:
The word "forecourt" is a compound word.  "Fore" means "in front of" or "before," and "court" in this context refers to an open area or yard, often associated with a building.  Therefore, a forecourt is literally a court that is in front of something.  The etymology of "court" itself traces back to Old French "court," meaning "short," but evolving to mean an enclosed space.
