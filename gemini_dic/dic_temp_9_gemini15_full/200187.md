The word derives from "skinflint," a noun meaning a stingy person.  "-ily" is an adverbial suffix, transforming the noun into an adverb describing how something is done.  The origin of "skinflint" itself is uncertain, but the "skinflint" is believed to be a metaphorical combination referencing the miserly nature of someone scraping off every last bit of something, much like scraping the skin off a flint stone to obtain a spark (a very meager amount).
