词源:
The word "cutlass" ultimately derives from the Old French word *coutelàs*, meaning a large knife or butcher's knife. This term evolved through Middle English and eventually settled into its modern form.  The curved blade design likely influenced its adoption by sailors and pirates for its effectiveness in close-quarters combat.
