词源:

From Middle English *marbel, from Old French marbre, from Latin marmor, from Greek mármaros.  The word's evolution reflects its use as a material (marble stone) before its use as a children's game.


用法说明:

1. As a noun referring to the toy:  This is the most common usage.  Marbles are small spheres, often made of glass, used in games.

2. As a noun referring to the stone: Marble is a metamorphic rock, used in construction and sculpture.

3. As a noun (informal):  "He's lost his marbles" means he's gone crazy or insane.  This usage is idiomatic.
