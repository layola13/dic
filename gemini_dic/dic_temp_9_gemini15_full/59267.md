The word "eador" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage description cannot be provided.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or looking word.
* **It's a neologism:** It might be a newly coined word, specific to a particular field, community, or individual.  If this is the case, more context is needed to understand its meaning.
* **It's a word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language, and without knowing the language of origin, analysis would be impossible.
