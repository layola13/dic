词源：

* **quasi-**:  Latin prefix meaning "as if," "seemingly," or "somewhat."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation but not a complete identity.

* **cheerful**:  Old English *cēarful*, from *cēaru* "care, sorrow" + *-ful* "full of."  The original meaning was "free from care," which evolved into the modern sense of "happy and lively."
