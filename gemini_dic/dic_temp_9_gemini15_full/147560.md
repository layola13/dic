The word "overpeople" does not exist as a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., according to the requested format.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a particular context or dialect.  If you encountered this word somewhere, providing the context would help determine its intended meaning.
