The word "fantique" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you intended a different word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Similar-sounding words might include "antique," "fanatic," or a proper noun.

2. **It's a neologism or newly coined word:**  In this case, providing context (where you encountered the word) is crucial to understanding its meaning and usage.

3. **It's a word from a specific dialect or jargon:**  Certain communities might use unique terminology.  Again, context is vital.

4. **It's a proper noun:** A brand name or place name.
