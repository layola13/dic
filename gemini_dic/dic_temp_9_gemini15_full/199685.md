It involves creating a vacuum at the top of the tube to draw the liquid up and over.|例句：The gardener used siphonage to empty the pond. 园丁用虹吸作用清空了池塘。

例句：Siphonage is a common method for transferring liquids between containers.虹吸作用是容器间转移液体的常用方法。


近义词：suction, drainage|反义词：None specifically, but the opposite would be methods of transferring liquid requiring energy input, such as pumping.|词性：名词
