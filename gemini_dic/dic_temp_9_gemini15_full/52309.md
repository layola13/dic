词源:
The word "dicker" ultimately derives from Middle Dutch "dikkeren," meaning "to thicken,"  or possibly a related word meaning "to make thick." The connection to bargaining is obscure but might refer to the process of slowly adding details and conditions to a deal, thus "thickening" the agreement.  The semantic shift likely occurred through a series of intermediary usages and meanings.
