The phrase's origin is unclear, but "tar" here is likely used figuratively, not literally.  "Tar" is a thick, sticky substance. The image is one of someone being beaten so badly that they are covered in (figurative) tar, representing a thorough and complete defeat.  The expression likely emerged in informal speech and slang. There's no traceable formal etymology in dictionaries.  The use of "tar" enhances the sense of a forceful and overwhelming beating.
