词源:

The word "motley" ultimately derives from the Old French word "motelé," meaning "speckled," "variegated," or "dappled."  This, in turn, likely comes from the Old French word "mote," meaning "spot" or "speck."  The shift from "motelé" to "motley" reflects the evolution of the English language, incorporating and adapting words from its French influences.
