词源:
The word "equipped" comes from the Old French word "equiper," meaning "to equip," which in turn derives from the Latin word "equipare," meaning "to make equal" or "to furnish."  The sense of providing necessary items shifted from making things equal in value or quality to providing needed items for a specific purpose.
