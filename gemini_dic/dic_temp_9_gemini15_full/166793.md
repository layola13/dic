prespecializing: /ˌpriːˈspeʃəlaɪzɪŋ/ | v. | 预先专业化；提前专门化 |  The act of specializing before a specific time or event; engaging in specialized training or preparation in advance.  This word is not a standard or commonly used word in English; it's likely a newly coined word or a very rarely used one.  Therefore, providing detailed grammatical examples and phrases is impractical.  The meaning is derived from the combination of "pre-" (before) and "specializing" (the act of specializing).
