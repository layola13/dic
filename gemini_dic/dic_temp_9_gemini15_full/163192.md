USAGE->
This word is quite specialized and doesn't naturally lend itself to typical grammatical tense usage examples as shown in your template for common words like "what".  Precompleteness is a noun describing a state, and its usage would occur within sentences that describe that state, rather than being the main verb in a sentence.  Therefore, providing examples for tenses is not appropriate here.
