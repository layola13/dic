hyponastic:/ˌhaɪpəˈnæstɪk/| adj.|下弯的，负向生长性的| relating to or characterized by epinasty, a plant growth movement where growth on the upper side of an organ is slower than that on the lower side, causing downward curvature.|The leaves of many plants exhibit hyponastic growth in response to high humidity. 许多植物的叶子对高湿度会表现出下弯生长。|近义词：epinastic (有时可互换，但hyponastic更强调下弯)|反义词：epinastic (有时可互换，但epinastic更强调上弯),  euanasty


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The leaves show hyponastic movement. = 叶子表现出下弯运动。
Hyponastic growth is common in some plants. = 一些植物普遍存在下弯生长。


一般过去时:

Researchers observed hyponastic responses. = 研究人员观察到下弯反应。


现在完成时:
The experiment has shown hyponastic effects. = 实验已经显示了下弯效应。
Scientists have documented hyponastic growth in various species. = 科学家已经记录了各种物种的下弯生长。


过去完成时:
The leaves had already undergone hyponastic bending before the treatment. = 在处理之前，叶子已经发生了下弯。
The researchers had observed hyponastic changes in the previous study. = 研究人员在前一个研究中观察到下弯变化。


将来时:
The treatment will likely induce hyponastic growth. = 处理可能会诱导下弯生长。

虚拟语气:
If the humidity were higher, the leaves would show more pronounced hyponastic curvature. = 如果湿度更高，叶子会表现出更明显的下弯曲率。
It is unlikely that the plant would exhibit hyponastic growth under these conditions. = 在这些条件下，该植物不太可能表现出下弯生长。


被动语态:
Hyponastic movement was observed in the experiment. = 在实验中观察到下弯运动。
Hyponastic growth can be induced by various factors. = 下弯生长可以由各种因素诱导。


疑问句:
Is this plant exhibiting hyponastic growth? = 这种植物是否表现出下弯生长？
What factors contribute to hyponastic curvature in this species? = 哪些因素导致该物种的下弯曲率？


否定句:
The leaves did not show significant hyponastic responses. = 叶子没有显示出明显的下弯反应。
This species does not typically exhibit hyponastic movement. = 这个物种通常不表现出下弯运动。


PHRASE->
