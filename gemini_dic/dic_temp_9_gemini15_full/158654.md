pliohippus:/ˌplaɪ.oʊˈhɪ.pəs/| n. | 漸新馬屬 |  A genus of extinct three-toed horses that lived during the Miocene epoch.  They are considered an important ancestor of modern horses, exhibiting characteristics transitional between earlier, smaller multi-toed equids and modern one-toed horses.  They were relatively large for their time, and possessed a longer face and higher crowned teeth adapted for grazing. |  The Pliohippus fossils provide valuable insights into the evolutionary history of the horse. | 近义词:  (no direct synonyms, as it refers to a specific genus) | 反义词: (no direct antonyms)
