sheol: /ˈʃiːoʊl/ | n. |阴间，地狱，死亡之地 |Sheol is a Hebrew word referring to the underworld, the abode of the dead. It is not necessarily a place of punishment, but rather a general term for the realm of the departed. In the Old Testament, Sheol is depicted as a shadowy, silent place where everyone, both good and evil, ultimately goes.  The concept of Sheol evolved over time, and its portrayal varied depending on the specific context.  Later interpretations often conflated Sheol with Hades in Greek mythology or Hell in Christian theology. | 例句：The Psalmist describes Sheol as a land of forgetfulness.  诗篇作者将阴间描述为一个遗忘之地。

The prophet Isaiah spoke of Sheol's inability to praise God. 先知以赛亚谈到阴间无法赞美上帝。
