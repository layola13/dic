词源:
The word "decitizenize" is a relatively modern coinage, formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove or deprive of") to the noun "citizenize" (to make someone a citizen).  The process reflects the growing awareness and discussion around the practice of stripping individuals of their citizenship.
