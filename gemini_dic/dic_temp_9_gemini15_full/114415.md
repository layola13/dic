词源:
The verb "make out" originally meant "to understand" or "to discern." This sense derives from the Old English "macian" (to make) + "ut" (out).  Over time, the meaning evolved to include the romantic sense of kissing, and the sense of managing or coping with something.  The sense of forging or fabricating is a more recent development.
