词源:
The word "carnival" ultimately derives from the Medieval Latin word "carnelevamen," which means "removal of flesh" or "farewell to meat."  This refers to the period before Lent, when meat consumption was traditionally avoided.  The word evolved through various forms in different languages before arriving at its modern English form.
