词源:  The word "fomenting" comes from the Old French word "fomenter," meaning "to bathe," "to foment," or "to cherish." This, in turn, is derived from the Latin word "fomentare," which also had the meaning of applying warmth or heat (as in a poultice), which then metaphorically extended to the idea of nurturing or stirring up something, particularly unrest or trouble.  The modern usage reflects this metaphorical evolution.
