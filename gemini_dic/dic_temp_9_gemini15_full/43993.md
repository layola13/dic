词源:
The word "criminalises" is derived from the word "crime," ultimately from the Old French word "crim," meaning "accusation, offense." The suffix "-al" forms the adjective "criminal," and the suffix "-ise" (or "-ize")  indicates the act of making something into something else. Therefore, "criminalises" means "to make criminal" or "to declare as a crime."
