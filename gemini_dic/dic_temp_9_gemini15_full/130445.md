词源:

The word is formed by adding the negative prefix "non-" to the noun "absolutions," which derives from the verb "absolve."  "Absolve" comes from the Latin word "absolvere," meaning "to loosen, free, acquit."  Therefore, "nonabsolutions" signifies the opposite state:  not being freed from guilt or blame.
