词源:
The word "quasi" is derived from the Latin word "quasi," meaning "as if," "almost," or "like."  "New" is an English word with Germanic origins, meaning "recently made or created."  Therefore, "quasi-new" combines the Latin prefix indicating a near approximation with the English adjective denoting a state of freshness or novelty.
