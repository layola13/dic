/ˌneɪzəlɪˈzeɪʃənz/ | n. | 鼻音化；鼻化 | The modification of a vowel sound by adding nasal resonance.  Nasalization is a common phonetic process in many languages, where the sound of a vowel is altered by lowering the velum (soft palate) and allowing air to escape through the nose.  This results in a sound that is perceived as having a "nasal" quality.  | Example: The French word "bon" exhibits nasalization of the vowel.  | 近义词： nasal resonance, nasalization of vowels | 反义词：oralization
