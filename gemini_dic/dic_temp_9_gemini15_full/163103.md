precollapsibilities:/ˌpriːkəˌlæpsəˈbɪlətiz/| n. |崩塌可能性；倒塌可能性|The word "precollapsibilities" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, formed by combining "pre-" (before), "collapse" (to fall down suddenly), and "-abilities" (the state or quality of being able).  It suggests the potential for something to collapse before a certain point or event.  The word is quite unwieldy and rarely, if ever, used in formal writing or speech. A more natural and common way to express this idea would be to use phrases like "likelihood of pre-collapse," "potential for early collapse," or "risk of imminent collapse."|The analysis of the structural precollapsibilities showed a high probability of failure. 结构预先崩塌可能性分析表明，存在很高的破坏概率。|近义词：potential for collapse, risk of collapse, likelihood of pre-collapse|反义词：stability, strength, resilience|名词
