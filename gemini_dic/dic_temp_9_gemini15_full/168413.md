The word "proappropriation" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or common usage.  It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, possibly a combination of "pro" (in favor of) and "appropriation" (the action of taking something for one's own use, typically without the owner's permission).  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  I can, however, offer an analysis of the constituent parts:


**pro:**

/proʊ/ | prefix |  赞成；支持；有利于 |  A prefix meaning "in favor of," "supporting," or "advocating." | Example: pro-choice (支持堕胎选择权的) | Near Synonyms:  for, in support of | Antonyms: anti-, against


**appropriation:**

/əˌproʊpriˈeɪʃən/ | noun | 挪用；拨款；占用 | The action of taking something for one's own use, typically without the owner's permission.  It can also refer to the act of setting aside funds for a specific purpose. | Example:  The appropriation of indigenous cultural practices is harmful. (对土著文化的挪用是有害的)   | Near Synonyms:  taking, seizure, allocation | Antonyms:  return, restoration


**Hypothetical "proappropriation":**

If "proappropriation" were to be coined and used, it would likely imply support for or advocacy of appropriation, which is generally viewed negatively in many contexts, particularly regarding cultural appropriation.  The word would be highly unusual and potentially controversial.  Its usage would need to be defined within a specific context to be understood.


**USAGE (for "appropriation" and "pro" separately, as "proappropriation" is not a word):**

**Appropriation:**

**Pro:**

(Since "pro" is a prefix, it doesn't have verb tenses in the same way.)  It's always used in combination with another word.


Pro-choice advocates support abortion rights. = 支持选择权的倡导者支持堕胎权。

Again,  "proappropriation" is not a recognized word. The above analysis provides information about the individual components, allowing you to understand what such a hypothetical word *might* mean, but its meaning would depend entirely on the context in which it is used.
