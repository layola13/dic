词源:
The word "schooldays" is a compound noun, formed from "school" and "days."  "School" comes from the Old English *scōlu, meaning "leisure, spare time," ultimately deriving from the Late Latin *schola, "leisure, school."  "Days" is the plural of the Old English *dæg, meaning "day."  Therefore, "schooldays" literally means "the days spent at school."
