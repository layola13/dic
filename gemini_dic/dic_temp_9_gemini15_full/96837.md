词源：
The word "inevitabilities" comes from the adjective "inevitable," which is formed from the prefix "in-" (not) + "evitable" (avoidable).  "Evitable" ultimately derives from the Latin verb "vitare" (to avoid).  Therefore, "inevitable" means "not avoidable," and "inevitabilities" refers to the plural instances of things that cannot be avoided.
