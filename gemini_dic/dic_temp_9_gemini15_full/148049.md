词源:

The word "overrunner" comes from the verb "overrun," which is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "above," "beyond," or "excessively") and the verb "run."  The "-er" suffix indicates an agent or doer of the action.  Therefore, an "overrunner" is literally something or someone that runs over or exceeds a limit.
