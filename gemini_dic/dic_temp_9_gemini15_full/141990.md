词源:
The word "organicity" is derived from the word "organic," which ultimately comes from the Greek word "organikos," meaning "of or relating to organs."  The suffix "-ity" forms nouns of quality or state.  Therefore, "organicity" signifies the quality or state of being organic, often implying a sense of wholeness or interconnectedness.
