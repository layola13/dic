词源:
The word "homestead" comes from the Old English words "hām" (home) and "stede" (place).  It literally means "home place."  The meaning evolved to encompass not just the dwelling itself, but also the surrounding land associated with a family's home, particularly in the context of farming.  The Homestead Act of 1862 in the United States further solidified the association of the word with farming and land ownership.
