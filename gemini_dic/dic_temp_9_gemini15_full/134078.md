/ˌnɒnɪˈluːsɪvnəsɪz/ | n. |非虚幻性；非幻觉性 |The word "nonillusivenesses" is extremely rare and not found in standard dictionaries. It is a complex, artificially constructed word formed by combining several morphemes.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not," "illus" is the root related to "illusion," "-ive" is a suffix creating an adjective, "-ness" is a suffix forming a noun denoting a state or quality, and "-es" is a plural suffix.  Therefore, the word attempts to describe the plural states or qualities of "not being illusory" or "lacking illusion."  The word is highly unwieldy and would rarely, if ever, be used in actual communication. There are no standard examples, near synonyms, or antonyms. The word is grammatically correct but semantically awkward.


USAGE->
This word is so rare and unusual that providing grammatical examples is pointless.  It's not a word that would be used in standard English grammar.


PHRASE->
N/A (The word itself is not used in phrases)
