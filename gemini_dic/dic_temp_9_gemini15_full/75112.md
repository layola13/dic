词源:The word "frippery" ultimately derives from the Old French word "friper," meaning "to fray," "to rub," or "to wear away."  This suggests an association with things that are worn, tattered, or of little value. Over time, the meaning shifted to encompass showy but ultimately worthless items. The plural "fripperies" emphasizes the collection of such insignificant details.
