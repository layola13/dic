hypergenetically:/ˌhaɪpərˌdʒɛˈnɛtɪkli/ | adj. | 超基因地，超遗传地 | Relating to or characterized by hypergenesis, a process involving the acceleration or intensification of genetic change beyond what is typically observed.  This term is primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly in evolutionary biology and genetics, to describe phenomena where genetic changes occur at an unusually rapid rate or with unusual intensity.  |  The rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria can be described as hypergenetically driven.  The hypergenetically altered population showed increased fitness in the novel environment.| 近义词: rapidly evolving, acceleratedly evolving | 反义词:  slowly evolving, genetically stable
