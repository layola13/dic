词源:  Derived from "mystical," which comes from the Middle English "mystical," ultimately from the Late Latin "mysticālis," meaning "of or pertaining to mysteries," from the Greek "μυστικός" (mustikos), meaning "secret, mysterious," from "μῦθος" (mythos), meaning "myth, story, word."  The suffix "-ity" forms nouns of quality or state.
