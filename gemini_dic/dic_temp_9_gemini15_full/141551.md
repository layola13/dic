词源:  The word "opposed" comes from the verb "oppose," which originates from the Old French word "opposer," meaning "to place against," "to set against," or "to resist."  This, in turn, comes from the Latin "oppōnere," a compound of "ob-" (against) and "pōnere" (to put, place).  Therefore, the core meaning has always been about placing something against something else, leading to opposition or resistance.
