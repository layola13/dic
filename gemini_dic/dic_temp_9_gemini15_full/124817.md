mucin:/ˈmjuːsɪn/ | n. |粘蛋白| A viscous glycoprotein secreted by mucous membranes that lubricates and protects the underlying tissues.  It's a major component of mucus. | Example: The lubricating mucin in saliva helps with swallowing.  唾液中的润滑粘蛋白有助于吞咽。|近义词：glycoprotein, mucus (partially)|反义词:  (no direct antonym, but "dryness" is a contrasting concept)|
