词源:
The word "pre-emptive" is derived from the verb "pre-empt," which itself comes from the Old French "preemter," meaning "to take beforehand."  The prefix "pre-" indicates "before," and "-empt" is related to the Latin "emere," meaning "to buy" or "to take."  Therefore, the original meaning was to buy or take something before someone else.  The modern meaning has evolved to encompass actions taken before others, often to prevent something undesirable.
