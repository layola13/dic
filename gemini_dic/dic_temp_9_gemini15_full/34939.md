The word "clobber" likely originated as a slang term, possibly from a dialectal variant of "club" (meaning to hit with a club)  or possibly related to the Middle English word "cloppen," which meant to hit or strike. Its exact etymology is uncertain but reflects a long history of colloquial usage for forceful hitting.
