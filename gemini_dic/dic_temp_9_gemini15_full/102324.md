The term derives from the phrase "ivory tower," which itself originates from a French fairy tale.  The metaphorical "ivory tower" represents a place of seclusion and isolation, often associated with intellectuals or artists who are seen as detached from the concerns of everyday life.  The suffix "-ite" is added to create a noun denoting a person associated with something.  Therefore, "ivory-towerite" describes a person inhabiting or embodying the characteristics of an ivory tower.
