dirigibilities:/ˌdɪrɪdʒɪˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可操纵性；飞艇性能 | The study of dirigibilities focuses on the controllability and maneuverability of airships.  对飞艇可操纵性的研究集中在飞艇的可控性和机动性上。 | 近义词：maneuverability, controllability | 反义词：uncontrollability, inflexibility |  名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The dirigibility of the new airship is being tested. = 新飞艇的可操纵性正在测试中。
Its dirigibility allows for precise navigation. = 它的可操纵性允许精确的导航。


一般过去时:
The dirigibility of the older model was poor. = 旧型号的可操纵性很差。
We tested the dirigibility in various wind conditions. = 我们在各种风力条件下测试了它的可操纵性。


现在完成时:
Engineers have improved the dirigibility significantly. = 工程师们已经大大提高了可操纵性。
They have demonstrated the superior dirigibility of their design. = 他们已经展示了他们设计的优越的可操纵性。


过去完成时:
Before the modifications, the dirigibility had been inadequate. = 在改进之前，可操纵性不足。
The pilots had never experienced such poor dirigibility before. = 飞行员们以前从未经历过如此糟糕的可操纵性。


将来时:
Future airships will have enhanced dirigibility. = 未来的飞艇将具有增强的可操纵性。
We will assess the dirigibility after the flight tests. = 我们将在飞行测试后评估可操纵性。


虚拟语气:
If the dirigibility were better, the mission would be easier. = 如果可操纵性更好，任务就会更容易。
I wish the dirigibility of this model were improved. = 我希望这个型号的可操纵性能得到改进。


被动语态:
The dirigibility is being carefully evaluated. = 可操纵性正在被仔细评估。
The dirigibility was affected by the strong winds. = 可操纵性受到强风的影響。


疑问句:
What is the dirigibility of this type of airship? = 这种飞艇的可操纵性如何？
How does the dirigibility compare to previous models? = 它的可操纵性与之前的型号相比如何？


否定句:
The airship lacked sufficient dirigibility. = 飞艇缺乏足够的可操纵性。
The poor weather conditions negated any improvements in dirigibility. = 恶劣的天气条件抵消了可操纵性的任何改进。


PHRASE->
There is no common phrase using "dirigibilities".  The word itself is rarely used outside of technical contexts.  Instead, related phrases like "airship maneuverability," "airship control," or "flight characteristics" would be used.
