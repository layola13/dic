词源:
The word "cellulite" is a relatively modern coinage, a blend of "cell" (referring to fat cells) and the suffix "-itis," which commonly indicates inflammation.  However, it's important to note that cellulite is not actually an inflammatory condition.  The term emerged in the mid-20th century, gaining popularity as a marketing term in the beauty industry.  Its etymology reflects the initial misunderstanding of the condition's underlying cause.
