词源:
The word "nymphean" derives from the Greek word "nymphe" (νύμφη), meaning "nymph," a mythological creature of nature, often associated with water, woods, or mountains. The suffix "-ean" is used to form adjectives indicating belonging or relation to something.  Therefore, "nymphean" literally means "of or relating to nymphs."
