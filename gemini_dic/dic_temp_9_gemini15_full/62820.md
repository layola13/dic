词源:
The verb "enhedge" is a relatively recent formation, combining the prefix "en-" (meaning "to cause to be" or "to make") with the noun "hedge," which has a long history rooted in Old English.  The original meaning of "hedge" related to a physical boundary (a fence of bushes or shrubs), later evolving to encompass the financial concept of mitigating risk.  Therefore, "enhedge" literally means "to cause to be hedged," or to actively engage in risk-mitigation strategies.
