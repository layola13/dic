词源:

The word "fictionalizers" is a relatively modern coinage, formed by adding the agentive suffix "-er" to the verb "fictionalize."  "Fictionalize" itself combines "fiction" (from Latin *fictiōn-, from *fingere "to feign, fashion, invent")  with the verb suffix "-ize" (from Greek -ίζειν, -izein).  Therefore, "fictionalizers" literally means "those who make into fiction."
