近义词：animosity, hostility, resentment, malice, spite, rancor | 反义词： goodwill, benevolence, kindness, affection


词源:  The word is a compound of "ill" (meaning bad or evil) and "will" (meaning intention or desire).  Therefore, it literally means "bad intention" or "evil intent."  The meaning evolved to refer specifically to the feeling of ill intention rather than the intention itself.
