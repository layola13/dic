词源:  The word "corselet" comes from the Old French word "corselet," which itself derives from the Old French word "cors" meaning "body" or "trunk." The diminutive suffix "-et" was added, indicating something small or a smaller version of something.  The original meaning referred to a piece of armor covering the body, particularly the torso, before evolving to its modern meaning of a type of undergarment.
