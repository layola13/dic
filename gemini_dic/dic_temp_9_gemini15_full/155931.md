photodissociate:/ˌfoʊtoʊdɪˈsoʊʃieɪt/ | v. |光致解离|The process by which a molecule breaks down into smaller fragments upon absorbing a photon of sufficient energy.  This process is common in photochemistry and is crucial in many atmospheric and astrophysical processes.| Example:  UV light can photodissociate ozone molecules in the stratosphere.  紫外线可以使平流层中的臭氧分子发生光致解离。 |近义词：photolyse, photodecompose |反义词：photoassociation
