词源:
The word "rump" comes from the Middle English word "rompe," which meant "buttocks" or "hindquarters."  This, in turn, likely derives from an Old Norse word with a similar meaning.  The modern use of "rump" to refer to the remaining or leftover part of something is a later development, a metaphorical extension of its original meaning.
