rhoticity:/roʊˈtɪsəti/ | n. | 元音后辅音r的发音 | The pronunciation of the letter "r" after a vowel.  Rhoticity refers to the pronunciation of the "r" sound after a vowel.  Languages or dialects can be described as rhotic (pronouncing the "r") or non-rhotic (not pronouncing the "r"). For example, in non-rhotic accents of English, the "r" in words like "car" or "mother" is not pronounced when it appears at the end of a word or before a consonant.  However, in rhotic accents, the "r" is pronounced in these cases. | Example:  General American English is a rhotic accent, while Received Pronunciation (RP) is generally non-rhotic.  The difference is noticeable in words like "car" (pronounced "car" in rhotic accents and "cah" in non-rhotic accents). | 近义词: r-coloring | 反义词: non-rhoticity
