词源:

The word derives from the adjective "insular," meaning "relating to or characteristic of an island."  "Insular" itself comes from the Latin word "insula," meaning "island." The suffix "-ities" forms a noun meaning "qualities or characteristics of."  Therefore, "insularities" literally means "the qualities or characteristics of an island" but figuratively refers to the narrow-mindedness and isolation often associated with island life.
