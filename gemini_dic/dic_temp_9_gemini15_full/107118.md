词源:
The name "ladybird" is believed to have originated in medieval Europe.  The insect was associated with the Virgin Mary, and the word "lady" referred to the Virgin Mary or Our Lady.  "Bird" is thought to be a corruption of "brīd," an Old English word for "insect".  Therefore, the name "ladybird" literally translates to "the Virgin Mary's insect".  The name "ladybug" is a more recent variant, appearing later in North America.
