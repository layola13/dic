ionizations:/ˌaɪənɪˈzeɪʃənz/| n.|电离作用；电离现象|The process of ionizing or being ionized; the act or instance of converting an atom or molecule into an ion.  It involves the addition or removal of electrons, resulting in a net positive or negative charge.|例句：The high energy radiation caused ionizations in the air. 高能辐射导致空气电离。|例句：Studies of ionization processes are crucial for understanding atmospheric chemistry. 电离过程的研究对于理解大气化学至关重要。|近义词：ionization, ion formation|反义词：recombination


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Ionizations occur naturally in the atmosphere. = 电离作用在大气中自然发生。
The experiment measures the rate of ionizations. = 实验测量电离速率。

一般过去时:
High-energy particles caused many ionizations. = 高能粒子引起许多电离。
The researchers observed several ionizations during the experiment. = 研究人员在实验中观察到几次电离。

现在完成时:
Scientists have studied ionizations for many years. = 科学家们已经研究电离作用多年了。
Significant progress has been made in understanding ionizations. = 在理解电离方面已经取得了重大进展。

过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had predicted the number of ionizations. = 在实验之前，他们已经预测了电离的数量。
The team had already observed similar ionizations in previous studies. = 该团队已经在之前的研究中观察到类似的电离现象。

将来时:
We will investigate different types of ionizations. = 我们将研究不同类型的电离。
Future research will focus on the effects of ionizations. = 未来的研究将集中在电离的影响上。

虚拟语气:
If the voltage were higher, more ionizations would occur. = 如果电压更高，就会发生更多的电离。
I wish we had more data on the ionizations. = 我希望我们有更多关于电离的数据。

被动语态:
Ionizations are often caused by radiation. = 电离作用通常是由辐射引起的。
The ionizations were carefully measured by the researchers. = 电离作用由研究人员仔细测量。

疑问句:
What causes these ionizations? = 什么导致了这些电离？
How many ionizations were detected? = 检测到多少次电离？

否定句:
No ionizations were detected in the control group. = 对照组中未检测到电离。
The experiment did not produce the expected number of ionizations. = 实验没有产生预期的电离数量。
