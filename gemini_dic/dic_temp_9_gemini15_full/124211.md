The word "mosites" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical explanations as requested.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:** Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* **It's a neologism or technical term:**  It might be a newly coined word, a term specific to a particular field (like a niche scientific area), or slang. If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it might be possible to determine its meaning.
* **It's a proper noun:** It could be a place name, company name, or a name with an unusual spelling.

Please provide more information so I can assist you better.
