词源:  The word "epoxied" is derived from "epoxy," which itself comes from the chemical structure of epoxy resins, characterized by an epoxide group (a three-membered ring containing one oxygen atom and two carbon atoms).  The suffix "-ed" indicates the past participle or adjective form, signifying something that has been treated with epoxy.
