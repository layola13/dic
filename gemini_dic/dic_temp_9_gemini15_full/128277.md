neuroplasticity: /ˌnʊroʊplæˈstɪsəti/ | n. | 神经可塑性 | The ability of the brain to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections throughout life.  This allows the brain to adapt to new experiences, learn new skills, and recover from injury. | Example:  Neuroplasticity allows the brain to adapt to new languages and experiences.  神经可塑性使大脑能够适应新的语言和经验。  |近义词: neural plasticity, brain plasticity | 反义词: neural inflexibility

词源:
The term "neuroplasticity" is a combination of "neuro," from the Greek word "neuron" (νεῦρον) meaning "nerve," and "plasticity," from the Greek word "plastikos" (πλαστικός) meaning "capable of being molded."  Therefore, neuroplasticity literally means "the ability of the nervous system to be molded or changed."
