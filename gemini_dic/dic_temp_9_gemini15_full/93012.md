WORD ORIGIN->
The word "idiosyncratically" is derived from the noun "idiosyncrasy"  ( /ˌɪdiːsɪŋˈkrəsi/ ), which itself comes from the Greek words "idios" (ἴδιος) meaning "one's own," "private," or "peculiar," and "synkrasis" (σύνκρασις) meaning "a mixing together" or "temperament."   Therefore, the original meaning referred to a peculiar temperament or constitution of an individual.  The adverbial form "-ically"  was added to create "idiosyncratically," indicating a manner or style of action.
