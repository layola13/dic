词源:

The word "demi-culverin" is a compound word.  "Demi-" is from Old French, meaning "half," indicating a size smaller than a full culverin.  "Culverin" itself has a complex etymology, possibly derived from the Arabic word *qulubrīn* or a variant thereof, ultimately referring to a type of cannon.  The precise origin of "culverin" is still debated amongst etymologists.
