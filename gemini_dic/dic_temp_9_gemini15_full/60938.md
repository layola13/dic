词源:

Elevation comes from the Latin word "elevatio," meaning "a raising up" or "a lifting."  It's formed from the verb "elevare," which combines "e-" (intensive prefix) and "levare" (to lift or raise).  The word thus reflects its core meaning of raising something to a higher position, whether literally (height) or figuratively (status).
