quasi-enviously: /ˈkwɑːziˈɛnvɪəsli/ | adv. |近乎嫉妒地，带着几分嫉妒地 |

英文解析:The adverb "quasi-enviously" describes an action or feeling that is similar to envy but not quite as intense or complete. It suggests a feeling of slight or subdued envy, perhaps mixed with other emotions.  The "quasi-" prefix indicates something that resembles or has the characteristics of something else but is not entirely that thing.

例句:
She looked at her friend's new car quasi-enviously, a hint of admiration mixed with her own financial limitations.  = 她带着几分嫉妒地看了看朋友的新车，一丝钦佩之情夹杂着自己经济上的局限。

He watched their success quasi-enviously, knowing he had contributed to it but not fully shared in the rewards. = 他近乎嫉妒地注视着他们的成功，知道自己为之做出了贡献，但并没有完全分享到回报。


近义词: enviously, with a tinge of envy, somewhat enviously, grudgingly admiringly

词性: 副词 (adverb)

词源:
* **quasi-**:  From Latin "quasi," meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation.
* **enviously**: From "envy," which originates from Old French "envie" and ultimately from Latin "invidia," meaning "envy," "ill will," or "hatred."
