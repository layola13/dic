词源:

The word "overweeningness" is derived from the adjective "overweening," which itself comes from the Old English "oferwenan," meaning "to overpower, overcome."  The "over-" prefix indicates excess, while the root suggests a sense of self-importance or dominance. The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being overweening.
