The word "nonelusive" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a neologism (a newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we can analyze the potential meaning based on its parts:

* **non-**: This is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of."
* **elusive**: This is an adjective meaning difficult to find, catch, or achieve.

Therefore, "nonelusive" would logically mean "not elusive," or "easy to find, catch, or achieve."  However, because it's not a standard word, there's no established pronunciation, usage examples, synonyms, or antonyms in standard dictionaries.


To illustrate how the format would look if "nonelusive" *were* a standard word, I'll use the word "elusive" instead:


elusive: /ɪˈluːsɪv/ | adj. | 难以捉摸的，难以表达的，难以实现的 | Difficult to find, catch, or achieve; hard to describe or express. |  The answer to the riddle proved elusive.  谜底证明难以捉摸。 |  evasive, slippery, hard-to-pin-down  |  obvious, apparent, straightforward | adj.
