词源:  The word "coincidently" is derived from the adjective "coincident," which itself comes from the Latin word "coincidere," meaning "to fall together."  The prefix "co-" means "together," and "incidere" means "to fall."  Thus, the original meaning refers to events happening at the same time. The adverbial "-ly" suffix was added to create the adverbial form.
