词源:

The word "expositor" comes from the Latin word "expositor," meaning "one who sets forth," "expounder," or "interpreter."  It's derived from the verb "exponere," meaning "to set forth," "to explain," or "to expose."  The prefix "ex-" means "out" or "from," and the root "-ponere" means "to place" or "to put."  Therefore, the word literally means "one who puts forth" or "one who explains."
