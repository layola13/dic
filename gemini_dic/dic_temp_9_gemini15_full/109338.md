词源:

The word "lenient" originates from the Old French word "lenient," meaning "slow, mild, gentle." This in turn derives from the Latin word "lenis," meaning "gentle, soft, mild."  The semantic shift from "gentle" to "forgiving" likely occurred due to the association of gentleness with a less harsh form of judgment or punishment.
