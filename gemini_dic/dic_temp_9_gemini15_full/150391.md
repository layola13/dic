词源:  From Middle French *panoplie, from Old French panoplie "complete suit of armor," of uncertain origin, possibly from Greek panoplia "full armor," from pan- "all" + hopla "arms, weapons."  The modern sense developed from the original meaning of a complete suit of armor to a broader sense of a complete and impressive array of things.
