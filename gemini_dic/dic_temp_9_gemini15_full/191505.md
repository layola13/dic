词源:
The word "schmaltzy" likely originates from the Yiddish word "schmalz," meaning "rendered chicken fat," or more broadly, something rich or excessive.  The connection lies in the idea that something "schmaltzy" is overly rich and excessive in its sentimentality, like an overabundance of schmaltz (chicken fat).  The -y suffix transforms it into an adjective.
