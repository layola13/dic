Etymology:

The word "mixtilinear" is a combination of:

* **"mixti-"**:  From Latin "mixtus," the past participle of "miscere," meaning "to mix."  This indicates a combination or mixture of elements.
* **"-linear"**: From Latin "linearis," meaning "of or pertaining to a line."  This refers to the geometric aspect of lines.


Therefore, "mixtilinear" literally means "of mixed lines," describing a figure or shape composed of both straight and curved lines.
