词源:
The word "foxy" ultimately derives from "fox," referring to the animal known for its cunning and slyness.  The adjective "foxy" adopted this connotation of clever deception and later expanded to include a sense of alluring attractiveness, particularly in women.  The connection between cunning and attractiveness is likely due to the perceived power and allure associated with clever manipulation.
