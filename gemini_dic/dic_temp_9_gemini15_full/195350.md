semimagnetical: /ˌsɛmiˌmæɡˈnɛtɪkəl/ | adj. | 半磁性的 | Partially magnetic; exhibiting some magnetic properties.  The word combines "semi-" (half, partly) with "magnetical" (relating to magnetism).  It describes substances or phenomena that show some, but not all, characteristics of magnetism.


例句：

The material showed semimagnetical properties at low temperatures. =  这种材料在低温下表现出半磁性。

The experiment demonstrated a semimagnetical response to the applied field. = 实验表明对施加的磁场有半磁性反应。


近义词：partially magnetic, weakly magnetic


反义词：strongly magnetic, fully magnetic, non-magnetic


词源:

* **semi-**:  From Latin *semi*, meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."  This prefix is widely used in English to indicate something that is incomplete or partial.

* **magnetical**: From "magnetism," ultimately derived from the Greek word  μαγνητισμός (magnētismos), referring to the properties of lodestone (a naturally occurring magnetic iron ore) from Magnesia, a region in ancient Greece.  "-ical" is a suffix forming adjectives from nouns.


USAGE->

(Since "semimagnetical" is an adjective,  verb tenses don't apply directly.  Usage examples focus on its function in sentences.)

Descriptive sentences:

The sample exhibited semimagnetical behavior. = 样本表现出半磁性行为。

This alloy possesses semimagnetical characteristics. = 这种合金具有半磁性特性。


Comparative sentences:

The semimagnetical properties of this material are weaker than those of iron. = 这种材料的半磁性比铁弱。

Compared to a ferromagnet, this material is only semimagnetical. = 与铁磁体相比，这种材料只是半磁性的。


PHRASE->

(Phrases using "semimagnetical" are less common and would typically be context-specific.  It's more often used as a descriptive adjective within a larger phrase, rather than forming common idiomatic expressions.)

Examples of phrases where it might appear:

semimagnetical properties  = 半磁性特性
semimagnetical behavior = 半磁性行为
semimagnetical response = 半磁性响应
observation of semimagnetical effects = 半磁性效应的观察
study of semimagnetical materials = 半磁性材料的研究
