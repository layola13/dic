词源:

The word "macronodular" is a combination of:

* **macro-**:  From Greek *makros*, meaning "large," "long," or "great."
* **nodular**: From Latin *nodulus*, a diminutive of *nodus*, meaning "knot."  This refers to a small, round lump or swelling.

Therefore, "macronodular" literally means "having large nodules."
