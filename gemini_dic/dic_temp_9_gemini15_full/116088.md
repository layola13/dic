The word "martyrial" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it in Merriam-Webster, Oxford English Dictionary, or other reputable sources.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "martial," "material," or "martyr."
2. **A neologism or very rare word:**  A newly coined word or one used in a highly specialized field.
3. **A proper noun:**  Perhaps it's a name or place name.
