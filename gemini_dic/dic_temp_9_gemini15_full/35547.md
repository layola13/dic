词源：

From the verb "coalesce," which is derived from the Latin word "coalescere," meaning "to grow together."  The prefix "co-" means "together," and "alescere" is related to the verb "alere," meaning "to nourish" or "to grow."  Thus, the original meaning points to a process of growing together or uniting.
