词源:
The word "entrepreneurisms" is a relatively recent coinage, formed by adding the suffix "-isms" (denoting a doctrine, system, or practice) to the word "entrepreneur."  "Entrepreneur" itself originates from the French word "entreprendre," meaning "to undertake."  Thus, "entrepreneurisms" essentially refers to the principles, practices, and overall ideology associated with entrepreneurial activity.
