self-extinctions:/ˌsɛlf ɪkˈstɪŋkʃənz/| n. |物种自我灭绝；自我消亡|The term "self-extinctions" refers to the extinction of a species primarily due to its own inherent characteristics or behaviors, rather than external factors like environmental changes or predation.  This can involve factors such as poor adaptation to changing environments,  inability to compete for resources,  or detrimental social behaviors.  It is a concept often debated within evolutionary biology and ecology. |Example:  The dodo bird's self-extinctions is often cited as a case study in how a species' lack of fear of humans and limited adaptability contributed to its demise.|近义词：self-annihilation, auto-extinction |反义词：survival, persistence
