词源:
The word "gentlemanly" derives from "gentleman," which itself has a complex etymology.  "Gentle" originally meant "of noble birth,"  related to Old French "gentil" and ultimately to Latin "gens" (people, race).  "Man" refers to an adult male human.  Therefore, "gentleman" originally meant a man of noble birth, but over time, the meaning shifted to describe a man of refined manners and high moral character, regardless of social rank.  The suffix "-ly" transforms the noun "gentleman" into an adjective describing qualities associated with a gentleman.
