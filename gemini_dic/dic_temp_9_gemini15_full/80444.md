词源:
The word "goner" likely originates from the earlier term "gone," signifying a state of being lost, destroyed, or dead. The suffix "-er" adds a sense of agency or personification, making it an adjective or noun describing something or someone in that state.  The evolution likely reflects colloquial usage emphasizing the finality of the situation.
