词源:  The word "proactivities" is a relatively modern term derived from the adjective "proactive," which itself is a combination of the prefix "pro-" (meaning "before" or "in favor of") and the word "active."  The "-ities" suffix transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying qualities or actions.
