USAGE->

This word is extremely rare and does not have common usage examples across different tenses or grammatical structures like "what".  The usage would be highly context-dependent and likely found in specialized fields like musicology or philosophy discussing aesthetics or the anticipation of harmony.  Standard tense examples are thus inapplicable.


PHRASE->

There are no established or common phrases using "preharmoniousness".  The word itself is too uncommon for idiomatic expressions.
