recombining:/ˌriːkəmˈbaɪnɪŋ/ | v. |重组，重新组合 | The act of combining again, especially genetic material.  This refers to the process where genetic material is rearranged to form new combinations of alleles. This is a crucial process in genetic diversity and evolution. | Example: Recombining DNA fragments is a key technique in genetic engineering.  重组DNA片段是基因工程的关键技术。  The researchers are studying the rate of recombining genes in bacteria. 研究人员正在研究细菌基因重组的速率。|近义词：reorganizing, rearranging, restructuring |反义词：separating, dividing, disintegrating |动词
