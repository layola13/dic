/kəmˈpjuːtərdʌmz/ | n. | 电脑领域；计算机世界 | The word "computerdoms" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, possibly formed by combining "computer" and a suffix resembling "-doms" (often indicating a realm or domain).  Therefore, a standard dictionary definition or detailed grammatical analysis is not available.  Its meaning would depend entirely on the context in which it's used.  The intended meaning might be related to the world of computers, the industry, or the influence of computers on society.  |  Example: "He's an expert in the intricate computerdoms of artificial intelligence." (This sentence uses the word to refer to the field of AI within the broader world of computing.) |  近义词: cyberspace, digital world, computing world | 反义词: N/A (no direct antonym exists due to the neologistic nature of the word) | noun
