词源：

The phrase "get the hook" originates from the practice in some entertainment venues (like nightclubs or bars) of using a literal hook to signal to a performer that their time is up.  This could be a musician, a comedian, or other entertainer.  The hook literally "hooks" the performer, signaling the end of their set.  The metaphorical usage extends this to any situation where someone is abruptly dismissed or terminated.  The imagery of being "hooked" conveys a sense of suddenness and finality.
