protometals: /ˌproʊtoʊˈmɛtəlz/ | n. | 原金属；前金属 |  Protometals refer to substances or materials that precede or are precursors to true metals in terms of their development or use in human history. They are often naturally occurring metallic compounds or alloys that were used before the widespread extraction and processing of pure metals.  Examples include naturally occurring alloys like electrum (a gold-silver alloy) or arsenical copper, which were utilized in early metalworking before techniques for smelting pure metals were developed. |  The discovery of protometals significantly advanced early human technology, allowing for the creation of more durable and sophisticated tools and artifacts.  | 近义词：precursors, early metals | 反义词：pure metals
