centipedal: /ˌsɛnˈtɪpɪdəl/ | adj. |向心的；趋向中心的| Relating to or directed toward a center.  The term describes a force, motion, or effect directed towards the center of something, typically in a circular or rotational system. |例句：The centripetal force keeps the planets in orbit around the sun. 向心力使行星绕太阳运行。|近义词：centripetal, converging |反义词： centrifugal


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The centripetal force acts on the rotating object. = 向心力作用于旋转物体。
This centripetal acceleration keeps the car on the track. = 这种向心加速度使汽车保持在轨道上。


一般过去时:
The centripetal force pulled the ball inwards. = 向心力将球向内拉。
The centripetal acceleration slowed the spinning top down. = 向心加速度使旋转的陀螺慢了下来。


现在完成时:
The spinning top has experienced a significant centripetal force. = 旋转的陀螺已经经历了显著的向心力。
The satellite has maintained its orbit due to centripetal acceleration. = 由于向心加速度，卫星保持了其轨道。


过去完成时:
The ball had already been affected by the centripetal force before it reached the center. = 球在到达中心之前就已经受到向心力的影响了。
The carousel had completed several rotations due to the constant centripetal force. = 由于持续的向心力，旋转木马已经完成了多次旋转。


将来时:
The centripetal force will keep the moon in orbit around the Earth. = 向心力将使月球绕地球运行。
The astronaut will experience high centripetal acceleration during the launch. = 宇航员在发射过程中将经历高向心加速度。


虚拟语气:
If the centripetal force were to disappear, the planets would fly off into space. = 如果向心力消失，行星就会飞向太空。
I wish I understood the calculation of centripetal force better. = 我希望我能更好地理解向心力的计算。


被动语态:
The object was pulled inwards by the centripetal force. = 物体被向心力向内拉。
The speed of rotation was determined by the centripetal acceleration. = 旋转速度由向心加速度决定。


疑问句:
What is the magnitude of the centripetal force? = 向心力的量级是多少？
How is centripetal acceleration calculated? = 如何计算向心加速度？


否定句:
The object did not experience a significant centripetal force. = 物体没有经历显著的向心力。
Without centripetal force, the object would move in a straight line. = 没有向心力，物体将沿直线运动。


PHRASE->
centripetal acceleration 向心加速度
centripetal force 向心力
centripetal motion 向心运动
centripetal component 向心分量
centripetal effect 向心效应
