WORD ORIGIN->

The word "Kapelle" comes from the Late Latin word "capella," meaning "small chapel," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "cappa," meaning "cloak" or "cape."  The connection lies in the fact that relics of saints were often kept in a small chapel, and these relics were sometimes covered with a cape or cloak.  The word's use to describe a musical ensemble is a later development, likely referencing the musicians who performed in chapels.
