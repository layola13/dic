preconversion: /ˌpriːkənˈvɜːrʒən/ | n. | 预转换；预转化 | The process or instance of converting something before a main conversion process.  It often involves preparatory steps or changes to optimize the main conversion. For example, in data processing, preconversion might involve cleaning or formatting data before it's converted to a different format.  In chemical engineering, it might involve preparing a substance for a chemical reaction. | Example: The preconversion of the raw data significantly improved the accuracy of the final results.  = 预处理的原始数据大大提高了最终结果的准确性。 The preconversion stage in this manufacturing process is crucial for efficiency. = 在这个制造过程中，预转换阶段对于效率至关重要。 | 近义词: preprocessing, preparation, preliminary conversion | 反义词: postconversion
