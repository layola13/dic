This term is primarily used in biology and embryology, specifically in the context of egg development and fertilization.  It describes the area or layer surrounding the yolk of an egg but inside the vitelline membrane.  The perivitelline space is the gap between the yolk and the vitelline membrane.


例句：

* The sperm must penetrate the perivitelline layer to reach the egg. 精子必须穿透卵黄膜外的层才能到达卵子。

*  Studies have shown variations in the perivitelline fluid composition across different species. 研究表明，不同物种的卵黄膜外液成分存在差异。


近义词:

While there isn't a perfect synonym, "peri-yolky" could be used informally to convey a similar meaning.


反义词:

The antonym would be a term indicating something *within* the yolk, such as "intra-vitelline".
