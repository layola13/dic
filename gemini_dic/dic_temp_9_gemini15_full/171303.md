ptomaine:/ˈtoʊmeɪn/| n.| 尸碱；毒蛋白（现已知此词用法不准确）|Ptomaine is a term that was once used to refer to a group of poisonous substances, supposedly produced by decaying organic matter, that were thought to cause food poisoning. However, this term is now considered obsolete and inaccurate by scientists.  The symptoms attributed to "ptomaine poisoning" are actually caused by various bacteria and their toxins, not by ptomaines themselves. | Example:  The old belief that eating spoiled food would lead to "ptomaine poisoning" is now outdated.  过时的说法认为食用腐败食物会导致“尸碱中毒”。|近义词：food poisoning (more accurate term), bacterial toxins|反义词：None (the term itself is obsolete and inaccurate)
