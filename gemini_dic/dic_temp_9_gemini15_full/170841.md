pseudogamy:/ˈsuːdəɡæmi/| n. |假受精；假两性生殖；伪受精|The process in which the stimulus of pollination or fertilization is required for fruit or seed development, but the genetic material of the pollen does not contribute to the offspring.  This often occurs in plants where the ovule develops into a seed asexually, even though pollination has occurred. | Example: Pseudogamy is observed in some species of plants where the pollen grain triggers seed development but doesn't contribute to the genetic makeup of the offspring.  假受精在某些植物物种中被观察到，花粉粒触发种子发育，但不参与后代的基因构成。|近义词：parthenocarpy (if referring to fruit development without fertilization)|反义词：amphimixis (true fertilization)|
