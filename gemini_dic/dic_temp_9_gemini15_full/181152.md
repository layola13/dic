词源：  The word "reinforcements" comes from the verb "reinforce," which itself is derived from the Old French "renforcer," meaning "to strengthen."  "Re-" is a prefix meaning "again" or "back," and "forcer" comes from the Latin "fortis," meaning "strong."  Therefore, "reinforcements" literally means "the act of making something strong again."
