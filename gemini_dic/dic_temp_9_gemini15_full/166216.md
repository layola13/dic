词源:
The word "prequalified" is formed by adding the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") to the adjective "qualified."  "Qualified" ultimately derives from the verb "qualify," from the Latin "qualificare," meaning "to make fit, to describe."  Therefore, "prequalified" means "made fit or judged suitable beforehand."
