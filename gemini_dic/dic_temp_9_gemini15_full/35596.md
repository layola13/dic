词源:
From Middle English *corsnes, from Old French *cors, from Vulgar Latin *corsium, from Latin *corium ("hide, skin").  The shift in meaning from "hide" to "roughness" likely arose from the texture of animal hides.  The extension to "vulgarity" reflects the association of rough, unrefined things with lack of social grace.
