词源:
The word "credential" comes from the Old French word "credencial," meaning "letter of credence,"  ultimately derived from the Latin "credentia," meaning "belief, trust, or credit."  The suffix "-al" indicates an adjective or noun related to the root word.  The evolution reflects the historical use of letters of recommendation and similar documents as proof of trustworthiness and qualifications.
