eutectic:/juːˈtɛktɪk/| n. |共晶，低共熔|A eutectic is a mixture of substances that melts and solidifies at a single temperature, lower than the melting point of any of the individual components.  This is because the mixture forms a unique crystal structure that is more stable than the individual components. Eutectic systems are important in many areas, including metallurgy, ceramics, and food science.|Example: The eutectic point of a lead-tin alloy is important for soldering because it ensures a strong and consistent bond.  共晶合金的熔点是焊接中的重要参数，因为它能保证牢固且一致的结合。|近义词：low-melting alloy,  共晶合金|反义词：N/A
