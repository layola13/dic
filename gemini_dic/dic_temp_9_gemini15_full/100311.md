词源:

The word "intersituate" appears to be a relatively recent coinage, formed by combining the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") with "situate" (meaning "to place" or "to locate").  The "-ate" suffix transforms the verb "situate" into a more active and transitive form, suggesting an action of placing things in relation to each other.  There is no established etymology in standard dictionaries, indicating its novel or niche usage.
