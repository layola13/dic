USAGE->
This word is a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like the example word "what".  It describes a state or quality, and therefore doesn't take different tenses.  Grammatical usage would focus on sentence structure involving this noun.

Example Sentences:

The study compared the reduciblenesses of different algorithms. = 这项研究比较了不同算法的可约性。

The various reduciblenesses of the data sets caused complications in the analysis. = 数据集的不同可约性给分析带来了复杂性。


PHRASE->

The word "reduciblenesses" is not typically used in phrases.  It's a relatively uncommon and technical word.  Phrases would need to be constructed around the concept of reducibility rather than the word itself.  Examples that convey the meaning:

degree of reducibility = 可约程度
various reducibilities = 各种可约性
limitations of reducibility = 可约性的局限性
problem's reducibility = 问题的可约性
analysis of reducibility = 可约性分析
