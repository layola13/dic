词源:
The word "obedient" originates from the Old French word "obedient," which itself comes from the Latin word "obēdiēns," the present participle of "obēdīre," meaning "to obey."  "Obēdīre" is composed of the prefix "ob-" (towards) and "audīre" (to hear, to listen).  Thus, the root meaning suggests listening to and following instructions.
