词源:

The word "selflessly" is derived from the adjective "selfless," which is formed by combining the prefix "self-" (meaning "of or relating to oneself") with the suffix "-less" (meaning "without").  Therefore, "selfless" means "without self," implying a lack of self-interest or selfishness.  The adverbial form "-ly" is then added to create "selflessly," indicating the manner in which an action is performed.
