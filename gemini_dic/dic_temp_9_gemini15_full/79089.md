Glaciations refer to periods of widespread glaciation, often characterized by lower global temperatures and significant ice sheet expansion.|例句：The last glaciation ended about 11,700 years ago.  最后一次冰川作用在大约11700年前结束。|例句：Multiple glaciations have shaped the topography of this region. 多次冰川作用塑造了该地区的地形。|近义词：ice ages, glacial periods|反义词：interglacial periods, deglaciation

Before the last glaciation, the climate was warmer. = 在上一次冰川作用之前，气候更温暖。
The land had been reshaped by previous glaciations. = 这片土地已经被之前的冰川作用重塑。

将来时:
Future glaciations could drastically change the planet. = 未来冰川作用可能会彻底改变地球。
Scientists will continue to study the patterns of glaciations. = 科学家们将继续研究冰川作用的模式。

虚拟语气:
If another glaciation occurred, sea levels would rise. = 如果发生另一次冰川作用，海平面将会上升。
I wish we understood the triggers of past glaciations better. = 我希望我们更好地了解过去冰川作用的触发因素。

被动语态:
The landscape was shaped by glaciation. = 地形是由冰川作用塑造的。
