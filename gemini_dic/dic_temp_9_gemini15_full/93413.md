illocality:/ˌɪləʊˈkælɪti/| n. |言语行为的言外之意，施为性|The illocality of a speech act refers to its intended effect or force.  It's what the speaker is *doing* by saying something, rather than just what the words literally mean. For example, saying "It's cold in here" might be a request to close a window, even though it's literally a statement about the temperature.  This intended effect is the illocutionary force. |The speaker's illocality was clear: she was issuing a command, not making a suggestion. =说话人的言外之意很清楚：她是在下命令，而不是提建议。|locution, perlocution|felicity conditions (in the context of speech act theory)|n.
