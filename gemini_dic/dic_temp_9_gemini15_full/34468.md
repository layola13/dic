The word "clawback" is a compound word.  "Claw" refers to the sharp, hooked nail of an animal, suggesting a forceful retrieval. "Back" implies a return or reversal.  The term likely emerged in the late 20th century, gaining traction in business and legal contexts with the increasing use of performance-based compensation.
