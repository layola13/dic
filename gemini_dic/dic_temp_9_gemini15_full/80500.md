词源:  The term is a compound of "good" (in the sense of "suitable" or "fit") and "for nothing," which implies worthlessness or lack of purpose.  The word "nothing" is used to emphasize the lack of value or usefulness.  It's a somewhat archaic expression, more common in older literature and informal speech.
