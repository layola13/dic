ellipticity:/ˌɪlɪpˈtɪsəti/| n. |椭圆率，椭圆度 | The degree to which a shape deviates from a perfect circle;  in astronomy, it refers to the ratio of the difference between the major and minor axes of an ellipse to the length of the major axis.  It's a measure of how elongated an ellipse is. | Example: The high ellipticity of the comet's orbit made it difficult to predict its return.  高椭圆率的彗星轨道使其回归难以预测。|近义词：oblateness, eccentricity (in astronomy)|反义词：circularity


USAGE->
