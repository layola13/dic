词源:

The word "fulfilled" comes from the verb "fulfil" (or "fulfill" in American English), which is derived from the Old English word "fyllan," meaning "to fill."  The prefix "ful-" means "full," and the suffix "-ed" indicates the past participle form, signifying a completed action or state. Therefore, "fulfilled" literally means "completely filled,"  but its meaning has evolved to encompass the sense of satisfaction and accomplishment associated with having one's needs or desires met.
