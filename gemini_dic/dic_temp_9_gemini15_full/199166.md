词源:

The word "silicious" is derived from the Latin word "silex," meaning "flint" or "hard stone," which itself is related to the Proto-Indo-European root "*seǵ-" meaning "to see" or "to perceive," possibly referring to the flint's striking visibility or its use in creating sparks.  The suffix "-ious" is an adjective-forming suffix indicating "full of" or "characterized by."  Thus, "silicious" means "full of silica" or "characterized by silica."
