idioplasma:/ˌɪdiˈoʊplæzəm/| n. | 特性原生质，遗传物质 | The idioplasma refers to the hereditary substance within a cell,  responsible for the transmission of inherited characteristics.  It encompasses the genes and other genetic material that determine an organism's traits.  The term is somewhat outdated, largely replaced by more precise genetic terminology. | Example:  The study of the idioplasma revealed variations in the plant's resistance to disease.  |近义词: germ plasm, genome, genotype | 反义词: phenotype (although not a direct opposite, as it represents the expressed traits rather than the genetic material itself)
