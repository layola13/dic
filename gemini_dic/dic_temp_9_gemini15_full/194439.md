词源:

The word "self-reliant" is a compound word.  "Self" is an Old English word meaning "self," while "reliant" derives from the verb "rely," which has roots in the Old French "relier" (to bind, tie up).  The "re-" prefix suggests a dependence or connection,  but "self-reliant" uses this in a context of dependence *on oneself*.  The combination thus signifies relying on one's own abilities and resources.
