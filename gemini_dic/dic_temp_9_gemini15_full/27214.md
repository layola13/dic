词源:
The word "callow" comes from the Middle English word "calu," meaning "bald," "unfledged," or "bare."  This refers to the downy feathers of a young bird, before its adult plumage develops. The implication of youth and inexperience transferred to the human sense of being immature.  The adverbial form "-ly" was added to create "callowly".
