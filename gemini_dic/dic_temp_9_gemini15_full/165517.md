词源:
The word "premaintaining" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the verb "maintaining" (meaning "keeping something in good condition").  Therefore, it literally means "maintaining before."  It's a relatively modern term, reflecting a shift towards proactive rather than reactive maintenance practices.
