词源:  The word "doquet" ultimately derives from the Old French word "doquet," meaning "small label" or "ticket."  This, in turn, is likely related to the Latin word "documenta," which means "documents" or "records."  The evolution reflects a shift from a broader sense of written record to a more specific, smaller, physical label.
