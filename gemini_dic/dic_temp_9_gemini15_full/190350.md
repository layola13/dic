The word "sarcous" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  It's possible it's:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A neologism or technical term:** It might be a newly coined word or a term used in a very specialized field (e.g., a newly discovered biological term).  If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it might be possible to provide a more accurate analysis.
* **A word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language that hasn't been fully integrated into English.


Without further information, I cannot provide the requested analysis. Please provide more context or confirm the spelling.
