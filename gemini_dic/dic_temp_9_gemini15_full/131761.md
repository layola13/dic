词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "conjecturably," which is derived from the verb "conjecture" (to guess or suppose).  "Conjecture" itself originates from the Latin word "conjectūra," meaning "a throwing together," suggesting a piecing together of evidence to form a guess.  The "-ably" suffix transforms the word into an adverbial form, which is then negated by "non-" to create the adjective "nonconjecturably".
