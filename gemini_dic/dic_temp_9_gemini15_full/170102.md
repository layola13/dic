proto-historic:/ˌproʊtoʊhɪˈstɔːrɪk/ | adj. | 史前有文字记载的；史前文明的 | Relating to a period of history for which there are some written records, but these are insufficient to provide a full and detailed account.  It bridges the gap between prehistory and history proper.  This period often involves deciphering inscriptions or interpreting archaeological findings to piece together a narrative. | Example:  The Linear A script found on Crete represents a proto-historic period; we have the script, but understanding its language remains a challenge.  史前克里特岛上发现的线形文字A代表了一个史前有文字记载的时期；我们有文字，但理解它的语言仍然是一个挑战。 | 近义词:prehistoric (but with a crucial distinction: proto-historic implies *some* written records, however limited), early historic | 反义词: fully historical, contemporary
