词源:
The word "pretended" comes from the Old French word "pretendre," meaning "to claim," "to allege," or "to intend."  This, in turn, has roots in the Latin word "prætendere," which combines the prefix "præ-" (meaning "before" or "forward") and "tendere" (meaning "to stretch" or "to extend").  The sense evolved from a claim or assertion to a false claim or a show of something not true.
