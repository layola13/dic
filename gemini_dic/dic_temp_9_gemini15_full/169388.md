pronephron:/ˈproʊnɛfrɒn/| n. |原肾|The pronephros is the first functional kidney to develop in vertebrate embryos. It is a transient structure, meaning it is only present for a short period during development and is later replaced by the mesonephros and metanephros.  The pronephros is a simple structure compared to the adult kidney, consisting of a few nephrons that filter waste products from the blood.  In some species, the pronephros may persist into adulthood, functioning as the primary excretory organ.  |Example: The pronephros in the zebrafish embryo develops early in development and plays a crucial role in maintaining osmotic balance before the mesonephros takes over.|近义词:archinephros|反义词:metanephros, mesonephros
