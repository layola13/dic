词源:
From Middle English *scalp, from Old Norse skalp "skull, head," akin to Old High German scalh "skull."  The sense of "to remove the scalp" developed later, primarily associated with Native American warfare. The modern usage of "scalp" to describe the overcharging of someone for goods or services is a figurative extension of this sense.
