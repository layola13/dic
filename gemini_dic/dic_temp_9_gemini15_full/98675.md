insulator:/ˈɪnsjʊleɪtər/ | n. |绝缘体；隔离物 | A material or substance that prevents the flow of electricity, heat, or sound.  Insulators are used in electrical systems to prevent short circuits and in buildings to improve energy efficiency. | Example: Rubber is a good insulator of electricity.  橡胶是良好的电绝缘体。  The walls of the house are well-insulated to keep it warm in winter. 房子的墙壁隔热良好，以保持冬天温暖。|近义词：isolator, dielectric |反义词：conductor


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The rubber coating acts as an insulator. = 橡胶涂层充当绝缘体。
This material is a good insulator for high voltage. = 这种材料是高压电的好绝缘体。

一般过去时:
