词源:
From Middle English *pandor, from Old French pandore, ultimately from Greek pandoura, a type of lute.  The modern meaning developed from the association of the large, unwieldy instrument with something heavy and cumbersome.  The semantic shift likely occurred because the size and weight of the instrument were salient features.
