词源:
The word "distorted" comes from the verb "distort," which in turn derives from the Latin word "distortus," the past participle of "distorquere."  "Distorquere" is a compound of "dis-" (meaning "apart" or "away") and "torquere" (meaning "to twist" or "to turn").  Therefore, the root meaning is literally "twisted apart."
