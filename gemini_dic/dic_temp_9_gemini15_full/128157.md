词源:

The word "nettled" originates from the word "nettle," a plant with stinging hairs.  The sensation of being stung by a nettle is a sharp, irritating one, and this feeling has been transferred metaphorically to describe feelings of annoyance or irritation.  The word's history traces back to Old English *nettle, related to words meaning "to sew" or "to prick."
