/ˈpoʊstræsɪlɪzəm/ | n. | 后种族主义 | The belief that racism is no longer a significant factor in society and that racial equality has been achieved.  This term is often used critically, as it ignores the continued existence of systemic racism and racial inequality.  | Example:  The idea of a "postracial America" is a myth, as evidenced by persistent racial disparities in wealth, education, and the criminal justice system.  后种族主义美国的理念是一个神话，持续存在的财富、教育和刑事司法系统中的种族差异就证明了这一点。| 近义词: colorblindness (though often used with similar critical connotations) | 反义词: racism, racial prejudice
