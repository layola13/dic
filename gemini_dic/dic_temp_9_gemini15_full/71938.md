词源:
The word "flickery" derives from the verb "flicker," which itself has Old English roots.  While a precise Old English ancestor isn't directly traceable as a single word meaning "to flicker," the sense of quick, light movement is present in related words.  The suffix "-ery" adds a sense of quality or state, thus creating the adjectival form "flickery."  The evolution reflects the gradual development of the word through Middle English and into Modern English.
