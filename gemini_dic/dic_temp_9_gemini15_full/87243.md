The word "heretoch" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or spelled word.  Could you double-check the spelling or provide more context?
* **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, a term specific to a certain community or field, or slang not yet widely recognized.
* **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language, and you've encountered it without its translation.

Please provide more information so I can assist you properly.
