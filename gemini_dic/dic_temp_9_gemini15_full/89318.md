homogeneous:/ˌhɒməˈdʒiːniəs/ /ˌhoʊmoˈdʒiːniəs/ | adj. | 同质的；均匀的；同类的 | Consisting of parts or elements of the same kind; uniform in structure or composition.

In contrast, a heterogeneous mixture, like sand and water, has visibly different parts. | The alloy is homogeneous throughout.  这个合金整体均匀一致。

The soil in this region is remarkably homogeneous.  这个地区的土壤非常均匀。|近义词：uniform, consistent, uniform, alike |反义词：heterogeneous, diverse, varied
