The word "capnomor" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specialized field, or a word from a fictional language.  To help me provide the information you need, please double-check the spelling or provide more context about where you encountered this word.
