词源:The word "elitist" emerged in the mid-20th century, combining "elite" (from the French word "élite," meaning "the best") with the suffix "-ist," indicating a person or believer in a particular system or ideology.  Thus, "elitist" describes someone who believes in or practices elitism, a system or belief that privileges a select group, often based on wealth, power, or social status.
