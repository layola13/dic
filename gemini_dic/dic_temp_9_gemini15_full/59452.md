词源:
The word "earwigged" is a relatively modern formation, derived from the noun "earwig," which itself comes from the Old English *ēarewigge, a compound of ēare ("ear") and wige ("insect").  The original meaning referred to the insect's supposed habit of crawling into people's ears.  The metaphorical extension to "secretly listening" likely arose from this association.  The "-ed" suffix transforms the noun into a past participle adjective, describing something that has been subjected to the action of earwigging (secret listening).
