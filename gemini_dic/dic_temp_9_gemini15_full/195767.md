词源:

* **semi-**:  A prefix meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."  Derived from Latin *semi*.
* **vitrified**:  Past participle of "vitrify," meaning "to convert into glass or a glassy substance by heat."  Derived from Latin *vitrum* ("glass").

用法说明:

"Semivitrified" is primarily used as an adjective to describe ceramic materials, particularly pottery and tiles.  It indicates a state where the material has undergone partial vitrification during firing.  This process increases the density, hardness, and durability of the material compared to earthenware, but it doesn't reach the complete glassy state of fully vitrified porcelain.  The degree of vitrification can vary, resulting in a range of properties within the "semivitrified" category.
