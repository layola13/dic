polymerizing: /pəˈlɪməraɪzɪŋ/ | v. | 聚合；聚合反应 | The process of combining many small molecules (monomers) to form a large molecule (polymer).  This process often involves the formation of covalent bonds between the monomers. | Example:  The monomers are polymerizing to form a long chain. 单体正在聚合形成长链。


The plastic is polymerizing in the mold. 塑料正在模具中聚合。


近义词:  polymerisation (n.),  chain reaction (in specific contexts)


反义词: depolymerizing (breaking down a polymer)


词性: 动词

PHRASE->
polymerizing process: 聚合过程
chain-growth polymerization: 链增长聚合
step-growth polymerization: 逐步聚合
cationic polymerization: 阳离子聚合
anionic polymerization: 阴离子聚合

词源:
The word "polymerizing" is derived from the word "polymer," which itself comes from the Greek words  "poly" (πολύς, meaning "many") and "meros" (μέρος, meaning "part").  Thus, "polymer" literally means "many parts," reflecting the structure of large molecules built from many smaller units.  The suffix "-izing" indicates the process of making something into a polymer.
