词源:
quasi- (拉丁语，意为“好像，似乎”) + lamented (动词lament的过去分词，意为“哀悼，惋惜”)。  The word combines the prefix "quasi," suggesting a resemblance or approximation, with the past participle "lamented," indicating a feeling of sorrow or regret.  Therefore, "quasi-lamented" describes something that resembles or mimics lament but falls short of genuine sorrow.
