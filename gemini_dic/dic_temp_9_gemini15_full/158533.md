pleonaste: /ˌpliːəˈnæstiː/ | n. |累赘的词语；冗余| A word or phrase that is redundant or unnecessary because its meaning is already included in another word or phrase in the same sentence.  It often involves using more words than necessary to express an idea.  The term comes from the Greek word for "more plentiful" or "superabundant," reflecting the excessive nature of the expression. | Example:  "A pleonasm is a type of pleonastic expression." (The word "pleonastic" is already implied by "pleonasm," making the phrase redundant.) | 近义词：redundancy, tautology, superfluity | 反义词：conciseness, brevity |


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't conjugate like a verb.  Therefore, standard tense conjugations are not applicable.  Its usage revolves around identifying and describing instances of redundancy in language.

Example 1: "The circular ring was round."  (The word "round" is redundant as a circle is inherently round.)
Example 2: "He descended down the stairs." (The word "down" is redundant as "descended" already implies downward movement.)


PHRASE->
Pleonasm is used to describe phrases, not in phrases itself in a typical grammatical sense.  The following examples show pleonastic phrases:

Example 1:  "free gift" (Gifts are inherently free).
Example 2:  "past history" (History is always in the past).
Example 3: "advance warning" (Warnings always happen in advance).
Example 4: "revert back" (To revert means to go back).
Example 5: "end result" (A result always marks the end of a process).
