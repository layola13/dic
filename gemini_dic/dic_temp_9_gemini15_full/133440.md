词源:
The word "nonfastidious" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "fastidious," which originates from the Latin word "fastidiōsus," meaning "squeamish," "dainty," or "difficult to please."  Therefore, nonfastidious literally means "not squeamish," "not dainty," or "not difficult to please," in the context of growth requirements.
