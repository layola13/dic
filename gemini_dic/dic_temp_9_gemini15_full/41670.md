correlators:/ˈkɔːrəleɪtərz/ | n. | 相关器；相关因子；关联器 | Devices or techniques used to measure the correlation between two or more signals or variables.  They are commonly used in signal processing, statistics, and other fields to identify relationships and dependencies between data sets.  For example, in radio astronomy, correlators combine signals from multiple antennas to improve the resolution of images. In statistics, correlators are used to calculate correlation coefficients, which quantify the strength and direction of linear relationships between variables. | Example:  The radio telescope uses sophisticated correlators to analyze the signals received from distant stars. = 射电望远镜使用复杂的相关器来分析从遥远恒星接收到的信号。

The experiment employed advanced correlators to identify the correlations between brain activity and behavior. = 该实验采用先进的相关器来识别大脑活动和行为之间的相关性。|  coordinators, integrators |  unrelated factors (反义词较为抽象，难以直接对应)| n.
