The term highlights the variations within a species that can be exploited for breeding or research purposes. | Example: The researchers studied the genetic diversity of IVs within the rice population. 研究人员研究了水稻群体中品种的遗传多样性。 |近义词：strains, variants, types | 反义词：homogeneity, uniformity


USAGE->
一般现在时:
These IVs show significant differences in yield. = 这些品种在产量上表现出显著差异。

一般过去时:
Researchers tested multiple IVs last year. = 研究人员去年测试了多个品种。
The experiment compared two distinct IVs. = 实验比较了两个不同的品种。


现在完成时:

将来时:
We will analyze these IVs next week. = 我们下周将分析这些品种。
The company will introduce new IVs to the market. = 公司将向市场推出新的品种。


虚拟语气:
If we had more IVs, the experiment would be more robust. = 如果我们有更多品种，实验将会更可靠。
I wish we had chosen different IVs. = 我希望我们选择了不同的品种。


被动语态:
The IVs were carefully selected for the study. = 这些品种被仔细挑选用于研究。
The genetic characteristics of the IVs are being analyzed. = 这些品种的遗传特征正在被分析。


疑问句:
Which IVs are showing the best results? = 哪些品种显示出最好的结果？
How many IVs are included in this study? = 这项研究包括多少个品种？


否定句:
These IVs did not show any significant differences. = 这些品种没有显示任何显著差异。
The experiment did not include all the available IVs. = 实验没有包含所有可用的品种。
