词源:  The word "hindrance" comes from the Old English word "hindrian," meaning "to hinder" or "to impede."  This, in turn, is related to the Proto-Germanic root "*hind-," meaning "behind" or "against."  The modern English word reflects a shift in meaning from the original sense of being behind or against something to the sense of obstructing or impeding progress.
