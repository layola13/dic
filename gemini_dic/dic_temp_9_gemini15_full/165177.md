The word "preinfers" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, I need a valid word.  If you meant a different word, or if you could provide context where you encountered "preinfers," I can offer a more accurate analysis.
