datolite:/ˈdeɪtəlaɪt/ | n. |硅硼酸钙|A hydrous calcium borosilicate mineral, often occurring in cavities in basic igneous rocks.  It is typically white, colorless, or pale green, and can be translucent or transparent. |例句：The geodes contained beautiful specimens of datolite, sparkling in the lamplight.  = 那些晶洞里装着美丽的硅硼酸钙标本，在灯光下闪闪发光。


The discovery of datolite in the basalt cavities provided valuable insights into the geological processes of the region. = 在玄武岩空洞中发现硅硼酸钙，为了解该地区的地质过程提供了宝贵的见解。|近义词： (Minerals with similar properties might be listed here, but need to be specified based on context.  Examples might include certain zeolites or other borosilicates.) |反义词： (No direct antonym exists;  perhaps a contrasting mineral type could be listed depending on context, e.g., quartz).|名词
