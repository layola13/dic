The word "neily" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (like a name), a slang term, or a word from a very niche dialect.  To provide an analysis, I need more context on where you encountered this word.
