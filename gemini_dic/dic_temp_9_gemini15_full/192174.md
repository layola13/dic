词源:  The word is a compound of "scrape" (to collect or gather with difficulty) and "penny" (a small coin). It suggests someone who painstakingly scrapes together every penny, reluctant to spend even a small amount.  The term likely emerged in the English language during a period when small coins held significant value and thriftiness was a common necessity.
