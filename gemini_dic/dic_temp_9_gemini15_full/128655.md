|Word Origin:  The word "nickname" comes from the Old English phrase "eke-name," meaning "additional name."  The "eke" part eventually evolved into "nick," possibly influenced by the word "nick" meaning "to cut or notch."  Thus, a nickname was originally an extra, sometimes playful, name added to someone's actual name.
