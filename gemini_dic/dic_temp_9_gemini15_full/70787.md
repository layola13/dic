Etymology:  The word "fingerboard" is a compound word.  "Finger" refers to the fingers used to play the instrument, and "board" refers to the flat, typically wooden surface.  The origin of both "finger" and "board" trace back to Old English: "finger" from "fingr" and "board" from "bord".  The combination to form "fingerboard" emerged naturally as a descriptive term for the instrument part.
