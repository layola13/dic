parameterizations: /ˌpəˌræmɪtrəˈzeɪʃənz/ | n. | 参数化；参数表示 | The process of representing a curve, surface, or other geometric object using parameters.  This involves expressing the coordinates of points on the object as functions of one or more independent variables, called parameters.  Different parameterizations can represent the same geometric object. For example, a circle can be parameterized using trigonometric functions, or using rational functions.  The choice of parameterization often depends on the specific application or problem being solved. | Example:  Different parameterizations of the same curve can lead to different computational complexities.  不同的曲线参数化会导致不同的计算复杂度。  The parameterizations of the surface were carefully chosen to simplify the integration. 表面参数化被仔细选择以简化积分。 |近义词：parametrizations, representations |反义词：无
