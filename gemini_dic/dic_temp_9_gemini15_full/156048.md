photoorganotrophic: /ˌfoʊtoʊˌɔːrɡænəˈtroʊfɪk/ | adj. | 光能有机营养的 | Relating to or denoting organisms that obtain energy from light and carbon from organic compounds.  These organisms utilize light as their energy source and organic molecules as their carbon source, differentiating them from photoautotrophs (which use light and inorganic carbon) and chemoorganotrophs (which use chemical energy and organic carbon).


英文解析:The term "photoorganotrophic" is a combination of three Greek roots:  "photo" (light), "organo" (organic), and "trophic" (nutrition).  It describes organisms that use light as their energy source and organic molecules as their carbon source for growth and metabolic processes.


例句:

Some purple non-sulfur bacteria are photoorganotrophic, thriving in environments with both light and organic matter.  一些紫色非硫细菌是光能有机营养的，在既有光又有有机物环境中茁壮成长。

Photoorganotrophic microorganisms play a significant role in the decomposition of organic matter in various ecosystems. 光能有机营养微生物在各种生态系统的有机物分解中起着重要作用。
