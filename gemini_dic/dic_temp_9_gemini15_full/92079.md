用法说明:

Hyperrationality is not simply being rational; it's about taking rationality to an extreme, often neglecting crucial aspects of a situation. This can manifest in various ways, such as:

* **Over-optimization:** Focusing excessively on optimizing a single metric or goal, ignoring other relevant factors.
* **Ignoring context:**  Failing to consider the larger context or broader implications of a decision.
* **Neglecting emotions:**  Dismissing or ignoring the role of emotions in decision-making.
* **Analysis paralysis:**  Becoming so bogged down in analysis that no action is taken.
* **Unintended consequences:**  Producing negative outcomes due to an overly narrow focus on rationality.


需要注意的是，"hyperrationality" 通常带有负面含义，暗示这种过度理性的行为导致了不良后果。
