1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps you could provide more context where you encountered this word.
2. **It's a neologism or slang:**  A newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.  Again, more context is needed.
3. **It's a proper noun:** Possibly a name or place name not widely known.
