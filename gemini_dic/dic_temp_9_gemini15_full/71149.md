词源:
The word "fishy" originally referred to the smell or taste of fish. Its figurative use to mean "suspicious" developed later, likely due to the association of fishiness with decay and deception.  The smell of decaying fish can be unpleasant and easily detected, mirroring how something suspicious can be easily recognized.
