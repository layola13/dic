non-stoichiometric: /ˌnɒnˌstɔɪkiəˈmɛtrɪk/ | adj. | 非化学计量的 |

英文解析:  Describing a compound in which the ratio of elements is not exactly as indicated by the simplest formula.  This deviation from the ideal stoichiometric ratio is often due to defects in the crystal structure, such as vacancies or interstitial atoms.  These defects can arise from variations in synthesis conditions or inherent instability of the ideal structure.

例句:

Many transition metal oxides exhibit non-stoichiometric behavior.  许多过渡金属氧化物表现出非化学计量行为。

The sample showed non-stoichiometric composition due to oxygen deficiency. 样品由于缺氧而表现出非化学计量组成。


近义词:  non-integral,  defective (in the context of crystal structure)
