The word "gogglier" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very niche dialect or jargon.  Therefore, I cannot provide a complete analysis following your requested format.  To help, I need more context: Where did you encounter this word?  What was the surrounding text?
