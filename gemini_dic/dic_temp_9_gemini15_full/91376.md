hydrosulphuret:/ˌhaɪdroʊˈsʌlfjʊreɪt/ | n. |硫氢化物|A hydrosulphuret is a compound containing the hydrosulfide ion (HS−).  It is an older term, now largely replaced by "hydrosulfide".  These compounds are typically formed by the reaction of a sulfide with hydrogen sulfide.  They often exhibit a strong sulfurous odor.|例句：The old text mentions the preparation of a hydrosulphuret of potassium. = 旧文本提到制备硫氢化钾的方法。The analysis revealed the presence of a hydrosulphuret in the sample. = 分析表明样品中存在硫氢化物。|近义词：hydrosulfide|反义词：无
