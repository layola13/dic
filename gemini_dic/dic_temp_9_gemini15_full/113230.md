词源:  Derived from Latin *lusorius, from *lusus, the past participle of ludere ("to play").  The suffix "-orius" indicates something pertaining to or relating to.  Therefore, lusorious literally means "relating to play" or "of or pertaining to play".


用法说明:

lusorious is primarily an adjective and is used to describe people, animals, or activities that are playful or full of fun. It's not a frequently used word in modern English, carrying a slightly archaic or literary feel.  It suggests a more refined and perhaps less boisterous playfulness than words like "frolicsome".  It's often used to evoke a sense of lightheartedness and amusement, particularly in a slightly formal or literary context.
