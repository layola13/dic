/ˈsiːzəm/ | n. |  变异，多样性；[生物]多型现象 | The study of variation in phenotype due to environmental factors.  Psephism is the study of how environmental factors influence the expression of genes, leading to phenotypic variation within a population. It emphasizes the role of environmental influences in shaping individual characteristics. |  The psephism of butterfly wing patterns is influenced by temperature and humidity. 蝴蝶翅膀图案的多样性受温度和湿度影响。| polymorphism, phenotypic plasticity | genetic homogeneity | 名词
