nitrifier:/ˈnaɪtrɪfaɪər/| n.|硝化细菌|A nitrifier is a bacterium that converts ammonia to nitrite or nitrite to nitrate during the nitrogen cycle.  Nitrifiers are essential for the nitrogen cycle, a crucial biogeochemical process that makes nitrogen available to plants and other organisms. They are chemoautotrophs, meaning they obtain energy from chemical reactions rather than sunlight.|例句：Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria are types of nitrifiers. 氨氧化细菌和亚硝酸盐氧化细菌是硝化细菌的两种类型。

Nitrifying bacteria play a vital role in wastewater treatment plants. 硝化细菌在污水处理厂中发挥着至关重要的作用。|近义词：nitrogen-fixing bacteria (部分功能重叠)|反义词：denitrifier (执行相反的功能)|名词
