词源:
The word "competed" comes from the Latin word "competere," which means "to be suitable, to be fit," "to strive together," or "to contend."  The prefix "com-" indicates "together" and the root "-petere" relates to "seeking" or "striving."  Over time, the meaning evolved to emphasize the striving against others.
