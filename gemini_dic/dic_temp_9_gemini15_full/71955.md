The word "flighter" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following your requested format.  To help you, I need clarification:

* **Is this a misspelling?**  Could you be thinking of a similar word, such as "fighter," "flier," or "flight"?  Providing the context in which you encountered this word would be extremely helpful.

* **Is this a newly coined word?** If so, in what context was it used? Knowing the intended meaning would allow for a better understanding and potential analysis.


Once you provide more information, I can offer a more accurate response.
