/ˌoʊvərˈvæljəntnəsəz/ | n. |过分勇敢；过度勇猛|Extremely excessive bravery or valor; often to a point of recklessness or foolishness.  The word is extremely rare and largely artificial,  formed by combining "over-" (excessive) with "valiant" (brave) and adding the plural "-nesses". It lacks common usage and feels awkward in most contexts.  |  His overvaliantnesses led him into unnecessary danger.  他的过分勇敢使他陷入不必要的危险之中。 |  bravery, valor, courage, heroism | cowardice, timidity, fearfulness|名词
