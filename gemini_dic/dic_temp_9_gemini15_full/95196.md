反义词：auspicious, favorable, fortunate, propitious


词源:  The word is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "auspicious," which comes from the Latin "auspex," meaning "observer of birds."  Ancient Romans believed that observing the flight of birds could predict the future, so "auspicious" originally meant "marked by favorable omens."  Therefore, "inauspicious" signifies the opposite—marked by unfavorable omens or signs.
