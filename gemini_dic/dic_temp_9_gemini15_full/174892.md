词源:  The word "rack" ultimately derives from Old Norse *rakki, meaning a "rack," "framework," or "carriage."  Its evolution through Middle English and Old French solidified its meaning related to frameworks and structures.  The sense of "torture device" is a later development, linked to the imagery of stretching and straining a body on a framework.
