/ˌaɪsoʊˈplæstɪk/ | adj. | 同质的，等塑性的 |  Relating to or denoting materials that have the same plastic properties in all directions.  This term is primarily used in materials science and engineering, referring to materials that exhibit isotropic behavior in their plastic deformation.  Isotropic materials deform equally in all directions when subjected to stress. | The isoplastic behavior of the polymer was confirmed through tensile testing.  该聚合物的等塑性行为通过拉伸试验得到证实。 | isotropic, homogeneous | anisotropic | 形容词
