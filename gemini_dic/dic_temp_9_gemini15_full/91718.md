词源:  The word "hypercritical" combines the prefix "hyper-" (meaning "excessive" or "over") with "critical" (meaning "expressing adverse or disapproving comments or judgments").  Therefore, it literally means "excessively critical."  The root of "critical" traces back to the Greek word "kritikos," meaning "able to judge," related to "krinein," meaning "to separate," "to decide," or "to judge."
