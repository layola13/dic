The word "monochromous" comes from the Greek words:

* **mono- (μονό-)**: meaning "one," "single," or "alone."
* **chroma (χρῶμα)**: meaning "color."
* **-ous**: a suffix forming adjectives, meaning "full of," "possessing," or "having the quality of."


Therefore, "monochromous" literally means "having one color."
