USAGE->
This word is highly specialized and doesn't lend itself to common grammatical examples in the same way as a word like "what."  The usage is almost exclusively within the context of ophthalmology and related medical fields.  Grammatical constructions would mirror standard adjective usage.  For example:


The hypohyal space is important to consider during surgery.  = 手术中需考虑玻璃体下间隙。

A hypohyal detachment was observed. = 观察到玻璃体下脱离。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "hypohyal". The term is purely descriptive within its specific medical domain.
