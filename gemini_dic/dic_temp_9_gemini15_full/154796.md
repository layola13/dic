现在完成时:
The upgrades have reduced perturbabilities. = 升级降低了可扰动性。
We have observed increased perturbabilities recently. = 最近我们观察到可扰动性增加了。


过去完成时:
The system's perturbabilities had already been identified. = 系统的可扰动性已被识别。
They had not anticipated such high perturbabilities. = 他们没有预料到如此高的可扰动性。


将来时:
The new design will reduce perturbabilities. = 新的设计将降低可扰动性。
We will analyze the perturbabilities further. = 我们将进一步分析可扰动性。


虚拟语气:
If the perturbabilities were lower, the results would be more accurate. = 如果可扰动性更低，结果将更准确。

否定句:
The perturbabilities were not significant enough to affect the outcome. = 可扰动性不足以影响结果。
The system did not show any unexpected perturbabilities. = 系统没有显示任何意外的可扰动性。


PHRASE->
high perturbabilities = 高可扰动性
low perturbabilities = 低可扰动性
reduce perturbabilities = 降低可扰动性
measure perturbabilities = 测量可扰动性
analyze perturbabilities = 分析可扰动性


词源：
perturbability 来自于动词 perturb (扰乱，使不安)，加上-ability（能力，性）构成。 perturb  源自拉丁语 perturbare，由 per (完全地) + turbare (扰乱) 组成。
