hypoxia:/haɪˈpɒksiə/ | n. | 缺氧；低氧血症 | A condition in which the body or a region of the body is deprived of adequate oxygen supply at the tissue level.  This can be due to reduced oxygen in the air, reduced blood flow, or inability of the blood to carry oxygen. | Example:  High-altitude hypoxia can cause altitude sickness. 高原缺氧会导致高原反应。


Example: Patients with severe pneumonia may experience hypoxia.  严重肺炎患者可能会出现缺氧。


近义词: anoxia, oxygen deficiency | 反义词: hyperoxia


词源:  From hypo- (meaning "under" or "deficient") + -oxia (meaning "oxygen").  The term combines a prefix indicating deficiency with a suffix referring to oxygen, thus literally meaning "deficient in oxygen."
