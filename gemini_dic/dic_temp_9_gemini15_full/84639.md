The phrase "hand-over-fist" originates from the imagery of climbing a rope.  Imagine someone climbing a rope very quickly; their hands would move over the rope and their fists would follow, creating a quick, continuous motion. This visual metaphor translates to rapid and significant progress or increase.  While the precise etymological origins are difficult to pinpoint to a specific date or text, the usage aligns with nautical contexts where climbing ropes was common.
