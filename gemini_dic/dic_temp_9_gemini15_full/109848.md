词源:  The word "lexiphanic" is a relatively modern coinage. It is derived from the Greek words "lexi-" (meaning "word" or "vocabulary") and "-phanic" (related to "phainein," meaning "to show" or "to appear").  Therefore, the word literally means "showing off words" or "displaying vocabulary."  Its modern usage, however, emphasizes the negative connotation of using overly complicated language for the sake of appearing intelligent.
