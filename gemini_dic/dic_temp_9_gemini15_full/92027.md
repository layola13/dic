词源：

* **hyper-**:  prefix meaning "excessive," "above," or "beyond."  (来自希腊语 ὑπέρ,  hupér,  meaning "over," "above," "beyond")

* **partisan-**: relating to or characteristic of a partisan (a strong supporter of a party, cause, or person).  (源自法语 partisan,  ultimately from the Latin *pars*, meaning "part")

* **-ship**: suffix denoting "state," "condition," or "quality." (源自古英语 *scipe)


因此，hyperpartisanship字面意思是“过度的党派性”，表示一种极端的党派忠诚，常常以牺牲妥协和有效治理为代价。
