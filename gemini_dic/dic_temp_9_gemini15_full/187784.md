词源:

The word "rorid" ultimately derives from the Latin word "rosidus," meaning "dewy," "covered with dew," or "rosy."  Over time, the meaning shifted from the literal "dewy" to the figurative sense of "bright," "shining," and eventually to the connotations of excessive ornamentation and gaudiness.  This semantic shift likely occurred because the glistening effect of dew was associated with bright, showy colors.
