semi-convergent:/ˌsɛmiˈkɒnvɜːdʒənt/| adj.|半收敛的|Relating to or characterized by a sequence or series that converges in some sense but not in the usual sense of absolute convergence.  A semi-convergent series is an infinite series that converges, but its absolute value diverges.  This means the sum of the series approaches a finite limit, but the sum of the absolute values of its terms does not. |Example: The alternating harmonic series (1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 + ...) is a classic example of a semi-convergent series.  It converges to ln 2, but the series of absolute values (1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ...) diverges.  |近义词:conditionally convergent|反义词:absolutely convergent, divergent|


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in mathematical contexts, particularly in the study of infinite series and sequences.  Therefore, grammatical examples in the traditional tenses are not directly applicable.  Instead, here are examples demonstrating its usage in mathematical explanations and discussions:


Example 1:
"The series exhibits semi-convergent behavior, meaning it converges to a limit but not absolutely." = 该级数表现出半收敛行为，这意味着它收敛到一个极限，但不是绝对收敛。


Example 2:
"We proved that the integral is semi-convergent under certain conditions." = 我们证明了在特定条件下积分是半收敛的。


Example 3 (Illustrating the difference):
"While the series Σ(-1)^n/n is semi-convergent, the series Σ|(-1)^n/n| is divergent." = 虽然级数Σ(-1)^n/n是半收敛的，但级数Σ|(-1)^n/n|是发散的。


Example 4 (Illustrating rearrangement):
"Rearranging the terms of a semi-convergent series can alter its sum." =  重新排列半收敛级数的项可以改变其和。


PHRASE->

There are no common idiomatic phrases using "semi-convergent".  The term is highly technical and confined to mathematical discourse.
