词源:

The word "firearm" is a compound word.  It combines "fire," referring to the ignition of gunpowder, and "arm," referring to a weapon or instrument of war.  The word's history reflects the development of gunpowder weapons, tracing back to the late Middle Ages when gunpowder weaponry emerged as a significant force on the battlefield.  The exact etymology is complex and evolves over time, but the core elements of "fire" and "arm" clearly indicate its function and purpose.
