quanta:/ˈkwɑːntə/|/ˈkwɒntə/| n. |量子；量；一定数量|A quantum is the minimum amount of any physical entity involved in an interaction.  It is a discrete unit that cannot be further divided.  In physics, this refers to fundamental quantities such as energy or momentum.|Example:  The energy of a photon is quantized, meaning it exists in discrete quanta.  光子的能量是量子化的，这意味着它以离散的量子存在。|近义词：amount, quantity, portion|反义词：continuum


USAGE->
一般现在时:
A single photon carries one quantum of energy. = 单个光子携带一个能量量子。
The system operates in discrete quanta. = 系统以离散的量子运行。

一般过去时:
Scientists measured the quanta of light. = 科学家测量了光的量子。
They observed the emission of quanta. = 他们观察到量子的发射。

现在完成时:
Researchers have discovered new properties of quanta. = 研究人员已经发现了量子的新特性。
Physicists have studied quanta for over a century. = 物理学家已经研究量子超过一个世纪了。

过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had calculated the expected number of quanta. = 实验之前，他们已经计算出预期的量子数。
They had not fully understood the nature of quanta before the breakthrough. = 在突破之前，他们还没有完全理解量子的本质。

将来时:
Future experiments will explore the behavior of quanta in extreme conditions. = 未来实验将探索量子在极端条件下的行为。
Scientists will likely discover more about quanta in the coming years. = 科学家们可能会在未来几年内发现更多关于量子的知识。

虚拟语气:
If we knew the exact position of a quantum, we could predict its momentum. = 如果我们知道量子的确切位置，我们就可以预测它的动量。(海森堡不确定性原理对此有所限制)
It is as if the universe operates in discrete quanta. = 就好像宇宙以离散的量子运行。

被动语态:
The quanta were detected by a sensitive instrument. = 量子被灵敏的仪器探测到。
The energy levels are quantized, meaning they exist in discrete quanta. = 能量级别是量子化的，这意味着它们以离散的量子存在。

疑问句:
How many quanta are involved in this reaction? = 这个反应涉及多少量子？
What is the nature of the quanta of gravity? = 引力量子的本质是什么？

否定句:
The energy is not continuous; it exists in quanta. = 能量不是连续的；它以量子形式存在。
They did not observe any unexpected quanta during the experiment. = 他们在实验中没有观察到任何意外的量子。
