The word "regredience" is not a commonly used word in modern English.  It's primarily found in older texts or specialized scientific contexts.  Therefore, providing extensive grammatical examples as requested for a common word like "what" is not applicable.  The following information is based on its understood meaning and structure.


英文解析:  Regredience refers to the act or process of going back, returning to a previous state, or reverting. It implies a movement backwards, a reversal of a previous trend or condition.  It can be applied to various contexts, including physical processes, medical conditions, or even social trends.

例句:

The patient experienced a temporary regredience of symptoms before full recovery. 病人在完全康复之前经历了暂时的症状恢复。


词源: The word is derived from the Latin prefix "re-" (back, again) and "gredi" (to go, to walk, to step).  Therefore, it literally means "going back."


用法说明:  Because of its low frequency of use, there isn't a wide range of grammatical applications to demonstrate.  However, it can function as the subject or object of a sentence, and can be modified by adverbs or adjectives.  For example:


A slow regredience was observed. (Subject)


The doctor noted the rapid regredience of the infection. (Object)
