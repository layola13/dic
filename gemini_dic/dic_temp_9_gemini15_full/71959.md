Etymology:  Derived from the adjective "flighty," which itself originates from "fly" (to move quickly and lightly in the air). The "-iness" suffix adds the quality or state of being flighty.  The sense evolved from the literal movement of a bird to a metaphorical description of erratic or irresponsible behavior.
