seiches:/seɪʃz/| n.| 静振波，湖泊地震波 |Standing waves in an enclosed or partially enclosed body of water, typically caused by seismic activity, wind, or atmospheric pressure changes.  They can be dangerous due to their unpredictable nature and sudden rise in water level.| 例句：The earthquake triggered destructive seiches in the lake.  地震引发了湖中破坏性的静振波。

The strong winds generated sizable seiches along the coastline. 强风在海岸线上产生了相当大的静振波。


近义词：standing wave, harbor wave|反义词：无
