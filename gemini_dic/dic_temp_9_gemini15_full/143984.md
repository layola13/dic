词源:

The word "outrank" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "surpass" or "exceed") and the verb "rank" (meaning "to hold a certain position in a hierarchy").  Therefore, "outrank" literally means "to surpass in rank."  The word's origin traces back to the Old French word "ranc," meaning "row" or "line," eventually evolving to its modern meaning of hierarchical position.
