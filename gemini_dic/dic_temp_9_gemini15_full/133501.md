/ˌnɒnfɜːˈtɪlɪtiz/ | n. |不育症，生育力低下 | The word "nonfertilities" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling of "infertility" or a related term.  It would be understood contextually to mean the absence or impairment of fertility.  There are no standard examples, synonyms, or antonyms as it's not a recognized word. Because it is not a standard word, providing grammar examples is not possible.  |近义词: infertility, sterility |反义词: fertility
