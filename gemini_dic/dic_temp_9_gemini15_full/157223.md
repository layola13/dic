词源:
Pinknesses is derived from the adjective "pink," ultimately tracing back to Middle English "pinke," referring to a flower (possibly the carnation) with a pink color.  The "-ness" suffix indicates a state, quality, or condition. Therefore, pinknesses denotes the state or quality of being pink, or the collection of different shades and intensities of pink.
