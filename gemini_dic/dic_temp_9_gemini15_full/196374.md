From "sermon" + "-ic".  "Sermon" ultimately derives from the Old French "sermon," from the Late Latin "sermo," meaning "speech, discourse, conversation."


用法说明：

Sermonic is primarily used to describe something that resembles a sermon in style or content.  This often implies a tone that is moralizing, preachy, or overly didactic. It can also be used to describe something that is excessively long and tedious, like a long-winded and boring lecture.  The word carries a slightly negative connotation, suggesting that the subject matter is being presented in a heavy-handed or unengaging way.
