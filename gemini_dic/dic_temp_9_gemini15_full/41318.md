/ˌkoʊrɛfəˈrɛnʃiˈæləti/ | n. | 指代性，共指性 | The property of two or more linguistic expressions referring to the same entity.  This is a key concept in linguistics and computational linguistics, particularly in the study of anaphora resolution.  Coreferentiality exists when two or more expressions in a text or discourse refer to the same real-world entity or concept.  For example, in the sentence "John saw Mary, and he waved at her," "John," "he," and "Mary," and "her" are coreferential.  The analysis of coreferentiality is crucial for natural language understanding and machine translation. | Example: The analysis of coreferentiality is crucial for natural language processing.  共指性分析对于自然语言处理至关重要。 The pronoun "he" in the sentence "John went to the store, and he bought milk" is coreferential with "John".  句子中代词“he”与“John”是共指的。 |近义词: reference, identity, co-reference | 反义词: non-coreference, distinct reference |  N/A
