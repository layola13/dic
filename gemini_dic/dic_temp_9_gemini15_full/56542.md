词源:

The word "dominative" derives from the Latin word "dominātus," the past participle of "dominārī," meaning "to be master of," "to rule," or "to own."  The root is "dominus," meaning "master" or "lord."  The suffix "-ive" forms adjectives indicating a tendency or capacity.  Therefore, "dominative" literally means "having the quality of a master" or "tending to dominate."
