词源:

The word "prejudicially" derives from the adjective "prejudicial," which in turn comes from the Latin word "praejudicium."  "Prae" means "before" or "in advance," and "judicium" means "judgment."  Therefore, the original meaning implied a judgment made before having all the facts, leading to bias or harm.  The "-ally" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, modifying verbs and describing how an action is performed.
