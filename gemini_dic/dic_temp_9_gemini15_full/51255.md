desublimates:/ˌdɛˌsʌblɪˈmeɪt/| v.|升华(逆过程)|To undergo desublimation; to pass from the gaseous or vapor state directly to the solid state, without passing through the liquid state.  The process is the reverse of sublimation.  It's often used in chemistry and physics to describe the deposition of a solid from a gas. |例句：The water vapor desublimated on the cold surface, forming frost.  水蒸气在冰冷的表面上发生逆升华，形成了霜。

The iodine desublimated in the cool air, forming beautiful purple crystals.碘在凉爽的空气中发生逆升华，形成美丽的紫色晶体。|近义词：deposit (in this specific context)|反义词：sublime|词性:verb


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The water vapor desublimates on cold surfaces. = 水蒸气在冰冷的表面上发生逆升华。
Iodine desublimates when cooled rapidly. = 碘在快速冷却时发生逆升华。

一般过去时:
The water vapor desublimated on the windowpane overnight. = 水蒸气一夜之间在窗玻璃上发生了逆升华。
The iodine desublimated and formed crystals. = 碘发生了逆升华并形成了晶体。

现在完成时:
Frost has desublimated on the car windshield. = 霜已在汽车挡风玻璃上发生了逆升华。
The experiment has shown that the substance desublimates under these conditions. = 实验表明该物质在这种条件下会发生逆升华。

过去完成时:
The frost had desublimated before the sun rose. = 霜在太阳升起之前就已经发生了逆升华。
The scientists had observed that the substance desublimated at low temperatures. = 科学家们已经观察到该物质在低温下会发生逆升华。

将来时:
The water vapor will desublimate if the temperature drops significantly. = 如果温度大幅下降，水蒸气将会发生逆升华。
The researchers predict that the compound will desublimate during the experiment. = 研究人员预测该化合物在实验过程中将会发生逆升华。

虚拟语气:
If the temperature were lower, the gas would desublimate more readily. = 如果温度更低，气体将更容易发生逆升华。
It would be interesting to see if this substance desublimates under different pressures. = 看看这种物质在不同的压力下是否会发生逆升华将会很有趣。

被动语态:
The frost was desublimated from the cold air. = 霜是从冷空气中逆升华而成的。(This is less common usage, as desublimation is typically a natural process)
The crystals were formed as the substance desublimated. = 当物质发生逆升华时，晶体形成了。(This focuses on the result rather than the process itself)

疑问句:
Does the water vapor desublimate easily under these conditions? = 在这些条件下，水蒸气容易发生逆升华吗？
Will the substance desublimate if the pressure is increased? = 如果增加压力，这种物质会发生逆升华吗？

否定句:
The water vapor did not desublimate because the surface was too warm. = 因为表面太暖和，水蒸气没有发生逆升华。
The substance did not desublimate at room temperature. = 该物质在室温下没有发生逆升华。


PHRASE->
There are limited common phrases directly using "desublimate" due to its specialized scientific usage.  The focus would be on the result of desublimation rather than the verb itself.  For example:


frost formation through desublimation = 通过逆升华形成霜
crystals formed by desublimation = 通过逆升华形成的晶体
desublimation process = 逆升华过程
rate of desublimation = 逆升华速率
conditions for desublimation = 逆升华条件
