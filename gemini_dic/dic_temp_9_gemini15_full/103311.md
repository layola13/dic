词源:
The word "jigged" comes from the Middle English word "jiggen," meaning "to dance." This in turn is likely of uncertain origin, possibly related to other words suggesting a quick, jerky movement.  The connection to dancing is central to the word's development, with the meaning expanding to include other forms of quick, irregular movement.
