The word "sanes" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It might be:

1. A misspelling:  Perhaps you meant "sane" (meaning mentally healthy) or a similar word.
2. A neologism: A newly coined word not yet widely accepted.
3. A technical term: Specific to a particular field or jargon.
4. Part of a proper noun:  Possibly a name or place.


To provide an analysis in the requested format, I need the correct word or more context.  Please clarify the word you intended to use.
