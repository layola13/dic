词源:

The word "premustering" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the noun "mustering," which itself derives from the verb "muster."  "Muster" comes from the Old French word "mostrer," meaning "to show," and ultimately from the Latin word "monstrare," also meaning "to show" or "to demonstrate."  In the context of premustering, the "showing" refers to the assembling and accounting for individuals or units.
