词源:
From the adjective "oppressive," which comes from the verb "oppress," meaning "to subject to cruel or unjust treatment, or to weigh down." The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb, modifying verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs.  "Oppress" itself has roots in Latin: "opprimere," which combines "ob-" (against) and "premere" (to press).
