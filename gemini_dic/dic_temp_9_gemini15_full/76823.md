词源:

The word "ganancial" originates from the Spanish word  "ganancia," meaning "gain" or "profit."  It's ultimately derived from the Latin word "gānāre," meaning "to earn" or "to gain."  The "-al" suffix transforms the noun "ganancia" into an adjectival form, often used to describe property or income acquired during marriage within a community property system.  The term carries a strong legal connotation, especially in Spanish-speaking regions with community property laws.
