词源:

The word "palaverist" is derived from "palaver," which itself has a complex etymology.  "Palaver" entered English from Portuguese *palavra ("word"), ultimately from Latin *parabolare ("to speak").  In the 16th century, it was initially used in reference to discussions, often lengthy and sometimes deceitful, between Europeans and African peoples. It later took on the connotation of idle or excessive talk. Adding "-ist" creates the noun meaning "one who engages in palaver."
