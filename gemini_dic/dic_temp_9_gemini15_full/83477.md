The word "hack-it" does not exist as a single, established word in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a combination of "hack" and "it," functioning as a phrasal verb or a slang term.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested for a standard word is not possible.  However, we can analyze the individual components and provide possible interpretations of its usage.

**hack-it (Possible Interpretations):**

Given the components, "hack-it" likely means one of the following, depending on the context:

1. **To quickly create or fix something:**  This implies a rushed, perhaps imperfect solution.  Similar to "knocking something together."

例句：
"I didn't have time to write proper code, so I just hack-it together." = 我没有时间编写合适的代码，所以我只是快速地拼凑了一下。

"Let's hack-it and get it working for now." = 让我们先把它弄好，暂时用着。



2. **To hack into something specific:**  This is a more technical interpretation, referring to unauthorized access to a particular system or file.

例句：

"They hack-it to steal customer data." = 他们入侵它以窃取客户数据。


3. **A slang term for a quick fix or solution:** This is informal usage, often found in casual conversation.

例句：
"That's a real hack-it, but it works." = 这是一个真正的粗制滥造的东西，但是它能用。

"This design is a bit of a hack-it, but it's functional." = 这个设计有点粗糙，但它能用。


**USAGE, PHRASE, etc.  are not applicable to "hack-it" in the same way as for established words.**  The grammatical functions and phrases depend entirely on the intended meaning and context of its use within a sentence.  Since "hack-it" is not a standard word,  providing comprehensive grammatical examples as per the format would be artificial and misleading.
