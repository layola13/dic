dermobranchiate:/ˌdɜːrməˈbræŋkieɪt/| adj.|具皮肤鳃的；皮肤鳃的 |Having gills located in or on the skin.  This term is primarily used in zoology to describe certain aquatic larval forms of amphibians and some other animals that respire through their skin. The gills are not enclosed within a gill chamber as in fish, but are external or embedded within the skin.  |例句：The larval stage of this amphibian is dermobranchiate, absorbing oxygen directly through its skin.  这种两栖动物的幼体期是具皮肤鳃的，直接通过皮肤吸收氧气。

The dermobranchiate larvae of this species are easily distinguishable by their bright coloration.  这个物种的具皮肤鳃的幼虫很容易通过其鲜艳的色彩来区分。


近义词：cutaneous-breathing (referring to respiration through the skin),  gill-bearing (but this is less specific)


反义词：branchial (referring to gills within a gill chamber, as in fish),  pulmonate (lung-breathing)

The researchers have confirmed that the species is dermobranchiate. = 研究人员已经证实该物种是具皮肤鳃的。
Scientists have observed dermobranchiate development in several amphibian species. = 科学家们已经在几种两栖动物物种中观察到具皮肤鳃的发育。


过去完成时:
The scientists had already determined that the organism was dermobranchiate before conducting further analysis. = 科学家们在进行进一步分析之前就已经确定该生物是具皮肤鳃的。
It had been previously believed that the species was not dermobranchiate. = 以前人们认为该物种不是具皮肤鳃的。

被动语态:
The dermobranchiate nature of the species was confirmed by the study. = 该物种的具皮肤鳃的特性得到了研究的证实。
The presence of dermobranchiate larvae was noted in the area. = 在该区域注意到存在具皮肤鳃的幼虫。


疑问句:
Is this species dermobranchiate? = 这个物种是具皮肤鳃的吗？
Are the larvae dermobranchiate at this stage of development? = 在这个发育阶段，幼虫是具皮肤鳃的吗？


否定句:
The adult form is not dermobranchiate. = 成年期不是具皮肤鳃的。
