词源:
The word "drayman" is derived from "dray" + "-man".  "Dray" itself comes from the Middle English word "dray," meaning "a sledge or cart," ultimately of uncertain origin, possibly related to Old English words connected with dragging or drawing.  The suffix "-man" indicates a person who works with or operates a dray.
