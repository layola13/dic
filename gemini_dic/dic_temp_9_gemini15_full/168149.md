WORD ORIGIN->

The term is a compound word.

* **pro-**:  A prefix meaning "in favor of," "supporting," or "advocating."  It has Latin origins.

* **Bolsheviki**:  The plural form of "Bolshevik," referring to members of the majority faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, led by Vladimir Lenin.  The name derives from the Russian word  "большинство" (bolshinstvo), meaning "majority."

Therefore, "pro-Bolsheviki" literally means "in favor of the majority" (in the context of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party), but its meaning is more precisely "supporting the Bolsheviks."
