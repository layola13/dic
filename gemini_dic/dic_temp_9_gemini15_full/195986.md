WORD ORIGIN->
The word "sententiousnesses" is derived from the adjective "sententious," which comes from the Latin word "sententia," meaning "sentence," "opinion," "maxim," or "proverb." The "-ous" suffix turns it into an adjective, and "-ness" adds the noun suffix, creating "sententiousness." The addition of "-es" creates the plural form.  Therefore, the word's root lies in the concept of expressing opinions or moral lessons in a concise, often preachy manner.
