The word "houndier" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage examples cannot be provided.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very niche dialect.

To help, you might consider:

* **Checking for spelling errors:**  Did you intend to write a different word?  Perhaps a word similar in sound or meaning?
* **Providing context:** Where did you encounter this word? Knowing the source might help determine its meaning.
* **Considering potential roots:** If it's a neologism, what words might it be derived from?  The word "hound" is a possibility, suggesting a connection to dogs or perhaps a relentless pursuit.  The "-ier" suffix often indicates a comparative or superlative adjective (e.g., happier, stronger).

Without more information, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.
