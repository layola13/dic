词源:
The word "ennoble" comes from the Old French word "ennoblir," which is a combination of the prefix "en-" (meaning "in" or "to") and "noblir" (meaning "to make noble").  Ultimately, "noblir" traces back to the Latin word "nobilis," meaning "noble," which is related to the Latin word "noscere," meaning "to know."  This reflects the historical association of nobility with being well-known and of high social standing.
