The word is a compound of "counter" (meaning "against" or "in opposition to") and "interrogation" (the process of questioning someone).  Both elements have Latin roots.  "Counter" derives ultimately from the Latin "contra," meaning "against," while "interrogation" comes from the Latin "interrogatio," a combination of "inter" ("between") and "rogare" ("to ask").
