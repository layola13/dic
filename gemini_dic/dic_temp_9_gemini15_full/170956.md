The word "pseudopatriotic" is a compound word.  It combines:

* **pseudo-:**  From Greek *pseudēs*, meaning "false" or "sham."
* **patriotic:** From "patriot," ultimately deriving from Latin *pater* ("father"), referring to one's love and devotion to one's country (considered as a fatherland).

Therefore, "pseudopatriotic" literally means "falsely patriotic."
