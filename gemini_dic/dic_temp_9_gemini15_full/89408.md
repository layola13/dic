homotaxis:/ˌhoʊmoʊˈtæksɪs/| n. |同向性，同序性 |The arrangement of rock strata in a geographically widespread area, such that the same sequence of strata occurs in the same relative order.  This indicates that the strata were deposited at roughly the same time across a wide region, despite local variations in lithology.  Homotaxis is an important concept in stratigraphy, the study of rock layers and their formation. | Example: The discovery of homotaxis in these geographically distant formations suggests they were deposited during a similar geological period.  同向性在这些地理位置遥远的岩层中的发现表明它们是在相似的地质时期沉积的。|近义词：correlation, contemporaneity |反义词：heterotaxis
