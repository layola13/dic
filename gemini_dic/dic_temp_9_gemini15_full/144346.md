outstartled:  /ˌaʊtˈstɑːrtld/ | adj. | 受惊吓的；吓了一跳的 |  Surprised and startled; frightened suddenly.  This word is not a standard English word and is likely a misspelling or a neologism.  It combines the prefix "out-" (meaning exceeding or surpassing) with "startled".  The meaning would imply a degree of surprise or fright exceeding a normal startle. However, its lack of common usage limits its practical application.
