词源:  The word "mightly" is an adverb derived from the adjective "mighty," meaning powerful or strong.  "Mighty" itself comes from the Old English "mihtig," which combines "miht" (might, strength, power) and the adjective suffix "-ig." The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating manner or degree.


用法说明:

"Mightly" is an archaic or dialectal word. While grammatically correct, it's considered less formal and more emphatic than other adverbs like "very" or "extremely." Its use adds a strong sense of force or intensity to the description.  It is more common in informal writing or speech, and its use should be considered carefully based on the context to avoid sounding overly informal or dated.  In many modern contexts, synonyms like "extremely" or "powerfully" would be preferred.
