USAGE->
This word is relatively uncommon and primarily used to emphasize multiple facets of health.  Therefore, standard tense conjugations are less relevant.  It functions similarly to other plural nouns.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "healthinesses".  The word itself is unusual.  Phrases would be built around the concept of health, not the plural form.  For instance:


good health
poor health
mental health
physical health
overall health
