词源:

The word "disfranchise" is derived from the Old French word "desfrancher," which means "to free from a franchise."  "Franchise" itself comes from Old French, ultimately from the late Latin *francisca,  meaning "freedom," "privilege," or "immunity". The prefix "dis-" means "to deprive of" or "to remove".  Therefore, "disfranchise" literally means "to deprive of freedom" or "to deprive of a right or privilege".
