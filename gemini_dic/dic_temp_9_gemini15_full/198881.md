词源:
The word "sidetracking" is a combination of "side" and "tracking".  "Side" refers to something off to the side or away from the main course, and "tracking" refers to following a path or course.  Therefore, sidetracking literally means following a path that is off to the side, away from the main route or goal.  The verb usage evolved from the original literal meaning of a train or vehicle leaving its intended track.
