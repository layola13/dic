recursivity:/ˌriːkɜːˈsɪvɪti/ | n. | 递归性，递归；自反性 | The quality or state of being recursive; a process that repeats itself.  Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science and mathematics, referring to a process where a function calls itself. It's also used in linguistics to describe the self-referential nature of certain grammatical structures. | Example: The program demonstrated elegant recursivity in its solution to the maze.  这个程序用其解决迷宫的方法展现了优雅的递归性。 |近义词: recursion, self-reference, iteration | 反义词: iteration (in some contexts, as iteration can be a non-recursive alternative) | 名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The function exhibits recursivity. = 这个函数表现出递归性。
