It is typically more viscous than the endoplasm and often contains contractile fibrils.  |Example: The amoeba extended its ectosarc to engulf the food particle.  变形虫伸出其外质吞噬食物颗粒。|近义词:ectoplasm, plasmagel|反义词:endoplasm, plasmasol


USAGE->
一般现在时:

The ectosarc protects the cell from external threats. = 外质保护细胞免受外部威胁。


一般过去时:
The ectosarc contracted rapidly. = 外质迅速收缩。
The scientist observed the ectosarc under a microscope. = 科学家在显微镜下观察外质。


现在完成时:
The amoeba has extended its ectosarc several times. = 变形虫已经多次伸出其外质。
The research team has studied the ectosarc's function extensively. = 研究小组已经广泛研究了外质的功能。


过去完成时:
The ectosarc had already contracted before the stimulus was applied. = 在施加刺激之前，外质已经收缩了。
The scientists had never before seen such a dynamic ectosarc. = 科学家们以前从未见过如此活跃的外质。


将来时:
The ectosarc will likely contract in response to the chemical. = 外质可能会对化学物质作出收缩反应。
Researchers will continue to study the ectosarc's role in cell function. = 研究人员将继续研究外质在细胞功能中的作用。


虚拟语气:
If the ectosarc were damaged, the cell would be vulnerable. = 如果外质受损，细胞就会变得脆弱。
It is essential that the ectosarc remains intact for cell survival. = 为了细胞存活，外质必须保持完整。


被动语态:
