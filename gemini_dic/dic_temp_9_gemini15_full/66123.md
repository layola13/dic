词源:
From Late Middle English *eccentric, from Latin eccentricus, from Greek ekkentron, literally 'out of the center,' from ek- 'out of' + kentron 'center.'  The original astronomical meaning referred to a circle or orbit not having the same center as another.  The modern meaning developed in the 17th century.
