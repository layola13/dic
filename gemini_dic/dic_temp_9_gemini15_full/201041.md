词源:

The word "slopy" comes from the Middle English word "slopen," meaning "to slope."  This in turn has roots in the Old English word "slōpian,"  with connections to Proto-Germanic and possibly even Proto-Indo-European roots related to sliding or slipping.  The modern sense of "careless" or "unorganized" developed later as a metaphorical extension of the physical meaning of "sloping" or "leaning."
