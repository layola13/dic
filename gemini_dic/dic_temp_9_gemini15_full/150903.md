parallaxes: /ˈpærælæksɪz/ | n. |视差(复数) |The apparent shift in the position of an object when viewed from different positions.  Parallaxes are used in astronomy to measure the distances to stars and other celestial objects. |例句：Astronomers use parallaxes to determine the distances to nearby stars. 天文学家利用视差来确定附近恒星的距离。

例句：The measurement of stellar parallaxes is a fundamental technique in astrophysics. 测量恒星视差是天体物理学中的一项基本技术。


近义词：apparent displacement, angular displacement | 反义词：无


词源:  From Greek *parallaxis, from παράλλαξις (parallaxis), from παράλλος (parallos) "beside one another," from παρά (para) "beside" + ἄλλος (allos) "other."  The word reflects the apparent shift in an object's position as viewed from two different points.

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The parallax of that star is significant. = 那颗星的视差很大。
These measurements provide accurate parallaxes. = 这些测量结果提供了精确的视差。


一般过去时:
Scientists calculated the parallax of the quasar. = 科学家计算了类星体的视差。
The parallax was measured using a sophisticated instrument. = 视差是用精密仪器测量的。


现在完成时:
Astronomers have determined many stellar parallaxes. = 天文学家已经确定了许多恒星的视差。
We have successfully measured the parallax of this galaxy. = 我们已经成功地测量了这个星系的视差。


过去完成时:
Before the invention of the telescope, parallaxes of stars were unknown. = 在望远镜发明之前，人们不知道恒星的视差。
They had already calculated the parallax before publishing their findings. = 他们在发表研究结果之前就已经计算出视差了。


将来时:
We will measure the parallaxes of many more stars. = 我们将测量更多恒星的视差。
Future missions will provide more precise parallaxes. = 未来的任务将提供更精确的视差。


虚拟语气:
If we had better instruments, we could measure smaller parallaxes. = 如果我们有更好的仪器，我们就能测量更小的视差。
It would be amazing if we could measure the parallaxes of distant galaxies. = 如果我们能够测量遥远星系的视差，那将是惊人的。


被动语态:
The parallaxes were carefully analyzed. = 视差被仔细地分析了。
The distances are calculated from the measured parallaxes. = 距离是由测得的视差计算出来的。


疑问句:
What are the parallaxes of these objects? = 这些物体的视差是多少？
How are parallaxes used in astronomy? = 天文学中如何使用视差？


否定句:
The parallaxes were not significant enough. = 视差不够显著。
They did not accurately measure the parallaxes. = 他们没有准确地测量视差。
