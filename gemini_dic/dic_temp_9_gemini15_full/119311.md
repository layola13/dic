microbarom:/ˈmaɪkroʊˌbærəm/| n. |微气压|A microbarom is a very small unit of atmospheric pressure, often used in infrasound studies.  It refers to variations in atmospheric pressure caused by natural phenomena like waves or seismic activity. These variations are typically too small to be felt by humans.|例句：Scientists use sensitive instruments to detect microbaroms generated by ocean waves.  科学家使用灵敏的仪器来探测由海浪产生的微气压。

The study of microbaroms helps researchers understand atmospheric dynamics and long-range propagation of sound. 微气压的研究帮助研究人员了解大气动力学和声音的远距离传播。|近义词：infrasound pressure variation|反义词：macrobarom (not a standard term)
