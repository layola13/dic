词源:
The word "chillsome" is a relatively modern formation, combining "chill" (meaning a feeling of cold or unease) with the suffix "-some" (meaning "tending to," "causing," or "full of").  While not found in older dictionaries, its meaning is easily understood based on the component parts.  The "-some" suffix is productive in English, seen in words like "troublesome," "fearsome," and "lonesome."
