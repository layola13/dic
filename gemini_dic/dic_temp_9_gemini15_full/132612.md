nondirigibility: /ˌnɒnˌdɪrɪdʒɪˈbɪləti/ | n. | 不可操纵性，不可驾驶性 | The inability to be steered or controlled, especially of an aircraft.  This term is primarily used in the context of airships or other lighter-than-air craft. | Example: The sudden storm caused nondirigibility of the airship, leading to a crash.  暴风雨突然来临导致飞艇不可操控，最终坠毁。  | 近义词: uncontrollability, unsteerability | 反义词: steerability, controllability | 名词

否定句:
The new design does not suffer from the nondirigibility of the older model. = 新的设计没有旧型号的不可操纵性问题。
The pilot reported that the nondirigibility of the plane was not significant. = 飞行员报告说飞机的不可操纵性并不显著。


PHRASE->
lack of nondirigibility =  具有可操纵性 (This phrase is awkward;  it's better to use "good dirigibility" or "steerability")
address nondirigibility = 解决不可操纵性问题
improve nondirigibility = 改善可操纵性 (Again, awkward; use "improve dirigibility")
reduce nondirigibility = 减少不可操纵性
overcome nondirigibility = 克服不可操纵性
