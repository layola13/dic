seawalls: /ˈsiːwɔːlz/ | n. | 海墙；防波堤 |  A seawall is a structure built along a coastline to protect land from the destructive effects of ocean waves and erosion.  They are typically made of concrete, stone, or other durable materials. Seawalls are designed to absorb the energy of waves, reducing their impact on the shoreline. However, they can have negative environmental consequences, such as altering natural coastal processes and harming marine ecosystems. | 例句：The city built a high seawall to protect its harbor from storm surges.  这座城市建造了一道高高的海墙来保护其港口免受风暴潮的侵袭。

The erosion of the coastline necessitated the construction of seawalls.  海岸线的侵蚀使得建造海墙成为必要。


近义词：breakwater, revetment, bulkhead | 反义词：None (海墙本身没有直接的反义词，与其相反的概念是“没有海墙的保护”) |  词性: 名词
