The word "prebetrayed" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, or perhaps a misspelling.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  To offer help, we need to clarify the intended meaning or provide context where you encountered this word.  Is it a deliberate creation for a specific purpose (e.g., a fictional work)?  Is it a typo?  If you can provide more information, I can try to offer an analysis based on potential interpretations.
