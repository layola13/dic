It is a type of crystal structure where only half of the faces of a complete form are developed.  This can result from various factors, including the internal arrangement of atoms within the crystal lattice. |Example:  The mineral pyrite often displays hemihedral forms.  This means some of its crystal faces are absent compared to a fully developed cube.|近义词：partial crystal form|反义词：holohedron
