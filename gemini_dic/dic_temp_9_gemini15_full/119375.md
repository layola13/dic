microcoulomb:/ˈmaɪkroʊˌkuːlɒm/| n. |微库仑|A microcoulomb (µC) is a unit of electric charge, equal to one millionth of a coulomb (C).  It's a smaller unit used to measure smaller amounts of charge.|The capacitor stores a charge of 10 microcoulombs.|近义词:  (no direct synonym, but related units include coulomb, nanocoulomb)|反义词: (no direct antonym)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The capacitor stores a charge of 10 microcoulombs. = 电容器储存10微库仑的电荷。
A microcoulomb is one millionth of a coulomb. = 一微库仑是一库仑的百万分之一。


一般过去时:
The experiment measured 5 microcoulombs of charge. = 实验测量了5微库仑的电荷。
The device discharged 20 microcoulombs. = 该装置放电20微库仑。


现在完成时:
Scientists have measured extremely small charges in microcoulombs. = 科学家已经用微库仑测量了极小的电荷。
We have accumulated a total charge of 100 microcoulombs. = 我们已经积累了总共100微库仑的电荷。


过去完成时:
Before the discharge, the capacitor had stored 50 microcoulombs. = 放电前，电容器储存了50微库仑。
They had already measured several microcoulombs of static electricity. = 他们已经测量了几微库仑的静电。


将来时:
The experiment will measure several microcoulombs of charge. = 实验将测量几微库仑的电荷。
We will need a more sensitive instrument to measure such small amounts of charge in microcoulombs. = 我们需要更灵敏的仪器来测量这种微库仑的小量电荷。


虚拟语气:
If the charge were 100 microcoulombs, the capacitor would explode. = 如果电荷是100微库仑，电容器就会爆炸。
I wish I knew how many microcoulombs were stored in the device. = 我真希望知道设备中储存了多少微库仑。


被动语态:
A charge of 5 microcoulombs was measured. = 测量了5微库仑的电荷。
The microcoulombs were precisely measured using a sensitive electrometer. = 使用灵敏的静电计精确测量了微库仑。


疑问句:
How many microcoulombs are stored in the battery? = 电池中储存了多少微库仑？
What is the charge in microcoulombs? = 电荷是多少微库仑？


否定句:
The device did not store more than 10 microcoulombs. = 该设备储存的电荷不超过10微库仑。
The measurement did not show any significant charge in microcoulombs. = 测量结果没有显示任何显著的微库仑电荷。
