nonosmotic: /ˌnɒnɒzˈmɒtɪk/ | adj. |非渗透性的| Not involving or relating to osmosis; not causing or affected by osmosis.  The term describes substances or processes that do not involve the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane due to differences in solute concentration.  | 例句：The nonosmotic pressure in the solution was negligible.  该溶液中的非渗透压可以忽略不计。

The nonosmotic effects of the drug were studied separately from its osmotic effects.  该药物的非渗透性作用与其渗透性作用分开研究。


近义词：impermeable (in terms of water movement), non-osmotic


反义词：osmotic


词性:形容词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The solution exhibits nonosmotic properties. = 该溶液表现出非渗透性。
This process is nonosmotic in nature. = 这个过程本质上是非渗透性的。


一般过去时:
The experiment demonstrated nonosmotic behavior. = 实验显示了非渗透性行为。
Researchers found the substance to be nonosmotic. = 研究人员发现该物质是非渗透性的。


现在完成时:
Studies have confirmed the nonosmotic nature of the substance. = 研究证实了该物质的非渗透性。
Scientists have observed nonosmotic effects in several experiments. = 科学家在几个实验中观察到了非渗透性效应。


过去完成时:
They had already determined that the process was nonosmotic. = 他们已经确定该过程是非渗透性的。
It had been previously established that the solution was nonosmotic. = 此前已经确定该溶液是非渗透性的。


将来时:
Future research will explore nonosmotic mechanisms. = 未来的研究将探索非渗透机制。
We will analyze the nonosmotic components of the solution. = 我们将分析溶液的非渗透成分。


虚拟语气:
If the solution were nonosmotic, the results would be different. = 如果溶液是非渗透性的，结果就会不同。
It is important that the procedure be kept nonosmotic. = 保持程序的非渗透性很重要。


被动语态:
Nonosmotic effects are being investigated. = 正在研究非渗透性效应。

疑问句:
Is the process truly nonosmotic? = 这个过程真的是非渗透性的吗？
Are there any nonosmotic factors influencing the results? = 有任何非渗透性因素影响结果吗？


否定句:
The solution is not nonosmotic; it exhibits significant osmotic pressure. = 该溶液并非非渗透性的；它表现出明显的渗透压。
The effects observed were not entirely nonosmotic. = 观察到的效应并非完全是非渗透性的。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "nonosmotic" as a core component.  The term is primarily used in scientific contexts.  Related phrases might include:
