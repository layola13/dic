deviation:/ˌdiːviˈeɪʃən/| n. |偏差；背离；离差|The difference between a value and a mean or expected value.  It can refer to a departure from what is considered normal, standard, or expected.  |例句：The standard deviation shows how spread out the data is. 标准差显示数据的离散程度。

例句：There was a significant deviation from the planned budget.  与计划预算相比存在显著偏差。


近义词：departure, divergence, aberration, variation |反义词：conformity, adherence, agreement|词性：名词


Etymology:  The word "deviation" comes from the Middle French word *deviation*,  which itself derives from the Latin verb *deviare*, meaning "to turn aside" or "to stray".  The prefix "de-" indicates "away from," and the root "-viare" relates to "way" or "path".


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The data shows a significant deviation from the norm. = 数据显示与常态存在显著偏差。

疑问句:
Are there any significant deviations in the data? = 数据中是否存在任何显著偏差？
What caused the deviation from the expected outcome? = 什么导致了与预期结果的偏差？


否定句:
There were no significant deviations in the test results. = 测试结果没有显著偏差。
The experiment showed no deviation from the hypothesis. = 实验结果与假设没有偏差。


PHRASE->
