USAGE->
This word is an adverb,  it doesn't have verb conjugations like "what".  It describes where something is found in a text, not actions.  Therefore, grammatical tenses, voice, or mood are irrelevant to the word "passim".  There's no such thing as "passim in the past tense" or "passim in the passive voice."

PHRASE->
Passim is not typically used in phrases.  It functions as a single word indicating scattered occurrences.
