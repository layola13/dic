electroneutrality: /ɪˌlɛktrəʊnuːˈtræliti/ | n. | 电中性；电平衡 |  The condition of having equal amounts of positive and negative electric charges, resulting in a net charge of zero.  This state is crucial in many biological and chemical systems. For example, maintaining electroneutrality across cell membranes is vital for proper cell function. |  Maintaining electroneutrality is essential for the stability of biological systems.  保持电中性对于生物系统的稳定性至关重要。


The cell membrane maintains electroneutrality by regulating the movement of ions.  细胞膜通过调节离子的运动来维持电中性。


近义词：electrical neutrality, charge balance | 反义词：charge imbalance, electrical disequilibrium

词源：
* **electro-**: from Greek  ἤλεκτρον (ēlektron), meaning "amber,"  a substance that exhibits static electricity.
* **neutral**: from Latin *neutrālis*, meaning "neither," "belonging to neither side."
* **-ity**: a suffix forming nouns of state or quality.
