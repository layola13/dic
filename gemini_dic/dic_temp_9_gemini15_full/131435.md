nonclotting: /ˌnɒnˈklɒtɪŋ/ | adj. |非凝固的，不凝结的 | Not causing or tending to cause clotting or coagulation.  |The nonclotting properties of the new drug are being studied. 新药的非凝血特性正在被研究。|近义词：anticoagulant, noncoagulant |反义词：clotting, coagulant


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The medication prevents nonclotting of the blood. = 这种药物可以防止血液不凝固。(This example is awkward because "nonclotting" describes a state, not an action.  A better phrasing would be "prevents blood clotting".)
This solution ensures nonclotting of the sample. =  该溶液确保样品不凝结。


一般过去时:
The experiment demonstrated the nonclotting nature of the substance. = 实验证明了该物质的非凝结性。
The results showed nonclotting in the treated group. = 结果显示治疗组没有凝血。


现在完成时:
Research has shown the significant nonclotting effects of this compound. = 研究表明该化合物的显著的非凝血作用。
The study has confirmed the nonclotting properties of the material. = 研究证实了该材料的非凝血特性。


过去完成时:
Scientists had already observed the nonclotting behavior before the publication. = 科学家在发表论文之前就已经观察到这种非凝固行为。
The researchers had determined the nonclotting mechanism prior to the clinical trials. = 研究人员在临床试验之前已经确定了非凝血机制。


将来时:
Future studies will investigate the long-term nonclotting effects. = 未来研究将调查其长期的非凝血作用。
We will analyze the nonclotting potential of this new agent. = 我们将分析这种新药剂的非凝血潜力。


虚拟语气:
If the solution were nonclotting, the experiment would be successful. = 如果溶液不凝结，实验就会成功。
It would be beneficial if we could enhance the nonclotting capabilities of the drug. = 如果我们能够增强该药物的非凝血能力，那将是有益的。


被动语态:
The nonclotting properties of the substance were confirmed by the tests. = 该物质的非凝血特性已通过测试得到证实。
The mechanism of nonclotting is being actively investigated. = 非凝血机制正在积极研究中。


疑问句:
Is the new drug truly nonclotting? = 新药真的不会凝血吗？
Are there any other known substances with similar nonclotting characteristics? = 是否还有其他已知的具有类似非凝血特性的物质？


否定句:
The sample was not nonclotting; it coagulated rapidly. = 样本不是非凝结的；它迅速凝固了。
The results did not support the hypothesis of nonclotting. = 结果不支持非凝血的假设。


PHRASE->
nonclotting blood = 不凝血
nonclotting agent = 非凝血剂
nonclotting properties = 非凝血特性
nonclotting effect = 非凝血效应
nonclotting time = 非凝血时间
