词源:
The word "deflate" comes from the Latin prefix "de-" (meaning "down" or "away") and the Latin word "flatus" (meaning "a blowing").  It originally referred to the act of letting air out of something.  The modern usage has broadened to include the figurative sense of reducing something's size, importance, or value.
