The word "overtinseling" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a newly coined word, or a word from a very specialized or fictional context.  To provide the analysis you request, I would need a correctly spelled word or more information about its context.
