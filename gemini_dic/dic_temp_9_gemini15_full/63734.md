epibolic:/ˌɛpɪˈbɒlɪk/| adj.|外胚层的；外胚层发生的；外向生长的| Relating to or characterized by epibole, a type of embryonic development in which the outer layer of cells spreads over the inner layers.|The epibolic movement of the ectoderm during gastrulation is crucial for the formation of the neural tube.|近义词：overgrowing, enveloping|反义词：involutional


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The ectoderm shows epibolic movement. = 外胚层表现出外胚层运动。
This process is an epibolic expansion. = 这个过程是外胚层扩张。

一般过去时:
Epibolic growth characterized the early stages. = 外胚层生长是早期的特点。
The cells underwent epibolic migration. = 细胞经历了外胚层迁移。


现在完成时:
The embryo has completed epibolic gastrulation. = 胚胎已经完成了外胚层胃肠道形成。
Researchers have observed epibolic cell movements. = 研究人员已经观察到外胚层细胞运动。


过去完成时:
The neural tube had formed after epibolic closure. = 神经管在外胚层闭合后形成。
Before gastrulation, the cells had exhibited little epibolic activity. = 在原肠胚形成之前，细胞表现出很少的外胚层活动。


将来时:
The cells will undergo epibolic spreading. = 细胞将进行外胚层扩散。
Scientists will study the mechanisms of epibolic movement. = 科学家将研究外胚层运动的机制。


虚拟语气:
If the epibolic movement failed, development would be impaired. = 如果外胚层运动失败，发育就会受损。
I wish I had better understood epibolic gastrulation. = 我希望我更好地理解外胚层胃肠道形成。


被动语态:
Epibolic gastrulation is observed in many species. = 在许多物种中都观察到外胚层胃肠道形成。
The process of epibolic cell movement is being investigated. = 正在研究外胚层细胞运动的过程。


疑问句:
Is this a type of epibolic cell movement? = 这是外胚层细胞运动的一种类型吗？
What are the key factors driving epibolic expansion? = 推动外胚层扩张的关键因素是什么？


否定句:
This is not an example of epibolic growth. = 这不是外胚层生长的例子。
The cells did not exhibit significant epibolic migration. = 细胞没有表现出显著的外胚层迁移。


PHRASE->
epibolic movement = 外胚层运动
epibolic expansion = 外胚层扩张
epibolic gastrulation = 外胚层原肠胚形成
epibolic cell migration = 外胚层细胞迁移
epibolic closure = 外胚层闭合
