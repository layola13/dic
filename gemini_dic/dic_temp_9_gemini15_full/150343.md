Etymology:

The word "panicle" comes from the Late Latin word *panicula, a diminutive of *panus meaning "a tuft of hair," suggesting a resemblance to a fluffy or branched cluster.  The ultimate origin is likely Proto-Indo-European *peh₂-  which also gave rise to words related to spreading or branching.
