词源:
The word "looner" likely originated as a slang term, possibly derived from "loon," a bird known for its unusual calls and sometimes erratic behavior. The association of the bird's behavior with eccentric human behavior led to the adoption of "looner" as a term for a strange or eccentric person.  There isn't a definitive etymological record tracing its precise origin, but the connection to the bird's unusual nature is widely accepted.
