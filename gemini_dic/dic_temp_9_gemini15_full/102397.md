The word "jable" is not a recognized word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a very specialized jargon, or a word from a fictional language.
