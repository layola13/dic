词源:

The word "hypersensitized" is formed by combining the prefix "hyper-" (meaning "over" or "excessive") with the word "sensitized," which itself comes from "sensitize," meaning "to make sensitive."  "Sensitize" originates from the Latin word "sentire," meaning "to feel." Therefore,  "hypersensitized" literally means "excessively sensitive."
