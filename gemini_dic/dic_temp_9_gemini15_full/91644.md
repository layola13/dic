词源:

The word "hyperbolist" is derived from the Greek word "hyperbole" (ὑπερβολή), which itself comes from the verb "hyperballein" (ὑπερβάλλειν), meaning "to throw beyond" or "to exceed."  This reflects the nature of hyperbole as a rhetorical device that goes beyond the literal truth to achieve a particular effect.


用法说明:

The word "hyperbolist" is relatively uncommon in everyday conversation. It's more likely to be used in literary criticism, rhetorical analysis, or discussions about the use of language.  It describes individuals who frequently or skillfully employ hyperbole in their communication.  The term doesn't carry a negative connotation; it simply identifies a stylistic preference.


例句:

Many successful politicians are skilled hyperbolists, using exaggeration to rally support.  许多成功的政治家都是熟练的夸张者，利用夸张来争取支持。

Some authors are known for their use of hyperbole, and are therefore considered hyperbolists.  一些作家以其夸张手法而闻名，因此被认为是夸张者。


需要注意的是，由于"hyperbolist"本身是一个比较专业的词汇，因此在实际应用中，更常用的表达方式可能是直接描述其行为，例如"a person who often exaggerates" 或 "someone who uses hyperbole frequently"。
