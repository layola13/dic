词源:
The word "harbingering" comes from the Old French word "herbergier," meaning "to lodge" or "to shelter."  This evolved into the Middle English word "herberger," which then took on the figurative meaning of "to precede" or "to announce," ultimately leading to its modern usage.  The connection lies in the idea of a harbinger arriving before an event, like a messenger or a sign, much like a traveler finding lodging before their journey's end.
