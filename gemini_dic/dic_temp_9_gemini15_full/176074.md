词源:
The word "ravish" ultimately derives from the Old French word "raviss," meaning "to snatch away" or "to carry off."  This further traces back to the Latin word "rapere," meaning "to seize" or "to snatch."  The sense of overwhelming emotion evolved later, followed by the more negative connotation of rape.
