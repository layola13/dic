英文解析:  The word "semianthropologic" is a combination of "semi-" (meaning half or partly) and "anthropologic" (relating to anthropology, the study of humanity). Therefore, it describes something that is partially or incompletely related to anthropology, incorporating some but not all of its aspects.


例句:
