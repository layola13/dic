词源:
The word "conning" ultimately derives from the Old French word "coner," meaning "to know," "to understand," or "to be acquainted with."  Over time, its meaning shifted to imply a more cunning or deceptive use of knowledge, leading to its current association with trickery and deceit.  The shift in meaning reflects the evolution of language and how words can acquire new connotations over centuries.
