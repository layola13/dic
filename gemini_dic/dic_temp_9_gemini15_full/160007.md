polystome:/ˈpɒlistəʊm/| n. |多口吸虫|A polystome is a type of monogenean flatworm, characterized by a large number of suckers or adhesive organs on its posterior end (opisthaptor).  These suckers help the worm attach itself firmly to its host, typically the gills of fishes. |Example: The polystome was found firmly attached to the gill filaments of the fish.|近义词：monogenean (in a broader sense)|反义词：N/A
