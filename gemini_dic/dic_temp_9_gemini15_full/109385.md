lenticellate:/ˌlɛntɪˈsɛleɪt/| n. |皮孔；小孔；透气孔 |A lenticel is a small pore, usually on the stem of a woody plant, that allows gas exchange between the atmosphere and the internal tissues of the plant.  They appear as slightly raised, often oblong or elliptical, spots on the surface of the bark. |例句：The bark of the apple tree was rough and covered with numerous lenticels. 苹果树的树皮粗糙，布满了许多皮孔。|例句：The researcher examined the lenticels under a microscope to study their structure. 研究人员用显微镜检查皮孔以研究它们的结构。|近义词：pore, stoma |反义词： N/A
