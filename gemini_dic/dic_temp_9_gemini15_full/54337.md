PHRASE->
There are not many common phrases directly using "disherit". The verb is used mostly independently.  However, we can consider related phrases:

词源:
The word "disherit" comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away from" or "the opposite of") and the word "inherit."  "Inherit" comes from the Old French word "inheriter," ultimately deriving from the Latin "haereditare," meaning "to make an heir."  Therefore, "disherit" literally means "to take away the right to inherit."
