The word "moris" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?

2. **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name (person, place, or thing) or a brand name not widely known.  If this is the case, more context is needed.

3. **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into English.  Providing the language of origin would be helpful.

4. **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context. Again, more context is crucial.


To help me provide the analysis you want, please provide more information about where you encountered this word and any context surrounding it.
