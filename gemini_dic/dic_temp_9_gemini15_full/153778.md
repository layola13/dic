peptonoid:/ˈpɛptənɔɪd/| n. |拟肽 |Peptonoids are synthetic oligomers that mimic the structure and properties of peptides, but with modified backbones.  They are designed to overcome some limitations of peptides, such as poor stability and low bioavailability.  These modifications can include changes to the amino acid side chains or the peptide backbone itself, leading to enhanced properties like increased resistance to enzymatic degradation, improved cell permeability, and altered pharmacological activity.  | Example: Researchers are exploring the use of peptonoids in drug delivery systems due to their enhanced stability and cell penetration.  研究人员正在探索将拟肽用于药物递送系统，因为它们具有增强的稳定性和细胞渗透性。|近义词：peptide mimetic, peptidomimetic |反义词：无
