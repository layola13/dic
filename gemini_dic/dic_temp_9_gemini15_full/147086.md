词源:

The word is a combination of:

* **over-**:  A prefix indicating excess or to a greater degree than normal.
* **licentious**:  (adj.) lacking moral restraint; disregarding accepted rules or conventions.  This word comes from the Old French *licencieux*, from *licence* (license).
* **-ly**:  An adverbial suffix.
* **-ous**: An adjectival suffix.


Therefore, "overlicentiously" describes an action performed with excessive or inappropriate freedom, beyond the bounds of what's permitted or morally acceptable,  often related to the abuse of a license or permission.
