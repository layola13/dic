The word "matwali" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a word from another language, possibly Hindi or another South Asian language.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and English usage description are not possible without knowing its origin.  To provide the requested format, I need the language of origin and definition.  Please provide more context.
