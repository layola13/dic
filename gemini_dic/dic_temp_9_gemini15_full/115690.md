词源:

The word "marginalised" is derived from the noun "margin," meaning the edge or border of something.  The verb "marginalize" emerged in the 19th century, initially used in a literal sense related to putting something on the margins of a page or a text.  However, its figurative use, referring to the social and political exclusion of individuals or groups, gained prominence in the 20th century, particularly in discussions of social justice and inequality.  The "-ized" suffix indicates a process of being made or rendered marginal.
