词源:
The word "powerful" comes from the Old English word "full," meaning "full of" and "power".  The word "power" itself has a complex etymology tracing back to Latin "potentia" (power, ability) and ultimately to "posse" (to be able). Thus, "powerful" literally means "full of power" or "possessing great ability".
