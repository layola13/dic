词源:
The word "excursionist" is derived from the noun "excursion," which comes from the Old French word "excursion," ultimately from the Latin "excurrere," meaning "to run out."  The suffix "-ist" denotes a person who performs or is associated with the action of the root word.  Therefore, an "excursionist" is someone who engages in excursions.
