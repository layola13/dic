词源:  The word "miniature" comes from the Medieval Latin word "miniare," which meant "to paint with red lead." This referred to the practice of illuminating manuscripts with colorful decorations, often including small, detailed paintings.  Over time, the word evolved to describe anything small and finely detailed, leading to its modern meaning.
