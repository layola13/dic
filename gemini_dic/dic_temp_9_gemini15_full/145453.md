词源:  The word "overcivil" is a straightforward combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the adjective "civil," which means polite and courteous.  Its meaning thus directly derives from the combination of these two elements.  The word emerged in the English language through natural semantic extension, reflecting a growing need to describe a degree of politeness that surpasses mere courtesy and borders on insincerity or awkwardness.
