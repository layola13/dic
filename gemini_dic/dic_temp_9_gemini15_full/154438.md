词源:
The word "perambulator" comes from the verb "perambulate," meaning "to walk about," "to stroll," or "to travel over."  This verb itself derives from the Latin word "perambulare," which is a compound of "per-" (through, thoroughly) and "ambulare" (to walk).  Therefore, a perambulator literally means something that "walks about" or is used for walking about, referring to its function of being pushed around.
