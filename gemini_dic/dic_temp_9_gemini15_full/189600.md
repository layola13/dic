salification:/ˌsælɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/| n. | 盐化；成盐作用 | The process of forming a salt, typically through the reaction of an acid and a base.  This process can involve the neutralization of an acid by a base, resulting in the formation of a salt and water.  Salification is crucial in various chemical processes and is also observed in biological systems. | Example: The salification of hydrochloric acid with sodium hydroxide produces sodium chloride (salt) and water. 盐酸与氢氧化钠的成盐作用产生氯化钠（盐）和水。 |近义词：salt formation, neutralization |反义词：N/A
