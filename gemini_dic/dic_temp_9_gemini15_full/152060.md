The word "patenters" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis according to the requested format.  To help, I need clarification:

* **Is it a misspelling?**  If so, what is the intended word?  (e.g., "patentee," "patenting," "patient")
* **Is it a technical term?**  If so, from what field?  Providing context would be helpful.
* **Is it a newly coined word?** If so, what is its intended meaning?


Once you provide more information, I can offer a more accurate and helpful response.
