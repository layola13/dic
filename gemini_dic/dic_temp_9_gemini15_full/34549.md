The phrase "clear-from" does not exist as a single, established English word or idiom.  It's likely a combination of "clear" and "from," used together to describe an action or state.  Therefore, a detailed analysis in the requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need to analyze "clear" and "from" individually and then explore how they might be used together contextually.

**Possible contextual uses of "clear from":**

The phrase "clear from" might appear in sentences like these:

* "Clear the debris from the road." = 清除路上的碎石。 (Here, "clear" is a verb, and "from" indicates the source of what's being cleared.)
* "The path was clear from obstacles." = 小路没有障碍物。 (Here, "clear" is an adjective describing the path's state.)
* "Keep clear from the edge of the cliff." = 远离悬崖边缘。 (Here, "clear" functions as an adverb, meaning "at a safe distance".)


Because "clear-from" is not a standalone word, there are no established near synonyms, antonyms, or specific grammatical tense examples outside the context of how "clear" and "from" are used together.  The usage depends entirely on the sentence structure and intended meaning.
