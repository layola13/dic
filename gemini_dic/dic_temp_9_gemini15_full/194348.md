self-politician: /ˌsɛlf ˈpɒlətɪʃən/ | n. | 自我政治家，投机政客 | A self-politician is someone who prioritizes self-promotion and personal gain over the interests of the public or their political party. They often engage in manipulative tactics and prioritize their own image and advancement.  They are characterized by a lack of genuine commitment to political ideals and a focus on personal ambition. | 例句：He was seen as a self-politician, more interested in securing his own position than in serving the community. 他被认为是一个自我政治家，更关心的是巩固自己的地位而不是为社区服务。


The term is not commonly found in dictionaries, as it's a descriptive term rather than a standard political label.  It's formed by combining "self-" (emphasizing the individual's self-interest) with "politician."


词源:

* **self-**:  Prefix indicating something done by or for oneself, often with an implication of self-interest or selfishness.  It's derived from Old English *self*.

* **politician**: From French *politicien*, ultimately from Latin *politicus* ("of or relating to the polis" or city-state), from *polis* ("city").
