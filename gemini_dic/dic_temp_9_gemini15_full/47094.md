词源:
The word "daubingly" is derived from the verb "daub," which comes from the Old French word "dauber," meaning "to plaster" or "to smear."  The suffix "-ingly" is an adverbial suffix indicating manner. Therefore, "daubingly" describes an action performed in a manner similar to daubing—messily, roughly, or carelessly.
