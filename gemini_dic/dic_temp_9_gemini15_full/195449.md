seminormality:/ˌsɛmɪˈnɔːrmæliti/ | n. | 半正态性；半当量浓度 |  A concentration of a solution that contains one-half the number of gram-equivalents of solute per liter as a normal solution.  It is often used in chemistry, particularly in titrations. | Example: The seminormal solution of sulfuric acid was carefully prepared for the experiment.  半当量的硫酸溶液被仔细地配制用于实验。 | 近义词：half-normal concentration | 反义词：normality


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The seminormality of this solution is 0.5N. = 这个溶液的半当量浓度是0.5N。
What is the seminormality of the hydrochloric acid? = 盐酸的半当量浓度是多少？


一般过去时:
The seminormality of the solution was carefully measured. = 溶液的半当量浓度被仔细测量了。
We calculated the seminormality after the titration. = 我们在滴定后计算了半当量浓度。


现在完成时:
They have determined the seminormality of the sample. = 他们已经测定了样品的半当量浓度。
Scientists have used seminormal solutions in many experiments. = 科学家们在许多实验中使用了半当量溶液。


过去完成时:
The chemist had already calculated the seminormality before the presentation. = 化学家在演示之前已经计算出了半当量浓度。
We had prepared the seminormal solution before starting the experiment. = 我们在开始实验之前已经配制好了半当量溶液。


将来时:
We will determine the seminormality tomorrow. = 我们明天将测定半当量浓度。
The students will use seminormal solutions in their next lab. = 学生们将在他们的下一个实验室中使用半当量溶液。


虚拟语气:
If the seminormality were higher, the reaction would be faster. = 如果半当量浓度更高，反应会更快。
I wish the seminormality was more precise. = 我希望半当量浓度更精确。


被动语态:
The seminormality was calculated using a standard formula. = 半当量浓度是用标准公式计算的。
The seminormal solution is prepared by diluting a normal solution. = 半当量溶液是通过稀释标准溶液制备的。


疑问句:
What is the seminormality of the solution? = 溶液的半当量浓度是多少？
How do you calculate the seminormality? = 你如何计算半当量浓度？


否定句:
The seminormality of the solution was not accurately determined. = 溶液的半当量浓度没有被精确测定。
We did not use a seminormal solution in this experiment. = 我们在这个实验中没有使用半当量溶液。


PHRASE->
