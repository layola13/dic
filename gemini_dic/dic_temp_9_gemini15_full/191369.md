词源:
The word "schedule" comes from the Medieval Latin word "schedula," a diminutive of "scheda," meaning "a small leaf of paper,"  ultimately deriving from the Greek word "skhēma," meaning "form" or "shape."  The original sense was a small piece of paper containing a list or note.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass planned events and their timings.
