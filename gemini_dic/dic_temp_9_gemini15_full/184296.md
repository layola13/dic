词源:

The word "resourcelessness" is derived from the noun "resource" and the suffix "-lessness."

* **Resource:** This word ultimately originates from the Old French word "ressource," meaning "a spring of water; resort; expedient; help." It's composed of the prefix "re-" (again) and the verb "sourdre" (to rise, spring up).  Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass any means or materials available to meet a need or achieve a goal.

* **-lessness:** This suffix is a common English suffix indicating the absence or lack of something.  It is added to nouns to form abstract nouns denoting a state of being without that quality.

Therefore, "resourcelessness" literally means "the state of being without resources."
