现在完成时:
Scientists have studied meroblastic cleavage extensively. = 科学家们已经广泛研究了不完全卵裂。
We have observed several instances of meroblastic development. = 我们已经观察到几个不完全卵裂发育的例子。


过去完成时:
They had already identified the egg as meroblastic before the experiment. = 他们在实验之前已经确定该卵是不完全卵裂的。

疑问句:
Is this type of egg development meroblastic? = 这种类型的卵发育是不完全卵裂的吗？
What are the characteristics of meroblastic cleavage? = 不完全卵裂的特征是什么？


否定句:
The egg is not meroblastic; it is holoblastic. = 这个卵不是不完全卵裂的；它是完全卵裂的。
The results do not support the hypothesis of meroblastic development. = 结果不支持不完全卵裂发育的假设。


PHRASE->
meroblastic cleavage = 不完全卵裂
meroblastic egg = 不完全卵裂卵
meroblastic development = 不完全卵裂发育
meroblastic segmentation = 不完全卵裂分割
types of meroblastic cleavage = 不完全卵裂的类型


词源:
From Greek *meros ("part") + -blastic.  The "-blastic" suffix indicates a formative or developmental process.  Therefore, "meroblastic" literally means "part-forming," referring to the partial nature of the cell division.
