词源:
The word "overfactitious" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much") and the adjective "factitious" (meaning "artificial," "contrived," or "made up").  "Factitious" itself comes from the Latin word "factitius," which is the past participle of "facere," meaning "to make" or "to do."
