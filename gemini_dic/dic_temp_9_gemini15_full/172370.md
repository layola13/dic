词源:

The word "putty" originates from the Old French word "pute," meaning "putrid" or "rotten."  This refers to the original use of putty, a mixture of whiting and linseed oil, which was used to fill holes and cracks in wood, essentially sealing them off from decay.  The spelling and pronunciation evolved over time to the modern "putty."
