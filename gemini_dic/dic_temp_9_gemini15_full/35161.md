词源:
The word "clown" ultimately derives from the Old French word "clovin," which meant "rustic," "boor," or "peasant."  This evolved through Middle English, where it retained some of its negative connotations associated with simple-mindedness or foolishness.  Over time, the meaning shifted to its modern association with circus performers and comedic characters.  The modern meaning developed gradually, with the word's initial negative connotations eventually being replaced by a more positive association with entertainment and humor.
