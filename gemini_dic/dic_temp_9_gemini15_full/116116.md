词源:
The word "marvellous" ultimately derives from the Old French word "merveilleus," meaning "wonderful" or "amazing."  This in turn comes from the Old French noun "merveille," meaning "wonder," which itself derives from the Latin word "mirabilis," meaning "wonderful" or "admirable."  The suffix "-ous" is a common English adjective-forming suffix.
