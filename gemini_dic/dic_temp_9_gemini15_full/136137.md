The word "nonreformation" is not a commonly used word and lacks a rich history in standard dictionaries.  It's a relatively modern coinage formed through combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "reformation" (meaning a process of improving or amending something, often referring to the historical Protestant Reformation).
