/ˌnɒnkɒntrɪˈbjuːtɪvnəsɪz/| n. |不贡献；无贡献性；缺乏贡献的行为|The report highlighted the noncontributivenesses of certain team members, leading to project delays.  这份报告突出了某些团队成员的无贡献性，导致项目延误。|近义词：unproductiveness, idleness, ineffectiveness|反义词：productivity, contribution, effectiveness|名词


This word is extremely rare and not found in standard dictionaries. It's formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" (pluralizing suffix indicating qualities or states) to "noncontributiveness," which itself is formed from:

* **non-**: a prefix meaning "not"
* **contributive**: an adjective meaning "making a contribution; helpful"
* **-ness**: a suffix forming abstract nouns of state or quality.

Therefore, "noncontributivenesses" refers to multiple instances or aspects of lacking contribution or being unhelpful.  Because of its rarity and unwieldiness, it's best to use simpler, more common alternatives like "instances of non-contribution,"  "lack of contributions," or "ineffectivenesses."
