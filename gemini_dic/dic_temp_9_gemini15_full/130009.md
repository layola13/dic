non-object:/ˈnɑːnˌɑːbdʒɛkt/ | adj. | 非对象的，非客体的 |  Describes something that is not an object; it lacks the properties or characteristics typically associated with objects in a particular context (e.g., programming, philosophy).  It can refer to abstract concepts, processes, or entities that are not tangible or physical. | Example: In object-oriented programming, a non-object is anything that doesn't belong to a class or doesn't have methods and properties.  在面向对象编程中，非对象是指任何不属于类或不具有方法和属性的东西。 | 近义词: abstract, intangible, non-physical  | 反义词: object, concrete, tangible | adj.


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in specific technical contexts, not in general conversation.  Therefore, providing grammatical examples in various tenses is not applicable in the same way as for common words like "what". The usage depends heavily on the field.

For example, in philosophy:

The concept of time is often considered a non-object in certain philosophical discussions. 时间的概念在某些哲学讨论中通常被认为是一个非对象。

In computer science (Object-Oriented Programming):

Functions in some programming languages might be considered non-objects if they lack the properties of objects in that particular language's paradigm. 在某些编程语言中，如果函数缺乏该语言范式中对象的属性，则可能被认为是非对象。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "non-object" as it's a technical term.  The usage is highly context-dependent and phrases would be specific to the area of study (e.g., "non-object-oriented programming").  没有使用“非对象”的常用习语短语，因为它是一个技术术语。其用法高度依赖于上下文，短语将特定于研究领域（例如，“非面向对象编程”）。
