词源:

The word "couth" ultimately derives from the Old English word "cūþ," meaning "known," "familiar," or "skilled."  Over time, this evolved into a sense of being socially adept and well-versed in the customs of polite society.  The modern sense of "couth" as a positive quality, however, is a relatively recent development, and even now, it's not a frequently used word. The word's opposite, "uncouth," is far more common.


用法说明:

"Couth" is an adjective used to describe someone or something possessing refined manners, elegance, and social grace.  It implies a high degree of politeness and sophistication.  Note that it's a rather formal and uncommon word, so its use should be reserved for situations where a more nuanced and precise description of refined behavior is needed.  It's not a synonym for simply being "polite," but rather suggests a more subtle and ingrained social refinement.


由于"couth"本身使用频率低，因此无法提供各语法时态的例句。其用法主要体现在对人物性格或行为的形容。
