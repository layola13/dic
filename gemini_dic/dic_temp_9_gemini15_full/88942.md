词源：

The word "holdover" comes from the verb "hold over," meaning to continue in a position or situation beyond the usual or expected time.  The prefix "hold" signifies retention or continuation, and the suffix "-over" indicates an extension or carryover.  The noun form "holdovers" thus refers to things or people that are "held over" from a previous period.
