half-wicket:/ˈhɑːfˌwɪkɪt/| n.|半门|In cricket, a half-wicket is when the bails are dislodged but the stumps remain standing.

It is not considered an out. |The bowler bowled a fierce delivery, hitting the stumps and dislodging the bails – a near half-wicket.|近义词：near miss (in this context)|反义词：wicket|
