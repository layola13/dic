词源:

The word "engine" comes from the Old French word "engin," meaning "contrivance, device, machine," ultimately derived from the Latin word "ingenium," meaning "cleverness, talent, invention."  The meaning shifted over time to specifically refer to mechanical devices and eventually focused on machines that produce motion.
