paratectonic: /ˌpærəˈtɛktɑːnɪk/ | adj. | 副构造的；与构造无关的 | Relating to or denoting structures or processes that are not directly related to the main tectonic features of a region.  Paratectonic structures are typically formed by less intense processes than those associated with plate tectonics, such as sediment compaction, slumping, or shallow faulting. | The paratectonic deformation in this region is characterized by gentle folding and minor faulting.  这个区域的副构造变形特征是轻微的褶皱和轻微的断层。 | 近义词：epitectonic, extra-tectonic | 反义词：tectonic


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The paratectonic structures are formed by sediment compaction. = 副构造构造是由沉积物压实形成的。
This region displays significant paratectonic activity. = 这个地区显示出明显的副构造活动。


一般过去时:
Paratectonic deformation occurred during the late Mesozoic. = 副构造变形发生在中生代晚期。
The geologists studied the paratectonic features of the outcrop. = 地质学家研究了露头的副构造特征。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several areas with prominent paratectonic features. = 科学家们已经确定了几个具有显著副构造特征的区域。
Researchers have documented the impact of paratectonic processes on sediment distribution. = 研究人员记录了副构造过程对沉积物分布的影响。


过去完成时:
Before the main tectonic event, significant paratectonic activity had already occurred. = 在主要构造事件发生之前，已经发生了重大的副构造活动。
Geologists had observed these paratectonic structures in previous studies. = 地质学家在之前的研究中已经观察到这些副构造结构。


将来时:
Future research will focus on the relationship between tectonic and paratectonic processes. = 未来的研究将集中在构造过程和副构造过程之间的关系。
We will investigate the paratectonic structures in more detail next year. = 我们明年将更详细地研究副构造结构。


虚拟语气:
If the deformation were solely paratectonic, the structures would be less complex. = 如果变形仅仅是副构造的，那么结构将不那么复杂。
It is unlikely that the observed structures are purely paratectonic. = 观察到的结构不太可能是纯粹的副构造的。


被动语态:
Paratectonic structures are often overlooked in tectonic analyses. = 副构造结构在构造分析中经常被忽视。
The origin of these structures is believed to be paratectonic. = 这些结构的起源被认为是副构造的。


疑问句:
Are these structures tectonic or paratectonic in origin? = 这些结构是构造起源还是副构造起源？
What are the characteristics of paratectonic deformation in this area? = 这个地区副构造变形的特征是什么？


否定句:
The deformation is not solely paratectonic; tectonic forces also played a role. = 变形不仅仅是副构造的；构造力也发挥了作用。
These structures are not considered to be primarily paratectonic. = 这些结构不被认为主要是副构造的。
