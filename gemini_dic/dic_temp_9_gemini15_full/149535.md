词源:
The word "page-boy" combines "page" (meaning a boy attendant or messenger) and "boy".  The origin of "page" in this context traces back to Old French *page, ultimately from Latin *pagius, meaning "boy servant, attendant".  The hairstyle's name likely derives from its resemblance to the hair often worn by page boys in the past.
