WORD ORIGIN->

The word "semipurposiveness" is a modern coinage, formed by combining the following elements:

* **semi-**:  A prefix meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."  It derives from Latin *semi*.

* **purposive**: An adjective meaning "having or showing a definite purpose or intention." It's derived from "purpose" + "-ive" (adjectival suffix).  "Purpose" itself originates from Old French *purpos*, ultimately from Latin *propositum* ("something proposed").

* **-ness**: A suffix used to form abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.


Therefore, "semipurposiveness" literally means "the state or quality of being partly purposeful."
