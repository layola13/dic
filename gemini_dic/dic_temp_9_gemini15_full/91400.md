hydroxides:/haɪˈdrɒksʌɪdz/ | n. |氢氧化物 |Hydroxides are chemical compounds containing one or more hydroxide ions (OH−) bonded to a metal cation.  They are typically formed by the reaction of a metal oxide with water.  Many hydroxides are bases, meaning they react with acids to form salts and water.  Some hydroxides are insoluble in water, while others are soluble and form alkaline solutions. | Example: Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) is a strong base used in many industrial processes. 氢氧化钠（NaOH）是一种强碱，广泛应用于许多工业过程中。|近义词:alkalis, bases|反义词:acids


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Hydroxides react with acids to form salts and water. = 氢氧化物与酸反应生成盐和水。
Sodium hydroxide dissolves readily in water. = 氢氧化钠易溶于水。


一般过去时:
The experiment produced a precipitate of metal hydroxide. = 实验产生了金属氢氧化物的沉淀。
We added hydrochloric acid to the hydroxide solution. = 我们向氢氧化物溶液中加入了盐酸。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the properties of many different hydroxides. = 科学家们已经研究了许多不同氢氧化物的性质。
The reaction has yielded a significant amount of hydroxide. = 该反应产生了大量的氢氧化物。


过去完成时:
The hydroxide had already reacted before the acid was added. = 在加入酸之前，氢氧化物已经反应了。
The solution had become highly alkaline due to the hydroxide formation. = 由于氢氧化物的形成，溶液已经变得高度碱性。


将来时:
We will test the pH of the hydroxide solution tomorrow. = 我们明天将测试氢氧化物溶液的pH值。
The researchers will synthesize a new type of hydroxide. = 研究人员将合成一种新型氢氧化物。


虚拟语气:
If the hydroxide were more soluble, the reaction would proceed faster. = 如果氢氧化物更易溶解，反应将进行得更快。
I wish I had known the hydroxide concentration before the experiment. = 我希望在实验之前就知道氢氧化物的浓度。


被动语态:
The hydroxide was neutralized by the acid. = 氢氧化物被酸中和了。

疑问句:
What is the chemical formula of this hydroxide? = 这种氢氧化物的化学式是什么？
Are all hydroxides soluble in water? = 所有氢氧化物都溶于水吗？


否定句:
This substance is not a hydroxide. = 此物质不是氢氧化物。
The solution did not contain any significant amount of hydroxide. = 该溶液不含任何显著量的氢氧化物。


PHRASE->

metal hydroxides = 金属氢氧化物
alkali hydroxides = 碱金属氢氧化物
soluble hydroxides = 可溶性氢氧化物
