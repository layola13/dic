词源:

* **ir-:**  Prefix meaning "not" or "without".
* **reverent:** Adjective meaning "feeling or showing deep respect".  This comes from the Old French *reverent* and ultimately from the Latin *revereri* meaning "to stand in awe of, to revere".
* **-ly:** Adverbial suffix.

Therefore, "irreverently" literally means "not reverently," indicating a lack of respect.
