USAGE->
This word is an adverb, not a noun, verb, or other part of speech.  Therefore, grammatical examples like those requested for "what" are not applicable.  The word itself describes a manner of speaking.


PHRASE->
This word doesn't readily form common phrases in the same way as a word like "what."  Its usage is primarily as a single adverb to modify a verb describing speech or communication.  Examples of phrases using it might include:


He spoke nongarrulously. = 他不爱说话。
She answered nongarrulously. = 她简短地回答了。
They debated nongarrulously. = 他们的辩论简明扼要。
The meeting proceeded nongarrulously. = 会议进行得简洁明了。
He responded nongarrulously to the question. = 他简短地回答了这个问题。


WORD ORIGIN->
The word "nongarrulously" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adverb "garrulously."  "Garrulously" in turn derives from the adjective "garrulous," which comes from the Late Latin word "garrulōsus," meaning "chattering" or "talkative."  The ultimate origin is likely the Latin word "garrire," meaning "to chatter" or "to prate."
