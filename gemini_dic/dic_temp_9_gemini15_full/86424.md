词源:  The word "heedlessly" derives from the Old English word "hēdan," meaning "to pay attention to," "to heed."  The addition of the suffix "-less" negates the meaning, resulting in "without heed" or "carelessly."  The adverbial suffix "-ly" further modifies it to describe how an action is performed.
