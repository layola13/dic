noninterpretabilities: /ˌnɒnɪnˌtɜːprɪtəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 不可解释性；难以理解的事物 | The inherent noninterpretabilities of quantum mechanics continue to fascinate and frustrate physicists. 量子力学的固有不可解释性继续吸引和挫败着物理学家们。 | 近义词：unintelligibilities, enigmas, mysteries | 反义词：understandabilities, explainabilities


This word is not found in standard dictionaries.  It's a newly coined word, likely formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") with "interpretabilities" (the plural of "interpretability," meaning the quality of being understandable or capable of interpretation).  Therefore, a complete etymological breakdown beyond this formation is not possible.
