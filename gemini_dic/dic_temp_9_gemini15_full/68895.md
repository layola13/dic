词源:

The word "fastidiously" derives from the Latin word "fastidium," meaning "weariness," "disgust," or "disdain."  Over time, the meaning shifted to describe a refined sensibility that found many things distasteful or undesirable, leading to the modern sense of meticulousness stemming from a high standard and intolerance of imperfection.  The "-ously" suffix transforms the adjective "fastidious" into an adverb, indicating the manner in which an action is performed.
