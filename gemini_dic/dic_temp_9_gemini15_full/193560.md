词源:

The word "self-alienation" is a compound word.  "Self" is from Old English *self, meaning "same" or "own." "Alienation" comes from the Latin word "alienatio," a combination of "alienus" (foreign, strange) and the suffix "-atio" (action or process).  Therefore, "self-alienation" literally means the process of becoming estranged from oneself.
