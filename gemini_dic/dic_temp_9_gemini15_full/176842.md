词源:The term "ready-made" comes from the French "objets trouvés" (found objects), a term popularized by Marcel Duchamp, a key figure in the Dada and Surrealist movements in the early 20th century.  He used the term to describe everyday objects that he selected and presented as art, challenging traditional notions of artistic creation.  The English term "ready-made" directly reflects the pre-manufactured nature of these objects.


用法说明:

The term "ready-mades" is primarily used in the context of art and art history. It refers to objects that are not created by the artist but are selected and presented as works of art, often with minimal alteration.  The artist's act of selection and presentation transforms the object's meaning and context, making it a work of art.
