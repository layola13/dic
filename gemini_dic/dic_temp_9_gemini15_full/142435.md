oscillancy:/ɒsɪˈleɪnsi/ | n. | 振荡性；摆动性 | The property or state of oscillating; the extent or degree to which something oscillates.  It refers to the tendency of something to move back and forth repeatedly or to vary between two states. | Example: The oscillancy of the pendulum was measured to be consistent.  摆的摆动性被测量为一致的。 |近义词：vibration, fluctuation, oscillation | 反义词：stability, steadiness


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The pendulum shows a high degree of oscillancy. = 钟摆显示出高度的振荡性。
The market exhibits significant oscillancy. = 市场表现出明显的波动性。


一般过去时:
The oscillancy of the machine was greater yesterday. = 昨天的机器振荡性更大。
The bridge showed unusual oscillancy during the storm. = 在暴风雨期间，桥梁显示出异常的摆动。


现在完成时:
The experiment has demonstrated considerable oscillancy in the data. = 实验已经证明数据存在相当大的波动。
The sensor has recorded significant oscillancy in the signal. = 传感器已记录到信号中明显的振荡。


过去完成时:
The engineer had noticed the increased oscillancy before the failure. = 工程师在故障发生前就已经注意到振荡性增强了。
The scientists had observed unusual oscillancy in the particle's trajectory. = 科学家们已经观察到粒子轨迹中异常的摆动。


将来时:
The system will exhibit less oscillancy after the upgrade. = 系统升级后将表现出较低的振荡性。
The new design will reduce the oscillancy of the engine. = 新的设计将减少发动机的振荡性。


虚拟语气:
If the oscillancy were less, the results would be more accurate. = 如果振荡性更小，结果将更准确。
I wish the oscillancy of the instrument were lower. = 我希望仪器的振荡性更低。


被动语态:
The oscillancy was measured using a high-precision instrument. = 振荡性是用高精度仪器测量的。
The oscillancy is being monitored continuously. = 振荡性正在持续监测中。


疑问句:
What is the oscillancy of the signal? = 信号的振荡性是多少？
How much oscillancy is acceptable in this application? = 在此应用中，可以接受多少振荡性？


否定句:
The system does not show significant oscillancy. = 系统没有显示明显的振荡性。
The data did not exhibit any unusual oscillancy. = 数据没有表现出任何异常的振荡性。


PHRASE->
degree of oscillancy: 振荡程度
rate of oscillancy: 振荡速率
amplitude of oscillancy: 振荡幅度
measure oscillancy: 测量振荡性
reduce oscillancy: 减少振荡性
