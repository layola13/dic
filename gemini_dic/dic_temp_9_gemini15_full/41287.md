The word "cordin" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Possible candidates depending on context might include "cordon," "coordinate," "cordial," or something else entirely.

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a slang term, or a word specific to a particular field or community.  More context is needed to understand its meaning.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a proper noun (name of a person, place, or thing).
