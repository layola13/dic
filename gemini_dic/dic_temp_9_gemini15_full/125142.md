词源:
The word "multitasking" is a modern compound word.  It combines "multi-", a prefix meaning "many" or "multiple," with "tasking," derived from the verb "to task," meaning to assign a task or to burden with work.  The term emerged in the context of computer science in the late 20th century, referring to a computer's ability to perform multiple operations seemingly simultaneously.  It later gained widespread usage to describe the human ability (or perceived ability) to do the same.
