词源:
The word "certainties" is derived from the adjective "certain," which comes from the Old French word "certain," meaning "sure, undoubted."  This, in turn, traces back to the Latin word "certus," meaning "sure, fixed, certain." The suffix "-ties" is a pluralizing suffix indicating a collection or state of being.
