词源:
The word "saviour" comes from the Old French "salvour," ultimately derived from the Latin "salvator," meaning "saviour" or "preserver."  The Latin word itself is derived from the verb "salvare," meaning "to save" or "to preserve."  The religious connotation of the word is strongly linked to its Latin roots and its use in describing Jesus Christ as the saviour of mankind.
