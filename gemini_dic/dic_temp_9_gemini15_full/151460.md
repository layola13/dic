/pærəˈstɒtɪk/ | adj. | 副骨的；副骨相关的 | Relating to or characterized by the presence of supernumerary bones (parostoses).  These are extra bones that develop near normal bones, often in the form of exostoses (bony outgrowths). Parostotic conditions can be caused by various factors, including genetic predisposition, trauma, or infection.  | Example: The radiograph revealed a parostotic lesion on the patient's tibia.  X光片显示患者胫骨上有一个副骨病变。 | 近义词:  exostotic (referring specifically to bony outgrowths) | 反义词:  N/A (lack of supernumerary bones isn't a readily defined opposite)
