词源:  The word derives from the noun "revenge," ultimately from Old French *vengance (modern French vengeance), from Vulgar Latin *vindicantia, from Latin vindicta ("revenge, punishment"). The suffix "-ingly" is an adverbial suffix, indicating manner or way.  Therefore, "revengingly" means "in a manner characteristic of revenge."
