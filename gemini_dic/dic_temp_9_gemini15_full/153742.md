词源:
The word "pepperish" is derived from "pepper," referring to the spice, with the suffix "-ish" indicating a slight or somewhat quality.  Thus, it literally means "somewhat like pepper" in terms of spiciness or pungency, and figuratively, it means somewhat irritable or easily angered, likely due to the association of pepper's strong flavor with a strong or fiery temperament.
