词源:
The word "quasi-courteous" is a compound word.  "Quasi" is from Latin, meaning "as if," "apparently," or "seemingly."  "Courteous" comes from the Old French "courtois," related to the word "court," suggesting politeness associated with courtly behavior.  Therefore, "quasi-courteous" literally means "seemingly courteous."
