/ˈprɛsɪŋnəsɪz/ | n. |紧迫性；迫切性 |The pressingness of the situation demanded immediate action.  情况的紧迫性要求立即采取行动。| urgency, importance | complacency, nonchalance | 名词


The word "pressingness's" is not a standard English word.  It's an unusual construction, attempting to make the noun "pressingness" possessive.  While grammatically possible, it's awkward and unnatural.  It would be much better to rephrase the sentence to avoid this construction.  For example, instead of "the pressingness's of the deadline," one would say "the pressing nature of the deadline" or "the urgency of the deadline."


Therefore, we will analyze "pressingness" instead:


/ˈprɛsɪŋnəs/ | n. |紧迫性；迫切性 |The pressingness of the deadline made him work late into the night. 截止日期的紧迫性使他工作到深夜。| urgency, importance | complacency, nonchalance | 名词
