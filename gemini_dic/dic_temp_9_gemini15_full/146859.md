词源:
The word "overindustrialism" is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessive or too much) and "industrialism" (referring to the system of industrial production and organization).  "Industrialism" itself derives from "industry," ultimately from the Latin "industria" (skill, diligence, assiduity).  Therefore, "overindustrialism" literally means an excessive level of industrial activity.
