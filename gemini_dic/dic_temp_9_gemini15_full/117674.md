meionite:/ˈmaɪənaɪt/| n. |镁铝榴石|A calcium aluminum silicate mineral, a member of the melilite group. It's typically found in contact metamorphic rocks and is often associated with other calcium-rich minerals.  It can vary in color from colorless to yellowish, grayish, or greenish. |Example: The geologist identified meionite crystals within the sample of contact metamorphic rock. 地质学家在接触变质岩样本中发现了镁铝榴石晶体。|近义词：gehlenite (another melilite group mineral)|反义词：无
