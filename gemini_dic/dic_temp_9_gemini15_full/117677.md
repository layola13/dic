meiostemonous: /ˌmaɪoʊˈstɛmənəs/ | adj. | 少雄蕊的 | Having fewer stamens than the sepals or petals.  This term is primarily used in botany to describe flowers with a reduced number of stamens compared to the number of other floral parts, such as petals or sepals.  The reduced number of stamens can be due to various genetic or environmental factors.  The exact number of stamens considered "few" is relative to the species and its typical floral structure.


例句：

The flower exhibits a meiostemonous condition, possessing only five stamens despite having ten petals. =  这朵花呈现少雄蕊的状态，尽管有十个花瓣，却只有五个雄蕊。

Many species in this genus are characterized by their meiostemonous flowers. =  这个属的许多物种都以其少雄蕊的花朵为特征。
