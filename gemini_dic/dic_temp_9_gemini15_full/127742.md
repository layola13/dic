词源:
From Old French *negociacion, from Latin negotiatio "business, trade," from negotiari "to trade, carry on business," from negotium "business, occupation," from nec + otium "not + leisure."  The core meaning involves the busy activity of commerce and thus evolved to encompass the process of discussion and compromise inherent in deal-making.
