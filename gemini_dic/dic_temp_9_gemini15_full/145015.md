excessively sophisticated
unnecessarily complex

beyond the current capabilities


词源:

The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and "advanced" (meaning "far along in development or progress").  Therefore, it's a relatively recent and informal term, not found in traditional dictionaries, reflecting a modern concern about the potential downsides of rapid technological progress.
