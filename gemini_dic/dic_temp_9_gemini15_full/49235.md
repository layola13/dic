词源:  The word "delegitimize" is a relatively modern coinage, formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove or reverse") to "legitimize".  "Legitimize" itself comes from "legitimate," derived from the Latin "legitimus," meaning "lawful" or "according to law," ultimately from "lex," meaning "law."
