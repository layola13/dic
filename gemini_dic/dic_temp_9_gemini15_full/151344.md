词源:
The word "parked" comes from the verb "park," which entered English in the late 16th century.  Its ultimate origin is from the Old French word "parquer," meaning "to enclose," "to impound," or "to confine within an enclosure."  This relates to the original meaning of "park" as a reserved area, and the extension of the verb to mean placing a vehicle in a designated spot is a later development.
