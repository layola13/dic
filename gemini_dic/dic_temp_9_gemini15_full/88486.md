词源:
The word "historicism" comes from the German word "Historismus," which emerged in the 19th century. It combines the word "history" with the suffix "-ism," indicating a doctrine or system of thought.  The term initially referred to a specific approach to historical study emphasizing the uniqueness of historical periods and rejecting universalizing frameworks. However, its meaning has evolved to encompass broader perspectives on the role of history in shaping social, cultural, and intellectual life.
