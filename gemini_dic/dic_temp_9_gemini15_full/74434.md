francium: /ˈfrænsiəm/ | n. |钫| Francium is a chemical element with the symbol Fr and atomic number 87.  It is an extremely rare, radioactive metal. It is the second-least electronegative element, after caesium.  Because of its extreme rarity and short half-life, there are very limited practical applications for francium. | The discovery of francium completed the seventh row of the periodic table. | 近义词: None (due to its unique properties)| 反义词: None (due to its unique properties)|  名词
