quasi-confining: /ˈkwɑːzaɪ kənˈfaɪnɪŋ/ | adj. | 准约束的，近似约束的 |  Describes a system or condition that partially restricts or confines something, but not completely.  It implies a degree of freedom or openness remains despite the limitations. | Example: The quasi-confining potential of the magnetic field allowed some particles to escape.  准约束的磁场使得一些粒子能够逃逸。 | 近义词：partially confining, semi-confined, restricted | 反义词：unconfined, free, unrestricted |
