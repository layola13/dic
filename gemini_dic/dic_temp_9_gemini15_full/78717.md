gigawatt:/ˈɡɪɡəˌwɑːt/|/ˈɡɪɡəˌwɒt/| n. |吉瓦（功率单位）|A gigawatt (GW) is a unit of power equal to one billion watts. It's commonly used to measure the output of large power plants, such as nuclear power stations or hydroelectric dams.  |The new nuclear power plant is expected to generate 10 gigawatts of electricity.|近义词：billion watts|反义词：milliwatt, kilowatt


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The power plant generates 5 gigawatts of electricity. = 这个发电厂发电5吉瓦。
This reactor produces a steady stream of gigawatts. = 这个反应堆稳定地产生吉瓦的能量。


一般过去时:
The old plant generated only 2 gigawatts. = 旧电厂只发电2吉瓦。
Yesterday's peak power output reached 12 gigawatts. = 昨天的峰值电力输出达到12吉瓦。


现在完成时:
The company has invested billions in gigawatt-scale renewable energy projects. = 该公司已投资数十亿美元用于吉瓦规模的可再生能源项目。
They have successfully upgraded the plant to produce more gigawatts. = 他们已成功升级发电厂以产生更多吉瓦的电力。


过去完成时:
Before the upgrade, the plant had only produced 5 gigawatts. = 在升级之前，该电厂只产生5吉瓦的电力。
They had underestimated the potential for gigawatt-scale wind farms. = 他们低估了吉瓦级风力发电场的潜力。


将来时:
The new solar farm will generate 1 gigawatt of power. = 新的太阳能农场将发电1吉瓦。
We will need to invest heavily to achieve gigawatt-scale energy storage. = 我们需要大力投资才能实现吉瓦规模的储能。


虚拟语气:
If we had more funding, we could build a gigawatt-scale solar farm. = 如果我们有更多资金，我们就能建造一个吉瓦规模的太阳能农场。
I wish we could harness that much power in gigawatts. = 我希望我们能够利用这么多吉瓦的电力。


被动语态:
Several gigawatts of power are generated by the dam. = 水坝发电几吉瓦。
A significant amount of energy, measured in gigawatts, is consumed daily. = 每天消耗大量的能量，以吉瓦为单位计算。


疑问句:
How many gigawatts does the power plant produce? = 该电厂产生多少吉瓦的电力？
What is the peak power output in gigawatts? = 峰值电力输出是多少吉瓦？


否定句:
The plant does not produce enough gigawatts to meet demand. = 该电厂产生的吉瓦数不足以满足需求。
The project failed to reach its target of 10 gigawatts. = 该项目未能达到10吉瓦的目标。


PHRASE->
gigawatt-scale power plants = 吉瓦级发电厂
peak gigawatt output = 峰值吉瓦输出
gigawatt-hour = 吉瓦时
renewable gigawatts = 可再生能源吉瓦
nuclear gigawatts = 核能吉瓦
