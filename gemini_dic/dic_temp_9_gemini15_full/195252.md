词源：

* **semi-**:  Prefix meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."  From Latin *semi*.

* **figurative**: Adjective meaning "using figures of speech," "metaphorical," or "not literal."  Derived from the noun "figure" (a figure of speech), ultimately from Latin *figura* ("shape," "form").

* **-ness**: Suffix forming nouns of state or quality. From Old English *-nes.


因此，semifigurativeness 结合了 "semi-" (部分的) 和 "figurative" (比喻的) ，以及 "-ness" (状态) ，表示部分使用比喻修辞的语言风格或状态。
