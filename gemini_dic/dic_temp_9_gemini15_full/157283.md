词源:

The word "pin" comes from the Old English word "pinne," meaning "peg" or "small stick."  This reflects the early use of pins as simple wooden or bone fasteners. Over time, the material changed to metal, but the word persisted.  The modern spelling and pronunciation evolved through Middle English.
