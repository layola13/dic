gallfly:/ˈɡɔːlflaɪ/ | n. | 瘿蜂 | A gallfly is any insect of the order Hymenoptera that causes the formation of galls, usually on plants.  Galls are abnormal growths of plant tissue, often caused by the insect's larvae feeding on the plant.  Different species of gallflies create different types of galls, varying in size, shape, and location on the plant. | Example: The oak tree was covered in galls, evidence of a gallfly infestation.  橡树上长满了虫瘿，这是瘿蜂侵染的证据。 | 近义词: gall wasp, cynipid | 反义词:  (无直接反义词，可考虑与“normal plant growth”相对)
