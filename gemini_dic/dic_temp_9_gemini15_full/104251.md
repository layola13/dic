词源：

The word "jury" comes from the Old French word "jure," meaning "oath."  This reflects the historical and ongoing practice of jurors swearing an oath to deliver a just verdict based on the evidence presented.  The Old French "jure" ultimately derives from the Latin word "jurare," meaning "to swear."
