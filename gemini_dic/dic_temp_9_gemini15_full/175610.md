词性：形容词


词源：源自range (n.) "一系列，范围"，加上形容词后缀-iest 表示最高级。The word evolved from the Old French word "range," meaning "row" or "rank," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "rengo," meaning "I arrange" or "I set in a row."  The addition of "-iest" creates the superlative form, indicating the greatest extent of range.
