photochromotype:/ˈfoʊtoʊkroʊmoʊtaɪp/ | n. | 彩色照片，彩色照片印刷品 | A photochromotype is a type of color photograph produced using a photomechanical process.  It involves creating a series of photographic negatives, each capturing a different color component of the image, which are then combined to create a full-color print. The process was popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. | Example:  The museum displayed a stunning photochromotype of a Victorian-era London street scene.  = 博物馆展示了一张令人惊叹的维多利亚时代伦敦街景的彩色照片印刷品。


The process was quite complex, requiring multiple exposures and careful registration of the color separations.  A photochromotype is a type of color photograph, not a digital image. = 这个过程相当复杂，需要多次曝光并仔细校准色彩分离。彩色照片是一种彩色照片，而不是数字图像。|近义词：color photograph, chromolithograph |反义词：monochrome photograph
