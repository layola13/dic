词源:
The word "meddle" comes from the Middle English word "meddlen," which means "to mix or interfere." This, in turn, derives from the Old English word "mæddlian,"  which had similar meanings, often implying a clumsy or inappropriate mixing.  The modern usage retains the sense of unwanted interference.
