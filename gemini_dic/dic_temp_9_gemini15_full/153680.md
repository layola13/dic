词源:

The word "peon" comes from the Spanish word "peón," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "pedonem," the accusative singular of "pedo," meaning "foot soldier" or "pawn."  The Spanish word evolved to refer to a foot soldier, then to an unskilled laborer, and eventually to the specific meaning of an indebted agricultural worker.  The English word adopted this meaning and expanded it to include low-level employees in a broader context.
