词源:

The word "junky" ultimately derives from the earlier word "junk," meaning something of little value or worthless trash.  The association with drug addiction arose in the mid-20th century, likely stemming from the low quality and often impure nature of the drugs available on the street. The use of "junky" to describe a person addicted to drugs carries a strong negative connotation and is often considered offensive.
