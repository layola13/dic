Etymology:

The word "floweriness" derives directly from the word "flower" and the suffix "-iness," which denotes a quality or state of being.  "Flower" comes from the Old English word *flōwer*, which itself has roots in Proto-Germanic and beyond.  The "-iness" suffix is a common English derivational suffix indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, "floweriness" literally means "the state of being flowery" or having the qualities associated with flowers, such as abundance, beauty, and sometimes excessive decoration.
