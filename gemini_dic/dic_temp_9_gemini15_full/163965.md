词源:  The word "predictably" derives from the adjective "predictable," which in turn comes from the verb "predict."  "Predict" originates from the Latin word "praedicere," which means "to say beforehand" or "to foretell." The prefix "prae-" means "before," and "dicere" means "to say."  Therefore, "predictably" signifies that something happens in a manner that can be foretold or anticipated based on prior knowledge or experience.
