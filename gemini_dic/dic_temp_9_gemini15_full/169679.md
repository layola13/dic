词源:
The word "proposed" comes from the Old French word "proposer," meaning "to propose, put forward."  This in turn is derived from the Latin word "proponere," which is a combination of the prefix "pro-" (forward) and "ponere" (to put, place).  Therefore, the root meaning points to the act of putting something forward for consideration.
