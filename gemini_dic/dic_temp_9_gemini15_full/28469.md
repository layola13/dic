carburizing:/ˈkɑːrbəraɪzɪŋ/| v. |渗碳，使渗碳|The process of increasing the carbon content of the surface of a metal object, typically steel, by heating it in a carbon-rich environment. This increases the hardness and wear resistance of the surface. |例句：The gears were carburized to improve their durability.  齿轮经过渗碳处理以提高其耐用性。
The steel components underwent a carburizing process before final assembly. 钢制部件在最终组装前进行了渗碳处理。|近义词：case-hardening, carbonizing |反义词：decarburizing
