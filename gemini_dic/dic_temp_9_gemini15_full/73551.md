forestaff: /ˈfɔːrˌstæf/ | n. | 前视标尺；(测量仪器的)前视杆 | A forestaff is an ancient navigational instrument used to measure the altitude of celestial bodies, primarily the sun.  It consists of a graduated staff with a sighting vane at one end and a shadow vane at the other. By aligning the sun with the vanes, the user could determine its altitude above the horizon.  This altitude, along with the time of day, could then be used to calculate latitude. | Example:  The captain used a forestaff to determine their latitude during the long sea voyage.  | 近义词: astrolabe, quadrant | 反义词: None specifically.
