词源:
The word "paddock" comes from the Old French word "padoc," meaning "enclosure," which in turn is thought to derive from the Latin word "pactum," meaning "agreement" or "covenant," referring to an area enclosed by agreement.  The evolution of the word shows a shift in meaning from a general enclosure to a specific type of small field, particularly for livestock.
