词源:
The word "rash" ultimately derives from Old French *rasche, meaning "a rush," referring to the speed or suddenness of the eruption.  The modern meaning of rash as a skin condition developed through a semantic shift.  The meaning of "reckless" also developed from this root, reflecting the impulsive nature associated with both a sudden eruption and a hasty decision.
