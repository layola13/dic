The word "quinizine" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries like Merriam-Webster, Oxford English Dictionary, or Cambridge Dictionary.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis according to the requested format.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a technical term from a highly specialized field, or a word from a fictional language.
