词源:

The word "conservatism" originated in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. It is derived from the Latin word "conservare," meaning "to preserve," "to keep," or "to maintain."  The suffix "-ism" denotes a doctrine, belief system, or practice.  Thus, conservatism literally means the belief or practice of preserving or maintaining existing institutions and traditions.  Its development as a distinct political ideology is closely tied to reactions against the French Revolution and the Enlightenment's emphasis on radical change.


用法说明:

Conservatism can refer to a broad range of political, social, and economic philosophies.  While generally associated with maintaining the status quo, its specific tenets can vary across different contexts and historical periods.  For instance, fiscal conservatism often emphasizes limited government spending and lower taxes, while social conservatism typically focuses on upholding traditional moral values and institutions.  It's important to note that conservatism is not monolithic; there are diverse schools of thought within the broader conservative movement.
