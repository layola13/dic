词源:

The word "martyrizing" derives from the noun "martyr," which comes from the Greek word "μάρτυς" (mártys), meaning "witness."  Early Christians who died for their faith were called martyrs because they bore witness to their beliefs through their death. Over time, the meaning broadened to include anyone who suffers greatly for a cause, and "martyrizing" became the verb form describing the act of causing such suffering.
