词源:
The word "enlist" comes from the Old French word "enlister," meaning "to enroll" or "to register."  This, in turn, derives from the prefix "en-" (meaning "in" or "into") and the Old French word "liste," meaning "list" or "roll."  The original sense was thus to add someone's name to a list, often a military register.
