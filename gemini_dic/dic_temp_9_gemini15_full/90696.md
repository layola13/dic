词源:
The word "humdrumnesses" is derived from "humdrum," which itself is of uncertain origin.  Some etymologists suggest a possible connection to the Old English word "hom," meaning "home," combined with a word related to "drum," suggesting a monotonous, repetitive sound, like a steady drumbeat. The "-ness" suffix indicates a state or condition. Therefore, "humdrumnesses" refers to the state or condition of being filled with humdrum things, or the collective aspects of monotonous routines.
