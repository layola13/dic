omniparity:/ˌɒmnɪˈpærɪti/| n. |全同性，普遍平等|The state of being equally distributed or having equal parity;  often used in the context of biological or ecological systems to describe equal reproductive success among individuals or groups.|Example: The study aimed to demonstrate omniparity in the breeding success of the different bird species. 这项研究旨在证明不同鸟类的繁殖成功率是均等的。|近义词：equality, equivalence, uniformity|反义词：inequality, disparity


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Omniparity exists in some insect populations. = 在某些昆虫种群中存在着全同性。
This model assumes omniparity among the competing species. = 这个模型假设竞争物种之间存在全同性。


一般过去时:
Researchers observed omniparity in the data set. = 研究人员在数据集中观察到了全同性。
The previous study did not demonstrate omniparity. = 先前的研究没有证明全同性。


现在完成时:
Scientists have found evidence of omniparity in several ecosystems. = 科学家们在几个生态系统中发现了全同性的证据。
Studies have shown that omniparity is rare in many animal populations. = 研究表明，在许多动物种群中，全同性是罕见的。


过去完成时:
Before the intervention, omniparity had not been observed. = 在干预之前，没有观察到全同性。
They had expected to find omniparity, but the results were different. = 他们原本期望发现全同性，但结果却不同。


将来时:
Future research will explore the conditions that lead to omniparity. = 未来的研究将探索导致全同性的条件。
We will investigate whether omniparity is maintained under different environmental conditions. = 我们将研究全同性是否在不同的环境条件下保持不变。


虚拟语气:
If omniparity existed, the population dynamics would be very different. = 如果存在全同性，那么种群动态将大相径庭。
It is unlikely that perfect omniparity would ever be observed in nature. = 在自然界中不太可能观察到完美的全同性。


被动语态:
Omniparity was observed in the experimental group. = 在实验组中观察到了全同性。
The conditions leading to omniparity are still being studied. = 导致全同性的条件仍在研究中。


疑问句:
Does omniparity exist in this species? = 这种物种中存在全同性吗？
What factors contribute to omniparity? = 哪些因素促成了全同性？


否定句:
Omniparity is not always present in natural populations. = 全同性并不总是存在于自然种群中。
The data did not support the hypothesis of omniparity. = 数据不支持全同性的假设。


PHRASE->

There are no common phrases directly using "omniparity"  as it is a relatively specialized term.  Phrases would be built around the concept, such as:

equal reproductive success = 均等的繁殖成功率
uniform distribution = 均匀分布
lack of reproductive skew = 缺乏生殖倾斜
absence of dominance hierarchy = 缺乏支配等级
even distribution of resources = 资源的均匀分布
