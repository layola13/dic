词源:

The word "hypnotherapy" is a combination of "hypno" (from "hypnosis") and "therapy."  "Hypnosis" itself originates from the Greek word "hypnos," meaning "sleep."  The suffix "-therapy" comes from the Greek word "therapeia," meaning "healing" or "treatment."  Therefore, hypnotherapy literally means "healing through sleep" or "treatment using hypnosis," though the modern understanding of hypnosis doesn't necessarily involve sleep.
