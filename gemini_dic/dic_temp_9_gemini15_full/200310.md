词源:
The word "skulduggery"  is of uncertain origin, but it's likely a blend of "skull" (suggesting something deceptive or cunning) and perhaps "dug" or a similar word implying digging up something illicit or hidden.  The "ery" suffix is a common addition to words to denote a state or practice.  It emerged in the 19th century.
