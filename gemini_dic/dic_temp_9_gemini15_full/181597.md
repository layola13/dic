relationist: /rɪˈleɪʃənɪst/ | adj. n. | 关系论者；关系主义者 |  A relationist is someone who holds a relationist view in philosophy, particularly in the philosophy of space and time.  Relationism asserts that spatial and temporal relations are fundamental, and that space and time themselves are not.  A relationist would argue that the location of an object is defined only by its relationship to other objects, and not by its position in some independent, pre-existing space.  | Example:  Einstein's theory of relativity is often interpreted as supporting a relationist view of space and time.  Many philosophers consider Einstein a relationist, although this is debated. | 近义词: relationalist | 反义词: substantivalist (in the context of space and time) |  adj./n.
