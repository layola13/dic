词源:
The word "seedily" derives from the adjective "seedy," which, in its earliest uses, referred to something resembling seeds—small, numerous, and perhaps somewhat scattered. Over time, this evolved into a connotation of shabbiness, decay, and moral dubiousness, likely associated with places like dilapidated lodging houses or disreputable establishments.  The "-ily" suffix transforms the adjective "seedy" into an adverb, modifying the manner or way in which something is done or appears.
