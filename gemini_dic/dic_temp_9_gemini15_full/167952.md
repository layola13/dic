prions:/ˈpraɪɒnz/ | n. |朊病毒 | Infectious protein particles that cause neurodegenerative diseases.  Prions are misfolded proteins that can induce normal proteins to misfold, leading to the accumulation of abnormal prion proteins in the brain and causing damage. | Example:  Mad cow disease is caused by prions.  疯牛病是由朊病毒引起的。  The study of prions is crucial to understanding certain fatal neurological diseases.  对朊病毒的研究对于理解某些致命的神经系统疾病至关重要。|近义词:infectious agents (a broader term)|反义词:None.
