词源:
The word "dismettled" is not found in standard dictionaries. It appears to be a less common or possibly archaic variation or a neologism (newly coined word) formed from "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and a root related to "mettle" (courage or spirit).  The meaning reflects the loss or lack of mettle.
