doughbird: /ˈdoʊbɜːrd/ | n. | 笨蛋，傻瓜 |  There is no established meaning for "doughbird" in standard English dictionaries. It appears to be a nonce word, a word coined for a specific occasion or context, possibly a humorous or informal term.  It's likely a playful combination of "dough" (referring to something soft, malleable, or easily manipulated) and "bird" (often used informally to refer to a person, sometimes with a negative connotation). The exact meaning would depend entirely on the context in which it's used. |  例句： (由于没有标准含义，无法提供例句) | 近义词: (根据推测的含义) fool, idiot, simpleton | 反义词: (根据推测的含义) genius, brilliant, clever | n.
