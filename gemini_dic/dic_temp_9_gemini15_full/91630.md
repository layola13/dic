hyperbaton:/haɪˈpɜːrbətɒn/| n. | 颠倒句法，移就 |  A figure of speech in which words are arranged out of their normal order to achieve a particular effect, often for emphasis or to create a more poetic or dramatic effect.  It involves disrupting the expected grammatical structure of a sentence. | Example:  "Alone he walked." (instead of "He walked alone.")  This emphasizes the solitude. | 近义词：inversion, anastrophe | 反义词：standard word order


例句：

"The road went on forever, or so it seemed."  这条路似乎永远延伸下去。 (The normal order would be "Or so it seemed, the road went on forever.")

"Every day, I think of you." 我每天都在想你。(Normal order might be "I think of you every day.")
