词源:  The word comes from "honky-tonk," which itself is of uncertain origin, but likely a blend of onomatopoeic elements suggesting the sound of boisterous music and possibly a reference to the "honky-tonk piano" style of playing.  The "-ing" suffix transforms it into a gerund, denoting the act of doing so.
