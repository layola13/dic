Word Origin:

The word "patheticalness" is derived from the adjective "pathetical," which in turn comes from the Late Latin word "patheticus," meaning "passionate, feeling."  This ultimately originates from the Greek word "pathētikos," meaning "capable of suffering," "subject to feeling," or "passionate."  The suffix "-ness" is added to form a noun, signifying the quality or state of being pathetic.
