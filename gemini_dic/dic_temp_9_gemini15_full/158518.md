词源:

From Middle English *plentetude, borrowed from Old French *plentude, from Latin plēnitūdō, from plēnus “full”.


用法说明:

Plentitude is primarily used as a noun. It emphasizes a large quantity or abundance, often suggesting a fullness or completeness.  It is often used in a more formal or literary context than simpler words like "abundance" or "plenty."  The word implies not just a large quantity, but also a richness or fullness of something.
