PHRASE->
Because "phallus" is a noun with strong connotations, it's less frequently used in common phrases.  Instead of phrases *with* "phallus," it's more common to find phrases that are *related* to the concept of phallus or male sexuality.  Examples could include idioms related to masculinity or potency, but these would not directly include the word "phallus".  For example:  "He's got a lot of nerve" (implying boldness associated with masculinity).  However, a direct phrasal usage is difficult to construct naturally.
