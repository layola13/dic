词源:
The word "eying" comes directly from the noun "eye," meaning the organ of sight.  The "-ing" suffix transforms the noun into a present participle, functioning as a verb, indicating the act of using one's eyes in a specific way, often with intention or focus.  The etymology of "eye" itself traces back to Old English "ēage," from Proto-Germanic "*augō," and ultimately to Proto-Indo-European "*okʷ-," meaning "eye."
