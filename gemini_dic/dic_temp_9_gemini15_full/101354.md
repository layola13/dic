ionicities:/ˌaɪɒnɪˈsɪtiz/ | n. |离子性，离子度|The degree to which a compound exhibits ionic character, representing the extent of electron transfer between atoms in a bond.  It's a measure of how much a chemical bond resembles a purely ionic bond.| The high ionicity of sodium chloride (NaCl) explains its high melting point and solubility in water.  高氯化钠（NaCl）的离子性解释了其高熔点和水溶性。 The ionicity of a bond can be predicted based on the electronegativity difference between the atoms involved.  键的离子性可以根据所涉及原子的电负性差异来预测。|近义词：ionic character, polarity|反义词：covalency
