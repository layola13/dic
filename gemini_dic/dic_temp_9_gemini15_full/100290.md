词源:
The word "insert" comes from the Old French word "inserer," which means "to put in."  This, in turn, is derived from the Latin word "inserere," which is a compound of "in-" (into) and "serere" (to join, to sow, to plant).  The meaning has evolved consistently, maintaining its core sense of placing something within something else.
