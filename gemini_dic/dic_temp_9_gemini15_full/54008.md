词源:

The word "discriminatory" is derived from the verb "discriminate," which comes from the Latin word "discriminare," meaning "to distinguish between" or "to separate."  The prefix "dis-" indicates separation or negation, while the root "-criminare" is related to the Latin word "crimen," meaning "judgment" or "accusation."  Over time, "discriminate" acquired a negative connotation, referring to making unfair distinctions between people.  "Discriminatory" is simply the adjectival form of "discriminate," describing something that involves such unfair distinctions.
