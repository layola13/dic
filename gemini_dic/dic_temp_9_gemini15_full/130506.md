英文解析：Nonaccidentalnesses is a noun referring to the quality or state of not being accidental; the characteristic of being inevitable or certain. It emphasizes the lack of randomness or chance in occurrences.  The word is quite uncommon, formed by adding the prefix "non-" to "accidentalness," which itself is not a frequently used word.

例句：

The intricate design of the watch, with its perfectly functioning parts, points to the nonaccidentalnesses of its creation.  手表的精巧设计及其完美运作的部件，指向其创造的必然性。


The repeated occurrences of the phenomenon defy explanation as mere coincidence, suggesting underlying nonaccidentalnesses.  这种现象的反复出现无法解释为单纯的巧合，暗示着潜在的必然性。


词源：

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not."
* **accidental**:  Adjective meaning "happening by chance; unexpected."
* **-ness**: A suffix forming nouns of state or quality.

Therefore, "nonaccidentalnesses" is a noun built from negating the quality of "accidentality."  The repeated "-ness" suffix further emphasizes the multiple instances or aspects of this non-accidental nature.

用法说明：

Due to its uncommon nature and somewhat awkward construction, "nonaccidentalnesses" is rarely used in everyday language or formal writing.  More concise and common alternatives exist to convey the same meaning, such as "inevitability," "certainty," or describing the specific factors that make the events non-accidental.  Using the word would sound overly formal and potentially pedantic in most contexts.
