词源:
From Greek *dithyrambos, of uncertain origin, perhaps connected with dithuros "two-doored," referring to the double doors of a temple where the dithyrambs were performed.  The word ultimately refers to ancient Greek choral lyric poetry in honor of Dionysus, characterized by wild enthusiasm and unrestrained expression.
