词源:
The word "fasted" comes from the Old English word "fæstan," meaning "to abstain from food."  This is related to the Proto-Germanic word "*fastan," and ultimately traces back to Proto-Indo-European roots related to holding or binding.  The sense of "speed" is a later development, likely connected to the idea of something moving quickly without being slowed by food.
