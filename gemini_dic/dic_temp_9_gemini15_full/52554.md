diffracting:/dɪˈfræktɪŋ/ | adj. |衍射的；发生衍射的 |  Describes the process or phenomenon of diffraction, where waves spread out after passing through an aperture or around an obstacle.  | Example: The diffracting light created an interference pattern on the screen.  衍射的光在屏幕上产生了干涉图样。 |近义词：bending, scattering | 反义词：None specifically, but the opposite concept would be rectilinear propagation (straight-line propagation).


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The light is diffracting around the edges of the obstacle. = 光正在障碍物的边缘发生衍射。
Diffraction patterns are commonly observed in wave phenomena. = 波现象中普遍观察到衍射图案。


一般过去时:

The light diffracted as it passed through the slit. = 光穿过狭缝时发生了衍射。


现在完成时:
The researchers have studied the diffracting properties of various materials. = 研究人员已经研究了各种材料的衍射特性。
Scientists have observed many examples of light diffracting. = 科学家已经观察到许多光衍射的例子。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, the team had anticipated the diffracting effect. = 在实验之前，团队已经预料到了衍射效应。
The students had learned about diffracting waves in their physics class. = 学生们在物理课上学习了关于衍射波的知识。


将来时:
The laser beam will diffract as it encounters the grating. = 激光束遇到光栅时将会发生衍射。

疑问句:
Is the light diffracting? = 光正在衍射吗？
How much does the sound diffract in this environment? = 在这种环境中，声音衍射的程度有多大？


否定句:
The light did not diffract significantly in this case. = 在这种情况下，光没有发生明显的衍射。
The waves were not diffracting as expected. = 波浪没有像预期那样发生衍射。
