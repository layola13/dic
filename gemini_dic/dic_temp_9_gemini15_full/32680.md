词源:
The word "chivvy" likely originated as a dialectal variant of "chivie," which in turn may be related to the Middle English word "chive," meaning "to drive or chase."  The exact etymological path is uncertain, but the core meaning of urging or driving someone forward is consistent throughout its variations.
