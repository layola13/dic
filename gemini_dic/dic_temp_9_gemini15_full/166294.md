词源:
The word "prereconciling" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the verb "reconciling" (the act of making consistent or matching).  "Reconciling" itself comes from the verb "reconcile," derived from the Old French "reconcilier" and ultimately from the Latin "reconciliare," meaning "to restore to friendship," "to bring into harmony."  In the accounting context, it means to bring different records into agreement.
