词源:

The word "overtolerant" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the adjective "tolerant."  "Tolerant" comes from the Latin word "tolerans," the present participle of "tolerare," meaning "to bear," "to endure," or "to put up with."  Therefore, "overtolerant" literally means "excessively bearing" or "excessively enduring."
