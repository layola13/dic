词源:  The word "cashable" is derived from the noun "cash" and the suffix "-able," meaning "capable of being."  "Cash" itself originates from the Old French "caisse," meaning "chest" or "box," referring to a container for money. The evolution reflects the historical association of cash with physical storage and ready exchange.
