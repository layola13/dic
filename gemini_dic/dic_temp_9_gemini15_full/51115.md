词源:
The word "despisal" comes from the verb "despise," which is derived from the Old French word "despiser," meaning "to scorn" or "to contemn."  The Old French word itself traces back to the Latin word "despicere," which means "to look down upon" or "to scorn."  The "-al" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, indicating the state or action of despising.
