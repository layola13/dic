词源：
The word "perroquet" is derived from the Old French word "pericoquet," which itself originates from the Portuguese word "periquito," ultimately coming from the Tupi word "periquito," a native Brazilian word for a type of small parrot.  The word's journey reflects the early European contact with parrots in South America and the spread of these birds and the word itself across the globe.
