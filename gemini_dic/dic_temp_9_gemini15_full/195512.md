This word is extremely rare and not found in standard dictionaries. It's formed by combining:

* **semi-:**  A prefix meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."
* **passive-:**  Relating to the grammatical voice indicating that the subject receives the action of the verb.  It can also refer to a state of being inactive or unresponsive.
* **-ness:** A suffix forming nouns of state, condition, or quality.
* **-es:** A plural suffix.


Therefore, "semipassivenesses" refers to multiple instances or aspects of a state that is only partly passive. It suggests a situation where something is partially inactive, unresponsive, or exhibiting characteristics of passivity but not completely so.  The word is likely to be found only in highly specialized technical contexts.

Because of its rarity and specialized nature, providing example sentences across various grammatical tenses and moods is impractical.  The single example above demonstrates its core meaning. There are no readily available synonyms or antonyms for this highly specific term.  The closest you could come would be to describe the individual instances of partial passivity that compose the plural "semipassivenesses," rather than attempting to find a single word replacement.
