halflife:/ˈhɑːflaɪf/| n. |半衰期；半生期 |The time it takes for half of a radioactive substance to decay.  It is also used figuratively to describe the time it takes for something to lose half its value or effectiveness.|例句：The half-life of carbon-14 is approximately 5,730 years. 碳14的半衰期大约是5730年。

The drug has a short half-life, requiring frequent doses.  这种药物的半衰期很短，需要频繁服用。|近义词：decay rate,  (figuratively) duration |反义词：full life, complete duration
