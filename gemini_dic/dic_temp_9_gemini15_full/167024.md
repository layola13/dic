/ˌpriːsəkˈsɛsɪz/ | n. |前期成功；先前的成功 |  This word is not a standard English word.  It's a newly coined word, formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before) and "successes" (plural of success). It refers to achievements or accomplishments that happened before a particular point in time or before a more significant success.  There is no established dictionary definition or widely accepted usage.  Therefore, providing examples of grammatical usage, synonyms, antonyms, etc., is not possible.  The word would need to be understood within the specific context where it is used.  The author likely intended to convey the idea of prior successes leading up to a greater achievement.
