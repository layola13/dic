词源:
Old French *deceyvre, from deceivre "to deceive," from des- "away, from" + ceivre "to catch, seize" (related to Latin capere "to take, seize").  The modern sense developed from the original meaning of "to capture, ensnare," emphasizing the element of trickery involved in catching someone unaware.
