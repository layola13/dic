词源:

The word "shirred" comes from the Old French word "chirrer," meaning "to gather, wrinkle, or crease."  This ultimately derives from the Proto-Germanic root *hreiwō-, meaning "wrinkle" or "fold".  The culinary usage likely evolved from the visual similarity between pleated fabric and the appearance of eggs cooked in this manner.
