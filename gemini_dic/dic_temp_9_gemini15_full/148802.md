The word "overvariations" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It seems to be a newly coined or very rarely used word, possibly a blend or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is not possible.  To provide a helpful response, we need to understand the intended meaning.  Is it a possible misspelling of another word, or a deliberate creation?  If you can provide context or clarify the intended meaning, I can offer a more accurate analysis.
