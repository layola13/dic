phlogistication:/ˌflɒdʒɪˈsteɪʃən/| n. |燃素化；氧化|The process of adding phlogiston to a substance, according to the phlogiston theory.  This theory, now obsolete, proposed that combustible materials contained a substance called phlogiston, and that combustion was the release of this substance.  Phlogistication was therefore seen as the process by which a substance gained phlogiston, often accompanied by a change in properties. |Example: The calcination of a metal was considered a process of phlogistication, as the metal was thought to be gaining phlogiston.  金属的煅烧被认为是燃素化的过程，因为人们认为金属正在获得燃素。 |近义词:oxidation (in a historical, phlogiston-related context)|反义词:dephlogistication (in a historical, phlogiston-related context)|名词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The process phlogisticates the metal. = 这个过程使金属燃素化。
Phlogistication often involves a color change. = 燃素化过程通常会伴随颜色变化。


一般过去时:
The alchemist phlogisticated the substance. =炼金术士使物质燃素化。
Scientists believed phlogistication explained combustion. = 科学家认为燃素化解释了燃烧。


现在完成时:
They have phlogisticated several samples. = 他们已经使几个样品燃素化了。
The experiment has shown the effects of phlogistication. = 实验已经显示了燃素化的效果。


过去完成时:
They had phlogisticated the material before analysis. = 他们在分析之前已经使材料燃素化了。

The experiment will demonstrate phlogistication. = 实验将演示燃素化。


虚拟语气:
If we phlogisticated it, we might see a different result. = 如果我们使它燃素化，我们可能会看到不同的结果。
I wish I had understood phlogistication better. = 我希望我以前对燃素化有更好的理解。


被动语态:
The substance was phlogisticated in the furnace. = 该物质在炉中被燃素化了。
The metal was believed to be phlogisticated during the reaction. = 人们认为该金属在反应过程中被燃素化了。


疑问句:
Was the material phlogisticated properly? = 材料是否被正确地燃素化？
How does phlogistication affect the properties of the substance? = 燃素化如何影响物质的特性？


否定句:
The substance was not phlogisticated. = 该物质没有被燃素化。
The reaction did not result in phlogistication. = 该反应没有导致燃素化。
