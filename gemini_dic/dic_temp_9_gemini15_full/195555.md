词源:
The word "semipiousness" is a combination of "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partly") and "piousness" (meaning "the quality or state of being pious; devoutness").  Therefore, it literally means "half-piousness" or "partly pious."  The word reflects a condition where someone exhibits some aspects of piety but lacks genuine religious feeling.
