interstriation: /ˌɪntərˈstreɪʃən/ | n. | 条纹；细纹；层纹 | The microscopic alternating bands of different refractive indices in striated muscle fibers.  It refers to the detailed pattern of alternating light and dark bands within muscle fibers,  visible under a microscope.  This pattern is crucial for the muscle's contractile function. | Example: The interstriation of the muscle fibers was clearly visible under the high-powered microscope.  肌肉纤维的层纹在高倍显微镜下清晰可见。 | 近义词：striation, banding, layering | 反义词：homogeneity (lack of striations)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The interstriation of this muscle sample is very distinct. = 这个肌肉样本的条纹非常清晰。
We examine the interstriation patterns of different muscle types. = 我们检查不同肌肉类型的条纹图案。


一般过去时:
The researchers observed the interstriation under the microscope. = 研究人员在显微镜下观察了条纹。
The interstriation was less pronounced in the damaged tissue. = 在受损组织中，条纹不那么明显。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the interstriation for many years. = 科学家们已经研究条纹多年了。
We have not yet fully understood the function of the interstriation. = 我们尚未完全了解条纹的功能。


过去完成时:
They had already analyzed the interstriation before the presentation. = 他们在演示之前就已经分析了条纹。
The scientists had never seen such a peculiar interstriation pattern before. = 科学家们以前从未见过如此奇特的条纹图案。


将来时:
We will analyze the interstriation using advanced imaging techniques. = 我们将使用先进的成像技术来分析条纹。
Researchers will further investigate the relationship between interstriation and muscle function. = 研究人员将进一步研究条纹与肌肉功能之间的关系。


虚拟语气:
If the interstriation were different, the muscle function might be altered. = 如果条纹不同，肌肉功能可能会改变。
I wish we had better images of the interstriation. = 我希望我们有更好的条纹图像。


被动语态:
The interstriation was examined using electron microscopy. = 条纹是用电子显微镜检查的。
The interstriation pattern is being studied by several research groups. = 条纹图案正在被几个研究小组研究。


疑问句:
What causes variations in the interstriation of muscle fibers? = 什么导致肌肉纤维条纹的变化？
Is the interstriation visible with a light microscope? = 条纹可以用光学显微镜观察到吗？


否定句:
The interstriation was not clearly visible in this sample. = 在这个样本中，条纹不是很清晰。
There was no significant difference in the interstriation between the two groups. = 两组之间的条纹没有显著差异。


PHRASE->
muscle interstriation = 肌肉条纹
cardiac muscle interstriation = 心肌条纹
skeletal muscle interstriation = 骨骼肌条纹
cross-striation (synonym for interstriation in some contexts) = 横纹 (在某些情况下是条纹的同义词)
study of interstriation = 条纹研究
