词源:

The word "outdatedness" is derived from the adjective "outdated," which itself combines the prefix "out-" (meaning "beyond," "outside," or "no longer") with the past participle "dated."  "Dated" in this context means "belonging to a particular time; of a past time." Thus, "outdated" signifies something that is no longer current or relevant because it belongs to the past.  The suffix "-ness" is added to transform the adjective into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being outdated.


用法说明:

Outdatedness refers to the state or condition of being out of date, obsolete, or no longer relevant or fashionable. It implies that something is old-fashioned, superseded by newer developments, or no longer in keeping with current standards or trends.  This applies to various things, including technology, ideas, fashions, practices, and information.
