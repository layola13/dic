The word is a combination of:

* **pre-**:  A prefix meaning "before" or "prior to."
* **annexed**: The past participle of the verb "to annex," meaning "to incorporate (territory) into an existing political unit, such as a country or state."  "Annex" itself comes from the Latin "annectere," meaning "to bind to," "to fasten," or "to connect."
