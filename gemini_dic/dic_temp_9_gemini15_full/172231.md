词源:
The word "pushiness" derives from the verb "push," which has Old English roots ("pusan").  The suffix "-iness" indicates a state or quality, transforming "push" (the act of pushing) into "pushiness" (the quality of being pushy).  The evolution reflects the intensification of the meaning from simply pushing to aggressively pushing, often to the detriment of others.
