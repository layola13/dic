词源:
The word "powwow" comes from the Algonquian languages of Native Americans, specifically from the Narragansett word *pow wow*, meaning "medicine man" or "shaman."  Over time, the meaning shifted to refer to the meetings and ceremonies these spiritual leaders held.  The term's usage then broadened to include any gathering or consultation.
