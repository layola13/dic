词源:

The phrase "in charge" originates from the Old English word "charge," meaning "to entrust" or "to burden." Over time, "charge" evolved to also mean "responsibility" or "care."  The preposition "in" signifies being within or under the scope of that responsibility.  Therefore, "in charge" literally means "within the burden or responsibility of."
