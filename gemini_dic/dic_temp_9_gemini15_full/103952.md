**Word Origin:**

* **judicial:**  Derived from the Latin word "iudex," meaning "judge."  The word evolved through Old French "judicial" to its modern English form.  It signifies relating to or characteristic of a judge, court, or law.

* **-nesses:** A suffix added to adjectives to form nouns denoting multiple qualities or states.


**Usage:**
