semitontine:/ˌsemiˈtɒntaɪn/| n.| 半年金 | A semitontine is a type of life insurance policy where the policyholders share in the profits of the insurance company, but the profits are paid out only after a certain period of time, typically six months.  It's a hybrid between a tontine and a regular life insurance policy.  The term is now largely obsolete. | Example:  While not common today,  historical records mention semitontine policies offered by certain insurance companies.  | 近义词: tontine (but with shorter payout period) | 反义词:  None directly, as it's a specific type of insurance.
