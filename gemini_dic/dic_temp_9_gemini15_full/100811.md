词源:

The word "intrinsic" comes from the Latin word "intrinsecus," meaning "from within."  "Intrinsic" entered English in the 16th century.


用法说明：

1.  **形容词用法**:  "Intrinsic" is primarily used as an adjective to describe qualities or properties that are inherent or essential to something.  It is often used to contrast with "extrinsic," which describes qualities that are external or added on.


2.  **搭配**: "Intrinsic value," "intrinsic motivation," "intrinsic properties," "intrinsic quality" are common phrases.


3.  **与其他词的比较**: While "inherent," "innate," and "essential" are close synonyms, "intrinsic" often emphasizes a deeper, more fundamental aspect of something's nature.  "Inherent" suggests something is inseparable from something else, "innate" suggests something is present from birth, and "essential" means something is necessary.


注意："intrinsic" 通常不与人直接搭配使用，而是用来形容人的品质或特征。例如，我们说“他具有内在的善良”（His intrinsic goodness），而不是“他内在的”。
