The word "fenan" is not a word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please double-check the spelling.
2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name (person, place, or thing) or a brand name.
3. **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.
4. **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word or slang term not yet recognized in dictionaries.

To provide the analysis you requested, I need the correct spelling or more context about where you encountered this word.
