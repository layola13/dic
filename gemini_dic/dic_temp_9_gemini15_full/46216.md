cysticerce:/ˌsɪstɪˈsɜːrsiː/| n. |囊尾蚴|A larval stage of a tapeworm, especially of the genus *Taenia*, that develops in the tissues of an intermediate host (such as a pig or cow) and which, if ingested by a human, can develop into an adult tapeworm.  It's characterized by a fluid-filled sac containing the larval head (scolex) of the tapeworm. |例句：The patient's symptoms were consistent with cysticercosis, a parasitic infection caused by the presence of cysticerci in the brain. 患者的症状与囊虫病一致，这是一种由脑内囊尾蚴引起的寄生虫感染。


例句：Ingestion of undercooked pork containing cysticerci can lead to human cysticercosis. 食用含有囊尾蚴的未煮熟的猪肉会导致人类囊虫病。


近义词：tapeworm larva, larval cestode |反义词：adult tapeworm
