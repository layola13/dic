mistakenness's: /mɪˈsteɪkənəsɪz/ | n. | 错误的性质；错误的例子（复数） | The mistakenness's of his actions led to the project's failure.  |  errors, faults, blunders | correctness, accuracy |  名词


This word is not a standard word in English.  "Mistakenness" is a noun meaning the state or quality of being mistaken; an instance of being mistaken. Adding "'s" makes it a plural possessive, indicating multiple instances of mistakenness belonging to something or someone.  It's grammatically correct but stylistically awkward.  It would be better to rewrite the sentence to avoid this construction.  For example, instead of "The mistakenness's of his actions...", one might say "His actions were full of mistakes" or "His many mistakes led to...".



There is no standard usage section for a non-standard word like "mistakenness's".  The usage would be identical to that of the noun "mistakenness"  but with the added possessive plural inflection.  Examples would be constructed similarly to the example above, but are not worthwhile to create as the word itself should be avoided.
