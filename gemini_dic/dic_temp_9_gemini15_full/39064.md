conformer:/kənˈfɔːrmər/| n. |构象异构体，构象体|A conformer is a specific spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule that can be interconverted by rotation about single bonds.  Conformers are not distinct molecules; they are different conformations of the same molecule.  They differ in energy and can be distinguished by spectroscopic methods. |Example: Cyclohexane exists in several conformers, including the chair and boat conformations.  环己烷存在几种构象异构体，包括椅式和船式构象。


The different conformers of a molecule are often in equilibrium with each other. The relative populations of the various conformers depend on the energy differences between them.  Higher energy conformers are less populated than lower energy conformers.  不同构象的分子通常彼此处于平衡状态。各种构象异构体的相对数量取决于它们之间的能量差异。高能构象异构体的数量少于低能构象异构体。


Example: Different conformations of butane have different energies; the anti-conformation is more stable than the gauche-conformation. 丁烷的不同构象具有不同的能量；反式构象比邻位构象更稳定。|isomer, rotamer|anti-conformer
