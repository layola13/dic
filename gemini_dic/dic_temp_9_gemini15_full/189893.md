词源:
The word "samosa" ultimately derives from the Persian word "sanbosag,"  which itself might have origins in the ancient Sanskrit word "sanbhogā," meaning “something to be enjoyed.”  Over time, the word evolved through various languages (including Arabic and Hindi) before entering English.  The variations in spelling and pronunciation reflect its journey across different cultures and regions.
