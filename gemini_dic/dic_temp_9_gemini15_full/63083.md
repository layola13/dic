词源:
The word "ensconce" comes from the Old French "esconser," meaning "to hide," "to shelter," or "to conceal."  The prefix "en-" indicates "in" or "into," and the root is related to the Old Norse word "skjul," meaning "shelter" or "hiding place."  The evolution reflects a shift from a primarily secretive placement to a more comfortable and secure one.
