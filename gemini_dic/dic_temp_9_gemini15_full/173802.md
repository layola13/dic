Word Origin:

The word is a combination of "quasi" (from Latin, meaning "as if," "seemingly," or "apparently") and "pleasurably" (from "pleasure," ultimately from Old French *plesir, from Latin *placere, "to please").  Therefore, "quasi-pleasurably" literally means "as if pleasurably," indicating a resemblance to pleasure without fully achieving it.
