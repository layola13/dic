词源:

The word "finishing" comes from the Old English word "fyndan," meaning "to find" or "to discover."  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the act of bringing something to its final state or completion.  The "-ing" suffix indicates a gerund or present participle, signifying the ongoing action or process.
