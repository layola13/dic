词源:
The word "slapstick" originates from the actual prop used in early forms of physical comedy.  A slapstick was a long, flat piece of wood with a hinged paddle at the end.  When two actors hit each other with it, it would make a loud "slap" sound, hence the name.  The term evolved to encompass the style of comedy itself.
