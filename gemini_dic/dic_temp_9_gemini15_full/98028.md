由于inordinateness本身就是一个相对少见的词，其复数形式inordinatenesses更少见，因此无法提供具体的语法例句，例如一般现在时、过去时等等的例句。  大部分语法结构都可以套用在单数形式inordinateness上，然后将例句中的主语改为复数即可。  例如，"The inordinateness of his behavior was shocking." 可以改为 "The inordinatenesses of their behaviors were shocking."


PHRASE->

由于inordinatenesses是一个罕见的词，因此没有常见的词组搭配。


词源:

From "inordinate" + "-nesses" (plural suffix).  "Inordinate" itself derives from "in-" (not) + "ordinate" (ordered, regular, or properly arranged).  Therefore, "inordinateness" literally means "not being orderly or properly arranged," implying excess or lack of moderation.
