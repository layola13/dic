* **postmistress:**  This combines "post" (relating to mail and postal services) and "mistress" (historically, a woman in charge).
* **ship:** This suffix denotes a state, condition, office, or rank.


Therefore, "postmistressship" literally means the "state or condition of being a postmistress," or the office held by a postmistress.
