词源:
The phrase "lay hands on" originates from Old English.  "Lay" comes from the Old English verb *lecgan*, meaning "to put, place, or lay."  "Hands" is the plural of the Old English word *hand*, and "on" is a preposition retaining its original meaning.  The phrase's meaning developed over time from a literal physical act of placing hands on something to the figurative sense of obtaining or acquiring something.
