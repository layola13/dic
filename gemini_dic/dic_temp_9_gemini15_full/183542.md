词源:

The word "reputation" comes from the Old French word "reputacion," which in turn derived from the Latin word "reputatio."  "Reputatio" is formed from the verb "reputare," meaning "to think over again, to consider, to reckon, to esteem."  This indicates the process of people forming and reconsidering their opinions of someone or something over time, leading to their overall reputation.
