WORD ORIGIN->
The word "justified" comes from the Latin word "iustificare," which means "to declare righteous" or "to make right."  The prefix "jus" relates to law and justice, while "facere" means "to make" or "to do."  Therefore, the root meaning points to the act of making something right or legally sound.
