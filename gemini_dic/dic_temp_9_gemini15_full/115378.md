词源:
The word "manscape" is a blend of "man" and "landscape."  It emerged in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as male grooming practices became more common and discussed openly.  The "landscape" part refers to the shaping or altering of the body hair, similar to how one might landscape a garden.
