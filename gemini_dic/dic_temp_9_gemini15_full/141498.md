opisthoglypha:/ɒpɪsˈθɒɡlɪfə/| n. |后沟牙类毒蛇| Opisthoglyphous snakes are snakes with grooved or hollow rear fangs.  These fangs are located in the back of the mouth, rather than the front like in front-fanged venomous snakes.  They inject venom by chewing on their prey, allowing the venom to flow into the wound. Many opisthoglyphous snakes are mildly venomous, posing little threat to humans unless provoked or handled improperly.  However, some species can deliver painful bites. |Example:  Many colubrid snakes are opisthoglyphous, possessing rear fangs that deliver venom. 许多游蛇科蛇类是后沟牙类毒蛇，拥有后沟牙来注射毒液。|近义词:rear-fanged snake, back-fanged snake|反义词:proteroglyphous (前沟牙类), solenoglyphous (管牙类)|名词

词源:
The word "opisthoglypha" is derived from Greek:
* opistho- (ὀπίσθο-) meaning "behind" or "rear"
* glypha (γλύφη) meaning "carving" or "groove"

Therefore, "opisthoglypha" literally means "rear-grooved," referring to the location of the fangs in the snake's mouth.
