The word "downam" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps "down," "downward," or a compound word incorporating "down"?  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **A neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, a regional dialect word, or slang used within a specific community.  If this is the case, providing context (where you encountered the word) would be helpful.

3. **A proper noun:** It could be a place name or a person's name.
