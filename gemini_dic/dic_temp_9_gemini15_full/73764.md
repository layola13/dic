词源:

The word "formal" comes from the Old French word "formal," meaning "of or pertaining to form," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "forma," meaning "form, shape, figure."  The English word evolved to encompass the sense of adherence to established rules and conventions, hence its association with formality and proper behavior.
