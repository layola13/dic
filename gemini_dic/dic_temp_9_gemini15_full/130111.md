词源:

The word "non-purposive" is a compound word formed from:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of".  It derives from Old French *non*,  from Latin *non*.

* **purposive**: An adjective meaning "having a purpose or intention".  It's derived from "purpose" + "-ive" (a suffix forming adjectives). "Purpose" itself comes from Old French *purpos*, ultimately from Latin *propositum*, a past participle meaning "something placed before," implying a goal or intention.
