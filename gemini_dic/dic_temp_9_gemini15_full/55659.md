ditolyl: /ˈdaɪˌtaʊlɪl/ | n. | 二甲苯基 |  A ditolyl is a biaryl compound consisting of two tolyl groups (methylbenzenes) linked together.  The connection between the tolyl groups can occur at various positions on the benzene rings, leading to different isomers.  This makes ditolyl a general term rather than a specific chemical compound.  It's used primarily in the context of organic chemistry and material science. |  The synthesis of ditolyl involves coupling reactions of tolyl halides or boronic acids.  Different catalysts and reaction conditions can be employed to control the regioselectivity of the coupling, yielding various isomers. | 近义词: bi-tolyl,  dimethylbiphenyl | 反义词: N/A
