neuronally:/nʊˈrɒnəli/| adj. |神经元的；神经的；神经性地|Relating to or affecting neurons.  The study focused on neuronally mediated responses.| The effects of the drug were neuronally based.  药物的影响是基于神经的。|近义词：nervously (in some contexts), neurologically|反义词：  None directly opposite, but could be considered antonymous to terms suggesting non-neural processes.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The signal travels neuronally across the synapse. = 信号通过突触以神经方式传递。
This process is neuronally controlled. = 这个过程是由神经控制的。


一般过去时:
The information was neuronally processed. = 信息以神经方式被处理。
The response was neuronally mediated. = 反应是由神经介导的。


现在完成时:
The research has shown neuronally significant findings. = 研究已经显示了神经上重要的发现。
Scientists have explored neuronally driven behaviors. = 科学家们已经探索了神经驱动的行为。


过去完成时:
The pathway had already been neuronally established. = 这条通路已经被神经系统建立。
The neurons had previously responded neuronally. = 神经元先前已经以神经方式做出反应。


将来时:
The effects will be neuronally analyzed. = 影响将被神经学分析。
The data will be interpreted neuronally. = 数据将被神经学解释。


虚拟语气:
If the connection were neuronally intact, the signal would transmit. = 如果连接是神经完整的，信号就会传递。
It is crucial that the pathways remain neuronally functional. = 至关重要的是，通路保持神经功能。


被动语态:
The response was neuronally triggered. = 反应是由神经触发的。
The results were neuronally interpreted. = 结果被神经学解释。


疑问句:
Is the response neuronally based? = 反应是神经基础的吗？
Are these effects purely neuronally mediated? = 这些影响纯粹是由神经介导的吗？


否定句:
The impairment was not purely neuronally based. = 受损并非纯粹基于神经。
The signal was not neuronally transmitted. = 信号没有通过神经传递。

PHRASE->
