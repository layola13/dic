naphthene:/ˈnæfθiːn/| n. |环烷烃；环烷；萘烷|A saturated hydrocarbon with a closed ring of carbon atoms.  Naphthenes are also known as cycloalkanes. They are found in petroleum and are important components of gasoline and other fuels.|Example:  The crude oil contained a significant percentage of naphthenes.|近义词：cycloalkane|反义词：alkene (unsaturated hydrocarbon)
