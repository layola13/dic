The word "semi-feral" is a combination of:

* **semi-**:  A prefix meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."  Derived from Latin *semi*.

* **feral**:  An adjective meaning "existing in a wild state, especially after escaping domestication."  It ultimately derives from the Latin word *ferus*, meaning "wild," "savage," or "fierce."
