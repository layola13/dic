词源:

The word is a combination of "half," meaning "partially" or "to an incomplete extent," and "informingly," an adverbial form of "inform," meaning "to communicate information."  The "-ingly" suffix transforms the adjective "informative" into an adverb, describing the *manner* of informing.  The combination creates a new word to describe a specific manner of communication.
