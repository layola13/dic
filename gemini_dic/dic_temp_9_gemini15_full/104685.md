kary:/ˈkæri/| n. |细胞核；核心|The combining form of the Greek word karyon, meaning "kernel" or "nut," referring to the nucleus of a cell.  It is used in scientific terminology to denote the nucleus or a nuclear component.|例句：Eukaryotic cells contain a membrane-bound karyon. 真核细胞包含一个有膜结合的细胞核。|近义词：nucleus, core|反义词：N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The karyon houses the cell's genetic material. = 细胞核容纳细胞的遗传物质。
This karyotype analysis shows a normal karyon structure. = 此核型分析显示正常的细胞核结构。


一般过去时:
Scientists studied the karyon's structure under a microscope. = 科学家们在显微镜下研究了细胞核的结构。
The damaged karyon led to cell death. = 受损的细胞核导致细胞死亡。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several proteins within the karyon. = 研究人员已经确定了细胞核内的几种蛋白质。
We have observed changes in the karyon during cell division. = 我们观察到细胞分裂过程中细胞核的变化。


过去完成时:
Before the cell divided, the karyon had replicated its DNA. = 在细胞分裂之前，细胞核已经复制了它的DNA。
The scientists had already examined the karyon's composition before publishing their findings. = 科学家们在发表研究结果之前就已经检查了细胞核的成分。


将来时:
Scientists will further investigate the karyon's function in disease. = 科学家们将进一步研究细胞核在疾病中的作用。
We will analyze the karyon's morphology using advanced imaging techniques. = 我们将使用先进的成像技术分析细胞核的形态。


虚拟语气:
If the karyon were damaged, the cell would likely die. = 如果细胞核受损，细胞很可能会死亡。
It is essential that the karyon maintain its integrity. = 细胞核保持完整性至关重要。


被动语态:
The karyon's structure was studied extensively. = 细胞核的结构被广泛研究。
The karyon's function is being investigated by many researchers. = 许多研究人员正在研究细胞核的功能。


疑问句:
What is the function of the karyon in this cell type? = 在这种细胞类型中，细胞核的功能是什么？
How does the karyon contribute to cell division? = 细胞核如何促进细胞分裂？


否定句:
The cell did not have a normal karyon. = 该细胞没有正常的细胞核。
The karyon was not damaged in this experiment. = 在这个实验中，细胞核没有受损。


PHRASE->
karyon membrane = 细胞核膜
karyon division = 核分裂
karyon structure = 细胞核结构
karyon envelope = 核膜
karyon matrix = 核基质
