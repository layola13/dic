词源:

The word "melancholia" originates from the Greek words "melas" (μέλας), meaning "black," and "chole" (χολή), meaning "bile."  Ancient Greek physicians believed that an imbalance of the four humors (blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile) caused illnesses, and melancholia was attributed to an excess of black bile.  The term evolved through Latin ("melancholia") before entering English.


用法说明:

Melancholia can be used to describe:

1. **A mild feeling of sadness:** This is often associated with a pensive or reflective mood, sometimes even with a sense of beauty or nostalgia.  For example, "a melancholic autumn afternoon."

2. **A severe mental disorder:**  In modern clinical usage, melancholia is often considered a subtype of major depressive disorder, characterized by specific symptoms like loss of interest or pleasure, significant weight loss or gain, and psychomotor retardation or agitation.  This usage requires careful context and often professional diagnosis.

2.  His melancholia was so profound that he could barely leave his bed. 他的忧郁如此深重，以至于他几乎无法下床。
