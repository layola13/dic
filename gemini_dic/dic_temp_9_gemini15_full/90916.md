The word "hurac" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word.
* **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name (person, place, or thing) or a brand name not widely known.
* **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into English.
* **It's a neologism:**  It could be a newly coined word not yet in common usage.

If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer more assistance.
