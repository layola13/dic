This involves measuring the same quantity with different instruments or methods and then adjusting the results so that they agree. | Example:  Intercalibration of the different weather stations is crucial for accurate climate modeling.  交互校准不同的气象站对于精确的气候建模至关重要。


Example: The laboratory underwent a rigorous intercalibration process to ensure the accuracy of its results.  实验室进行了严格的交互校准过程，以确保其结果的准确性。


Near synonyms: cross-calibration, mutual calibration, comparative calibration


Antonyms:  There isn't a direct antonym, but the opposite concept would be a lack of calibration or inconsistent measurements.


Word Origin:  The word is a combination of "inter-" (meaning between or among), "calibration" (the act of checking and adjusting the accuracy of a measuring instrument).  Calibration itself comes from the Latin word "calibrare," meaning "to gauge" or "to adjust."
