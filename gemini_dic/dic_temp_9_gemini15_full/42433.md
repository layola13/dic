countercurrent:/ˈkaʊntərkʌrənt/| adj.|逆流的，反向的|Relating to or denoting a process or system in which two currents flow in opposite directions, often to maximize transfer of heat or other substances between them.  For example, in the nephron of the kidney, blood flows in one direction while filtrate flows in the opposite direction, allowing for efficient reabsorption of water and other molecules.|例句：The highly efficient heat exchange in the fish's gills is due to the countercurrent flow of blood and water.|近义词：opposite, contrary|反义词：concurrent, co-current


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The blood flows countercurrent to the water. =血液与水流向相反。
This system utilizes a countercurrent exchange. =这个系统利用逆流交换。


一般过去时:
The experiment demonstrated countercurrent flow. =实验证明了逆流。
They observed a countercurrent pattern in the data. =他们在数据中观察到逆流模式。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified many examples of countercurrent systems. =科学家们已经发现了许多逆流系统的例子。
Researchers have studied countercurrent exchange in various organisms. =研究人员研究了各种生物体中的逆流交换。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the mechanism was not understood. =在发现之前，人们不了解这种机制。
They had already observed similar countercurrent phenomena. =他们之前已经观察到类似的逆流现象。


将来时:
We will investigate further the countercurrent mechanism. =我们将进一步研究逆流机制。
This research will explore countercurrent flow in marine animals. =这项研究将探索海洋动物中的逆流。


虚拟语气:
If the flow were concurrent, efficiency would be much lower. =如果水流是并流的，效率就会低得多。
I wish I had better understood countercurrent exchange earlier. =我希望我早点理解逆流交换。


被动语态:
Countercurrent exchange is utilized by many organisms for efficient heat transfer. =许多生物利用逆流交换来进行有效的热传递。
The principle of countercurrent flow has been extensively studied. =逆流原理已被广泛研究。


疑问句:
Is this a countercurrent or concurrent system? =这是逆流系统还是并流系统？
Does countercurrent exchange enhance efficiency? =逆流交换是否提高了效率？


否定句:
The system does not exhibit countercurrent flow. =该系统没有表现出逆流。
This process is not a typical example of countercurrent exchange. =这个过程不是逆流交换的典型例子。


PHRASE->
countercurrent exchanger=逆流交换器
countercurrent multiplication=逆流倍增
countercurrent flow=逆流
countercurrent system=逆流系统
countercurrent mechanism=逆流机制
