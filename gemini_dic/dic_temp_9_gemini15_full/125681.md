The word "mundaneness" is derived from the adjective "mundane," which ultimately originates from the Latin word "mundanus," meaning "worldly" or "belonging to the world."  This reflects the association of mundaneness with the ordinary and commonplace aspects of earthly existence, as opposed to the spiritual or extraordinary.
