ignitibility:/ˌɪɡˌnɪtəˈbɪləti/| n. | 可燃性，易燃性 | The ability or tendency of a substance to ignite or catch fire easily.  It refers to how readily a material will start burning when exposed to an ignition source.  The higher the ignitability, the greater the risk of fire. | Example: The high ignitability of gasoline makes it a dangerous substance to handle carelessly. 高度的汽油可燃性使其成为一种处理不当的危险物质。 The ignitability of dry leaves contributes to the spread of wildfires. 干树叶的可燃性助长了野火的蔓延。|近义词：flammability, combustibility | 反义词：non-flammability, incombustibility | 名词
