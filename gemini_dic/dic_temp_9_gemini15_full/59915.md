The word "edental" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  To help, I need more context where you encountered this word.  Was it in a scientific paper, a fictional work, or somewhere else? Knowing the context might help determine its intended meaning or reveal the correct spelling of a similar word.
