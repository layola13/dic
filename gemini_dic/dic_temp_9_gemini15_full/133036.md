由于 "nonenviablenesses" 是 "nonenviable" 的复数形式，其词源和用法与 "nonenviable" 密切相关。


词源:

* **enviable:**  This word originates from the adjective "envy," meaning a feeling of discontent and resentment aroused by someone else's possessions, qualities, or luck.  The suffix "-able" transforms the verb into an adjective, signifying something that can be envied.

* **non-enviable:** The prefix "non-" negates the meaning of "enviable," resulting in "not enviable" or "undesirable."

* **nonenviablenesses:** The suffix "-ness" turns the adjective "nonenviable" into a noun, referring to the state or quality of being nonenviable. The addition of "-es" forms the plural, indicating multiple instances of such undesirable situations.

用法说明：

"Nonenviablenesses" is used to describe a collection or accumulation of unfortunate or unpleasant circumstances. It highlights the quantity and weight of negative experiences rather than focusing on a single, isolated instance.  It's a relatively formal word and less frequently used than its singular counterpart.  The context usually demands a description of multiple, interconnected hardships or disadvantages.


由于该词是复数名词，其语法用法与一般复数名词相同，不会有特殊时态变化。


例句：


1.  The numerous nonenviablenesses of her childhood shaped her adult personality. 她童年时期诸多令人不快的经历塑造了她成年后的性格。
