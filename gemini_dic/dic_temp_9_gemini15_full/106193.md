The word "knockstone" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word, or a proper noun (like a place name).  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible without more context.  To provide the requested information, I need additional information about where you encountered this word.


If you can provide the context where you found "knockstone," I can attempt a more informed analysis. For example, tell me:

* **The source:** Where did you see this word (book, website, conversation)?
* **The surrounding text:**  What words are around "knockstone"? This will help determine its meaning and possible etymology.


Without this information, I can only offer speculative possibilities.  It might be a combination of "knock" (to strike) and "stone" (a rock), potentially referring to:

* A type of stone used for knocking (e.g., a type of hammer stone).
* A stone that makes a knocking sound when struck.
* A place name incorporating "knock" (meaning hill) and "stone."


Once you provide context, I can give a more accurate and detailed response.
