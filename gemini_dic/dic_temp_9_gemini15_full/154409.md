词源:

The word "permissibility" derives from the verb "permit," ultimately from the Latin word "permittere," which means "to allow," "to grant," or "to suffer."  The suffix "-ibility" is a common noun-forming suffix indicating capacity or capability.  Therefore, "permissibility" literally means "the state of being permitted."
