词源:  The word is a combination of "quasi-" (meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent") and "automatically" (meaning "in a way that is self-acting or self-regulating").  "Quasi-" derives from Latin *quasi, meaning "as if" or "like."  "Automatically" originates from "automatic," ultimately from Greek  αὐτόματος (automatos), meaning "self-acting."
