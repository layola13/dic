nonnattilyness:/ˌnɒnˈnætɪlinəs/| n. |不讲究; 不时髦; 不优雅|The word "nonnattilyness" is not a standard English word. It is likely a neologism formed by adding the prefix "non-" to "nattily," meaning "in a natty manner," and then adding "-ness" to create a noun.  Therefore, it describes a lack of natty qualities.  It suggests a state of being unstylish, unrefined, or lacking elegance.  Because it's not a standard word, there are no established dictionary definitions or common usage examples.|例句：The nonnattilyness of his attire was quite noticeable. 他穿着打扮的不讲究非常引人注目。  The room's overall nonnattilyness was a disappointment. 房间整体的不雅致令人失望。|近义词：sloppiness, shabbiness, untidiness, inelegance|反义词：nattilyness, elegance, stylishness, sophistication|名词
