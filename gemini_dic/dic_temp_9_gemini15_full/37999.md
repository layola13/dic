词源:
The word "compliment" originates from the French word "compliment," which in turn comes from the Italian word "complimento."  These words ultimately derive from the Latin word "complere," meaning "to fill up" or "to complete."  The sense of "complementing" something, making it whole or perfect, evolved into the meaning of expressing praise that makes someone feel complete or valued.
