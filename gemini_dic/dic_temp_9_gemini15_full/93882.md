词源：

The word "immomentous" is formed from the prefix "im-" (meaning "not") and the word "momentous," which means "of great importance."  Therefore, "immomentous" literally means "not momentous."  The root word "moment" derives from Latin "momentum," meaning "movement,"  "weight," or "importance."  The shift in meaning to "importance" is a semantic evolution.


用法说明：

Immomentous is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that lacks significance or importance. It is often used in a formal or literary context.  It's less common than synonyms like "insignificant" or "trivial" in everyday conversation.
