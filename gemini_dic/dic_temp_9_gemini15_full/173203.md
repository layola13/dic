quasi-charitable: /ˈkwɑːzaɪ ˈtʃærɪtəbl/ | adj. | 准慈善的；似慈善的 |

英文解析:  Describing an organization or activity that resembles a charitable one in some aspects but doesn't fully meet the criteria for being officially classified as a charity. This might involve a lack of formal charitable status, a less than completely altruistic motive, or a focus on a narrower range of beneficiaries than a typical charity.
