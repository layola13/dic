词源:
The word "draftiness" is derived from the adjective "drafty," which itself comes from the noun "draft," meaning a current of air.  The suffix "-iness" indicates a state or quality.  The ultimate origin lies in the Old Norse word "draugr," meaning "ghost" or "specter"— referring to the chilling effect of drafts.
