go-aheadative: /ˌɡoʊ əˈhɛdədɪv/| adj. |批准的；获准的；可以继续的|  This word is not a standard English word. It appears to be a non-standard or invented combination of "go-ahead" (noun/adjective) and "-ative" (suffix).  There is no established meaning or usage in dictionaries or common language.  The intended meaning likely derives from the meaning of "go-ahead," which implies permission or approval to proceed.  Therefore, "go-aheadative" might be intended to mean "having received approval" or "permitted to proceed." However, its use should be avoided as it's not recognized as a legitimate word.|Example: (Hypothetical, as the word isn't standard)  The go-aheadative project finally began after months of delays.  (This sentence would be better written as: "The approved project finally began after months of delays.")|近义词:approved, authorized, sanctioned, permitted|反义词:prohibited, forbidden, disallowed, vetoed|adj.
