词源:
The word "endenize" is derived from the earlier word "denizen," meaning an inhabitant or resident, especially a foreigner who has been granted certain rights.  The "-ize" suffix indicates the process of making something or someone into a denizen, hence the meaning of "to make accustomed to" or "naturalize."  The word's history reflects the historical process of granting citizenship or residency rights to foreigners.
