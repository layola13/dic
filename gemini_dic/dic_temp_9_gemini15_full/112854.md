The word "lucking" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested is not possible.  It's likely a misspelling, a newly coined word, or a word from a very specific dialect or context.  If you could provide more context (e.g., a sentence where you encountered this word), it may be possible to offer a better interpretation or suggestion for a similar-sounding or related word.
