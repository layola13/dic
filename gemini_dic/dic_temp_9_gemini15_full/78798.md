词源:
From Middle English *gilt, past participle of gildan "to gild, to pay, to compensate", from Old English gyldan, from Proto-Germanic *geldaną, from Proto-Indo-European *(g)h₂eld- "to pay, to compensate".  The meaning shifted from "to pay" to "to cover with gold" due to the common practice of paying in gold.
