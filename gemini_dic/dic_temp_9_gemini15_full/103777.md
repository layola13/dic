词源:
The word "journey" comes from the Old French word "jornee," meaning "day's journey."  It ultimately derives from the Latin word "diurnata," which also means "day's journey."  The concept reflects the limitations of travel in earlier times, where distance covered was often measured by the amount of time spent traveling in a single day.
