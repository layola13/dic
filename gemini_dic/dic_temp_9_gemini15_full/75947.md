词源:

The word "funhouse" is a compound word formed from "fun" and "house".  "Fun" ultimately derives from Old English *fun, meaning "fraud, deception, trickery,"  while its modern meaning of "enjoyment, amusement" developed later. "House" is a straightforward word with Germanic origins referring to a building for dwelling.  The combination creates a word describing a building specifically designed for fun and amusement, exploiting illusions and playful distortions.
