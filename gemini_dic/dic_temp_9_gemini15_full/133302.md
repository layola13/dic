nonexpiries: /ˌnɒnɪkˈspaɪəriːz/ | n. | 不到期物，永不过期物 |  Items or contracts that do not have an expiration date.

The term "nonexpiries" is a relatively recent addition to the lexicon, formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the noun "expiries" (plural of "expiry," meaning the end of a period of validity).  Its etymology traces back to the Latin word "expirare," meaning "to breathe out," "to expire," or "to end." The "non-" prefix is of Greek origin.


There are no direct synonyms for "nonexpiries," as the term is quite specific. However, depending on the context, you might use phrases like "perpetual items," "lifetime offerings," "items with indefinite validity," or "everlasting subscriptions."  There are also no true antonyms, as the opposite would simply be items with an expiration date.  The antonym would be described by a phrase, such as "items with expiration dates."
