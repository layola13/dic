词源:

The word derives from "raffish," which itself comes from "raff," a now-obsolete slang term for a disreputable person or a group of such people.  "Raff" has roots possibly in the Dutch word "raf," meaning "rough" or "coarse."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "raffish" into a noun, signifying the quality or state of being raffish.
