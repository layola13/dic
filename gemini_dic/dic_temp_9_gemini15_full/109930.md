词源:

The word "libelous" derives from the Old French word "libel," meaning "a written accusation," which in turn comes from the Latin word "libellus," a diminutive of "liber," meaning "book" or "scroll."  The original sense referred to a written defamation, as opposed to "slander," which referred to spoken defamation.

It implies an intentional or reckless disregard for the truth, leading to harm.  The action of creating or publishing libelous material is called libel.
