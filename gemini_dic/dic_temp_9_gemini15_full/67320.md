词源:

The word "extemporarily" derives from the Latin word "extempore," meaning "out of time" or "on the spot."  The prefix "ex-" means "out of" or "from," and "tempore" refers to "time."  Thus, the word's root indicates something done without prior planning or preparation, at the moment. The adverbial suffix "-ly" is added to create the adverbial form.


用法说明:

Extemporarily is used to describe actions or speeches that are done without prior planning or preparation.  It emphasizes the spontaneous and unplanned nature of the event.  It is often used to describe speeches, performances, or decisions made on the spur of the moment.  The word carries a connotation of improvisation and lack of rehearsal.
