词源:
The word "salamandrid" comes from the genus name *Salamandra*,  which itself originates from the Latin *salamandra*, likely borrowed from Greek σαλαμάνδρα (salamándra). The exact etymology of the Greek word is uncertain, with suggestions linking it to Persian words related to fire or the mythical fire salamander.  The suffix "-id" is a common zoological suffix indicating membership in a family.
