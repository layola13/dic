词源:

The word "non-sober" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" and the adjective "sober."

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not," "opposite of," or "without."  It's derived from Old French *non* and ultimately from Latin *non*.

* **sober**:  Meaning "not drunk," "serious," or "moderate." Its origins trace back to Old French *sobre*, from Latin *sobrius*, meaning "temperate," "self-controlled."


用法说明:

"Non-sober" is primarily used as an adjective to describe someone who is intoxicated by alcohol or other substances.  It's a more formal and less common alternative to words like "drunk" or "intoxicated."  It emphasizes the absence of sobriety rather than focusing on the degree or type of intoxication.  While "drunk" often implies a visible and significant level of intoxication, "non-sober" can encompass a wider range, including mild impairment.


The word is not frequently used in everyday conversation, appearing more often in formal or legal contexts where precise language is required.  For instance, it might be used in police reports or medical records.
