词源:

Maddening derives from the verb "to madden," meaning "to drive mad" or "to make insane."  The suffix "-ing" transforms the verb into a present participle, functioning as an adjective.  The ultimate root traces back to Old English *maden, which itself has uncertain origins, possibly related to words expressing frenzy or wildness.
