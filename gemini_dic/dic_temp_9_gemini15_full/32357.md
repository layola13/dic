词源:
The word "childly" is derived from the Old English word "cild," meaning "child," with the addition of the suffix "-ly," which forms adjectives.  Therefore, it literally means "like a child."  The evolution reflects a straightforward semantic progression from the root word representing a person to the adjective describing qualities associated with that person.
