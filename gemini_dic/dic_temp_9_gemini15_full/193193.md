sedimenting: /ˈsɛdəmɛntɪŋ/ | v. | 沉淀；沉降 | The process of sediments settling out of a fluid.  |例句：The river is sedimenting rapidly, reducing the depth of the channel.  这条河正在迅速沉淀，导致河道变浅。

例句：Fine particles are sedimenting slowly in the still water. 静水中细小的颗粒正在缓慢沉淀。


近义词：settling, depositing, precipitating | 反义词：floating, rising


词源:  From "sediment" + "-ing" (present participle suffix). "Sediment" ultimately derives from Latin *sedimentum, from sedere "to sit".


USAGE->

一般过去时:
The sedimenting process took several hours. = 沉淀过程花费了几个小时。
The water sedimented quickly after the storm. = 暴风雨过后，水很快沉淀下来。

现在完成时:
The sediment has already sedimented to the bottom. = 沉淀物已经沉淀到底部了。

被动语态:
The sample was sedimented by centrifugation. = 样品通过离心沉淀。
The sediment is being sedimented in a controlled environment. = 沉淀物正在受控环境中沉淀。

疑问句:
Is the solution sedimenting properly? = 溶液沉淀是否正常？
How long will it take for the sediment to sediment? = 沉淀物需要多长时间才能沉淀？

否定句:
The mixture is not sedimenting effectively. = 混合物没有有效地沉淀。
The particles did not sediment completely. = 颗粒没有完全沉淀。
