词源:

The word "enlightenedness" derives from the adjective "enlightened," which itself originates from the verb "enlighten."  "Enlighten" comes from the Old English "onlihtan,"  a combination of "on-" (on, upon) and "lihtan" (to shine, to lighten).  Thus, the core meaning reflects the idea of shining light upon something, thereby illuminating it. The metaphorical extension to intellectual and moral illumination occurred over time.
