The word "hobbly" is not a standard English word. There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is not possible.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:** Perhaps the intended word was "hobbling," "hobby," or another similar-sounding word.
* **A regional dialect word:** It might be used informally in a specific region or community.
* **A newly coined word:**  It's possible it's a very recent invention or a neologism.
* **A proper noun:** It might be a name or place name.


To provide the requested information, I need clarification on the intended word or more context about where you encountered "hobbly."
