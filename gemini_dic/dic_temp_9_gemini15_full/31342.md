The word "characterism" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no accepted pronunciation, definition, or usage. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a complete analysis following your requested format.  To help you, I can offer possibilities if you can provide more context on where you encountered this word.  Was it in a specific book, article, or conversation?  Knowing the context might allow me to guess at the intended meaning and provide a similar word that *does* exist.
