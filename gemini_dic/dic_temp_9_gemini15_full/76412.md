词源:
The word "gag" ultimately derives from the Old French word "gager," meaning "to pledge," "to wager," or "to give a pledge."  Its use to mean "to choke" or "to stifle" evolved from the idea of something being forcefully stopped or restrained, like a pledge being held.  The sense of preventing speech developed later.
