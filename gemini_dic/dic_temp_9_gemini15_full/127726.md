词源:

The word "negligibilities" derives from the adjective "negligible," which comes from the verb "neglect"  (to disregard or ignore).  The suffix "-ible" transforms "neglect" into an adjective meaning "capable of being neglected," and the further suffix "-ity" creates the noun form "negligibility," meaning "the state or quality of being negligible." Finally, the addition of "-ies" creates the plural form "negligibilities."  Therefore, the word's core meaning is rooted in the act of ignoring or disregarding something due to its insignificance.
