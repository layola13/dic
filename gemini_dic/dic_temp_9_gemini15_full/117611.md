megaphyll:/ˈmɛɡəfɪl/| n. |大型叶|A megaphyll is a type of leaf found in most vascular plants, characterized by a complex arrangement of veins and a flattened blade.  It develops from a primordium that originates from multiple cells, unlike microphylls which develop from a single cell. Megaphylls are considered to have evolved from branching stem systems.  They are the dominant leaf type in most seed plants and ferns.|例句：The large, broad leaves of oak trees are examples of megaphylls.|近义词：macrophyll|反义词：microphyll
