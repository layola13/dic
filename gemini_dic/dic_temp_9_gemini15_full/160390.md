The word "poplared" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a full etymological analysis, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  It's likely a misspelling, a newly coined word, or a word from a very niche dialect or specialized field.

If you could provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more informed guess about its intended meaning or possible origin.
