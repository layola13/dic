The word "geusdism" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or recognized linguistic databases.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information for it.  It is likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a term specific to a very niche field, or a word from a constructed language.

If you could provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer some assistance in determining its meaning or origin.
