preexecutor:/ˌpriːˈɛksɪkjuːtər/ | n. | 预执行器 | A preexecutor is a component in a system, often a software system, that performs tasks or operations before the main executor or process takes over.  It's used to prepare the environment, initialize resources, or perform preliminary actions to optimize the main execution.  This can involve tasks like loading data, setting up configurations, or pre-processing inputs. | Example: The preexecutor loaded the necessary libraries and data sets before the main application started running.  预执行器在主应用程序开始运行之前加载了必要的库和数据集。 | 近义词：preprocessor, initializer | 反义词：postprocessor


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The preexecutor prepares the data. = 预执行器准备数据。
The system uses a preexecutor to optimize performance. = 系统使用预执行器来优化性能。

一般过去时:
The preexecutor initialized the database. = 预执行器初始化了数据库。
The program's preexecutor completed its tasks successfully. = 程序的预执行器成功完成了它的任务。

现在完成时:
The preexecutor has already loaded the required modules. = 预执行器已经加载了所需的模块。
The system has utilized a preexecutor for improved efficiency. = 系统已经使用了预执行器来提高效率。

过去完成时:
The main process began after the preexecutor had finished its work. = 预执行器完成工作后，主进程才开始。
The application crashed because the preexecutor hadn't completed its tasks. = 应用程序崩溃是因为预执行器没有完成它的任务。

将来时:
The preexecutor will handle the initial setup. = 预执行器将处理初始设置。
The next version will include a more sophisticated preexecutor. = 下一个版本将包含一个更复杂的预执行器。

虚拟语气:
If the preexecutor failed, the main program would not run. = 如果预执行器失败，主程序将无法运行。
It is essential that the preexecutor completes its tasks before the main process. = 预执行器必须在主进程之前完成其任务。

被动语态:
The data was prepared by the preexecutor. = 数据由预执行器准备。
The resources were initialized by the preexecutor before the main execution. = 资源在主执行之前由预执行器初始化。

疑问句:
Does the system use a preexecutor? = 系统使用预执行器吗？
What tasks does the preexecutor perform? = 预执行器执行什么任务？

否定句:
The preexecutor did not complete its tasks on time. = 预执行器没有按时完成其任务。
The system does not employ a preexecutor. = 系统不使用预执行器。


PHRASE->
preexecutor module 预执行器模块
preexecutor process 预执行器进程
preexecutor thread 预执行器线程
preexecutor configuration 预执行器配置
