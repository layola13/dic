词源:

The word "nontragical" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "tragical" (derived from "tragedy").  "Tragedy" itself originates from the Greek word "tragoidia," which literally translates to "goat song," referring to ancient Greek dramatic performances involving a goat sacrifice.  The evolution of the meaning to encompass suffering and disaster is a result of the themes commonly explored in these plays.
