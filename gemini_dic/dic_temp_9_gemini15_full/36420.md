The word "cokiest" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a particular dialect or community.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.

To help, we need more context. Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the source might help determine its intended meaning and allow for a closer approximation of its analysis.  

If you can provide more information, I can try to offer a possible interpretation and analysis based on likely intended spellings or similar-sounding words.
