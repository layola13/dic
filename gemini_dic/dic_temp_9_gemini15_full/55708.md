The word "dius" does not exist in standard English.  There is no pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage to provide.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a word from another language, or a neologism (newly coined word).  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I may be able to offer more help.
