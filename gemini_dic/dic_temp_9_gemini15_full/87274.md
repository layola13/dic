词源:
The word "hermaphroditic" derives from Hermaphroditus, a figure in Greek mythology. Hermaphroditus was the son of Hermes (the messenger god) and Aphrodite (the goddess of love).  He was famously united with a nymph named Salmacis, resulting in a being with both male and female characteristics.  This mythological association gave rise to the biological term.
