gradability:/ˌɡrædəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可分级性，等级性 | The property of being able to be graded or ranked along a scale.  Gradability refers to the capacity of a word or concept to exist in varying degrees or intensities. For example, adjectives like "hot" or "tall" are gradable because they can be modified by adverbs like "very" or "extremely" and compared using comparative and superlative forms (hotter, hottest; taller, tallest).  This contrasts with non-gradable adjectives, such as "dead" or "pregnant," which cannot be intensified or compared in the same way. |  The gradability of temperature allows us to say something is "slightly warm," "moderately warm," or "very warm." |近义词：scalability, ranking |反义词：non-gradability
