pixelations:/ˌpɪksəˈleɪʃənz/ | n. | 像素化，马赛克化 | The process of converting an image into a mosaic of pixels, often resulting in a loss of detail and a blocky appearance.  It can be intentional (e.g., for artistic effect or to obscure sensitive information) or unintentional (e.g., due to low resolution or image compression). | The photo showed significant pixelations due to the low resolution.  这照片由于分辨率低而出现了明显的像素化。  The website blurred the faces in the photos with pixelations for privacy reasons.  为了保护隐私，该网站用像素化模糊了照片中的面孔。 | pixelization,  blockiness | clarity, sharpness | 名词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The image shows pixelations. = 这张图片显示了像素化。
Pixelations reduce image quality. = 像素化降低了图像质量。

一般过去时:
The old photo suffered from severe pixelations. = 那张旧照片严重像素化了。
The video displayed noticeable pixelations after compression. = 压缩后视频显示出明显的像素化。

现在完成时:
The software has reduced pixelations in the image. = 该软件已减少了图像中的像素化。
They have applied pixelations to protect identities. = 他们应用了像素化来保护身份。

过去完成时:
The image had already suffered pixelations before editing. = 图片在编辑之前就已经像素化了。
We had noticed the pixelations in the video before uploading it. = 我们在上传视频之前就已经注意到像素化了。


将来时:
The new camera will minimize pixelations. = 新相机将最大限度地减少像素化。
Increased compression will likely cause more pixelations. = 增加压缩可能会导致更多像素化。


虚拟语气:
If the resolution were higher, there would be fewer pixelations. = 如果分辨率更高，像素化就会更少。
I wish the image didn't have so many pixelations. = 我希望图像没有那么多像素化。


被动语态:
The image was affected by pixelations. = 图像受到了像素化的影响。
Pixelations are often caused by compression. = 像素化通常是由压缩引起的。


疑问句:
Are there any pixelations in this video? = 这个视频有像素化吗？
Do you see any pixelations in the image? = 你在图片中看到任何像素化了吗？


否定句:
The image does not show significant pixelations. = 这张图片没有显示明显的像素化。
The video doesn't have any noticeable pixelations. = 这个视频没有任何明显的像素化。


PHRASE->

reduce pixelations = 减少像素化
level of pixelations = 像素化程度
avoid pixelations = 避免像素化
digital pixelations = 数字像素化
causes of pixelations = 像素化的原因
