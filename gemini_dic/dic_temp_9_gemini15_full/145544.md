The word "overcommonly" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It appears to be a nonce word, meaning a word coined for a specific occasion and not in general use.  It seems to be formed by combining "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great extent) with "commonly" (meaning frequently or usually).  Therefore, a possible interpretation would be "excessively commonly" or "more commonly than usual," implying something is unusually frequent.


However, because it's not a real word, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  To illustrate the format, let's analyze a similar, existing word: "commonly".
