The word "re-parks" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a newly coined word or a misspelling.  To analyze it, we need to break it down based on its likely components:

**Analysis based on "re-" and "parks":**

* **re-**:  /riː/ | prefix | 再，重新 |  Indicates repetition or reversal of an action.
* **parks**: /pɑːrks/ | v. (present tense of park) | 停车 | To place (a vehicle) in a parking space or area.


Therefore, "re-parks" would most likely mean to **park again** or **park repeatedly**.  It could also imply the act of **re-parking a vehicle**, perhaps after initially parking in an unsuitable spot or having to move due to time restrictions.


Since it's not a standard word, we cannot provide formal grammatical analysis like the example you provided.  However, we can illustrate its potential usage in sentences:

**Example Sentences:**

He re-parks his car closer to the entrance.  = 他把车重新停在了离入口更近的地方。

She re-parks the car every two hours to avoid parking fines. = 她每两小时就重新停车一次，以免被罚款。

The valet re-parks the cars after the event. = 泊车员在活动结束后重新停放车辆。



**Near Synonyms (depending on context):**

* Reparks (if we consider it as a noun) could be similar to "reparking" or "second parking."
*  The verb action could be described using phrases like "parks again," "moves and parks," or "relocates and parks."


**Antonyms:**

There isn't a direct antonym, as the opposite would depend on the context.  For example, if "re-parks" means moving a car to a new spot, the opposite would be leaving it in the original spot.  If it refers to repeated parking, the opposite would be parking only once.


**Note:**  The lack of formal recognition of "re-parks" highlights the importance of using established vocabulary in writing and communication. While understanding the meaning from context is possible, employing clearer and more conventional phrasing is always preferable.
