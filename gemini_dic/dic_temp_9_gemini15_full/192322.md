词源:
The word "scribble" comes from the Middle English word "scriblen," which in turn is believed to be of imitative origin, reflecting the sound of scratching or writing quickly and carelessly.  The meaning has remained fairly consistent throughout its history, referring to hasty and often illegible writing.
