词源：
The word "furnishings" is derived from the verb "furnish," meaning "to provide or equip with furniture or other necessary items."  "Furnish" ultimately traces back to the Old French word "fournir," which means "to supply, provide."  The "-ing" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, indicating the things that are furnished.
