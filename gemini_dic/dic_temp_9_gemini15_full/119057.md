metoche:/ˈmɛtəki/| n. |换喻；转喻；比喻；修辞手法|A figure of speech in which a word or phrase is applied to something it does not literally denote in order to suggest a resemblance. It's a type of metaphor where the meaning is transferred from one concept to another based on association or contiguity.  |Example: "The pen is mightier than the sword." (Here, "pen" represents writing and "sword" represents military force.) |近义词：metaphor, allegory, simile |反义词：literal meaning


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in literary analysis and discussions of rhetoric.  There isn't a typical conjugation like verbs or common usage in everyday conversation.  Therefore, providing examples across tenses and moods is not applicable. Instead, here are examples showing the application of the concept of *metoche* in different contexts:


Example 1 (Literary Analysis):
"Shakespeare frequently employs metoche, as seen in Hamlet's 'To be or not to be,' where 'to be' represents life and 'not to be' represents death." =莎士比亚经常使用换喻，例如在哈姆雷特的“生存还是毁灭”中，“生存”代表生命，“毁灭”代表死亡。


Example 2 (Rhetorical Analysis):
"The advertisement uses metoche to associate the product with feelings of success and happiness." = 这则广告运用换喻将产品与成功和快乐联系起来。


Example 3 (Illustrative Sentence):
"The phrase 'the crown' used to represent the monarchy is a classic example of metoche." = 用“王冠”来代表君主制是换喻的一个经典例子。


Example 4 (Comparative Sentence):
"Unlike a simile, which uses 'like' or 'as', metoche relies on implied comparison." = 与使用“像”或“作为”的明喻不同，换喻依赖于隐含的比较。


PHRASE->
Because "metoche" is a specific rhetorical term,  phrase examples are less relevant than examples showcasing its application within phrases or sentences.  The focus should be on analyzing how metoche is used within specific expressions.  For example:  the analysis of a sentence or passage would showcase *metoche* in action rather than specific phrases paired with the word.
