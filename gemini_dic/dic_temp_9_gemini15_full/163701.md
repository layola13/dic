USAGE->
This word is primarily used in linguistics and logic, not in everyday conversation.  Therefore, providing examples across various tenses and moods is not applicable in the same way as with common verbs.  Instead, here are examples illustrating its usage in different contexts:


In simple sentences:

The predicate describes the subject: The dog barked loudly. (The predicate "barked loudly" describes the subject "The dog.")  狗大声吠叫。（谓语“大声吠叫”描述了主语“狗”。）

The predicate is complex: The old woman, tired from her journey, sat down heavily. (The predicate is "was tired from her journey, sat down heavily").  疲惫不堪的老妇人重重地坐了下来。（谓语是“因旅途劳累，重重地坐了下来”。）


In compound sentences:

The predicate connects independent clauses: The sun rose, and the birds began to sing. ("rose" and "began to sing" are predicates of their respective clauses). 太阳升起了，鸟儿开始唱歌。（“升起”和“开始唱歌”分别是各自从句的谓语。）


In complex sentences:

The predicate modifies the verb: The students, having completed their homework, left for home.  ("having completed their homework" modifies the predicate "left for home"). 学生们完成了作业后就回家了。（“完成了作业”修饰了谓语“回家了”。）
