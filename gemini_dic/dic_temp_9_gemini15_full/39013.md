词源:  From the Late Latin *confiscatio, from confiscare "to seize," from com- "together" + fiscus "treasury."  The ultimate origin is from the Proto-Italic *fīscum, which is of uncertain origin, possibly related to a word meaning "basket." The sense evolved from "putting something into the treasury" to "seizing for the treasury."
