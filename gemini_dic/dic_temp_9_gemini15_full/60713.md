词源:

* **electro-**:  From Greek *elektron*, meaning "amber," referring to static electricity.  This prefix indicates a connection to electricity.
* **oculogram**: From *ocul-*, combining form of Latin *oculus*, meaning "eye," and *-gram*, from Greek *-gramma*, meaning "something written or drawn," hence a recording or image.

Therefore,  electro-oculogram literally means a "recording of the electrical activity of the eye."
