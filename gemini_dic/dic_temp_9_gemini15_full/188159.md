routing:/ˈraʊtɪŋ/| n.| 路由，路径规划 |The process of selecting a path for transferring data from a source to a destination.| 例句：The network routing protocol determined the best path for the data packet. 网络路由协议确定了数据包的最佳路径。


例句：Efficient routing is crucial for optimal network performance.  高效的路由对于最佳网络性能至关重要。


近义词：pathfinding, directing | 反义词：None  | 词性：名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The router performs routing constantly. = 路由器持续执行路由。
Network routing determines the best path. = 网络路由确定最佳路径。


一般过去时:
The system used a different routing algorithm yesterday. = 系统昨天使用了不同的路由算法。
The routing process took longer than expected. = 路由过程比预期时间长。


现在完成时:
We have implemented a new routing protocol. = 我们已经实施了一个新的路由协议。
The network has optimized its routing for faster transmission. = 网络已经优化了其路由以实现更快的传输。


过去完成时:
The data had already been routed before the error occurred. = 错误发生之前数据已经被路由。
The system had failed because of incorrect routing configurations. = 系统由于错误的路由配置而失败。


将来时:
The new software will improve routing efficiency. = 新软件将提高路由效率。
The company will implement a more advanced routing system next year. = 公司明年将实施一个更先进的路由系统。


虚拟语气:
If we had better routing, we would have fewer network issues. = 如果我们有更好的路由，我们将会有更少的网络问题。
I wish the routing were more efficient. = 我希望路由更有效率。


被动语态:
The data packets are routed by the router. = 数据包由路由器路由。
The routing tables are updated regularly. = 路由表定期更新。


疑问句:
How is the routing configured? = 路由是如何配置的？
What routing protocol are you using? = 你正在使用什么路由协议？


否定句:
The data wasn't routed correctly. = 数据没有正确路由。
The network doesn't support dynamic routing. = 网络不支持动态路由。



PHRASE->
routing table = 路由表
dynamic routing = 动态路由
static routing = 静态路由
routing protocol = 路由协议
optimal routing = 最佳路由


词源:  The word "routing" comes from the verb "route," meaning to send or direct along a particular course.  The suffix "-ing" transforms the verb into a gerund, functioning as a noun.  The ultimate origin traces back to Old French *route ("road, way").
