morphonomy:/mɔːrˈfɒnəmi/| n. |形态音位学|The study of the relationship between the sound structure (phonology) and the morphological structure (morphology) of words.  It examines how the pronunciation of a morpheme (the smallest unit of meaning) changes depending on its position within a word or phrase. For example, how the pronunciation of a plural suffix changes depending on the preceding sound. |Example: The study of morphonomy helps explain why the plural of "cat" is "cats" (/kæts/) while the plural of "dog" is "dogs" (/dɒɡz/), reflecting different phonological rules affecting the pronunciation of the plural morpheme "-s".|近义词:morphophonology|反义词:N/A
