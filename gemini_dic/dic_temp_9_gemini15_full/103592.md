The word "joinant" is not a word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries or word databases.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
2. **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word, a term used within a specific community, or slang not yet widely recognized.
3. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name or place name.


Please provide the correct spelling or more context, and I will be happy to help you with the analysis.
