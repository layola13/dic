词源:  The word "cusser" is derived from the verb "to cuss," meaning "to curse" or "to swear."  This verb has roots in Middle English "cussen,"  itself likely related to Old English "cyssan" (to kiss),  but evolving to signify a more forceful and often offensive expression.  The semantic shift likely reflects the expressive and sometimes aggressive nature of cursing.
