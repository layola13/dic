词源：
The word "overnormality" is a relatively recent coinage, formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessive" or "beyond") with "normality" (the state or quality of being normal).  It doesn't have a long historical etymology like many established words.  Its creation reflects a need to describe a specific phenomenon – an excessive level of normalcy that is itself unusual.
