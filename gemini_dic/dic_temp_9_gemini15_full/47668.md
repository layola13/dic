词源:
The verb "debrief" emerged in the mid-20th century, primarily within military and intelligence contexts. It's a back-formation from the noun "debriefing," which itself is a combination of the prefix "de-" (meaning "remove" or "reverse") and the noun "briefing" (the act of giving information).  The original meaning involved reversing or undoing the effects of a briefing, by questioning someone about their experiences to gather information or assess their performance after a mission or operation.
