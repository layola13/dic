词源:
The word "mosey" is of uncertain origin.  While its exact etymology is debated, it's believed to be an Americanism, likely emerging in the late 19th or early 20th century.  Some theories suggest it might be a blend of words or a sound-imitative term reflecting the slow, meandering movement it describes.  There's no definitive, traceable root word.
