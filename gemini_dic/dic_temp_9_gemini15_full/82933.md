词源:
The word "gumption" is of uncertain origin, but it is likely derived from the obsolete word "gump," meaning "to be in good spirits" or to be "cheerful."  The addition of the suffix "-tion" transformed it into a noun referring to the quality or state of having "gump."  Over time, the meaning shifted to emphasize practical intelligence and initiative.
