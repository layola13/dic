词源：

The word "indomitable" comes from the Old French word "indomptable," which itself is derived from the Latin prefix "in-" (not) + "domitabilis" (tamable, conquerable).  The root "domitare" means "to tame" or "to subdue." Therefore, "indomitable" literally means "not tamable" or "unconquerable."
