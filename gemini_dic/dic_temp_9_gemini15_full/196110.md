septarium:/sɛpˈteəriəm/| n. | septaria;  结核;  泥灰岩结核 | A septarium is a concretion, typically found in sedimentary rocks, that has a characteristic cracked or fractured interior. These cracks are often filled with a different mineral than the surrounding rock, creating a striking visual effect. Septaria are formed through a process of dehydration and contraction of the sediment, leading to the development of cracks.  The filling of these cracks with minerals, often calcite, can happen over time through groundwater circulation.  They are often collected for their aesthetic appeal and can range in size from centimeters to meters. | Example: The geologist identified the unusual rock formation as a septarium due to its distinctive cracked interior and mineral infillings. |近义词: concretion, nodule |反义词:  (无明确反义词，可考虑与其形成过程相反的词语，例如unconsolidated sediment) |名词
