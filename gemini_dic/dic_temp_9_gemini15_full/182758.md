repartitioner:/ˌriːpɑːrˈtɪʃənər/| n. |重新分区器，再划分器 |A repartitioner is a component or algorithm in data processing systems that redistributes data across multiple nodes or partitions.  It's often used in distributed systems to improve performance, balance workload, or handle data skew.  |Example: The Spark application used a custom repartitioner to optimize data locality for faster processing.  Spark应用使用自定义的重新分区器来优化数据局部性以加快处理速度。|近义词：data shuffler, data distributor |反义词：data aggregator (in some contexts)


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the context of computer science and data processing.  Therefore, standard verb conjugations don't directly apply.  The usage revolves around how a repartitioner is *used* within a system or algorithm.

Example 1 (describing its function):  The repartitioner evenly distributed the data across the cluster nodes.  重新分区器将数据均匀地分布在集群节点上。

Example 2 (describing its effect): After repartitioning, the query execution time was significantly reduced.  重新分区后，查询执行时间大大缩短。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly involving "repartitioner". The term is highly technical.  Instead, related phrases focusing on data distribution and processing would be relevant:

* data redistribution strategy: 数据重新分配策略
* parallel processing with repartitioning: 带重新分区的并行处理
* optimized repartitioning scheme: 优化的重新分区方案
* repartitioning for improved performance: 为了提高性能而进行的重新分区
* custom repartitioner implementation: 自定义重新分区器实现
