The word "{christ-jesuses}" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a made-up combination of "Christ" and "Jesus."  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis as requested is not possible.  I can, however, provide information on the individual words "Christ" and "Jesus."


**Christ:**

/kraɪst/ | n. | 基督 | The anointed one; a title for Jesus, considered by Christians to be the Messiah prophesied in the Old Testament.  It derives from the Greek word "Χριστός" (Christos), meaning "anointed one," which is a translation of the Hebrew word "מָשִׁיחַ" (Mashiach), meaning "anointed one."  The term refers to the one chosen by God to be king or leader.

*Example:* Christians celebrate the birth of Christ at Christmas.  基督徒在圣诞节庆祝基督的诞生。


**Jesus:**

/ˈdʒiːzəs/ | n. | 耶稣 | The central figure of Christianity, believed by Christians to be the Son of God, the Messiah.  The name comes from the Greek form of the Hebrew name "יֵשׁוּעַ" (Yeshua), meaning "Yahweh is salvation" or "salvation of Yahweh."

*Example:*  Many people believe in the teachings of Jesus.  许多人相信耶稣的教诲。


Since "{christ-jesuses}" is not a valid word,  I cannot provide usage examples, near synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  The combination might be used informally or in a specific context (e.g., a creative writing piece), but it lacks standard dictionary definition and usage.
