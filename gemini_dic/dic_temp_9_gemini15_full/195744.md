词源:
The word "Semitism" comes from the term "Semite," referring to a member of the Semitic peoples, a group of related ethnic groups speaking Semitic languages, including Hebrew and Arabic.  The term originally had a purely linguistic and anthropological meaning, but in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was increasingly used in a pejorative sense to refer specifically to Jews, leading to the development of the term "anti-Semitism" to describe prejudice against Jews.  Therefore, the term "Semitism" itself, while not inherently negative, has become strongly associated with the negative connotations of anti-Semitism.
