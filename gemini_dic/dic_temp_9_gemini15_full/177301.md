reassortment:/ˌriːəˈsɔːrtmənt/| n. |基因重排，基因重组|The process by which genetic material is rearranged, typically in viruses, resulting in new combinations of genes.  This often occurs when two or more viruses infect the same cell and exchange genetic material.  The resulting virus may have different characteristics than the original viruses.|Influenza viruses undergo reassortment frequently, leading to the emergence of new strains. 流感病毒经常发生基因重排，导致新毒株的出现。


The reassortment of genes in the influenza virus is a major concern for public health. 基因在流感病毒中的重排是公共卫生领域的一个主要担忧。|genetic recombination, genetic shuffling|genetic stability


USAGE->
