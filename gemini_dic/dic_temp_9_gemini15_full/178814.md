recursively:/rɪˈkɜːrsɪvli/ | adv. | 递归地，反复地 |  In a recursive manner; repeatedly applying a procedure or function to its own output.  | Example: The program recursively calls itself until it reaches the base case.  这个程序递归地调用自身，直到达到基本情况。 | iteratively, repeatedly | non-recursively | 副词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The function recursively checks each element. =  函数递归地检查每个元素。
He recursively solves the problem. = 他递归地解决这个问题。


一般过去时:
The program recursively processed the data. = 程序递归地处理了数据。
She recursively searched the directory. = 她递归地搜索了目录。


现在完成时:
The algorithm has recursively sorted the list. = 算法已经递归地排序了列表。
We have recursively defined the function. = 我们已经递归地定义了函数。


过去完成时:
The system had recursively calculated the result before the error occurred. = 系统在错误发生之前已经递归地计算出了结果。
They had recursively searched the database unsuccessfully. = 他们已经递归地搜索了数据库，但没有成功。


将来时:
The software will recursively update the database. = 软件将递归地更新数据库。
He will recursively call the subroutine. = 他将递归地调用子程序。


虚拟语气:
If the function were recursive, it would be more efficient. = 如果函数是递归的，它会更有效率。
I wish the solution were recursively defined. = 我希望解决方案是递归定义的。


被动语态:
The data was recursively processed by the program. = 数据被程序递归地处理了。
The problem is being recursively solved by the algorithm. = 问题正在被算法递归地解决。


疑问句:
Does the function call itself recursively? = 函数是否递归地调用自身？
Is this problem solvable recursively? = 这个问题是否可以通过递归来解决？


否定句:
The program does not recursively traverse the tree. = 程序不会递归地遍历树。
The algorithm doesn't recursively partition the data. = 算法不会递归地划分数据。


PHRASE->
recursively defined function = 递归定义的函数
recursively enumerable set = 递归可枚举集
recursively solvable problem = 递归可解问题
recursively called procedure = 递归调用的过程
recursively partitioned data = 递归划分的数
