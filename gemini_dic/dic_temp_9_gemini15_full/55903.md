词源:

The word "divorcing" comes from the verb "divorce," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "divorcier," meaning "to separate" or "to divide."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "divortium," which also means "separation" or "division."  The suffix "-ing" indicates the present participle, showing an ongoing action.
