protoplanet:/ˈproʊtoʊˌplænɪt/| n. |原行星|A protoplanet is a large body of matter that forms within a protoplanetary disk and is thought to have the potential to become a planet.  It is a large mass of matter that has not yet fully formed into a planet, but is on its way.  It accretes matter from its surroundings through gravity, growing larger over time. |Example:  The protoplanet gradually accreted more material, growing larger and more massive.  原行星逐渐吸积更多物质，变得越来越大，质量也越来越大。  |近义词：planetary embryo, planetesimal |反义词：planet (in its fully formed state)
