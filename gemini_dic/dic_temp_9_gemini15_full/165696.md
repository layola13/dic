词源:

The word "premortify" is a relatively modern coinage, formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") with the verb "mortify" (meaning "to cause someone to feel shame or humiliation," ultimately deriving from Latin *mortīficāre,  "to kill"). Therefore, "premortify" literally means "to mortify beforehand" or "to cause oneself to feel shame or humiliation in advance."
