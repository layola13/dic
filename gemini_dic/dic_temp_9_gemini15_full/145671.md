词源:

The word "overcontrols" is a compound word formed from the prefix "over-" and the noun "controls."

* **over-**:  This prefix indicates "too much," "excessively," or "beyond."  It is of Germanic origin.

* **controls**: This noun refers to the power to influence or direct people's behavior or the course of events.  Its roots are in the Old French word "contreroller," meaning "to check, verify."  Ultimately, this word derives from the Latin "contra" (against) and "rotulus" (roll, scroll), referring to the process of checking against a list or record.
