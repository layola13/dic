词源：

From parallel + -ism.  "Parallel" comes from the Late Latin *parallelus, from Greek παράλληλος (parállēlos), from παρά (pará) "beside" + ἀλλήλων (allēlōn) "one another". "-ism" is a suffix forming nouns that denote doctrines, principles, practices, or conditions.


用法说明:

Parallelism is primarily a grammatical and rhetorical device.  It refers to the grammatical or structural similarity between parts of a sentence or between sentences.  This similarity can involve various aspects, including:

* **Structure:**  Repeating the same grammatical structure (e.g., subject-verb-object) across multiple phrases or clauses.
* **Sound:** Using similar sounds or rhythms (e.g., alliteration, assonance) in parallel phrases.
* **Meaning:**  Expressing similar or related ideas in parallel structures.


Examples of parallelism in different contexts:

* **Simple Sentence:**  "She likes to read, to write, and to paint." (Verb + infinitive phrase)
* **Complex Sentence:** "Because it is raining, and because the roads are slippery, and because it is already late, I'm going to stay home." (Because + clause)
* **Literary Example:** "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness..." (Charles Dickens, *A Tale of Two Cities*)


Note that excessive or poorly executed parallelism can sound awkward or repetitive.  Effective parallelism enhances clarity, rhythm, and impact.
