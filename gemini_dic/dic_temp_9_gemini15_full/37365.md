Etymology:

The word "commensurability" is derived from the Latin word "commensurabilis," which is formed from the prefix "com-" (meaning "together" or "with"), "mensura" (meaning "measure"), and the suffix "-bilis" (meaning "able" or "capable"). Therefore, the original meaning points to the ability of two things to be measured together using a common unit.
