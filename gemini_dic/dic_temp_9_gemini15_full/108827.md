词源:
The word "leavenless" is derived from "leaven," meaning a substance (such as yeast) that causes dough to rise.  Adding the prefix "un-" (or in this case, the suffix "-less") negates the meaning, resulting in "leavenless," meaning "without leaven."  The word's origins trace back to Old English *lēfen, related to Old High German *leibīn "loaf."
