词源:  The word "heterochromous" comes from the Greek words "heteros" (ἕτερος), meaning "different" or "other," and "chroma" (χρῶμα), meaning "color."  The suffix "-ous" is an adjectival suffix indicating "full of" or "having the quality of." Therefore, heterochromous literally means "having different colors."
