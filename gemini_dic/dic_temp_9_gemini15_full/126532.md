词源:
The word "nabobical" is derived from "nabob," which itself originates from the Urdu word "nā'ib" (نائب), meaning "deputy" or "viceroy."  British colonial officials in India, particularly those who amassed great wealth, were often called "nabobs."  The suffix "-ical" transforms the noun "nabob" into an adjective, describing something related to or characteristic of a nabob.
