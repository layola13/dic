precompletenesses:/ˌpriːkəmˈpliːtnəsɪz/| n. |预备完整性；预先完整性|This word is not found in standard English dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, or a misspelling.  It's likely formed by combining "pre-" (before), "complete" (entire, finished), and "-nesses" (a suffix indicating a plural or abstract state).  Therefore, a potential meaning could be the state of being complete beforehand or the collection of things that are complete in advance. However, without context or established usage, its precise meaning remains unclear. |No example sentences available due to the word's lack of established usage.|No synonyms or antonyms available due to the word's lack of established usage.|n.
