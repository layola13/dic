USAGE->
This word is relatively uncommon and doesn't naturally lend itself to demonstrating grammatical tenses in typical sentences.  The word's usage focuses on its noun meaning, describing a state or quality.  Therefore, tenses are not applicable in the same way as with action verbs.

Example sentences illustrating different sentence structures:

Declarative: The speaker's noncircuitousnesses were appreciated by the audience. (说话者的直率受到了听众的欣赏。)

Interrogative: Were the noncircuitousnesses of the report a deliberate choice? (报告的直率是刻意为之吗？)

Exclamatory: What noncircuitousnesses! (多么直接！)


PHRASE->
Because "noncircuitousnesses" is a relatively rare word, common phrases using it are unlikely.  The concept of directness, however, can be expressed through various phrases:

Getting straight to the point:  直接了当
In plain terms:  简单地说
No beating around the bush:  不拐弯抹角
To be blunt:  直言不讳
Cut to the chase:  开门见山
