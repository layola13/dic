词源:

The word "fairytale" is a compound word.  "Fairy" comes from Old French *faerie, meaning "fairyland, enchantment," ultimately from Latin *fata, meaning "fate, destiny."  "Tale" comes from Old English talu, meaning "speech, story, account."  Therefore, "fairytale" literally means a story about fairies or a magical, enchanting story.
