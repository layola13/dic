词源:
The word "moneylender" is a compound word formed from "money" and "lender".  "Money" ultimately derives from the Latin word "moneta," a name for the Roman goddess Juno, whose temple was located near the Roman mint.  "Lender" derives from the Old English "lǣnan," meaning "to lend".  Therefore, "moneylender" literally means "one who lends money".
