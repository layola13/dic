heterophoric: /ˌhɛtərəˈfɔːrɪk/ | adj. |  异指的，指示其他事物的 | Relating to or denoting a linguistic expression (such as a pronoun) that refers to something other than its immediate antecedent.  It points to something that is not explicitly mentioned in the immediately preceding text.  |


例句：

The pronoun "he" in "John said he was tired" is heterophoric because it refers to John, not to a previously mentioned "he". =  "John said he was tired" 中的代词 "he" 是异指的，因为它指的是 John，而不是前面提到的某个 "he"。


The demonstrative "that" in "I saw a car; that was red" is heterophoric, referring to the car. = "I saw a car; that was red" 中的指示词 "that" 是异指的，指的是那辆车。
