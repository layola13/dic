词源:

The word "nontangibleness" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), the adjective "tangible" (meaning "perceptible to the touch; palpable; real or concrete"), and the suffix "-ness" (forming nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition).  Therefore, "nontangibleness" literally means "the state of not being tangible".  "Tangible" itself has Latin roots, deriving from "tangere" (to touch).
