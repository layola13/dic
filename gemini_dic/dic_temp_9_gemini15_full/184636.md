词源:
The word "restricted" comes from the verb "restrict," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "restrictus," the past participle of "restringere."  "Re-" is a prefix meaning "back" or "again," and "stringere" means "to bind" or "to draw tight."  Therefore, "restrict" originally meant "to bind back" or "to tighten."  The addition of "-ed" creates the adjective form "restricted."
