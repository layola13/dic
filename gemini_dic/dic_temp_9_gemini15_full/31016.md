词源:
The word "challenger" comes from the Old French word "chalengier," meaning "to accuse, challenge, or summon."  This, in turn, has roots in the Vulgar Latin word "calumniare," meaning "to accuse falsely."  The evolution reflects a shift in meaning from a primarily negative connotation (false accusation) to a more neutral or even positive one (a test of skill or ability).
