The word "hurrayed" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a non-standard variant.  It might be an attempt to represent a past tense form of a word related to "hurrah," but even then, the correct past tense would simply be "hurrahed".

Therefore, a detailed analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need a correctly spelled and recognized English word.
