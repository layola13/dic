词源:
The word "mongrel" ultimately derives from the Old French word "melé," meaning "mixed" or "mingled," which in turn has roots in the Latin word "misceo," also meaning "to mix."  The transition from "melé" to "mongrel" involved phonetic changes and semantic shifts over time, solidifying its association with dogs of mixed breed and, later, anything of mixed or inferior quality.
