nondeterminist:/ˌnɒn.dɪˈtɜː.mɪ.nɪst/| adj. |非确定性的；非决定论的 |  Relating to or characterized by nondeterminism; not determined by prior causes.  It often refers to systems or processes where the next state is not uniquely determined by the current state,  allowing for multiple possible outcomes. In computer science, it describes algorithms or systems where the execution path isn't fixed and can vary based on inputs or internal choices.  | Example:  The nondeterministic nature of the quantum system makes it difficult to predict its behavior precisely.  非量子系统的非确定性使得精确预测其行为变得困难。

The nondeterministic algorithm explores multiple paths simultaneously.  这个非确定性算法同时探索多条路径。|近义词：indeterministic, probabilistic, unpredictable |反义词：deterministic, predictable
