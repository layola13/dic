词源:

The word "obsceneness" is derived from the Middle English word "obscene," which itself comes from the Late Latin word "obscenus."  "Obscenus" is composed of the prefix "ob-" (meaning "against" or "in the way of") and "caena" (meaning "dinner" or "sacred rite").  The original meaning alluded to something that was "unfit for a sacred rite" or "inappropriate for public viewing."  Over time, the meaning evolved to its current understanding of morally offensive and indecent.
