词源:

The word "irresistibility" is derived from the adjective "irresistible," which itself comes from the verb "resist" (from the Latin *resistere, meaning "to stand against").  The prefix "ir-" indicates negation, meaning "not." Therefore, "irresistibility" literally means "the inability to be resisted."
