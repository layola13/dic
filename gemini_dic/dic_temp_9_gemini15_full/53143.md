词源:  From diplomat + -ical.  "Diplomat" ultimately derives from the Greek word  δίπλωμα (díplōma), meaning "folded paper," referring to official documents, and eventually evolved to refer to the people who work with these documents in the context of international relations.  The suffix "-ical" is a common adjective-forming suffix.
