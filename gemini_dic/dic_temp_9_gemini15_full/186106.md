rhabdolith:/ˈræbdəˌlɪθ/| n. | 莱姆结石；梭状结石 | A rhabdolith is a rod-shaped concretion, typically found in urinary or other biological systems.  They are composed of calcium phosphate and other minerals.  The exact formation process is not fully understood, but it's believed to involve a process of mineral precipitation around a central nucleus.  |  Example: The analysis revealed the presence of several rhabdoliths in the patient's kidney stones.  分析显示患者肾结石中存在几块莱姆结石。 | 近义词: concretion, calculus | 反义词:  (no direct antonym, but could consider terms implying absence of such formations, e.g., "smooth," "unobstructed")
