词源:
The word "nonsolid" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "solid."  It emerged in English as a straightforward negation of the word "solid," reflecting the natural development of antonyms in language.  The root of "solid" traces back to Latin "solidus," meaning "solid, firm, whole."
