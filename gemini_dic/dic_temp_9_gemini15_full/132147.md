The word "noncultures" does not exist as a standard English word.  It's a possible neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full breakdown in the requested format is impossible.  However, we can analyze what it *might* mean and how it could be used.

If it were intended to mean "cultures that are not..." then we could approach it as a compound word.  Let's analyze a potential meaning and usage based on that assumption:

**Potential Analysis of "Noncultures" (assuming it means "cultures that are not...")**

/ˈnɒnˌkʌltʃərz/ | n. |非主流文化;  非传统文化;  未被认可的文化 | Cultures that are not considered mainstream or traditional, perhaps marginalized or underground cultures.  This word would be used to describe groups with unique practices that differ significantly from dominant societal norms.  The specific meaning would depend entirely on the context. |

* **Example:** "The anthropologist studied the noncultures of the remote island, focusing on their unique rituals and beliefs." = 人类学家研究了偏远岛屿上的非主流文化，重点关注他们独特的仪式和信仰。


* **Near synonyms:**  subcultures, countercultures, marginal cultures, underground cultures, alternative cultures.

* **Antonyms:** mainstream cultures, dominant cultures, traditional cultures.


**Note:** Because "noncultures" is not a real word, providing grammatical tenses, passive voice examples, or common phrases is not meaningful.  Its usage would be entirely dependent on its definition within a specific context.  The provided example sentence attempts to illustrate a possible application.  If a specific intended meaning for "noncultures" were provided, a more precise analysis would be possible.
