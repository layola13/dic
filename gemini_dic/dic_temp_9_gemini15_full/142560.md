Etymology:

The word "ostentatiousnesses" is derived from the adjective "ostentatious," which originates from the Latin word "ostentare," meaning "to display," "to show off," or "to exhibit."  The suffix "-ous" transforms the verb into an adjective, and the suffix "-ness" converts the adjective into a noun, describing the quality of being ostentatious.  Finally, "-es" adds the plural suffix.

Usage:


The word "ostentatiousnesses" is relatively uncommon, as it's the plural form of a noun already denoting a collection of showy behaviors.  It's used to emphasize the multiplicity of ostentatious acts or displays.  While you could use it in a sentence, it often sounds more formal or even slightly archaic.  In most cases, simply using "ostentatiousness" or describing individual instances of ostentation would be more natural.

Example Sentences (beyond those already given):

The various ostentatiousnesses of the new CEO, from his extravagant office to his constant boasts, alienated many employees. 新任CEO的各种炫耀行为，从他奢华的办公室到他不断的吹嘘，疏远了许多员工。


His ostentatiousnesses weren't limited to material possessions; they extended to his inflated claims of accomplishments. 他的炫耀不仅仅局限于物质财富；还包括了他夸大的成就声明。


Note:  Because "ostentatiousnesses" is a plural noun, grammatical structures will follow standard plural noun usage.  There are no unique grammatical considerations beyond those for any plural noun.
