The word "poinder" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it in major resources like Merriam-Webster, Oxford English Dictionary, or Cambridge Dictionary.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Please double-check your spelling.  If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it might be possible to guess the intended word.

2. **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a very recently coined word, a regional dialect word, or slang not yet widely recognized.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name (of a person, place, or thing) rather than a common word.

4. **It's a technical term:**  It could be specific to a particular field (science, technology, etc.).

Without further information, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  Please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
