词源:
The word "flysheet" is a compound word.  "Fly" here refers to the act of distributing something quickly and widely, similar to how a bird flies.  "Sheet" refers to a single sheet of paper. Therefore, "flysheet" literally means a sheet of paper distributed quickly.  The etymology traces back to the individual words' Old English roots, with "fly" having roots in Old English "fleogan" and "sheet" derived from Old English "scēat."
