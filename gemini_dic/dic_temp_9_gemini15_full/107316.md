USAGE->

This word is primarily used as an adjective and doesn't have typical verb conjugations like "hello."  Therefore, standard verb tense examples are not applicable.  The word describes a *method* of administering medicine, not an action itself.

PHRASE->

There are no common phrases using "lambative."  The word itself is quite archaic and rarely used in modern English.
