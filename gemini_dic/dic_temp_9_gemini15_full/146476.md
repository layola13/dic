词源:
The word "overfunded" is a compound word formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the adjective "funded" (meaning "provided with money").  "Funded" itself derives from the verb "fund," ultimately from Old French "fondre" (to melt, cast, found), referring to the establishing or providing of capital or resources.
