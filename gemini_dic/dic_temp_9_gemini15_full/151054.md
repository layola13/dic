词源:

The word "paraphraser" is derived from the verb "paraphrase," which itself comes from the Greek words "para" (beside) and "phrasis" (phrase or speech).  Therefore, it literally means "to speak beside" or "to express in other words."  The "-er" suffix is added to create the noun form, indicating a person or thing that performs the action.
