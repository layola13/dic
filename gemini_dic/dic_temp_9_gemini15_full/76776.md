gametes:/ˈɡæmiːts/| n. |配子，生殖细胞|Gametes are reproductive cells that fuse during fertilization in organisms that reproduce sexually.  They are haploid, meaning they contain only one set of chromosomes.| Example:  Human sperm and egg cells are gametes. 人类的精子和卵细胞都是配子。


The fusion of two gametes (one from each parent) results in a zygote, which develops into a new organism. 两个配子（分别来自父母双方）的融合会产生一个受精卵，受精卵会发育成一个新的生物体。|近义词：germ cell, reproductive cell |反义词：zygote (in the context of fertilization)
