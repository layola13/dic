词源：
The word "skincare" is a compound word formed by combining "skin" and "care."  "Skin" comes from Old English *scinu, meaning "skin, hide," and "care" comes from Old English *caru, meaning "anxiety, sorrow, worry," but also evolved to mean "attention, concern."  The combination thus reflects the attention and concern given to the health and condition of the skin.
