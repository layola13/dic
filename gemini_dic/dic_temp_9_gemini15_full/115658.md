marechal: /ˈmɑːʃəl/ | n. | 元帅；陆军元帅；法警；（旧法）总督 |

英文解析：The word "marechal" derives from the Old French word "mareschal," meaning "marshal."  It originally referred to a high-ranking military officer, specifically a master of horse (the chief officer responsible for the horses and cavalry of a monarch or noble). Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass various high-ranking military positions, culminating in the modern understanding of a field marshal or chief marshal.  In some contexts, it can also refer to a court officer or bailiff.
