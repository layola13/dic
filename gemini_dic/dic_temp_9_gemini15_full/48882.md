词源:

* **de-**:  prefix meaning "away from," "reverse," or "completely."
* **fragment**: from Latin *fragmentum* "a piece broken off," from *frangere* "to break."
* **-ing**: present participle suffix.


Therefore, "defragmenting" means "breaking something into pieces and then putting it back together again," specifically in the context of computer data.
