reinnervation:/ˌriːɪnɜːrˈveɪʃən/| n. |神经再生；再神经支配|The process by which a nerve fiber or nerve cell regenerates and re-establishes its connection with its target tissue or organ.  This often happens after nerve damage or injury.  It's a crucial process for restoring function. |Example:  Successful reinnervation of the damaged muscle is essential for regaining movement.  成功的受损肌肉神经再生对于恢复运动至关重要。

|近义词：nerve regeneration, reconnection |反义词：denervation|
