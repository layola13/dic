词源:
The word "configured" comes from the verb "configure," which itself derives from the Late Latin word "configurare," meaning "to fashion," "to form," or "to represent."  This in turn combines "con-" (together, with) and "figurare" (to shape, form, figure).  Therefore, "configured" literally means "shaped together" or "formed together," reflecting its meaning of being arranged or set up in a specific way.
