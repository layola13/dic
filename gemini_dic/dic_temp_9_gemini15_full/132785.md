nonductility: /ˌnɒnˈdʌktɪləti/ | n. |非延展性，非展性| Lack of ductility; inability to be drawn out into a wire or hammered thin.  It refers to a material's resistance to deformation under tensile stress.  A nonductile material will fracture or break before it undergoes significant plastic deformation. | Example: The nonductility of the cast iron made it unsuitable for forging.  铸铁的非延展性使其不适合锻造。The brittleness of the material was evident in its pronounced nonductility. 材料的脆性在其明显的非延展性中显而易见。| 近义词：brittleness, rigidity, fragility | 反义词：ductility, malleability | 名词
