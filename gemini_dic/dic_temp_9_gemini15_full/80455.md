The word "gonglike" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Please double-check the spelling.
2. **A neologism:** A newly coined word, perhaps specific to a certain field or community.  If so, more context is needed to define it.
3. **A proper noun:** Possibly a name or place name.  Again, more context is needed.


To help me provide the requested analysis, please provide the following:

* **The intended word:** If you believe there's a misspelling, provide the word you intended to write.
* **Context:** Where did you encounter this word? (e.g., a book, article, conversation)  Providing the sentence or passage where it appears would be extremely helpful.

Once I have this additional information, I can attempt to fulfill your request.
