Etymology:

The word "doughtiest" is the superlative form of the adjective "doughty," meaning brave and strong.  "Doughty" itself has Old English roots, deriving from the Old English word *dūhtig, meaning "valiant, brave, strong." This word is composed of two elements: *dūgan ("to be good, to be able, to avail") and the suffix *-tig, which forms adjectives.  Over time, the meaning shifted slightly, retaining the sense of strength and bravery.


Usage:

The word "doughtiest" is primarily used to describe individuals or groups who demonstrate exceptional bravery and resilience in the face of adversity. It carries a strong connotation of strength, both physical and moral. Because it's a superlative, it implies a comparison, suggesting that the subject is the bravest or strongest among a group.  It's often used in more formal or literary contexts.


Examples:

* The doughtiest knight in the realm faced the fearsome dragon. = 王国里最勇敢的骑士面对可怕的巨龙。

*  She was one of the doughtiest advocates for social justice. = 她是社会正义最顽强的倡导者之一。


Note that because "doughtiest" is a superlative adjective, it doesn't follow typical verb conjugation patterns as verbs or nouns do.  The grammatical structures surrounding it (subject-verb-object, etc.) would determine the overall sentence structure, but "doughtiest" itself remains unchanged for tense or number.  There is no need to provide examples of different verb tenses for this word.
