nonguidable: /ˌnɒnˈɡaɪdəbl/ | adj. | 不可引导的，无法操纵的 | Not capable of being guided or controlled.  The term often implies a lack of responsiveness to external influence or direction. | 例句：The drone was nonguidable after the system malfunction.  无人机系统故障后无法控制。

The experimental aircraft proved nonguidable in high winds. 实验飞机在大风中证明是无法控制的。


近义词：uncontrollable, unmanageable, ungovernable, intractable


反义词：guidable, controllable, manageable


词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "guidable" (capable of being guided). "Guidable" itself derives from the verb "guide," ultimately from Old French *guider and ultimately from the Proto-Germanic *wīsan ("to show the way").
