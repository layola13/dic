词源:
The word "gaze" ultimately derives from the Old French word "gazer," which means "to look, stare."  This, in turn, has roots in the Vulgar Latin word "gaisare," possibly related to the Latin word "os," meaning "mouth."  The connection may be to the act of opening one's mouth in wonder or surprise while looking.
