词源:  Derived from the verb "scavenge," ultimately from Old French *escavenger,  related to Old Norse *skaut ("dish, bowl") and ultimately from Proto-Germanic  *skaut- ("to cut, to scoop, to share").  The original sense related to removing refuse and cleaning streets.  The modern meaning of searching for discarded items developed later.
