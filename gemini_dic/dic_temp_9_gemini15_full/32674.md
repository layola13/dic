词源:The word "chivalry" originates from the Old French word "chevalerie," which literally means "horsemanship."  This reflects the historical association of chivalry with knights, who were mounted warriors.  The Old French word further derives from "cheval," meaning "horse."  Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass the code of conduct and ideals associated with knighthood.
