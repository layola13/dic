词源:
The word "jollification" originates from the word "jolly," meaning cheerful and merry. The suffix "-fication" denotes the process of making something or the state of being something. Therefore, "jollification" literally means "the act of making something jolly" or "the state of being jolly."  The word gained popularity in the 19th century.
