nonuniformist: /ˌnɒnjuːˈnɪfɔːmɪst/ | adj. | 非均质论者；非均变论者 |  An adherent of nonuniformitarianism, a geological theory that opposes uniformitarianism by suggesting that geological processes have varied significantly in intensity and type throughout Earth's history.  This contrasts with uniformitarianism, which posits that geological processes have remained relatively constant over time. | The nonuniformist argued that the catastrophic events shaping the Earth's surface were far more significant than the slow, gradual processes emphasized by uniformitarians. | 近义词：catastrophist (强调灾变) | 反义词：uniformitarian
