词源:
The word "pensioner" comes from the word "pension," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "pensio," meaning "payment" or "weighing."  The suffix "-er" indicates the person who receives the pension.  The evolution reflects the historical context of pensions as payments, often weighed out literally in earlier times.
