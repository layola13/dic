词源:
The word "indisposed" comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the verb "dispose," which ultimately derives from the Old French "disposer" meaning "to arrange, settle, prepare."  The original meaning therefore implied a lack of proper arrangement or preparation, often in relation to one's health or willingness. Over time, the meaning has narrowed primarily to the senses of being slightly unwell or unwilling.
