USAGE->
This word is so rare and specialized that demonstrating its usage across various grammatical tenses is impractical.  Standard grammatical rules apply, but constructing meaningful sentences is challenging given the word's limited applicability.  The word itself is a complex noun, and would act as the subject or object of a sentence, or would be modified by adjectives or adverbs.

PHRASE->
This word is not typically used in phrases.  Its highly specialized nature limits its combinatorial possibilities.
