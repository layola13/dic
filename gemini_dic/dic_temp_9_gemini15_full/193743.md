词源:  The word "self-controls" is a compound noun formed from "self" (referring to oneself) and "controls" (the act of controlling).  The root of "control" traces back to the Old French word "controller," meaning "to check" or "to verify."  This in turn is related to the Latin word "contra-rotulus," meaning "counter-roll," suggesting a system of checks and balances.
