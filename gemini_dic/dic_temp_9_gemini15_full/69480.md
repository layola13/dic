feldspar:/ˈfɛldˌspɑːr/| n. |长石|Feldspar is a group of rock-forming minerals that make up as much as 60% of the Earth's crust. They are tectosilicates, meaning their crystal structures are based on a framework of interconnected silicon and oxygen atoms.  Feldspars are distinguished by their cleavage, which is typically perfect in two directions at nearly 90 degrees.  Different types of feldspar are identified based on their chemical composition, which primarily involves variations in the proportions of potassium, sodium, and calcium.  They are commonly found in igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks.|The granite countertop is primarily composed of feldspar.|近义词：silicate, mineral|反义词：无
