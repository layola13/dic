deinotherium:/ˌdaɪnəʊˈθɪəriəm/| n. |恐象|An extinct genus of proboscideans (mammals with a trunk) that lived in Africa and Eurasia during the Miocene and Pleistocene epochs.  Deinotherium were characterized by their downward-curving lower tusks and relatively smaller upper tusks (or lack thereof). They were large, herbivorous mammals, and their fossils have been found across a wide geographical range. |例句：The discovery of a nearly complete Deinotherium skull provided valuable insights into the evolution of proboscideans.  发现了一个几乎完整的恐象头骨，这为了解长鼻类动物的进化提供了宝贵的资料。

The remains of Deinotherium have been found in various parts of the world, showing their wide distribution. 恐象的遗骸在世界各地都有发现，这表明它们的分布范围很广。|近义词：proboscidean (general term for trunk-bearing mammals)|反义词：None directly applicable;  perhaps "small mammal" in terms of size comparison.
