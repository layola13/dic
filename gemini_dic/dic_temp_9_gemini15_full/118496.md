词源:
The word "mesmerize" comes from the name of Franz Mesmer (1734-1815), an Austrian physician who developed a system of therapy called "mesmerism," which involved inducing a trance-like state in patients through the use of magnets and suggestion.  While his methods are now considered pseudoscientific, the term "mesmerize" persists to describe the captivating effect of something on a person's attention.
