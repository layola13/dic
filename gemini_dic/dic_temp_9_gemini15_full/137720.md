nonvacuously:/ˌnɒnˈvækjʊəsli/ | adv. |非空地；非真空地 |  The term "nonvacuously" means in a way that is not empty or void;  it implies that a condition or statement is true in a meaningful way, not just trivially or by default. It often appears in mathematical or logical contexts where the existence of something is crucial to the validity of a statement. For instance, if a theorem requires the existence of a certain element,  a proof that uses that theorem must demonstrate that element's existence nonvacuously, rather than simply assuming it exists. | Example:  The theorem holds nonvacuously if and only if there exists at least one element satisfying the given condition.  这个定理成立的充分必要条件是至少存在一个元素满足给定的条件。 |近义词: meaningfully, substantially, significantly | 反义词: vacuously, trivially, nominally
