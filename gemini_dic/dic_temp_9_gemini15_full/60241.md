词源:

Effrontery ultimately derives from the Old French word *effronterie*, which itself comes from *effronter*, meaning "to shamelessly confront" or "to brazenly face."  The prefix "ef-" is an alteration of "ex-" (out), and "fronter" is related to the word "front," suggesting a direct, bold facing of something, often in a disrespectful manner.
