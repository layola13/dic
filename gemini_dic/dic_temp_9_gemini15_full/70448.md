词源:
The word "figuratively" is derived from the adjective "figurative," which comes from the Middle English word "figuratif," ultimately tracing back to the Latin word "figurativus," meaning "relating to figures or form."  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb.


用法说明:

"Figuratively" indicates that something is not to be taken literally, but rather as a figure of speech, a metaphor, or a symbolic representation. It describes something expressed indirectly or using imagery rather than directly stating facts.  It contrasts with "literally," which emphasizes a direct and factual interpretation.
