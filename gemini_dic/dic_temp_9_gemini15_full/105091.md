词源:  The word "kernel" ultimately derives from the Old English word "cyrnel," meaning "kernel of a nut, grain." This, in turn, is believed to be related to the Proto-Germanic word "*korniz,"  meaning "grain, kernel."  The meaning has broadened over time to encompass the central or essential part of anything.
