词源:  The word "jolliment" is derived from the Middle English word "jolif," meaning "joyful" or "merry."  This in turn has roots in Old French "jolif," ultimately related to the Latin "gaudium" (joy).  The "-ment" suffix is a common noun-forming suffix in English, indicating a state or condition.  Therefore, "jolliment" literally means "the state of being joyful."


用法说明:

Jolliment is a somewhat archaic or literary word. It's not used frequently in everyday conversation. It suggests a more intense and prolonged period of joyful celebration than simply "fun" or "merriment."  It often implies a degree of boisterous activity and conviviality.
