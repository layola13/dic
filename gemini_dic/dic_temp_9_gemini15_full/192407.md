scrofulous: /ˈskrɒfjʊləs/ | adj. | 患scrofula的；肮脏的；卑鄙的；腐败的 |

英文解析：Scrofulous primarily refers to being affected by scrofula, a form of tuberculosis affecting the lymph nodes, particularly in the neck.  However, it has evolved to also describe something morally corrupt, degraded, or sordid;  something characterized by decay or disease.  The word carries a strong negative connotation.

例句：
The scrofulous sores on his neck were a testament to his poor health. = 他脖子上的溃疡证明了他的健康状况不佳。

His scrofulous dealings led to his downfall. = 他卑鄙的交易导致了他的垮台。


近义词：diseased, corrupt, depraved, sordid, vile, foul, putrid

反义词：clean, pure, honest, virtuous, wholesome

词性：形容词


词源:  The word derives from the Middle English "scrofule," ultimately from the Old French "scrofules," meaning "scrofula."  The medical term scrofula itself came from the Latin "scrofa," meaning "sow,"  possibly because the swollen lymph nodes resembled the folds of skin on a sow's neck.  The later extension of the word's meaning to describe moral corruption likely arose from the association of the disease with poverty and social degradation.
