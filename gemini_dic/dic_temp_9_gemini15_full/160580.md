porphyrization:/ˌpɔːrfɪraɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 斑状结构化；斑状结构作用 | The process by which porphyroblasts (large crystals) grow within a metamorphic rock.  This involves the recrystallization of minerals under conditions of increased temperature and pressure.  The resulting rock texture is characterized by large crystals (porphyroblasts) embedded in a finer-grained matrix. | Example: The porphyrization of the granite resulted in a distinctive texture with large feldspar crystals.  斑状花岗岩的斑状结构作用形成了具有大型长石晶体的独特纹理。|近义词：metamorphism, recrystallization | 反义词：N/A
