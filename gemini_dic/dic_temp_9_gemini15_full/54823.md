dispersibilities: /ˌdɪspɜːrsəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. |分散性，弥散性 | The ability of a substance to be dispersed or spread out.  This term often refers to the ease with which a substance can be distributed or scattered throughout a medium. It's a measure of how readily a material will disperse, often used in contexts like colloid science and materials science.  | Example: The dispersibilities of the nanoparticles in the solvent were carefully measured.  纳米颗粒在溶剂中的分散性得到了仔细测量。 |近义词: dispersity, spreadability |反义词: aggregation, clumping |  名词
