preeffectually: /ˌpriːɪˈfektʃuəli/ | adj. | 预先有效地；提前有效地 |  This word is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word or expression.  It combines the prefix "pre-" (meaning before or in advance) with "effectively" (meaning producing a desired result).  Therefore, the intended meaning is likely "in an effective way beforehand" or "beforehand and effectively". However, its lack of common usage means there's no established dictionary definition, grammatical context, or common phrases associated with it.  Because it's not a real word, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical usages is impossible.  It would need to be used within a specific context to understand the author's intended meaning.
