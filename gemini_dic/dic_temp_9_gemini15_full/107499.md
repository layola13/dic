The word "lanchana" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a word from another language, possibly a transliteration or a proper noun.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible without more context.  To provide the requested analysis, I need more information, such as:

* **The language of origin:** Knowing the language will allow me to find its meaning, etymology, and usage.
* **The context in which you encountered the word:** This will help determine its meaning and part of speech.


Please provide this additional information so I can assist you properly.
