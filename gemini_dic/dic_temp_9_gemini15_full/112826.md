lucifer:/ˈluːsɪfər/ | n. | 撒旦；启明星；光辉者 | Lucifer, in its broadest sense, refers to the light-bearing celestial being, often associated with the morning star, Venus.  However, in religious contexts, particularly Christianity, Lucifer is synonymous with Satan, the fallen angel. The name itself means "light-bearer" in Latin.  The word's usage reflects this duality: it can refer to the beauty and brilliance of the morning star or the malevolent power of Satan. | Example:  The poet used "Lucifer" to symbolize the fallen hero's initial glory and subsequent downfall.  诗人用“路西法”来象征这位堕落英雄最初的光荣和随后的衰败。  | 近义词: Satan, devil, morning star | 反义词:  God, angel (in a religious context)
