词源:
The word "channelling" comes from the Old French word "chanel," meaning "a gutter, channel, canal"  which ultimately derives from the Latin word "canalis," meaning "pipe, channel, watercourse."  The English verb sense developed from the physical act of directing something through a channel to its figurative use of guiding or directing anything along a particular course. The spiritual meaning developed later, likely drawing from the idea of a channel or conduit for energy or communication.
