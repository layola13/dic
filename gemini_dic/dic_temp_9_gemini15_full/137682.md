词源:

The word "nonuniversity" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "university."  The prefix "non-" is derived from Old French "non," ultimately from Latin "non," meaning "not."  "University" has a more complex etymology, tracing back to medieval Latin "universitas," meaning "the whole," "the totality," or "a corporation."  This referred to a corporation of scholars and students.
