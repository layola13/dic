redshift:/ˈrɛdʃɪft/ | n. |红移 |The phenomenon where light from distant objects is stretched out, increasing its wavelength and shifting it towards the red end of the spectrum. This is primarily caused by the expansion of the universe, where objects move away from the observer, causing the light waves to be stretched.  |Example: The redshift of distant galaxies provides evidence for the expanding universe.  红移的遥远星系为宇宙膨胀提供了证据。| blueshift | blueshift | 名词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The redshift of that galaxy is being measured. = 那个星系的红移正在被测量。
Redshift helps astronomers understand the universe's expansion. = 红移帮助天文学家理解宇宙的膨胀。


一般过去时:
Astronomers measured a significant redshift in the quasar. = 天文学家测量到类星体有显著的红移。
The redshift data confirmed the galaxy's distance. = 红移数据证实了星系的距离。


现在完成时:
Scientists have observed redshifts in many distant objects. = 科学家已经观测到许多遥远天体的红移。
They have confirmed the redshift using multiple techniques. = 他们已经使用多种技术证实了红移。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery of redshift, the universe's expansion was unknown. = 在发现红移之前，宇宙的膨胀是未知的。
They had already analyzed the redshift data before the conference. = 他们在会议之前就已经分析了红移数据。


将来时:
Future telescopes will measure redshifts with greater precision. = 未来望远镜将以更高的精度测量红移。
Scientists will use redshift to study the early universe. = 科学家将利用红移来研究早期宇宙。


虚拟语气:
If the redshift were higher, the galaxy would be farther away. = 如果红移更高，星系就更远。
I wish we had better redshift data for this object. = 我希望我们有更好的这个天体的红移数据。


被动语态:
The redshift was carefully calculated by the researchers. = 红移由研究人员仔细计算。
Redshift is often used to determine the distance of celestial bodies. = 红移经常被用来确定天体的距离。


疑问句:
What is the redshift of that star? = 那颗星的红移是多少？
How is redshift measured? = 红移是如何测量的？


否定句:
The redshift was not as large as they initially expected. = 红移并没有像他们最初预期的那样大。
This object shows no significant redshift. = 这个天体没有显示出显著的红移。


PHRASE->

cosmological redshift: 宇宙红移
