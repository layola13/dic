photopolymerizable: /ˌfoʊtoʊpɑːləməraɪzəbl/ | adj. | 可光聚合的 | Capable of undergoing polymerization when exposed to light.  This term describes materials that can be transformed from a liquid or semi-liquid state into a solid state through exposure to light, a process driven by photochemical reactions.  The resulting polymer is often used in various applications, including 3D printing and the creation of specialized coatings. |  This photopolymerizable resin is ideal for high-resolution 3D printing.  这可光聚合树脂非常适合高分辨率3D打印。

The photopolymerizable ink cured quickly under UV light.  这种可光聚合墨水在紫外线下快速固化。|  近义词：light-curable, photo-reactive | 反义词：non-photopolymerizable
