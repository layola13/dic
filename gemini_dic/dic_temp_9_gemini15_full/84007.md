词源:

* **half-**:  Prefix meaning "partly" or "to a limited extent."  Its origins trace back to Old English *healf.

* **discriminating**:  Adjective meaning "able to distinguish," but often used in the context of making unfair or prejudicial distinctions based on race, religion, gender, etc.  It derives from the verb "discriminate," which comes from Latin *discrimen ("difference," "distinction").

The combination of "half-" and "discriminating" creates a new adjective to describe a situation where discrimination is present but not complete or consistent.  It's a relatively modern coinage, reflecting the nuanced ways in which prejudice and bias can manifest.
