词源:

The word "overimaginative" is a compound word formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the adjective "imaginative" (relating to imagination).  "Imaginative" itself derives from "imagination," which comes from the Latin word "imaginatio," meaning "a forming of images in the mind."
