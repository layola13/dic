The word "falcongentil" does not exist in standard English.  It seems to be a possible misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  If you could provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer some educated guesses about its intended meaning and possible derivation.
