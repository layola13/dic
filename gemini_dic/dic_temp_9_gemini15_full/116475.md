词源:

The word "materialising" comes from the verb "materialise," which itself is derived from the noun "material" meaning "physical substance." The suffix "-ise" (or "-ize" in American English) is a verb-forming suffix indicating "to make or become."  Therefore, "materialise" originally meant "to give material form to" or "to become material."  The modern usage has expanded to include the sense of becoming real or apparent, even if not necessarily involving physical matter.
