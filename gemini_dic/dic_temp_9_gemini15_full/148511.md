词源:

The word "oversubtly" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the adverb "subtly" (meaning "in a subtle manner").  "Subtly" itself comes from the adjective "subtle," which originates from the Latin word "subtle," meaning "fine, thin, delicate," related to the Latin word "serere," meaning "to weave."  Therefore, "oversubtly" indicates an excessive degree of subtlety.
