ciliograde: /ˈsɪliəɡreɪd/ | adj. |纤毛级的，纤毛运动的 | Relating to or characterized by ciliary movement.  The term refers to organisms that use cilia for locomotion or feeding. | Example:  Many ciliograde protists are found in aquatic environments.  许多纤毛级原生生物都生存在水生环境中。 | 近义词：ciliated | 反义词：无


USAGE->

过去完成时:
Before the observation, they had hypothesized about the ciliograde's movement. = 在观察之前，他们已经假设了纤毛级的运动方式。
The experiment had demonstrated the effectiveness of ciliograde propulsion. = 实验已经证明了纤毛级推进的有效性。


将来时:
We will study the ciliograde behavior in more detail. = 我们将更详细地研究纤毛级的行为。
Further research will explore the mechanisms of ciliograde movement. = 进一步的研究将探索纤毛级运动的机制。


虚拟语气:
If the organism were ciliograde, it would move in this way. = 如果该生物是纤毛级的，它就会这样移动。
It is important that the ciliograde movement be understood properly. = 正确理解纤毛级运动很重要。


被动语态:
The ciliograde movement was observed under a microscope. = 纤毛级运动是在显微镜下观察到的。

疑问句:
Is this organism ciliograde? = 这个生物是纤毛级的吗？
How does ciliograde locomotion contribute to the organism's survival? = 纤毛级运动如何促进生物的生存？


否定句:
The movement was not ciliograde; it was flagellar. = 这不是纤毛级运动；而是鞭毛运动。
This species does not exhibit typical ciliograde characteristics. = 这个物种没有表现出典型的纤毛级特征。


PHRASE->
ciliograde movement = 纤毛级运动
ciliograde organism = 纤毛级生物
ciliograde locomotion = 纤毛级运动
ciliograde protists = 纤毛级原生生物
ciliograde feeding = 纤毛级摄食


词源:
The word "ciliograde" is a combination of "cilia" (hair-like appendages) and "grade" (step, degree, or a group).  It describes organisms whose movement or feeding is primarily based on the coordinated beating of cilia.
