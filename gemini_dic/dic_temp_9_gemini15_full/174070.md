quasipowerfully:/ˈkwɑːzaɪˈpaʊərflɪ/| adv.|准强有力地，近乎强有力地 |The word "quasipowerfully" is not a standard English word. It's a combination of "quasi" (meaning seemingly, apparently, or to a certain extent) and "powerfully" (meaning with great power or force).  It suggests an action or effect that is powerful but not completely or fully so.  There is no established dictionary definition. It's a neologism, or newly coined word, likely used to convey a nuanced meaning in a specific context.  |例句：The argument was presented quasipowerfully, lacking the final punch to fully convince the audience.  论点虽然表达得比较有力，但缺乏最终的冲击力，无法完全说服听众。The machine ran quasipowerfully, hinting at a potential for greater output.机器运转得比较强劲，暗示着有潜力产生更大的输出。|近义词: powerfully, strongly, forcefully, effectively (but less so)|反义词: weakly, feebly, ineffectively|副词
