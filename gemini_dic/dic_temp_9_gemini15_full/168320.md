词源:

The word is a compound word formed from "pro-" (meaning "in favor of" or "supporting") and "Portuguese" (referring to Portugal or its people and culture).  The prefix "pro-" has Latin origins. "Portuguese" originates from the name of Portugal, which itself has complex etymological roots relating to the port of Porto (Portus Cale).
