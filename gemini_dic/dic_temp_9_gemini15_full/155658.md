词源:  The word derives from the Greek word "phlegma" (phλέγματος), meaning "phlegm," a thick mucus secreted in the respiratory tract.  In ancient medical theory (humoral theory), an excess of phlegm was believed to cause a sluggish and unemotional temperament.  Thus, "phlegmatical" came to describe this personality trait.
