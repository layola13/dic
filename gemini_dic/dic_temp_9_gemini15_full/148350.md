词源:
The word "overspeculated" is formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") to the verb "speculated."  "Speculated" comes from the noun "speculation," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "speculare," meaning "to look," "to observe," or "to consider."  The shift in meaning reflects the act of forming opinions based on incomplete information, a core element of speculation.
