词源:
The word "post-traumatic" is a compound word.  "Post" is a prefix meaning "after" or "behind," derived from Latin. "Traumatic" comes from the Greek word "trauma," meaning "wound" or "injury," often referring to psychological as well as physical injury.  Therefore, "post-traumatic" literally means "after a wound or injury," specifically referring to the consequences after a psychologically significant event.
