词源:
The term "rubbernecking" originated in the early 20th century in the United States.  It's believed to be a combination of "rubber" (referring to the flexible neck of a rubber doll or toy) and "necking" (meaning to stretch or crane one's neck).  The imagery is of someone stretching their neck like a rubber doll to see something.
