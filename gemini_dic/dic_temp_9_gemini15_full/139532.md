词源:
The word "obtenebration" comes from the Latin words "ob-" (meaning "against" or "towards") and "tenebrae" (meaning "darkness" or "shadows").  The suffix "-ation" indicates the process or state of being.  Therefore, the word literally means "the act of bringing into darkness" or "the state of being darkened."
