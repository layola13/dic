词源:

The word "mutiny" comes from the Old French word "mutiner," meaning "to stir up," "to riot," or "to murmur."  This, in turn, likely originates from the Latin word "mutire," meaning "to mutter" or "to grumble."  The evolution reflects the initial stages of rebellion often involving grumbling and discontent before escalating into open revolt.
