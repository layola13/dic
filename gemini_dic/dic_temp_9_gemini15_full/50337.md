词源:
The word "deployable" is derived from the verb "deploy," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "desployer," meaning "to unfold" or "to spread out."  This in turn has roots in the Latin prefix "dis-" (apart, away) and "plicare" (to fold).  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or suitability.  Therefore, "deployable" literally means "capable of being unfolded or spread out," reflecting its use in describing things that can be readily put into action or position.
