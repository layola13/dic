词源:

* **semi-**:  Latin prefix meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."
* **solemn**: From Latin *solemnis*, meaning "holy day," "festive," "of a feast day," ultimately from *sol*, "sun."  The connection to "serious" developed over time, likely due to the seriousness and ritual associated with religious festivals.


用法说明:

semisolemn is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that is partly or somewhat solemn, but not completely serious or formal. It suggests a blend of seriousness and a relaxed atmosphere.  It's not a commonly used word, and its usage is generally limited to situations where a nuanced description of formality is required.
