proto-hominid:/ˈproʊtoʊ ˈhɒmɪnɪd/|/ˈproʊtoʊ ˈhɑːmənɪd/| n. |早期人类；原人|An early hominid is a member of the human family (Hominidae) that existed before the emergence of Homo sapiens.  They represent a stage in human evolution prior to the development of fully modern humans.  These are often characterized by bipedalism (walking upright), increasingly larger brain sizes compared to earlier primates, and the use of tools. |Example:  The discovery of "Lucy" provided significant insights into the characteristics of proto-hominids.  早期“露西”的发现为了解原人的特征提供了重要的见解。|近义词: early hominid, hominin ancestor |反义词: modern human, Homo sapiens
