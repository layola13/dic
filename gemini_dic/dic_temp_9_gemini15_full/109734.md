词源:  The word "leveraged" comes from the noun "lever," meaning a simple machine consisting of a rigid bar resting on a pivot, used to move a heavy or firmly fixed load with one end when pressure is applied to the other.  The metaphorical extension to finance and business signifies using a relatively small amount of resources (the pressure) to move or control a much larger amount (the load).  The "-aged" suffix indicates the past participle form of the verb "leverage," meaning to use something to maximum advantage.
