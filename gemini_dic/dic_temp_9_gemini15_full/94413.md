/ɪmˈplɪkətɪvnəsɪz/ | n. | 含蓄性；暗示性 | The multiple implicativenesses of the poem make it open to various interpretations.  这首诗的多种含蓄性使其可以有多种解读。 |  nuances, suggestions, implications | explicitness | 名词


This word is not a standard English word found in common dictionaries.  It's likely a nonce word, meaning a word coined for a specific occasion or context, formed by adding the plural suffix "-es" to "implicativeness," which itself is a less common word.


Let's break down the word's components:


* **implicative:**  This adjective means "implying something indirectly; suggestive."  It derives from "imply," which comes from the Latin "implicare" meaning "to enfold, involve, or entangle."


* **-ness:** This suffix transforms adjectives into nouns, indicating a state, quality, or condition.


* **-es:** This suffix is the regular plural marker for nouns ending in "-s," "-sh," "-ch," "-x," or "-z".


Therefore, "implicativenesses" attempts to represent multiple instances or aspects of indirect suggestion or implication.  However, due to its unusual nature, it’s best to use clearer alternatives such as "multiple implications," "various suggestions," or "different nuances."
