词源:

The word "inveigh" ultimately derives from the Old French word *enveier*, meaning "to send against,"  which itself comes from the Latin *invehere*, meaning "to carry in," "to bring in," or figuratively, "to attack," "to assail."  The sense shifted over time from a more neutral "to carry against" to the strong negative connotation of "to attack verbally."
