pre-Moslems:/ˌpriːˈmɒzlɪmz/| adj.|伊斯兰教兴起之前的|The term "pre-Moslems" refers to the period and people existing before the rise of Islam.  It describes the era and individuals inhabiting a region before the advent of Islamic rule or influence. The term can be used to describe social structures, cultural practices, religions, and political systems that existed prior to the spread of Islam.  However, it's important to note that the term can be considered imprecise and potentially problematic, as it implies a monolithic pre-Islamic world, which often overlooked the diversity of existing cultures and beliefs.  A more nuanced approach might involve specifying the region and period in question and focusing on specific cultural or historical aspects. |The pre-Moslem inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula were largely polytheistic. = 伊斯兰教兴起之前的阿拉伯半岛居民大多是多神教徒。|近义词: pre-Islamic, ante-Islamic |反义词: post-Islamic, Islamic
