/ˌpriːˈwɜːðɪnəs/| n. |预先值得；预先应得；先有价值|The preworthiness of a project refers to its inherent value or potential benefit before any work or investment is made.  It's an assessment of the potential return on investment before the investment itself.  This concept is particularly relevant in fields like venture capital and project management. |The preworthiness of this innovative technology is undeniable, attracting significant investor interest.  |  |  |名词


The word "preworthiness" is not a standard English word and doesn't appear in major dictionaries.  It seems to be a newly coined word, likely combining "pre-" (meaning before) and "worthiness" (meaning deserving of respect, honor, or attention).  Therefore, providing traditional linguistic analysis like etymology and detailed grammatical usage examples is not possible.  The meaning and usage are inferred from the apparent combination of its constituent parts.


Since it's a neologism, there are no established near synonyms or antonyms.  Any attempt to create them would be highly speculative.  The closest existing concept might be terms like "potential value," "intrinsic merit," or "projected worth," depending on the context.  The antonym might be something like "unpromising" or "lacking potential."


USAGE->

Because "preworthiness" is not a standard word, illustrating its usage in various grammatical tenses and moods is artificial and unproductive.  Its use would be context-dependent, and the sentence structure would reflect the intended meaning within that context. For example:

Simple Present: The committee assessed the preworthiness of each proposal. (委员会评估了每个提案的预先价值。)

Simple Past:  Investors judged the preworthiness of the startup to be high. (投资者认为这家初创企业的预先价值很高。)


PHRASE->

Since "preworthiness" is a newly coined word, there are no established phrases using it. Any phrases would be context-dependent and potentially contrived.
