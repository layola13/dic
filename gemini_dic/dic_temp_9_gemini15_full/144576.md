词源：  The word "outwasted" is a relatively uncommon word formed by adding the prefix "out-" to the past participle "wasted."  "Out-" indicates exceeding a limit or surpassing something.  "Wasted" comes from the Old English "wæstian," meaning "to lay waste" or "to desolate."  Therefore, "outwasted" literally means "excessively wasted" or "wasted beyond the limit."
