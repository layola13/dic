词源:
The word "hydration" comes from the French word "hydratation," which in turn is derived from the Greek word "hydor" (ὕδωρ), meaning "water," and the suffix "-ation," indicating a process or action.  Therefore, "hydration" literally means "the process of becoming watery" or "the process of combining with water".
