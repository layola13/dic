The word "predependences" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  If it were intended to be a word, it would likely be formed from "pre-" and "dependence,"  creating a word related to things that are dependent on something else *before* something else happens.  However, without more context on where you encountered this word, a precise definition and usage analysis is impossible.

To illustrate how a proper analysis would look, let's analyze the word "dependence":
