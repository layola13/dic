词源:

* **high:**  Old English *hēah*, meaning "high, tall, lofty."  Its meaning has remained consistent over time.

* **performance:**  From Old French *performance*, ultimately from Latin *performantia*, a noun formed from the verb *performare*, meaning "to perform, carry out, accomplish."  This verb is a combination of *per* (through, thoroughly) and *formare* (to shape, form).  Thus, "performance" originally referred to the act of carrying something out completely or thoroughly.
