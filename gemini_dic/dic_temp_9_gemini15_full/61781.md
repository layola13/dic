The word "emperished" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling or provide the context in which you encountered this word?  Possible intended words could be "empoverished," "impoverished," or even a less common word altogether depending on context.

2. **A neologism or newly coined word:**  It's possible the word is very recently created and hasn't gained widespread use or dictionary inclusion yet.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **A word from a dialect or specialized jargon:** This word may be used within a specific community or field but not in general English.

Without knowing the intended word or context, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  Please provide more information so I can assist you better.
