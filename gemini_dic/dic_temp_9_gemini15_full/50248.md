dependent-clauses:/dɪˈpɛndənt klɔːzɪz/| n.|从句|A dependent clause, also known as a subordinate clause, is a group of words that contains a subject and a verb but does not express a complete thought. It relies on an independent clause to complete its meaning.  It often begins with a subordinating conjunction (e.g., because, although, if, since, while) or a relative pronoun (e.g., who, whom, whose, which, that).|例句：Because it was raining, the game was cancelled. (因为下雨，比赛取消了。)  Although she tried hard, she failed the exam. (虽然她努力了，但她考试不及格。) |近义词：subordinate clause|反义词：independent clause|n.

词源:

* **dependent:**  From Old French *dependent*, from Latin *dependēns*, present participle of *dependēre* "to hang down from," from *de-* "from, down" + *pendēre* "to hang."  The sense of "relying on" developed later.

* **clause:** From Old French *clause*, from Latin *clausula* "a small clause, a sentence," diminutive of *claus-*, past participle stem of *claudere* "to close, shut."  The connection is that a clause is a grammatically complete unit, like a closed-off section of a sentence.


用法说明:

Dependent clauses cannot stand alone as complete sentences; they need an independent clause to create a complete thought.  They function as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs within a sentence.


  * **Noun Clauses:** Function as the subject or object of a verb.  (e.g., *That he is honest is clear.*)

  * **Adjective Clauses:** Modify nouns or pronouns. (e.g., *The book that I borrowed is interesting.*)

  * **Adverb Clauses:** Modify verbs, adjectives, or adverbs. (e.g., *Because it was raining, the game was cancelled.*)
