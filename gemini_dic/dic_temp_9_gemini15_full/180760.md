regularizer:/ˈreɡjələraɪzər/| n. |正则化器，正则项|A regularizer is a penalty term added to a loss function to prevent overfitting in machine learning models.  It discourages complex models by penalizing large weights or parameters.  This helps the model generalize better to unseen data. |Example: L1 and L2 regularization are common types of regularizers used in machine learning.  L1 regularization adds the absolute value of the weights to the loss function, while L2 regularization adds the square of the weights. |近义词:penalty term, constraint, regularisation term|反义词:None|名词
