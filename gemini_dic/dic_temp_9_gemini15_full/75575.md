词源:  The word "fuddled" originates from the Middle English word "fuddelen," meaning "to be confused or muddled."  This likely derives from a now-obsolete word related to "fudd," meaning something soft or spongy. The sense of being mentally muddled, like a soft, shapeless thing, evolved into the modern meaning.  The connection to intoxication developed later, associating the mental confusion with the effects of alcohol.
