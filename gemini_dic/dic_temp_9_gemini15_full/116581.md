matriarchies:/ˈmeɪtriˌɑːrkiːz/| n. |母系社会；母权制社会 |A matriarchy is a social system where women hold the primary power.  It contrasts with a patriarchy, where men hold the primary power. Matriarchies are often characterized by female-led families, inheritance through the female line, and women holding significant political and economic roles. However, true matriarchies, where women exclusively hold power, are rare in recorded history. Most societies exhibit some level of patriarchal influence.| Example: Some anthropological studies have suggested the existence of matriarchal societies in certain parts of the world, although these claims are often debated.  有些人类学研究表明，世界上某些地区存在母系社会，尽管这些说法常常受到争议。|近义词：female-dominated societies, gynocracies |反义词：patriarchies
