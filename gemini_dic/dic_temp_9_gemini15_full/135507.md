nonplanar: /ˌnɒnˈpleɪnər/ | adj. |非平面的| Not able to be contained in a single plane; three-dimensional.  A nonplanar graph is one that cannot be drawn on a plane without edges crossing.  | 例句：The molecule's structure is nonplanar, resulting in steric hindrance. 分子的结构是非平面的，导致空间位阻。

The complex arrangement of the pipes made it a nonplanar system. 管道的复杂布置使其成为一个非平面系统。


近义词：three-dimensional, spatial, non-coplanar | 反义词：planar, coplanar

词性：形容词


USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective and doesn't conjugate like verbs.  Therefore, tense considerations are irrelevant.  The usage is consistent across different sentence structures.  Examples are given below to illustrate different sentence constructions.


肯定句:
The model is nonplanar. = 这个模型是非平面的。
The design incorporates a nonplanar surface. = 该设计包含一个非平面表面。


否定句:
The structure is not nonplanar; it's actually planar. = 该结构并非非平面；实际上它是平面的。
The circuit is not designed to be nonplanar. = 该电路并非设计成非平面的。


疑问句:
Is the graph nonplanar? = 该图是非平面的吗？
Is the surface of the object nonplanar? = 该物体的表面是非平面的吗？


被动语态 (rare, as it describes an inherent property):
The design was deemed nonplanar by the engineers. = 工程师认为该设计是非平面的。(This is an example where 'nonplanar' is used passively, but this is relatively uncommon.)


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "nonplanar". The usage is primarily in technical fields like mathematics, chemistry, and engineering.  The following examples illustrate its use in technical contexts:


nonplanar graph: 非平面图
nonplanar molecule: 非平面分子
nonplanar surface: 非平面表面
nonplanar structure: 非平面结构
nonplanar geometry: 非平面几何


词源:
The word "nonplanar" is a compound word.  It consists of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "planar" (from "plane," referring to a flat surface).  Therefore, it literally means "not planar" or "not flat."  The term's origins lie in geometry and its extension to other fields describing three-dimensional structures.
