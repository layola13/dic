Word Origin:

The word is derived from "cyberneticist" + the possessive apostrophe 's'.  "Cyberneticist" itself comes from "cybernetics," coined in 1948 by Norbert Wiener,  combining the Greek word "kubernetes" (meaning steersman or governor) and "-ics" (suffix indicating a field of study).  Therefore, "cyberneticist" literally means someone who studies or works in the field of cybernetics.
