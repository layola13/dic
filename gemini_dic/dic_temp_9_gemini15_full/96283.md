词源:
The word "indifference" comes from the Old French word "indifference," which itself derives from the Latin word "indifferentia."  The prefix "in-" means "not," "differentia" means "difference," thus literally meaning "not making a difference," or "lack of distinction."  The evolution of the word reflects its meaning: a lack of distinction or preference, leading to apathy or lack of concern.
