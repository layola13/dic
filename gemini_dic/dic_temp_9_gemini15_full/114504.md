词源:

* **mal-**:  A prefix meaning "bad," "ill," or "wrong."  It comes from Old French *mal* and ultimately from Latin *malus*.

* **adjust**:  Meaning "to put in order," "to regulate," or "to adapt." It comes from Old French *ajuster*, from *a- (to)* + *juster (to join)*.  The root is related to the Latin *jungere* (to join).

Therefore, "maladjusted" literally means "badly adjusted" or "poorly adapted."
