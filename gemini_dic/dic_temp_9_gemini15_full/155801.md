/ˌfoʊnoʊˈtæktɪks/ | n. | 音节结构学；音位排列学 | The study of the permitted combinations of sounds (phonemes) in a particular language.  Phonotactics describes the rules that govern the possible sequences of sounds in a language.  For example, English allows "str" at the beginning of a word (as in "street"), but not "rts".  It's a crucial aspect of phonology, helping to explain why certain sound sequences are possible and others are not. | The phonotactics of English are quite complex, with many restrictions on consonant clusters. | 近义词: sound patterning, sound structure | 反义词:  (no direct antonym, but the opposite concept would be unrestricted sound combination) |
