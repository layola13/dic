WORD ORIGIN->

The word "self-unity" is a modern coinage, a compound word formed from "self" (referring to oneself) and "unity" (meaning oneness or wholeness).  Both words have ancient roots in the Germanic and Latin languages, respectively.  The combination reflects the modern psychological understanding of the individual's quest for internal coherence and integration.
