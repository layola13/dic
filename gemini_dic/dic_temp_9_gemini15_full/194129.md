self-inductive:/ˌsɛlfɪnˈdʌktɪv/| adj. |自感(的)，自诱(的)|Relating to or caused by self-induction, the production of an electromotive force in a conductor by a change in the current flowing through it.  It describes the phenomenon where a changing current in a coil induces a voltage in the same coil.|The self-inductive properties of the coil are crucial for its operation in the circuit.|近义词：self-generating|反义词：externally induced
