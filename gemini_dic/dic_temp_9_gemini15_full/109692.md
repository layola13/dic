The word "leukeness" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure field.  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
