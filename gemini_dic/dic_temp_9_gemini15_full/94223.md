词源:

The word "imperialistic" is derived from "imperialism," which in turn comes from "imperial" + "-ism."  "Imperial" traces back to the Latin word "imperialis," meaning "of or belonging to an emperor or empire."  The suffix "-ism" denotes a doctrine, system, or practice.  Therefore, "imperialistic" describes something related to the policy of extending a nation's power and influence through diplomacy or military force.
