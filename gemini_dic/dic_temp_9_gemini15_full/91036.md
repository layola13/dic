Etymology:

The word "huskiness" derives from the noun "husk," meaning the dry outer covering of a seed or fruit.  The connection lies in the similar texture and sound: a husk is rough and dry, and a husky voice sounds rough and dry due to a lack of lubrication in the vocal cords.  The "-iness" suffix transforms the noun "husk" into an adjective ("husky") and then further into the noun "huskiness," signifying the state or quality of being husky.
