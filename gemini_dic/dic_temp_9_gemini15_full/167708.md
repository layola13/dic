词源:
The word "priestcap" is a compound word.  "Priest" derives from the Old French *prestre, ultimately from the Latin *presbyter, meaning "elder" or "priest".  "Cap" comes from the Old French *cape, ultimately from the Latin *cappa, meaning "cloak" or "hood". Therefore, "priestcap" literally means a cap worn by a priest.
