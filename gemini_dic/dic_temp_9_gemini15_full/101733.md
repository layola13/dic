词源:
irresistibilities is the plural form of irresistibility.  Irresistibility is derived from the adjective "irresistible," which combines the prefix "ir-" (meaning "not") with "resist," meaning "to withstand or oppose."  The suffix "-ibility" forms a noun indicating a quality or state. Therefore, irresistibility means "the quality of being impossible to resist."
