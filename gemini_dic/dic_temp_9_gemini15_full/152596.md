词源:

The word "peacekeeping" is a compound word formed by combining "peace" and "keeping."  "Peace" comes from the Old French "pais," ultimately from the Latin "pax," meaning "peace." "Keeping" derives from the Old English "cepian," meaning "to keep, hold, or guard."  Therefore, "peacekeeping" literally means "the act of keeping peace."
