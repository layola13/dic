词源:  The adverb "primly" derives from the adjective "prim," which itself comes from the obsolete adjective "prime," meaning "first-rate" or "excellent."  However, the meaning shifted over time. By the 17th century, "prim" began to acquire its modern sense of "affectedly precise or proper," often suggesting a stiffness or formality.  This shift is likely connected to the sense of "primed" (prepared, ready), suggesting a person who is overly prepared and thus stiff in their behavior.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective "prim" into its adverbial form, indicating the manner or way in which something is done.
