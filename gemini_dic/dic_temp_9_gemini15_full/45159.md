词源:
The word "cue" ultimately derives from the Old French word "queue," meaning "tail."  This refers to the practice in theatre where the last word of a speech was written on a piece of paper attached to the end (tail) of the script, serving as a reminder for the next actor to start their lines.  Over time, the meaning broadened to include any signal or prompt.
