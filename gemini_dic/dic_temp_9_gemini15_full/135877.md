词源：

The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "providential," which derives from the noun "providence," ultimately from the Latin word "providentia," meaning "foresight, providence."  "Providence" in this context refers to the protective care of God or a higher power.  Therefore, "nonprovidential" literally means "not guided by divine providence."
