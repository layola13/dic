/ˌoʊvərˈɪntrəstɪdnɪsəz/ | n. | 过度关注；过度兴趣的各种表现 |  The word "overinterestednesses" is not a standard English word. It's a nonce word, meaning it's created for a specific occasion and is not found in dictionaries. It's formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to "overinterested," which itself is an adjective meaning excessively interested. The "-nesses" suffix typically creates a plural noun denoting multiple instances or qualities of the adjective. Therefore, "overinterestednesses" would imply multiple instances or aspects of excessive interest.  However, due to its unusual nature, it's unlikely to be encountered in common usage.  There are no standard examples or phrases using this word. | 近义词: excessive enthusiasms, multiple instances of overinterest | 反义词: apathy, indifference | n.
