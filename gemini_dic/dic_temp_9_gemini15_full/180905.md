The word "reices" is not a recognized word in standard English.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* It's a proper noun:  Is it a name, place, or brand?
* It's a technical term:  Is it from a specific field like medicine or engineering?
* It's a neologism or slang:  Is it a newly coined word or informal term?

Please provide the correct spelling or more context, and I will be happy to help.
