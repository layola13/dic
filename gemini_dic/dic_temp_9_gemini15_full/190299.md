词源:
The word "sarcastically" is derived from the adjective "sarcastic," which in turn comes from the Greek word "sarkazein," meaning "to speak bitterly" or "to gnash the teeth."  The original Greek implied a tearing or gnashing action, suggesting the aggression often present in sarcastic speech.  The word entered English through French.
