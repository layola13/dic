The word "prederivations" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism or a misspelling.  There's no established pronunciation, meaning, or usage.  To provide an analysis following your requested format would be impossible without further context or clarification on what the intended word is.  If you meant a different word, or could provide more information about the intended meaning, I can try to help.
