词源:  The word "caperclaw" appears to be a relatively modern coinage, a blend of "caper" (a playful, mischievous act) and "claw" (suggesting a rough or aggressive element).  There is no established etymology in standard dictionaries as it's not a widely used or formally recognized word.  The combination suggests a mischievous act with a slightly violent or rough edge.
