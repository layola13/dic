词源:

The word "matchlessness" is derived from the word "matchless," which itself combines:

* **match:**  Meaning "equal" or "similar," ultimately from Old French *matche*, from Latin *maticula* (a small knot).  This evolution highlights a shift from a physical match to a metaphorical one (something equal in quality).

* **-less:**  A suffix indicating "without" or "lacking."

Therefore, "matchless" means "without equal," and "matchlessness" signifies "the state or quality of being without equal."
