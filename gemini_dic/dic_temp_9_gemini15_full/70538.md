词源:

The word "filibuster" ultimately derives from the Dutch word *vrijbuiter*, meaning "freebooter" or "pirate."  In the 19th century, it came to refer to adventurers who engaged in unauthorized military expeditions, particularly in Latin America. Its application to legislative obstruction arose later, reflecting the image of a pirate disrupting the normal course of events.
