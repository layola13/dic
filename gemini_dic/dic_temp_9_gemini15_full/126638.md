词源:

The word "naive" comes from the French word "naif," meaning "natural," "unpretentious," or "artless."  It entered English in the 19th century, primarily in the context of art, referring to a style characterized by simplicity and lack of sophistication.  Over time, its meaning broadened to include the more general sense of lacking worldly experience and wisdom.
