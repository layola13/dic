词源:
The word "projection" comes from the Old French word "projectioun," which itself derives from the Latin word "projectio," meaning "a throwing forward."  The Latin word is formed from the verb "projicere," meaning "to throw forward," which is a combination of "pro-" (forward) and "jacere" (to throw).  The modern English meaning evolved from the literal sense of throwing something forward to encompass figurative meanings like predictions and estimations.
