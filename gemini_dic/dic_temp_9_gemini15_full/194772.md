The word "selling-off" is a compound noun formed from the present participle "selling" and the preposition "off."  "Selling" derives from the Old English "sellan," meaning "to give, deliver, sell."  "Off" is an Old English preposition indicating separation or removal.  The combination signifies the act of selling something quickly and decisively, often at a reduced price.
