词源:

The word "commissionaire" originates from the French word "commissionnaire," which literally means "one who receives a commission."  The term evolved to describe individuals who were employed to carry out tasks or errands on behalf of others, often receiving a commission or fee for their services. Over time, the term has come to be more specifically associated with uniformed personnel working in building security and related services.
