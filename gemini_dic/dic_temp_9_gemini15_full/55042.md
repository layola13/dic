词源:

The word "disquietness" is derived from the verb "disquiet," which itself comes from the Old French word "desquietier," meaning "to make restless" or "to disturb."  The prefix "dis-" indicates negation or reversal, while "-quiet" relates to the state of being quiet or peaceful.  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "disquiet" into a noun, denoting the state or quality of being disquieted.  Therefore, disquietness literally means "the state of being unsettled or disturbed."
