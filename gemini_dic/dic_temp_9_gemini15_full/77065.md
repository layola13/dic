词源:

The word "garnisher" comes from the Old French word "garnir," meaning "to furnish, equip, supply, or adorn."  This, in turn, has roots in the Germanic word "warnian," meaning "to warn," which evolved to include the sense of preparing or equipping something for a purpose.  The transition to "adorn" likely reflects the decorative aspects of furnishing and equipping, especially in the context of food presentation.
