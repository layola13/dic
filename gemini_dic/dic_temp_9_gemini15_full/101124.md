词源:
The word "investible" is derived from the verb "invest," ultimately from the Latin word "investire," meaning "to clothe," "to dress," or "to surround."  The financial sense developed later, implying the surrounding of capital with potential for growth.  The suffix "-ible" makes it an adjective, meaning capable of being invested in.
