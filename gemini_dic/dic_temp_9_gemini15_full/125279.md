The word "multifetation" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or recognized linguistic resources.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or technical field.

To provide helpful information, we need clarification:

* **Is this a misspelling?**  If so, could you provide the intended word?
* **Is this a technical term?** If so, from what field?  (e.g., medicine, engineering, etc.)
* **Is this a newly coined word?** If so, what is its intended meaning and context?


If you can provide more information about the context in which you encountered this word, I can attempt a more accurate analysis or suggest possible corrections.
