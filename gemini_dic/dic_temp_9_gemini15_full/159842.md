polyhybrid: /ˌpɒliˈhaɪbrɪd/ | /ˌpɑːliˈhaɪbrɪd/ | adj. | 多基因杂交的；多重杂种的 |  Describing an organism or cross that involves multiple gene pairs differing in alleles.  It refers to a hybrid resulting from a cross between parents differing in more than one pair of genes. | Example: The experiment involved studying the inheritance patterns in a polyhybrid cross of pea plants, considering flower color, seed shape, and plant height.  | 近义词: multihybrid, multiple-gene hybrid | 反义词: monohybrid, dihybrid |  adj.
