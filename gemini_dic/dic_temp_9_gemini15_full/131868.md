词源:

The word "nonconsumptions" is a compound word formed from:

* **non-**: a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of".
* **consumption**:  From Old French "consumpcion", from Latin "consumptionem" (nominative "consumptio"), from "consumere" meaning "to consume" (con- "completely" + sumere "to take").

Therefore, "nonconsumptions" literally means "not consumptions" or the absence of consumption.
