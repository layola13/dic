preorganizations:/ˌpriːˌɔːrɡənaɪˈzeɪʃənz/ | n. |预先组织，事先组织 |  The term "preorganizations" refers to structures or groups formed before a main event or activity, often to facilitate its execution. It implies planning and preparation that occurs in advance.  This is not a standard dictionary word; it's a compound noun formed by combining "pre" and "organizations."  Therefore, its usage is highly context-dependent. | Example:  The success of the festival depended heavily on the thorough preorganizations undertaken by the committee.  节日成功很大程度上取决于委员会事先进行的周密组织。 |近义词:advance preparations, prior arrangements, preliminary organization |反义词:last-minute arrangements, impromptu organization |名词
