词源:
The word "clench" comes from the Middle English word "clenchen," which in turn originates from the Old English word "clyncjan," meaning "to close tightly."  The original sense implied a metallic sound accompanying the action of closing.  Over time, the metallic association faded, leaving only the sense of firm closure.
