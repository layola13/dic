词源:
The word "doat" comes from the Middle English word "doten," meaning "to be foolish or senile."  This, in turn, likely derives from the Old English word "dōtian," with a similar meaning.  The connection to "dote" (to be foolishly fond) is clear and reflects the evolving semantic field of the word.
