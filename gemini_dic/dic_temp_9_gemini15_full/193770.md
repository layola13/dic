* **deception**: From Old French *deception, ultimately derived from Latin *deceptio, meaning "a deceiving, a fraud."  This is composed of *de- (from *de), meaning "away, down, from," and *captio, meaning "a taking, seizing, catching."  The sense developed from the idea of "being caught" in a lie or a trick.
