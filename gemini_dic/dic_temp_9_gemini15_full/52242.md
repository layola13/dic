dibasic:/ˌdaɪˈbeɪsɪk/| adj.| 二元的，二价的 | Having two replaceable hydrogen atoms in a molecule, capable of neutralizing two molecules of a monobasic acid.  A dibasic acid is also called a diprotic acid.  | Example: Sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) is a dibasic acid because it has two replaceable hydrogen atoms.  硫酸 (H₂SO₄) 是一种二元酸，因为它有两个可被取代的氢原子。|近义词：diprotic | 反义词：monobasic


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Sulfuric acid is a dibasic acid. = 硫酸是一种二元酸。
This compound is dibasic in nature. = 这种化合物本质上是二元的。


一般过去时:
The chemist determined the acid to be dibasic. = 化学家确定该酸为二元酸。
We found that the substance was dibasic. = 我们发现该物质是二元的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified many dibasic acids. = 科学家们已经鉴定了许多二元酸。
Researchers have confirmed its dibasic properties. = 研究人员已经证实了它的二元特性。


过去完成时:
They had already known the compound was dibasic before the experiment. = 他们在实验之前就已经知道该化合物是二元的。
The analysis had shown that the solution was dibasic in nature. = 分析表明该溶液本质上是二元的。


将来时:
The experiment will show whether the acid is dibasic or not. = 实验将显示该酸是否是二元酸。
We will determine if the compound is dibasic. = 我们将确定该化合物是否为二元的。


虚拟语气:
If it were a dibasic acid, it would neutralize two molecules of base. = 如果它是一种二元酸，它将中和两个碱分子。
I wish I had known it was dibasic earlier. = 我真希望我早点知道它是二元的。


被动语态:
The acid was identified as dibasic by the researchers. = 该酸被研究人员鉴定为二元酸。
Its dibasic nature was confirmed by the analysis. = 其二元特性已通过分析得到证实。


疑问句:
Is this compound dibasic? = 这种化合物是二元的吗？
Are there many other dibasic acids besides sulfuric acid? = 除硫酸外，还有许多其他二元酸吗？


否定句:
This acid is not dibasic; it's monobasic. = 这种酸不是二元的；它是单元的。
The substance is not dibasic; it has only one replaceable hydrogen atom. = 该物质不是二元的；它只有一个可被取代的氢原子。


PHRASE->
dibasic acid = 二元酸
dibasic phosphate = 二元磷酸盐
dibasic calcium phosphate = 二元磷酸钙
dibasic potassium phosphate = 二元磷酸钾
dibasic salt = 二元盐
