The word "eghen" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A proper noun:** It might be a name or place name, but without more context, it's impossible to say.
* **A word from a dialect or slang:**  It might be a word used in a specific region or community.
* **A newly coined word:** It could be a newly invented word.


Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you would like further assistance.
