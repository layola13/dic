词源:
Postliminy is derived from the Latin phrase *postliminium*, which literally means "after the threshold" or "after the limit."  It originally referred to the return of a person or thing from captivity or enemy territory, with the restoration of their former status.  The term gradually evolved to encompass the broader legal concept of the restoration of rights and possessions after a period of suspension or loss.
