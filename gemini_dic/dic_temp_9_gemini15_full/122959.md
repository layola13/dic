The word "mummy" is not in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling of "mommy," which itself is an informal term.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format isn't possible for "mummy" in the standard sense.  I can, however, provide an analysis for "mommy" and touch upon the potential confusion with "mummy."


**mommy:**

/ˈmɑːmi/ (US) /ˈmʌmi/ (UK) | n. | 妈妈 | Informal term for mother.  A child's word for their mother, often used playfully or affectionately. |  例句：Mommy, can I have a cookie? 妈妈，我能吃块饼干吗？

例句：Mommy is making dinner. 妈妈正在做饭。


近义词：mother, mom, mama


反义词：None (it's a term of endearment, not something with a direct opposite)


词性：Noun


**USAGE->**  (Since "mommy" is a noun, the grammatical usages are limited.  It primarily functions as a subject or object in a sentence.)

Subject: Mommy sings beautifully.  妈妈唱歌很美。
Object:  I love Mommy. 我爱妈妈。



**PHRASE->** (Phrases involving "mommy" are largely informal and contextual.)

Mommy's little helper (妈妈的小帮手)
Mommy's boy/girl (妈宝男/妈宝女)



**Regarding "mummy":**

"Mummy" has two distinct meanings:

1. **(UK spelling of "mummy"):**  This is an alternate spelling of "mommy," identical in meaning and usage.

2. **(Ancient Egyptian context):**  This refers to an embalmed body, specifically an ancient Egyptian corpse preserved through mummification.  This has a different etymology and usage entirely.  Its analysis would look very different.


Because the original request was unclear and likely contained a misspelling, I've answered based on the more likely intended word, "mommy".  If you intended the ancient Egyptian meaning of "mummy," please clarify.
