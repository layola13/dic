词源:  The word "cheekless" is a direct combination of "cheek" and the suffix "-less". "Cheek," in this context, refers to audacity or impudence, not the facial feature. The "-less" suffix indicates the absence of a quality, resulting in the meaning "lacking cheek" or "lacking shame."  The evolution of "cheek" to mean impudence is rooted in the historical association of boldness and impudence with a flushed or ruddy complexion.
