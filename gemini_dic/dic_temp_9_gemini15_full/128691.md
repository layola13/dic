The word "nidgery" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), it might be possible to determine the intended word.
* **It's slang or jargon:**  It might be a newly coined word, a regionalism, or slang used within a specific community.  Again, context is crucial.
* **It's a proper noun:** It might be a proper noun (a name, place, or organization) that hasn't been included in dictionaries yet.
