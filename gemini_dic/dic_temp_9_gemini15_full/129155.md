The term "no-no" is a reduplication of "no," emphasizing the prohibition.  Its origin is informal and its usage is primarily spoken English, although it appears in writing, especially in informal contexts.  There is no documented single origin point, instead it reflects a natural linguistic process of emphasis through repetition.
