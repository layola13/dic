词源:  Derived from "cat," likely referencing the perceived slyness and sometimes aggressive behavior of cats. The association is metaphorical, linking the sharp claws and potentially unpredictable nature of a cat to a person's sharp and potentially hurtful words.  The evolution of the word reflects a shift in connotation from simply describing a cat-like quality to emphasizing the negative aspects of that quality.
