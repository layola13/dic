词源:
The word "cauliflower" comes from the Old French "chou-fleur," literally meaning "cabbage flower."  The "chou" part comes from the Latin "caulis," meaning "stem" or "stalk," referring to the stem-like structure of the plant.  The "fleur" part is simply the French word for "flower," describing the edible flower head.  The word entered English in the 14th century.
