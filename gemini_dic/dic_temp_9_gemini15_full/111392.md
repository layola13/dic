词源:  The adverb "lividly" derives from the adjective "livid," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "lividus," meaning "black and blue," "lead-colored," or "pale."  The original sense referred to the bluish discoloration of skin due to a bruise. Over time, the word's meaning extended to describe intense anger, likely because the color of a bruise is associated with the flushed, angry appearance of someone's face.
