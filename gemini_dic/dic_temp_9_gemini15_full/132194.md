nondarker:/ˈnɒnˈdɑːrkər/ | adj. | 不再黑暗的；变亮的 |  Not darker; becoming lighter. This word is not a standard English word and lacks established dictionary entries. It's likely a newly coined word or a misspelling.  The meaning is inferred from its components: "non-" (not) and "darker" (comparative of dark).  |  The room, once nondarker, was now brightly lit. (This is an example using the invented word to illustrate the intended meaning.) | brighter, lighter | darker | adjective
