词源:  The word "pursy" ultimately derives from the Old French word "poursuivre," meaning "to pursue" or "to follow."  However, the connection isn't direct.  Over time, "poursuivre" gave rise to the Middle English word "purse," meaning "to breathe hard" or "to pant." This sense of "purse" is now obsolete, but it's the direct ancestor of the adjective "pursy."  The modern meaning evolved from the association of heavy breathing with obesity and shortness of breath.
