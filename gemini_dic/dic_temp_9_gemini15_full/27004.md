calculatednesses:/ˌkælkjʊˈleɪtɪdnəsɪz/| n. | 计算性；精打细算；深思熟虑 | The word "calculatednesses" is not a standard word in English. It's a rather unusual and artificially created word formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to "calculatedness," which itself is not a frequently used word.  It attempts to convey a plurality or multiplicity of calculated actions or qualities.  The meaning is derived from the base word "calculated," implying deliberate planning and consideration.  However, due to its unusual nature, the word might be misunderstood or considered awkward in most contexts.  There are better alternatives to express the intended meaning. |  The multiple instances of  careful planning revealed the company's intricate calculatednesses. (这句话略显笨拙，更好的表达方式是：The company's meticulous planning was evident in multiple instances.) |  deliberateness, premeditation, forethought |  impulsiveness, spontaneity, randomness | 名词
