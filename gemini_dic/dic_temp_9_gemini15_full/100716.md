疑问句:
What are the characteristics of intralobular lesions in this disease? = 这种疾病中小叶内病变的特征是什么？
Are there any differences in intralobular blood flow between healthy and diseased tissue? = 健康组织和患病组织之间的小叶内血流是否存在差异？


否定句:
There was no evidence of significant intralobular damage. = 没有证据表明有明显的小叶内损伤。
The study did not find any correlation between intralobular inflammation and disease severity. = 该研究没有发现小叶内炎症与疾病严重程度之间的任何相关性。


PHRASE->
intralobular inflammation 小叶内炎症
intralobular fibrosis 小叶内纤维化

intralobular cells 小叶内细胞


Note on Intralobular vs. Interlobular: While often used interchangeably,  "intralobular" refers to *within* a lobule, while "interlobular" refers to the *space between* lobules.  The subtle difference is important in precise anatomical descriptions.
