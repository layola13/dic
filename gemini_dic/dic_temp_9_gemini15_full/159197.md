词源:
The origin of "podunk" is uncertain, but it's believed to have emerged in the late 19th or early 20th century in American English.  Several theories exist, suggesting it might derive from Native American words, or perhaps a combination of words with similar sounds, ultimately evolving to describe uninteresting or insignificant places.  The exact etymology remains debated.
