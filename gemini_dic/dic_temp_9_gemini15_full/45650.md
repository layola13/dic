The word "curstest" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very niche or specialized vocabulary.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis as requested.  To help you, I need more context: where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the source might help determine its intended meaning and allow for a more accurate analysis.
