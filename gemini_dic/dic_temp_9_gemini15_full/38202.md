词源:

The word "compulsorily" derives from the adjective "compulsory," which in turn comes from the Latin word "compulsorius," meaning "driving together," "forcing."  The Latin root is "compellere," meaning "to drive together," "to force," "to compel." This reflects the meaning of the word, as something compulsory is something that is forced or required.
