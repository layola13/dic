foliation:/ˌfoʊliˈeɪʃən/| n. |叶理；页理；片理|The arrangement of mineral grains or structural features in a parallel or sub-parallel manner in metamorphic rocks. This layered structure is often caused by pressure and heat during metamorphism.  |The foliation in this metamorphic rock is clearly visible. 这块变质岩中的叶理清晰可见。|banding, layering, lamination|massive, homogeneous


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The foliation of this rock sample is quite complex. = 这块岩石样品的叶理相当复杂。
Foliation often indicates the direction of pressure during metamorphism. = 叶理通常表明变质作用期间压力的方向。


一般过去时:
Geologists studied the foliation patterns in the ancient rocks. = 地质学家研究了古代岩石中的叶理模式。
The intense pressure created strong foliation in the rock. = 巨大的压力在岩石中产生了强烈的叶理。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several types of foliation in this region. = 科学家们在这个地区已经确定了几种类型的叶理。
Researchers have observed that foliation can be affected by various factors. = 研究人员观察到叶理会受到各种因素的影响。


过去完成时:
Before the metamorphism, the rock lacked any foliation. = 在变质作用之前，岩石没有任何叶理。
The scientists had already determined that the foliation was caused by tectonic forces. = 科学家们已经确定叶理是由构造力造成的。


将来时:
Future studies will investigate the relationship between foliation and mineral composition. = 未来的研究将调查叶理与矿物成分之间的关系。
Geologists will analyze the foliation to understand the rock's history. = 地质学家将分析叶理以了解岩石的历史。


虚拟语气:
If the foliation were more pronounced, it would be easier to identify. = 如果叶理更明显，就更容易识别。
I wish I had understood the significance of foliation earlier. = 我真希望我早点明白叶理的重要性。


被动语态:
The foliation was analyzed using microscopic techniques. = 叶理是用显微技术分析的。
The rock's age is determined by analyzing its foliation. = 岩石的年龄是通过分析其叶理来确定的。


疑问句:
What type of foliation is present in this sample? = 这个样本中存在哪种类型的叶理？
How did the foliation form in this rock? = 这块岩石中的叶理是如何形成的？


否定句:
This rock does not exhibit any significant foliation. = 这块岩石没有表现出任何明显的叶理。
The sample showed no evidence of foliation. = 样本没有显示任何叶理的证据。


PHRASE->
planar foliation = 平面叶理
axial planar foliation = 轴面叶理
cleavage foliation = 解理叶理
foliation development = 叶理发育
foliation fabric = 叶理构造
