词源:

The word "kowtow" comes from the Cantonese word 叩頭 (kau tau), which literally translates to "knock head."  This refers to the traditional Chinese practice of showing deep respect by kneeling and touching one's forehead to the ground. The word entered English in the 19th century, reflecting the increased Western contact with China.
