The word "rejails" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure vocabulary.  To provide the requested analysis, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered "rejails."
