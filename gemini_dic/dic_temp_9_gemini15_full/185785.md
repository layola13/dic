词源:
The word "reviolates" is formed by adding the prefix "re-" to the verb "violates."  The prefix "re-" indicates repetition or doing something again.  "Violates" comes from the Latin word "violare," meaning "to profane," "to injure," or "to violate."  Therefore, "reviolates" implies a repeated or renewed act of violation.
