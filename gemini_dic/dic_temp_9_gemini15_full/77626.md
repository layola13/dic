/ˌdʒaɪtəˈnɒɡəmi/ | n. | 邻株异花传粉 | Geitonogamy refers to the transfer of pollen from the flower of one plant to the stigma of another flower on the same plant.  It is a form of self-pollination, but unlike autogamy (self-pollination within the same flower), it involves a pollinating agent such as wind or an insect. | Example:  Many species of plants utilize geitonogamy as a mechanism to ensure reproduction, especially in environments with limited pollinators.  邻株异花传粉是许多植物物种用来确保繁殖的一种机制，尤其是在传粉媒介有限的环境中。|近义词：self-pollination (but with a pollinating agent involved)|反义词：xenogamy (cross-pollination)
