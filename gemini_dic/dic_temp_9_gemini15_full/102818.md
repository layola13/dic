词源:
The word "jargon" ultimately derives from the Medieval Latin word "gargula," meaning "throat" or "gullet."  This evolved into Old French "gargouiller," meaning "to gurgle" or "to chatter," referring to unintelligible or nonsensical talk.  Over time, the spelling shifted and the meaning specialized to refer to the specialized language of a particular group.
