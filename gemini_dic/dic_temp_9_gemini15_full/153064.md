词源:
The word "peering" comes from the Middle English word "pieren," meaning "to peep or peer," which in turn has roots in the Old French word "pirier," meaning "to peep or look through a small opening."  The ultimate origin is uncertain but may be related to words suggesting looking through a small hole or opening.
