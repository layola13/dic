词源:

From Latin *canicularis, from canicula ("little dog"), the name given to the star Sirius, which rises heliacally in summer.  The association with heat comes from the perceived increased heat during the time Sirius is visible.

英文解析:

The word "canicular" is primarily used to describe the hottest part of the summer, often referred to as the "dog days." This is because the ancient Greeks and Romans associated the heat of this period with the heliacal rising of Sirius, the Dog Star.  The word can also refer to things related to Sirius itself, though this usage is far less common.
