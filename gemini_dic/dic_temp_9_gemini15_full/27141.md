词源:

The word "calking" comes from the Middle English word *caulkien*, which itself is derived from the Old Norse word *kalk*.  This ultimately relates to the Old English word *cealc*, meaning "chalk" or "lime," reflecting the traditional use of these materials for sealing.  The shift in meaning from the material used to the act of sealing is a common semantic development.
