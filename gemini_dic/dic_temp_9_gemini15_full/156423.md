phytomer:/ˈfaɪtəʊmər/| n. |植物节|A phytomer is a repeating unit in the plant's architecture, consisting of a node, an internode, a leaf (or leaves), and a bud.  It represents a basic module of plant growth and development.  Phytomers are formed sequentially during plant development, leading to the overall structure of the plant. |The maize plant exhibits a clear arrangement of phytomers along its stem.|近义词:plant module, repeating unit|反义词:None

将来时:
Scientists will further investigate the role of phytomers in plant architecture. = 科学家们将进一步研究植物节在植物结构中的作用。
The research team will analyze the genetic basis of phytomer development next year. = 研究小组将在明年分析植物节发育的遗传基础。


虚拟语气:
If the phytomers were damaged, the plant's growth would be affected. = 如果植物节受损，植物的生长就会受到影响。
