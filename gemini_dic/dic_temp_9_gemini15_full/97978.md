inoceramus: /ɪˌnɒsɪˈræməs/ | n. | 菊石类双壳贝 |  Inoceramus is an extinct genus of large, thick-shelled bivalve mollusks that lived during the Mesozoic Era.  They are characterized by their large size, often exceeding a meter in length, and their generally irregular, often inflated, shells.  They were abundant in many marine environments and are important index fossils for dating Mesozoic rocks. |  Example: The discovery of Inoceramus fossils helped geologists date the rock layers to the Cretaceous period.  = 菊石类双壳贝化石的发现帮助地质学家将岩层年代确定为白垩纪。


近义词:  (No perfect synonyms, as it's an extinct genus.  Related terms might include:)  bivalve, mollusk, shell
