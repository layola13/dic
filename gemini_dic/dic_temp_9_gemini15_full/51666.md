/dɪˈvaɪsfʊlnəsɪz/ | n. |  巧妙的装置；精巧的设计；策略；手段的复数形式 | The word "devicefulnesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a non-standard pluralization of "devicefulness," which itself is not a commonly used word.  It's likely an attempt to create a word to express multiple instances of cleverness or ingenuity in the use of devices or strategies.  The meaning would be derived from the combination of "device" (a mechanism or plan) and "fulness" (the state of being full of something). Therefore, the intended meaning would be multiple instances of cleverness or ingenuity in using devices or strategies. |  There are no standard examples as this is not a real word.  One could construct an example based on the intended meaning, for example: "The general's many devicefulnesses secured victory." (meaning: The general's many clever strategies secured victory.) |  ingeniousness, cleverness, resourcefulness, cunning |  clumsiness, ineptitude | noun
