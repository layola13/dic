ependyma: /ɪˈpɛndɪmə/ | n. | 室管膜 |

英文解析: Ependyma is a thin membrane that lines the ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord.  It is composed of specialized epithelial cells called ependymal cells, which are involved in the production and circulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  The ependyma plays a crucial role in maintaining the homeostasis of the central nervous system.


例句:

The ependyma of the lateral ventricles was examined for signs of inflammation.  侧脑室的室管膜被检查是否有炎症迹象。

Damage to the ependyma can disrupt the flow of cerebrospinal fluid. 室管膜受损会扰乱脑脊液的流动。


近义词:  choroid plexus (partially, as it relates to CSF production)


反义词:  There isn't a direct antonym, as ependyma refers to a specific anatomical structure.


词性: Noun


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The ependyma lines the ventricles. = 室管膜衬里脑室。
Ependymal cells produce cerebrospinal fluid. = 室管膜细胞产生脑脊液。


一般过去时:
Researchers studied the ependyma's role in CSF flow. = 研究人员研究了室管膜在脑脊液流动中的作用。
The damaged ependyma was repaired. = 受损的室管膜得到了修复。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered new functions of the ependyma. = 科学家们已经发现了室管膜的新功能。
The study has shown the importance of the ependyma's integrity. = 该研究表明了室管膜完整性的重要性。


过去完成时:
Before the injury, the ependyma was healthy. = 受伤前，室管膜是健康的。
They had already examined the ependyma before the surgery. = 他们已经在手术前检查了室管膜。


将来时:
We will analyze the ependyma using advanced microscopy. = 我们将使用先进的显微镜分析室管膜。
The researchers will investigate the ependyma's response to injury. = 研究人员将调查室管膜对损伤的反应。


虚拟语气:
If the ependyma were damaged, the CSF flow would be affected. = 如果室管膜受损，脑脊液流动就会受到影响。
It is crucial that the ependyma remains intact. = 室管膜保持完整至关重要。


被动语态:
The ependyma was carefully examined under a microscope. = 室管膜在显微镜下被仔细检查。
The function of the ependyma is being studied extensively. = 室管膜的功能正在被广泛研究。


疑问句:
What is the function of the ependyma? = 室管膜的功能是什么？
How does the ependyma contribute to CSF circulation? = 室管膜如何促进脑脊液循环？


否定句:
The ependyma was not damaged in the accident. = 室管膜在事故中没有受损。
The study did not find any abnormalities in the ependyma. = 该研究没有发现室管膜有任何异常。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "ependyma" as it is a highly specialized anatomical term.  Phrases would typically involve descriptive terms related to its function or location, for example:  "ependymal cell layer", "ventricular ependyma", "ependymal lining", "ependymal damage", "ependymal cells function".
