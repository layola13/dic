semi-vitrified: /ˈsɛmiˈvɪtrɪfaɪd/ | adj. | 半石化的；半瓷化的 | Partially vitrified; having undergone partial vitrification.  This term usually refers to ceramics or clay products that have been fired at a temperature lower than that required for complete vitrification, resulting in a material that is somewhere between a porous earthenware and a fully vitrified porcelain.  It possesses some of the properties of both, offering a balance of strength and porosity. |
