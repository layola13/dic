词源:
The word "replying" comes from the Old French word "repleier," meaning "to reply, answer, respond".  This word itself has roots in the Latin prefix "re-" (again) and the verb "plegiare" (to pledge, guarantee, or engage in a surety).  Over time, "repleier" evolved into the Middle English "replien" and eventually into the modern English "reply," with "-ing" added to form the present participle.
