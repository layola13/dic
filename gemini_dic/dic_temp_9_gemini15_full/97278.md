词源:
The word "influencive" is derived from the verb "influence," which comes from the Old French word "influencier," meaning "to flow into."  This in turn is derived from the Latin "influentia," meaning "influence," from "influere," meaning "to flow in."  The suffix "-ive" is added to create the adjective form, indicating "having the nature of."
