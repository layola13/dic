pantochronometer:/ˌpæntəʊkrɒˈnɒmɪtə(r)/| n. |万花筒计时器，全景计时器 |A pantochronometer is a hypothetical device or concept that would allow one to view all moments of time simultaneously.  It's often used in science fiction to depict a device capable of showing the past, present, and future at once.  The term combines "pan-" (all, every)  "chrono-" (time) and "-meter" (measuring instrument).  It does not refer to a real, existing device. |The scientist theorized about the possibilities of a pantochronometer to observe the entire history of the universe.  科学家设想了一个万花筒计时器来观察宇宙的整个历史。|近义词：chronometer (but lacks the 'all-encompassing' aspect)|反义词：None (as it's a hypothetical concept)
