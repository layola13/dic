词源：

The word originates from the Latin word "prodigiosus," meaning "monstrous," "wonderful," or "marvelous."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "prodigious" into a noun, signifying the quality or state of being prodigious.  The addition of "-es" creates the plural form.


用法说明：

"Prodigiousnesses" is a relatively uncommon word.  It is used to emphasize the multiplicity of extraordinary feats, abilities, or qualities.  It is best used in contexts where multiple instances of prodigiousness are being highlighted.  A more common alternative would be simply to use the word "prodigious" multiple times, or to use phrases like "many amazing feats" or "numerous exceptional talents."  The word's rarity makes it suitable for more formal or literary contexts.  It is less likely to be found in everyday conversation.
