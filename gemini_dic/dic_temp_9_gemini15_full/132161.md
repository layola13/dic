词源:
The word "noncurrent" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "current" (meaning "happening or existing now").  The term's use in accounting and finance derives from the distinction between assets readily convertible to cash (current assets) and those not easily liquidated (noncurrent assets).
