词源:

The word is a compound of "half" and "educated."  "Half" indicates incompleteness or partiality, while "educated" refers to the process of receiving formal instruction and acquiring knowledge.  The combination thus signifies someone who has received some education but not enough to be considered fully knowledgeable or skilled.


用法说明:

This adjective is primarily used to describe a person who has some education but lacks a deep understanding or comprehensive knowledge in a particular field or generally. It often carries a slightly negative connotation, implying a lack of thoroughness or competence.  It is not typically used as a complimentary term.  The term is usually applied to people, but can sometimes be used metaphorically about ideas or approaches.
