词源:
The word "connectability" is derived from the verb "connect" and the suffix "-ability," which indicates capacity or potential.  "Connect" itself has roots in the Latin word "con," meaning "together," and "nectere," meaning "to bind" or "to tie."  Therefore, "connectability" ultimately refers to the potential for things to be bound or tied together.
