laminapropria: /ˌlæmɪnəˈproʊpriə/ | n. |固有层|The lamina propria is a thin layer of connective tissue that underlies the epithelium in many organs.  It provides structural support and contains blood vessels, nerves, and immune cells.  The specific composition and function of the lamina propria vary depending on the organ. For example, in the gastrointestinal tract, the lamina propria contains immune cells that help protect against pathogens. |The lamina propria of the gut is rich in immune cells.|近义词：connective tissue layer, submucosa (in some contexts)|反义词：epithelium

词源:

* **lamina:**  From Latin, meaning "thin plate" or "layer."
* **propria:** From Latin, meaning "one's own" or "proper."  In this context, it refers to the layer that is characteristic or proper to the organ.

Therefore, "laminapropria" literally translates to "one's own layer" or "proper layer," referring to the characteristic connective tissue layer underlying the epithelium.
