词源:  The word "racialistic" is derived from the noun "race" and the suffix "-istic," which means "characterized by" or "relating to."  The concept of race itself has a complex and contested history, evolving over time and influenced by social and political factors.  The term emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as discussions about race and racial inequality intensified.  The "-istic" suffix is a common way to form adjectives, indicating a characteristic or quality of something.
