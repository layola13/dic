词源:
The word "eavesdropping" originates from the Old English words "efese" (eaves of a house) and "droppen" (to drip or fall).  Originally, it referred to the act of secretly listening from under the eaves of a house, where a person might be hidden from view.  Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass any form of secret listening.
