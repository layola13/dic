cowcatchers:/ˈkaʊˌkætʃərz/| n. |火车头防撞器|A cowcatcher is a metal structure attached to the front of a locomotive or train to clear obstructions from the tracks, such as livestock (hence the name).  It's designed to push aside or deflect obstacles rather than directly collide with them, minimizing damage to the train and preventing derailment. |The train's cowcatcher plowed through the fallen tree without incident.|近义词：pilot plow, snowplow (in certain contexts)|反义词：None specifically, but the opposite function would be something that *causes* derailment.
