The word "Reagansborg" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism, likely a made-up name or a proper noun, possibly combining elements referencing Ronald Reagan and a place name ending in "-borg" (common in Scandinavian place names).  Therefore, a detailed analysis in the requested format is impossible.
