dimorphism:/daɪˈmɔːrfɪzəm/| n. |二态性；二形性；双形现象|The existence of two distinct forms of an organism, especially in different sexes.  It refers to the condition where two distinct forms of individuals exist within the same species. This difference can be in size, shape, color, or other characteristics.  The most common example is sexual dimorphism, where males and females of the same species differ significantly in appearance.| Example:  Sexual dimorphism is evident in many bird species, where males are often more brightly colored than females.  雄性鸟类通常比雌性鸟类颜色鲜艳，这在许多鸟类物种中很明显。  Another example is the dimorphism seen in some plants, where they exhibit two different forms of flowers.|近义词：polymorphism, duality|反义词：monomorphism
