词源:  The word "haughty" ultimately derives from the Old Norse word *háugr*, meaning "heap" or "hill."  This is linked to the idea of being "high" or elevated, both physically and socially.  Over time, the sense shifted to describe someone who acts as if they are superior because of their elevated social position or perceived importance.  The word entered Middle English as *hauti*, eventually evolving into its modern form.
