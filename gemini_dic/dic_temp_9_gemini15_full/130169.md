词源:
The word "non-revenue" is a compound word.  "Non-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of," derived from Old French "non." "Revenue" comes from Old French "revenu," ultimately from Latin "revenire," meaning "to return" (referring to income returning to the owner).  Therefore, "non-revenue" literally means "not returning income."
