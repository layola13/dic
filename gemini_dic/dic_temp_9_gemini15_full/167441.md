prevariation:/ˌpriːˌveəriˈeɪʃən/ | n. | 预先变化；前期变化 | A prevariation is a change or variation that occurs before something else.

The prevariations in the geological strata indicated a significant upcoming climatic change. |近义词: preliminary change, antecedent variation, prior alteration | 反义词: postvariation, subsequent change
