词源:  Derived from the verb "distill," which itself comes from the Middle English word "distillen," ultimately from the Late Latin "distillare," a combination of "dis-" (apart) and "stillare" (to drop).  The meaning reflects the process of separating components of a liquid by vaporization and condensation.
