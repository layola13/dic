His nonfervent response to the good news was disappointing. 他对好消息的冷淡回应令人失望。|近义词：apathetic, lukewarm, unenthusiastic, indifferent, tepid |反义词：fervent, passionate, enthusiastic, zealous, ardent

词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "fervent," which derives from the Latin word "fervens," the present participle of "fervere," meaning "to boil," "to glow," or "to be hot."  Therefore, "nonfervent" literally means "not boiling," "not glowing," or "not hot" in terms of feeling or enthusiasm.
