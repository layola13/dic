pseudopupa:/ˌsuːdəʊˈpjuːpə/| n. |拟蛹|A pseudopupa is a resting stage in the life cycle of some insects, particularly in certain Diptera (flies) and Hymenoptera (wasps, bees, ants), that resembles a pupa but lacks the complete morphological and physiological changes associated with true pupation.  It's essentially a non-feeding, quiescent stage that bridges the larval and adult stages, but without the dramatic reorganization of tissues characteristic of a true pupa. |Example:  The larva of this species enters a pseudopupal stage before transforming into an adult.  这种物种的幼虫在变成成虫之前会进入拟蛹期。|近义词:resting stage, quiescent stage |反义词:pupa
