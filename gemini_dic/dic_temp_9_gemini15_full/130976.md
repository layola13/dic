词源:

The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adverb "astringently."  "Astringently" derives from the adjective "astringent," which comes from the Latin word "astringere," meaning "to bind or draw together."  Astringent substances cause contraction or tightening, often associated with a harsh or drying effect.  Therefore, "nonastringently" means "not in a way that binds, contracts, or dries harshly."
