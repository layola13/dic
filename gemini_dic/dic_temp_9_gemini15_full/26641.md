词源:  The word "cacodoxical" is derived from Greek roots:  "kakos" (κακός) meaning "bad," "ill," or "evil," and "doxa" (δόξα) meaning "opinion," "belief," or "glory."  The suffix "-ical" denotes "relating to" or "having the nature of."  Therefore, "cacodoxical" literally means "relating to bad opinion" or "characterized by a faulty or wrong belief."  Its use, however, has shifted to emphasize the inherent contradiction or absurdity of the belief itself.
