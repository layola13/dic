词源:
The origin is uncertain, but it's believed to be a reduplication of "dilly," a word of uncertain origin that itself may be related to "dally," meaning "to waste time."  The "dilly" part might be associated with words suggesting slowness or foolishness. The repetition intensifies the sense of delay and procrastination.
