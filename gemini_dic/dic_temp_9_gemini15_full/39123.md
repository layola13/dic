WORD ORIGIN->

The word "confusabilities" is derived from the verb "confuse," ultimately originating from the Latin word "confundere," meaning "to pour together," "to mix up," or "to throw into disorder."  The suffix "-able" transforms the verb into an adjective meaning "capable of being confused," and the further suffix "-ities" forms a plural noun denoting instances or qualities of being confusable.
