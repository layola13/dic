The word "levet" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling of another word.  If you could provide the intended word or context, I can assist.
* It's a very rare or obsolete word.
* It's a word from a specific dialect or jargon.
* It's a newly coined word.

Please clarify the word or provide more context.
