/ˈpræktɪkələr/ | adj. | 更实际的，更实用的 | More practical; possessing a higher degree of practicality.  This word is less common and often considered non-standard.  It's formed by adding the comparative suffix "-er" to "practical," but it sounds awkward to many native speakers.  A better alternative is to use "more practical." | The newer design is practicaler than the old one. = 新的设计比旧的设计更实用。  His approach to the problem is practicaler than hers. = 他解决问题的方法比她更实用。 | more practical, useful | impractical, theoretical | adj.
