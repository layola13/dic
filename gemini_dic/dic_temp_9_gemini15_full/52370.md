The word "dictionalrian" is not a recognized word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It seems to be a possible misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need a correctly spelled word.
