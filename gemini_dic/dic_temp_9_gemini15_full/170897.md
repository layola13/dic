用法说明:

The term "pseudologist" is less common than "liar" or "imposter", but it carries a stronger connotation of intellectual dishonesty. It suggests a deliberate and often skillful construction of falsehoods, often presented with an air of authority or expertise.  It is less focused on simple lies and more on the creation of elaborate deceptions, often involving the manipulation of facts or the invention of information.  It's often used in contexts where the deception involves a claim of knowledge or expertise.
