pro-anaphoral: /ˌproʊænəˈfɔːrəl/ | adj. | 前指的，先行词的 |  Describing a linguistic element (typically a pronoun) that refers back to a preceding element in the discourse (its antecedent) that is explicitly mentioned.  This is in contrast to anaphora, where the antecedent may be implicit or understood from context. Pro-anaphoral highlights the explicit, preceding nature of the reference. |  The pronoun "he" in the sentence "John went to the store; he bought milk" is pro-anaphoral because it explicitly refers to the previously mentioned "John". | 近义词:anaphoric (but with stronger emphasis on the explicit preceding reference)| 反义词: cataphoric (referring forward),  deictic (referring to context outside the sentence) |


词源:

* **pro-**:  prefix meaning "before," "forward," or "in favor of."
* **anaphora**: from Greek *anaphora*  (αναφορά), meaning "carrying back," referring to the grammatical phenomenon where a word or phrase refers back to a previously mentioned entity.


用法说明:

Pro-anaphoral is primarily used in linguistic analysis, particularly in the study of anaphora and discourse processing. It's a more specific term than simply "anaphoric," emphasizing the explicit and preceding nature of the reference.  It is not commonly used in everyday conversation.  The term helps to clarify the relationship between a pronoun or other referring expression and its antecedent, particularly in cases where the antecedent is clearly stated before the pro-anaphoral element.


例句:

The sentence "The dog barked; it was loud" contains a pro-anaphoral pronoun ("it") referring back to the explicitly mentioned "dog." =  句子“狗叫了；它声音很大”包含一个前指代词（“it”），指的是前面明确提到的“狗”。


The phrase "Mary arrived late; she apologized" displays pro-anaphoral reference, with "she" clearly linked to "Mary". = 短语“玛丽迟到了；她道歉了”显示了前指的引用，“她”与“玛丽”清楚地联系在一起。

There is no USAGE, PHRASE section for this word as it's a highly technical term not used in common phrases or sentence structures outside of linguistic analysis.
