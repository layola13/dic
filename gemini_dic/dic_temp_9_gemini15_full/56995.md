词源:The term "double-edged" originates from the image of a double-edged sword, a sword with a sharp edge on both sides.  The metaphorical extension to situations with both positive and negative aspects emerged later.  The "double" part indicates the duality, while "edged" refers to the sharp, impactful nature of the consequences.
