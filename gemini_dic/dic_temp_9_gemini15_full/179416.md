词源:
The word "reduce" comes from the Old French word "reduire," which in turn comes from the Latin word "reducere," meaning "to lead back."  The prefix "re-" means "back" or "again," and "ducere" means "to lead."  Therefore, the original meaning implied leading something back to a previous state or a smaller form.
