词源:  The word "shrewd" originates from the Old English word "scrūdan," meaning "to cut, to shear."  This connection is somewhat indirect. The original meaning likely referred to someone who was quick and efficient in their actions, like someone who skillfully shears sheep. Over time, the meaning evolved to describe someone who is mentally sharp and quick-witted, capable of making astute judgments.  The link to "shrew" (a small, aggressive animal) is coincidental and only a later association.
