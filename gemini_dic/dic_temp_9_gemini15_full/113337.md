From Latin *luxuriāns, present participle of luxuriārī "to grow luxuriantly," from luxuria "excess, abundance," from lux "light."  The original sense referred to the abundant growth of plants in sunlight.  The meaning has broadened to include abundance in other contexts, including wealth and richness.
