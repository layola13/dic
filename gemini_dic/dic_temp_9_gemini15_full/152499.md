词源:
The word "paymaster" is a compound word formed from "pay" and "master".  "Pay" comes from Old French "payer," meaning "to satisfy, appease, pay," ultimately from Vulgar Latin *pacāre, "to pacify, appease."  "Master" derives from Old French "maistre," from Latin "magister," meaning "teacher, master."  Therefore, a "paymaster" literally means the "master of pay" or the one who controls the payment process.
