词源:
From "kitsch," ultimately from German, possibly of Bohemian origin.  The exact etymology is uncertain, but it's believed to be related to the German word "kitzen," meaning to tickle or to excite.  It originally referred to cheap, mass-produced art considered to have little artistic merit but often appealing to popular taste.  The adverbial form "-ily" is a standard English suffix.
