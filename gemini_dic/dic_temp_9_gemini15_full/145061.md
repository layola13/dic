The word "overambitiousnesses" is a noun.  It's a rather uncommon and somewhat unwieldy word, formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to the adjective "overambitious." Let's break it down:


* **over-**:  Prefix meaning "too much," "excessive," or "beyond."

* **ambitious**: Adjective meaning having or showing a strong desire and determination to succeed.  Its root is from the Old French "ambicieux," ultimately deriving from the Latin "ambitio," meaning "going around," "a canvassing for votes," and later evolving to mean "ambition."

* **-ness**: Suffix forming nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.  For example, "goodness," "kindness," "sadness."

* **-es**: Plural suffix indicating more than one instance of overambitiousness.


Therefore, "overambitiousnesses" refers to multiple instances or manifestations of excessive ambition or the pursuit of unrealistic goals.  It suggests a collection of overly ambitious plans, projects, or endeavors.



The word is rarely used in everyday conversation and would generally be replaced by more concise phrasing like "excessive ambitions," "unrealistic goals," or "overambitious projects."



Because of its rarity, providing detailed examples of its usage across various grammatical tenses is impractical. The grammatical functions would follow standard noun usage rules.  For example:


* **Simple Present:**  His overambitiousnesses are evident in his grandiose plans. (他的过分雄心勃勃在他宏伟的计划中显而易见。)

* **Simple Past:** Her overambitiousnesses ultimately led to her burnout. (她的过分雄心勃勃最终导致她筋疲力尽。)

* **Present Perfect:** The company's overambitiousnesses have finally caught up with them. (公司的过分雄心勃勃最终还是给他们带来了麻烦。)

* **Future Simple:** His future overambitiousnesses will likely cause him more problems. (他未来的过分雄心勃勃很可能会给他带来更多麻烦。)
