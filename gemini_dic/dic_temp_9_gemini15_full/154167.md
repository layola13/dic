period-of-rotation: /ˈpɪəriəd əv roʊˈteɪʃən/ | n. |自转周期，旋转周期 | The time it takes for an object to complete one full rotation on its axis.  This term is commonly used in astronomy and physics to describe the time it takes for planets, stars, or other celestial bodies to spin once on their axis.  It can also refer to the rotational period of any rotating object. | Example: The Earth's period of rotation is approximately 24 hours. 地球的自转周期大约是24小时。 The period of rotation of a spinning top gradually decreases as friction slows it down.  旋转陀螺的自转周期随着摩擦力的减小而逐渐减慢。| 近义词：rotational period, spin period | 反义词：N/A (no direct antonym, but the concept of a "lack of rotation" could be considered an opposite) | 名词
