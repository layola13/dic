词源:
The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively) and "exacting" (meaning demanding).  "Exacting" itself comes from the verb "exact," meaning to demand something forcefully or strictly, which in turn has roots in the Latin word "exigere," meaning "to drive out," "to demand," or "to require."
