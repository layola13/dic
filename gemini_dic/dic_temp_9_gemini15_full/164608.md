词源:  The word is formed from "pre-" (before) + "exemption" (the act of freeing from an obligation or liability).  The "exemption" part comes from the Latin "exemtio," meaning "a taking out," from "eximere," meaning "to take out," composed of "ex" (out) and "emere" (to take).  Therefore, preemption implies a taking out or securing of a right *before* others.
