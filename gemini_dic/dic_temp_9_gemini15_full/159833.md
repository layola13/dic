polyhaploid:/ˈpɒliˌhæplɔɪd/| adj.|多单倍体|A polyhaploid is a type of organism or cell that has multiple sets of chromosomes, but each set is derived from a single parent.  This differs from a polyploid, which has multiple sets of chromosomes from multiple parents. Polyhaploids are often generated through processes like chromosome doubling in haploid cells or through interspecific hybridization followed by chromosome elimination.|Example:  Researchers used polyhaploid lines to improve the yield of wheat.  研究人员利用多单倍体品系来提高小麦的产量。|近义词：haploid (if referring to the single parent origin), monoploid (if referring to the single parent origin)|反义词：polyploid (if multiple parental origins are considered)
