词源:  From Late Latin *feculentus, from Latin fex, fec- "dregs, sediment, lees".  The word ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *peh₂- "to clean, purify", which is ironic given the word's modern meaning.  The shift in meaning likely occurred due to the association of dregs and sediment with filth and unpleasant smells.
