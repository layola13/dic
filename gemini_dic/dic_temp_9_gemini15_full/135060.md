USAGE->
This word is extremely rare and doesn't have common usage examples across different tenses like "what".  It's primarily used in its base form to describe a collection of unimportant things.  Grammatical examples across tenses are therefore impractical and unnatural.  The following illustrates its basic usage:

PHRASE->
Because of the word's rarity, common phrases are not readily available. The word itself functions more as a descriptive noun than a part of common phrases.  The following illustrates potential usage within phrases.


a series of nonnotablenesses = 一系列不值得注意的事情
a collection of nonnotablenesses = 一堆不重要的事情
a multitude of nonnotablenesses = 大量的不值得注意的事情
the accumulation of nonnotablenesses = 不值得注意的事情的积累
a flurry of nonnotablenesses = 一连串不重要的小事


词源:

The word is formed from "non-" (not) + "notable" (worthy of notice) + "-ness" (state or quality).  Therefore, it literally means "the state of being not notable."  The plural "-nesses" is added to indicate multiple instances of this state or quality.
