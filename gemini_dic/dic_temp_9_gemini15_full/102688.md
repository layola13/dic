词源:
The word "jammable" is derived from the verb "jam," meaning to obstruct or interfere with the functioning of something, particularly electronic equipment.  The "-able" suffix indicates capability or susceptibility.  The origin of "jam" in this context is likely related to its earlier meaning of "to press or squeeze tightly," suggesting the blockage or compression of a signal.
