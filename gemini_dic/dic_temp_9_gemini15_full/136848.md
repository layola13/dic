一般现在时:
The system does not nonsimulate the real-world conditions. = 该系统不模拟真实世界条件。(This sentence is awkward because "nonsimulate" is rarely used as a verb.  A better phrasing would be "The system does not simulate...")
Nonsimulate materials are often more expensive. = 非模拟材料通常更贵。


一般过去时:
The experiment used nonsimulate samples. = 实验使用了非模拟样本。
The presentation showed nonsimulate results. = 演示展示了真实的结果。(Again, "nonsimulate" is less common here; "real" or "actual" would be preferred).


现在完成时:

被动语态:
