词源:  The word "deadhearted" is a compound word formed from "dead" and "hearted."  "Dead" here means devoid of feeling or life, and "hearted" refers to the heart, the seat of emotions.  Thus, "deadhearted" literally means having a "dead heart," implying a lack of emotion or compassion.  The word's origins trace back to the general understanding of the heart as the center of emotions in English and other languages.  The construction is similar to other descriptive compounds in English.
