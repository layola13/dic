premodels:/ˈpriːmɒdəlz/ | n. |预模型，预训练模型 |A premodel is a model that has been pre-trained on a large dataset before being fine-tuned for a specific task.  They are often used in machine learning to improve performance and reduce training time.  |Example:  Researchers used premodels to accelerate the training of their new image recognition system.  研究人员使用预训练模型来加速其新的图像识别系统的训练。|近义词: pretrained models, base models |反义词:  newly trained models
