词源:
The verb "palm" in this context originates from the act of secretly placing something into someone's hand, often deceptively.  The "off" indicates the transfer or disposal of the item. The phrase evolved from the physical act of palming something to a more metaphorical meaning of deceptively passing off something as genuine or superior.
