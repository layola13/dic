词源:
The word "chum" ultimately derives from the Old English word "ceomp," meaning "merchant" or "trader."  Over time, its meaning shifted, possibly through a slang association with shared meals and company amongst merchants or sailors, eventually settling on its current meaning of a close friend or companion.  The evolution of its meaning is not completely clear but reflects a semantic drift from commercial association to social connection.
