redifferentiates: /ˌriːˌdɪfəˈrɛnʃieɪts/ | v. | 再分化；重新分化 | To undergo differentiation again; to differentiate a second time.  The process involves the reversion of a differentiated cell to a less specialized state, followed by differentiation into a different cell type. |

例句：

Stem cells redifferentiate into various specialized cell types.  | 幹細胞重新分化成各種特化的細胞類型。

The damaged tissue redifferentiates to repair itself. | 受損組織重新分化以修復自身。


近义词：regenerates, transforms, metamorphoses

反义词：specializes (in a specific way that prevents redifferentiation)
