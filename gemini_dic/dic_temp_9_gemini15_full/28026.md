capacitance:/kəˈpæsɪtəns/|/kəˈpæsɪtəns/| n. |电容|The ability of a system to store an electric charge.  It is the ratio of the change in electric charge to the corresponding change in electric potential.  The unit of capacitance is the farad (F).|The capacitor has a capacitance of 10 microfarads.|近义词：capacity (in a broader sense)|反义词：None directly applicable.  Could be considered the opposite of a perfect conductor, which would have zero capacitance.
