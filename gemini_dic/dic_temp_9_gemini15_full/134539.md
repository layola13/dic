nonlinearities:/ˌnɒnˌlɪniˈærɪtiz/ | n. |非线性；非线性现象 |The study of nonlinearities is crucial in many fields, from physics to economics.  非线性现象的研究在许多领域都至关重要，从物理学到经济学。|近义词：nonlinearity, curvatures |反义词：linearities


例句：

The model accounts for nonlinearities in the data.  该模型考虑了数据中的非线性因素。

Understanding these nonlinearities is key to predicting the system's behavior.  理解这些非线性现象是预测系统行为的关键。


英文解析：

Nonlinearities refer to phenomena or systems that do not exhibit a linear relationship between cause and effect.  In a linear system, a change in input proportionally affects the output. In contrast, nonlinear systems show disproportionate responses to changes in input, often exhibiting complex and unpredictable behavior.


词源:

* **non-**:  prefix meaning "not"
* **linear**:  from Latin *linearis*, from *linea* "line"
* **-ity**: suffix forming nouns of state or quality


USAGE->
由于nonlinearities是名词，所以不适用各种时态变化。  以下列举名词的用法示例：


单数：The nonlinearity of the system was unexpected. 系统的非线性特性出乎意料。

复数：The model incorporates several nonlinearities.  该模型包含几种非线性因素。

所有格：The nonlinearities' impact on the results was significant. 非线性因素对结果的影响是显著的。


PHRASE->

* system nonlinearities: 系统非线性
* inherent nonlinearities:  固有非线性
* significant nonlinearities:  显著的非线性
* modeling nonlinearities:  非线性建模
* effects of nonlinearities: 非线性效应
