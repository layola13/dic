The word "noty" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis following the requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, an abbreviation, or a word from a niche field or dialect.  If you could provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
