promyelocyte:/ˌproʊˈmaɪəloʊsaɪt/| n. |早幼粒细胞|A promyelocyte is an immature type of white blood cell that is a precursor to a myelocyte. It is characterized by the presence of primary (azurophilic) granules in its cytoplasm.  Promyelocytes are part of the myeloid lineage of hematopoiesis, the process of blood cell formation. They are relatively rare in normal blood samples.|Example: The bone marrow aspirate revealed an increased number of promyelocytes, suggesting a possible myeloid leukemia.|近义词: myeloblast (less mature)|反义词: mature granulocyte|词性:名词
