The word "nonreverences" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  However, we can analyze its potential meaning and structure:


It seems to be constructed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "reverences" (plural of reverence).  "Reverence" means deep respect, awe, or admiration.


Therefore, "nonreverences" could hypothetically mean:


* **Lack of reverence:**  The absence of respect, awe, or admiration.  This is the most likely interpretation.
* **Things that are not worthy of reverence:** Objects or concepts that do not deserve respect or admiration.


To provide an analysis as requested, we would need a valid word.  If you meant a different word, or if this is a word from a specific context (like a fictional work), please provide more information.
