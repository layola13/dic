词源:
The word "despondent" comes from the Old French word "despondre," which means "to lose courage" or "to despair."  It ultimately derives from the Latin "de-" (down, away from) and "spondere" (to promise, pledge, guarantee). The sense of losing hope and faith in a promise or expectation is inherent in its etymology.
