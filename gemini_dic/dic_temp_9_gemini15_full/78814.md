The word "gimcrack" likely originated in the 17th century.  Its etymology is uncertain, but it's generally believed to be a combination of  "gim" (possibly from "gimlet," a small tool suggesting something insignificant) and "crack," implying something fragile or easily broken.  The meaning evolved to encompass not just fragility but also worthlessness and superficial attractiveness.
