词源:The origin is uncertain, but it likely combines "cock" (a rooster) and "hoop" (a ring or circle), possibly suggesting a rooster crowing triumphantly in a circle, representing exuberant energy and excitement.  The phrase's development likely involved a gradual shift in meaning from a more literal description to its current figurative usage.
