pseudostratification:/ˌsuːdəʊˌstrætɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/ | n. |假复层|The appearance of stratification in a tissue, but with all cells actually in contact with the basement membrane.  This is in contrast to true stratification, where some cells are not in contact with the basement membrane.| 例句：The respiratory epithelium is characterized by pseudostratification, giving the illusion of multiple layers of cells.  呼吸道上皮的特点是假复层，给人以多层细胞的错觉。

The cells in pseudostratified epithelium appear to be arranged in layers, but in reality, all the cells touch the basement membrane.  假复层上皮中的细胞似乎排列成层，但实际上，所有细胞都接触基底膜。|近义词：apparent stratification, false stratification |反义词：stratification (true), simple epithelium


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Pseudostratified epithelium lines the trachea. = 假复层上皮排列在气管内。
The microscope reveals the pseudostratification of this tissue sample. = 显微镜揭示了这个组织样本的假复层结构。


一般过去时:
Scientists previously misidentified this tissue as stratified. = 科学家先前错误地将该组织识别为复层组织。
The study confirmed the pseudostratification of the cells. = 研究证实了细胞的假复层结构。


现在完成时:
Researchers have observed pseudostratification in various tissues. = 研究人员在各种组织中观察到假复层结构。
The textbook has explained pseudostratification clearly. = 教材已经清楚地解释了假复层结构。


过去完成时:
Before the invention of the microscope, pseudostratification was often misunderstood. = 在显微镜发明之前，人们常常误解假复层结构。
They had already known about the pseudostratification before starting the experiment. = 他们在开始实验之前就已经了解了假复层结构。


将来时:
Further research will clarify the functions of pseudostratified epithelium. = 进一步的研究将阐明假复层上皮的功能。
We will use advanced microscopy to study pseudostratification. = 我们将使用先进的显微镜来研究假复层结构。


虚拟语气:
If this were a truly stratified epithelium, it would look different. = 如果这是真正的复层上皮，它看起来会不一样。
It is as if the cells are stratified, but they aren't.  = 它看起来好像细胞是分层的，但实际上并非如此。


被动语态:
Pseudostratification was observed in the sample. = 在样本中观察到假复层结构。
The function of pseudostratified epithelium is still being studied. = 假复层上皮的功能仍在研究中。


疑问句:
Is this epithelium truly stratified, or is it pseudostratified? = 这种上皮是真正的复层还是假复层？
What are the key features that distinguish pseudostratification from true stratification? = 区分假复层与真复层的关键特征是什么？


否定句:
This tissue is not truly stratified; it's pseudostratified. = 这种组织不是真正的复层；它是假复层。
The cells do not form multiple distinct layers; the appearance of stratification is deceptive. = 细胞没有形成多层不同的层；分层的外观是具有欺骗性的。


PHRASE->

pseudostratified columnar epithelium: 假复层柱状上皮
pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium: 假复层纤毛柱状上皮
pseudostratified epithelium of the trachea: 气管的假复层上皮
types of pseudostratified epithelium: 假复层上皮的类型
function of pseudostratified epithelium: 假复层上皮的功能


词源:

pseudo- (from Greek ψευδής, meaning "false" or "deceptive") + stratification (from Latin *stratum, meaning "layer," + -ification, a suffix indicating the process of making something layered).  Thus, "pseudostratification" literally means "false layering."
