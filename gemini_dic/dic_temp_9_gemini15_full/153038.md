词源:

The word "peeling" comes from the verb "to peel," meaning to remove the skin or outer layer of something.  "Off" is an adverb indicating separation or detachment. The combination "peeling off" describes the action of this separation happening.  The root likely traces back to Proto-Germanic *peljan, meaning "to skin."
