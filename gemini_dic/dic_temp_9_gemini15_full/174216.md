quenchers:/ˈkwɛntʃərz/| n.|猝灭剂；抑制剂；消光剂|A quencher is a substance that reduces or eliminates the intensity of a signal, typically fluorescence or phosphorescence.  They are used in various scientific and technological applications to control or modify the behavior of light-emitting molecules.|Example:  The researchers used a specific molecule as a quencher to suppress the fluorescence of the dye.  研究人员使用了一种特定的分子作为猝灭剂来抑制染料的荧光。|近义词：inhibitor, suppressor, damper|反义词：activator, enhancer|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The chemical acts as a quencher in this reaction. = 在这个反应中，这种化学物质充当猝灭剂。
This solution quenches the fluorescence effectively. = 这种溶液有效地猝灭了荧光。


一般过去时:
The experiment quenched the signal completely. = 实验完全抑制了信号。
They quenched the excited state of the molecule. = 他们猝灭了分子的激发态。


现在完成时:
Researchers have developed new quenchers for various applications. = 研究人员已经开发出用于各种应用的新型猝灭剂。
The company has successfully quenched the unwanted fluorescence. = 该公司已成功抑制了不需要的荧光。


过去完成时:
The reaction had already quenched the fluorescence before the measurement. = 在测量之前，反应已经猝灭了荧光。
They had previously used this quencher in similar experiments. = 他们之前在类似的实验中使用过这种猝灭剂。


将来时:
We will use a different quencher in the next experiment. = 我们将在下一次实验中使用不同的猝灭剂。
The new technology will effectively quench background noise. = 新技术将有效抑制背景噪声。


虚拟语气:
If we used a stronger quencher, the signal would be weaker. = 如果我们使用更强的猝灭剂，信号就会更弱。
I wish we had a more efficient quencher for this application. = 我希望我们有更有效的猝灭剂用于此应用。


被动语态:
The fluorescence was quenched by the addition of the quencher. = 通过添加猝灭剂来猝灭荧光。
The signal is quenched by the use of this method. = 通过使用这种方法来抑制信号。


疑问句:
What type of quencher is best suited for this experiment? = 对于这个实验，哪种类型的猝灭剂最合适？
Does this quencher affect the other components of the system? = 这种猝灭剂是否会影响系统的其他组分？


否定句:
The quencher did not completely eliminate the fluorescence. = 猝灭剂并没有完全消除荧光。
This method does not effectively quench the signal in all cases. = 在所有情况下，这种方法都不能有效地抑制信号。


PHRASE->
fluorescence quencher  荧光猝灭剂
oxygen quencher 氧猝灭剂
dynamic quencher 动态猝灭剂
static quencher 静态猝灭剂
quencher concentration 猝灭剂浓度
