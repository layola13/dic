The word "notwheat" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word, or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide an analysis, we would need context in which this word was used.  If you can provide the source or sentence where you encountered "notwheat," I can offer a possible interpretation and analysis based on that context.
