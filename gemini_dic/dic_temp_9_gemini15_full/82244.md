词源:

The word "groundably" is derived from the adjective "groundable," which in turn comes from the noun "ground."  The noun "ground" in this context refers to a basis or foundation for belief or action.  The suffix "-able" transforms the noun into an adjective meaning "capable of being grounded," and the further addition of "-ly" creates the adverb "groundably."  The core meaning stems from the idea of something being well-founded or supported by sufficient evidence.
