用法说明:

consubstantially is primarily used in formal contexts, often in philosophical or theological discussions. It emphasizes a deep, shared essence or nature, going beyond mere surface similarities.  It suggests an underlying unity despite apparent differences.  While "essentially" or "fundamentally" can often be used as synonyms,  "consubstantially" carries a stronger implication of shared substance or being.
