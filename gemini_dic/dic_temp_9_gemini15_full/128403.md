newcastle-upon-tyne: /ˈnjuːkɑːs(ə)l əˈpɒn taɪn/ | n. | 纽卡斯尔 upon 泰恩 | Newcastle-upon-Tyne is a city in Tyne and Wear, England.  It is situated on the River Tyne, and its name reflects this location. "Newcastle" refers to a new castle built there, while "upon Tyne" specifies its position on the River Tyne. The city is known for its rich history, its industrial heritage, and its vibrant cultural scene. |  I visited Newcastle-upon-Tyne last year and was impressed by its architecture. = 我去年参观了纽卡斯尔，对它的建筑印象深刻。


The city's name is a compound of two elements:


"Newcastle" :  This part of the name comes from the Norman-French word *nouvel*, meaning "new," and the Old English word *ceaster*, meaning "fort" or "castle."  This reflects the construction of a new castle in the area, likely in the 11th century, by Robert de Mowbray.

"upon Tyne": This phrase simply means "on the River Tyne," indicating the geographical location of the city.  "Upon" is an archaic preposition, still used in place names, indicating location or position. "Tyne" is the name of the river itself, of Celtic origin, though its exact etymology is uncertain.  Some theories connect it to words meaning "river" or "water."
