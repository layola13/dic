词源:

The word "intently" derives from the adjective "intent," which comes from the Old French word "intente," meaning "intention, purpose."  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner in which an action is performed.  The root is likely related to Latin "intendere," meaning "to stretch, strain, aim."  This reflects the idea of focused attention and purposefulness.
