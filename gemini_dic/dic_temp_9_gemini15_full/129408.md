nominalizes:/ˈnɑːmɪnəlaɪz/ | vt. | 名词化；使…成为名词 | To convert (a verb, adjective, or other part of speech) into a noun.  This often involves using a suffix like "-tion," "-ment," "-ance," or "-ing." Nominalization can make writing more concise but can also lead to overly abstract and less engaging prose. | Example:  The *investigation* of the crime revealed new evidence. (Nominalization of "investigate") | 近义词:  substantivize | 反义词:  verbify (though not a direct opposite, it represents the opposite process)
