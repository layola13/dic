词源:

The word "naphthalenic" is derived from "naphthalene," which in turn originates from the Greek word "ναφθα" (naphtha), meaning "rock oil" or "bitumen," combined with the suffix "-ene," a common chemical suffix indicating an unsaturated hydrocarbon.  The "-ic" suffix adds an adjectival quality.
