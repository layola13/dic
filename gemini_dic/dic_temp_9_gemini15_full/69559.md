词源:
The word "fellowshipped" is derived from the noun "fellowship," which ultimately comes from the Middle English word "felaweshipe," meaning "companionship, association."  The suffix "-ed" indicates the past participle or past tense of the verb.  The concept of "fellowship" evolved to include the idea of financial support for academic or professional pursuits.
