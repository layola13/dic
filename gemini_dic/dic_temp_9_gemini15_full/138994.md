nymphiparous: /nɪmˈfɪpərəs/ | adj. | 胎生的；卵胎生的 | Relating to or characterized by the production of nymphs instead of eggs.  This term is primarily used in entomology and refers to insects whose eggs hatch within the mother's body, resulting in live birth of nymphs, rather than laying eggs.  The term distinguishes this reproductive strategy from oviparity (egg-laying) and viviparity (live birth of fully developed young).
