词源:
The word "neurasthenics" is derived from the Greek words "neuron" (νεῦρον), meaning "nerve," and "asthenia" (ἀσθένεια), meaning "weakness" or "lack of strength."  Therefore, it literally translates to "nerve weakness." The suffix "-ics" indicates a person or thing characterized by the condition.
