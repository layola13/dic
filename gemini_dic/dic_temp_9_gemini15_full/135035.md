nonnihilism: /ˌnɒnˈnaɪəlɪzəm/ | n. |非虚无主义| The philosophical position that rejects nihilism;  a belief that life has meaning and value, even in the face of apparent meaninglessness or absurdity.  It often involves finding meaning in personal experience, relationships, or creative endeavors.  It's not necessarily a belief in a specific overarching meaning of life, but rather a rejection of the claim that there is *no* meaning. |Example:  His nonnihilistic worldview led him to actively pursue his passions and build meaningful relationships.  他的非虚无主义世界观促使他积极追求自己的热情并建立有意义的人际关系。  |近义词:  existentialism (in some aspects),  affirmation of life |反义词: nihilism
