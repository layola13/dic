词源:

The term "might-have-been" is a combination of the modal verb "might," indicating possibility, and the past perfect "have been," suggesting a past unrealized state.  It evolved naturally from the grammatical structure of hypothetical scenarios and counterfactual statements in English.  There is no single etymological origin point as it is a combination of existing words expressing a common thought pattern.
