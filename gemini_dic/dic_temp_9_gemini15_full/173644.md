词源:  The word is a combination of "quasi-" (meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent") and "intuitive" (meaning "knowing or understanding something without conscious reasoning").  "Quasi-" comes from Latin *quasi ("as if," "almost"). "Intuitive" originates from the Latin word *intuītus, the past participle of *intuerī ("to look at," "to contemplate").
