The hymen can vary greatly in shape and size, and can be broken by activities other than sexual intercourse.|例句：The presence or absence of a hymen is not a reliable indicator of virginity. 处女膜的有无并不能可靠地指示是否是处女。|例句：Some cultures place significant importance on the hymen. 一些文化非常重视处女膜。|近义词：membrane (in a biological context)|反义词：无|名词
