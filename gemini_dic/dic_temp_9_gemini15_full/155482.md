phenotypes:/ˈfiːnoʊtaɪps/ | n. | 表型 | The observable characteristics of an organism, resulting from the interaction of its genotype with the environment.  This includes physical traits, behavioral characteristics, and biochemical properties. | Example: The phenotypes of the plants included flower color, height, and seed shape.  这些植物的表型包括花色、高度和种子形状。 |近义词: characteristics, traits, appearances |反义词: genotype


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The phenotypes of these flowers are quite diverse. = 这些花的表型相当多样化。
His phenotype shows a predisposition to heart disease. = 他的表型显示出患心脏病的倾向。


一般过去时:
The researchers observed several distinct phenotypes in the study group. = 研究人员在研究组中观察到几种不同的表型。
Her phenotype changed slightly after the treatment. = 治疗后她的表型略有变化。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified many different phenotypes associated with this gene. = 科学家们已经确定了许多与该基因相关的不同表型。
We have observed a range of phenotypes in the offspring. = 我们在后代中观察到一系列的表型。


过去完成时:
Before the mutation, the organism's phenotype was normal. = 在突变之前，该生物体的表型是正常的。
The scientists had already documented several similar phenotypes in previous studies. = 科学家们已经在之前的研究中记录了几种类似的表型。


将来时:
We will analyze the phenotypes of the next generation of plants. = 我们将分析下一代植物的表型。
Future research will focus on understanding the relationship between genotype and phenotype. = 未来的研究将集中于理解基因型和表型之间的关系。


虚拟语气:
If the genotype were different, the phenotype might also be different. = 如果基因型不同，表型也可能不同。
It would be helpful if we had more information about the phenotypes. = 如果我们有更多关于表型的信息就好了。


被动语态:
The phenotypes were carefully measured and recorded. = 表型被仔细测量和记录。
Several distinct phenotypes have been identified in the population. = 人群中已经确定了几种不同的表型。


疑问句:
What are the most common phenotypes in this population? = 在这个群体中最常见的表型是什么？
How are these phenotypes influenced by environmental factors? = 这些表型是如何受环境因素影响的？


否定句:
The phenotypes did not show any significant differences. = 表型没有显示任何显著差异。
There were no observable phenotypes associated with the mutation. = 与突变相关的表型不可见。


PHRASE->
observable phenotype = 可观察的表型
phenotype expression = 表型表达
phenotype variation = 表型变异
