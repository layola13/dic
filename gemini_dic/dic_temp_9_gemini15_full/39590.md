词源:
From Old French *consacrer, from Latin consecrare "to make sacred," from con- "together" + sacrare "to make sacred."  The root *sacr- is related to the Latin sacer "sacred," and ultimately to the Proto-Indo-European root *sek- "to cut," suggesting a ritualistic separation or setting apart as sacred.
