词源:

The word "forswornness" is derived from the verb "forswear," which itself has a complex etymology.

* **for-**:  A prefix meaning "completely" or "away."

* **swear**:  From Old English *swōrian*, meaning "to swear," ultimately related to Proto-Germanic *swōrōn*.  This root reflects a sense of solemn affirmation or oath-taking.

Therefore, "forswear" originally meant to "swear away" or to renounce something solemnly sworn to.  "Forswornness" then naturally follows as the noun form, describing the state of having forsworn something.
