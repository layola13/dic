hydrobiplane:/ˈhaɪdroʊbaɪˌpleɪn/| n. |水上飞机|A hydrobiplane is a type of seaplane that uses two floats for buoyancy instead of a single hull.  It combines features of both biplanes (two sets of wings) and seaplanes (ability to take off and land on water).  The term is relatively uncommon, as most seaplanes are now monoplanes.|The Curtiss HS2L was a notable example of a hydrobiplane used during World War I.|近义词: seaplane, floatplane|反义词: landplane
