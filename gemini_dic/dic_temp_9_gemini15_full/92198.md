词源:

The word "hypersuggestible" is a combination of:

* **hyper-**:  A prefix meaning "excessive," "above," or "beyond."  Derived from Greek ὑπέρ (hupér) meaning "over," "above," "beyond."

* **suggestible**:  An adjective meaning "easily influenced by suggestion."  Derived from "suggest," which ultimately traces back to Latin *suggerere* ("to bring up," "to hint").


Therefore, "hypersuggestible" literally means "excessively suggestible" or "beyond the normal level of suggestibility."
