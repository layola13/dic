polyarchy:/ˈpɒliɑːki/| /ˈpɑːliˌɑːrki/| n.| 多元政治，寡头政治 | A system of government in which power is invested in multiple people, typically a small group of elite rulers.  It's characterized by the presence of multiple competing groups vying for power, often within a framework of democratic processes like elections, but lacking full democratic ideals due to limitations on participation or restrictions on power sharing. | Example:  The country transitioned from a dictatorship to a more open polyarchy, with multiple parties competing in elections. = 这个国家从独裁统治过渡到一个更开放的多元政治体制，多个政党在选举中竞争。


The term is often used to describe a system that is not fully democratic but exhibits some democratic features.  Some scholars use it to analyze regimes that are halfway between democracy and authoritarianism. = 这个术语通常用来描述一个并非完全民主但具备某些民主特征的制度。一些学者用它来分析介于民主和专制之间的政权。
