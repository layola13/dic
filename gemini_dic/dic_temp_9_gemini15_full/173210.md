quasi-classically:/ˈkwɑːzaɪˈklæsɪkli/| adj.|准经典地；半经典地|Approximating or resembling classical mechanics, but incorporating some quantum mechanical effects.  It's used to describe a method or approach that blends aspects of both classical and quantum physics.  This often involves treating certain parts of a system classically while treating others quantum mechanically.|例句：The quasi-classical trajectory method is used to study the dynamics of chemical reactions. 准经典轨迹法用于研究化学反应的动力学。

The system was modeled quasi-classically, treating the nuclei classically and the electrons quantum mechanically.  系统采用准经典方法建模，将原子核处理为经典体系，电子处理为量子体系。|近义词：semiclassically|反义词：purely classically, purely quantum mechanically|


词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "almost," or "like."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation.

* **classically**: From "classical," referring to classical mechanics, the physics of macroscopic objects governed by Newton's laws.


用法说明:

The term "quasi-classically" is primarily used in physics, particularly in areas like:

* **Chemical physics:**  To describe approximations in calculating reaction rates and other dynamical properties.

* **Quantum mechanics:** To describe methods that bridge the gap between classical and quantum descriptions of systems.  This often involves using classical concepts (like trajectories) but incorporating quantum effects like tunneling or quantization of energy levels.

* **Nuclear physics:** In studying the behaviour of nuclei.


例句补充:

*  In this regime, a quasi-classical approximation is valid. 在这种情况下，准经典近似是有效的。
* The calculations were performed quasi-classically, yielding results consistent with experimental observations. 计算是准经典进行的，结果与实验观察结果一致。
