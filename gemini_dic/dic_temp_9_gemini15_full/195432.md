/ˌsɛmɪˈnɜːvəsnɪsɪz/ | n. | 半紧张状态，轻微的紧张感 | The word "seminervousnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a contrived formation combining "semi-" (meaning half or partly) and "nervousnesses" (the plural of nervousness).  It attempts to describe a state of being somewhat nervous, but it's awkward and uncommon.  A native speaker would likely use a simpler and more natural expression. |  The speaker displayed several seminervousnesses before giving her presentation, fidgeting and clearing her throat repeatedly.  演讲者在做演讲之前表现出几次轻微的紧张，反复地摆弄东西并清清嗓子。 | slight nervousness, mild anxiety, apprehension | calmness, composure, serenity |  n.
