词源:

The word "injudiciousness" is derived from the adjective "injudicious," which itself comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "judicious," meaning "having, showing, or done with good judgment; wise."  "Judicious" ultimately traces back to the Latin word "judicium," meaning "judgment."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, denoting the quality or state of being injudicious.
