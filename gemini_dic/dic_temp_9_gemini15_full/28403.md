carbonate: /ˈkɑːrbəneɪt/ /ˈkɑːrbənət/ | n. |碳酸盐，碳酸酯| A salt of carbonic acid, typically formed by the reaction of carbonic acid with a base. Carbonates are common in rocks and minerals.  | Example: Limestone is a common carbonate rock. 石灰岩是一种常见的碳酸盐岩。  The ocean is saturated with carbonates. 海洋充满了碳酸盐。 |近义词：bicarbonate (sometimes)|反义词：无|名词

词源:
The word "carbonate" originates from the French word "carbonate," which in turn derives from the Latin "carbo," meaning "coal" or "charcoal," referring to the carbon element present in carbonate compounds.  The suffix "-ate" denotes a salt.
