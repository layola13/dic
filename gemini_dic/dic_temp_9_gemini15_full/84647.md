词源:  The word "handbagging" is a relatively recent coinage, combining "handbag" (a woman's bag) with "-ing" (indicating the act of doing something).  The implication is that the theft involves taking items from a handbag or from a store, often surreptitiously.  It highlights the method of theft rather than the specific items stolen.
