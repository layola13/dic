词源:
The word "inlapidate" is a relatively rare word, likely a blend or a back-formation from "dilapidate."  "Dilapidate" itself comes from the Late Latin *dilapidāre,  formed from *dis- (apart) + *lapidāre (to stone, to build with stones). The original sense, therefore, referred to the process of taking apart a stone structure. Over time, the meaning shifted to the more general sense of decay and ruin.  The prefix "in-" adds emphasis to the process of causing something to fall into ruin.
