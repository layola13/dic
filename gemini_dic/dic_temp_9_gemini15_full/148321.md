词源:

The word is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great degree) with the adverb "sorrowfully" (meaning in a sorrowful manner).  "Sorrowfully" itself derives from the noun "sorrow" (meaning sadness or grief) plus the adverbial suffix "-fully".  Therefore, the word's meaning is literally "excessively sorrowfully".
