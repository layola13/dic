词源:
The word "rollerball" is a compound word.  "Roller" refers to the small ball bearing within the pen that distributes ink, and "ball" refers to this ball bearing itself.  The "-ball" suffix is commonly used to describe objects that are spherical or ball-shaped.  The word emerged in the mid-20th century with the invention and popularity of ballpoint pens.  The sporting sense is a more recent development.
