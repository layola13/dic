immiscible: /ɪˈmɪsɪbl/ | adj. | 不相溶的；不混溶的 |  Not capable of being mixed or blended.  Immiscible liquids, for example, will separate into distinct layers when combined. | Example: Oil and water are immiscible; they will always separate into two layers. 油和水不相溶；它们总是会分成两层。  | 近义词: unmixable, incompatible | 反义词: miscible


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Oil and water are immiscible. = 油和水不相溶。
These two chemicals are immiscible at room temperature. = 这两种化学物质在室温下不相溶。


一般过去时:
The experiment showed that the two liquids were immiscible. = 实验表明这两种液体不相溶。
The oil and water mixture quickly separated because they were immiscible. = 油水混合物迅速分离，因为它们不相溶。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered that these substances have always been immiscible. = 科学家们已经发现这些物质一直不相溶。
We have confirmed that the two solutions are immiscible under these conditions. = 我们已经证实这两种溶液在这些条件下不相溶。


过去完成时:
It had already been established that the components were immiscible. = 已经确定这些成分不相溶。
Researchers had found that the two fluids were immiscible even at high temperatures. = 研究人员发现，即使在高温下，这两种流体也无法混合。


将来时:
The mixture will separate into layers because the liquids are immiscible. = 混合物将分层，因为液体不相溶。
We predict that the two substances will remain immiscible even under pressure. = 我们预测这两种物质即使在压力下仍将不相溶。


虚拟语气:
If the liquids were miscible, we would have a homogeneous solution. = 如果液体可以混合，我们将得到一种均匀的溶液。
If the two substances were immiscible, the mixture would separate. = 如果这两种物质不相溶，混合物就会分离。


被动语态:
The immiscibility of the liquids was clearly demonstrated in the experiment. = 实验清楚地证明了液体的互不相溶性。
It was determined that the materials were immiscible. = 确定这些材料不相溶。


疑问句:
Are oil and vinegar immiscible? = 油和醋不相溶吗？
Is this solvent immiscible with water? = 这种溶剂与水不相溶吗？


否定句:
The liquids are not immiscible; they form a homogeneous mixture. = 这些液体并非不相溶；它们形成了均匀的混合物。
The components are not always immiscible under all conditions. = 这些成分并非在所有条件下都不相溶。


PHRASE->
immiscible liquids = 不相溶的液体
immiscible phases = 不相溶的相
immiscible with water = 与水不相溶
degree of immiscibility = 不相溶程度
immiscible mixtures = 不相溶混合物
