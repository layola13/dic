词源:
"Doggoning" is a euphemistic variation of "doggone," which itself is a milder substitute for "damn." The origin of "doggone" is uncertain but likely arose in the 19th century as a way to avoid using stronger profanity.  The "-ing" suffix adds emphasis, similar to other intensifying suffixes like "-ing" in phrases such as "terribly" or "awfully".
