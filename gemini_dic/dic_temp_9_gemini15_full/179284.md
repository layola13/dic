词源:

The word "rediverting" is formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") to the present participle "diverting."  "Diverting" comes from the verb "divert," which originates from the Old French word "divertir," meaning "to turn aside, amuse."  The ultimate Latin root is "divertere,"  composed of "dis-" (apart) and "vertere" (to turn).  Therefore, "rediverting" literally means "to turn aside again."
