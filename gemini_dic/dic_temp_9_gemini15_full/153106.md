pegmatoid:/ˈpeɡmətɔɪd/ | n. |似伟晶岩的；伟晶岩状岩石 |A rock resembling pegmatite in texture or mineral composition, but not necessarily of the same origin.  It often shows a coarse-grained texture with large crystals. |例句：The geologist identified the sample as a pegmatoid, noting its large feldspar crystals.  地质学家将样本鉴定为似伟晶岩的岩石，并指出了其大型长石晶体。

The outcrop exhibited a pegmatoid texture, indicative of slow cooling.  露头显示出似伟晶岩的结构，表明冷却速度缓慢。|近义词：coarse-grained rock, granitoid |反义词：fine-grained rock |

否定句:
This rock is not a pegmatoid; it's a different type of rock. = 这块岩石不是似伟晶岩；它是另一种类型的岩石。
The sample did not exhibit the typical characteristics of a pegmatoid. = 样本没有表现出似伟晶岩的典型特征。


PHRASE->
pegmatoid texture: 似伟晶岩结构
pegmatoid body: 似伟晶岩体
pegmatoid formation: 似伟晶岩构造

词源:
The word "pegmatoid" is derived from "pegmatite" + "-oid,"  "-oid" being a suffix meaning "resembling" or "having the form of."  Pegmatite itself comes from Greek words relating to its compact structure.
