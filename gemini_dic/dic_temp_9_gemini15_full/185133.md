retinophora: /ˌrɛtɪˈnɒfərə/ | n. |视网膜载体| A retinophora is a specialized cell in the retina of some animals, particularly invertebrates, that contains a pigment and is involved in light detection.  These cells are often part of a more complex visual system.  They are not as sophisticated as the photoreceptor cells found in vertebrate retinas, but they perform a similar function in simpler organisms. | Example:  The researchers studied the retinophora of the jellyfish to understand its primitive visual system.  研究人员研究了水母的视网膜载体以了解其原始的视觉系统。| 近义词: photoreceptor (in a broader sense)| 反义词: N/A |  名词


USAGE->
This word is a relatively specific scientific term and doesn't readily lend itself to common grammatical structures like the examples provided for "what".  It's typically used in the context of scientific papers and descriptions of biological systems.  Therefore, example sentences will reflect this usage.

一般现在时:
The retinophora absorbs light and triggers a signal. = 视网膜载体吸收光线并触发信号。
Many invertebrates possess simple retinophora. = 许多无脊椎动物拥有简单的视网膜载体。


一般过去时:
Scientists observed the retinophora's response to different wavelengths. = 科学家观察了视网膜载体对不同波长的反应。
Researchers identified a novel pigment within the retinophora. = 研究人员在视网膜载体中发现了一种新的色素。


现在完成时:
Studies have shown the evolution of retinophora. = 研究表明视网膜载体的进化。
Scientists have mapped the distribution of retinophora in various species. = 科学家已经绘制了各种物种中视网膜载体的分布图。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had prepared the retinophora samples. = 在实验之前，他们已经准备好了视网膜载体样本。
The researchers had hypothesized that the retinophora functioned differently. = 研究人员曾假设视网膜载体的功能不同。


将来时:
Future research will investigate the molecular mechanisms of retinophora. = 未来的研究将调查视网膜载体的分子机制。
Scientists will analyze the retinophora's sensitivity to light intensity. = 科学家将分析视网膜载体对光强度的敏感性。


虚拟语气:
If the retinophora were more sensitive, the animal's vision would be improved. = 如果视网膜载体更灵敏，动物的视力就会提高。
It is likely that if the retinophora were damaged, vision would be impaired. = 视网膜载体受损，视力很可能会下降。


被动语态:
The retinophora's structure was carefully examined under a microscope. = 视网膜载体的结构在显微镜下被仔细检查。
The signal from the retinophora is processed by the nervous system. = 来自视网膜载体的信号由神经系统处理。


疑问句:
What is the function of the retinophora in this species? = 在这个物种中视网膜载体的功能是什么？
How does the retinophora differ from vertebrate photoreceptors? = 视网膜载体与脊椎动物的光感受器有何不同？


否定句:
The retinophora did not respond to red light. = 视网膜载体没有对红光作出反应。
This species does not possess complex retinophora. = 这个物种不拥有复杂的视网膜载体。
