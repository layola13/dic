词源:

The word "nonchurch" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "church."  The prefix "non-" is derived from Latin, and "church" has Old English roots.  Therefore, "nonchurch" is a relatively modern coinage reflecting a growing separation of secular and religious spheres in society.
