The word "rader" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested is not possible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Perhaps "radar," "reader," or another word entirely?
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word, a technical term within a specific field, or slang used in a particular community.  If you provide context (where you encountered this word), a more accurate analysis might be possible.
* **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or place name.


If you can provide more information, I can try to help.
