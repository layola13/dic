cyanaurate:/ˌsaɪəˈnɔːreɪt/| n. |氰化金酸盐|A cyanaurate is a salt or ester of cyanic acid containing a cyano group (-CN) and a metal such as gold.  These compounds are typically formed through the reaction of a metal cyanide with a source of cyanic acid.  They are often complex coordination compounds with interesting properties related to the metal's oxidation state and ligand environment. They are less common than other gold salts.|The gold cyanaurate complex exhibited unique optical properties.|近义词：gold cyanide (though not a direct synonym, it's related)|反义词：无
