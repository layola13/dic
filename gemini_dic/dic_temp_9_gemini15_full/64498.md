PHRASE->

There is no common phrase directly using "erodibilities".  However, phrases related to the concept include:

rate of erodibility: 可蚀性速率
soil erodibility factor: 土壤可蚀性因子
erodibility characteristics: 可蚀性特征
factors affecting erodibility: 影响可蚀性的因素
assessment of erodibility: 可蚀性评估


词源:

The word "erodibilities" is derived from the verb "erode," ultimately stemming from the Latin word "erodere," meaning "to gnaw away" or "to eat into."  The suffix "-ibility" indicates capacity or susceptibility. Therefore, "erodibilities" signifies the different capacities or susceptibilities of materials to be eroded.
