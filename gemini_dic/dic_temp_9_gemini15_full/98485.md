词源:
The word "installment" comes from the verb "install," meaning "to set in place," ultimately derived from the Old French "installer" (to establish, settle) and the Latin "installare" (to place, fix).  The "-ment" suffix indicates a noun related to the action of the verb.  The meaning evolved to refer to the act of paying in parts, likely because payments were "installed" or fixed at regular intervals.
