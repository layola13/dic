The word "inactose" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "lactose," "inact," or another word entirely?

2. **It's a neologism or technical term:**  It might be a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field (e.g., medicine, chemistry).  If you can provide the context where you encountered this word, it might be possible to determine its meaning.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name, a brand name, or place name.


Please provide more context or clarify the spelling so a proper analysis can be given.
