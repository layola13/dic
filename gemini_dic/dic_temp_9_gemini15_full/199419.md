The word "simpon" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis as requested.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling of another word.  If you can provide the intended word, I can offer an analysis.
* It's a proper noun (a name, place, etc.)  If so, more context is needed.
* It's a neologism (newly coined word) or slang specific to a particular community or context.  Again, more information is needed.


Please clarify the word or provide more context so I can assist you.
