desublimating: /ˌdiːsʌbliˈmeɪtɪŋ/ | v. | 去升华；使...脱气 | The process of changing from a solid state directly to a gaseous state, and then back to a solid state, bypassing the liquid phase. This is often used in the context of chemical processes, particularly in the purification of substances.  | Example: The desublimating process removed impurities from the final product.  The chemist carefully monitored the desublimating of the iodine. |近义词：sublimation (reverse process)|反义词：sublimating


USAGE->
一般现在时:
