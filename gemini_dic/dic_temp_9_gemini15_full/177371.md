reauditions:/ˌriːɔːˈdɪʃənz/ | n. | 再试镜；重新试镜 | The word "reauditions" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word) formed by combining "re-" (meaning again) and "auditions" (the process of trying out for a role). It implies the act of holding auditions again, perhaps after an initial round, or for different roles.  There is no established meaning or usage in dictionaries.  Therefore, providing examples in various tenses and other grammatical structures is not possible as it lacks established usage. |  No direct examples available as it's not a standard word.  A possible usage could be: "The casting director announced further reauditions for the lead role."  |  近义词:  rehearsals (if it refers to a practice rather than selection),  second auditions, repeat auditions | 反义词: N/A | n.
