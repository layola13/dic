depolarizing: /ˌdiːˈpoʊləraɪzɪŋ/ | adj. | 去极化的；使去极化的 |  Describing the process of reducing or eliminating the polarization of something, often referring to the electrical potential difference across a membrane.  This typically involves a change in membrane potential, making it less negative (or more positive).  |

例句：
The influx of sodium ions caused depolarizing of the neuron's membrane.  = 钠离子的涌入导致神经元膜的去极化。

The drug induced a depolarizing block of neuromuscular transmission. = 该药物诱导了神经肌肉传递的去极化阻滞。


近义词：despolarizing,  activating (in the context of nerve cells)

反义词：polarizing, hyperpolarizing


词性: Adjective


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The drug is depolarizing the cells. = 药物正在使细胞去极化。
Depolarization is crucial for nerve impulse transmission. = 去极化对于神经冲动传递至关重要。

一般过去时:

Researchers have observed that repeated stimulation depolarizes the nerve. = 研究人员观察到重复刺激会使神经去极化。

过去完成时:
The cell had already depolarized before the measurement was taken. = 在进行测量之前，细胞已经去极化了。
The muscle had depolarized completely by the time the signal arrived. = 当信号到达时，肌肉已经完全去极化了。

将来时:
The application of the current will depolarize the membrane. = 电流的施加将使膜去极化。
The scientists predict that the new drug will depolarize the affected neurons. = 科学家预测这种新药将使受影响的神经元去极化。

虚拟语气:
If the membrane were depolarized, an action potential would occur. = 如果膜去极化，就会产生动作电位。
I wish the cells had not depolarized so quickly. = 我希望细胞没有这么快去极化。

被动语态:
The membrane was depolarized by the influx of sodium ions. = 膜被钠离子的涌入所去极化。
The neurons are being depolarized by the electrical stimulus. = 神经元正在被电刺激去极化。

疑问句:
Is the cell depolarizing? = 细胞正在去极化吗？
How quickly did the membrane depolarize? = 膜去极化速度有多快？

否定句:
The membrane did not depolarize significantly. = 膜没有显著去极化。
The drug did not depolarize the nerve cells. = 该药物没有使神经细胞去极化。


PHRASE->
depolarizing current = 去极化电流
depolarizing agent = 去极化剂
depolarizing block = 去极化阻滞
depolarizing effect = 去极化效应
depolarizing potential = 去极化电位


词源:
The word "depolarizing" comes from the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse"), "polar" (referring to the poles or opposite charges), and "-izing" (a suffix indicating the process of making something). Thus, depolarizing describes the process of removing or reversing the polarization.
