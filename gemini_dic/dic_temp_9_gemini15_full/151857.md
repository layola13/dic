passionatenesses:/ˈpæʃənətˌnɛsɪz/| n.|热情洋溢的状态，激情程度的多种表现|The word "passionatenesses" is not a standard English word. It's an unusual and likely incorrect formation attempting to create a plural noun form of "passionateness," which itself is already a noun describing the state of being passionate.  A more appropriate way to express multiple instances of passionate behavior or states would be to use the plural of "passion," "passions," or to use "passionateness" with a phrase indicating multiple instances, such as "various degrees of passionateness."|例句：There is no standard usage example because the word is not standard.  One could construct an example illustrating the intended (though incorrect) meaning:  "The various passionatenesses displayed during the debate were quite astonishing." (This sentence would be better written as "The various passionate displays during the debate were quite astonishing.")|近义词：passions, fervors, intensities, enthusiasms|反义词：apathy, indifference, coldness|名词
