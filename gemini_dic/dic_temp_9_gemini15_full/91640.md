USAGE->

This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "hello".  Its usage depends heavily on the context (mathematical or rhetorical).  There's no "present tense" or "past tense" of hyperbolicity itself.  Instead, we talk about *something exhibiting* hyperbolicity.

Example sentences illustrating different grammatical structures:

Statement:
The high degree of hyperbolicity in his speech made it difficult to discern the truth. 他讲话中高度的夸张使得难以辨别真相。

Question:
Does this mathematical model exhibit hyperbolicity?  这个数学模型是否表现出双曲性？

Negative statement:
The lack of hyperbolicity in her writing made it seem rather bland. 她写作中缺乏夸张使其显得相当平淡。
