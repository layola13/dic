The word "prerespectable" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need to consider possibilities:

**Possibility 1: Misspelling**

If it's a misspelling,  it might be intended as one of the following:

* **Respectable:** /rɪˈspektəbl/ | adj. | 可敬的，体面的 | Worthy of respect; having a good reputation. | Example: He is a respectable member of the community. 他是社区里一位受人尊敬的成员。 | 近义词: estimable, honorable, reputable | 反义词: disreputable, dishonorable

* **Pre-respectable:** (This is a hypothetical word, combining "pre-" meaning before and "respectable.")  It could potentially mean "on the way to becoming respectable," or "showing signs of becoming respectable," but this is purely speculative and not established usage.


**Possibility 2:  Intentional Neologism**

If it's an intentional neologism, the meaning would depend entirely on the author's intent.  Without context, it's impossible to determine its meaning or grammatical properties.


Since the word doesn't exist, I cannot provide the requested grammatical examples, phrases, etc.  To get a proper analysis, please provide the sentence or context in which you encountered "prerespectable."  This will allow for a better understanding of the intended meaning and potentially identify the correct word or its intended meaning.
