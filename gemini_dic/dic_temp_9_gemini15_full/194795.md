The word "sely" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of another word.  Without context, it's impossible to say which word it might be.  Possible candidates depend heavily on context (e.g., "self", "silly", "seldom").

2. **A dialectal word:** It might be a word used in a specific dialect or region, not widely known or documented.

3. **A newly coined word:** It might be a newly invented or very rarely used word.

4. **A proper noun:** It could possibly be a name or place name.


To provide the requested analysis, I need more information about where you encountered this word and the surrounding context.  With more information, I might be able to determine its meaning and provide a more complete analysis.
