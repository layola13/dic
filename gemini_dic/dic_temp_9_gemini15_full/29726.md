cations:/ˈkætaɪənz/ | n. |阳离子|Positively charged ions.  Cations are formed when an atom loses one or more electrons, resulting in a net positive charge. They are a fundamental component of many chemical compounds and play crucial roles in various biological processes.|Example: Sodium ions (Na+) are common cations in the human body.|近义词：positive ions|反义词：anions
