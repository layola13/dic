词源:
The word "roister" ultimately derives from the Middle Dutch word "ruisteren," meaning "to boast" or "to swagger."  This evolved into the Middle English "roister," which originally described a boisterous and swaggering man.  The meaning then shifted to encompass the noisy and merry activity associated with such a person.
