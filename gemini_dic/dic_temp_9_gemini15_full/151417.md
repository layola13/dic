词源:  Derived from "parochial," ultimately from the Greek word "paroikia" (παροικία), meaning "dwelling near," "a place of residence," which evolved to refer to a religious district or the inhabitants of a parish.  The adjective form then developed to describe things relating to or characteristic of a parish, and later took on the connotation of narrow-mindedness associated with limited perspectives.
