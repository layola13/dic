dolomize:/ˈdɒləmaɪz/ | v. |白云石化；使变成白云石 | To change (a rock or mineral) into dolomite or a dolomitic rock.  The process often involves the replacement of calcium carbonate with magnesium carbonate. |The limestone was dolomitized during the diagenetic process.  石灰岩在成岩过程中发生了白云石化。|The ancient reef was extensively dolomitized. 古代礁石广泛地白云石化了。|近义词：magnesify |反义词：de-dolomitize


USAGE->

一般现在时:

过去完成时:
The rock had already dolomitized before the uplift event occurred. = 在隆起事件发生之前，岩石就已经白云石化了。
Before the analysis, the sample had partially dolomitized. = 在分析之前，样品已经部分白云石化了。


将来时:
The ongoing hydrothermal activity will further dolomitize the surrounding rocks. = 正在进行的热液活动将进一步使周围岩石白云石化。

虚拟语气:
If the conditions were right, the limestone would dolomitize more quickly. = 如果条件合适，石灰岩会更快地白云石化。
It is likely that the rock would have dolomitized more completely if the temperature had been higher. = 如果温度更高，岩石很可能已经更完全地白云石化了。


被动语态:
The rock sample was dolomitized in the laboratory. = 岩石样品在实验室中被白云石化。
The ancient reef was extensively dolomitized by diagenetic processes. = 古代礁石被成岩作用广泛地白云石化了。


疑问句:
Has this rock formation been dolomitized? = 这片岩层是否已经白云石化？
To what extent has the limestone dolomitized? = 石灰岩白云石化的程度如何？


否定句:
The sandstone did not dolomitize under these conditions. = 在这些条件下，砂岩没有白云石化。
