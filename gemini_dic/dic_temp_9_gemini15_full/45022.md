ctenocyst: /ˈtiːnəʊsɪst/ | n. |栉胞囊，纤毛囊| A ctenocyst is a specialized sensory organ found in ctenophores (comb jellies). It's a statocyst, meaning it's involved in balance and orientation.  It consists of a spherical vesicle containing statoliths (dense particles) that stimulate sensory hairs (cilia) when the animal moves, allowing it to sense its orientation in the water. | Example: The ctenocyst of *Pleurobrachia* is a relatively simple structure.  The ctenocyst helps the comb jelly maintain its equilibrium. |近义词: statocyst (though less specific)|反义词: N/A

USAGE->

Before the experiment, they had prepared the ctenocyst for observation. = 实验前，他们已准备好观察栉胞囊。
The ctenophore had lost its balance because its ctenocyst was damaged. = 栉水母失去平衡是因为它的栉胞囊受损了。


将来时:
We will analyze the ctenocyst using advanced microscopy. = 我们将使用先进的显微镜分析栉胞囊。
Further research will reveal more details about the ctenocyst's mechanism. = 进一步的研究将揭示更多关于栉胞囊机制的细节。


虚拟语气:
If the ctenocyst were damaged, the animal would lose its balance. = 如果栉胞囊受损，动物就会失去平衡。

被动语态:
The ctenocyst's function was explained in the lecture. = 讲座中解释了栉胞囊的功能。
The ctenocyst is being studied by many marine biologists. = 许多海洋生物学家正在研究栉胞囊。


疑问句:
How does the ctenocyst work? = 栉胞囊是如何工作的？
What is the role of the statoliths in the ctenocyst? = 平衡石在栉胞囊中起什么作用？


否定句:
The ctenocyst did not respond to the subtle changes in orientation. = 栉胞囊没有对细微的方向变化做出反应。
The experiment did not reveal any new information about the ctenocyst's development. = 实验没有揭示关于栉胞囊发育的任何新信息。
