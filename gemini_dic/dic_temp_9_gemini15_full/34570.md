词源:
The word "cleared" comes from the Old English word "clēorian," meaning "to cleanse, purify."  This root is related to other words like "clean" and "clear."  The modern meaning evolved gradually, encompassing both the physical act of removing obstructions and the figurative sense of removing doubt or suspicion.
