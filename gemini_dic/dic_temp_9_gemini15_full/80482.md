gonozooid:/ˌɡɒnəˈzɔɪd/| n. |生殖个体，生殖体|A gonozooid is an individual zooid in a colonial organism (like a hydrozoan) that is specialized for sexual reproduction.  It produces gametes (sperm or eggs) which fuse to form a zygote, initiating a new generation. |Example: The colony produced numerous gonozooids during the breeding season.  该群体在繁殖季节产生了大量的生殖个体。|近义词： reproductive zooid |反义词：dactylozooid (feeding zooid), gastrozooid (feeding zooid)


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in zoology and biology, therefore its usage in different tenses is context-dependent and less frequently encountered in everyday speech.  Examples below are illustrative of how the word might be used in scientific writing.


一般现在时:
The gonozooid develops gonads. = 生殖个体发育出性腺。
The gonozooid releases gametes. = 生殖个体释放配子。


一般过去时:
The gonozooid produced numerous eggs last year. = 去年该生殖个体产下了许多卵。
The researcher observed the gonozooid's development. = 研究人员观察了生殖个体的发育。


现在完成时:
The colony has produced many gonozooids this season. = 这个群体本季已经产生了许多生殖个体。
Scientists have studied the genetics of this gonozooid. = 科学家们已经研究了该生殖个体的遗传学。


过去完成时:
Before the observation, the gonozooid had already released its gametes. = 观察之前，生殖个体已经释放了它的配子。
The gonozooid had undergone significant changes before maturation. = 生殖个体在成熟之前经历了显著的变化。


将来时:
The gonozooid will release its gametes soon. = 生殖个体很快就会释放它的配子。
Researchers predict that the gonozooid will develop rapidly. = 研究人员预测该生殖个体将快速发育。


虚拟语气:
If the gonozooid were larger, it would produce more gametes. = 如果生殖个体更大，它就会产生更多的配子。
It is crucial that the gonozooid develop correctly. = 生殖个体正确发育至关重要。


被动语态:
The gonozooids were observed under a microscope. = 生殖个体在显微镜下被观察。
The gonozooid's development is influenced by environmental factors. = 生殖个体的发育受环境因素影响。


疑问句:
How many gonozooids are present in the colony? = 群体中存在多少生殖个体？
What triggers the development of the gonozooid? = 什么触发了生殖个体的发育？


否定句:
The gonozooid did not produce any gametes this year. = 今年该生殖个体没有产生任何配子。
The colony does not have enough gonozooids for successful reproduction. = 该群体没有足够的生殖个体来成功繁殖。



PHRASE->
