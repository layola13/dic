词源:  The word "nonvitalities" is a relatively modern coinage, formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the plural noun "vitalities."  "Vitality" itself derives from the Latin word "vitalitas," meaning "liveliness, vigor."  Therefore, "nonvitalities" literally means "the absence or lack of vitalities."
