heptahedra:/ˌheptəˈhiːdrə/| n. |七面体 |A heptahedron is a three-dimensional geometric shape with seven faces.  It can take various forms, and not all heptahedra are regular (having all faces congruent and all angles equal).|Example:  The crystal displayed a complex heptahedral structure.  这个晶体展现了一个复杂的七面体结构。|近义词：seven-sided solid (less precise)|反义词：无


USAGE->

They had never seen such a complex heptahedron before. = 他们以前从未见过如此复杂的七面体。


将来时:
We will construct a heptahedron in the next lesson. = 我们将在下一节课制作一个七面体。
The architects will use heptahedral shapes in their design. = 建筑师们将在他们的设计中使用七面体形状。


虚拟语气:
If it were a regular heptahedron, all its faces would be congruent. = 如果它是一个正七面体，它的所有面都将是全等的。

疑问句:
Is this a regular heptahedron? = 这是一个正七面体吗？
How many vertices does a heptahedron have? = 一个七面体有多少个顶点？


否定句:
That shape is not a heptahedron; it has eight faces. = 那个形状不是七面体；它有八个面。
The model didn't accurately represent a heptahedron. = 这个模型没有准确地代表一个七面体。
