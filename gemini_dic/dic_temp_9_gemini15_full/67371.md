extensometer:/ɪkˈstɛnsəˌmiːtər/| n. |伸长计；引伸计|An instrument for measuring the elongation or extension of a material under stress.  It is commonly used in materials science and engineering to determine the mechanical properties of materials, such as tensile strength and elasticity.|例句：The extensometer precisely measured the strain on the steel beam during the tensile test.  伸长计精确测量了钢梁在拉伸试验中的应变。 The engineer used an extensometer to monitor the elongation of the bridge cable. 工程师用伸长计监测桥梁缆索的伸长。|近义词：strain gauge, elongation meter|反义词：None specifically, but instruments measuring compression would be antonymous in function.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The extensometer measures the elongation of the material. = 伸长计测量材料的伸长量。
We use an extensometer to monitor the strain. = 我们使用伸长计来监测应变。


一般过去时:
The extensometer measured the deformation accurately. = 伸长计精确地测量了变形。
The engineers used an extensometer yesterday. = 工程师昨天使用了伸长计。


现在完成时:
The extensometer has provided valuable data. = 伸长计提供了宝贵的数据。
Scientists have used extensometers for decades. = 科学家们几十年来一直在使用伸长计。


过去完成时:
The test had already begun before the extensometer was connected. = 在连接伸长计之前，测试已经开始了。
They had calibrated the extensometer prior to the experiment. = 他们在实验前校准了伸长计。


将来时:
We will use a new extensometer for the next test. = 我们将在下一次测试中使用新的伸长计。
The researchers will install the extensometer tomorrow. = 研究人员明天将安装伸长计。


虚拟语气:
If we had a more precise extensometer, the results would be better. = 如果我们有一个更精确的伸长计，结果会更好。
I wish we had used a different extensometer. = 我希望我们使用了不同的伸长计。


被动语态:
The elongation was measured by the extensometer. = 伸长量由伸长计测量。
The extensometer is being calibrated now. = 伸长计正在校准。


疑问句:
What type of extensometer are you using? = 你正在使用哪种类型的伸长计？
Is the extensometer properly calibrated? = 伸长计是否已正确校准？


否定句:
The extensometer did not detect any significant elongation. = 伸长计未检测到任何明显的伸长。
We did not have the appropriate extensometer for that test. = 我们没有适合该测试的伸长计。


PHRASE->
extensometer reading = 伸长计读数
optical extensometer = 光学伸长计
electrical extensometer = 电测伸长计
extensometer calibration = 伸长计校准
clip-on extensometer = 卡式伸长计
