The error in "maths's":

The word "maths" is already a shortened form of "mathematics."  Possessive forms are made by adding an apostrophe.  For words ending in 's',  you can either add an apostrophe only ('s) or an apostrophe and an 's' ('s').  Since "maths" ends in 's', the possessive is simply  **maths'**, not "maths's".  Adding another 's' is grammatically incorrect.
