dynametrical: /ˌdaɪnəˈmɛtrɪkəl/ | adj. | 动力学的；力的；能量的 | Relating to dynamics or force; characterized by energy or power.  | The dynametrical analysis revealed a significant imbalance in the engine's power output. 动力学分析揭示了发动机动力输出存在显著的不平衡。 |  energetic, powerful | static, weak | 形容词


USAGE->
This word is quite rare and doesn't have common usage examples across different tenses like "what".  The grammatical usage depends on the sentence it's used in.  Examples will illustrate its adjectival function.


一般现在时:
The dynametrical properties of the material are being tested. = 正在测试该材料的动力学特性。
This engine exhibits excellent dynametrical performance. = 这台发动机表现出优异的动力性能。


一般过去时:
The dynametrical analysis revealed a critical flaw. = 动力学分析揭示了一个严重缺陷。
Scientists studied the dynametrical effects of the explosion. = 科学家们研究了爆炸的动力学效应。


现在完成时:
Engineers have completed the dynametrical simulations. = 工程师们已经完成了动力学模拟。
Researchers have observed significant dynametrical changes. = 研究人员已经观察到显著的动力学变化。


过去完成时:
The dynametrical calculations had been completed before the launch. = 发射前动力学计算已经完成。
They had underestimated the dynametrical forces involved. = 他们低估了所涉及的动力学力。


将来时:
We will conduct further dynametrical experiments next week. = 我们下周将进行进一步的动力学实验。
The results of the dynametrical tests will be crucial. = 动力学测试的结果将至关重要。


虚拟语气:
If the dynametrical system were more efficient, we would achieve better results. = 如果动力系统效率更高，我们将获得更好的结果。
It's essential that the dynametrical properties be accurately measured. = 准确测量动力学特性至关重要。


被动语态:

疑问句:
Are the dynametrical characteristics suitable for this application? = 这些动力学特性适合此应用吗？
What are the key dynametrical parameters to consider? = 需要考虑的关键动力学参数是什么？


否定句:
The results were not consistent with the predicted dynametrical behavior. = 结果与预测的动力学行为不一致。
The system did not exhibit the expected dynametrical response. = 该系统没有表现出预期的动力学响应。


PHRASE->
Because "dynametrical" is a relatively uncommon word,  phrase usage is highly context-dependent.  Common phrases would need to be built around the word, rather than existing as pre-made phrases.  For example:

dynametrical analysis = 动力学分析
dynametrical properties = 动力学特性
dynametrical system = 动力学系统
dynametrical model = 动力学模型
dynametrical effects = 动力学效应
