词源:
The word "dishevel" comes from the Old French word "descheveler," which literally means "to un-comb the hair"  It combines the prefix "des-" (meaning "un-," "away from," or "reverse") with "chevel" (meaning "hair").  The evolution reflects a shift from specifically referring to hair to a broader sense of disarray and untidiness.
