词源:  The word "secularity" comes from the Latin word "saecularis," meaning "of this world," "worldly," or "temporal."  It's related to the Latin word "saeculum," meaning "age," "generation," or "world."  The transition from "saecularis" to "secularity" reflects a shift in emphasis from the temporal aspects of an age to the broader concept of separation from religious influence.
