词源:  The word is a compound of "re-" (again, anew) and "education" (the process of receiving or giving systematic instruction).  The prefix "re-" indicates a repetition or renewal of the process of education, but with a distinct ideological purpose in the context of "re-education".  The modern usage often carries a negative connotation, stemming from its association with totalitarian regimes using forced ideological conversion.
