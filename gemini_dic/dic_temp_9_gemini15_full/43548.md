词源:

The word "crayoning" is derived directly from the noun "crayon," which itself has a complex etymology. The word "crayon" entered English from French, where it ultimately derives from the Old French *craion, meaning "chalk," "crayon," or "pencil."  The ultimate origin is likely from the Latin word *creta, meaning "chalk."  Thus, "crayoning" signifies the act of drawing or painting with a chalk-like material.
