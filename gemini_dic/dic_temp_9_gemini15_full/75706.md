词源:

The word is derived from "full-blooded," which itself combines "full" (meaning complete or entire) and "blooded" (referring to bloodline or ancestry, often implying purity of breed).  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun signifying the state or quality of being full-blooded.  The final "-es" indicates the plural form.
