词源：The origin is uncertain, but it's likely a blend of "colic" (a type of stomach pain) and "wobbles" (a shaking or unsteady movement).  The exact etymology remains obscure, with no definitive historical record tracing its precise origins.  The word's playful and somewhat whimsical nature suggests a folk etymology, meaning its origin is more likely based on sound and association rather than a direct historical lineage.
