词源:

The word "newsworthinesses" is derived from "newsworthiness," which is a combination of "news" and "worthiness."

"News" comes from Old English "nyws," meaning "new things" or "tidings."

"Worthiness" comes from "worthy," ultimately from Old English "weorþ" meaning "value, worth."  The suffix "-ness" forms a noun indicating a state or quality.


Therefore, "newsworthiness" signifies the quality of being worthy of news coverage, and "newsworthinesses" is the plural form, referring to multiple instances or aspects of this quality.
