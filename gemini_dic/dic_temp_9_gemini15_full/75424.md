词源:

The word "fruit" comes from the Old French word "fruit," which in turn derives from the Latin word "fructus," meaning "enjoyment, profit, produce," ultimately from the verb "frui," meaning "to enjoy."  The semantic shift from "enjoyment" to "produce" to "fruit" reflects the value placed on the edible produce of plants.
