词源:
The word "racker" originates from the verb "rack," which has a long history and various meanings.  One meaning, relevant to the "crane operator" sense, relates to stretching or straining, as in "to rack one's brains."  The association with cranes comes from the action of stretching or straining to lift heavy objects.  The "robber/extortionist" meaning likely derives from a figurative use of "rack," implying the act of extorting or twisting something (like money) from someone. The exact etymology of the specific meaning of "racker" as a crane operator needs further historical linguistic research.
