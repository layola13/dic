词源:

The word "reanointing" is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning again or anew) and the word "anointing," which derives from the Old English "anoint,"  itself from Old French  "enoindre," ultimately from Latin "unguere" (to anoint). The original meaning was the act of applying oil, often in a religious context, to consecrate or dedicate something or someone.  The addition of "re-" signifies a repetition or renewal of this act.
