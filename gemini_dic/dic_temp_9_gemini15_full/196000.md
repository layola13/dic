词源:
The word "sentimentalism" comes from the adjective "sentimental," which itself derives from the French word "sentimental," ultimately from the Latin word "sentire," meaning "to feel." The "-ism" suffix indicates a doctrine, system, or practice.  Therefore, sentimentalism literally refers to a system or practice based on feeling.
