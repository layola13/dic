词源:  The word "lanky" likely originated in the early 19th century. Its exact etymology is uncertain, but it's possibly related to the Old English word "lanc," meaning "long," and the Middle English word "lanke," also meaning "long" or "slender."  The -y suffix added to "lanc" or "lanke" likely contributed to the word's development into its current descriptive form.
