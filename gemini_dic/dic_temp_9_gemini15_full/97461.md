ing: /ɪŋ/ | suffix | 动名词后缀，现在分词后缀 |  表示动作或状态正在进行，也可用作名词 |

英文解析: "-ing" is a suffix added to verbs to form present participles (used in continuous tenses) and gerunds (used as nouns).  As a present participle, it describes an ongoing action. As a gerund, it functions nominally, often as the subject or object of a verb.


例句:

Present Participle (Ongoing Action):
He is singing a song. = 他正在唱歌。

She was reading a book. = 她正在看书。


Gerund (Noun Function):
Swimming is my favorite sport. = 游泳是我最喜欢的运动。

I enjoy cooking. = 我喜欢烹饪。


近义词:  (depending on context)  -ing forms don't have direct synonyms, but the meaning can be conveyed differently with other verb forms or nouns.


反义词:  (depending on context) No direct antonyms, as "-ing" describes an ongoing state.  The opposite would be expressed by using a different tense or verb.


词性:  Suffix (后缀)  It is not a word itself, but a grammatical element attached to verbs.
