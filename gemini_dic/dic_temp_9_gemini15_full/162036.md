pre-acidness's:/ˌpriːˈæsɪdnəsɪz/| n. |酸度之前的，酸性之前的状态|The term "pre-acidness's" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a non-standard creation attempting to describe a state before something becomes acidic.  It combines the prefix "pre-" (meaning before) with "acidness" (the state of being acidic) and adds the possessive 's.  The grammatical construction is unusual and likely incorrect.  A more appropriate term would depend on the specific context.  For example, one might use "pre-acidification" or a phrase such as "the state before acidification."|例句：The study analyzed the pre-acidness's of the soil samples. (Incorrect usage, should be revised)|近义词:pre-acidification, earlier state, antecedent condition|反义词:acidity, post-acidification
