The word "lezzy" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a slang term, a misspelling, or a word from a very niche dialect.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  To provide a response, I would need more context on where you encountered this word.
