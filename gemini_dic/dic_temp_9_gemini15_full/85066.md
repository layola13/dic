Etymology:  The word is a compound of "hard" (meaning firm, unyielding, or severe) and "faced" (meaning having a particular kind of face).  The meaning derives directly from the literal description of a face appearing hard or unyielding in expression.  There's no specific historical etymology beyond this straightforward compounding.
