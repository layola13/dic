词源：

The word "nonfelicitous" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "felicitous."  "Felicitous" comes from the Latin word "felix," meaning "lucky" or "happy," and ultimately relates to the idea of something being well-chosen and appropriate.  Therefore, "nonfelicitous" literally means "not lucky" or "not happy" in the sense of not being well-suited or appropriate.
