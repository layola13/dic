The word "over-objected" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a non-standard combination of "over-" (a prefix indicating excess or to a great extent) and "objected" (the past tense of the verb "to object").  Therefore, a full etymological breakdown and grammatical analysis in the requested format is not possible.  However, we can analyze the components individually and discuss how one might interpret its intended meaning.


over-/ˈoʊvər/ | prefix |过度，超过，在…之上 | Indicates excess, exceeding a limit, or above something. |  The price was overcharged. (价格被收高了) |  under- |  under-


objected/əbˈdʒɛktɪd/ | v. |反对，提出异议| Past tense of "to object," meaning to express disapproval or opposition. | He objected to the proposal. (他反对这个提议) |  agreed, approved | accepted

If someone were to use "over-objected," it would likely imply that someone objected excessively or to an unreasonable degree,  perhaps going beyond what was necessary or appropriate.  For example, one might say (though it's grammatically awkward):  "He over-objected to the minor typo in the report."  A better way to phrase this would be "He objected excessively to the minor typo in the report" or "He raised excessive objections to the minor typo in the report."
