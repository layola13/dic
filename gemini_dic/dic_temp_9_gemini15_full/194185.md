词源:
The word "self-issuing" is a compound adjective formed from "self" (meaning "of or by oneself") and "issuing" (the present participle of the verb "to issue," meaning "to give out officially or formally").  Therefore, "self-issuing" literally means "issued by oneself."  The term reflects the autonomous nature of the process, where no external authority is needed for validation.
