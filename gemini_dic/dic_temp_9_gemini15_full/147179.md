overlusciousnesses: /ˌoʊvərˈlʌʃəsˌnɛsɪz/ | n. | 过分甜美；过度华丽；甜美过剩 |  The word "overlusciousnesses" is a rare and somewhat contrived word, formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively) to the plural of "lusciousness."  It refers to instances or qualities of excessive sweetness, richness, or luxuriousness, often to an unpleasant or cloying degree.  The word highlights the abundance of something pleasurable to the point of being overwhelming.  Because of its rarity, finding examples in common usage is difficult. The word itself is more likely to be found in creative writing or academic discussions of language. |  Example: The overlusciousnesses of the dessert buffet left many guests feeling nauseous. (甜点自助餐的甜美过剩让许多客人感到恶心。) | 近义词: excesses, superfluities, overindulgences | 反义词: austerity, plainness, simplicity |  名词
