词源:

The word "collarbone" is a compound word.  "Collar" refers to the band around the neck,  and "bone" refers to the skeletal structure. The name is descriptive of the bone's location near the collar.  "Clavicle," the medical term, comes from the Latin word *clavicula*, a diminutive of *clavis*, meaning "key," likely referring to its shape and function as a pivotal bone in the shoulder girdle.
