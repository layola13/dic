USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "what" does.  Therefore, tense variations (past, present, future, etc.) don't apply to "semidirectness" itself.  However, we can show how it's used in different sentence structures:

PHRASE->
The word "semidirectness" itself doesn't typically form common phrases in the same way as "what".  Phrases using it would be built around the concept of indirect/subtle communication.  Here are some example sentence structures incorporating "semidirectness":
