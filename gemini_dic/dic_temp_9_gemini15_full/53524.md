Word Origin:

The word "disastrousnesses" is derived from the adjective "disastrous," which itself comes from the noun "disaster."  "-ness" is a suffix added to adjectives to create nouns signifying a state, quality, or condition.  Therefore, "disastrousnesses" represents the state or condition of being disastrous, specifically referring to the collective nature of numerous disastrous events or their overall impact.  "Disaster" ultimately derives from Old French *desastre, from Old Italian *disastro, literally "ill-starred," from dis- "ill, badly" + astro "star."  The original sense related to unfavorable astrological influences.
