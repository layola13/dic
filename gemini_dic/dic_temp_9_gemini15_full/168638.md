procollegiate: /ˌproʊkəˈliːdʒiət/ | adj. |  大学预科的；大学预备的 | Relating to or characteristic of the period of education preceding college.  This word is rarely used and considered somewhat archaic or informal. It suggests preparation for college, but not necessarily in a formal or structured pre-college program.


英文解析:  The word combines "pro-" (meaning "before" or "in favor of") and "collegiate" (relating to college). Therefore, it literally means "before college" or "in support of college." However, its usage is limited and often implies the period of education leading up to college, encompassing high school and possibly some preparatory programs.


例句:

He engaged in procollegiate activities, hoping to impress college admissions officers. 他参与了大学预科活动，希望能给大学招生官留下好印象。

Her procollegiate studies focused heavily on standardized test preparation. 她的大学预科学习主要集中在标准化考试的准备上。
