词源:
The name "lidocaine" is a combination of the chemical structure (a substituted amide of xylidine) and the suffix "-caine," which is commonly used to denote local anesthetics.  The "lido-" component likely refers to its relation to xylidine derivatives.  It is a coined word rather than having a direct etymology from classical roots.
