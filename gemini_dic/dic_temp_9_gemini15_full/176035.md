词源:
The word "ravelly" derives from the verb "ravel," which ultimately originates from the Old French word "raveler," meaning "to entangle."  The Old French word in turn has roots in the Old Norse word "refla," meaning "to twist or tangle."  The "-ly" suffix transforms the verb into an adjective describing a state or quality.
