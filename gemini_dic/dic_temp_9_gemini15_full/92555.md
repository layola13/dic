hysteresis:/ˌhɪstəˈriːsɪs/| n. |滞后现象；磁滞；回滞|The dependence of the state of a system (as a ferromagnet) on its history.  Specifically, the lagging of an effect behind its cause. For example, in magnetism, the magnetic flux density (B) does not trace the same path as the applied magnetic field strength (H) increases and then decreases. This phenomenon is a result of the magnetic domains in the material not immediately aligning themselves with the applied field and remaining partially aligned even after the field has been removed.  Another example is the temperature of a material. When heating and cooling, the temperature will not follow the same path due to thermal inertia. |例句：The hysteresis loop shows the relationship between magnetization and magnetic field strength. 磁滞回线显示了磁化强度和磁场强度之间的关系。

The hysteresis effect is often seen in materials with memory, such as ferromagnetic materials. 磁滞效应通常出现在具有记忆效应的材料中，例如铁磁材料。


近义词：lag, delay, retardation |反义词：immediate response, instantaneous reaction |词性：名词
