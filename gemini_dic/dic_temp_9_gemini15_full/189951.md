词源:
The word "sanctimonial" is derived from the word "sanctimony," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "sanctimonia," meaning "holiness" or "piety."  The suffix "-al" transforms the noun into an adjective.  However, the modern usage of "sanctimonial," and its related word "sanctimonious," carries a strongly negative connotation, implying insincerity and hypocrisy in the display of religious devotion.
