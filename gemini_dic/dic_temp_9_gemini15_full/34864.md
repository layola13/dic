clinopinacoid:/ˌklɪnoʊˈpɪnəkɔɪd/| n. |斜柱面|A clinopinacoid is a crystallographic form that consists of two parallel faces that are inclined to the crystallographic axes.  It's a type of pinacoid, characterized by its inclined orientation.  Clinopinacoids are commonly observed in monoclinic and triclinic crystal systems.|The mineral gypsum often exhibits a well-developed clinopinacoid.|近义词:pinacoid (a broader term)|反义词:orthopinacoid (a pinacoid perpendicular to an axis)|名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in crystallography and mineralogy, not in everyday conversation.  Therefore, typical grammatical structures are less relevant.  The following examples illustrate its usage in scientific writing:

一般现在时:
The clinopinacoid is a defining characteristic of this mineral. = 斜柱面是这种矿物的决定性特征。
Clinopinacoids often reflect light differently than other crystal faces. = 斜柱面通常比其他晶面反射光线的方式不同。


一般过去时:
The clinopinacoid was identified using X-ray diffraction. = 使用 X 射线衍射鉴定了斜柱面。
We observed a well-developed clinopinacoid on the sample. = 我们在样品上观察到一个发育良好的斜柱面。


现在完成时:
Geologists have identified many minerals with prominent clinopinacoids. = 地质学家已经鉴定了许多具有突出斜柱面的矿物。
Researchers have used clinopinacoid angles to classify different mineral species. = 研究人员利用斜柱面角来对不同的矿物种类进行分类。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, the clinopinacoid had been carefully cleaned. = 在分析之前，斜柱面已被仔细清洁。
Scientists had determined that the crystal structure included a clinopinacoid before further study. = 科学家在进一步研究之前已经确定晶体结构包含一个斜柱面。


将来时:
We will analyze the clinopinacoid using electron microscopy. = 我们将使用电子显微镜分析斜柱面。
The study will show the significance of the clinopinacoid in the mineral's formation. = 这项研究将展示斜柱面在矿物形成中的重要性。


被动语态:
The clinopinacoid was measured with a goniometer. = 斜柱面是用测角仪测量的。
The crystal structure was identified as containing a clinopinacoid. = 晶体结构被鉴定为包含一个斜柱面。
