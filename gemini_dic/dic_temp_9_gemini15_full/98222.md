词源：

The word "insecurities" is derived from the adjective "insecure," which itself comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "secure."  "Secure" ultimately traces back to the Latin word "securus," meaning "free from care," "safe," or "trustworthy."  Therefore, "insecure" means "not safe" or "lacking confidence," and "insecurities" refers to the state or instances of feeling this way.
