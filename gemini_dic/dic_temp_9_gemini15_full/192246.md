词源:
The word "scream" comes from the Old English word "scrīman," which meant "to cry out," "to shriek," or "to shout."  This word itself has roots in Proto-Germanic *skrīman-.  The modern English word has evolved over time to retain the sense of a loud and sharp cry, often associated with strong emotion.
