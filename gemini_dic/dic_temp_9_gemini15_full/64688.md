词源:

The word "escapement" comes from the verb "escape," ultimately derived from Old French *escaper (to escape, avoid), from Vulgar Latin *excappare, from Latin ex- ("out") + cappa ("cloak, hood"). The "-ment" suffix is a noun-forming suffix indicating an action or process.  The term refers to the controlled "escape" of energy in a clock mechanism.
