词源:

The word "overexaggeration" is a compound word formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively"), the word "exaggeration" (the act of exaggerating), which itself comes from the verb "exaggerate" (to represent something as larger, better, or worse than it really is).  "Exaggerate" comes from the Late Latin word *exagero*, itself from the Latin prefix *ex-* (out, beyond) and *ager*,  meaning "to bring out of" or "to increase".  The suffix "-ation" creates a noun form denoting an action or process.
