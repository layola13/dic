The word "ineligibilities" is derived from the adjective "ineligible," which is formed by adding the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") to "eligible."  "Eligible" comes from the Old French "eligible,"  ultimately from Latin "eligere" (to choose, select).  Therefore, "ineligibilities" refers to the states or conditions of being "not choosable" or "not qualified."
