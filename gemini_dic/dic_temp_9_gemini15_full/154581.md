WORD ORIGIN->

The word "persecutingly" is derived from the verb "persecute," which comes from the Late Latin word "persequi," meaning "to follow after, pursue, prosecute."  The "per-" prefix means "through" or "thoroughly," and the "-sequi" root means "to follow." Thus, the original meaning implied a thorough and relentless pursuit, which over time evolved to encompass the sense of unjust and oppressive pursuit, leading to its current meaning of persecution.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective "persecuting" into an adverb, modifying verbs and describing the manner in which an action is performed.
