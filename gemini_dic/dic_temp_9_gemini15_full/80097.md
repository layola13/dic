gobbetly: /ˈɡɑːbɪtli/ | adj. |支离破碎的，不成形的；混乱的 |  The word "gobbetly" is not found in standard English dictionaries. It appears to be a nonce word, meaning a word coined for a specific occasion and not in common usage.  It likely derives from the word "gobbet," meaning a small lump or piece, suggesting a state of being fragmented or disordered. The "-ly" suffix transforms it into an adjective.  Therefore, it describes something that is haphazard, shapeless, or in a state of disarray.  | 例句：The instructions were gobbetly and confusing.  说明书支离破碎，令人费解。 The garden was left in a gobbetly state after the storm.  暴风雨过后，花园一片狼藉。 | 近义词：chaotic, disordered, jumbled, haphazard, disorganized | 反义词：organized, orderly, neat, coherent |  adj.
