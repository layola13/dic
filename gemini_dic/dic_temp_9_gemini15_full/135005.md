nonnegativities:/ˌnɒnˌneɡəˈtɪvətiz/| n. |非负性；非负数；非负值|The property of being non-negative; the state of having a value greater than or equal to zero.  This term is often used in mathematics, particularly in linear programming and optimization problems where variables or constraints are restricted to non-negative values.|Example: The nonnegativities of the variables are crucial constraints in this optimization model.  非负性是此优化模型中的关键约束条件。  The algorithm requires the input data to satisfy the condition of nonnegativities. 该算法要求输入数据满足非负性条件。|近义词：positivity (in some contexts)|反义词：negativities|名词
