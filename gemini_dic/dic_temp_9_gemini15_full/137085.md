The word "nonstudies" does not exist as a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need to understand the intended meaning.  Was it perhaps meant to be one of the following?

* **Non-studies:** This would be a compound word referring to things that are *not* studies or academic pursuits.  This would be an adjective phrase modifying a noun.

* **Non-study:** This would refer to a single instance of something that is not a study or academic pursuit.  This could be a noun or an adjective depending on context.
