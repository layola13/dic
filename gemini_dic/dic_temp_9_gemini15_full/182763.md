WORD ORIGIN->
The word "repast" comes from the Old French word "repast," which itself originates from the Latin word "repastus," the past participle of the verb "repascere," meaning "to feed again."  The prefix "re-" implies repetition or renewal, suggesting the act of refilling or replenishing oneself with food.
