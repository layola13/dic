cellulosing: /ˌsɛljuˈloʊsɪŋ/ | n. |纤维素化；纤维素处理|The process of treating materials with cellulose or converting them into cellulose derivatives.  It involves various chemical and physical processes depending on the desired outcome.  The term is less common than its related processes, like cellulose production or cellulose modification. |例句：The research focuses on improving the cellulosing process to create more sustainable materials. = 这项研究的重点是改进纤维素化工艺，以创造更可持续的材料。

The company developed a novel method of cellulosing agricultural waste into biofuel. =该公司开发了一种将农业废弃物纤维素化成生物燃料的新方法。

近义词：cellulose treatment, cellulose modification |反义词：There is no direct antonym, but  processes that break down cellulose (like enzymatic hydrolysis) could be considered opposite in a functional sense.
