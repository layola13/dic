词源:

The word "concerted" comes from the past participle of the verb "concert," meaning "to arrange or plan together," which in turn is derived from the Old French word "concerter," meaning "to agree," "to harmonize."  The ultimate origin lies in the Latin word "con," meaning "together," and "certare," meaning "to strive" or "to contend."  Thus, the original sense implied a coming together in striving towards a common goal.
