词源:

The word "minuscule" comes from the Late Latin word *minuscula, the diminutive of *minus 'less'.  The diminutive suffix *-cula indicates smallness.  It ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *mei- "small." The shift to refer specifically to lowercase letters occurred later, reflecting the smaller size of those letters compared to majuscules (uppercase).
