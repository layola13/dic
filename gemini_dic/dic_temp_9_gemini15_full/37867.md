词源:
The word "compliment" comes from the French word "compliment," which ultimately derives from the Latin "complere," meaning "to complete" or "to fill up."  Initially, it meant "to complete" or "to fulfill," but its meaning shifted over time to reflect the idea of completing or enhancing something, such as someone's self-esteem through praise.
