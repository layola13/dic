词源:

The word is a relatively modern coinage, combining "drawing-room" (a formal sitting room, originating in the 18th century from the practice of withdrawing to a private room for conversation and entertainment) with the suffix "-y," which creates adjectives indicating a quality or characteristic (as in "roomy").  Therefore, it builds upon existing vocabulary to create a new descriptive term.
