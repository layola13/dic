quasi-prejudiced: /ˈkwɑːzaɪ ˈprɛdʒʊdɪst/ | adj. |准偏见；似偏见；潜在偏见 |

英文解析：Quasi-prejudiced describes attitudes or beliefs that resemble prejudice but may not fully meet the criteria of outright prejudice.  It suggests a predisposition or bias that falls short of fully developed or overtly expressed prejudice.  It might involve subtle biases, unconscious stereotypes, or microaggressions that, while not necessarily malicious, still contribute to discrimination or inequality.
