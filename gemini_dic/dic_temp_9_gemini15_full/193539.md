self-adjoint:/ˌsɛlfˈædʒɔɪnt/| adj. |自伴随的，自共轭的 |  In mathematics, particularly in linear algebra and functional analysis, a self-adjoint operator (or Hermitian operator) is a linear operator that is its own adjoint.  This means that for any two vectors *x* and *y* in the vector space, the inner product of *Ax* and *y* is equal to the inner product of *x* and *Ay*. This property has significant implications for the operator's eigenvalues and eigenvectors, guaranteeing real eigenvalues and orthogonality of eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues.  Self-adjoint operators are crucial in quantum mechanics, where they represent observable physical quantities. | The Hamiltonian operator in quantum mechanics is a self-adjoint operator.  |近义词：Hermitian |反义词：non-self-adjoint


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in mathematical contexts, particularly within linear algebra and functional analysis. Therefore, standard grammatical tenses and sentence structures apply.  There aren't specific idiomatic uses in the same way as common words.  Examples will illustrate its use in different mathematical scenarios.


Example 1 (Simple Sentence):
The operator A is self-adjoint. = 算子A是自伴随的。


Example 2 (More Complex Sentence):
Because the operator is self-adjoint, its eigenvalues are real and its eigenvectors corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal. = 因为该算子是自伴随的，所以它的特征值是实数，并且对应于不同特征值的特征向量是正交的。



Example 3 (Passive Voice):
The existence of a self-adjoint extension is guaranteed under certain conditions. = 在某些条件下，自伴随扩张的存在性是有保证的。


Example 4 (Conditional Sentence):
If the operator is self-adjoint, then the spectral theorem applies. = 如果算子是自伴随的，则谱定理适用。


PHRASE->
