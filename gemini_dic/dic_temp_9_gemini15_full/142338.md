orthogneiss: /ˈɔːrθoʊnaɪs/ | n. | 正片麻岩 | A high-grade metamorphic rock formed from the metamorphism of pre-existing igneous or sedimentary rocks, characterized by a well-developed, planar fabric.  It is typically composed of quartz, feldspar, and mica minerals, and exhibits a banded or gneissic texture. | The outcrop showed a beautiful example of orthogneiss, with distinct banding of light and dark minerals.  这处露头展示了一个美丽的正片麻岩例子，具有明显的明暗矿物条带。 |  gneiss, paragneiss | (no direct antonym, but could be contrasted with other metamorphic rocks like schist or slate based on metamorphic grade) | 名词
