The word "scoke" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Please double-check the spelling.
* **It's a dialect word or slang:**  It might be used in a very specific region or community.  If you can provide context (where you heard or saw it), it might be possible to identify it.
* **It's a newly coined word:**  While unlikely, it's possible it's a very recent invention.

To get the information you need, please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
