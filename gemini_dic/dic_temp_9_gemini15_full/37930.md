词源:
The word "completeness's" is derived from the adjective "complete" and the suffix "-ness", which transforms adjectives into nouns denoting a state or quality.  The possessive 's is added to further indicate that we're focusing on the *quality* of completeness, rather than simply the completeness itself.  "Complete" itself has roots in Latin, ultimately stemming from  the verb "complere," meaning "to fill up" or "to complete."
