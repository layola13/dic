词源:
The word "renegade" ultimately derives from the Spanish word "renegado," meaning "apostate," "renegade," or "one who has renounced his faith."  This, in turn, comes from the verb "renegar," meaning "to deny," which is related to the Latin "renegare," a compound of "re-" (again) and "negare" (to deny).  Therefore, the core meaning revolves around the act of denying or rejecting something previously held.
