词源:

The word "outwiggle" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning to surpass or exceed) and the verb "wiggle" (meaning to move with quick, short movements).  It's a relatively modern formation, likely arising from the common figurative use of "wiggle" to imply cunning or clever maneuvering.  There's no specific historical etymology tracing back to a particular time or source, as it's a naturally formed compound verb.
