词源：

From reproach (verb) + -ful (suffix).  Reproach ultimately derives from Old French *reprocher, from Latin reprobare "to disapprove, reject," from re- "back, again" + probare "to test, prove."


用法说明：

Reproachful is primarily used to describe a person's expression, tone, or manner. It suggests that the person is expressing disapproval or disappointment, often implicitly rather than through direct accusation.  It can also describe a situation or atmosphere as being charged with unspoken blame.


The word is typically used with nouns referring to looks, tones, silence, or atmosphere:

* reproachful look/glare/stare
* reproachful tone/voice/silence
* reproachful atmosphere/silence


It is less frequently used to describe a person directly as being "reproachful," although it is grammatically correct.  It is more natural to say someone "has a reproachful expression" or "spoke in a reproachful tone" than to simply say "He was reproachful."
