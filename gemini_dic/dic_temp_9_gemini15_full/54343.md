词源:
The word "disheveled" comes from the Old French word "descheveler," meaning "to dishevel," which in turn is composed of the prefix "des-" (meaning "to undo" or "to reverse") and "chevel" (meaning "hair").  Therefore, the original meaning directly related to the untangling or disarranging of hair.  Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass a more general state of untidiness.
