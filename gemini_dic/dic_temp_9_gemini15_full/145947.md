词源：

The word "overdiscriminating" is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to an excessive degree) and "discriminating" (meaning making distinctions or differentiations).  "Discriminating" itself comes from the Latin word "discriminare," meaning "to separate," "to distinguish," or "to discern."  The addition of "over-" adds the sense of  excessive or unfair distinction.
