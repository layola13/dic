词源:The origin is uncertain, but it is believed to be a playful combination of words, possibly onomatopoeic or imitative of a weak, childish voice.  One theory suggests it originated as a childish term of endearment, then evolved into a derogatory term.  There's no definitive etymological tracing back to a single source.
