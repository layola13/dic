词源:  The word "realworld" is a compound word formed from "real" and "world". "Real" comes from the Old French "real," meaning "royal," "kingly," which ultimately derives from the Latin "regalis," meaning "royal."  "World" comes from the Old English "worold," meaning "age," "time," "generation," related to the Proto-Germanic "*weraldaz".  The combination signifies the actual, existing world in contrast to something imagined or theoretical.
