hydrogalvanic: /ˌhaɪdroʊɡælˈvænɪk/ | adj. | 水电的；水电流的 | Relating to or involving the generation of electricity by the action of water on dissimilar metals.  This process is a form of corrosion where one metal acts as an anode and another as a cathode in an electrolyte (water). | Example: The hydrogalvanic corrosion of the pipeline was a significant concern.  管道的水电腐蚀是一个重要的关注点。| 近义词: electrochemical, galvanic | 反义词:  There isn't a direct antonym, but terms like "insulated," or descriptions of preventing electrochemical reactions could be considered contrasting concepts.
