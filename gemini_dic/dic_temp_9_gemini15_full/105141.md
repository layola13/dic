词源:The word "ketchup" has a long and interesting history, ultimately deriving from the Chinese word kê-tsiap (鮭汁), meaning "brine of pickled fish".  This term evolved through various forms in Southeast Asia and then into the Malay word kechap, which referred to a variety of fish sauces.  European traders encountered these sauces and brought them back to Europe, where the word and the concept of a fermented fish sauce spread. Over time, the recipe evolved, and the use of tomatoes in the sauce became prominent, leading to the modern ketchup we know today.
