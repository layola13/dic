metapophysis:/ˌmɛtəˈpɒfɪsɪs/| n. |后突 (解剖学)|The metapophysis is a bony process found on the vertebrae of some animals, particularly in the cervical and lumbar regions. It's an outgrowth from the transverse process, and its presence and development vary significantly across species.  It's primarily used in comparative anatomy studies to differentiate between different vertebrate species and their evolutionary relationships.|The metapophysis of the giraffe's neck vertebrae is exceptionally long and contributes to its distinctive neck length.|近义词：transverse process (部分情况下)|反义词：无|名词
