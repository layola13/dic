hectocotylus: /ˌhɛktoʊˈkɑɪtələs/ | n. | 触腕; 交接腕 |

英文解析:A hectocotylus is a modified arm of a male cephalopod (such as an octopus or squid) used for transferring spermatophores (packets of sperm) to the female during mating.  It is often highly specialized in structure and function, varying greatly among different cephalopod species.  In some species, the hectocotylus detaches from the male after transferring sperm.

例句:
The octopus uses its hectocotylus to deliver sperm to the female. = 章鱼用它的交接腕将精子输送至雌性。

The hectocotylus of this squid species is unusually large. = 这个鱿鱼物种的交接腕异常的大。


近义词: modified arm (though not a perfect synonym, as it's a specific type of modified arm)

反义词:  There isn't a direct antonym, as it refers to a specific anatomical structure.


词性: noun
