hemihedral:/ˌhɛmiˈhiːdrəl/| adj. |半面體的；半面的|Relating to or denoting a crystal system in which only half the faces normally present are developed.  It describes crystals that lack complete symmetry, displaying only half the expected faces. This is often due to the arrangement of atoms within the crystal structure. | Example:  The mineral showed hemihedral development of its crystal faces.  这个矿物显示出其晶面的半面体发育。|近义词：incomplete, partial|反义词：holohedral


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The mineral exhibits hemihedral forms. = 这种矿物呈现半面体形态。
Hemihedral crystals are often studied in crystallography. = 半面体晶体经常在结晶学中被研究。


一般过去时:
The researchers observed a hemihedral structure in the sample. = 研究人员在样本中观察到半面体结构。
The analysis revealed the crystal to be hemihedral. = 分析显示该晶体为半面体。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified many hemihedral crystals. = 科学家们已经鉴别出许多半面体晶体。
Crystallographers have long studied the properties of hemihedral forms. = 结晶学家长期以来一直在研究半面体形态的特性。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the crystal was believed to be holohedral. = 在发现之前，人们认为这种晶体是全面的。
They had not previously encountered such a pronounced hemihedral development. = 他们以前从未遇到过如此明显的半面体发育。


将来时:
Further research will investigate the causes of hemihedral development. = 后续研究将调查半面体发育的原因。
We will analyze the crystal to determine if it is hemihedral or holohedral. = 我们将分析晶体以确定它是半面体还是全面的。


虚拟语气:
If the crystal were perfectly formed, it would be holohedral. = 如果晶体完美形成，它将是全面的。
It would be helpful if we had a clearer image of the hemihedral faces. = 如果我们有更清晰的半面体晶面的图像，那将会有帮助。


被动语态:
The hemihedral crystal was carefully examined under a microscope. = 半面体晶体在显微镜下被仔细检查。
The cause of hemihedral development is still being investigated. = 半面体发育的原因仍在调查中。


疑问句:
Is this crystal hemihedral or holohedral? = 这个晶体是半面体还是全面的？
What factors influence hemihedral crystal growth? = 哪些因素影响半面体晶体的生长？


否定句:
The crystal does not exhibit typical hemihedral characteristics. = 该晶体不表现出典型的半面体特征。
This mineral is not considered to be hemihedral. = 这种矿物不被认为是半面体。
