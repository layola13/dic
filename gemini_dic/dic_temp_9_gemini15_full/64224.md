equimultiple:/ˈiːkwɪˈmʌltɪpl/| adj.| 等倍数的，成比例的 |An equimultiple is a multiple of a number that is also a multiple of another number by the same factor.| 例句：If 6 and 15 are equimultiples of 2 and 5 respectively, then they have a common multiple. 如果6和15分别是2和5的等倍数，那么它们有公倍数。|近义词：proportional, commensurate |反义词：disproportionate, incommensurable |


词源:

The word "equimultiple" is derived from the Latin prefix "equi-" meaning "equal," and the words "multi-" meaning "many" and "-ple" meaning "fold."  Therefore, it literally means "equal multiples."


用法说明:

Equimultiples are used in mathematics, particularly in number theory and geometry.  Two numbers are equimultiples if they are multiples of two other numbers by the same factor. For example, 12 and 18 are equimultiples of 2 and 3 because 12 = 6*2 and 18 = 6*3. The factor is 6 in this case.  The concept is related to the idea of proportionality and ratios.


例句:


1.  The lengths of the sides of the triangle are equimultiples of 3, 4, and 5. 三角形三边的长度是3, 4, 5的等倍数。

2.  Finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) often involves working with equimultiples. 寻找最大公约数(GCD)通常涉及使用等倍数。
