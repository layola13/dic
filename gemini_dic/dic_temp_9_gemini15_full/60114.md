词源：

The word "effacement" derives from the verb "efface," which comes from the Old French word "effacer," meaning "to wipe out," "to erase," or "to rub out."  The prefix "ef-" is a variant of "ex-," meaning "out" or "from," and "-face" is related to the Latin word "facies," meaning "face" or "form."  Thus, the original meaning literally referred to wiping something from the face or surface.
