词源:
The word "roughnecking" comes from the combination of "roughneck," a term for a tough, unskilled laborer, especially in the oil industry, and the suffix "-ing," indicating the act of doing something.  The term "roughneck" itself is believed to have originated in the late 19th or early 20th century, with roots possibly in the general sense of "rough" and "neck," perhaps suggesting a strong, brawny individual.
