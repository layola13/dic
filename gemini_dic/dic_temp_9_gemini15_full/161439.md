词源:

The word "posy" comes from the Middle English word "posie," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "poësie."  While "poësie" meant "poetry" in Old French, its use shifted in Middle English to refer to a short, inscribed poem, often found on a ring,  or a small bunch of flowers. The modern meaning of "posy" referring primarily to a small bunch of flowers emerged later.
