词源:
The word "gullible" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "gullen," meaning "to swallow," often in the sense of accepting something without question.  This in turn may be related to Old French words related to "gullet" (throat).  The modern meaning of readily believing something untrue evolved over time, reflecting the idea of readily "swallowing" false information.
