词源：

The word "ruthless" originates from the Old English word "reoth," meaning "compassion" or "pity."  The addition of the prefix "ruth-"  (meaning "pity" or "mercy"), followed by the suffix "-less" (meaning "without"), created the word "ruthless," signifying "without pity" or "without mercy."  The meaning thus evolved into its current sense of being merciless and cruel.
