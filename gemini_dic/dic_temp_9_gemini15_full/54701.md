词源:
The word "disorient" comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away from" or "the opposite of") and the verb "orient," which originally meant "to locate with respect to the cardinal points of the compass" (East, West, North, South).  The word "orient" ultimately comes from the Latin word "oriens," meaning "rising," referring to the rising sun in the East.  Therefore, "disorient" literally means "to remove from a proper orientation" or "to lose one's bearings."
