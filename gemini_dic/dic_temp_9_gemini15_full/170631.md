The term "pseudo-Italians" is a compound word combining "pseudo-" and "Italians".

* **pseudo-**:  /ˈsuːdoʊ/ | prefix |假，伪 | This prefix derives from the Greek word "pseudēs" (ψευδής), meaning "false" or "lying".  It indicates something that is false, spurious, or counterfeit.

* **Italians**: /ɪˈtæliənz/ | n. |意大利人 | This is the plural form of "Italian", referring to a person from Italy.  Its etymology traces back to the Latin word "Italia", the name of the Italian peninsula.


The term carries a negative connotation, implying that the individuals in question are falsely representing themselves as Italian or are only superficially engaging with Italian culture.  It is important to note that this term can be considered offensive and should be used with caution, if at all.  There is no established positive synonym, and antonyms would depend on the specific context (e.g., "genuine Italians," "authentic Italians").
