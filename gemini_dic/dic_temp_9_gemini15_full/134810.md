词源:  The word "nonmilitant" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "militant," which derives from the Latin word "militans," the present participle of "militare," meaning "to serve as a soldier."  Therefore, "nonmilitant" literally means "not serving as a soldier" or "not warlike."
