The word "parsavalik" is not a word in standard English or any widely recognized language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps a similar-sounding or related word exists.
* **It's a word from a less common language:**  If you can provide the language of origin, I may be able to find information.
* **It's a neologism or invented word:**  In this case, only the creator of the word would be able to provide its meaning and usage.

Please provide more context or correct the spelling if possible so I can assist you better.
