词源:

The word "nursery" comes from the Middle English word "nori," meaning "foster-child,"  which itself is derived from the Old French word "norricier," meaning "nurse," or "one who nourishes."  The "-ery" suffix indicates a place or establishment.  Therefore, the word originally described a place where children were nurtured or raised.  The extension of meaning to include plant nurseries reflects the similar idea of nurturing and growing something.
