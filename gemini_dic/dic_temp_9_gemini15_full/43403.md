词源:  The word derives from "crank,"  meaning an eccentric or irritable person, which itself has roots in a Middle English word meaning "to bend or curve."  The connection lies in the idea of someone being bent or twisted in their temperament.  The mechanical sense of "crank" (a bent lever) also contributes to the meaning of "crankly" as unstable or unreliable.
