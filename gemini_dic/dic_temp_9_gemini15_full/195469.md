semiooccasionally:/ˌsemiˌoʊˈkeɪʒənəli/ | adv. | 偶尔地，间或地 |  The word "semiooccasionally" is a humorous and somewhat contrived neologism, combining "semi-" (meaning half or partly) with "occasionally." It suggests something that happens less than occasionally, or perhaps with only partial regularity.  There is no standard dictionary definition. Its meaning relies on context and intended humorous effect. | Example: He semiooccasionally remembered to water the plants, resulting in several wilted specimens. 他偶尔会记得浇花，导致几株植物枯萎了。| 近义词：rarely, infrequently, sporadically, seldom | 反义词：frequently, regularly, always, constantly | adv.
