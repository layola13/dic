词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost."  It indicates something that resembles or approximates something else but isn't exactly the same.

* **sympathetic**: From Greek *sym-*, meaning "together," and *pathos*, meaning "suffering" or "feeling."  Therefore, sympathetic literally means "suffering with" or "feeling with."
