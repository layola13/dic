词源:
The word "mattress" comes from the Old French word "materas," which ultimately derives from the Late Latin word "matta," meaning "a mat" or "rug."  The suffix "-ress" is a feminine noun suffix, but in this case, it's simply part of the established word formation and doesn't have a gendered meaning.  Over time, the meaning evolved to refer specifically to the padded sleeping surface.
