词源：From Latin *matriculāri, frequentative of matriculāre "to enroll," from matricula "register," diminutive of matrix "mother, womb," from mater "mother."  The original sense was of enrolling in a register, like a mother's register of her children.  The modern sense developed from the medieval practice of university enrollment.
