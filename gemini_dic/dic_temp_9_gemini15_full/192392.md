The word "scrit" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible:

* It's a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* It's a slang term, regional dialect word, or a neologism (newly coined word) not yet widely recognized.
* It's a word from another language.  If so, please specify the language.

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you'd like me to help.
