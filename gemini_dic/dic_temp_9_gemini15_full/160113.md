词源:
The word "pommel" ultimately derives from the Old French word "pomme," meaning "apple," referring to the rounded knob on the pommel of a sword or saddle.  The verb "pommeling" developed from the action of hitting with such a pommel, and then broadened to encompass any forceful, repeated hitting with fists.
