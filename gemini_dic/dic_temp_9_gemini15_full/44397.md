PHRASE->
(There are no common idiomatic phrases using "cross-gartered".  The word itself is largely descriptive and historically contextual.)

词源:
The word is a compound of "cross" (meaning "across" or "in a crossed manner") and "gartered" (past participle of "garter," referring to the straps used to hold up stockings or socks).  The fashion of cross-gartering was prevalent in certain historical periods, and its association with effeminacy developed over time.
