词源:
The word "exquisite" comes from the Old French word "exquisit," which means "sought out," "chosen," or "select." This in turn derives from the Latin word "exquisitus," a past participle of "exquirere," meaning "to seek out," "to search for," or "to investigate."  The implication of careful selection and high quality is thus inherent in the word's etymology.
