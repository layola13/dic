PHRASE->
(Pitter-patter is rarely used in phrases beyond its inherent meaning.)  The word itself functions as a descriptive phrase.


词源:
The word is an onomatopoeia, meaning it imitates the sound it describes.  "Pitter" and "patter" are both imitative words describing light, repeated sounds.  The combination creates a more vivid and evocative image of the sound of light rain or footsteps.
