gradiometers:/ɡrædiˈɒmɪtərz/| n. |梯度计；磁力梯度仪|An instrument that measures the spatial gradient of a field, typically a magnetic field.  Gradiometers are used in various applications, including geophysical surveys, medical imaging, and navigation. |例句：Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) are often used as highly sensitive gradiometers in biomedical applications.  超导量子干涉器件（SQUID）常被用作生物医学应用中的高灵敏度梯度计。

例句：Geophysicists employ gradiometers to detect subtle variations in the Earth's magnetic field, helping to locate subsurface resources. 地球物理学家利用梯度计探测地球磁场的细微变化，有助于寻找地下资源。


近义词：magnetometer (for magnetic field measurements),  gradient sensor|反义词：None (it's an instrument, not a concept with direct opposites).
