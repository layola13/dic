preconductor: /ˌpriːkənˈdʌktə(r)/ | n. | 预导体，前导体 | A preconductor is a component used in electrical engineering, particularly in high-voltage power transmission systems. It is a conductor placed in front of or above the main conductor to influence the electric field distribution and reduce corona discharge.  This helps improve the efficiency and reliability of the power transmission line.  It might be used to shield the main conductor from external influences or to improve the performance of the system under specific conditions. | Example: The engineers installed a preconductor on the transmission line to mitigate corona losses.  = 工程师在输电线上安装了一个预导体以减轻电晕损耗。 | 近义词:  shield conductor,  pre-ionized conductor | 反义词:  main conductor
