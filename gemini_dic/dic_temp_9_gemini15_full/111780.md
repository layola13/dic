The word "loest" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps "lowest," "lost," "least," or another word entirely?  Please double-check your spelling.
* **A neologism or slang:**  A newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.  If this is the case, please provide more context about where you encountered this word.
* **A proper noun:**  Possibly a name or place name.  Again, more context is needed.


Without more information, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  If you can clarify the word or provide context, I can offer a more helpful response.
