词源:  The word "pouncer" is derived from the verb "pounce," which comes from the Old French word "panser," meaning "to strike with the paw" or "to stamp."  This ultimately derives from a Vulgar Latin word possibly connected to the Latin word "punctum," meaning "point."  The sense of sudden attack evolved from the original meaning of striking with a paw.
