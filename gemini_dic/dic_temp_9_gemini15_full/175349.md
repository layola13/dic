词源:
The word "rake" comes from the Old English word *raka, meaning "to scrape," and is related to the Old Norse word *reka, meaning "to reach, stretch."  Its use in the sense of "to gather with a rake" is a natural extension of its older meaning. The modern tool "rake" itself originates from this older verb meaning.
