词源:
The word "knackered" is believed to have originated in British English slang.  Its etymology is uncertain, but several theories exist. One suggests it's related to "knacker," a term for a person who slaughters old horses, implying being "worn out" like an old horse. Another theory links it to the word "knock," suggesting being "knocked out" or depleted of energy.  Regardless of its exact origin, its use as slang for exhaustion is well-established in British English and is increasingly used in other English-speaking regions.
