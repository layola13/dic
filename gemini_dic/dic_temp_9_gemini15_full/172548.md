pyroelectric:/ˌpaɪroʊɪˈlɛktrɪk/ | adj. | 热电的；热释电的 | Relating to or exhibiting pyroelectricity.  Pyroelectric materials generate an electric charge in response to a change in temperature.  | Example:  The pyroelectric sensor detected the infrared radiation emitted by the person.  热释电传感器检测到此人发出的红外辐射。 |近义词:thermoelectric (部分重叠含义)|反义词:  None directly opposing, but  materials lacking pyroelectric properties could be considered a contrasting concept.

词源:
From *pyro-* (from Greek πῦρ (pŷr) "fire") + *electric* (relating to electricity).  The term reflects the historical association of the effect with heat, although the underlying mechanism is related to changes in temperature and resulting dipole moment changes within the material.
