词源:
The word "desensitization" is derived from the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse"), the word "sensitization" (meaning "the process of making something sensitive"), and the suffix "-ation" (meaning "the act of" or "the process of").  Therefore, desensitization literally means "the act of removing or reversing sensitivity."
