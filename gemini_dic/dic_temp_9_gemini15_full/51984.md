USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun, so typical verb tenses don't apply directly to it.  The usages below relate to the use and explanation of diaereses.

Explanation of Diaereses:
A diaeresis is used to indicate the separate pronunciation of two adjacent vowels.  It prevents them from forming a diphthong.

Example 1: The word "cooperate" is sometimes written as "co-operate" with a hyphen to indicate the separate pronunciation of the vowels in "co". However, a diaeresis (¨) above the 'o' in 'co' could also achieve this.

Example 2: In the German word "naïve", the diaeresis shows that the "a" and "i" are pronounced as separate syllables, rather than being combined as a single sound.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "diaeretic".  The word is used in discussions of orthography, typography, and linguistics.
