词源:
Chiefship is a compound word formed from "chief" and the suffix "-ship."  "Chief" originates from Old French "chef," meaning "head," ultimately derived from the Latin "caput" (head). The suffix "-ship" indicates state, condition, or rank.  Therefore, "chiefship" literally means the "state or rank of being a chief."
