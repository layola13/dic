词源:
The word "retrievals" is derived from the verb "retrieve," which comes from the Old French word "retraire," meaning "to draw back, withdraw."  The prefix "re-" indicates "again" or "back," and the root "-traire" is related to the Latin word "trahere," meaning "to draw" or "to pull."  Therefore, "retrieve" originally meant to draw back or recover something. The suffix "-al" transforms the verb into a noun, signifying the act or process of retrieving.
