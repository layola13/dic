词源：

The word "instrumental" comes from the Middle English word "instrumental," which in turn derives from the Old French word "instrumental."  This ultimately traces back to the Latin word "instrumentum," meaning "instrument, tool."  The sense of "serving as a means" developed from the literal sense of using a tool or instrument to achieve a goal.
