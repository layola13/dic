metanephridial: /ˌmɛtənɪˈfriːdiəl/ | adj. | 后肾管的；排泄系统的 | Relating to or characteristic of metanephridia.  Metanephridia are excretory organs found in many invertebrates, such as annelids and mollusks. They are tube-like structures that collect waste products from the coelom (body cavity) and expel them from the body. | The earthworm's metanephridial system is highly efficient at removing waste.  地球蠕虫的后肾管系统非常有效地清除废物。| nephridial, excretory |  (no clear antonym, but could be considered the opposite of "non-excretory") |  形容词

PHRASE->

metanephridial tubules: 后肾管小管

metanephridial development: 后肾管发育
metanephridial structure: 后肾管结构


词源:

* **meta-**:  from Greek, meaning "after," "beyond," or "change."  In this context, it refers to a later stage of development or a more advanced type of nephridium (excretory organ).
* **nephr-**: from Greek *nephros*, meaning "kidney."
* **-idial**:  suffix indicating "relating to" or "characteristic of."

Therefore, "metanephridial" literally means "relating to a later or more advanced type of kidney structure."
