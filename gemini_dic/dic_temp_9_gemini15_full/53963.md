词源:

The word "discreditor" is derived from the verb "discredit," which itself comes from the Old French "descrediter," formed from the prefix "des-" (meaning "to remove" or "to deprive of") and "crediter" (meaning "to believe" or "to give credit to").  Therefore, "discredit" means to remove or deprive of credit or belief, and "discreditor" is a person or thing that performs this action.
