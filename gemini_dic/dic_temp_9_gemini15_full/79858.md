gmelinite:/ˈɡmɛlɪnaɪt/| n. | 钙沸石 | A hydrous calcium aluminum silicate mineral belonging to the zeolite group.  It typically occurs as colorless to white, sometimes reddish or yellowish, crystals or masses. Gmelinite is known for its relatively high porosity and ion-exchange capacity, making it of interest in certain industrial applications. | The gmelinite sample showed a distinct lamellar structure under the microscope.  这块钙沸石样本在显微镜下显示出明显的层状结构。| chabazite, heulandite |  | 名词
