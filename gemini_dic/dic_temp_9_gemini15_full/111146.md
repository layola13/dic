lithate:/ˈlɪθeɪt/| n.| 锂盐；尿酸锂盐| A salt of lithic acid (uric acid).  Lithates are formed when uric acid reacts with a base, such as sodium or potassium hydroxide.  They are often found in urine and can contribute to the formation of kidney stones. |Example: High levels of lithates in the urine can indicate a problem with uric acid metabolism. 高尿液中的锂盐含量可能表明尿酸代谢存在问题。|近义词：urate (if referring specifically to uric acid salts)|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The lab tests for lithates in the urine sample. = 实验室检测尿液样本中的锂盐。
High levels of lithates often indicate kidney problems. = 高浓度的锂盐通常表明肾脏问题。


一般过去时:
The doctor examined the lithates under a microscope. = 医生在显微镜下检查了锂盐。
The patient's urine showed a high concentration of lithates. = 病人的尿液显示出高浓度的锂盐。


现在完成时:

They had already suspected a lithate-related problem based on the patient's history. = 基于病人的病史，他们已经怀疑存在与锂盐相关的疾病。


将来时:
The study will examine the effectiveness of different treatments for lithate-related conditions. = 该研究将检查不同治疗与锂盐相关疾病的疗效。
Doctors will monitor the patient's lithate levels closely. = 医生将密切监测病人的锂盐水平。


虚拟语气:
If the lithate levels were lower, the prognosis would be better. = 如果锂盐水平较低，预后会更好。

The formation of lithates is influenced by several factors. = 锂盐的形成受多种因素影响。


疑问句:
Are lithates present in this patient's urine? = 这位病人的尿液中是否含有锂盐？
What are the typical symptoms associated with high lithate levels? = 高锂盐水平通常有哪些症状？


否定句:
The test results showed no significant presence of lithates. = 测试结果显示没有明显的锂盐存在。
The patient did not exhibit typical symptoms associated with high lithate levels. = 该患者没有表现出与高锂盐水平相关的典型症状。
