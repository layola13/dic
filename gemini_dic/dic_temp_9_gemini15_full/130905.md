词源:

The word is a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "asbestine" (referring to asbestos).  "Asbestine" itself derives from the Greek word "ἄβεστος" (bestos), meaning "unquenchable," referring to the material's fire-resistant properties.  The prefix "non-" is a common English prefix used to negate the meaning of a word.
