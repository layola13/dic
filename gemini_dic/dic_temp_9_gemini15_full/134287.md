noninheritability: /ˌnɒnɪnˌhɛrɪtəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 非遗传性 | The inability of a trait to be passed down from parent to offspring.  It refers to characteristics that are not determined by genes and are not heritable. This can be due to environmental factors, epigenetic modifications, or other non-genetic influences. | Example: The researchers found that the observed variation in plant height showed a high degree of noninheritability, suggesting a strong environmental influence.  研究人员发现，观察到的植物高度变化具有高度的非遗传性，表明环境影响强烈。| 近义词: nonheredity, nontransmissibility | 反义词: heritability, inheritability | 名词

过去完成时:
Before the discovery of DNA, the understanding of noninheritability was limited. = 在发现DNA之前，对非遗传性的理解是有限的。
They had already established the noninheritability of the acquired characteristic. = 他们已经确定了获得性状的非遗传性。


将来时:
Future research will further elucidate the mechanisms of noninheritability. = 未来的研究将进一步阐明非遗传性的机制。

被动语态:
The noninheritability of the trait was confirmed by multiple studies. = 该性状的非遗传性已得到多项研究的证实。
The degree of noninheritability is being investigated in ongoing research. = 非遗传性的程度正在进行的研究中被调查。


疑问句:
Is the noninheritability of this trait absolute? = 这种性状的非遗传性是绝对的吗？
What factors contribute to the noninheritability of this characteristic? = 哪些因素导致了这种特征的非遗传性？


否定句:
The study did not demonstrate complete noninheritability of the trait. = 该研究没有证明该性状的完全非遗传性。
This phenomenon is not solely due to noninheritability. = 这种现象并非仅仅由于非遗传性。
