词源:
The word "imparlance" comes from Anglo-French "imparlance," which itself is derived from Old French "enparler," meaning "to speak together,"  "to converse," or "to negotiate."  The prefix "im-" is a variant of "in-," indicating "in" or "into."  The root is related to the Old French "parole," meaning "word" or "speech," which ultimately derives from the Latin "parabola," a word with etymological links to "parable" and broader ideas of speaking and communicating.
