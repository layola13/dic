词源:

The word "gigantical" is derived from "gigantic," which itself originates from the Greek word "gigas" (γίγας), meaning "giant."  The suffix "-ical" is added to create an adjective form.  Therefore, "gigantical" literally means "relating to or characteristic of a giant" or "of giant size."


用法说明:

"Gigantical" is an adjective used to describe something exceptionally large in size, scale, or scope. While largely synonymous with "gigantic," "gigantical" is considered slightly more emphatic and less common.  It often evokes a sense of wonder or even fear due to the sheer magnitude of what is being described.  Its use should be reserved for situations where the size truly warrants such a strong adjective.  Overuse can make the writing sound exaggerated or hyperbolic.
