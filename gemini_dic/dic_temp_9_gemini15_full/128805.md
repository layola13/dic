词源:
The word "nightingale" comes from the Old English *nihtingale, a compound of niht ("night") and galan ("to sing").  The second element is related to the Old High German galan, meaning "to sing," and ultimately derives from the Proto-Germanic *galaną.  Thus, the name literally means "night singer."
