The word "ministrative" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a complete analysis as requested.  If you intended a different word (perhaps "administrative"), please provide the correct spelling.
