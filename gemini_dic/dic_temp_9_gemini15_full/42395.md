词源:

The word "countercaster" is a relatively modern coinage. It combines "counter," meaning "against" or "in opposition to," with "caster," a term often used to describe someone who performs or presents something, particularly in a forceful or dramatic way.  Thus, a countercaster is someone who forcefully opposes or contradicts.  There isn't a long established etymological history as with many older words.
