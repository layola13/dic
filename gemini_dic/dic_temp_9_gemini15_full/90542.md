huffman:/ˈhʌfmən/| n. |哈夫曼|Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. It is a specific type of prefix code.  The algorithm works by assigning variable-length codes to input symbols based on their frequency of occurrence.  More frequent symbols receive shorter codes, while less frequent symbols receive longer codes. This results in efficient data compression because fewer bits are needed to represent the more common symbols.|Example: Huffman coding is commonly used in file compression utilities to reduce file sizes.|近义词:data compression algorithm|反义词:data expansion algorithm|名词
