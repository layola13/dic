PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases directly using "physicochemical," as it's primarily used as an adjective to describe properties or processes.  Instead, let's look at phrases where it might appear:

physicochemical analysis: 物理化学分析
physicochemical properties: 物理化学性质
physicochemical processes: 物理化学过程
physicochemical characterization: 物理化学表征
physicochemical stability: 物理化学稳定性


词源:

The word "physicochemical" is a combination of "physical" and "chemical."  "Physical" comes from the Greek word "physikos," meaning "natural," related to "physis," meaning "nature."  "Chemical" comes from the word "alchemy," which evolved from Arabic and Greek origins related to the study of matter and its transformations.  The combining form "-o-" joins the two words.
