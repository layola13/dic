词源:
The word "scullion" comes from the Old French word "escuillon," which in turn derives from the Old French word "escuelle" meaning "bowl" or "dish."  The etymology reflects the scullion's primary duty of washing dishes and other kitchen utensils.  The term's evolution traces the progression of the word from a task to the person who performs it.
