词源：
The word "realienate" is a relatively rare and less common word. It's formed by combining the prefix "re-" (again, back) with "alienate."  "Alienate" itself comes from the Latin word "alienare," meaning "to make another's, to transfer, to estrange."  Therefore, "realienate" implies a renewed or repeated act of alienation, a further estrangement.
