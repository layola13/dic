词源:

The word "overinsisting" is a compound word formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") to the present participle "insisting" (from the verb "insist").  "Insist" itself comes from the Old French word "insister," ultimately derived from Latin "insistere," meaning "to stand upon," "to persist."
