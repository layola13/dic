词源：

The word "presumptuously" is derived from the adjective "presumptuous," which in turn comes from the verb "presume."  "Presume" ultimately originates from the Latin word "praesumere," which means "to take beforehand" or "to assume." The prefix "prae-" means "before," and "sumere" means "to take."  The addition of "-ous" creates the adjectival form, and "-ly" turns it into an adverb.


用法说明：

"Presumptuously" is an adverb that modifies a verb, describing how an action is performed. It highlights the overconfidence and lack of consideration involved in the action.  It often implies a transgression of boundaries or a disregard for proper etiquette. The action is done as if the subject has a right or authority they don't actually possess.
