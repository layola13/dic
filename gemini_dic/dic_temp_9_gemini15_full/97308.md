词源:
The word "informalities" is derived from the adjective "informal," which ultimately comes from the negative prefix "in-" (not) and the word "formal," meaning adhering to established conventions or rules.  The suffix "-ities" denotes a plural noun, indicating multiple instances or aspects of informality.  Therefore, "informalities" refers to multiple instances or aspects of a lack of formality.
