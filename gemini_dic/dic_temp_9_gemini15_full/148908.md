overwildly: /ˌoʊvərˈwaɪldli/ | adv. | 过分狂野地，过度放肆地 |  The word "overwildly" is not a standard English word. It's a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great extent) and "wildly" (meaning in a wild or uncontrolled manner).  It implies an excessive degree of wildness or unrestrained behavior.  Because it's not a standard word, there's no established usage in dictionaries or style guides. However, its meaning can be easily understood from its components. | 例句：He behaved overwildly at the party, causing a scene. 他在派对上行为过分放肆，引起了一场骚动。
