nonphagocytic: /ˌnɒnˌfæɡəˈsaɪtɪk/ | adj. |非吞噬性的| Not involving or relating to phagocytosis (the process by which certain living cells called phagocytes ingest or engulf other cells or particles).  It describes cells or processes that do not engage in phagocytosis. | Example:  "Nonphagocytic cells, such as lymphocytes, play a crucial role in adaptive immunity." = “非吞噬细胞，例如淋巴细胞，在适应性免疫中起着至关重要的作用。” |近义词: noningestive,  aphagocytic |反义词: phagocytic


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The nonphagocytic cells are crucial for immune regulation. = 非吞噬细胞对于免疫调节至关重要。
This process is nonphagocytic in nature. = 这个过程本质上是非吞噬性的。

一般过去时:
The researchers identified a novel nonphagocytic mechanism. = 研究人员发现了一种新的非吞噬机制。
The experiment demonstrated the nonphagocytic activity of the cells. = 实验证明了这些细胞的非吞噬活性。

现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered several types of nonphagocytic immune cells. = 科学家们已经发现了数种类型的非吞噬免疫细胞。
Studies have shown that this pathway is nonphagocytic. = 研究表明这条途径是非吞噬性的。

过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the mechanism was thought to be phagocytic, but it had actually been nonphagocytic. = 在这项发现之前，人们认为这种机制是吞噬性的，但实际上它是非吞噬性的。
It had become clear that the response was nonphagocytic in nature. = 已经清楚地表明，这种反应本质上是非吞噬性的。

将来时:
Future research will explore the role of nonphagocytic cells in disease. = 未来的研究将探索非吞噬细胞在疾病中的作用。
We will investigate whether this new process is phagocytic or nonphagocytic. = 我们将调查这个新过程是吞噬性的还是非吞噬性的。

虚拟语气:
If the cells were nonphagocytic, the immune response would be different. = 如果细胞是非吞噬性的，免疫反应就会不同。
It would be helpful if we understood the nonphagocytic mechanisms better. = 如果我们更好地理解非吞噬机制，那将会有所帮助。

被动语态:
The nonphagocytic nature of this response was confirmed by the experiments. = 实验证实了这种反应的非吞噬性。
The role of nonphagocytic cells in inflammation is being investigated. = 非吞噬细胞在炎症中的作用正在被研究。

疑问句:
Are these cells phagocytic or nonphagocytic? = 这些细胞是吞噬性的还是非吞噬性的？
What are the functions of nonphagocytic immune cells? = 非吞噬免疫细胞的功能是什么？

否定句:
This process is not phagocytic; it is nonphagocytic. = 这个过程不是吞噬性的；它是非吞噬性的。
The cells did not exhibit phagocytic activity, indicating a nonphagocytic response. = 这些细胞没有表现出吞噬活性，表明这是一个非吞噬性反应。


PHRASE->
nonphagocytic cells = 非吞噬细胞
nonphagocytic immune response = 非吞噬性免疫反应
nonphagocytic mechanism = 非吞噬机制
nonphagocytic pathway = 非吞噬途径
nonphagocytic activity = 非吞噬活性
