homogangliate: /ˌhoʊmoʊˈɡæŋɡliˌeɪt/ | adj. | 均质神经节的；具有同质神经节的 |  Having a homogeneous ganglion or ganglia.  The term refers to a structure or organism characterized by a uniform or similar arrangement of ganglia.  There is limited usage of this word outside of specialized biological contexts.  | Example: The study focused on the homogangliate nervous system of the invertebrate.  这项研究集中在无脊椎动物的均质神经节神经系统上。 |近义词:  (no precise synonyms, context-dependent)  |反义词: heterogangliate (having diverse ganglia) | 词性: 形容词


USAGE->
This word is highly specialized and doesn't lend itself to common grammatical usage examples like the template provides for common words.  The word would appear in scientific papers, not everyday conversation.  Therefore, the following examples are illustrative only, showing potential usage in a sentence.

一般现在时:
The specimen exhibits a homogangliate nervous system. = 这个样本表现出均质神经节的神经系统。
The researcher describes the organism as homogangliate. = 研究人员将该生物描述为具有均质神经节的。

一般过去时:
The scientist observed a homogangliate structure in the specimen. = 科学家在样本中观察到均质神经节的结构。
The previous study indicated a homogangliate arrangement. = 先前的研究表明了一种均质神经节的排列。

现在完成时:
Studies have confirmed the homogangliate nature of this species. = 研究已经证实了该物种的均质神经节特性。
Scientists have discovered several examples of homogangliate organisms. = 科学家们已经发现了几个具有均质神经节的生物的例子。

过去完成时:
Researchers had already hypothesized a homogangliate system before the experiment. = 在实验之前，研究人员已经假设了一个均质神经节的系统。
It had been previously believed that the organism was not homogangliate. = 以前人们认为该生物不是均质神经节的。

将来时:
Future research will investigate the development of homogangliate systems. = 未来的研究将调查均质神经节系统的发育。
We will analyze the data to confirm the homogangliate characteristics. = 我们将分析数据以确认均质神经节的特征。


虚拟语气:
If the organism were homogangliate, we would expect this result. = 如果该生物是均质神经节的，我们会期望得到这个结果。
It would be significant if we discovered a non-homogangliate exception. = 如果我们发现一个非均质神经节的例外情况，那将意义重大。

被动语态:
The homogangliate structure was clearly identified in the microscopy images. = 在显微镜图像中清楚地识别出均质神经节的结构。
The species's homogangliate nature has been widely documented. = 该物种的均质神经节特性已被广泛记载。

疑问句:
Is the nervous system of this invertebrate homogangliate? = 这种无脊椎动物的神经系统是均质神经节的吗？
Are there any known exceptions to the homogangliate pattern in this phylum? = 在这个门中，均质神经节模式有任何已知的例外吗？

否定句:
The species is not homogangliate; its ganglia are quite diverse. = 该物种不是均质神经节的；其神经节相当多样化。
The results did not support the hypothesis of a homogangliate nervous system. = 结果不支持均质神经节神经系统的假设。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "homogangliate".  The word is too specialized.
