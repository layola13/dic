词源:

The word "equivocalities" is derived from the adjective "equivocal," which comes from the Latin word "aequivocus."  "Aequi" means "equal," and "vox" means "voice."  Thus, the original meaning implied a statement with equal voices or interpretations—multiple potential meanings.  The suffix "-ities" transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the plural state or instances of equivocality.


用法说明:

Equivocalities are used to describe situations characterized by ambiguity, vagueness, or multiple possible interpretations.  They often arise in situations where:

*   A speaker or writer is deliberately avoiding a clear statement.
*   A statement is unintentionally unclear due to poor wording or phrasing.
*   A situation contains conflicting evidence or interpretations.


例句进一步说明:
