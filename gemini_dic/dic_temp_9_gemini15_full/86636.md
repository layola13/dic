词源:

The phrase "hell-on-wheels" likely originated in the late 19th century, possibly associated with the image of a runaway wagon or train, or a fast-moving, destructive force. The individual words "hell" and "wheels" contribute to the overall sense of chaos and danger.  The term’s evocative power lies in its vivid imagery and straightforward expression of extreme negative conditions.
