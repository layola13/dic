词源:

The word "governor" comes from the Old French word "gouverner," meaning "to govern" or "to rule."  This ultimately derives from the Latin word "gubernator," which has the same meaning, and is related to the word "helm" (as in steering a ship).  The suffix "-or" indicates the person who performs the action.
