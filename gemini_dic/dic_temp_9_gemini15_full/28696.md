词源:
The name "Carlisle" is derived from the Old English name *Caer Luel, meaning "fort of Luel."  Luel is believed to be a Romano-British name for a person or place.  The "Caer" prefix is common in British place names and means "fort" or "city".  Over time, the name evolved through various forms before settling on "Carlisle".
