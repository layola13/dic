词源:
The word "luckless" is a combination of the prefix "luck-" (meaning luck) and the suffix "-less" (meaning without or lacking).  Therefore, "luckless" literally means "without luck."  The word's origins trace back to the Old English word "lūc," meaning "luck," or "lot." The "-less" suffix is also of Old English origin.
