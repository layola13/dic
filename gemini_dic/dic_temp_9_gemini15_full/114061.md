magnetizable: /ˈmæɡnɪtaɪzəbl/ | adj. | 可磁化的 | Capable of being magnetized; susceptible to magnetic influence.  This adjective describes materials that can acquire magnetic properties when exposed to a magnetic field.  |


例句：

Iron is a magnetizable metal. = 铁是一种可磁化的金属。

This alloy is highly magnetizable. = 这种合金具有很强的可磁化性。


近义词：magnetic, susceptible to magnetism


反义词：non-magnetizable


词源:

The word "magnetizable" is derived from the word "magnet," ultimately tracing back to the Greek word "magnētis" (μαγνήτης), referring to a mineral (lodestone) found in Magnesia, a region in ancient Greece, known for its magnetic properties.  The suffix "-izable" indicates the capability of being subjected to the action or process described by the root word.
