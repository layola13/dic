词源:
The word "nuzzle" comes from the Middle English word "nuzelen," meaning "to push with the nose."  This, in turn, has roots in the Old French word "nuseler," which also means "to push with the nose."  The ultimate origin is likely onomatopoeic, imitating the sound of a nose being rubbed against something.
