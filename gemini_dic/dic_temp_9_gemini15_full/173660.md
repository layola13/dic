quasi-knowledgeably:/ˈkwɑːzaɪ ˈnɒlɪdʒəbli/ | adj. | 似懂非懂地；装作内行地 |  The term describes a manner of speaking or acting that suggests a superficial understanding or knowledge, often implying pretense or affectation. It combines the prefix "quasi" (meaning seemingly or apparently) with "knowledgeably" (meaning in a knowledgeable manner).  The speaker or actor may possess some knowledge but lacks a deep or complete understanding of the subject.  | Example: He spoke quasi-knowledgeably about quantum physics, using jargon he didn't fully grasp. 他似懂非懂地谈论量子物理学，使用了自己并不完全理解的行话。 |近义词：pretentiously, affectedly, superficially, seemingly | 反义词：knowledgeably, expertly, authoritatively |
