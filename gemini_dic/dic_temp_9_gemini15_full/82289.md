The word "groundworks" is a compound word.  "Ground" comes from Old English "grund," meaning "earth, soil, bottom."  "Work" comes from Old English "weorc," meaning "work, deed, action." The "-s" suffix indicates plurality, referring to multiple foundational actions or structures.  Therefore, "groundworks" literally means "the works of the ground," referring to the foundational work done on or within the ground.
