词源:
The word "contextured" is derived from the word "texture," which comes from the Old French word "texture," meaning "weaving, fabric," ultimately derived from the Latin word "texere," meaning "to weave."  The addition of "con-" might be considered an intensifying prefix, highlighting the richness or complexity of the texture. However, it's more likely a simple descriptive addition to indicate the overall nature of the surface, rather than a formal prefix with a specific meaning in this instance.
