The word "churchin" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a regional dialect word, a newly coined term, or a proper noun (perhaps a name or place).  To provide the requested analysis, I would need more context on where you encountered this word.
