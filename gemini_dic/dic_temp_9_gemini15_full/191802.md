scissiparity:/sɪsɪˈpærəti/| n. |裂殖；分裂生殖|The process of asexual reproduction by division of the body into two or more parts.  This is a form of binary fission, but typically refers to organisms that are more complex than bacteria.  Examples include some algae and certain protozoa.|例句：Many algae reproduce by scissiparity, resulting in two identical daughter cells.|近义词：binary fission, division, splitting|反义词：sexual reproduction
