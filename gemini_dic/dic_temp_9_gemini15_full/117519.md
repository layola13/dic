词源:
The word "meerkat" comes from Afrikaans, a language spoken in South Africa.  It is a combination of "meer" (lake) and "kat" (cat).  Although the etymology suggests a connection to lakes, it's likely a misnomer, as meerkats are not primarily associated with lakes.  The name may have originated from their slender, cat-like appearance.
