词源:
The term "man-of-war" originated in the 16th century.  "Man" refers to a person, specifically a soldier or sailor, and "war" refers to armed conflict.  Therefore, "man-of-war" literally means "a man of war," or a person involved in warfare, but it evolved to specifically denote a ship used in warfare.  The term's usage gradually shifted from referring to the crew to referring to the ship itself.
