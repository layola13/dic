词源:  The word is a compound of "frog" and "march." The "frog" element likely refers to the stiff, awkward gait often associated with someone being forcibly moved, perhaps reminiscent of a frog's jump.  The "march" element refers to the act of walking in a purposeful, often hurried, manner.  The combination creates a vivid image of forceful and uncooperative movement.
