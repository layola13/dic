punctum:/ˈpʌŋktəm/| n.|刺痛；要点；关键点；（照片中的）偶然细节|A punctum is a detail in a photograph or other image that unexpectedly and powerfully affects the viewer.

In a broader sense, it refers to any detail that unexpectedly holds significant meaning or impact. |Example: The punctum of the photograph was the child's forgotten toy lying abandoned in the corner, a detail that subtly highlighted the sadness of the scene.
