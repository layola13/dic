词源:
The word "inexcusably" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the word "excusable" (meaning "able to be excused"), and the suffix "-ly" (forming an adverb).  "Excusable" itself comes from the verb "excuse," ultimately derived from the Latin word "excusare," meaning "to excuse, to plead."
