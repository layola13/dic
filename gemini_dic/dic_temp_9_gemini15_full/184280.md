The word "resoun" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specific technical field or dialect not widely known.  To provide an analysis, I need the correct spelling or more context about where you encountered this word.
