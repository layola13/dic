The word "oomiac" is not found in standard English dictionaries or recognized etymological resources.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a fictional language, or a proper noun with limited usage.  To provide an analysis, further context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (Book, website, conversation, etc.)
* **What is the surrounding text?** This would help determine the intended meaning and potential origin.


Without this information, I cannot provide a pronunciation, word class, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical explanations as requested.
