词源:

The word "hypomixolydian" is a combination of:

* **hypo-**:  A prefix meaning "under" or "below," indicating a lowering of a degree in the scale.  This is borrowed from Greek.
* **mixolydian**: Referring to the Mixolydian mode, a church mode (or Greek mode) with a characteristic major seventh interval above the tonic.  This is derived from "Mixolydian" which comes from ancient Greek, referring to a group of people in Asia Minor.

Therefore, hypomixolydian literally means "below Mixolydian" in terms of its scale construction.
