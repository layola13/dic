词源:
The word "deraignement" is derived from the Old French word "desraignement," which literally translates to "disarrangement" or "disordering."  It combines the prefix "des-" (meaning "un-" or "away") with "raignement," which is related to the verb "raigner," meaning "to arrange" or "to govern."  Therefore, the original meaning pointed to a disarrangement of the mental faculties, leading to the modern understanding of mental derangement.
