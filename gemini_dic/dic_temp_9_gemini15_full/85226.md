词源:

The word "harlequin" comes from the Italian word "Arlecchino,"  a diminutive of "Arlecco," which itself is of uncertain origin.  Some etymologists suggest a possible connection to the word "herlequin," referring to a type of dog. The character and its name evolved and spread through the Italian commedia dell'arte and eventually into other European theatrical traditions.
