WORD ORIGIN->

The word "giddiness" ultimately derives from the Old English word "gydig," meaning "dizzy, foolish, or mad."  This term is related to the Proto-Germanic word "*gaidiz,"  which has similar meanings.  The modern English word evolved through Middle English "giddi," retaining the sense of dizziness and adding connotations of lightheadedness and frivolity over time.
