词源:
The word "prerequesting" is a combination of "pre-" (meaning before) and "requesting" (the act of making a request).  It's a relatively modern word, formed by adding the prefix "pre-" to the verb "requesting".  The core meaning comes from the verb "to request," with the prefix adding the temporal dimension of "beforehand."
