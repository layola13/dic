词源:  The word "praline" originates from the French word "pralin," which itself is derived from the name of a 17th-century French Marshal, César de Choisy, who supposedly invented a type of confection using almonds and sugar.  The French word ultimately traces back to the name of the Marshal's home, Plessis-Praslin.  Over time, the confection spread and evolved, with variations arising in different countries, notably in the Southern United States where pecan pralines became a beloved treat.
