butyrate:/ˈbjuːtəreɪt/| n.|丁酸盐；丁酸酯|A butyrate is a salt or ester of butyric acid. Butyrates are short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by the gut microbiota through fermentation of dietary fiber. They have various biological effects, including anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties.  |Example:  Sodium butyrate is a commonly studied butyrate salt.|近义词：butyric acid salt (部分情况)|反义词：无
