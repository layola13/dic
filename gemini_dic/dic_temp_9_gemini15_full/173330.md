Etymology:

* **quasi-**: From Latin "quasi," meaning "as if," "as it were," "almost," or "seemingly."
* **delicately**: From "delicate," ultimately from Latin "delicatus," meaning "alluring," "refined," or "dainty."  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective "delicate" into an adverb.  The combination creates a nuanced adjective, blending the sense of "almost" or "seemingly" with the quality of "delicacy."
