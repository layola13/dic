词源:
The word "fisher" comes from the Old English word "fiscere," which itself derives from Proto-Germanic "*fiskari-," meaning "fisherman."  This ultimately traces back to the Proto-Indo-European root "*peyḱ-", meaning "fish."  The "-er" suffix is a common agent noun suffix in English, indicating a person who performs the action.
