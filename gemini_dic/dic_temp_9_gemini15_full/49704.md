词源:  The word "demobilization" comes from the verb "demobilize," which is formed from the prefix "de-" (meaning "to reverse" or "to remove") and the word "mobilize."  "Mobilize" itself comes from the French word "mobiliser," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "mobilis" meaning "movable" or "easily moved".  Therefore, demobilization literally means "to make movable things not movable," referring to the process of reversing the mobilization of troops or resources.
