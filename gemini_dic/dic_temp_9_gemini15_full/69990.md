词源:
The phrase "fetch and carry" combines two common verbs:

* **Fetch:**  From Old English *feccian*, meaning "to go and get".  It retains its core meaning of retrieval.

* **Carry:** From Old English *cerran*, meaning "to turn, twist, transport".  It highlights the transportation aspect.

The combination emphasizes the repetitive nature of the act.  The phrase's usage evolved to describe subservient tasks.
