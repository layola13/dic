compilers:/kəmˈpaɪlərz/| n. |编译器|A compiler is a special program that translates source code written in a programming language (like C++, Java, or Python) into machine code that a computer can understand and execute.  This process is called compilation. Compilers check for errors in the source code during the translation process and generate an executable file which can be run directly on the computer.|Example:  The C++ compiler successfully translated the code into an executable file.  C++编译器成功地将代码翻译成了可执行文件。|近义词：translator, interpreter (although interpreters work differently)|反义词：None|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The compiler translates the code into machine language. = 编译器将代码翻译成机器语言。
This compiler supports multiple programming languages. = 此编译器支持多种编程语言。


一般过去时:
The compiler detected an error in line 10. = 编译器检测到第10行有错误。
The old compiler was much slower than the new one. = 旧编译器比新编译器慢得多。


现在完成时:
The developers have improved the compiler's performance. = 开发人员已经提高了编译器的性能。
We have used this compiler for many years. = 我们已经使用了多年的这个编译器。


过去完成时:
The program had already compiled before the power went out. = 断电前程序已经编译完成了。
They had finished debugging the code before running it through the compiler. = 他们在用编译器运行代码之前已经完成了代码调试。


将来时:
The team will release a new compiler next month. = 该团队将于下个月发布一个新的编译器。
We will use a different compiler for this project. = 我们将为此项目使用不同的编译器。


虚拟语气:
If we had a better compiler, the process would be faster. = 如果我们有一个更好的编译器，这个过程就会更快。
I wish the compiler would give more helpful error messages. = 我希望编译器能给出更有用的错误信息。


被动语态:
The code was compiled successfully. = 代码成功编译。
The program is being compiled right now. = 程序正在编译中。


疑问句:
What compiler are you using? = 你正在使用什么编译器？
Does the compiler support this new language feature? = 编译器支持这个新的语言特性吗？


否定句:
The compiler did not find any errors in the code. = 编译器没有在代码中找到任何错误。
The program will not compile without these libraries. = 没有这些库，程序将无法编译。



PHRASE->
compiler optimization: 编译器优化
compiler error: 编译器错误
just-in-time compiler: 即时编译器
cross compiler: 交叉编译器
compiler directives: 编译器指令
