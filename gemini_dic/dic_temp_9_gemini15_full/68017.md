factorability's:/ˌfæktərəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. |可因式分解性，可分解性 | The property of being factorable; the ease or difficulty with which a number or expression can be factored.  It refers to the ability of a mathematical object (like a number or polynomial) to be expressed as a product of simpler objects (factors). | Example: The factorability of the polynomial x² - 4 is high because it easily factors into (x-2)(x+2).  可因式分解性指的是多项式x² - 4 很高，因为它很容易分解成 (x-2)(x+2)。|近义词：divisibility, decomposability |反义词：prime, irreducibility |名词
