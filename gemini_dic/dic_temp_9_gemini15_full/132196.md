nondatival: /ˌnɒnˈdeɪtɪvəl/ | adj. | 非与格的；非受词的 |  Relating to or denoting a grammatical construction in which the recipient of something is not expressed as the indirect object of the verb.  This contrasts with a "dative" construction where the recipient is the indirect object.  For example, in the sentence "She gave him the book," "him" is the indirect object (dative) indicating the recipient.  A nondatival construction might express the same idea differently, perhaps focusing on the action of giving rather than the recipient.  | Example:  The sentence "She donated the book to the library" is considered nondatival because the recipient ("the library") is expressed as the object of the preposition "to," not as the indirect object of "donated."  | 近义词: indirect, non-recipient | 反义词: dative
