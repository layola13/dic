词源:
The phrase "in charge" originates from the older phrase "to have charge of," meaning to have responsibility or control over something.  The preposition "in" gradually replaced "to have" resulting in the modern usage.  The word "charge" itself comes from the Old French word *charge*, meaning "load, burden," reflecting the weight of responsibility.
