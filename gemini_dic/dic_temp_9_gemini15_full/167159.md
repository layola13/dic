词源:

The word "pretentiously" derives from the adjective "pretentious," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "praetendere," meaning "to hold out, stretch forth, allege, pretend."  The suffix "-ously" transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner in which something is done.  Therefore, "pretentiously" describes an action performed in a pretentious manner – that is, in a way that suggests more importance, ability, or knowledge than is actually possessed.
