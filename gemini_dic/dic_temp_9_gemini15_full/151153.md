paravant: /pa.ʁa.vɑ̃/ | adv. | 以前，先前 | Before, previously, beforehand |  Avant de partir, j'ai préparé mes bagages. (Before leaving, I packed my bags.)  Il a travaillé dur auparavant. (He worked hard before.) | 近义词: auparavant, autrefois, précédemment | 反义词: après, plus tard


USAGE->
(Since "paravant" is an adverb,  tense conjugation doesn't apply to it directly.  Its use is modified by the tense of the verb it modifies.)

Example sentences showing "paravant" in different contexts:

Note that direct English translations of “avant” or “paravant” may vary depending on context.  While both words mean “before,” “avant” is more common and versatile. “Paravant” has a slightly more formal or literary feel.
