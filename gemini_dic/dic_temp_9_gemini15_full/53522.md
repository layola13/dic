词源:
disastrously is derived from the adjective disastrous, which in turn comes from the noun disaster.  Disaster originates from the Old French word desastre, ultimately from the Medieval Latin word  dis-astro, meaning "ill-starred," "unfavorable stars."  The prefix dis- indicates negation or misfortune, while astro refers to stars or celestial bodies.  The implication was that adverse celestial events caused misfortune.  The suffix "-ously" transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating manner or way.
