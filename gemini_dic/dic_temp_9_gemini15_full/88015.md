词源:

The term "high-tech" is a compound word.  "High" is an old English word meaning elevated or superior.  "Tech" is a shortened form of "technology," which comes from the Greek words  "techne" (τέχνη), meaning "art, craft, skill," and "logia" (λογία), meaning "study of."  Therefore, "high-tech" literally means "superior technology" or "advanced technology."
