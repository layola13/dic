词源:
The word "overcoat" is a compound word formed from "over" and "coat".  "Over" indicates that it's worn over other clothing, while "coat" refers to a piece of outerwear.  The word's origin traces back to the Middle English period, with "coat" deriving from Old French "cote" (itself ultimately from Latin "cōta"). The modern usage solidified in the 18th century.
