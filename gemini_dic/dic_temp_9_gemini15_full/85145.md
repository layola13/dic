词源:  The term "hard-pressed" originates from the combination of "hard" (meaning difficult or severe) and "pressed" (meaning subjected to pressure or constraint).  The "pressed" element likely stems from the older meaning of "press" relating to physical pressure or being squeezed, which metaphorically extends to financial or circumstantial pressure.  The phrase developed organically in the English language, its usage solidifying over time.  There is no single identifiable origin point, rather it's an example of natural language evolution.
