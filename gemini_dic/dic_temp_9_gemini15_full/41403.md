词源:
The term originated in the Southern United States.  "Corn" refers to maize, a staple crop in the region, and "dodger" likely implies someone who skillfully avoids hardship or who is adept at making do with limited resources, specifically by relying heavily on cornbread as a primary food source. The term's evolution into a derogatory label reflects the historical prejudices and stereotypes associated with rural Southern populations.
