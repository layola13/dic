The word "heterodoxness" is derived from the word "heterodox," which itself comes from the Greek words "heteros" (other, different) and "doxa" (opinion, belief).  Therefore, the word literally means "having different beliefs" or "holding opinions that differ from the accepted norm." The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun indicating the state or quality of being heterodox.
