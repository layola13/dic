WORD ORIGIN->

The word "ideology" comes from the French word "idéologie," coined in the late 18th century by Antoine Destutt de Tracy.  It combines "idée" (idea) and "-logie" (the study of), literally meaning "the study of ideas."  Initially, it referred to a science of ideas, but its meaning evolved to encompass systems of beliefs and ideas that underpin social and political movements.
