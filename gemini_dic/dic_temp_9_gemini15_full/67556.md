词源:
The word "extraordinaries" is the plural form of "extraordinary," which comes from the Old French word "extraordinaire,"  itself derived from Latin "extraordinarius," meaning "out of the ordinary," "unusual," or "exceptional."  The prefix "extra" means "beyond" or "outside," while "ordinarius" relates to "order" or "rule."
