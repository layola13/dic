词源:
The word "hallucination" comes from the Late Latin word *hallucinatio*, a combination of *hallucinari* ("to wander in mind," "to rave," "to be delirious") and the suffix *-ation* ("action or process").  The root *hallucinari* itself has uncertain origins, possibly connected to the Latin word *allucescere* ("to be deluded").  The word's evolution reflects the historical understanding of hallucinations as a state of mental wandering or delirium.
