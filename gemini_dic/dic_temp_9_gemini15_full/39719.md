词源:
The word "consignment" comes from the Old French word "consignment," meaning "act of entrusting," from the verb "consigner," meaning "to entrust, consign."  The verb "consigner" is derived from the Latin prefix "con-" (together) and "signare" (to sign, mark).  The original sense reflected the act of formally signing over goods to another's care.  Over time, the meaning shifted to emphasize the goods themselves.
