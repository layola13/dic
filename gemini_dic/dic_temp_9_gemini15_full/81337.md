词源:

The word "graphicness" derives from the adjective "graphic," which ultimately comes from the Greek word "graphein" (γράφειν), meaning "to write" or "to draw."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun signifying the quality or state of being graphic.  Therefore, "graphicness" refers to the quality of being vividly descriptive or visually striking, often in a way that is detailed and potentially disturbing.
