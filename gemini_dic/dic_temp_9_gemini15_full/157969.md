USAGE->
This word, "planine," is not a standard English word.  It's primarily used in South Slavic languages (like Serbian, Croatian, Bosnian, etc.) to mean "mountain range" or "mountainous region." Therefore, grammatical examples in English tenses are not applicable to this word itself.  You would use English words like "mountain range," "mountains," or "highlands" in English grammatical structures.

PHRASE->
Since "planine" is not an English word, phrases using it would be in a South Slavic language and not translatable directly as English phrases.
