词源:
The word "intend" comes from the Old French word "entendre," meaning "to understand" or "to hear."  Over time, its meaning shifted to focus on the mental process of planning and purpose, evolving from understanding to intending.  The Latin root is "intendere," meaning "to stretch out," "to direct," or "to aim." This reflects the idea of directing one's efforts toward a specific goal.
