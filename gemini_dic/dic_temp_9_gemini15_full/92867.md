The word "Idalian" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun referring to something specific (like a place name or a person's name), or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible without further context.
