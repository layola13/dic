词源:  The term "dressing-down" likely evolved from the older nautical term "dress down," which meant to reprimand or punish someone severely.  The "down" likely refers to the lowering of someone's status or pride through the reprimand.  The evolution to its modern meaning occurred over time, with the emphasis shifting to the verbal aspect of the punishment.
