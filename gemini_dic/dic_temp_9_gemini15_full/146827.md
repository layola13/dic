It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, formed by combining "overimpression" (itself not a common word) with the suffix "-abilities," suggesting a plurality of abilities related to overimpression.  The meaning would likely refer to an excessive or heightened sensitivity to impressions or experiences, potentially leading to overwhelming feelings or reactions.  There are no established dictionaries or corpora that list this word.  Therefore, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage is impossible.
