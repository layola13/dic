词源:
The word "shape-shift" is a compound word formed from "shape" and "shift."  "Shape" comes from Old English *sċeap, meaning "form, appearance, figure," while "shift" originates from Old English *sciftan, meaning "to change, exchange."  Therefore, "shape-shift" literally means to change one's shape or form.
