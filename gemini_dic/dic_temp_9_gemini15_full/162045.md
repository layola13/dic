pre-ammonite: /ˌpriːˈæmənaɪt/ | n. | 前菊石类生物 |  A pre-ammonite refers to an extinct cephalopod mollusk that existed before the appearance of true ammonites in the fossil record.  These organisms share some characteristics with ammonites but lack certain key features.  They represent an evolutionary stage leading to the more advanced ammonites. |  The discovery of pre-ammonites sheds light on the evolutionary history of ammonoids. |  近义词: proto-ammonite (less common) | 反义词: ammonite (later evolutionary stage)
