phototaxy:/ˌfoʊtoʊˈtæksi/| n.|趋光性|The movement of a motile organism toward or away from a source of light.  Phototaxis is a behavioral response, and the direction of movement is determined by the intensity and direction of the light source. Positive phototaxis refers to movement towards the light, while negative phototaxis refers to movement away from the light.|Example: Many insects exhibit positive phototaxis, flying towards lamps at night.  许多昆虫表现出趋光性，晚上飞向灯泡。 Many species of algae display negative phototaxis to avoid intense sunlight. 许多藻类物种表现出避光性以避免强烈的阳光。|近义词: phototropism (植物的趋光性)|反义词: aphototaxis (无趋光性)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The algae exhibits positive phototaxis in low light conditions. = 藻类在低光照条件下表现出趋光性。
The moths show negative phototaxis to ultraviolet light. = 飞蛾对紫外线表现出避光性。


一般过去时:
The paramecium moved towards the light source; it showed positive phototaxis. = 草履虫向光源移动；它表现出趋光性。
The plant's leaves turned away from the bright sun, demonstrating negative phototaxis.  = 植物的叶子背向强烈的阳光，展现出避光性。（虽然这更符合植物的向性，但用作例子说明过去时）


现在完成时:
Many species have evolved sophisticated mechanisms for phototaxis. = 许多物种已经进化出复杂的趋光性机制。
The researchers have observed that the bacteria have shown negative phototaxis in the experiment. = 研究人员观察到细菌在实验中表现出避光性。


过去完成时:
Before the light was turned on, the Euglena had already demonstrated negative phototaxis. = 在灯打开之前，眼虫已经表现出避光性。
The scientists had hypothesized that the organisms would exhibit positive phototaxis, but their results proved otherwise. = 科学家们曾假设这些生物会表现出趋光性，但他们的结果证明并非如此。


将来时:
The scientists will study how the organisms will respond to different wavelengths of light, investigating their phototaxis. = 科学家们将研究这些生物如何对不同波长的光作出反应，从而研究它们的趋光性。
We predict that the insects will show positive phototaxis towards the artificial light source. = 我们预测昆虫将对人工光源表现出趋光性。


虚拟语气:
If the light intensity were higher, the organisms might exhibit negative phototaxis. = 如果光照强度更高，这些生物可能会表现出避光性。
It is possible that if the light source were different, the results of the phototaxis experiment would change. =  如果光源不同，趋光性实验的结果可能会改变。


被动语态:
Positive phototaxis was observed in the experimental group. = 在实验组中观察到趋光性。
Negative phototaxis has been shown to be influenced by several environmental factors. = 避光性已被证明受到多种环境因素的影响。


疑问句:
Does the organism exhibit positive or negative phototaxis? = 该生物表现出趋光性还是避光性？
What factors influence the phototaxis of this species? = 哪些因素影响该物种的趋光性？


否定句:
The bacteria did not exhibit phototaxis in the control group. = 在对照组中，细菌没有表现出趋光性。
The amoeba did not show any significant response to the light source, indicating a lack of phototaxis. = 变形虫对光源没有表现出任何明显的反应，表明缺乏趋光性。


PHRASE->
positive phototaxis
negative phototaxis
phototaxis response
