hydraulicity: /ˌhaɪdrɔːˈlɪsɪti/ | n. | 水力性，水力传动性 | The capacity of a substance or system to transmit or utilize hydraulic power.  It often refers to the ease with which fluids can flow through a porous medium (like rock or soil). | Example: The high hydraulicity of the sandstone allowed for efficient groundwater flow.  高渗透性的砂岩允许有效的地下水流动。 The hydraulicity of the braking system is crucial for its effectiveness. 制动系统的水力性对其有效性至关重要。 | 近义词：hydraulic conductivity, permeability | 反义词：impermeability
