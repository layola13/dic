词源:
The word "endocrinologist" is derived from "endocrinology" + "-ist".  "Endocrinology" itself comes from the Greek words "endon" (within) + "krinein" (to secrete) + "-ology" (the study of).  Therefore, endocrinology is literally the study of internal secretions, referring to hormones. The suffix "-ist" indicates a person who specializes in a particular field.
