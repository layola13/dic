PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "disangelical."  The word itself is relatively uncommon and used primarily as a standalone adjective.  Phrases would need to be constructed around it.  For example:

a disangelical act  一个邪恶的行为
a disangelical spirit 一个邪恶的精神
disangelical intentions 邪恶的意图
a disangelical plot 一个邪恶的阴谋
utterly disangelical behavior 极其邪恶的行为


词源:

The word "disangelical" is formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not," "opposite of") to "angelical," which derives from "angel" + "-ical" (meaning "relating to," "having the nature of").  Therefore, "disangelical" literally means "not angelic," highlighting the contrast with angelic qualities.
