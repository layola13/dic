词源:
The word "dejected" comes from the past participle of the verb "deject," which itself originates from the Latin word "dejectus," meaning "thrown down," "cast down," or "disheartened."  The prefix "de-" indicates "down" or "away," and the root "ject" relates to "throw" or "cast." Thus, the word's etymology directly reflects its meaning of being cast down in spirits.
