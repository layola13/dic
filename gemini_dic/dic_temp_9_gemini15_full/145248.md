词源:
The word "overbleached" is a compound word.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "too much" or "excessively," and "bleached" is the past participle of the verb "bleach," meaning to whiten or lighten something using a chemical agent.  Therefore, "overbleached" signifies that something has been subjected to an excessive amount of bleaching.
