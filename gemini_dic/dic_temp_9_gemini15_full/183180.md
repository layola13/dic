reprecipitation:/ˌriːˌpriːsɪpɪˈteɪʃən/| n. |再沉淀；再降水|The process by which previously precipitated material is dissolved and then reprecipitated, often forming new mineral phases or structures.  Reprecipitation can occur in various geological and chemical settings, such as in caves, soils, and hydrothermal systems.|例句：The reprecipitation of calcium carbonate led to the formation of stalactites in the cave.  洞穴中碳酸钙的再沉淀导致了钟乳石的形成。The reprecipitation of minerals in the soil improved its structure. 土壤中矿物的再沉淀改善了其结构。|近义词：redeposition, recrystallization |反义词：dissolution
