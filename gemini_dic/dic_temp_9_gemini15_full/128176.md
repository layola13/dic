词源:
The word "network" originates from the Old English word "net," meaning a woven fabric with openings.  The suffix "-work" was added later, indicating a structure or system made up of interconnected parts.  The modern meaning evolved from the concept of interconnected systems, like fishing nets or railway networks, to encompass the broader sense of interconnected people, devices, or ideas.
