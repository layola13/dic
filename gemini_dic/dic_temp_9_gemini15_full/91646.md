hyperboloid:/ˈhaɪpərˌbɔɪlɔɪd/| n. |双曲面|A hyperboloid is a quadric surface; that is, a surface defined as the zero set of a polynomial of degree two in three variables.  It has two sheets, and is a ruled surface, meaning it can be generated by straight lines.  There are two types: one-sheeted and two-sheeted.  A one-sheeted hyperboloid is connected, while a two-sheeted hyperboloid has two separate parts.|The cooling towers at many power plants are examples of one-sheeted hyperboloids.|近义词:quadric surface|反义词: ellipsoid
