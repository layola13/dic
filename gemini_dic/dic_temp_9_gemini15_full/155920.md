词源:
The word "photocopy" is a blend of "photo" (from Greek *phos*, meaning "light") and "copy".  The "photo" part refers to the use of light in the photocopying process, while "copy" refers to the act of making a duplicate.  It emerged in the mid-20th century with the development of photocopying technology.
