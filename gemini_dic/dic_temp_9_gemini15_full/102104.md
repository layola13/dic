4.  methyl isosulphocyanate: 异硫氰酸甲酯
5.  synthesis of isosulphocyanates: 异硫氰酸酯的合成


WORD ORIGIN->

The word "isosulphocyanate" is derived from the following components:

* **iso-**:  A prefix indicating isomerism (different arrangement of atoms in a molecule). In this context, it isn't necessarily implying a specific isomer but rather places the compound within the broader family of sulphocyanates.

* **sulfo-**:  A prefix indicating the presence of a sulfur-containing group, specifically a sulfo group (-SO2-). In this case, it relates to the thiocyanate group's sulfur atom.

* **-cyanate**:  A suffix indicating the presence of a cyanate group (-OCN) or a related group with a carbon-nitrogen bond. In isosulphocyanate, it refers to the -NCS group, which is isothiocyanate, related to cyanate but with a sulfur replacing the oxygen.


Therefore, the term indicates a chemical compound featuring a sulfur-containing group related to the cyanate group, with the "iso-" prefix generally suggesting a structural isomer.
