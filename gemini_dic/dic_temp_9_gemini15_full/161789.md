The word "poyntel" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (perhaps a name or place), or a neologism (newly coined word) not yet widely recognized.  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.
