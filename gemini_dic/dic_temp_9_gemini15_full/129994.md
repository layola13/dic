词源:

The word "non-negligent" is a compound word.  It combines the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "negligent".  "Negligent" comes from the Latin word "negligens,"  which is the present participle of "negligo," meaning "I neglect," or "I disregard."  Therefore, "non-negligent" literally means "not neglecting" or "not disregarding."
