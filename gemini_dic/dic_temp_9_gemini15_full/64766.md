词源:

The word "escutcheon" comes from the Old French word "escucheon," which itself derives from the Old French "escu," meaning "shield."  The suffix "-cheon" is a diminutive suffix, suggesting something small or of less importance relative to the original shield. The evolution reflects the shift from the escutcheon being solely a shield to also encompassing decorative plates and even metaphorical representations of reputation.
