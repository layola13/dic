diatomic:/ˌdaɪəˈtɒmɪk/ /ˌdaɪəˈtɑːmɪk/ | adj. | 双原子的；由两个原子组成的 |  Describing a molecule composed of two atoms of the same or different chemical elements.  | Example: Oxygen is a diatomic molecule (O2). 氧气是双原子分子（O2）。 Hydrogen is another example of a diatomic gas. 氢气是双原子气体的另一个例子。 |近义词：binary (in the context of molecules) | 反义词：monatomic, polyatomic |  词性：形容词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
