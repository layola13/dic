词源:

The word "overcentralizing" is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to a degree that is too much) and "centralizing" (from "centralize," meaning to concentrate (control, authority, etc.) in a center or central location).  "Centralize" itself originates from the Latin "centralis" (central).
