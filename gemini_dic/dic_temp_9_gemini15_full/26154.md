词源:
The word "busybody" is a compound word.  "Busy" has its roots in the Old English "bisig," meaning "occupied, active."  "Body" comes from the Old English "bodi," meaning "body, person."  The combination implies someone who is excessively busy with the affairs of others, hence a meddler.  The term evolved over time, its negative connotation becoming more pronounced.


用法说明:
Busybody is primarily used as a noun.  It is generally used negatively to describe someone who is overly interested in the private lives or affairs of others and who often interferes inappropriately.  It implies a lack of discretion and respect for personal boundaries.  The term is often used informally and can be considered somewhat harsh.
