词源：
The word "recounsel" is formed from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") and the verb "counsel" (meaning "to advise" or "to give guidance").  Therefore, it literally means "to counsel again."  The root of "counsel" traces back to Old French "conseille" and ultimately to Latin "consiliu," meaning "deliberation, advice."
