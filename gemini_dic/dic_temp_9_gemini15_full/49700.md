词源:
The word "demobilised" is derived from the word "mobilise" (to prepare and organize (troops, etc.) for active service), with the addition of the prefix "de-" (meaning "to reverse or remove").  Therefore, "demobilised" means the opposite of "mobilised," signifying the process of ending military service or disbanding a military force.
