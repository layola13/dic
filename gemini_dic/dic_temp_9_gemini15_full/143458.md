词源:
The word "outfroth" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "beyond," "excessively," or "to a great extent") and the verb "froth," which refers to the formation of foam or bubbles.  Thus, "outfroth" literally means to froth excessively or to overflow with froth.  It's a relatively rare word, primarily used in descriptive contexts involving liquids or other substances producing foam.
