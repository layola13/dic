词源:
"Doggone" is a euphemistic alteration of "God damn," which itself is a shortened form of "God damn it." The original phrase is considered profane, so "doggone" was used as a milder substitute, avoiding the religious connotations.  The substitution of "dog" for "God" is a common form of euphemism in English.
