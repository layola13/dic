coelospermous: /ˌsiːləʊˈspɜːməs/ | adj. | 空腔种子植物的；具空腔种子的 | Relating to or characteristic of plants with hollow seeds.  The term is primarily used in botanical classifications, referring to a group of plants whose seeds possess a cavity or hollow space. This feature is often associated with certain seed structures and dispersal mechanisms.  The term is less commonly used in modern botanical classifications, as it's been largely superseded by more precise and detailed systems.
