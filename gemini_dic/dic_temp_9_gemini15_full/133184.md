WORD ORIGIN->
The word "nonevasiveness" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "invasiveness."  "Invasiveness" comes from the verb "invade," ultimately from the Latin "invadere," meaning "to enter upon, attack."  Therefore, "nonevasiveness" literally means "not invading" or "lack of invasion."
