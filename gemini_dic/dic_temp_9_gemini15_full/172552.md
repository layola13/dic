pyrogallol:/ˌpaɪroʊˈɡælɒl/| n. |焦性没食子酸|Pyrogallol is a benzenetriol, a phenolic compound with three hydroxyl groups attached to a benzene ring. It is a white crystalline solid that turns brown upon exposure to air.  It is used as a developing agent in photography and as an absorbent for oxygen. |The pyrogallol solution rapidly absorbed the oxygen in the air. 焦性没食子酸溶液迅速吸收了空气中的氧气。|gallic acid, 1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene|  (no direct antonym)|名词
