词源:

The word "pullback" is a compound word formed from "pull" and "back."  "Pull" originates from Old English *pullian, meaning "to pluck, pull."  "Back" also originates from Old English bæc, meaning "back."  Therefore, "pullback" literally means "to pull back," reflecting its meaning of withdrawal or retreat.
