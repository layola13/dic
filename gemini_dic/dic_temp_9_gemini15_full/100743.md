This word is extremely rare and not commonly used.  It is the plural form of "intransitiveness," which itself is not frequently encountered in everyday language.  Therefore, providing detailed usage examples across various grammatical tenses is impractical, as the word's usage is highly specialized and limited primarily to linguistic analysis.


The word is derived from:

* **in-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "without."
* **transit-**: From Latin "transire," meaning "to go across" or "to pass over."  This relates to the grammatical concept of transitivity, where a verb's action "passes over" to a direct object.
* **-ive**: A suffix forming adjectives, meaning "having the nature of" or "tending to."
* **-ness**: A suffix forming nouns of state or quality.
* **-es**:  Plural suffix.

Therefore, "intransitivenesses" refers to multiple instances or examples of the quality of being intransitive—meaning verbs that do not take a direct object.  The word implies a discussion or analysis of several different examples of this grammatical phenomenon.  It's a highly technical term used within the field of linguistics, particularly in discussions of verb classification and syntactic structure.  There are no common phrases associated with this word due to its rarity.
