Word Origin:

The word is formed from:

* **non-**: a prefix meaning "not"
* **tutorial**:  relating to a tutor or teaching;  derived from "tutor" (from Old French "tuteur," ultimately from Latin "tueri" - to protect, guard, watch over).


The combination creates a word signifying the absence of tutorial instruction or guidance.
