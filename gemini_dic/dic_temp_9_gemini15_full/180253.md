词源:
The word "refrain" comes from Old French *refrener*  meaning "to bridle, restrain," which is from the prefix *re-* (again) + *frener* (to bridle).  The meaning evolved from the literal act of restraining an animal to the metaphorical act of restraining oneself.  Its use as a repeated line in a song developed later.
