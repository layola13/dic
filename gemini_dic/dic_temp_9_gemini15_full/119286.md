micro-electrophoresis: /ˌmaɪkroʊɪˌlɛktroʊfəˈriːsɪs/ | n. | 微电泳 | The technique of separating charged particles in a liquid medium under the influence of an electric field, typically on a microscopic scale.  It's used in various scientific fields to analyze and separate molecules based on their size and charge. | Example: Micro-electrophoresis is used to analyze the size and charge of proteins. 微电泳用于分析蛋白质的大小和电荷。 | 近义词: capillary electrophoresis, zone electrophoresis | 反义词: (no direct antonym, but techniques like sedimentation could be considered contrasting) |  词性: 名词
