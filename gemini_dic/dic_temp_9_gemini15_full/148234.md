词源:
The word "oversimplified" is formed by the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively"),  the adjective "simplified" (meaning "made simpler"), which itself is derived from the verb "simplify," and the suffix "-ed" indicating the past participle or adjectival form.  "Simplify" comes from the Latin "simplex" (simple) + "ficare" (to make).
