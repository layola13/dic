Etymology:

The word "commodiousnesses" is the plural form of "commodiousness," which derives from the adjective "commodious."  "Commodious" itself comes from the Late Latin word "commodiosus," meaning "convenient, suitable, ample." This in turn is derived from the Latin "commodus," meaning "convenient, suitable, advantageous."  The suffix "-ness" is added to form the noun "commodiousness," indicating a state or quality.  The further addition of "-es" creates the plural.


Usage:

While "commodiousness" is used, its plural "commodiousnesses" is relatively uncommon.  It's generally used to refer to multiple instances or aspects of spaciousness and convenience.  It's more likely to be found in formal or written contexts.


Example Sentences:

The multiple commodiousnesses of the cruise ship were a welcome surprise.  邮轮的诸多便利设施令人惊喜。

We compared the commodiousnesses offered by different hotels before making a reservation.  我们在预订酒店之前比较了不同酒店提供的便利条件。


Note:  Because the word is uncommon, providing examples of its use in different grammatical tenses would be artificial and unhelpful. The grammatical function is the same as that of any plural noun.  It functions as the subject, object, or complement of a sentence.
