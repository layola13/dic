/ˌpriːsʌˈfɪʃənsiz/ | n. | 预先充足；预先准备 |  The word "presufficiencies" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, likely formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before) and "sufficiency" (meaning enough).  Therefore, a precise definition and usage examples are impossible to provide.  It likely refers to the state of having enough resources or preparations *before* a particular event or need.  The intended meaning would depend heavily on context. |  *Example (hypothetical):*  "The presufficiencies for the expedition were meticulously planned, ensuring ample supplies and equipment." | 近义词: pre-planning, advance preparations, prior provisions | 反义词: unpreparedness, deficiency, lack |  名词
