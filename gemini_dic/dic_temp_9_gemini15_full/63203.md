词源:
The word "entendre" is borrowed from French, where it means "to hear" or "to understand".  The double meaning is implied, not explicitly stated, hence the association with hidden meanings.  It's ultimately derived from the Latin verb *intendere*, meaning "to stretch," "to aim," or "to direct."  This suggests the idea of stretching the meaning of words to encompass a secondary, often implied, interpretation.
