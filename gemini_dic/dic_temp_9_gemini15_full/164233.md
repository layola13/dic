词源:
The word "predominators" is derived from the verb "predominate," which comes from the Latin words "prae-" (before, in front of) and "dominari" (to rule, to dominate).  Thus, "predominate" means to be dominant or prevalent.  The suffix "-ors" is added to form the noun "predominators," indicating the people or things that predominate.
