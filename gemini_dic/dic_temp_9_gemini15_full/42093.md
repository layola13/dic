cotransferred:/ˌkoʊtrænsˈfɜːrd/| adj.| 共同转移的，同时转移的 |Transferred or moved together.  This term is often used in the context of genetics and cell biology, describing the simultaneous transfer of multiple genes or genetic elements. | Example: Cotransferred genes were found to be clustered on the same chromosome. 共同转移的基因被发现聚集在同一条染色体上。|近义词: jointly transferred, simultaneously transferred |反义词: separately transferred


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The genes are cotransferred during the experiment. = 在实验过程中基因被共同转移。
This method cotransfers multiple plasmids efficiently. = 这种方法能有效地共同转移多个质粒。


一般过去时:

虚拟语气:
If we had a better method, we would cotransfer the genes more efficiently. = 如果我们有更好的方法，我们将更有效地共同转移基因。
It would be helpful if they could cotransfer all the necessary genes simultaneously. = 如果他们能够同时共同转移所有必要的基因，那将很有帮助。


被动语态:
The genes were cotransferred by electroporation. = 基因通过电穿孔法被共同转移。
The plasmids are being cotransferred into the cells. = 质粒正在被共同转移到细胞中。


疑问句:
Were the genes cotransferred successfully? = 基因是否成功地被共同转移了？
How were the genes cotransferred in this experiment? = 在这个实验中基因是如何共同转移的？


否定句:
The genes were not cotransferred in the control group. = 在对照组中，基因没有被共同转移。
They did not cotransfer the genes correctly. = 他们没有正确地共同转移基因。


PHRASE->
cotransferred genes = 共同转移的基因
