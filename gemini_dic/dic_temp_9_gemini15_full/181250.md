词源:
re- (again) + installment (a single payment in a series)  "reinstallment" combines the prefix "re-" indicating repetition or renewal, with "installment," referring to a portion of a larger payment or a process of installation.  Therefore, "reinstallment" literally means "the act of installing again" or "a repeated payment."
