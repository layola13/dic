euornithes:/ˌjuːɔːˈnaɪθiːz/| n. | 今鸟类 | Euornithes is a clade containing most living birds, excluding paleognaths (like ostriches and emus).  It's characterized by several skeletal features and represents a significant evolutionary radiation. |  The evolutionary relationships within Euornithes are still being researched, but it encompasses a vast majority of the avian diversity we see today. | 近义词: Neornithes (often used interchangeably, but with subtle cladistic differences) | 反义词: Paleognathae


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in scientific contexts, specifically within ornithology (the study of birds) and evolutionary biology.  Therefore, there aren't common usages in everyday conversation like "what" in the example.  Grammatical structures are applied as they would be with any other noun.


一般现在时:
Euornithes are a diverse group of birds. = 今鸟类是一个多样化的鸟类群体。
The phylogeny of Euornithes is complex. = 今鸟类的系统发育很复杂。


一般过去时:
Scientists classified many species within Euornithes. = 科学家将许多物种归类为今鸟类。
The characteristics of Euornithes were studied extensively. = 今鸟类的特征被广泛研究。


现在完成时:
Researchers have discovered many fossils of Euornithes. = 研究人员已经发现了许多今鸟类的化石。
The study of Euornithes has greatly advanced our understanding of bird evolution. = 对今鸟类的研究极大地提高了我们对鸟类进化的理解。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, little was known about the origins of Euornithes. = 在发现之前，人们对今鸟类的起源知之甚少。
Scientists had hypothesized about the relationships within Euornithes. = 科学家们曾对今鸟类内部的关系进行过假设。


将来时:
Further research will reveal more about Euornithes. = 进一步的研究将揭示更多关于今鸟类的信息。
Scientists will continue to study the evolutionary history of Euornithes. = 科学家们将继续研究今鸟类的进化史。


虚拟语气:
If Euornithes had evolved differently, birds today might be very different. = 如果今鸟类的进化方式不同，今天的鸟类可能大相径庭。
It is hypothesized that if certain conditions were different, Euornithes might not exist. = 假设如果某些条件不同，今鸟类可能不存在。


被动语态:
Euornithes are being studied by many scientists worldwide. = 今鸟类正在被世界各地的许多科学家研究。
Many new species of Euornithes have been identified. = 许多新的今鸟类物种已被鉴定。


疑问句:
What are the defining characteristics of Euornithes? = 今鸟类的定义特征是什么？
How did Euornithes evolve from their ancestors? = 今鸟类是如何从它们的祖先进化而来的？


否定句:
Euornithes are not a monophyletic group in some classifications. = 在某些分类中，今鸟类不是一个单系群。
Not all birds belong to the Euornithes clade. = 并非所有鸟类都属于今鸟类支系。
