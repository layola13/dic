词源:

The word "predrawer" is a relatively recent coinage, formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") with the word "drawer," which here refers to someone who draws or makes drawings.  The word therefore literally means "one who draws beforehand."  Its origins are not rooted in classical Latin or Greek, unlike many other English words.  It's a modern construction reflecting the modern need for a term describing this specific role in design and engineering.
