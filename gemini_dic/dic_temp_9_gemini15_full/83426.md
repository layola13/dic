The word "habis" is not an English word.  It's likely from another language, possibly Indonesian or Malay.  Therefore, a full English-language analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide the requested information, I need the language of origin.  If you can specify the language, I can offer a translation, pronunciation, etymology (word origin), usage examples, and potentially synonyms and antonyms within that language's context.
