The word "entastic" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it in major resources like Merriam-Webster, Oxford English Dictionary, or Cambridge Dictionary.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a newly coined word, or a word from a very specialized or niche vocabulary.

To help you, if you could provide context where you encountered this word (e.g., a sentence, a document, a website), I might be able to offer a guess at its intended meaning or suggest a possible correct spelling.
