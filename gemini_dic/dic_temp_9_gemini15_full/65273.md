词源:
From Late Middle English, from Old French *eucaristic, from Late Latin eucharistia, from Greek Eucharistia “thanksgiving,” from eucharistos “thankful,” from eu- “well” + charis “grace, favor.”  The word ultimately derives from the Greek phrase used by Jesus at the Last Supper expressing gratitude.
