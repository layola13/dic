词源:
The word "knottiness" derives from the word "knot," meaning a fastening made by tying a piece of string, rope, etc.  The suffix "-iness" adds the sense of a quality or state.  Therefore, "knottiness" refers to the quality of being full of knots, metaphorical or literal.  The evolution is straightforward from the concrete image of tangled knots to the abstract concept of complexity and difficulty.
