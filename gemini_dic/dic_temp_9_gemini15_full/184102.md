The word "resimmers" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a newly coined word, or a word from a specific jargon or dialect.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical explanation are impossible.  To provide a response, we need to clarify what word was intended.  If you can provide context or the intended word, I can provide the requested analysis.
