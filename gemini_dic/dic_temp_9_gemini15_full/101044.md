词源:
The word "inveigh" comes from the Old French word "enveier," meaning "to send forth," "to urge," or "to incite."  This in turn derives from the Latin word "inviare," meaning "to send in," which is a compound of the prefix "in-" (into) and the verb "viare" (to travel, to go).  The shift in meaning from "send" to "attack verbally" likely occurred through a metaphorical extension, suggesting the forceful sending of words as an attack.
