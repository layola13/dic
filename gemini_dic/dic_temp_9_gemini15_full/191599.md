词源:
The word is a combination of "schoolgirl" (a girl attending school) and the suffix "-ness," which creates nouns indicating a state, quality, or condition.  Therefore, it literally means "the quality or state of being like a schoolgirl."  The word's meaning evolved to encompass not just literal schoolgirls but also the associated traits of immaturity and naiveté, even in older individuals.
