polarizabilities:/ˌpoʊləraɪzəˈbɪlətiz/| n. |极化率；偏振率 |The ability of a molecule or atom to be polarized by an electric field.  This property is crucial in understanding various phenomena, including the refractive index of materials and the interaction of light with matter.  Polarizability is a measure of how easily the electron cloud of an atom or molecule can be distorted by an external electric field.  Higher polarizability indicates greater ease of distortion. |例句：The polarizabilities of these molecules were measured using Raman spectroscopy.  这些分子的极化率是用拉曼光谱测量的。

The study of molecular polarizabilities is essential for understanding intermolecular forces.  分子极化率的研究对于理解分子间力至关重要。|近义词：susceptibility (in the context of electric fields) |反义词：None directly opposite, but low polarizability would be the opposite concept. |名词

WORD ORIGIN->

The word "polarizability" is derived from "polarize" + "-ability".  "Polarize" comes from the French "polariser," ultimately from  "pole" (meaning a point of reference or extremity). "-ability" is a suffix indicating capacity or capability.  The concept reflects the ability of a substance to develop poles (positive and negative charges) under the influence of an electric field.
