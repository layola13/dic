/ˌoʊvərˈpeɪnfəlˌnɛsɪz/ | n. |过度疼痛；过分痛苦 | The word "overpainfulnesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a contrived formation, combining "over" (meaning excessive), "painful" (causing pain), and the plural "-nesses" (indicating a state or quality).  It suggests multiple instances of excessive pain or suffering.  There are no standard dictionaries or corpora that list this word.  To convey the intended meaning, using more common and precise language is recommended. For instance, one might use phrases like "excessive pains," "intense suffering," "multiple instances of acute pain," or "unbearable agony." |  There are no standard example sentences using this non-existent word. |近义词: excessive pains, intense suffering, excruciating pain, unbearable agony | 反义词: comfort, ease, relief |  n.
