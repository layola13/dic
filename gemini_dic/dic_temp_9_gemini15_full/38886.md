词源:  Comes from the verb "confer," meaning "to grant, bestow, or discuss."  This verb itself originates from the Latin "conferre," meaning "to bring together," a combination of "con-" (together) and "ferre" (to bear or carry).  The "-al" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, indicating the act or process.
