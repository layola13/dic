The word "persolve" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).

If you meant a different word, please provide the correct spelling.  If you intended to create a new word, please provide its intended meaning and context so I can offer a possible analysis based on that.
