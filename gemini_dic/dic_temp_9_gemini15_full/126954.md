2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, a slang term, or a word specific to a particular dialect or community.  More context is needed.

3. **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language that hasn't been fully integrated into English.  If you can provide the source language, it might be possible to provide a translation and explanation.
