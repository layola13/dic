/ˈɪntərstriːt/| n.|街道间的；街区间的；|The word "interstreet" is not a standard English word.  It's a possible neologism, a newly coined word formed by combining "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and "street."  It would logically refer to something located between streets, such as an alleyway or a space between buildings on different streets.|例句：There's a hidden park in the interstreet space between Elm Street and Oak Street. 街道间的空地上隐藏着一个公园。(This is a hypothetical example using the word.)|近义词：interblock, between streets|反义词：on street, within street|名词
