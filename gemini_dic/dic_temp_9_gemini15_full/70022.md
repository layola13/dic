WORD ORIGIN->

The word "fetishised" is derived from the word "fetish," which comes from the Portuguese word "feitiço," meaning "charm" or "magic."  The term was adopted by anthropologists in the 19th century to describe objects of religious veneration in certain cultures, often associated with animistic beliefs.  Over time, the meaning evolved to include a more psychological connotation, referring to an excessive or irrational attachment to an object or concept.  The verb form "fetishised" reflects this modern, psychological understanding.
