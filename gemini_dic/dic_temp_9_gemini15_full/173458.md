quasi-expensively: /ˈkwɑːzaɪ ɪkˈspɛnsɪvli/ | adv. | 准昂贵地，近似昂贵地 |  The word "quasi-expensively" is not a standard English word. It's a newly coined word combining "quasi" (meaning seemingly, apparently, or to a certain extent) and "expensively" (meaning at a high cost). It suggests something that appears expensive or has some characteristics of being expensive but doesn't quite reach the level of true expensiveness.  It implies a relative or approximate expensiveness. |例句：The restaurant offered a quasi-expensively decorated dining room, but the food itself was surprisingly affordable. 这家餐厅提供了一个装修看似昂贵的用餐室，但食物本身却出奇地实惠。  The imitation jewelry looked quasi-expensively made, fooling many into thinking it was genuine.  那些仿造的珠宝看起来像是昂贵制作的，骗过了许多人以为是真品。| 近义词：relatively expensively, somewhat expensively, pricy-seeming | 反义词：cheaply, inexpensively
