normalizations:/ˌnɔːrməlaɪˈzeɪʃənz/ | n. | 规范化；标准化；正规化 | The process of transforming data to fit a specific format or structure, often to improve data quality, consistency, and usability.  It can involve various techniques, such as scaling, centering, or transforming data to a standard distribution.  Normalization is crucial in many fields, including databases, statistics, and machine learning. | Example: Data normalization is essential for accurate analysis and reliable model building. 数据规范化对于准确的分析和可靠的模型构建至关重要。|近义词：standardization, regularization | 反义词：randomization, irregularity |名词
