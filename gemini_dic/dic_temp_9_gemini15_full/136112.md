nonreducibilities:/ˌnɒnˌrɪdjuːsɪˈbɪlətiz/| n. |不可简约性；不可归约性|The inherent inability of a system or concept to be simplified or reduced to a more basic form without losing essential information or properties.  This term is often used in mathematics, computer science, and philosophy to describe situations where a complex system cannot be broken down into simpler, independent components without losing crucial aspects of its behavior or meaning. For example, in computational complexity theory, nonreducibilities refer to the impossibility of efficiently reducing one computational problem to another.  |The nonreducibilities in quantum mechanics make it fundamentally different from classical mechanics. 量子力学中的不可简约性使其与经典力学有着根本的不同。The study of complex systems often reveals surprising nonreducibilities. 对复杂系统的研究常常揭示出令人惊讶的不可简约性。|近义词：irreducibilities, incompressibilities |反义词：reducibilities
