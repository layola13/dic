词源:The word is an onomatopoeia, imitating the sound of someone expressing disdain.  The origin is uncertain, but it's likely a reduplication of a word expressing disapproval, perhaps related to "pooh," an interjection expressing contempt or disgust.  Its first recorded use was in the late 19th century.
