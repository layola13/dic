词源:
The word "equestrienne" is derived from the French word "équestre," meaning "equestrian," which in turn comes from the Latin word "equester," meaning "of or belonging to a horseman or knight."  The suffix "-ienne" is a French feminine suffix, indicating a female practitioner.  Therefore, "equestrienne" literally means "female equestrian."
