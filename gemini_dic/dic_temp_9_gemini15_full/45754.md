词源:
The word "cushiness" is derived from the word "cushion,"  meaning a soft pad used for comfort.  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun describing the quality or state of being cushioned.  Ultimately, "cushion" has roots in the Old French "coissin," possibly derived from the Latin "culcita" (a mattress).
