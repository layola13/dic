词源:
The word "desume" comes from the Latin word "desumere," which means "to take away," "to remove," or "to infer."  The original sense implied taking something away from a larger whole to understand it—a process akin to deduction or inference.  It's a less common word, retaining a more formal and scholarly tone.
