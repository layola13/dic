/ˌɪntərˈfrɪkʃən/| n. |相互摩擦；冲突；磨擦|The word "interfriction" is a relatively uncommon word that combines the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") with "friction" (meaning "the resistance that one surface or object encounters when moving over another"). It refers to the friction or conflict that occurs between things, people, or ideas.  The term often implies a reciprocal or mutual interaction, suggesting that the friction is not one-sided but involves a dynamic interplay between the parties involved.  |The interfriction between the two departments hindered the project's progress.  部门之间的摩擦阻碍了项目的进展。|conflict, clash, dissension, friction|harmony, agreement, concord|名词
