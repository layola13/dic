词源:
The word "mournful" comes from the Old French word "morneful", which itself originates from the Old French adjective "morne," meaning "dark, gloomy, dull".  The suffix "-ful" adds the sense of "full of" or "characterized by".  Therefore, "mournful" literally means "full of mourning" or "characterized by sorrow".
