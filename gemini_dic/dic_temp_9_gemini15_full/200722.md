The word "sleeted" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a very rare, regional, or newly coined word.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To help, I need more context on where you encountered this word.  Was it in a book, a conversation, or online?  Knowing the source might help determine its intended meaning and allow for a closer approximation of its analysis.
