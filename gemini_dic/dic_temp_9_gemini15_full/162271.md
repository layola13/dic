preabundances:/ˌpriːəˈbʌndənsɪz/| n. |过剩；过量；超额 |The word "preabundances" is a relatively rare word, referring to an excessive or surplus amount of something that exists *before* a particular point in time or event. It emphasizes the abundance that existed *prior* to a specific occurrence.  It suggests a state of superfluity that predates a given situation.  There is no established single perfect synonym. The meaning is best captured by careful phrasing using words like "prior excess," "previous surplus," or "preexisting abundance."  There is no direct antonym, as the opposite would involve a lack of abundance before the event, rather than a simple absence of excess. | 例句：The preabundances of resources in the region led to complacency before the drought. = 该地区资源的过剩导致在干旱来临之前人们过于自满。

The preabundances of grain in the previous harvest contributed to the kingdom’s prosperity before the war. = 之前的丰收使得王国在战争爆发前更加繁荣。|近义词：prior excess, previous surplus, preexisting abundance |反义词：None (opposite would describe scarcity before the event, not simply less excess) |名词
