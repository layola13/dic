declinator:/ˈdɛklɪneɪtər/| n. |偏转器，衰减器|A declinator is a device or instrument that causes a decline or decrease in something, often used in technical contexts such as electronics or astronomy.  It can refer to something that reduces the intensity of a signal or alters its direction. |The astronomer used a declinator to adjust the telescope's position. 天文学家使用偏转器来调整望远镜的位置。|近义词：reducer, attenuator, deflector |反义词：amplifier, intensifier


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The declinator reduces the signal strength. = 偏转器降低了信号强度。
The new declinator regulates the flow of data. = 新的偏转器调节数据流。


一般过去时:
The old declinator failed to adjust the beam accurately. = 旧的偏转器未能精确地调整光束。
The engineer calibrated the declinator yesterday. = 工程师昨天校准了偏转器。


现在完成时:
They have installed a new declinator in the system. = 他们已经在系统中安装了一个新的偏转器。
We have successfully tested the declinator's performance. = 我们已经成功测试了偏转器的性能。


过去完成时:
The problem had been caused by a faulty declinator. = 问题是由一个有故障的偏转器引起的。
Before the upgrade, the old declinator had been malfunctioning for weeks. = 在升级之前，旧的偏转器已经故障了几周。


将来时:
They will install a more powerful declinator next week. = 他们下周将安装一个更强大的偏转器。
The technicians will test the declinator's functionality tomorrow. = 技术人员明天将测试偏转器的功能。


虚拟语气:
If we had a better declinator, we could achieve higher precision. = 如果我们有一个更好的偏转器，我们可以达到更高的精度。
I wish the declinator had been working properly during the experiment. = 我希望偏转器在实验期间能正常工作。


被动语态:
