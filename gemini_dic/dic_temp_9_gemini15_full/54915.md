词源:  The word "disposed" comes from the verb "dispose," meaning "to arrange, settle, or prepare."  The "to" is a preposition indicating direction or inclination.  The original sense is of being "arranged" or "set" towards a particular state or action. This meaning evolved to the current sense of having a tendency or inclination.  The root is the Old French *disposer* and ultimately from the Latin *disponere*,  meaning "to set in order, arrange."
