Etymology:

The word "lubberly" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "lubber," meaning a lazy, idle person.  This term itself has uncertain origins, but is possibly connected to a now-obsolete Dutch word suggesting a clumsy or awkward person. The suffix "-ly" transforms the noun "lubber" into an adjective, describing a quality or characteristic associated with a lubber.  Thus, "lubberly" describes someone who exhibits the characteristics of a lubber – clumsiness, awkwardness, and a lack of refinement.
