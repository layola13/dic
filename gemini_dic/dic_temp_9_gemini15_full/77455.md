gay:/ɡeɪ/| adj., n.|快乐的；同性恋的；鲜艳的|

英文解析:As an adjective, "gay" traditionally meant "happy" or "merry." However, since the late 20th century, it has become predominantly associated with homosexuality, referring to a person whose sexual orientation is toward people of the same sex.  As a noun, it refers to a homosexual person (though this usage can be considered outdated and potentially offensive by some).  It can also still be used in its older sense to describe something bright and cheerful in color.
