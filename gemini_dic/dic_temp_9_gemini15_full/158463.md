词源:
The word "pledge" comes from the Old French word "pleige," meaning "a surety, a hostage,"  which ultimately derives from the Latin word "plico," meaning "to fold" or "to bend."  The original sense was related to the act of folding hands in a gesture of promise or agreement, or the giving of a hostage as a guarantee.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the promise or guarantee itself.
