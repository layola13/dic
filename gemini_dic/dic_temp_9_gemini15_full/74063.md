fossilation:/ˌfɒsɪˈleɪʃən/| n.|化石化；石化作用|The process by which organic matter is converted into a fossil.  This involves a series of complex chemical and physical changes. |例句：The fossilation of dinosaur bones is a slow process. 恐龙骨骼的化石化是一个缓慢的过程。
The rapid burial of the organism is crucial for fossilation. 快速掩埋生物体对于化石化至关重要。|近义词：petrification, fossilization|反义词：decomposition, decay|名词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Fossilation occurs over millions of years. = 化石化需要数百万年的时间。
The process of fossilation is complex and not fully understood. = 化石化过程复杂且尚未完全了解。


一般过去时:
Rapid burial significantly aided fossilation in this case. = 在这种情况下，快速掩埋极大地促进了化石化。
Scientists studied the conditions that led to the fossilation of the ancient plant. = 科学家研究了导致远古植物化石化的条件。


现在完成时:
Researchers have discovered many fossils through the study of fossilation. = 研究人员通过对化石化的研究发现了许多化石。
Scientists have learned much about past environments through the analysis of fossilation. = 科学家通过化石化分析了解了过去的环境。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, little was known about the factors affecting fossilation in this region. = 在发现之前，人们对影响该地区化石化的因素知之甚少。
The researchers had hypothesized that the rapid changes in temperature had influenced the fossilation process. = 研究人员假设温度的快速变化影响了化石化过程。


将来时:
Further research will help us better understand the mechanisms of fossilation. = 进一步的研究将帮助我们更好地了解化石化的机制。
Scientists will continue to study fossils to learn more about fossilation. = 科学家将继续研究化石，以了解更多关于化石化的知识。


虚拟语气:
If the conditions had been different, fossilation might not have occurred. = 如果条件不同，化石化可能不会发生。
It is believed that if the organism had not been buried quickly, fossilation would have been less likely. = 人们认为，如果生物体没有被迅速掩埋，化石化发生的可能性就会降低。


被动语态:
The fossil was formed through the process of fossilation. = 化石是通过化石化过程形成的。
Many details of the fossilation process are still being investigated. = 化石化过程的许多细节仍在研究中。


疑问句:
What conditions are necessary for fossilation to occur? = 化石化发生需要什么条件？
How long does the process of fossilation typically take? = 化石化过程通常需要多长时间？


否定句:
Not all organisms undergo complete fossilation. = 并非所有生物体都会经历完全的化石化。
The lack of oxygen hindered the fossilation of soft tissues. = 缺氧阻碍了软组织的化石化。


PHRASE->
