词源:
The word is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "diplomatic."  "Diplomatic" comes from the French word "diplomatique," ultimately derived from the Greek word "diploma" (a document conferring authority or privilege).  Therefore, "nondiplomatic" literally means "not relating to or characteristic of diplomacy."
