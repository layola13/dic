ETYMOLOGY->

The word "overbearingnesses" is formed from:

* **overbearing:** This adjective combines "over" (meaning excessively or to a great extent) and "bearing" (meaning conduct, demeanor, or manner).  "Bearing" itself originates from Old English "beran," meaning "to carry," but has evolved to encompass the sense of how one carries themselves.

* **-ness:** This suffix is added to adjectives to create nouns signifying a state, quality, or condition.


Therefore, "overbearingnesses" literally means "the state or quality of being excessively domineering or controlling in one's behavior."
