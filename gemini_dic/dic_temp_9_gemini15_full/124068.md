Morphs are the surface forms, while morphs are the abstract underlying units.|The plural of "cat" is "cats," showing the morphon /s/ representing the plural morpheme.

USAGE->
This word is primarily used in linguistics and theoretical phonology.  It doesn't have common usage in everyday conversation. Therefore, providing examples across various grammatical tenses is not applicable.  The concept is explained through the illustrative examples below.

Example 1:
The morpheme "plural" can be realized as the morphon /-s/ in "cats," /-z/ in "dogs," and /-əz/ in "buses."  This shows how the same morpheme (plural) has different phonetic realizations (morphons) depending on the preceding sound. = 语素“复数”可以被实现为音位形态 /-s/ 在“cats”中， /-z/ 在“dogs”中， /-əz/ 在“buses”中。这展示了相同的语素（复数）如何在不同的环境下有不同的语音实现（音位形态）。


Example 2:
The past tense morpheme in English has several morphons.  For example, "-ed" can be pronounced as /t/ (walked), /d/ (played), or /ɪd/ (wanted). The choice depends on the final sound of the verb stem. =英语中的过去时态语素有几个音位形态。“-ed”可以发音为/t/（walked），/d/（played）或/ɪd/（wanted）。选择取决于动词词干的结尾音。
