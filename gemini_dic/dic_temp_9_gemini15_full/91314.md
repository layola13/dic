hydromica: /ˌhaɪdroʊˈmaɪkə/ | n. |水云母|A group of hydrous phyllosilicate minerals, intermediate between micas and clays, characterized by a layered structure and swelling properties when exposed to water.  They are often found in altered volcanic rocks and are used in various industrial applications.|例句：Hydromica clays are used as drilling muds due to their swelling properties. 水云母粘土由于其膨胀特性被用作钻井泥浆。  The analysis revealed a significant presence of hydromica in the rock sample. 分析显示岩石样本中存在大量水云母。|近义词：illite (similar clay mineral)|反义词：N/A|名词
