词源:
The word "positiveness" derives from the adjective "positive," which comes from the Latin word "positivus," meaning "placed," "set," or "affirmed."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun indicating a state or quality.  The evolution reflects the shift from the literal placement of something to the abstract sense of affirmation and optimism.
