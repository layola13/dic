promeristem:/ˈproʊməˌrɪstəm/ | n. | 原分生组织 |  Promeristem refers to the very early, embryonic meristematic tissue found in the apical regions of plants. It's the initial meristematic tissue from which all other meristems develop. Unlike other meristems, it is characterized by its less organized structure and relatively undifferentiated cells.  These cells are capable of extensive cell division and differentiation, giving rise to all other tissues and organs of the plant. | Example: The promeristem in the shoot apex is responsible for the formation of the leaves and stems.  原分生组织在芽顶负责形成叶和茎。 | 近义词:apical meristem, initial meristem | 反义词:mature tissue, differentiated tissue |
