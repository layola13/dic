词源:

The word "improvisation" comes from the French word "improvisation," which itself is derived from the Latin verb "improvisare," meaning "to compose or perform extempore."  The prefix "im-" means "in" or "upon," and "provisare"  is related to "providere," meaning "to provide" or "to foresee."  Therefore, the original meaning hints at creating something "on the spot," without prior provision or planning.
