词源:
The word "decry" comes from the Old French word "decrier," which means "to cry down," "to clamor against," or "to denounce."  The prefix "de-" means "down" or "away," and the root "-cry" relates to shouting or making a loud noise.  Thus, the original meaning involved publicly and loudly expressing disapproval.
