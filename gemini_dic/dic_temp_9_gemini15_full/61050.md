1. **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **A name:**  "Elke" is a common name, primarily of German origin.

3. **A word from another language:**  "Elke" might be a word from a language other than English.


If you can provide more context (sentence, source, etc.), I can offer a more accurate response.
