词源:
The word "serene" comes from the Latin word "serēnus," meaning "clear," "bright," "calm," or "tranquil."  The Latin word itself has roots in the Proto-Italic *ser- and possibly related to the Proto-Indo-European root *ser- (to bind, connect, or protect).  The connection to the sense of calmness may stem from the association of a clear, bright sky with a peaceful, undisturbed atmosphere.
