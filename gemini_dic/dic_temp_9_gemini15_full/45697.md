词源:
The word "curvaceous" comes from the word "curve," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "curvus," meaning "bent" or "crooked."  The suffix "-aceous" indicates "having the nature of" or "resembling."  Therefore, "curvaceous" literally means "having curves" or "resembling curves," especially in a pleasing and attractive way.
