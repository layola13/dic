oversystematized: /ˌoʊvərˈsɪstəmətaɪzd/ | adj. | 过度系统化的；过于系统化的 |  The adjective "oversystematized" describes something that has been subjected to excessive systematization, often to the point of being rigid, inflexible, or counterproductive. It implies that the system in place is too complex, overly structured, or has lost its intended efficiency or effectiveness due to over-organization.


英文解析:  The word is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively"), the noun "system" (a coordinated body of principles, rules, and procedures), and the suffix "-atized" (meaning "to make or become something").  Therefore, "oversystematized" means that a system has been made excessively systematic, leading to negative consequences.
