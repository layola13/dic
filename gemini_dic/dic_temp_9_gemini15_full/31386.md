词源:
The word "charge" ultimately derives from the Old French word "charger," meaning "to load" or "to burden." This in turn comes from the Vulgar Latin *carricare, a derivative of  carrus, meaning "cart" or "wagon." The original sense was thus related to the loading of a cart or wagon. Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass its various modern senses.
