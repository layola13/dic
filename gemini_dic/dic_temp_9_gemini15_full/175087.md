radiothorium: /ˌreɪdiəʊˈθɔːriəm/ | n. | 镭钍 |  Radiothorium is a naturally occurring radioactive isotope of thorium.  It's a decay product of thorium-232 and is itself a parent isotope in the thorium decay series. It's characterized by its strong radioactivity and relatively short half-life.  It has limited practical applications due to its radioactivity and the availability of other, safer isotopes. |  The sample contained a significant amount of radiothorium. 这个样本含有大量的镭钍。


The properties of radiothorium were extensively studied in the early days of nuclear physics. 对镭钍的特性在核物理学的早期进行了广泛的研究。


近义词:  (No perfect synonyms, as it's a specific isotope)  thorium isotope, radioactive isotope


反义词: (No direct antonyms, but opposites in terms of properties could be considered):  stable isotope, non-radioactive element
