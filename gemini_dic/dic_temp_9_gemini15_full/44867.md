The word "cruy" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  A word with that spelling is likely either a proper noun (a name), a misspelling, a word from a very specialized or obscure dialect, or a neologism (newly coined word).  To help me assist you, please provide more context where you encountered this word.
