词源:
The word "mould" comes from the Old English word "mūld," meaning "earth," "soil," or "dust."  This reflects the early association with the earthy nature of fungi.  Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass the process of shaping things and the containers used in that process.  The spelling evolved through Middle English.
