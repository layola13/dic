词源:

From Latin *dubietas, from dubitare "to doubt".  The suffix -ies is a pluralizing suffix, though the word often functions as a singular collective noun.


用法说明:

Dubieties is a plural noun, but it often refers to a collection of doubts or uncertainties considered as a single entity.  It implies a significant level of uncertainty or hesitation, often regarding a specific issue or decision.  It suggests a more formal and intellectual form of doubt than words like "doubts".
