The word "maray" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a name (person, place, or thing) specific to a certain region or context.
* **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.
* **It's a newly coined word or slang:**  New words are constantly emerging, but without more context, it's difficult to determine if this is the case.


To get a proper analysis, please provide more context where you encountered this word.  For example:

* The sentence where you saw it.
* The source (book, website, conversation).
* Any other information about the context.
