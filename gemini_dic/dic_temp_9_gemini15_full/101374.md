ionosphere:/aɪˈɒnəsfɪər/| n. |电离层|The ionosphere is a region of the Earth's upper atmosphere, from about 60 to 1000 kilometers in altitude, where the air is ionized by solar radiation. It plays a crucial role in radio wave propagation.  |Example: The ionosphere reflects radio waves, allowing long-distance communication.  电离层反射无线电波，从而实现远距离通信。|近义词：thermosphere (部分重叠)|反义词：troposphere, stratosphere|名词

词源:

The word "ionosphere" is a combination of "ion" and "sphere."  "Ion" comes from the Greek word ἰόν (ion), meaning "going," referring to the migrating charged particles. "Sphere" comes from the Greek word σφαῖρα (sphaira), meaning "ball" or "globe."  Therefore, "ionosphere" literally means "the sphere of ions."
