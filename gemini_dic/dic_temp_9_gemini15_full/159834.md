polyhedra: /ˌpɒliˈhiːdrə/ /ˌpɑːliˈhiːdrə/ | n. |多面体 | A polyhedron is a three-dimensional geometric shape with flat polygonal faces, straight edges, and sharp corners or vertices.  It's formed by joining polygons along their edges.  Polyhedra can be regular (all faces are congruent regular polygons) or irregular. |  Examples include cubes, pyramids, and prisms.  The study of polyhedra is a significant part of geometry and has applications in various fields, from architecture to crystallography. |近义词：polygons (in a sense, lower dimension)|反义词：sphere (a curved surface)


例句：

Regular polyhedra are fascinating geometric objects. = 正多面体是令人着迷的几何物体。

He built a model of a complex polyhedron for his math project. = 他为他的数学项目制作了一个复杂多面体的模型。

PHRASE->

regular polyhedra = 正多面体
irregular polyhedra = 不规则多面体
Platonic solids = 柏拉图多面体
convex polyhedra = 凸多面体
concave polyhedra = 凹多面体


词源:

The word "polyhedra" comes from the Greek words "poly" (πολύς, meaning "many") and "hedra" (ἕδρα, meaning "base" or "seat").  Therefore, it literally means "many bases" or "many faces".  The singular form is "polyhedron".
