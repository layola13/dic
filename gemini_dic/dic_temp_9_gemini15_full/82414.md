ETYMOLOGY->
The word "gruel" comes from the Old French word "gruel," which in turn may derive from the Late Latin word "gruellus," a diminutive of "grus," meaning "crane."  The connection to cranes is unclear, but might relate to the long, thin consistency of the porridge resembling a crane's neck.  Another possible origin is from the Old North French "grue," meaning "gruel" or "porridge."  The meaning has evolved over time, but it has always related to a type of watery porridge.
