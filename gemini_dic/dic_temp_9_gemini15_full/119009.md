词源:

The word derives from "methodical," which in turn comes from "method" + "-ical" (adjective suffix). "Method" originates from the Greek word "methodos," meaning "a way of pursuing," "a way of following," combining "meta" (after, along, with) and "hodos" (way, road).  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "methodical" into a noun, indicating a state or quality.  The plural "-es" is added to denote multiple methodical approaches or qualities.
