词源:
The word "dispirited" comes from the Old French word "despiriter," which is composed of the prefix "de-" (meaning "away from" or "removal of") and "spiriter" (meaning "to encourage" or "to give spirit").  Therefore, "dispirited" literally means "deprived of spirit" or "having spirit taken away".
