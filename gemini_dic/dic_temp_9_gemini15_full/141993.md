词源:
The word "organisation" comes from the French word "organisation," which in turn derives from the Greek word "organon" (ὄργανον), meaning "tool" or "instrument."  The concept evolved to include the idea of a structured body or system working together to achieve a goal.  The English word adopted the spelling "organisation" (with a "s") from the French.  The spelling "organization" (without the "s") is also widely used, particularly in American English.
