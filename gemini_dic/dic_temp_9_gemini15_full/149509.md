词源:

The word "paedophile" comes from the Greek words "pais" (παις), meaning "child," and "philos" (φίλος), meaning "loving."  Therefore, the literal meaning is "child-loving," though the term's usage is strictly limited to describing individuals with a sexual attraction to prepubescent children.  The term's usage is controversial due to its perceived euphemism and is increasingly replaced by more direct and accurate terms.
