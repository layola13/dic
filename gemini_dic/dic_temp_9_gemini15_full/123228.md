Etymology:

The word "monocotyledonous" is derived from the following components:

* **mono-:**  From Greek "monos," meaning "single" or "one."
* **cotyl-:** From Greek "kotylē," meaning "cup" or "cavity," referring to the cotyledon.
* **-edon:** From Greek "-ēdon," a suffix indicating a diminutive or offspring.
