词源:
The word "groovily" is derived from the adjective "groovy," which emerged in the 1960s counterculture. "Groovy" initially meant "excellent" or "wonderful" in a hip, informal way.  Its origins are uncertain, but it's likely connected to the musical term "groove," referring to a rhythmic feel or a catchy musical passage.  The "-ily" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating how something is done.
