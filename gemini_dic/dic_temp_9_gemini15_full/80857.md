词源:
The verb "gourmandized" is derived from the noun "gourmand," meaning a person who enjoys eating and drinking fine foods and drinks, often to excess.  The suffix "-ized" transforms the noun into a verb, indicating the act of behaving like a gourmand.  The word ultimately traces back to Old French *gourmand, from *goulant, meaning "gluttonous."
