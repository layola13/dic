词源:  The word "conductor" comes from the Latin word "conductor," meaning "leader" or "guide."  This reflects its use in various contexts, from leading a musical ensemble to guiding passengers on public transport.  The scientific usage, referring to materials that conduct electricity or heat, evolved later, based on the concept of guiding or facilitating the flow of these energies.
