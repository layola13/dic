predicativity: /ˌprɛdɪkˈtɪvɪti/ | n. |谓词性，谓语性 | The quality or state of being predicative; the ability to function as a predicate.  It refers to the capacity of a linguistic element (typically a word or phrase) to function as the predicate of a sentence, expressing something about the subject.  This concept is central to the study of grammar and semantics. | Example:  The sentence "The cat is sleeping" demonstrates high predicativity, with "is sleeping" acting as the predicate describing the cat. The predicativity of this sentence is clear. |近义词: predicability, assertion |反义词:  non-predicativity (This is less commonly used as a direct antonym; the opposite concept is usually expressed by describing something as non-predicative or lacking predicative function.)


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in linguistic analysis and doesn't have typical verb conjugations like "to be" or "to go".  Therefore, tense and other verb conjugations are not applicable.  Instead, its usage is demonstrated through examples within sentences.


Example 1 (High Predicativity):
The sun is shining brightly. = 太阳正在明亮地照耀着。


Example 2 (Low Predicativity):
The book. = 这本书。(This lacks a predicate and therefore has low predicativity)


Example 3 (Focus on Predicative Element):
In the sentence "The bird sang beautifully," the predicativity is high because "sang beautifully" clearly predicates something about the bird.


Example 4 (Comparative Predicativity):
"The car is red" has higher predicativity than "The red car," because the former explicitly states a predicative relationship.


Example 5 (Absence of Predicativity):
A simple noun phrase like "a beautiful sunset" lacks predicativity as it is not a complete sentence with a predicate.


PHRASE->
There aren't common idiomatic phrases directly using "predicativity". The term is primarily used in a technical, linguistic context. However, related concepts are expressed through phrases like:

Phrase 1: Makes a statement about = 表达关于...的陈述 (This highlights the predicative function)

Phrase 2: Describes the subject = 描述主语 (This reflects the core function of a predicate)

Phrase 3: Is predicated on = 以...为基础 (This relates to the dependence of a predicate on a subject)

Phrase 4: Has a clear predicate = 有一个清晰的谓语 (This is a direct description of high predicativity)

Phrase 5:  Lacks predicative force = 缺乏谓语作用 (This describes low or absent predicativity)
