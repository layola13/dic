词源:  The word is formed by adding the suffix "-istic" to "radical."  "Radical" itself originates from the Latin word "radix," meaning "root."  In its original sense, "radical" referred to something fundamental or pertaining to the root.  Its application to politics and social movements came later, signifying a fundamental or thoroughgoing change. The addition of "-istic" intensifies the meaning, implying an adherence to or embodiment of radical principles to an extreme degree.
