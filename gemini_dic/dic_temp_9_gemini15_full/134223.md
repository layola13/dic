词源:  The word is a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") + "industrialized" (meaning "having undergone industrialization").  "Industrialized" itself derives from "industry" (from Old French "industrie," ultimately from Latin "industria," meaning "diligence, skill, activity") + "-ized" (a suffix forming adjectives meaning "made or rendered").
