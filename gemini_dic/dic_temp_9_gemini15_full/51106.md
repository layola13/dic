词源:

The word "despicability" is derived from the adjective "despicable," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "despicere," meaning "to look down upon," "to despise," or "to scorn."  The suffix "-ability" transforms the adjective into a noun indicating the quality or capacity of being despicable.
