词源:

The word "noncondemnations" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the word "condemnations".  "Condemnations" is derived from the verb "condemn", which comes from the Old French "condamner" and ultimately from the Latin "condemnare" (to condemn, sentence).  The suffix "-ations" turns the verb into a noun, indicating the act or instance of condemning.  Therefore, "noncondemnations" literally means "not condemning" or "the absence of condemnations".
