词源：

The word "institutionalized" comes from the noun "institution," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "instituere," meaning "to establish, set up, found."  The suffix "-ized" indicates the process of making something into the state described by the root word.  Therefore, "institutionalized" literally means "made into an institution" or "established as a norm or standard within an institution."
