self-solicitudes: /ˌsɛlf səˈlɪsɪtuːdz/ | n. | 自我恳求；自我慰藉；自怜自艾 |  This word is not a standard or commonly used word in English. It's likely a newly coined word or a very rare usage.  It combines "self" with "solicitudes," which refers to anxieties, concerns, or worries.  Therefore, "self-solicitudes" could be interpreted as anxieties or worries directed inward, towards oneself; a preoccupation with one's own problems or feelings of self-pity.  There's no established dictionary definition or widespread usage to provide specific examples, near synonyms, or antonyms.  The grammatical usage would follow standard noun usage.
