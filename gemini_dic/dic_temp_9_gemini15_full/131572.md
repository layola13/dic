noncommutative: /ˌnɒnkəˈmjuːtətɪv/ | adj. | 非交换的 |

英文解析:  In mathematics, particularly in algebra, noncommutative refers to an operation where changing the order of the operands changes the result.  This is in contrast to commutative operations, where the order does not matter.  For example, addition is commutative (2 + 3 = 3 + 2), but subtraction is not (2 - 3 ≠ 3 - 2).  The term is often used in relation to abstract algebra and matrix multiplication.

例句:

Matrix multiplication is a noncommutative operation.  = 矩阵乘法是一种非交换运算。

The composition of functions is generally noncommutative. = 函数的复合运算通常是非交换的。
