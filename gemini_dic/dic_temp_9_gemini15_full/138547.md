The word "noyman" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a proper noun:  Is it a name, a place, or a brand?
* It's a neologism:  Is it a newly coined word, specific to a certain field or community?
* It's from another language:  Could you provide the language of origin?

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you'd like me to help.
