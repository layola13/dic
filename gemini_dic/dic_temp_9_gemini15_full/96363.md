The word "indis" does not exist in standard English.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a detailed analysis according to your requested format.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a word from a specialized field, or a word from a different language.  If you can provide more context (e.g., the sentence it appeared in, the source where you found it), I might be able to help you figure out what word you intended.
