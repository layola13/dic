interambulacrum: /ˌɪntəræmˈbjuːləkrəm/ | n. |步带区，间步带 |

英文解析:In echinoderms (such as starfish and sea urchins), an interambulacrum is one of the areas of the body surface that lie between the ambulacra (the areas containing the tube feet).  It's characterized by the absence of tube feet and often has a different texture or pattern compared to the ambulacra.

例句:
The interambulacrum of this sea urchin is noticeably wider than its ambulacra. = 这个海胆的步带区明显比它的辐部宽。

The researcher carefully examined the interambulacra to identify the species of starfish. = 研究人员仔细检查了间步带以识别海星的种类。
