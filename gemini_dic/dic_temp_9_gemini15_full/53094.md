diphthongation:/ˌdɪpθɒŋˈɡeɪʃən/ | n. | 双元音化 | The process of a vowel sound becoming a diphthong.  It refers to the linguistic phenomenon where a previously monophthongal vowel sound develops into a diphthong, involving a glide from one vowel quality to another within a single syllable.  This can occur through various phonetic changes in the evolution of a language. | Example: The Great Vowel Shift in English involved the diphthongation of many long vowels.  The pronunciation of the vowel in "name" in many dialects evolved from a pure vowel to a diphthong. | 近义词: diphthongization | 反义词: monophthongization
