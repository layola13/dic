词源:

The word derives from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"),  "expert" (meaning "skilled, knowledgeable"), and the suffix "-ness" (indicating a state or quality).  Therefore, "inexpertness" literally means "the state of not being expert."  The plural form simply adds "-es" to indicate multiple instances of this state.
