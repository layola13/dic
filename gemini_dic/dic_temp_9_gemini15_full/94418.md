implicitly:/ɪmˈplɪsɪtli/ | adv. | 暗中地；含蓄地；暗示地 |  The contract implicitly requires payment within 30 days.  (合同暗含30天内付款的要求。)  |近义词：indirectly, tacitly, by implication | 反义词：explicitly, directly


Word Origin:

The word "implicitly" comes from the Latin word "implicitus," meaning "folded up," "entangled," or "involved."  This reflects the sense of something being understood or suggested without being directly stated. The prefix "im-" means "in" or "into," and "plicare" means "to fold."


Usage:

The adverb "implicitly" modifies a verb, adjective, or another adverb, indicating that something is implied or understood without being explicitly stated.  It suggests a hidden or indirect meaning.


Examples:

* **Sentence with a verb:** He implicitly agreed to the terms by his silence. (他沉默不语，暗示同意了条款。)

* **Sentence with an adjective:**  The instructions were implicitly clear, though not explicitly written. (说明虽然没有明确写出来，但含蓄地很清楚。)

* **Sentence with another adverb:** She implicitly understood the seriousness of the situation. (她含蓄地理解了局势的严重性。)



There is no need to demonstrate verb tenses, passive voice, etc., for adverbs. Adverbs don't conjugate in the same way verbs do.  They don't have tenses or voice. The examples above illustrate the different ways "implicitly" can be used in a sentence.

Phrases:

While "implicitly" itself doesn't form common multi-word phrases in the same way as a noun or verb might, its meaning frequently appears in phrasal contexts like:

1. implicitly trust:  完全信任
2. implicitly obey:  绝对服从
3. implicitly believe:  深信不疑
4. implicitly follow:  严格遵守
5. implicitly understand:  心领神会
