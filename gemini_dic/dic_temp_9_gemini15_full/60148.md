词源:
The word "effectuating" derives from the verb "effectuate," which comes from the late Middle English word "effectuen," meaning "to bring about; to accomplish."  This, in turn, is derived from the Latin word "effectuare," which combines "effectus" (effect, result) and the verb suffix "-are" (to do or make).  Therefore, the root meaning points to the creation or realization of an effect or result.
