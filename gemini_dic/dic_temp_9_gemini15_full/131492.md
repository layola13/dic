noncollapsibility: /ˌnɒnkəˈlæpsəˈbɪləti/ | n. |不可坍缩性，不可崩溃性 | The inability of a structure or system to collapse or break down.  This term often arises in the context of statistical analysis, referring to the situation where a relationship between variables observed in a stratified sample differs from the relationship observed in the unstratified sample.  It implies that a naive analysis (ignoring stratification) can lead to inaccurate conclusions.  | Example: The noncollapsibility of the odds ratio is a well-known problem in epidemiology.  The observed association between smoking and lung cancer might be different if we analyze it within subgroups defined by age or gender. |近义词:  stability, robustness, resilience | 反义词: collapsibility, fragility
