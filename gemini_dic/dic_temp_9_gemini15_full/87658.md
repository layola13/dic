hexadecapole:/ˌhɛksəˈdɛkəpoʊl/| n. |十六极子|A hexadecapole is a multipole of order six in a multipole expansion. It describes a system with 16 poles, representing a more complex distribution of charge or mass than a dipole, quadrupole, or octupole.  The term is used in physics, particularly in electromagnetism and gravitation, to describe the higher-order terms in the expansion of a potential field.  Hexadecapoles are rarely encountered in everyday situations as their effects are typically small compared to lower-order multipoles.|Example:  The gravitational field of a slightly distorted celestial body can be described using a multipole expansion, including hexadecapole components. = 一个略微扭曲的天体的引力场可以用多极展开来描述，包括十六极分量。 The detailed analysis of the hexadecapole moment is crucial for understanding the subtle gravitational interactions between celestial bodies. = 对十六极矩的详细分析对于理解天体之间微妙的引力相互作用至关重要。|近义词:multipole (more general term)|反义词:monopole (simplest term)
