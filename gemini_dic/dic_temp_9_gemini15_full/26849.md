The word "cairnier" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the original source?  Perhaps it's "carnier," "cairn," or a similar word.

2. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a surname or place name, but without more context, it's impossible to say.

3. **It's a neologism or dialect word:**  It might be a newly coined word or a word specific to a particular region or community.  Again, context is crucial.

4. **It's a made-up word:**  It may have been invented for a specific purpose (e.g., in fiction).

Because "cairnier" doesn't exist in standard English, I cannot provide the requested analysis (phonetics, word class, definition, etc.).  Please provide more context or clarify the spelling.  If you can provide the sentence or text where you encountered this word, it might be possible to determine its intended meaning and offer a proper analysis.
