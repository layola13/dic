词源:
From contumacious + -ly.  Contumacious comes from Late Latin *contumax, from Latin contumacia "stubbornness, obstinacy," from contumex, contumax "stubborn, disobedient," from con- "together" + tumeo "to swell," "to be swollen with pride" (related to Latin tumere "to swell").  The sense development is from "swollen with pride" to "rebellious," then to "stubbornly disobedient."
