Etymological Note:

"Crabbedness" derives from the adjective "crabbed," meaning ill-tempered or peevish.  "Crabbed" itself originates from the Old English word "crabba," meaning "crab."  The connection lies in the association of crabs with sideways movement and a perceived unpleasantness or difficulty in dealing with them, mirroring the difficult and unpleasant nature of a crabbed individual.
