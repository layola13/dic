用法说明：

"Issuably" indicates that something is potentially or arguably true, but not definitively so. It implies a degree of uncertainty or contestability.  It is less common than words like "possibly" or "arguably," but conveys a specific nuance of something being open to question as an issue.  It is often used in legal or academic contexts where the matter at hand is subject to discussion or debate.
