self-stability: /ˌsɛlf ˈsteɪbɪləti/ | n. | 自稳定性 | The ability of a system or structure to maintain its equilibrium or stability without external intervention.  It implies an inherent capacity to resist disturbances and return to its original state.  For example, a self-stable ecosystem can recover from minor disruptions without human intervention.  | The self-stability of the bridge is crucial for its longevity.  桥梁的自稳定性对其寿命至关重要。

The remarkable self-stability of the economy surprised many experts.  经济的显著自稳定性令许多专家感到惊讶。|  stability, equilibrium, resilience | instability, fragility, volatility |  noun
