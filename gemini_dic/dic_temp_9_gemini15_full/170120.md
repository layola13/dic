protococcus:/ˌproʊtəˈkɒkəs/|/ˈproʊtəˌkɑːkəs/| n. |原球藻属|A genus of green algae, typically forming colonies on damp surfaces.  Members of this genus are single-celled and often found in moist environments, such as tree bark or rocks. They are characterized by their spherical or ovoid shape and their ability to reproduce asexually through cell division. |Example: Protococcus viridis is a common species found on tree trunks. 原球藻绿色是一种常见于树干上的物种。|近义词:Chlorella (but Chlorella is a different genus)|反义词:|
