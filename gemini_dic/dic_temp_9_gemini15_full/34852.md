clinkering: /ˈklɪŋkərɪŋ/ | n. | 熔渣；结块；(炉膛内)结渣 | The process or result of forming a hard, fused mass, especially in a furnace or kiln.  Clinkering refers to the formation of hard, fused masses of material, typically from ash or other residue, during combustion or high-temperature processes. This often occurs in furnaces, kilns, and boilers.  | Example: The clinkering in the boiler reduced its efficiency.  炉膛内的结渣降低了锅炉的效率。  The incomplete combustion led to excessive clinkering in the furnace. 不完全燃烧导致炉膛内结渣过多。|近义词：agglomeration, sintering, fusion |反义词：pulverization, disintegration |名词
