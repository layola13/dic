词源:  The word "lewd" ultimately derives from the Old English word "lēw," meaning "lay," "common," or "unlearned."  Over time, its meaning shifted to imply something vulgar or unrefined, eventually settling on its current association with sexual impropriety.  The semantic change likely reflects societal shifts in attitudes towards sexuality and social norms.
