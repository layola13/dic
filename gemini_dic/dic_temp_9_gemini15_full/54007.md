词源:

The word "discriminatorily" is derived from the adjective "discriminatory," which itself comes from the verb "discriminate."  "Discriminate" comes from the Latin word "discernere," meaning "to separate," "to distinguish," or "to discern." The prefix "dis-" adds a negative or separating connotation in this context, leading to the sense of making unfair distinctions or separations between groups of people.
