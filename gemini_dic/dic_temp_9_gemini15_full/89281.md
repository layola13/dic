homodermy:/hoʊˈmɑːdərmi/ | n. |同温性，恒温性 |The ability of an organism to maintain a constant body temperature regardless of external temperature fluctuations.  This is achieved through physiological mechanisms such as sweating, shivering, and changes in blood flow.  Homodermy is characteristic of endothermic organisms, including mammals and birds. |Example: Mammals exhibit homodermy, maintaining a relatively stable internal temperature despite changes in ambient conditions.  哺乳动物表现出同温性，即使环境条件发生变化，也能保持相对稳定的体温。|近义词：homeothermy|反义词：poikilothermy
