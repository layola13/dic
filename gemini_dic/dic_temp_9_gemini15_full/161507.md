potentiometric:/ˌpəʊtɛnʃiəˈmɛtrɪk/ | adj. | 电位测定的；电势测量的 | Relating to or using potentiometry, a method of electrochemical measurement.  Potentiometry measures the electrical potential difference between two electrodes in an electrochemical cell without allowing significant current to flow. This technique is widely used in analytical chemistry to determine the concentration of ions in a solution or to monitor changes in pH. | The potentiometric titration revealed a precise endpoint. 电位滴定揭示了一个精确的终点。  The sensor uses a potentiometric method to measure the pH. 传感器使用电位法测量pH值。 |  electrometric, voltametric |  (No direct antonym, as it describes a method, not a quality.) |  adj.
