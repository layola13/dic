fugue:/fjuːɡ/| n.|赋格曲，赋格；精神错乱|A fugue is a musical composition in which a melodic idea (the subject) is introduced in one part and then imitated in other parts, creating a complex interplay of voices.

The doctor diagnosed the patient with a fugue state after he was found wandering the streets with no recollection of his identity.  医生诊断病人患有精神错乱，因为他被发现徘徊在街上，不记得自己的身份。|近义词：composition (in musical context), amnesia (in clinical context) |反义词：simple melody (in musical context), lucidity (in clinical context)
