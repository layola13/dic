photon:/ˈfoʊtɑːn/|/ˈfəʊtɒn/| n. |光子|A photon is a fundamental particle of light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. It is a quantum of energy and has no mass.  Photons are characterized by their frequency (or wavelength) and their energy, which are directly proportional. They exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, a concept known as wave-particle duality.|Example:  Sunlight is composed of countless photons.  阳光是由无数光子组成的。

The energy of a single photon is directly proportional to its frequency, as described by Planck's equation: E = hf, where E is energy, h is Planck's constant, and f is frequency. |近义词:quantum of light|反义词:None.

USAGE->
一般现在时:
A photon travels at the speed of light. = 光子以光速传播。
The sun emits photons constantly. = 太阳不断地发出光子。

一般过去时:
The experiment detected a single photon. = 实验检测到单个光子。
Scientists measured the energy of the photon. = 科学家测量了光子的能量。

现在完成时:
We have observed many photons in this experiment. = 我们在这个实验中观测到许多光子。
Researchers have confirmed the wave-particle duality of photons. = 研究人员证实了光子的波粒二象性。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, they hadn't understood the nature of photons. = 在发现之前，他们并不了解光子的本质。
The theory had predicted the existence of photons. = 该理论已经预言了光子的存在。


将来时:
We will measure the polarization of the photons. = 我们将测量光子的偏振。
Scientists will explore the properties of photons further. = 科学家们将进一步探索光子的特性。


虚拟语气:
If the photon had more energy, it would have a shorter wavelength. = 如果光子能量更高，它的波长就会更短。
I wish I could see the photons with my naked eyes. = 我希望我能用肉眼看到光子。


被动语态:
The photon was detected by the sensor. = 光子被传感器检测到。
The energy of the photon was calculated accurately. = 光子的能量被精确计算出来。


疑问句:
How many photons are emitted per second? = 每秒发射多少光子？
What is the wavelength of this photon? = 这个光子的波长是多少？


否定句:
The experiment did not detect any photons. = 实验没有检测到任何光子。
The theory does not explain all properties of photons. = 该理论并没有解释光子的所有特性。


PHRASE->
photon emission = 光子发射
photon scattering = 光子散射
photon absorption = 光子吸收
photon detector = 光子探测器
photon energy = 光子能量

词源:
The word "photon" is derived from the Greek word "phos," meaning "light,"  and the suffix "-on," a common suffix used to denote particles (like electron, proton, neutron).  It was coined in 1926 by Gilbert N. Lewis.
