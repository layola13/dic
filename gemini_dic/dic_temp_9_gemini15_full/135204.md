词源:
The word "nonorthodox" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "orthodox."  "Orthodox" comes from Late Middle English: via Old French from Late Greek *orthódoxos, from orthós ‘straight, right’ + dóxa ‘opinion, belief’.  Therefore, "nonorthodox" literally means "not of right belief" or "not conforming to established doctrine."
