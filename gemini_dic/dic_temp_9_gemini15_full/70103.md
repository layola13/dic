词源:
The word "feverishly" is derived from the adjective "feverish," which itself comes from the noun "fever."  The suffix "-ish" indicates a resemblance or tendency towards a state or quality.  Therefore, "feverish" originally meant exhibiting symptoms of fever, but its meaning has expanded to encompass intense excitement and activity.
