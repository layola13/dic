oxides:/ˈɒksaɪdz/ /ˈɑːksaɪdz/ | n. | 氧化物 | A compound of oxygen with another element or group.  Oxides are formed when oxygen reacts with another element. They are extremely common and have a wide range of properties and uses. | Examples: Iron oxide (rust) is a common example of an oxide.  Water (H₂O) is an oxide of hydrogen. |近义词:  (depending on context) compound,  metal oxide, non-metal oxide | 反义词: (no direct antonym, but the opposite would be a reduction product)

词源:
The word "oxide" comes from the French word "oxyde," which itself is derived from the Greek word "oxys" (ὀξύς), meaning "sharp," "acid," or "sour," and the suffix "-ide," indicating a binary compound.  The name reflects the early association of oxides with acidic properties, although many oxides are not acidic.
