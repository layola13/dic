词源:
The word "sciatheric" is derived from the Greek words:

*  "skia" (σκιά), meaning "shade"
*  "theros" (θερος),  meaning "summer" (though often associated with warmth and sunlight, in this context it relates to the time of year when shade is most sought)

The combination suggests something related to or preferring shade, especially during warmer periods.  The "-ic" suffix transforms the root into an adjective.
