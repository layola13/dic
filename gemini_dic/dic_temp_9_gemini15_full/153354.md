penetrancy:/ˈpɛnɪtrənsi/| n. |外显率；表现度|The degree to which a particular gene or genotype is expressed in the phenotype.  It refers to the proportion of individuals carrying a particular variant (allele or genotype) who also express the associated phenotype.  A penetrance of 100% means that everyone who inherits the genotype will show the phenotype.  Penetrance can be reduced by modifier genes, environmental factors, or other genetic interactions.|Example: The penetrance of Huntington's disease is almost 100%, meaning most individuals who inherit the gene will develop the disease.  |近义词：expressivity|反义词：non-penetrance|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The penetrance of this gene is high. = 这个基因的外显率很高。
What is the penetrance of this particular trait? = 这种特定性状的外显率是多少？


一般过去时:
The penetrance of the disease was lower in previous generations. = 该疾病在之前的几代人的外显率较低。
Scientists studied the penetrance of the gene in different environments. = 科学家研究了该基因在不同环境下的外显率。


现在完成时:
Researchers have determined the penetrance of the mutation. = 研究人员已经确定了该突变的外显率。
We have observed a lower penetrance than expected. = 我们观察到的外显率低于预期。


过去完成时:
They had already known the penetrance before the experiment. = 他们在实验之前就已经知道了外显率。
Scientists had found that the penetrance varied among individuals. = 科学家发现外显率在个体之间有所不同。


将来时:
Future studies will analyze the penetrance of this gene further. = 未来的研究将进一步分析该基因的外显率。
We will determine the penetrance using a larger sample size. = 我们将使用更大的样本量来确定外显率。


虚拟语气:
If the penetrance were higher, more individuals would be affected. = 如果外显率更高，受影响的个体就会更多。
I wish we knew the exact penetrance of this condition. = 我希望我们知道这种疾病的确切外显率。


被动语态:
The penetrance was calculated using statistical methods. = 外显率是使用统计方法计算的。
The penetrance is being investigated by several research teams. = 外显率正在被几个研究小组调查。


疑问句:
What is the penetrance of this genetic disorder? = 这种遗传疾病的外显率是多少？
How is the penetrance affected by environmental factors? = 环境因素如何影响外显率？


否定句:
The penetrance is not always complete. = 外显率并非总是完全的。
This gene does not show complete penetrance. = 该基因不显示完全外显率。


PHRASE->
reduced penetrance = 降低的外显率
incomplete penetrance = 不完全外显率
age-dependent penetrance = 年龄依赖性外显率
variable penetrance = 可变外显率
high penetrance = 高外显率
