词源:

The word "misprision" comes from Anglo-French *mesprisun*, which itself derives from the Old French *mespris*, meaning "contempt," "disregard," or "neglect."  The prefix "mis-" adds a sense of wrongdoing or error to the root meaning.


用法说明:

Misprision is primarily a legal term, particularly in common law jurisdictions.  It doesn't refer to a simple oversight or mistake, but rather to a deliberate act of ignoring or concealing knowledge of a crime.  The specific legal implications of misprision vary depending on the jurisdiction and the specifics of the case, but generally involve a failure to report a known crime.  The severity of the offense often depends on the seriousness of the crime concealed and the level of involvement in the concealment.
