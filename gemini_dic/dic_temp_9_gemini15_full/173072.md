词源:
The word "quartermaster" comes from the Middle English "quartourmaistre,"  itself derived from Old French "quartour maistre."  "Quartour" refers to a quarter or a fourth, originally relating to the division of troops, and "maistre" means master.  Thus, a quartermaster was originally a master or officer responsible for a quarter (a section) of the troops' supplies and logistics.
