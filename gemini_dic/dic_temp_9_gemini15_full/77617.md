The word "geffer" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown cannot be provided.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, the surrounding sentence, etc.), it might be possible to determine the intended word.
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word, a regional slang term, or jargon specific to a particular community or field.  Again, context is crucial.
* **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a person's name or a place name.

Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  Please clarify the word or provide additional context.
