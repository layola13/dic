词源:

The word "longevous" originates from the Latin word "longaevus," which is a combination of "longus" (long) and "aevum" (age, lifetime).


用法说明:

Longevous is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that is long-lasting or has a long lifespan.  It's often used to describe living organisms (plants, animals, and people) but can also apply to inanimate objects or concepts that have endured for a considerable time.  The word carries a sense of impressive duration or longevity.  It's less common in everyday conversation than synonyms like "long-lived," but it's frequently found in formal writing, especially in scientific or historical contexts.

例句:

1.  The study showed a correlation between healthy diet and a longevous life. 这项研究表明健康饮食与长寿之间存在关联。
