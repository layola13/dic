The word "jewstone" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established meaning, etymology, or usage.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a term from a very niche or obscure context.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.
