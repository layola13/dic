proofest:/pruːfɪst/| adj.|最能证明的，最确凿的|The proofest evidence was the eyewitness testimony. |近义词：strongest, most conclusive|反义词：weakest, most dubious|


This word is not a standard English word.  It is likely a nonce word, meaning it's coined for a specific occasion and not found in standard dictionaries. It's formed by adding the superlative suffix "-est" to "proof," intending to create a superlative form meaning "most proof" or "most conclusively proving."  However, the standard way to express this would be "most conclusive proof" or "strongest evidence".

There is no established etymology, usage, or grammatical information for "proofest" because it's not a real word.  Therefore, sections like USAGE, PHRASE, etc., cannot be provided.  The only information available is its likely intended meaning and its non-standard nature.
