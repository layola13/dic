词源:
The word "meteoroidal" is derived from "meteoroid," which in turn comes from "meteor" + "-oid," a suffix indicating resemblance.  "Meteor" itself has Greek origins, ultimately stemming from the Greek word "meteōros," meaning "high in the air," "lifted up," or "suspended."  The "-oid" suffix implies a likeness or resemblance, hence a meteoroid is something resembling a meteor.
