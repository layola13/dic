premidsummers:/ˌpriːˈmɪdˌsʌmərz/| adj.|仲夏之前的|This word appears to be a neologism or a very rare, obscure word not found in standard dictionaries.  It seems to be a combination of "pre-" (before), "midsummer" (the middle of summer), and a plural "-s".  It likely describes a time period shortly before midsummer.  Therefore, a precise definition and usage examples cannot be provided without more context.  The word's meaning would depend entirely on the author's intended usage.|  例句： (由于词典中未收录，无法提供例句)|近义词:early summer, late spring|反义词:late summer, autumn
