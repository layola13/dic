词源:
From "neuro-" (nerve) + "-logic" (relating to, pertaining to).  "Neuro-" is derived from the Greek word "νεῦρον" (neuron), meaning "nerve". "-logic" comes from the Greek word "λογικός" (logikos), meaning "logical," "relating to," or "pertaining to."  Therefore, "neurologic" literally means "relating to the nerves."
