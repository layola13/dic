/pænˈzoʊɪzəm/ | n. |泛神论|Panzoism is a philosophical concept asserting that all of reality is God or that God is everything.  It's a form of pantheism, emphasizing the immanence of God in the world, rather than a transcendence separate from it.  It differs from pantheism in that it doesn't necessarily posit a personal God.  Different interpretations exist, some closer to idealism, others to materialism.|The ancient Stoics held a view that could be considered a form of panzoism, believing that the divine logos permeated all of existence.|近义词：pantheism, panentheism|反义词：atheism, deism
