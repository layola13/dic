词源:
The word "racehorse" is a compound word, combining "race" and "horse".  "Race," in this context, derives from Old French *race, meaning "course, running," ultimately from the Latin *currere, "to run." "Horse" comes from Old English *hors, related to other Germanic words for horse.  Therefore, a racehorse is literally a horse used in a race.
