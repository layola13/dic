isodimorphism:/ˌaɪsoʊdaɪˈmɔːrfɪzəm/| n. |同晶形现象|The phenomenon where two different chemical substances crystallize in the same crystalline system and have similar angles between corresponding crystal faces.|  The minerals calcite and aragonite are an example of isodimorphism.  Calcite and aragonite both have the same chemical formula (CaCO3), but calcite crystallizes in the trigonal system while aragonite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system.  However, both can form crystals with similar angles, demonstrating isodimorphism.|近义词：polymorphism|反义词：monomorphism|
