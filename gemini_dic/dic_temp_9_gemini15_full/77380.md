词源:
The word "gauntletted" derives from the noun "gauntlet," which originally referred to a long, heavy glove worn by knights in battle.  The phrase "to run the gauntlet" emerged from the military practice of having a soldier forced to run between two lines of soldiers who struck him as he passed.  This evolved into a figurative meaning of facing a difficult or dangerous ordeal.  Therefore, "gauntletted" describes someone who has undergone such an ordeal.
