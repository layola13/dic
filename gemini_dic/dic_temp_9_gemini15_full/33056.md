词源:

The word "chow chow" has a somewhat uncertain etymology.  The term's use for a Chinese mixed dish and the dog breed likely stems from a similar origin. One theory suggests it is an onomatopoeic word possibly derived from the sound of the dog's bark. Another theory suggests it's a corrupted form of the Cantonese term for "things" or "bits and pieces," reflecting the mixed nature of the dish.  Its use in referring to Chinese food in general might also be associated with the British colonial era and their exposure to diverse Chinese cuisine.
