phototaxis:/ˌfoʊtoʊˈtæksɪs/| n. |趋光性|The movement of an organism toward or away from a source of light.  Phototaxis is a type of taxis, a movement in response to a stimulus. Positive phototaxis is movement towards light, while negative phototaxis is movement away from light.|Example: Many plants exhibit positive phototaxis, turning their leaves towards the sun to maximize photosynthesis.  许多植物表现出正向趋光性，将叶子转向太阳以最大限度地进行光合作用。|近义词: phototropism (although phototropism specifically refers to plant growth)|反义词: negative phototaxis (for positive phototaxis); skototropism (movement away from light)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The plant exhibits positive phototaxis. = 植物表现出正向趋光性。
Euglena shows phototaxis towards sunlight. = 眼虫表现出趋向阳光的趋光性。


一般过去时:
The amoeba displayed negative phototaxis. = 阿米巴原虫表现出负趋光性。
The experiment demonstrated clear phototaxis in the bacteria. = 实验表明细菌具有明显的趋光性。


现在完成时:
Scientists have observed phototaxis in various organisms. = 科学家们已经在各种生物体中观察到趋光性。
Researchers have documented the complex mechanisms of phototaxis. = 研究人员已经记录了趋光性的复杂机制。


过去完成时:
Before the light was turned on, the organisms had shown no phototaxis. = 在灯打开之前，这些生物体没有表现出趋光性。
The researchers had hypothesized that the phototaxis was linked to a specific protein. = 研究人员假设趋光性与一种特定的蛋白质有关。


将来时:
We will study phototaxis in different light conditions. = 我们将在不同的光照条件下研究趋光性。
The researchers will investigate the genetic basis of phototaxis. = 研究人员将研究趋光性的遗传基础。


虚拟语气:
If the light intensity were higher, the organisms would exhibit stronger phototaxis. = 如果光强度更高，生物体将表现出更强的趋光性。
It is hypothesized that if the receptor was damaged, phototaxis would be impaired. = 假设如果受体受损，趋光性就会受损。


被动语态:
Phototaxis was observed in the experiment. = 在实验中观察到趋光性。
The mechanism of phototaxis is being investigated. = 正在研究趋光性的机制。


疑问句:
Does this organism exhibit phototaxis? = 这种生物体是否表现出趋光性？
What factors influence the phototaxis of this species? = 哪些因素会影响该物种的趋光性？


否定句:
The organism did not show any phototaxis. = 该生物体没有表现出任何趋光性。
This species does not exhibit positive phototaxis. = 这个物种不表现出正向趋光性。


PHRASE->
positive phototaxis  正向趋光性
negative phototaxis  负向趋光性
phototactic response 趋光性反应
mechanism of phototaxis 趋光性机制
bacterial phototaxis  细菌趋光性
