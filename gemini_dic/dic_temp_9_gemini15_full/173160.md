quasi-aside:/ˈkwɑːzaɪ əˈsaɪd/| adj.|似旁白；似离题；近似旁白|A quasi-aside is a remark made by a character in a play that is meant to be heard by the audience but not by the other characters on stage.  It's a kind of comment that falls somewhere between a full aside (completely unheard by other characters) and a direct address to the audience.  The speaker may turn slightly to the audience or use a tone of voice to signal this partial aside. |例句：He gave a quasi-aside to the audience, muttering about the absurdity of the situation. 他对观众做了一个近似旁白的评论，低声抱怨情况的荒谬。

例句：The actress delivered a quasi-aside, her eyes flicking toward the audience, before resuming the scene. 女演员在恢复剧情之前，对观众做了一个似旁白的评论，眼睛扫向观众。
