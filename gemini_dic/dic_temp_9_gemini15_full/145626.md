/ˌoʊvərˈkɑːnstəntnəs/ | n. | 过度恒定；过分不变；墨守成规 |  The word "overconstantness" is not a standard English word.  It's a neologism, meaning a newly coined word or expression. It combines "over-" (meaning excessively) with "constantness" (the state of being constant).  Therefore, it suggests an excessive or unhealthy degree of consistency, unchangingness, or adherence to routine.  The implied meaning is negative, suggesting rigidity and a lack of adaptability.  There are no standard dictionaries listing this word, so examples and synonyms/antonyms are based on the implied meaning. | Example: His overconstantness in his work habits prevented him from adapting to new challenges. 他工作习惯的过度不变阻碍了他适应新的挑战。 | 近义词: inflexibility, rigidity, immutability,  stubbornness,  dogmatism | 反义词: adaptability, flexibility,  versatility,  open-mindedness,  innovation |  n.
