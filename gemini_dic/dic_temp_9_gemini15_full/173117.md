词源：

用法说明:

`quasi-active` is primarily used in scientific and technical contexts, particularly in fields like chemistry, biology, and engineering. It describes something that shows some signs of activity but doesn't fully meet the criteria for being considered truly active.  The "quasi-" prefix softens the meaning of "active," indicating an incomplete or partial state.  It suggests a resemblance to activity without being fully active.  There's an element of ambiguity or uncertainty involved.

The word doesn't have common usage in everyday conversational English.  It's a more specialized term.
