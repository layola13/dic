词源:

The word "epicurean" is derived from the name of the ancient Greek philosopher Epicurus (341-270 BC). Epicurus founded a school of philosophy that emphasized pleasure as the highest good, but not in a crude, sensual way.  His philosophy focused on attaining a state of tranquility (ataraxia) and freedom from fear (aponia), which he believed could be achieved through moderation and intellectual pursuits, alongside simple pleasures.  The modern understanding of "epicurean" often focuses on the refined aspects of his philosophy, leading to the association with gourmet food and luxurious living.
