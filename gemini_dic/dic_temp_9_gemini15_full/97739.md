initialisms:/ɪˈnɪʃəlɪzəm/ | n. |首字母缩略词|An initialism is an abbreviation formed from the initial letters of a name or phrase, each letter being pronounced separately.  Unlike acronyms, initialisms are not pronounced as a word. For example, "FBI" (Federal Bureau of Investigation) is an initialism because it's pronounced "F-B-I," not as a single word.  |例句：The abbreviation "USA" is an initialism, as it's pronounced "U-S-A" rather than as a single word. 美国缩写“USA”是一个首字母缩略词，因为它的发音是“U-S-A”，而不是一个词。|近义词：abbreviation, acronym (though technically different)|反义词：full form, complete name|
