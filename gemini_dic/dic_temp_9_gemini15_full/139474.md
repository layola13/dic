词源:

Obstinately derives from the Old French word "obstiné,"  meaning "obstinate, stubborn."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "obstinatus," the past participle of "obstinare," meaning "to be stubborn, to persist."  The prefix "ob-" means "against" or "in the way of," and "stinare" is related to the Latin word "stare," meaning "to stand."  Therefore, the word's root suggests "standing against" or "persisting against."
