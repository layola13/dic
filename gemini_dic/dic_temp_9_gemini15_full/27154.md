词源:
The verb "call on" originates from the Old English word "ceapian", which means "to trade" or "to bargain".  Over time, the meaning evolved to include the sense of visiting someone for a purpose, often a business transaction.  The current meaning encompasses a broader range of actions, from social visits to formal requests.
