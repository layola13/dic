PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "hydropathical".  Its use is primarily in scientific and technical contexts.  Phrases would be descriptive: "highly hydropathical surface", "hydropathical polymer", "hydropathical interaction",  "relatively hydropathical", "inherently hydropathical"


词源:
The word "hydropathical" is derived from the Greek words:

* **hydro-**:  meaning "water"
* **-pathic**: from Greek *pathētikos*, meaning "suffering" or "affected by,"  in this context, implying a resistance to or aversion to water.

Thus, "hydropathical" literally means "water-affected" in a negative sense, indicating a repulsion of water.  Note that this is distinct from "hydrophobic", which is more commonly used and is also derived from Greek, but with "phobos" meaning "fear" instead of *pathētikos*.  Both terms, however, describe the same property.
