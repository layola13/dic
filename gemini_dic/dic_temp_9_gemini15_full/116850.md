词源:

The word "maximising" is derived from the verb "maximize," which itself comes from the noun "maximum."  "Maximum" originates from the Latin word "maximus," meaning "greatest" or "largest."  The suffix "-ize" is a common verb-forming suffix in English, indicating to make something into a certain state.  Therefore, "maximize" means "to make something as great as possible," and "maximising" is its present participle form, indicating an ongoing action.
