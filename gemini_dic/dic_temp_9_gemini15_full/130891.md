/nɒnˈærəɡənsɪz/ | n. | 非傲慢；谦逊 (复数) | The word "nonarrogances" is not a standard English word.  It's a neologism, likely formed by adding the prefix "non-" to "arrogances" (the plural of arrogance).  It attempts to describe the opposite of arrogance,  meaning instances or qualities of humility, modesty, or lack of arrogance. However, it's not commonly used or accepted in standard English dictionaries. A better way to express this would be to use words like "humility," "modesty," or "unassuming behavior."  | Example:  Instead of saying "His nonarrogances were evident," one would say "His humility was evident," or "He showed great modesty." | 近义词: humilities, modest acts, unassuming behaviors | 反义词: arrogances, acts of pride, boastfulness | 名词
