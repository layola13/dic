词源:
irreproachable (adj.) + -ness (suffix forming nouns of state or quality)

irreproachable derives from:

* **reproach** (v.) : to express disapproval or criticism of someone.  Origin: from Old French *reprochier*, from Latin *reprobare* "to disapprove, reject."
* **ir-** (prefix):  not, without.  Origin: Old English *ir-,* from Proto-Germanic *-iz.

Therefore, irreproachableness signifies the state of being free from reproach or criticism.
