eukaryotic:/ˌjuːkæriˈɒtɪk/| adj.| 真核的 | Relating to or denoting organisms whose cells contain a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.  Eukaryotic cells are complex and are found in plants, animals, fungi, and protists.  | Example:  Plants are eukaryotic organisms.  植物是真核生物。


The study of eukaryotic cells is crucial to understanding biology. 真核细胞的研究对于理解生物学至关重要。


近义词：nucleated (only if referring specifically to the presence of a nucleus)


反义词：prokaryotic


词性：形容词

USAGE->

否定句:
The bacteria are not eukaryotic; they are prokaryotic. = 细菌不是真核的；它们是原核的。
This cell type does not exhibit eukaryotic features. = 这种细胞类型不表现出真核特征。


PHRASE->
eukaryotic cell = 真核细胞
eukaryotic gene = 真核基因
eukaryotic genome = 真核基因组
eukaryotic protein = 真核蛋白
eukaryotic transcription = 真核转录


词源:
The word "eukaryotic" is derived from the Greek words "eu" (meaning "true," "good," or "well") and "karyon" (meaning "kernel" or "nut," referring to the nucleus).  Thus, "eukaryotic" literally means "having a true nucleus."
