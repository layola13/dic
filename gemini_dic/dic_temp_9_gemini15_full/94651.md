词源:

The word "Impressionist" is derived from the French word "impressionnisme," which itself originated from the title of Claude Monet's painting "Impression, soleil levant" ("Impression, Sunrise").  The term was initially used derisively, but it was quickly adopted by the artists themselves and became synonymous with their revolutionary approach to painting.  The suffix "-ist" indicates a person or thing associated with a particular style or movement.
