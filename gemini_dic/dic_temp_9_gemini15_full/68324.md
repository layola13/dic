词源：The phrasal verb "fall back on" combines the verb "fall" (to drop or descend) with the preposition "back" (to a previous position or state) and the preposition "on" (indicating dependence or reliance).  The sense of retreating to a previous position or resource is key to its meaning.  The origins of the individual words are Old English, with "fall" tracing back to "feallan" and "back" and "on" having related earlier forms.
