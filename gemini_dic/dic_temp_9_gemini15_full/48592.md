词源:
The word "defecating" comes from the Latin word "defecare," meaning "to cleanse," "to purify," or "to purge."  The suffix "-ating" indicates the present participle, signifying an ongoing action.  Over time, the meaning narrowed to specifically refer to the expulsion of waste matter from the bowels.
