The word "konia" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full etymological analysis, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  To do so would be fabricating information.  If you have misspelled the word, or it is from a specific dialect or niche field, please provide more context.
