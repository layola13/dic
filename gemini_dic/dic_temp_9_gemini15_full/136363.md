WORD ORIGIN->

* **non-:**  Prefix meaning "not."
* **respectable:** Adjective meaning "worthy of respect; reputable; decent."  This comes from the Old French *respectable*, ultimately from Latin *respectābilis* ("deserving of respect"), from *respectus* ("regard, respect").
* **-ness:** Suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a quality or state.

Therefore, "nonrespectablenesses" literally means "the states or qualities of not being respectable,"  a rather cumbersome and rarely used word.
