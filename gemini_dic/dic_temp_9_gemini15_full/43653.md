词源:
The word "creature" comes from the Old French word "creature," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "creatura," meaning "a thing created."  The Latin word is a derivative of "creare," meaning "to create."  Therefore, the word's etymology reflects its core meaning: something that has been created or brought into existence.
