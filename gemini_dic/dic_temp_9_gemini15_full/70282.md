词源:
The word "fiddly" likely originates from the word "fiddle," meaning to manipulate something clumsily or with difficulty.  The -ly suffix transforms the verb into an adjective describing something with a similar quality.  The connection lies in the small, precise movements often associated with both fiddling and working with delicate, intricate objects.
