词源:  The word "skint" is of uncertain origin, but is likely a slang term.  The most plausible theory connects it to the Old English word "scin" meaning "to shine" or "to glitter," which may refer to the shiny surface of worn-out leather or fabrics.  Another, less likely, etymology suggests a connection to the word "skin" referring to someone being "skinned" of their money.  Its slang nature makes definitive tracing difficult.


用法说明:

"Skint" is primarily used informally in British English and some other dialects of English. It's rarely used in formal writing or speech.  It is primarily used to describe a lack of money but can also describe something worn out or damaged.
