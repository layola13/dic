prealgebras:/ˌpriːˈælɡɪbrəz/| n. |预代数；前代数|A prealgebra is a structure that satisfies most, but not all, of the axioms of an algebra.  It's often a stepping stone towards a full algebra, lacking certain properties like associativity or a multiplicative identity.  For example, a non-associative algebra is a prealgebra.  The specific axioms that a prealgebra needs to satisfy can vary depending on the context.  They are frequently encountered in abstract algebra and related fields.| Example:  The study of prealgebras provides a framework for understanding the properties that lead to a full algebra.  |近义词: proto-algebra, near-algebra |反义词: algebra


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The prealgebra satisfies the distributive law. = 这个预代数满足分配律。
This prealgebra lacks a multiplicative identity. = 这个预代数缺乏乘法单位元。


一般过去时:
The mathematician studied various prealgebras. = 这位数学家研究了各种预代数。
We examined the properties of a specific prealgebra. = 我们检查了特定预代数的性质。


现在完成时:
Researchers have developed new methods for analyzing prealgebras. = 研究人员已经开发出分析预代数的新方法。
They have found interesting connections between prealgebras and other structures. = 他们发现了预代数和其他结构之间有趣的联系。


过去完成时:
Before the theorem was proven, we had explored several types of prealgebras. = 在定理被证明之前，我们已经探索了几种类型的预代数。
They had already investigated the properties of this prealgebra before publishing their results. = 在发表他们的结果之前，他们已经研究了这个预代数的性质。


将来时:
We will investigate the applications of prealgebras in physics. = 我们将研究预代数在物理学中的应用。
Scientists will use prealgebras to model complex systems. = 科学家们将用预代数来模拟复杂的系统。


虚拟语气:
If this were a full algebra, it would have a multiplicative identity. = 如果这是一个完整的代数，它将有一个乘法单位元。
I wish I understood the intricacies of prealgebras better. = 我希望我能更好地理解预代数的复杂性。


被动语态:

疑问句:
What are the defining characteristics of a prealgebra? = 预代数的定义特征是什么？
What applications do prealgebras have in computer science? = 预代数在计算机科学中有哪些应用？


否定句:
This structure is not a prealgebra because it doesn't satisfy the distributive law. = 这个结构不是预代数，因为它不满足分配律。
This particular example does not represent a typical prealgebra. = 这个具体的例子并不代表典型的预代数。


PHRASE->
prealgebra structure = 预代数结构
types of prealgebras = 预代数类型
properties of prealgebras = 预代数的性质
