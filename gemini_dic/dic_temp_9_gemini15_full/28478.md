The word "carcavelhos" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a word from a specific dialect, possibly Portuguese.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and usage examples in English are impossible without more context.  To provide the requested information, I need the language of origin and any additional context surrounding the word's use.
