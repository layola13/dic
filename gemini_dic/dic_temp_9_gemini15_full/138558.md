/ɛnpiːjuː/| n.|神经处理单元|Neural Processing Unit.  A type of hardware accelerator used for machine learning and artificial intelligence. It is designed to perform specific mathematical operations efficiently, often involving matrix multiplications and convolutions, which are common in deep learning algorithms.  NPU's are often found in mobile devices, embedded systems, and edge computing devices to handle AI tasks locally.|Example:  My phone uses an NPU to process images for facial recognition. 我的手机使用神经处理单元来处理面部识别的图像。|近义词：AI accelerator, neural network accelerator|反义词：CPU (for general purpose computing)
