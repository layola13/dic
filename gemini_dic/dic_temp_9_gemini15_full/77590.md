The word "geed" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.  There's no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of another word.  More context is needed to guess the intended word.
* **A slang term:** It might be a very informal, regional, or niche slang word not widely known.
* **A proper noun:** It could be a name or place name.
* **A neologism:**  A newly coined word not yet accepted into common usage.


To provide the requested analysis, I need more information about where you encountered this word and the context in which it was used.
