The word "scole" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., following the requested format.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps a misspelling of "school," "scoff," or another word entirely?  Please double-check the spelling.
* **It's a dialect word or archaic word:** It might be a word used in a specific region or a very old word no longer in common use.
* **It's a neologism or invented word:** It could be a newly coined word, a technical term, or a word invented for a specific purpose.

If you can provide more context where you encountered this word (e.g., the sentence it was used in, the source text), I might be able to offer a better guess as to its meaning or possible origin.
