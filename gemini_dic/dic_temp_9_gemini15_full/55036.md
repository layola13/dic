词源:
The word "disquietful" is derived from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of"), "quiet" (meaning "peaceful" or "calm"), and the suffix "-ful" (meaning "full of").  Therefore, it literally means "full of not being quiet," or "full of unrest."  The word's evolution reflects a shift in meaning from simply lacking quiet to actively possessing a state of anxiety or unease.
