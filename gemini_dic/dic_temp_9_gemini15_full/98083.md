词源:
The word "inquisition" comes from the Old French word "enqueste," meaning "inquiry" or "investigation."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "inquisitio," meaning "a searching into,"  "an inquiry," or "investigation."  The Latin word is formed from the verb "inquirere," meaning "to seek out" or "to inquire."  The modern English usage reflects both the historical meaning of the Roman Catholic tribunal and the broader sense of thorough investigation.
