This word does not exist in standard English.  There is no word "outequivocate".  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  To help you, I can offer analysis of the potential components:

* **Out-:** This prefix often means "to a greater extent" or "completely".  For example, "outperform" means to perform better than others.

* **Equivocate:**  /ɪˈkwɪvəkeɪt/ | v. | 含糊其辞；支吾其词 | To use ambiguous language so as to conceal the truth or avoid committing oneself. |  He equivocated when asked about his involvement in the scandal. 他被问及卷入丑闻时支吾其辞。| 近义词：prevaricate, hedge, obfuscate | 反义词：clarify, state clearly


If you meant a word combining these elements, we'd need to understand the intended meaning.  Perhaps you were thinking of a word like "unequivocally" (clearly, without doubt) or a phrase using "equivocate" in a negative or emphatic context (e.g., "to absolutely not equivocate").

Please provide more context or clarify the word you intended to use, and I'll be happy to provide a full analysis according to the requested format.
