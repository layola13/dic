poecilopoda:/ˌsiːsɪˈlɒpədə/| n. |多足纲动物|Poecilopoda is a subclass of crustaceans characterized by their diverse and often bizarre body forms and appendages. They are predominantly marine organisms, known for their unusual adaptations to various lifestyles and environments. Many poecilopods are parasitic, exhibiting significant morphological modifications associated with their parasitic existence.| Example:  The study of poecilopod evolution has revealed fascinating insights into the adaptive radiation of crustaceans.  多足纲动物进化研究揭示了甲壳类动物适应性辐射的迷人见解。|近义词: crustacean (更广义)|反义词: N/A
