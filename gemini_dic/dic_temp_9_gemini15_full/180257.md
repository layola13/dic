词源:
The word "refrainer" derives from the verb "refrain," meaning to abstain from doing something. "Refrain" itself comes from the Old French "refrener," meaning "to bridle, restrain," ultimately from the Latin "refrēnāre," a compound of "re-" (again, back) and "frēnāre" (to bridle).  The "-er" suffix added to "refrain" creates the noun form indicating a person who performs the action.
