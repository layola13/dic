metallochrome:/ˈmɛtəlˌoʊkroʊm/| n. |金属显色剂|A metallochrome is a type of dye or indicator that forms a colored complex with a metal ion. These complexes are often used in analytical chemistry to detect and quantify metal ions in solution.  Metallochromic indicators change color upon binding to a specific metal ion, allowing for visual detection of the metal's presence.  The color change is due to a change in the electronic structure of the dye molecule upon complexation with the metal ion.|Example: EDTA is often used as a metallochrome indicator in chelation titrations.|近义词：metal indicator, chelating agent|反义词：无
