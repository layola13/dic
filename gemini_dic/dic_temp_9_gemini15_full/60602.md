The word provided "{elcaja}" is not a word in standard English.  It seems to be a misspelling or a word from another language.  It is likely a misspelling of "el caj√≥n" (Spanish) which means "the drawer" or "the box".  Therefore, I cannot provide a complete analysis as requested in the format.  To provide a proper analysis, please provide a valid English word.
