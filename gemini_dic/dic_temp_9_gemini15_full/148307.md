词源:
The word "oversolicitous" is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the adjective "solicitous," which comes from the Latin word "solicitus," meaning "anxious," "concerned," or "careful."  Therefore, "oversolicitous" literally means "excessively anxious" or "excessively concerned."
