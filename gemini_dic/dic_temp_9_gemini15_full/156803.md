词源:
The word "pigeonhole" originates from the physical compartments used to house pigeons. The figurative use, referring to classifying or categorizing, emerged later.  The "hole" part refers to the small compartment in a pigeon coop, while "pigeon" refers to the bird itself. The combination evolved to represent the act of placing something into a specific category.
