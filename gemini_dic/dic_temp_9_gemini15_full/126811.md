The term "napalm" is a portmanteau of the names of its original components:  **NA**phthenic acid and **palm**itic acid.  These fatty acids were used as gelling agents in early napalm formulations.  The specific composition has varied over time, but the core principle remains the same: a gasoline-based substance thickened to adhere to its target and burn fiercely.
