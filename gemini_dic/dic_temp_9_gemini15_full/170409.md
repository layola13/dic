prowessful: /ˈpraʊəsfʊl/ | adj. | 技艺精湛的；熟练的 |  This word is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word.  It's formed by adding the suffix "-ful" (meaning "full of") to "prowess," which means exceptional skill or ability.  Therefore, "prowessful" logically should mean "full of prowess,"  but it lacks established usage and recognition in standard dictionaries.  Because of its non-standard nature, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage in the same way as for established words is not possible.


英文解析:  While grammatically understandable, the word lacks common usage.  It attempts to convey the idea of possessing a high degree of skill or expertise.


例句: (Hypothetical, illustrating intended meaning)


The prowessful blacksmith crafted a magnificent sword. = 技艺精湛的铁匠打造了一把华丽的剑。


近义词:  There isn't a direct synonym, but words like skillful, adept, expert, masterful, proficient convey similar meanings.
