resonators:/ˈrezənˌeɪtərz/| n. |谐振器，共振器 |A resonator is a device or system that enhances or amplifies a specific frequency or range of frequencies.  It works by storing and releasing energy at its resonant frequency.  Resonators are used in a wide variety of applications, from musical instruments to electronic circuits. |例句：The guitar's soundboard acts as a resonator, amplifying the vibrations of the strings. 吉他面板充当谐振器，放大琴弦的振动。

The Helmholtz resonator in the car's exhaust system reduces noise pollution. 汽车排气系统中的亥姆霍兹谐振器降低了噪音污染。|近义词：vibrator, amplifier |反义词：dampener, absorber
