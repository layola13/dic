compactification:/ˌkɒmpæktɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/ | n. |紧致化；压实；小型化 |The process of making something more compact or smaller, often by reducing the number of dimensions. This term is frequently used in physics, particularly in string theory, to describe the process where extra spatial dimensions are curled up or compactified into a small, unobservable size.  |Example:  The compactification of the extra dimensions is a crucial aspect of string theory.  紧致化额外维度是弦理论的一个关键方面。

The compactification of the data reduced storage space. 数据的紧致化减少了存储空间。|近义词：miniaturization, reduction, condensation |反义词：expansion, enlargement

词源:

The word "compactification" is derived from the word "compact," meaning to press together or make more dense, combined with the suffix "-ification," which indicates the process or result of making something.  The root word "compact" traces back to the Latin word "compactus," a past participle of "compingere," meaning "to press together."
