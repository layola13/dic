/ˌoʊvəræbˈsteɪnd/ | adj. | 过度弃权的，过度抑制的 |  The term "overabstained" is not a standard dictionary word. It's a neologism, likely formed by combining "over-" (meaning excessively) and "abstained" (meaning to refrain from something, often voting).  It implies a situation where abstention has gone beyond a reasonable or expected level.  It could describe a situation where an unusually large number of people have abstained from voting, or where someone has refrained from something to an excessive degree. |  例句：The unusually high number of overabstained votes suggested widespread apathy towards the issue.  过度弃权的选票数量异常之高，表明人们对这个问题普遍漠不关心。


近义词： excessively restrained, overly inhibited, unduly reserved | 反义词： overly involved, highly participatory
