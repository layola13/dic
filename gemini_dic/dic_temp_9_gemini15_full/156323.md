/ˈfɪzɪkəlniːsɪz/ | n. | 物质性；物质存在；肉体性 | The word "physicalness's" is not a standard English word.  It seems to be an attempt to make "physicalness" possessive, which is grammatically incorrect. "Physicalness" itself refers to the quality or state of being physical. It denotes the tangible, material aspects of something, often contrasting with the intangible or spiritual.  To express possession, one would use "physicalness's" only in rare, informal and unconventional contexts,  and even then it's considered poor grammar.  A more acceptable way to express possession would be "the physicalness of something".| The sculpture's physicalness was striking.  这尊雕塑的物质性令人印象深刻。|  materiality, corporeality, tangibility | intangibility, spirituality | n.
