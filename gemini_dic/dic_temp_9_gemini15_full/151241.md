词源:

* **parent:** From Old French *parent*, from Latin *parens, parentis* ("father, mother, protector").  The Latin word is related to *pario, parere* ("to produce, bring forth").  This reflects the biological role of parents in producing offspring.


用法说明:

"Parent's" is a possessive noun, meaning it shows possession or belonging.  It's grammatically equivalent to "parents'," although "parents'" is more common in formal writing when referring to multiple parents' possessions. "Parent's" can refer to either one parent or both parents depending on the context. It is almost exclusively used as an attributive adjective. It is rarely used as a noun.

Note: There is no verb, adjective, or adverb form of "parent's".  The related adjectives are "parental" (relating to parents) and "filial" (relating to a child's relationship with parents).
