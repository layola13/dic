英文解析：
1.  **As a proper noun:**  Refers to the title of Mary Shelley's famous 1818 novel, *Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus*.  The novel is about Victor Frankenstein, a scientist who creates a creature from various body parts and brings it to life.  The term is often used to refer to the novel itself or to the themes it explores (e.g., ambition, the dangers of unchecked scientific advancement, the nature of humanity).

2.  **As a common noun:**  Often used to refer to the creature created by Victor Frankenstein, although this is technically incorrect. The creature in the novel is never actually named. The term "Frankenstein" is often mistakenly used as a synonym for "monster."

3.  **Figurative use:** It is used more broadly to describe anything artificially created or assembled from disparate parts, often with unforeseen and disastrous consequences.  This can apply to various technological advancements or projects that go wrong.
