USAGE->
This word is archaic and rarely used in modern English, so providing examples across all verb tenses and grammatical structures is not practical.  The word itself is a noun, not a verb, adjective, or other word class that would allow for such grammatical conjugations.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "earldorman".  The word is too obsolete for common phrasal usage.
