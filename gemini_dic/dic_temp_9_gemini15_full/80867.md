The word "goutily" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  To provide a helpful response, I need more context where you encountered this word.  For example, providing the sentence it appeared in would be extremely beneficial.
