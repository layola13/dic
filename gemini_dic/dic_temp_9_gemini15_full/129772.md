词源：
The word "non-fallacious" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "fallacious" (meaning "containing a fallacy" or "based on a mistaken belief").  "Fallacious" itself comes from the Latin word "fallacia," meaning "deception" or "trickery".  Therefore, "non-fallacious" literally means "not deceptive" or "not based on a mistaken belief" in the context of logic and reasoning.
