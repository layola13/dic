词源:
The word "opposable" derives from the verb "oppose," meaning "to place opposite" or "to be against."  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or suitability.  Its roots trace back to the Latin word "opponere," a compound of "ob" (against) and "ponere" (to put or place).

用法说明:

The adjective "opposable" is primarily used in the context of anatomy and biology, most commonly to describe the thumb's unique ability to be positioned against the other fingers. This characteristic is crucial for fine motor skills and dexterity.  While it can be used more broadly to describe anything capable of being placed opposite something else, this usage is less common.
