polytopic:/pɒliˈtɒpɪk/| adj.|多位的；多方面的；多主题的 |Relating to or having many places or topics.  The term is often used in scientific contexts, particularly in fields like biochemistry and structural biology,  to describe molecules or structures that occupy multiple locations or possess multiple thematic elements. |例句：The polytopic membrane protein spans the lipid bilayer multiple times.  这个多位膜蛋白多次跨越脂质双层。

The research paper explores several polytopic themes related to climate change. 这篇研究论文探讨了与气候变化相关的几个多主题。|近义词：multifaceted, multi-layered, multi-themed |反义词：monotropic, single-topic
