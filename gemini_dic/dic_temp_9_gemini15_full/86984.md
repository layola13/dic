henhussy: /ˈhɛnhʌsi/ | n. | 泼妇，悍妇 | A henhussy is a derogatory term for a woman who is considered bossy, nagging, or generally unpleasant.  The term is archaic and rarely used in modern English. It combines "hen" (a female chicken, often associated with fussiness) and "hussy" (a derogatory term for a woman, often implying promiscuity or slovenliness).  The combination suggests a woman who is both annoyingly fussy and morally questionable. |  She was called a henhussy by the neighbours for constantly complaining. = 她因为不断抱怨而被邻居称为泼妇。  The old woman, though a henhussy, had a kind heart. = 尽管那个老妇人是个泼妇，但她有一颗善良的心。|  shrew, virago, termagant |  gentlewoman, lady |  名词
