词源:
The term "malapropism" is derived from the name Mrs. Malaprop, a character in Richard Sheridan's 1775 comedy "The Rivals." Mrs. Malaprop is known for her consistently amusing misuse of words.  The word itself is a combination of "mal" (bad) and "a propos" (to the purpose), highlighting the inappropriateness of her word choices.
