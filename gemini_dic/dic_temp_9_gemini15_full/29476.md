catapetalous: /ˌkætəˈpɛtələs/ | adj. | 合瓣的；花瓣合生的 |

英文解析:  Referring to a flower whose petals are united, at least at the base, forming a tube or cup.  This is in contrast to "diapetalous," where the petals are free and separate.  The term is primarily used in botanical descriptions.

The corolla of this flower is catapetalous, forming a distinct tube.  = 这朵花的花冠是合瓣的，形成一个明显的管状结构。

近义词: gamopetalous (more commonly used synonym)

词源:
