词源:  The word "inactuation" is a relatively rare neologism. It's formed by combining the prefix "in-" (meaning "in" or "into"), the verb "actuate" (meaning "to put into action"), and the suffix "-ion" (forming nouns of action or process).  While not found in standard dictionaries, its meaning is clearly derived from its component parts.
