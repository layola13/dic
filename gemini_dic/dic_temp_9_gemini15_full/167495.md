词源:  The word "preversion" is derived from the Latin prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in front of") and the word "version," which comes from the Latin verb "vertere" (meaning "to turn").  Therefore, the word literally means "a turning before" or "a prior turning," implying a distortion or corruption from an original or proper state. The semantic shift towards sexual perversion is a later development.
