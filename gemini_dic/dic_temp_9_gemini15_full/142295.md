orthocenter:/ˈɔːrθoʊsɛntər/| n. |垂心 |The orthocenter is the point of intersection of the altitudes of a triangle.  It is the point where the three altitudes of a triangle meet.  In an acute triangle, the orthocenter lies inside the triangle. In a right-angled triangle, it lies at the vertex of the right angle. In an obtuse triangle, it lies outside the triangle.|The orthocenter of an equilateral triangle is also its centroid and circumcenter. |近义词:None|反义词:None

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The orthocenter is found by drawing altitudes. = 垂心是通过画垂线找到的。
The orthocenter lies within an acute triangle. = 垂心位于锐角三角形内。


一般过去时:
We calculated the orthocenter of the triangle. = 我们计算了三角形的垂心。
The students found the orthocenter using a ruler and compass. = 学生们用尺规找到了垂心。


现在完成时:
We have determined the orthocenter's coordinates. = 我们已经确定了垂心的坐标。
They have located the orthocenter in their geometry problem. = 他们在几何题中找到了垂心。


过去完成时:
They had already calculated the orthocenter before the presentation. = 他们在演示之前已经计算出垂心了。
I had understood the concept of orthocenter before the lesson. = 在上课之前我已经理解了垂心的概念。


将来时:
We will determine the orthocenter using a computer program. = 我们将使用计算机程序确定垂心。
The students will find the orthocenter in their next geometry assignment. = 学生们将在他们的下一个几何作业中找到垂心。


虚拟语气:
If the triangle were equilateral, the orthocenter would be the centroid. = 如果三角形是等边的，则垂心就是重心。
If we had a right triangle, the orthocenter would be at the right angle. = 如果我们有一个直角三角形，则垂心将位于直角处。


被动语态:
The orthocenter was calculated accurately. = 垂心计算准确。
The orthocenter is often found using geometric software. = 垂心经常使用几何软件来查找。


疑问句:
Where is the orthocenter located in this obtuse triangle? = 在这个钝角三角形中，垂心位于何处？
What are the coordinates of the orthocenter? = 垂心的坐标是什么？


否定句:
The orthocenter is not always inside the triangle. = 垂心并不总是在三角形内。
The students did not correctly identify the orthocenter. = 学生们没有正确识别垂心。


PHRASE->
orthocenter of a triangle = 三角形的垂心
locate the orthocenter = 确定垂心
calculate the orthocenter = 计算垂心
find the orthocenter = 找到垂心
properties of the orthocenter = 垂心的性质
