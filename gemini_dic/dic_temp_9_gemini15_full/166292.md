词源:

The word "prereconciliation" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the noun "reconciliation" (meaning "the action of making one view or belief compatible with another").  Therefore, "prereconciliation" literally means "before reconciliation," referring to the process of preparing for a formal reconciliation.
