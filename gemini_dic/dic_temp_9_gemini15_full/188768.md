词源:  The word "runway" originated in the early days of aviation.  "Run" refers to the act of running or moving swiftly, and "way" refers to a path or road.  Therefore, a "runway" literally means a path for running, in this case, for airplanes to run along during takeoff and landing.  The earliest recorded use of the word in this context dates back to the early 20th century.
