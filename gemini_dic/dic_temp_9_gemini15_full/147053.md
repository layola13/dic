词源:
The word "overleap" is formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "above," "beyond," or "excessively") and the verb "leap" (meaning "to jump").  It thus literally means "to leap over" something.  The word's development reflects a straightforward combination of existing elements within the English language, with no significant borrowing from other languages.
