decandrian: /ˌdɛkænˈdriən/ | adj. | 十雄蕊的 | Having ten stamens.  This term is primarily used in botany to describe flowers with ten stamens.  The word is formed from the combining form "deca-" (ten) and "-andrian" (referring to stamens).


例句：

The flower exhibited decandrian characteristics, boasting ten prominent stamens. = 这朵花展现出十雄蕊的特征，拥有十个突出的雄蕊。

The decandrian species was easily identifiable due to its unique floral structure. = 这种十雄蕊的物种由于其独特的floral结构而易于识别。


近义词：  There isn't a direct synonym, as it's a specific botanical term.  Descriptions like "ten-stamened" could be used.

反义词：  Words describing a different number of stamens, such as "pentandrous" (five stamens), "octandrous" (eight stamens), etc., would be considered antonyms in the context of stamen count.


词源:

* deca- : from Greek "deka," meaning ten.
* -andrian: from Greek "aner," meaning man (referring to the stamen's role in reproduction, a metaphorical association).
