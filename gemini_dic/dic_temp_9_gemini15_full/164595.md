The word "preexcuses" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word, or a misspelling.

If you intended a different word, please provide the correct spelling.  If you meant to create a new word,  I can offer potential interpretations based on the prefix "pre-" and the word "excuses," but it would be speculative.
