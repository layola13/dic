The meaning would depend heavily on the context, but it would likely refer to multiple instances of anointing someone or something again.  For example, it could refer to repeated religious ceremonies involving anointing, or to the repeated appointments of someone to a position. Because it is not a standard word, there are no established usages, synonyms, or antonyms.|例句：There is no standard usage example available due to it being a non-standard word.
