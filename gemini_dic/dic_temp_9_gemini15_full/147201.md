It's a relatively rare neologism (newly coined word) formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessive" or "too much") with "magnitudes" (meaning "sizes" or "amounts"). Therefore, it's difficult to provide a detailed etymology or comprehensive usage examples beyond its logical construction.
