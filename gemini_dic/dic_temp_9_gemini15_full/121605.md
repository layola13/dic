词源:

The word "misordination" is a combination of "mis-" (meaning "badly," "wrongly," or "incorrectly") and "ordination" (meaning "arrangement," "order," or "systematic arrangement").  "Ordination" itself comes from the Latin word "ordinatio," meaning "arrangement" or "ordering."  Therefore, "misordination" literally means a "bad" or "incorrect" arrangement or order.
