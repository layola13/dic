词源:

The word "difficulty" comes from the Old French word "difficulté," which itself derives from the Latin word "difficultas."  "Difficultas" is formed from the Latin adjective "difficilis," meaning "hard to do," which is a compound of "dis-" (meaning "not," "apart," or "un-") and "facilis" (meaning "easy"). Therefore, "difficulty" literally means "the state of being not easy."
