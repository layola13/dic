The word "sewen" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a proper noun, a regional dialect word, or a newly coined term not yet widely recognized.  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer a more helpful response.
