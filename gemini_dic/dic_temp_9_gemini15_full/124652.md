Etymology:

The word "mouthpiece" is a compound word formed from "mouth" and "piece."  "Mouth" refers to the opening in the face through which an animal takes in food and emits sounds. "Piece" in this context means a part or component.  Therefore, "mouthpiece" literally means "a piece for the mouth."  Its figurative meaning evolved from the literal meaning of something held in the mouth to represent the voice or opinions of another.
