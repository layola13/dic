词源:
The word "paxywaxy" appears to be a relatively recent coinage, possibly a blend of "paxy" (meaning peaceful or gentle, now largely archaic) and "waxy" (meaning resembling wax in texture or appearance, suggesting softness and yielding).  Its exact etymology requires further linguistic research, and it's not found in standard dictionaries.  It's likely a descriptive term created informally to express a specific nuance of indecisiveness and weakness.
