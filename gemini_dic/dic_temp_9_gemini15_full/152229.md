词源:
From Old French *patrouiller, of uncertain origin, perhaps from a Germanic source akin to Middle High German patroullieren "to wander about," or possibly from a Romance source related to Italian pattugliare "to patrol".  The meaning shifted from "to wander about" to the more specific military and police sense of patrolling.
