privateersman:/ˌpraɪvəˈtɪrzmən/ | n. | 私掠船船员 | A privateersman was a sailor who served on a privately owned ship authorized by a government to attack and capture enemy ships during wartime.  They operated under a letter of marque, which granted them the right to engage in privateering.  Unlike pirates, privateersmen acted under the authority of a nation-state and were expected to adhere to certain rules of war.  However, the line between privateering and piracy could sometimes be blurred. | The privateersman plundered several Spanish galleons before returning to port.  这个私掠船船员掠夺了几艘西班牙大帆船后才返回港口。 | corsair, buccaneer | pirate |
