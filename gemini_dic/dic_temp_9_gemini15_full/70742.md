fine-tuned: /ˈfaɪnˌtjuːnd/ | adj. | 微调的，精细调整的 |  Refers to something that has been adjusted with precision to optimize its performance or function.  It implies a process of making small, incremental changes to achieve a desired outcome. | 例句：The algorithm was fine-tuned to recognize faces more accurately.  该算法经过微调，可以更准确地识别面部。

The model was fine-tuned on a large dataset of images.  该模型在一个大型图像数据集上进行了微调。


近义词：optimized, calibrated, refined, adjusted, perfected | 反义词：crude, rough, unrefined, unadjusted


词源:  Comes from the verb "tune," meaning to adjust something to achieve the best performance, often in the context of musical instruments.  The prefix "fine-" intensifies the meaning, indicating a high degree of precision and meticulousness in the adjustment.  The "-ed" suffix indicates the past participle form, showing that the tuning has already been completed.
