The word "eomis" does not appear to be a word in standard English or any widely recognized dictionary.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you intended a different word.
* **A neologism:** A newly coined word not yet in common usage.
* **A word from a specific field or jargon:** It might be a technical term, slang, or a word from a niche community.
* **A proper noun:**  It could be a name or place name.

If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, the surrounding text, etc.), I may be able to offer a more helpful response.
