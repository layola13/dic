nondenial: /ˌnɒn dɪˈnaɪəl/ | adj. | 不否认的；未被否认的 | Not denying; not disproving.  The nondenial of the rumors only fueled speculation.  | 近义词：uncontradicted, unrefuted | 反义词：denied, refuted | 词性:形容词


英文解析:The word "nondenial" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the noun "denial" (meaning "a statement that something is not true"). Therefore, "nondenial" signifies the absence of denial or a lack of refutation.  It implies that something hasn't been explicitly denied, although it doesn't necessarily mean it's true.  The context is crucial in interpreting its meaning.
