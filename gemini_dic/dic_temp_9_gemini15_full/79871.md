词源:
The word "gnarliness" derives from the adjective "gnarled," which ultimately traces back to the Old English word "cnear," meaning "knot" or "knob."  The "-ness" suffix adds the quality or state of being gnarled.  Therefore, "gnarliness" denotes the state or quality of being full of knots, twists, or complexities.
