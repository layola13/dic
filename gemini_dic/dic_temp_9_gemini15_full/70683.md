词源:
The word "finalising" comes from the verb "finalise," which is a back-formation from the noun "finalisation."  "Finalisation" itself is derived from the adjective "final," ultimately originating from the Latin word "finalis," meaning "belonging to the end."  The "-ise" suffix is a common verb-forming suffix in English, often indicating "to make" or "to become."
