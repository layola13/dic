The word "precommunications" does not exist as a standard English word in dictionaries or common usage.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage examples are impossible to provide.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.

If you meant a different word, or have a specific context in mind where you encountered "precommunications," please provide it so I can offer a more accurate response.  For example, it might be a blend of "pre-communication" which could refer to the planning or preparation stages before communication takes place.  If this is the case, I can explain that concept.
