词源:
The word "slaphead" is a compound word. "Slap" likely refers to the flat, smooth surface of a bald head, suggesting a sudden, forceful impact. "Head" refers to the head itself. The combination suggests the image of a bald head, and the word carries a connotation of harshness and bluntness.  The origin is colloquial and lacks a precise historical record.
