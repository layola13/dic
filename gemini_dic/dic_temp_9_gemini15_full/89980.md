词源:
The word "horsewomanship" is a compound word combining "horse" and "womanship."  "Horse" is of Proto-Germanic origin, referring to the animal. "Womanship" is a less common word, built from "woman" + "-ship,"  "-ship" being a suffix indicating skill, condition, or quality.  Therefore, "horsewomanship" literally describes the skill or expertise of a woman in handling horses.
