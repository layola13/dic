districtly: /ˈdɪstrɪktli/ | adv. |地区地；局部地；严格地 | In a district or districts; locally.  Also, in a strict or definite manner. | 例句：The new law applies districtly to the affected areas. 这项新法律仅适用于受影响地区。

The problem was handled districtly, without wider implications. 这个问题得到了局部处理，没有更广泛的影响。


近义词：locally, regionally, strictly, precisely | 反义词：nationally, globally, loosely, vaguely


词源：源自district (n.) + -ly (adv. suffix).  "District" ultimately comes from the Old French *districte, from Latin districtus, past participle of distinguere "to distinguish, separate," from dis- "apart" + stringere "to draw tight."


用法说明：

"Districtly" has two main senses:

1. **Geographically localized:** This refers to something happening within a specific district or area, and not necessarily extending beyond it.  This usage emphasizes the limited scope.


2. **Strictly or precisely:** This sense implies a precise or strict adherence to rules, regulations, or a specific definition.  It suggests no deviation or ambiguity.


例句：


1. (Geographical): The mayor announced that the new park would be built districtly, meaning it would only benefit residents within the immediate area.  市长宣布新的公园将建在当地，这意味着它只会惠及附近地区的居民。


2. (Strict): The judge instructed the jury to consider the evidence districtly and ignore any extraneous information.  法官指示陪审团严格考虑证据，并忽略任何无关信息。


3. (Geographical):  The campaign focused districtly on the needs of the inner city. 这场运动主要关注市中心的需要。


4. (Strict): The regulations were applied districtly, with no exceptions made. 这些规章制度被严格执行，没有例外。


需要注意的是，“districtly”在现代英语中相对不常用，更常见的表达方式是使用“locally,” “regionally,” “strictly,” or other more precise adverbs depending on the intended meaning.  The word's double meaning can also lead to ambiguity, so careful consideration of context is necessary.
