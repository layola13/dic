The word "millim" does not exist in standard English.  It's possible there's a misspelling or it's a word from a specialized field or a neologism (newly coined word).  I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format because the word lacks a standard definition and usage.  To help me assist you, please double-check the spelling or provide more context about where you encountered this word.
