perturbative: /pərˈtɜːrbətɪv/ | adj. | 微扰的，扰动的 | Relating to or employing perturbation theory, a method of approximation in mathematics and physics that treats a system as slightly disturbed from a simpler system whose solution is known.  It involves calculating corrections to the simpler system's solution to account for the disturbance.  | 例句：The perturbative approach is often used in quantum field theory to calculate scattering amplitudes. = 微扰方法常用于量子场论中计算散射振幅。


The perturbative expansion proved accurate for small deviations from equilibrium. = 微扰展开在远离平衡态的小偏差情况下被证明是准确的。 | 近义词：approximate, approximate, approximate | 反义词：exact, precise

词源:
From perturbative (adjective), from perturb (verb), from Latin perturbare "to disturb, confuse," from per- "through" + turbare "to disturb," from turba "a crowd, tumult."  The -ative suffix indicates an adjective form related to the verb.
