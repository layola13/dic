词源:
The term "hot tub" is a relatively recent combination of "hot" (meaning heated) and "tub" (referring to a container, usually for bathing).  The use of heated water for bathing dates back to ancient times, but the modern concept of a dedicated, often jetted, hot tub is a 20th-century development.  While the exact origins are difficult to pinpoint, the combination of words reflects the simple and descriptive nature of the object.
