USAGE->
一般现在时:
Saponification occurs when fats react with alkali. = 脂肪与碱反应时发生皂化反应。
The process of saponification is widely used in soap manufacturing. = 皂化过程广泛应用于肥皂制造。


一般过去时:
The chemist performed saponification to create a new soap. = 化学家进行了皂化反应以制造一种新的肥皂。

疑问句:
What type of alkali is used in this saponification process? = 在这个皂化过程中使用了哪种碱？
How long does it take for saponification to occur? = 皂化反应需要多长时间？


否定句:
Saponification does not occur without an alkali. = 没有碱就不会发生皂化反应。
The reaction did not proceed to completion due to insufficient alkali. = 由于碱不足，反应未能完全进行。


PHRASE->
saponification reaction = 皂化反应
saponification value = 皂化值
cold saponification = 冷皂化
hot saponification = 热皂化
saponification process = 皂化过程


词源:
The word "saponification" comes from the Latin word "sapo," meaning "soap," combined with the suffix "-fication," indicating the process of making something.  The Latin word "sapo" itself may have origins in Celtic or Germanic languages.
