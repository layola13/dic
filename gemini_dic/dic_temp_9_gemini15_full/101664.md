词源:
The word "irrelative" is formed by adding the negative prefix "ir-" (meaning "not") to the word "relative."  "Relative" ultimately derives from the Latin word "relativus," meaning "related." Therefore, "irrelative" means "not related."  While less common than "irrelevant," it maintains a similar meaning and usage.
