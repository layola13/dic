funicle:/ˈfjuːnɪkl/| n. |珠柄；胚珠柄|The funicle is the stalk that attaches an ovule to the placenta in a plant's ovary. It is a crucial structure in plant reproduction, playing a role in nutrient transport and the positioning of the ovule for pollination and fertilization.  |Example: The funicle of the ovule is clearly visible under the microscope.  珠柄在显微镜下清晰可见。|近义词:ovule stalk, placental stalk|反义词: N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The funicle connects the ovule to the placenta. = 珠柄连接胚珠和胎座。
This plant's funicles are unusually long. = 这种植物的珠柄异常长。

一般过去时:
The botanist carefully examined the funicle. = 植物学家仔细检查了珠柄。
We observed the funicle's structure under a microscope. = 我们在显微镜下观察了珠柄的结构。

现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the funicle's role in seed development. = 科学家们已经研究了珠柄在种子发育中的作用。
Researchers have discovered a new type of funicle in this species. = 研究人员在这个物种中发现了一种新型的珠柄。

过去完成时:
Before fertilization, the funicle had already transported nutrients to the ovule. = 受精之前，珠柄已经将养分输送到胚珠。
They had analyzed the funicle's composition before publishing their findings. = 他们在发表研究结果之前已经分析了珠柄的成分。

将来时:
We will study the funicle's development in more detail. = 我们将更详细地研究珠柄的发育。
Future research will focus on the funicle's genetic regulation. = 未来的研究将集中在珠柄的基因调控上。

虚拟语气:
If the funicle were damaged, the ovule might not develop properly. = 如果珠柄受损，胚珠可能无法正常发育。
I wish I had known more about the funicle's structure before the experiment. = 我希望在实验之前对珠柄的结构有更多的了解。

被动语态:
The funicle's length was measured precisely. = 珠柄的长度被精确测量。
