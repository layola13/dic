prototheria:/ˌproʊtəˈθɪəriə/| n. |原兽亚纲|Prototheria is a subclass of mammals that includes the monotremes (echidnas and platypuses).  They are characterized by laying eggs instead of giving birth to live young, a characteristic that sets them apart from other mammals (Metatheria and Eutheria).  The name reflects their primitive characteristics, representing an early branch in mammalian evolution. |The platypus and echidnas are examples of prototheria.  They represent a unique lineage within mammals. |近义词:monotremes (as a group)|反义词:metatheria, eutheria

PHRASE->
There are not many common phrases directly using "prototheria" due to its scientific nature.  Instead, phrases would center around monotremes (the animals within the subclass).  Examples would include:  "the evolution of monotremes," "monotreme reproductive strategies," "monotreme physiology," "monotreme conservation," "monotreme fossils."
