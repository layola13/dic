词源:
The word "hydrotherapic" is derived from the combination of:

* **hydro-**: from Greek "hydor" (ὕδωρ), meaning "water."
* **therap-**: from Greek "therapeia" (θεραπεία), meaning "healing" or "treatment."
* **-ic**: a suffix forming adjectives, indicating "relating to" or "characteristic of."

Therefore, "hydrotherapic" literally means "relating to the healing or treatment with water."
