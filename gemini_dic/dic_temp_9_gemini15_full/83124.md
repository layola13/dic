2. A neologism: A newly coined word not yet widely accepted.  If this is the case, please provide context so its meaning and usage can be understood.

3. A word from another language:  It might be a word borrowed from another language. If so, please specify the language's origin.

4. A proper noun: It might be a proper noun (name of a person, place, or thing).  Again, more context is needed.
