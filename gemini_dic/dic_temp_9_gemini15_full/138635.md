nucleotides:/ˈnjuːklɪəˌtaɪdz/ | n. | 核苷酸 | Nucleotides are the basic building blocks of nucleic acids, such as DNA and RNA. They consist of a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon sugar (ribose or deoxyribose), and a phosphate group. |  The structure of DNA is determined by the sequence of nucleotides. DNA的结构是由核苷酸的序列决定的。|  The synthesis of nucleotides is crucial for cell growth and replication. 核苷酸的合成对于细胞生长和复制至关重要。|  近义词: nucleic acid components | 反义词: N/A
