epichirema: /ˌɛpɪˈkaɪrɪmə/ | n. |  辞格；论证法；论据 | A figure of speech in which a general proposition is stated and then applied to a particular case; a kind of enthymeme.  It involves stating a general principle, then a specific example, and drawing a conclusion. | The epichirema is a form of syllogism where both premises are proven. For example, "All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore, Socrates is mortal." This can be expressed as an epichirema:  "Socrates is mortal because he is a man, and all men are mortal."  | 近义词：enthymeme, syllogism | 反义词：None specifically, but its opposite would be a fallacious or illogical argument. |
