The word "faldistory" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  To provide a helpful response, I need clarification on the intended word.  Is there a similar-sounding word you meant to type, or can you provide context where you encountered this word?
