词源:  The word "mariachi" has a debated origin. One theory traces it to the Nahuatl word "mariache," possibly referring to a type of courtship dance or a specific type of festive gathering. Another theory suggests it comes from the French word "mariage," meaning "marriage," due to the frequent association of mariachi music with weddings.  Regardless of its precise origin, the word has become firmly associated with this distinctive Mexican musical genre.
