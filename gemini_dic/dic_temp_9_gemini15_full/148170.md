词源:
The word "overservile" combines the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with "servile," which comes from the Latin word "servilis," meaning "of or pertaining to a slave."  Therefore, "overservile" literally means "excessively like a slave," implying excessive submissiveness and fawning.
