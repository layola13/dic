mesoderm:/ˈmɛzədɜːrm/| n. |中胚层|The mesoderm is the middle layer of the three primary germ layers in the developing embryo of most animals.  It lies between the ectoderm (outer layer) and the endoderm (inner layer).  The mesoderm gives rise to a variety of tissues and organs, including muscle, bone, cartilage, blood, and connective tissue. |The mesoderm differentiates into various tissues and organs during embryonic development. |近义词：mesoblast|反义词：ectoderm, endoderm
