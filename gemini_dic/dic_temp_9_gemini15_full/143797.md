词源:

"Out" comes from Old English *ūt, meaning "outside," "outward," or "from within."  "Of" originates from Old English *of, a preposition with various meanings, including "from," "out of," "off," and "about." The combination "out of" developed naturally to express a more nuanced sense of origin, location, or circumstance than either word alone.
