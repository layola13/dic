词源:
The word "ouster" comes from the Old French word "oster," meaning "to remove" or "to take away."  This, in turn, is related to the Latin word "ostendere," meaning "to show," "to display," or "to present."  While the Latin root might seem unrelated, the semantic shift likely involved a sense of forcibly removing something from view or position.
