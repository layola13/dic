gradient:/ˈɡreɪdiənt/ | n. | 梯度；倾斜度；坡度 | A gradient is a rate of increase or decrease of a quantity, usually with respect to space or time.  It often refers to the slope of a line or surface,  but can also apply to other changes, such as temperature or pressure. | Example: The steep gradient of the hill made climbing difficult.  这陡峭的山坡使攀登变得困难。 The temperature gradient across the room was significant.  房间里的温度梯度很大。 |近义词：slope, incline, grade, rate of change | 反义词：level, flat


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The temperature gradient is high today. = 今天的温度梯度很高。
The slope gradient is gentle here. = 这里的坡度很缓。

一般过去时:
The pressure gradient was significant yesterday. = 昨天的压力梯度很大。
The road gradient was steeper than expected. = 道路坡度比预期的更陡峭。

现在完成时:
The researchers have measured the concentration gradient. = 研究人员已经测量了浓度梯度。
Scientists have observed a significant change in the temperature gradient. = 科学家们已经观察到温度梯度发生了显著变化。

过去完成时:
The engineers had calculated the land gradient before construction. = 工程师们在施工前已经计算了地面的坡度。
The climbers had underestimated the mountain's gradient. = 登山者低估了山坡的坡度。

将来时:
The city planners will assess the terrain gradient. = 城市规划者将评估地形的坡度。
We will measure the pressure gradient tomorrow. = 我们明天将测量压力梯度。

虚拟语气:
If the gradient were steeper, the water would flow faster. = 如果坡度更陡峭，水流速度会更快。
I wish the learning curve gradient were less steep. = 我希望学习曲线的梯度不那么陡峭。

被动语态:
The gradient was carefully measured by the surveyors. = 坡度由测量员仔细测量。
The concentration gradient is being studied by the scientists. = 浓度梯度正在被科学家们研究。

疑问句:
What is the gradient of this hill? = 这座山的坡度是多少？
What is the temperature gradient across the material? = 材料上的温度梯度是多少？

否定句:
The gradient is not steep enough for skiing. = 坡度不够陡峭，不适合滑雪。
The pressure gradient was not as significant as predicted. = 压力梯度不如预测的那么显著。
