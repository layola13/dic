词源:
The word "outcompliment" is a relatively modern formation.  It's a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent than") and the verb "compliment" (to praise).  The "out-" prefix creates a sense of surpassing or exceeding the typical level of complimenting.  There's no ancient or established etymology like some older words; it's a straightforward combination of existing words to create a new nuance.
