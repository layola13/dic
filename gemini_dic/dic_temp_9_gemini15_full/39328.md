词源:

The word "conjectural" comes from the Latin word "conjecturalis," which is derived from "conjectūra," meaning "guess," "conjecture," or "inference."  The prefix "con-" means "together," and "jacere" means "to throw."  Therefore, the original sense implied throwing together ideas or thoughts to form a guess.
