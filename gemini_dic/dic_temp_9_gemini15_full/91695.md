hyperconformities:/ˌhaɪpər kənˈfɔːrmətiz/ | n. | 超一致性；过度顺从 |  Hyperconformities refer to instances where geological formations or structures exhibit an unusually high degree of conformity or parallel alignment, exceeding what would be expected from typical geological processes.  These often indicate significant tectonic events or specific depositional environments. For example, extensive parallel bedding planes in sedimentary rocks could be considered a hyperconformity if they extend over a vast area and show remarkably consistent orientation despite potential variations in underlying geology. | The extensive hyperconformities observed in the Appalachian Mountains suggest a period of intense regional compression. | 近义词：parallelism, alignment, uniformity | 反义词：discordance, unconformity
