self-impregnation: /ˌsɛlf ɪmˌprɛɡˈneɪʃən/ | n. | 自我受精 | The process by which an organism fertilizes its own eggs or ovules.  This is common in some plants and certain hermaphroditic animals.  It contrasts with cross-fertilization, where genetic material comes from two different individuals. | Example:  Self-impregnation is a reproductive strategy employed by many species of flowering plants.  自我受精是许多开花植物采用的繁殖策略。


近义词：autogamy, self-fertilization | 反义词：cross-fertilization, allogamy


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Self-impregnation occurs in many plant species. = 许多植物物种都会发生自我受精。
The flower undergoes self-impregnation. = 这朵花正在进行自我受精。

一般过去时:
Self-impregnation was observed in the sample. = 在样本中观察到了自我受精。
The plant completed self-impregnation successfully. = 这株植物成功完成了自我受精。

现在完成时:
Scientists have documented many cases of self-impregnation. = 科学家们已经记录了许多自我受精的案例。
The research has shown the benefits of self-impregnation in certain environments. = 研究表明，在某些环境中，自我受精是有益的。

过去完成时:
The plant had already undergone self-impregnation before the experiment began. = 在实验开始之前，这株植物就已经完成了自我受精。
Researchers had hypothesized that self-impregnation was less efficient. = 研究人员曾假设自我受精效率较低。

将来时:
The study will investigate the genetic consequences of self-impregnation. = 这项研究将调查自我受精的遗传后果。
We will observe if self-impregnation occurs in this new species. = 我们将观察这种新物种是否会发生自我受精。

虚拟语气:
If the plant were capable of self-impregnation, it would reproduce more easily. = 如果这种植物能够进行自我受精，它将更容易繁殖。
It is unlikely that self-impregnation would lead to significant genetic diversity. = 自我受精不太可能导致显著的遗传多样性。

被动语态:
Self-impregnation was thought to be rare until recently. = 直到最近，自我受精才被认为是罕见的。
The process of self-impregnation is being studied extensively. = 自我受精的过程正在被广泛研究。

疑问句:
Does self-impregnation always result in viable offspring? = 自我受精是否总是导致可存活的后代？
Can self-impregnation lead to inbreeding depression? = 自我受精会导致近亲繁殖衰退吗？

否定句:
This species does not exhibit self-impregnation. = 这个物种不表现出自我受精。
The experiment failed to demonstrate self-impregnation. = 实验未能证明自我受精。
