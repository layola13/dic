词源:
The word "gloomily" derives from the adjective "gloomy," which in turn originates from the Middle English word "glom," meaning "twilight" or "darkness."  This ultimately relates to Old English words connected to "glow" and the idea of dim light. The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner in which something is done.
