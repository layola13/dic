词源:  Derived from "cherub," which ultimately comes from the Hebrew word כרוב (keruv), meaning "to cover," "to guard," or "guardian."  In the Old Testament, cherubim were depicted as powerful, winged creatures guarding the divine presence. Over time, the image evolved into the more familiar cherubic representation of an innocent, chubby child with wings.
