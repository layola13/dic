词源:

The word "overorchestrated" is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to an excessive degree) and "orchestrated" (from "orchestrate," meaning to arrange or organize, especially in a complex or elaborate way, derived from "orchestra").  Therefore, the word literally means "excessively arranged or organized."
