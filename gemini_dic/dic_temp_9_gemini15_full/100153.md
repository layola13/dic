interradius: /ˌɪntərˈreɪdiəs/ | n. | 半径间距，半径之间距离 | The distance between two radii of a circle or other curved figure.  It often refers to the space or area between the radii.  The term is less common than other ways of describing the space between radii. | Example: The interradius of the spokes on the wheel was carefully measured to ensure even spacing. 半轮辐之间的间距经过仔细测量以确保均匀。|近义词: radial spacing, interval between radii | 反义词:  radius (as a single radius is the opposite of a space between radii)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The interradius between the spokes remains constant. = 轮辐之间的间距保持不变。
What is the interradius of this circle? = 这个圆的半径间距是多少？


一般过去时:
The interradius was too narrow for the cables. = 半径间距对于电缆来说太窄了。
We measured the interradius of the fan blades. = 我们测量了风扇叶片的半径间距。


现在完成时:
Engineers have calculated the interradius precisely. = 工程师们已经精确计算出半径间距。
They have found that the interradius affects the stability. = 他们发现半径间距影响稳定性。


过去完成时:
The technicians had already checked the interradius before assembly. = 技术人员在组装前已经检查了半径间距。
We had underestimated the significance of the interradius. = 我们低估了半径间距的重要性。


将来时:
The designers will adjust the interradius to improve performance. = 设计师们将调整半径间距以提高性能。
We will need to recalculate the interradius based on new data. = 我们需要根据新的数据重新计算半径间距。


虚拟语气:
If the interradius were larger, the system would be more stable. = 如果半径间距更大，系统将更稳定。
I wish the interradius had been wider. = 我希望半径间距更宽一些。


被动语态:
The interradius was carefully measured by the technician. = 半径间距由技术人员仔细测量。
The interradius is being adjusted to optimize the design. = 半径间距正在被调整以优化设计。


疑问句:
What is the required interradius for this application? = 此应用所需的半径间距是多少？
How do we determine the optimal interradius? = 我们如何确定最佳半径间距？


否定句:
The interradius is not sufficient for this application. = 半径间距对于此应用来说不够。
The engineers did not initially consider the interradius. = 工程师们最初没有考虑半径间距。
