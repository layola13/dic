词源: From Late Latin hypotenusa, from Greek hypoteinousa (fem. of hypoteinōn), present participle of hypoteinein "to stretch under," from hypo- "under" + teinein "to stretch."  The term reflects the fact that the hypotenuse is the side opposite the right angle, "stretched under" the other two sides.
