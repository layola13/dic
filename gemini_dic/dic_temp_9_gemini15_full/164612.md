词源：
The word "preexhausted" is a relatively modern coinage, formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") with the adjective "exhausted."  "Exhausted" itself derives from the verb "exhaust," ultimately from Old French "exhauster" (to empty, drain), from Latin "exhaurire" (to draw out, drain).
