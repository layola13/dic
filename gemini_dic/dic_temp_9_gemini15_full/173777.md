词源:

* **quasi-**:  from Latin, meaning "as if," "seemingly," or "to a certain extent."  It indicates something that resembles or partially possesses a certain quality.

* **patriotic**: from Greek "patria" (fatherland) + "-otic" (a suffix indicating relation or belonging).


用法说明:

This word is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that exhibits some aspects of patriotism but lacks its full depth, sincerity, or genuine commitment.  It often suggests a superficial or insincere expression of national pride.  The "quasi-" prefix softens the meaning, indicating a partial or incomplete form of patriotism.  The term is often used in critical or analytical contexts to highlight a discrepancy between outward displays of patriotism and underlying motivations or actions.
