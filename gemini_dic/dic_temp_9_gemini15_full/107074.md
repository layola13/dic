laddering: /ˈlædəriŋ/ | n. |阶梯式营销；阶梯式策略|

英文解析:Laddering is a marketing technique used to understand consumer motivations and the deeper meanings behind their purchases.  It involves asking a series of "why" questions to uncover the underlying reasons for a consumer's choices, moving from concrete product attributes to more abstract values and beliefs.  The goal is to identify the consumer's core values and how those values connect to their purchasing decisions.  This information can then be used to develop more effective marketing strategies.


例句:
The market research team used laddering to understand why consumers chose Brand X over its competitors. = 市场调研团队使用阶梯式营销来了解为什么消费者选择X品牌而不是其竞争对手。

Our marketing campaign focuses on connecting our product to the core values revealed through laddering interviews. = 我们的营销活动侧重于将我们的产品与通过阶梯式访谈揭示的核心价值联系起来。


近义词:Means-end analysis, value-based segmentation


反义词:None directly applicable.  The opposite would be a superficial marketing approach that doesn't explore deeper consumer motivations.
