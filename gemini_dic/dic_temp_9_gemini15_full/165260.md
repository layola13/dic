preinsulations:/ˌpriːɪnsʊˈleɪʃənz/| n. |预先保温层，预制保温材料|Preinsulations refers to insulation materials that are applied to pipes, vessels, or other equipment during the manufacturing process, providing a factory-installed layer of thermal protection.  This method often results in better insulation performance and easier installation compared to on-site insulation.| Example: The preinsulations on the pipelines significantly reduced energy loss during transportation. 预制保温管道大大减少了运输过程中的能量损失。|近义词：factory-applied insulation, pre-insulated piping |反义词：on-site insulation
