词源:

The word "incommensurately" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), "commensurate" (meaning "proportionate," "corresponding in size or degree"), and the suffix "-ly" (forming adverbs).  "Commensurate" itself comes from Latin "commensuratus," the past participle of "commensurāre," meaning "to measure together."


USAGE->

This word is primarily used as an adverb to modify verbs, adjectives, or entire clauses.  There isn't a specific tense conjugation as it's an adverb, not a verb.  It can be used in various sentence structures and doesn't change its form based on tense.

Examples showing its use in different sentence structures:

Declarative sentence: The damage was incommensurately great. (灾害损失极其巨大。)

Interrogative sentence: Was the effort incommensurately rewarded? (努力获得了不成比例的回报吗？)

Exclamatory sentence: Incommensurately large! (极其巨大！)


Note:  Because "incommensurately" describes a relationship between two things, it is often found in sentences comparing two entities or quantities.
