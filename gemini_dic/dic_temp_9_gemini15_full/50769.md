词源:  The word "desaturates" is formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse") to the verb "saturate". "Saturate" comes from the Latin word "saturare," meaning "to fill to the full,"  ultimately related to "satus," meaning "enough, sufficient".  Therefore, "desaturate" means to remove the fullness or intensity of color.
