词源:
The word "flip-flops" originates from the sound the sandals make when worn.  The onomatopoeia reflects the slapping sound of the sole against the ground. The term's usage as a description of changing opinions is a later development, a metaphorical extension based on the idea of quick, back-and-forth movement.
