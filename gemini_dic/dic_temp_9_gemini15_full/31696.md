词源:  The word "chauvinistic" is derived from the name Nicolas Chauvin, a legendary French soldier who was excessively loyal to Napoleon.  His unwavering devotion, though fictionalized, became synonymous with excessive patriotism and blind allegiance to one's own group or cause.  The term was later broadened to include male chauvinism, reflecting an exaggerated sense of male superiority.
