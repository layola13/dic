The word "gavelet" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  It is possible that this is:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* **A neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.  If this is the case, please provide more context about where you encountered the word.
* **A proper noun:**  It might be a name or place name not widely known.


Please provide more information or correct the spelling so I can assist you.
