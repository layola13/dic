词源:
The word "hostessing" is derived from the noun "hostess," which itself comes from the Old English word "hūses," meaning "house."  The "-ess" suffix indicates a female role or occupation.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the act of welcoming and entertaining guests, not just managing a household.
