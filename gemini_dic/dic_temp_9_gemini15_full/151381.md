词源:
The word "parley" comes from the Anglo-French word "parler," meaning "to speak."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "parabolare," meaning "to speak comparably," which is related to the Greek word "parabole," meaning "comparison, parable."  The evolution reflects the sense of a formal, often carefully considered, exchange of words.
