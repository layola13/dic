/ˌsemiəˈblɪviəsnəsɪz/ | n. | 半忘却的状态；部分遗忘的事物 |  The word "semiobliviousnesses" is a rare and unusual word, formed by combining "semi-" (meaning "partly" or "half"), "oblivious" (meaning "not aware of or not concerned about something"), and "-nesses" (a plural noun suffix).  It refers to instances or states of being partly unaware or forgetful.  The word is highly uncommon in everyday language and would likely only be used in very specific, academic, or literary contexts.  Due to its rarity, finding common usage examples or synonyms is difficult.   There are no readily available antonyms because it describes a state rather than a direct action.
