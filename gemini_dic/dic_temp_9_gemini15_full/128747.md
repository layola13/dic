词源:
The word "niggardly" ultimately derives from the Old Norse word "niggurðr," meaning "miser," "stingy person," or "niggard."  The word entered English through Middle English.  It's important to note the word's unfortunate connection to a racial slur. While historically distinct, the phonetic similarity has led to its avoidance in modern usage due to the risk of causing offense.
