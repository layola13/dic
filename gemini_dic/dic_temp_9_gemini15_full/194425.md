self-referring: /ˌsɛlf rɪˈfɜːrɪŋ/ | adj. | 自指的，自我参照的 | Relating to or denoting a system or process that refers to or includes itself;  capable of referring to itself.  A self-referring statement or system contains a reference to itself within its own structure or definition. | 例句：The sentence "This sentence is false" is a classic example of a self-referring statement. 这句话“这句话是错的”就是一个经典的自指陈述的例子。

近义词：recursive, reflexive, autoreferential | 反义词：external, objective, non-recursive


词源：The word is a compound of "self" and "referring". "Self" is an Old English word meaning "own" or "same," and "referring" is derived from the verb "refer," from Old French "referrer" and ultimately from Latin "referre," meaning "to bring back," "to carry back."  Therefore, "self-referring" literally means "referring back to itself."
