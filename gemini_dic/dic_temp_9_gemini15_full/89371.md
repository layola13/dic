homonymy:/ˈhɒmənɪmi/| /ˈhɑːmənɪmi/| n.|同音异义词|The state of being homonyms; the existence of two or more words with the same spelling and pronunciation but different meanings.  Homonymy refers to words that share the same spelling and pronunciation but have different meanings. This is distinct from polysemy, where a single word has multiple related meanings.|Example: The word "bank" can refer to a financial institution or the land alongside a river. These are homonyms because they sound the same and are spelled the same but have unrelated meanings.|近义词：synonymy (in contrast, as it refers to words with the same meaning), polysemy (a related but distinct concept)|反义词：无
