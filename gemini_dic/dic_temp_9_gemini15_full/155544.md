词源:The word "philistine" originates from the biblical Philistines, a people who were often depicted as enemies of the Israelites and associated with materialism and a lack of spiritual or cultural refinement.  The term's modern usage developed in the 19th century, gaining popularity through the writings of Matthew Arnold, who used it to criticize the lack of appreciation for high culture in Victorian England.
