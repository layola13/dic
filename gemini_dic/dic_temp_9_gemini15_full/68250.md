词源:

The word "faithful" comes from the Old English word "fæþe", meaning "faith," and the suffix "-ful," meaning "full of."  Therefore, "faithful" literally means "full of faith" or "trustworthy."  The Old English "fæþe" itself has roots in Proto-Germanic and ultimately connects to even older Indo-European roots related to trust and belief.
