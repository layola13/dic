词源:

The word "dislodgment" is derived from the verb "dislodge," which itself is a combination of the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away," "off," or "reverse") and the verb "lodge."  "Lodge" originally meant to place or settle something, often in a sheltered or secure spot.  Therefore, "dislodge" means to remove something from its place, and "dislodgment" is the noun form describing this action or the resulting state.  The ultimate origin of "lodge" traces back to Old English and Germanic roots related to shelter and settling.
