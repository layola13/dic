词源:  The word "digitalising" is derived from "digital" (relating to or using digits or numerals in calculations or data processing) and the suffix "-ising," which is a common suffix in English used to form verbs indicating the process of making something become something else.  The root "digit" itself comes from the Latin word "digitus," meaning "finger" or "toe," reflecting the historical use of fingers for counting.
