词源:  The word "predemanding" is a relatively recent coinage, formed by adding the prefix "pre-" (suggesting something before or in advance) to the word "demanding." While "pre-" doesn't significantly alter the core meaning, it could arguably imply that the demands are made before they are fully justified or understood. However, this nuance is subtle and not consistently applied in usage.  The word essentially functions as a stronger form of "demanding."
