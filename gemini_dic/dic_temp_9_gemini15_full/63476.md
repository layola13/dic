词源:

The word "entropy" was coined by the German physicist Rudolf Clausius in 1865.  It is derived from the Greek word "ἐντροπία" (entropia), which means "a turning inwards" or "transformation". Clausius chose this term to represent the tendency of energy to become less available for work as a system moves towards equilibrium.


用法说明:

"Entropy's" is the possessive form of "entropy," indicating that something belongs to or is related to entropy.  It's typically used in scientific or technical contexts to describe a characteristic or property of entropy.  It's not commonly used in everyday conversation.  For example, one might discuss "entropy's effects on a system" or "entropy's role in a chemical reaction."  It is not used in tenses, as it is a noun.  There are no typical examples of entropy's usage across different tenses because it is not a verb.  The word itself is always used in the same form, as the possessive form of a noun.
