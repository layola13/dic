词源:

The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to an excessive degree) and "romanticize" (to idealize or make romantic).  "Romanticize" itself has roots in "romance," ultimately deriving from the Vulgar Latin *romancia ("romance language").  The shift to the sense of idealizing or sentimentalizing happened over time.
