The word "courtepy" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Perhaps you could provide more context where you encountered this word.
2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name, place, or brand.
3. **It's a neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or a word used within a specific community.
4. **It's a word from another language:**  It might have been transliterated incorrectly.


To provide the requested analysis, I need a valid English word. Please double-check the spelling or provide more information.
