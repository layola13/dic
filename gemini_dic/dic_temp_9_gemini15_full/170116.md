protocells:/ˈproʊtoʊsɛlz/ | n. | 原细胞 | A protocell is a self-organized, endogenously ordered, spherical collection of lipids proposed as a stepping-stone to the origin of life.  They are considered precursors to the first living cells, lacking the complex organization of modern cells but exhibiting some life-like properties such as metabolism and reproduction. |  Scientists are studying protocells to understand how life might have originated on Earth. |近义词：precursor, prebiotic vesicle | 反义词：cell (in the sense of a fully developed cell)
