词源:
The word "instinct" comes from the late Middle English word "instinct," which itself is derived from the Old French word "instinct," meaning "incitement, impulse."  This ultimately traces back to the Latin word "instinctus," the past participle of "instingere," meaning "to instigate, prompt, or urge on."
