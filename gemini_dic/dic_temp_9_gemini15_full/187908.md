rotacism:/ˈroʊtəsɪzəm/ | n. | 转音；r音化；卷舌音化 | The substitution of one sound for another, especially the substitution of /r/ for another consonant or vowel.  This can manifest as the pronunciation of a non-r sound as an r sound, or vice versa.  It is often a speech impediment or a regional dialect feature. | Example:  A common rotacism is the substitution of /l/ for /r/, resulting in words like "rabbit" being pronounced as "wabbit".  Another example is the rhotic r, which is pronounced differently in various English dialects. | 近义词：sound substitution, speech impediment (in some contexts) | 反义词：None directly applicable; the opposite would be the *absence* of rotacism.
