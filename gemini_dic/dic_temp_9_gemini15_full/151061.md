词源:

The word "paraphrastical" is derived from the Greek word "παράφρασις" (paraphrasis), which means "a saying alongside" or "a rewording."  "Para-" means "beside" or "alongside," and "phrasis" refers to "speech" or "phrase." Thus, the root meaning points to a restatement or explanation of something, using different words.
