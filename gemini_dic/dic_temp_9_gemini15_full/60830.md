electroscope:/ɪˈlɛktrəskoʊp/ | n. |验电器 | An electroscope is a scientific instrument used to detect the presence and sign of an electrostatic charge.  It typically consists of a pair of lightweight leaves (often gold) that diverge when charged. | Example: The electroscope showed a positive charge. 验电器显示出正电荷。  The teacher used an electroscope to demonstrate static electricity. 老师用验电器演示静电。 | 近义词：electrostatic detector | 反义词：无
