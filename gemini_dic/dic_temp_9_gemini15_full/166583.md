There is no standard usage section for a word like "prescriptivenesses," as it's a relatively uncommon and somewhat artificially formed plural.  The word itself is derived from "prescriptiveness," which describes the act or nature of prescribing or being prescriptive. Let's break down the word's formation and meaning:

* **prescriptive:**  /prɪˈskrɪptɪv/ adj.  Laying down rules or principles; giving instructions.  (规定性的，指令性的)

* **prescriptiveness:** /prɪˌskrɪptɪvnəs/ n. The quality or state of being prescriptive; the tendency to prescribe or impose rules. (规定性，强制性)

* **prescriptivenesses:** /prɪˌskrɪptɪvˈnɛsɪz/ n. (Plural of prescriptiveness) Multiple instances or aspects of prescriptiveness.  This word is rarely used in everyday language;  it's generally better to use a different phrasing to convey the intended meaning.  For example, instead of "the multiple prescriptivenesses," you could say "the numerous rules," "the various prescriptions," or "the many restrictive elements."

**Example sentences demonstrating the concept of prescriptiveness (and avoiding the awkward plural):**

* **The prescriptiveness of the grammar rules stifled creativity.** 语法规则的强制性扼杀了创造力。
* **He disliked the prescriptiveness of the traditional approach.** 他不喜欢传统方法的强制性。
* **The document's prescriptiveness left little room for interpretation.**  该文件的规定性几乎没有留下任何解释的空间。
* **There are many prescriptive elements in the new regulations.** 新规章中有很多强制性规定。
* **The prescriptiveness in their teaching style limited student engagement.** 他们教学风格中的强制性限制了学生的参与度。

Because "prescriptivenesses" is not a commonly used word, providing typical usage examples across various grammatical tenses, moods, or voices is impractical and would be artificial.  The focus should be on understanding and using the singular form, "prescriptiveness," appropriately and choosing alternative phrasing for multiple instances of prescriptiveness.
