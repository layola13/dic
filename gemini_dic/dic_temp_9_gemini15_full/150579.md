词源：
The word "papejay" is an older, now largely obsolete, variant of "parrot." Its etymology traces back to the Old French "papegay," itself derived from the Medieval Latin "papagalus," a variant of "papagallus."  The ultimate origin is likely from a combination of elements from various languages spoken in the regions where parrots originated, with connections proposed to African and Asian languages.  The precise origins and evolution are still debated by etymologists.
