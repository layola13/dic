The word "exedent" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage to provide.  It might be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a technical term from a very specialized field, or a word from a fictional language.  More context is needed to determine its possible meaning.
