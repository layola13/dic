词源:
The word "ramshackle" is of uncertain origin.  It likely arose in the 18th or 19th century from a combination of "ram" (meaning to strike or batter) and "shackle" (meaning a fetter or restraint).  The combination suggests something battered and loosely held together.  The exact pathway of its linguistic development is still debated.
