词源:
From Middle French métropolitain, from Late Latin metropolitanus, from Greek μητροπόλις (mētropolis, "mother city").  The Greek word itself combines μήτηρ (mētēr, "mother") and πόλις (polis, "city").  The term originally referred to the chief city of a province or region, and its associated administrative area.  Over time, its meaning evolved to encompass the broader idea of a large, important urban center.
