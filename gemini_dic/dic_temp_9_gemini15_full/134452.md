词源:

The word "nonitemizer" is a compound word formed from "non-" (meaning "not") and "itemizer" (a person who itemizes).  "Itemizer" derives from "itemize," which comes from "item" (a single thing in a list) and the suffix "-ize" (to make or treat as something).  Therefore, the etymology traces back to the basic concept of listing individual items.
