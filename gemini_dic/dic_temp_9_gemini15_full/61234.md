The term is a compound word, combining "email" (electronic mail) and "bombs" (referencing the explosive effect of a large influx of emails).  The term's origin can be traced back to the rise of the internet and email, as it describes a malicious or disruptive tactic that emerged alongside the increasing use of email communication.
