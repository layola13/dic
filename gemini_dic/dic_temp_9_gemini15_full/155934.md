photodynamics:/ˌfoʊtoʊdaɪˈnæmɪks/ | n. | 光动力学 | The interaction of light with matter, particularly the study of the effects of light on biological systems.  It encompasses the absorption of light by a photosensitizer, the subsequent generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and their interaction with biological targets, ultimately leading to cellular damage or therapeutic effects. | Example: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a form of cancer treatment that uses photodynamics to destroy tumor cells. 光动力疗法 (PDT) 是一种利用光动力学破坏癌细胞的癌症治疗方法。|近义词：photobiology, photochemistry |反义词：None specifically, but concepts like "darkness" or "absence of light" could be considered contrasting. |名词
