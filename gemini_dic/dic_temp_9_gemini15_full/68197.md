词源：fair (adj.) + mindedness (n.)  "Fair" originates from Old English "fæger," meaning "beautiful, pleasing, lucky,"  and later developed the sense of "just, equitable." "Mindedness" is derived from "mind" (Old English "gemynd")  + "-edness," a suffix indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, fair-mindedness literally means "the state of having a fair mind."
