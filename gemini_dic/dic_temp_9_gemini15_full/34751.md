词源:
The word "client" comes from the Latin word "cliens," meaning "dependent," "protector," or "follower." In Roman society, a "cliens" was a person who was under the protection of a more powerful patron. Over time, the word evolved to refer to someone who seeks the services of a professional, such as a lawyer or consultant.
