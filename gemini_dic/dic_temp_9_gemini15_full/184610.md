词源:
The word "restrained" comes from the verb "restrain," which is formed from the Old French prefix "re-" (again, back) and the Old French word "estraindre" (to bind, to constrain).  "Estraindre" itself is derived from the Latin "stringere" (to bind, to tighten).  Therefore, "restrained" ultimately means "bound back" or "held back."
