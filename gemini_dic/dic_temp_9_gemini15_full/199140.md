词源:

The word "silhouette" originates from Étienne de Silhouette (1709-1767), a French finance minister known for his frugality.  During his time, inexpensive portraits were created as simple outlines, filled in with solid black, and these became known as "à la Silhouette" (in the style of Silhouette), eventually shortening to "silhouette".
