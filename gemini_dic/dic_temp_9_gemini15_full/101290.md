词源:  The word "involvement" is derived from the verb "involve," which comes from the Old French word "envolver," meaning "to wrap up," "to envelop," or "to involve."  The prefix "in-" signifies "in" or "into," and "-volve" relates to the Latin word "volvere," meaning "to roll" or "to turn."  Thus, the original sense implied a wrapping up or envelopment in something. Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass participation and entanglement.
