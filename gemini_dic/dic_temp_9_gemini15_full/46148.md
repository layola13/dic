The word "cymous" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  There is no pronunciation, grammatical function, definition, examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., because the word itself is not recognized.  It might be a misspelling, a newly coined word, or a word from a very specialized field.
