词源:

The word "reregistration" is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") and the noun "registration."  "Registration" comes from the verb "register," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "registrare," meaning "to enroll, record, or enter in a register."  Therefore, "reregistration" literally means "to register again."
