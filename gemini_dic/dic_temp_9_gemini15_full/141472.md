The word "opinionate" comes from the noun "opinion," ultimately derived from the Latin word "opinio," meaning "opinion, belief, judgment." The suffix "-ate" transforms nouns into adjectives, indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, "opinionate" literally means "full of opinions" or "characterized by having opinions."


用法说明：
opinionate主要用作形容词，修饰人或其行为。它通常带有负面含义，暗示此人过于坚持己见，不考虑其他观点，甚至可能显得傲慢无理。
