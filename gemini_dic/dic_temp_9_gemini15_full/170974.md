pseudoprime:/ˈsuːdoʊpraɪm/|/ˈsjuːdəʊpraɪm/| n. |伪素数|A composite number that satisfies the congruence  a<sup>p-1</sup>≡1 (mod p) for all integers a that are relatively prime to p, where p is a pseudoprime.  This property is shared by prime numbers, making pseudoprimality a test that can sometimes fail to identify composite numbers.  There are different types of pseudoprimes, depending on the specific congruence relation used. |Example: 561 is a Carmichael number, a type of pseudoprime.  561 is a composite number (3 × 11 × 17), but it satisfies the congruence a<sup>560</sup>≡1 (mod 560) for all integers a relatively prime to 560.  |近义词:composite number (in the context of failing primality tests)|反义词:prime number|名词

The test identified the number as a pseudoprime. = 测试将该数字识别为伪素数。


Simple Past Tense:
The algorithm found a pseudoprime. = 算法找到一个伪素数。
They checked if the number was a pseudoprime. = 他们检查了该数字是否是伪素数。


Present Perfect Tense:
Mathematicians have discovered many pseudoprimes. = 数学家们已经发现了许多伪素数。
We have confirmed that it is a pseudoprime. = 我们已经确认它是一个伪素数。


Past Perfect Tense:
They had already identified the number as a pseudoprime. = 他们已经将该数字识别为伪素数。
Before the test, I had suspected it was a pseudoprime. = 在测试之前，我怀疑它是一个伪素数。


Future Tense:
We will find more pseudoprimes. = 我们将找到更多伪素数。
The research will explore the properties of pseudoprimes. = 该研究将探讨伪素数的特性。


Passive Voice:
The pseudoprime was identified by the test. = 伪素数由测试识别。
Many pseudoprimes have been discovered. = 许多伪素数已被发现。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "pseudoprime" as it is a relatively specialized mathematical term.  However, it's commonly used in phrases describing its properties or related concepts:
