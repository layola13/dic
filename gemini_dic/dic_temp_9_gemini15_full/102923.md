词源:

The term "jayhawker" originates from the American Civil War era and its precise etymology is uncertain.  One theory suggests it's a combination of "jay," referring to a mischievous blue jay, and "hawker," meaning a peddler or itinerant trader.  This combination possibly reflects the perceived cunning and opportunistic nature of these irregular soldiers. Another theory links it to the name "Jay" and "Hawkins," which were possibly the names of some early jayhawkers. The term became especially associated with the pro-Union guerrillas in Kansas and Missouri during "Bleeding Kansas," reflecting the chaotic and violent nature of the conflict.
