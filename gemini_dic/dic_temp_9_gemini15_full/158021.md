词源:
From Middle English plantacioun, from Old French plantation, from planter "to plant," from Latin plantare.  The meaning evolved from the act of planting to the place where planting is done, particularly on a large scale.  The association with slavery and colonial exploitation is a later development tied to its historical usage.
