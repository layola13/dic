词源:
The term "ring-fencing" is a relatively recent addition to the English language, originating in the 20th century.  It's a figurative expression, drawing an analogy to the physical act of surrounding an area with a fence or wall to keep things in or out.  The "ring" emphasizes the complete encirclement and protection.  The exact origin and first recorded usage are difficult to pinpoint definitively but its use became more common in financial and business contexts.
