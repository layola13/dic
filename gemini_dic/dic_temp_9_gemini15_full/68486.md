词源:
The word "familys" is the plural of "family," which originates from the Latin word "familia," meaning "household," "family," or "servants."  The Latin word itself has roots in the word "famulus," meaning "servant."  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the broader concept of a family unit.
