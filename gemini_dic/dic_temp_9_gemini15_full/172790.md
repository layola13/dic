USAGE->
This word is rarely used in modern English and doesn't lend itself to typical grammatical tense examples in the way "what" does.  Its usage is almost exclusively limited to descriptive contexts.  Therefore, providing examples for all tenses would be artificial and unhelpful.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "quadrijugous".  The word itself is highly specialized.
