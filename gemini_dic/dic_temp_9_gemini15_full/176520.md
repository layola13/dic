一般过去时:
The surface re-radiated the heat it had absorbed. = 表面重新辐射出它吸收的热量。
The building re-radiated the sunlight throughout the day. = 建筑物在白天重新辐射阳光。

现在完成时:
The planet has re-radiated much of the incoming solar radiation. = 这颗行星已经重新辐射了大部分的入射太阳辐射。
The material has re-radiated the absorbed energy as infrared light. = 材料已将吸收的能量作为红外光重新辐射出来。

过去完成时:
The atmosphere had re-radiated most of the heat before morning. = 在早晨之前，大气层已经重新辐射了大部分的热量。
The object had re-radiated the energy before the measurement. = 物体在测量之前已经重新辐射了能量。


将来时:
