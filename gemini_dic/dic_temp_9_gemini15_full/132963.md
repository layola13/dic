/nɒnɪmˈpɪrɪsɪzəm/ | n. | 非经验主义 | Nonempiricism refers to philosophical positions that reject or downplay the role of empirical evidence (sensory experience and observation) in the formation of knowledge or justification of beliefs.  It often emphasizes reason, intuition, revelation, or other non-sensory sources of knowledge.  Different forms of nonempiricism exist, each with varying degrees of skepticism towards empirical data. |  Some philosophers argue that pure mathematics is a form of nonempiricism, as its truths are not derived from observation but from logical deduction.  Another example could be certain theological beliefs, based on faith and revelation rather than empirical proof. | 近义词：rationalism, intuitionism, apriorism | 反义词：empiricism, positivism
