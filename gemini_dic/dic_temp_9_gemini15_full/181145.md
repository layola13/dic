词源:
The word "reinfluences" is formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "anew") to the verb "influences".  The root word "influence" ultimately derives from Old French "influence," which itself comes from Latin "influentia," meaning "an inflow,"  from "influere" (to flow in).  The Latin root reflects the astrological concept of celestial bodies' effects on earthly events.
