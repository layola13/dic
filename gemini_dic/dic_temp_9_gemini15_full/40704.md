The word "convertend" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word not yet widely recognized.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis following the requested format.  To help, I need clarification on the intended word. Is it a misspelling of another word?  If so, please provide the correct spelling.
