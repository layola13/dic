sigma:/ˈsɪɡmə/|/ˈsɪɡmɑː/| n. |西格玛；Σ；标准差；总和|The Greek letter sigma (Σ) is often used to represent summation in mathematics.  Sigma also refers to a measure of statistical dispersion, indicating how spread out a dataset is. |例句：The sum of the series is represented by the Greek letter sigma (Σ).  希腊字母西格玛（Σ）常用来表示数学中的求和。|例句：The standard deviation, often denoted by sigma (σ), measures the spread of data around the mean. 标准差，通常用西格玛 (σ) 表示，测量数据围绕平均值的离散程度。|近义词：sum, total, deviation, standard deviation |反义词：N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The sigma value represents the standard deviation. = 西格玛值代表标准差。
Sigma measures the dispersion of data. = 西格玛测量数据的离散程度。

一般过去时:
