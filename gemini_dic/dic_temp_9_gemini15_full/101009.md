invaluablenesses:/ˌɪnˈvæljʊəblˈnɛsɪz/ | n. | 无价之宝的众多；极其宝贵的事物 | The invaluablenesses of his contributions to the field are widely recognized.  他的对该领域的贡献的巨大价值已被广泛认可。| 近义词：incalculable values, priceless treasures | 反义词：worthlessnesses


This word is not commonly used. It's a plural form of "invaluableness," which itself is less common than the adjective "invaluable."  The word is formed by adding the suffix "-ness" (indicating a state or quality) to "invaluable," which itself is formed from "in-" (not) + "valuable" (having value).

词源:

* **valuable:**  From Old French *valable* (worthwhile, valuable), from Latin *valēre* (to be strong, be worth).
* **invaluable:**  The prefix "in-" adds the sense of "not" or "without," creating the antonym of valuable, meaning "too valuable to be measured."
* **invaluableness:**  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the abstract noun form, meaning "the state or quality of being invaluable."
* **invaluablenesses:** The plural form indicates multiple instances of invaluableness.


用法说明：

由于"invaluablenesses"是一个极少使用的词，几乎没有标准的语法例句。它的用法与"invaluableness"类似，但强调的是多种无价之宝或多种极其宝贵的事物。

例句：

The museum boasted a collection of invaluablenesses, from ancient artifacts to priceless paintings.  博物馆拥有无数的无价之宝，从古代文物到无价的绘画。
