词源:
The word "connection" comes from the Old French word "connexioun," which itself derives from the Latin word "connexio," meaning "a binding together" or "a joining."  The Latin word is formed from the verb "connectere," meaning "to bind together" or "to link."  This verb is a combination of "con-" (together) and "nectere" (to bind).
