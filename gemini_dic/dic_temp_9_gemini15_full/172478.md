词源:

The word "pyramidal" derives from the noun "pyramid," which itself comes from the Late Latin word "pyramis," ultimately originating from the Greek word "πυραμίς" (pyramís).  The Greek word's etymology is uncertain, but it is likely related to the Greek word "πῦρ" (pŷr), meaning "fire," possibly referencing the flame-like shape of a pyramid.
