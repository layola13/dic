词源:  The word "navel" comes from the Old French word "navle," which in turn derives from the Latin word "umbilicus."  "Umbilicus" literally means "little navel" and is related to the Latin word "umbo," meaning "boss" or "projection," referring to the central point of a shield or other round object.


用法说明:

navel通常用作名词，指人体腹部中央的脐部。  它很少用在其他语境中。  由于其解剖学上的含义，它在文学作品中也可能被用作隐喻，象征着起源、中心或连接点。
