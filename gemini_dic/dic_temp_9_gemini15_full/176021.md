词源:
The word "rave" ultimately derives from the Old French word "raver," meaning "to rave, be delirious, be mad."  This, in turn, is related to the Old Norse word "refsa," meaning "to scold, rebuke," suggesting an earlier sense of uncontrolled and agitated speech.  The modern sense of a lively party developed later.
