词源:

The word "sarcasticness" is derived from the adjective "sarcastic," which in turn originates from the Greek word "sarkazein" (σαρκάζειν), meaning "to tear flesh," or figuratively, "to speak bitterly."  The "-ness" suffix is a common English nominalizing suffix, turning an adjective into a noun.  Thus, "sarcasticness" denotes the quality or state of being sarcastic.


用法说明:

Sarcasticness is a noun referring to the quality or state of being sarcastic. It describes the act or manner of expressing oneself ironically or mockingly, often with the intention to wound or insult.  It focuses on the overall tone and attitude rather than a single sarcastic remark.

注意:  While "sarcasm" is also a noun, "sarcasticness" emphasizes the *quality* or *degree* of sarcasm present, making it a more nuanced word choice in certain contexts.
