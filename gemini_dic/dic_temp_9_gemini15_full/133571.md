词源:

The word "nonflagrancy" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "flagrancy."  "Flagrancy" derives from the French word "flagrant," meaning "burning," "obvious," or "noticeable," ultimately stemming from the Latin "flagrantem," the present participle of "flagro," meaning "to burn."  Therefore, "nonflagrancy" literally means "not burning" or "not obvious (in wrongdoing)."
