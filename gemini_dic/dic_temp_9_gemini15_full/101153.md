词源:
The word comes from the Latin "inveteratus," the past participle of "invetero," meaning "to make old," "to grow old," or "to become established."  The prefix "in-" here means "in" or "into," intensifying the meaning.  Therefore, "inveterately" suggests something that has become deeply rooted or ingrained over time.
