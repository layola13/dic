词源:
The word "catchline" combines "catch," meaning to attract or capture attention, and "line," referring to a phrase or sentence.  Its origins trace back to the late 19th century, emerging from the world of advertising and promotion.  The concept of a short, memorable phrase to promote a product or idea is an older concept but the word itself is relatively recent.
