The word "chabuk" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a word from another language, possibly Persian or Urdu.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and English usage explanation are not possible without knowing its origin.  To provide the requested analysis, I need more context. Please specify the language from which "chabuk" originates.
