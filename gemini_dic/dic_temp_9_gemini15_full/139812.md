词源:

The word "octocoral" is a modern scientific term combining "octo-" (from Latin *octo, meaning "eight") referring to the eight tentacles of each polyp, and "coral", derived from the Italian word "corallo", ultimately of Greek origin.  The Greek origin is somewhat uncertain, but possibly related to words denoting hardness or stone.
