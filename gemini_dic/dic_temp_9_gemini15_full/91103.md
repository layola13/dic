The word "hyads" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word? Perhaps "hyades" (a star cluster)?  If so, please provide the correct spelling.

2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name, place, or brand name not widely known.  More context is needed.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:**  It could be a newly coined word or slang term used within a specific community or context.  Again, more information is required.


Without knowing the intended word, I cannot provide the requested analysis including pronunciation, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical examples.  Please clarify the word or provide more context.
