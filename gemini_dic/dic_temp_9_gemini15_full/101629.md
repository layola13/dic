词源:
The word "irredeemablenesses" is derived from:

* **Irredeemable:**  This word is formed from the prefix "ir-" (meaning "not") + "redeemable" (capable of being redeemed or rescued from a bad situation).

* **Redeemable:** This comes from "redeem," which has Old English roots related to "buy back" or "ransom."

* **-ness:** This suffix turns an adjective (irredeemable) into a noun, indicating a state, quality, or condition.

* **-es:** This is the plural suffix for nouns.


Therefore, "irredeemablenesses" literally means "the plural states or qualities of being unredeemable."
