英文解析：The term "semi-documentary" describes a film, television program, or other media that combines elements of both documentary and fictional storytelling.  It uses real-life settings, events, or characters, but also incorporates fictionalized narratives, dramatic reenactments, or invented dialogue to enhance the story or create a more engaging viewing experience. The line between fact and fiction is blurred, and the audience is often left to discern the truth from the dramatization.


例句：

The film, while presented as a semi-documentary, takes considerable creative liberties with historical events. 这部电影虽然以半纪录片的形式呈现，但却对历史事件进行了大量的艺术加工。


The director used a semi-documentary approach, interweaving interviews with actors portraying historical figures. 导演采用了半纪录片手法，将采访与扮演历史人物的演员的表演交织在一起。


词源：

The word is a compound of "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partly") and "documentary" (referring to a film or program based on factual events).  The term emerged as a way to describe films that didn't fit neatly into either the purely fictional or purely factual categories.
