ribos:/ˈraɪbəʊz/| n. |核糖体|Ribosomes are complex molecular machines found within all living cells, responsible for protein synthesis. They are composed of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and proteins, and they translate the genetic code from messenger RNA (mRNA) into a polypeptide chain, which then folds into a functional protein.| Example:  Ribosomes are essential for cell growth and function.|近义词：protein synthesis machinery|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Ribosomes synthesize proteins continuously. = 核糖体持续合成蛋白质。
The ribosomes translate mRNA into proteins. = 核糖体将信使RNA翻译成蛋白质。


一般过去时:
The ribosomes translated the mRNA quickly. = 核糖体快速翻译了信使RNA。
Scientists studied the ribosomes' structure. = 科学家研究了核糖体的结构。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered many ribosome functions. = 科学家已经发现了许多核糖体的功能。
Researchers have identified several types of ribosomes. = 研究人员已经鉴定了几种类型的核糖体。


过去完成时:
The cell had already produced proteins before the drug was administered. = 在施药之前，细胞已经产生了蛋白质。
The ribosomes had completed protein synthesis before the signal was received. = 在收到信号之前，核糖体已经完成了蛋白质合成。


将来时:
Researchers will study the ribosomes' role in disease. = 研究人员将研究核糖体在疾病中的作用。
Scientists will develop new drugs that target ribosomes. = 科学家将开发靶向核糖体的新药。


虚拟语气:
If the ribosomes were damaged, protein synthesis would stop. = 如果核糖体受损，蛋白质合成就会停止。
It is essential that the ribosomes function correctly. = 核糖体必须正常工作。


被动语态:
Proteins are synthesized by ribosomes. = 蛋白质由核糖体合成。
The mRNA is translated by ribosomes. = 信使RNA由核糖体翻译。


疑问句:
Where are the ribosomes located in the cell? = 核糖体位于细胞的哪个部位？
How many ribosomes are in a typical cell? = 一个典型的细胞中有多少核糖体？


否定句:
Ribosomes do not function without mRNA. = 没有信使RNA，核糖体就不能发挥作用。
The cells did not produce enough proteins. = 细胞没有产生足够的蛋白质。


PHRASE->
ribosomal RNA (rRNA) = 核糖体RNA
ribosome binding site (RBS) = 核糖体结合位点
protein synthesis = 蛋白质合成
eukaryotic ribosomes = 真核生物核糖体
prokaryotic ribosomes = 原核生物核糖体
