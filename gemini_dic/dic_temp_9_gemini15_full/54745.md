词源:

The word "disparity" comes from the Old French word "disparité," which itself derives from the Latin word "disparitas."  "Disparitas" is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart" or "not") and "paritas" (meaning "equality"). Therefore, the root meaning points to a lack of equality or a state of being unequal.
