词源:  The term derives from the observation that pigeons often stand with their toes turned inward.  The word "pigeon" comes from the Old French *pigeon*, ultimately from Latin *pipio* ("a young pigeon," onomatopoeic for its chirping sound). The suffix "-toed" simply indicates the characteristic foot posture.
