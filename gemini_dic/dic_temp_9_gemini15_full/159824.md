polygroup:/ˈpɒliɡruːp/| n. |多群，多重群|A polygroup is a generalization of a group in which the operation is not necessarily binary (i.e., it may involve more than two elements at a time).  It's a structure with multiple operations that satisfy certain axioms, extending the concept of a group beyond the single binary operation.  The precise axioms vary depending on the specific definition being used, but generally involve associativity and the existence of identities and inverses under these multiple operations. | Example: The study of polygroups is a complex area within abstract algebra, exploring algebraic structures with more intricate operational properties than standard groups.  |近义词：hypergroup (in some contexts)|反义词：group (in the sense of being a simpler structure)

USAGE->
This word is primarily used in abstract algebra and does not have common usage in everyday language or simple grammatical structures. Therefore, providing examples for tenses and other grammatical structures is not relevant or possible in the same way as for a common word like "what".  Polygroup is a highly specialized term.

PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases or collocations directly involving "polygroup" due to its highly specialized usage within a limited field of mathematics.
