pseudoseizure:/ˈsuːdoʊˌsiːʒər/| n. |假性癫痫发作|A pseudoseizure is a seizure-like episode that has a psychological, rather than neurological, origin.  These episodes mimic the symptoms of a true epileptic seizure, but they are caused by underlying psychological factors such as stress, trauma, or anxiety.  They can manifest in a variety of ways, including convulsive movements, loss of consciousness, and altered mental status. However, unlike true seizures, pseudoseizures do not involve abnormal electrical activity in the brain.|Example: The doctor determined that the patient's episode was a pseudoseizure, not a true epileptic seizure, after conducting a thorough neurological examination and EEG.|近义词:psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (PNES), conversion disorder|反义词:epileptic seizure
