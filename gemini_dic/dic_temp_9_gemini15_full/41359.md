词源:
The word "cork-like" is a compound adjective. It combines the noun "cork" (referring to the bark of the cork oak tree) with the suffix "-like," indicating resemblance.  The word "cork" itself originates from the Old English word "corc," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "cortex," meaning "bark."
