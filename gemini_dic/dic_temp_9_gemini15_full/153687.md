词源:
The word "people" comes from the Old English word "folc," meaning "people, nation, tribe."  Over time, the word evolved through Middle English forms before settling into its current form.  The plural form, though seemingly irregular, is a remnant of older grammatical structures where the plural was marked differently than in modern English.
