词源:
The word "manlihood" is a compound word derived from the Old English words "mann" (man) and "līċ" (body, form, likeness).  Over time, "-hood" evolved as a suffix denoting state or condition, resulting in "manlihood" signifying "the state or quality of being a man."  The modern understanding incorporates traditional masculine attributes beyond just physical form.
