词源:choir + master.  "Choir" comes from the Old French *quire, ultimately from the Latin *chorus, meaning "dance," "band," or "crowd."  "Master" is from Old English *maestre, from Old French *maistre, ultimately from the Latin *magister, meaning "teacher" or "craftsman."  Therefore, "choirmaster" literally means "master of the choir."
