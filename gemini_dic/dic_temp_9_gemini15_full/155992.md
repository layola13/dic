photoheterotrophically:/ˌfoʊtoʊˌhɛtərəʊˈtrɒfɪkli/| adv. |光合异养地|  Describes an organism that obtains energy from light and carbon from organic compounds.  This is a metabolic process where an organism uses light as an energy source but relies on organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a carbon source. | Example:  Some bacteria grow photoheterotrophically, using sunlight for energy and organic molecules for carbon.  一些细菌通过光合异养的方式生长，利用阳光获取能量，利用有机分子获取碳。 | 近义词: photoorganotrophically | 反义词: autotrophically, chemoautotrophically


USAGE->
This word is an adverb, and its usage follows standard adverbial patterns in English sentences.  It modifies verbs, describing how an action is performed.  Therefore, tense, voice and mood variations affect the sentence structure but not the word itself.
