词源：

The word "defiance" comes from the Old French word "defiance," meaning "a challenge," which in turn derives from the verb "defier," meaning "to challenge," "to defy."  The ultimate origin is the Latin prefix "de-" (away, from) and "fidere" (to trust), implying a lack of trust or faith in authority.
