词源:

The word "implanting" comes from the verb "implant," which itself is formed from the prefix "im-" (meaning "in" or "into") and the verb "plant."  The original meaning of "plant" referred to putting something into the ground to grow,  and this sense extended to the figurative meaning of establishing something firmly.  Therefore, "implant" means to fix something firmly in place, both literally and figuratively.
