词源:
The word "confidant" comes from the French word "confident," meaning "one who is trusted."  This, in turn, is derived from the Latin word "confidere," meaning "to trust." The "-ant" suffix indicates an agent or doer of the action.  Therefore, a confidant is someone in whom confidence is placed.
