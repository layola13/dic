rhabdite:/ˈræbdaɪt/| n. |杆状体，梭状体 |A minute, rod-shaped inclusion found in the epidermis of some invertebrates, especially turbellarian flatworms.  They are secreted by specialized gland cells and are thought to play a role in defense or locomotion. |Example: The microscopic examination revealed numerous rhabdoids in the epidermis of the flatworm.  显微镜检查显示涡虫表皮中存在许多杆状体。|近义词：rod,  bacilliform body |反义词：N/A


USAGE->

过去完成时:
They had already studied rhabdoids before the conference. = 他们在会议之前就已经研究过杆状体了。
Scientists had hypothesized about the function of rhabdoids for decades. = 科学家们几十年来一直在假设杆状体的功能。


将来时:
We will analyze the rhabdoids using advanced techniques. = 我们将使用先进的技术分析杆状体。
Researchers will further investigate the role of rhabdoids. = 研究人员将进一步研究杆状体的作用。


虚拟语气:
If the rhabdoids were absent, the organism would be more vulnerable. = 如果没有杆状体，生物体将更容易受到攻击。

疑问句:
What is the exact function of rhabdoids? = 杆状体的确切功能是什么？
How are rhabdoids produced by the organism? = 机体是如何产生杆状体的？


否定句:
The sample did not contain any visible rhabdoids. = 样本中没有任何可见的杆状体。
This species does not possess rhabdoids in its epidermis. = 这个物种的表皮中没有杆状体。


PHRASE->
rhabdoid morphology = 杆状体形态
rhabdoid formation = 杆状体形成
rhabdoid secretion = 杆状体分泌
rhabdoid structure = 杆状体结构
rhabdoid function = 杆状体功能
