overmitigating: /ˌoʊvərˈmɪtɪɡeɪtɪŋ/ | v. | 过度减轻；过度缓解 |  The act of excessively reducing or mitigating something, often to the point of causing a new problem or imbalance.  This is not a standard dictionary word; it's a newly coined word formed by combining "over-" (excessively) and "mitigating" (reducing the severity of something).  Therefore, there are no standard examples, synonyms, or antonyms widely accepted.  Its meaning is derived from its component parts.
