protobiont:/ˈproʊtoʊbaɪˌɑːnt/| n. | 原生体，前细胞 | A protobiont is a self-organized, endogenously ordered, spherical collection of lipids proposed as a precursor to early prokaryotic cells.  Protobionts are not considered to be truly alive, as they lack the genetic material and complex machinery of living cells, but they exhibit some properties of life, such as the ability to maintain an internal environment different from their surroundings. | Example:  Scientists hypothesize that protobionts may have formed spontaneously in early Earth's oceans, providing a stepping stone to the evolution of life.  科学家假设原生体可能在早期地球的海洋中自发形成，为生命的进化提供了垫脚石。| 近义词：precursor, protocell | 反义词：cell (in the sense of a fully functioning living cell)
