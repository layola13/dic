catelectrotonic: /ˌkætˌɛləktrəˈtɒnɪk/ | adj. | 负电紧张的；阴极电紧张的 | Relating to or denoting the decrease in excitability of a nerve or muscle fiber that occurs near the cathode during the passage of a direct current.  This decrease in excitability is caused by hyperpolarization of the cell membrane. | The catelectrotonic potential was measured using a microelectrode.  负电紧张电位是用微电极测量的。 |  近义词: hyperpolarized | 反义词: anelectrotonic


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a scientific context, specifically within the field of neurophysiology.  Therefore, illustrating its usage through typical grammatical tenses is less relevant than providing examples within its field of study.


Example 1 (Passive Voice):
The nerve fiber's excitability was found to be significantly reduced in the catelectrotonic region. 神经纤维的兴奋性在负电紧张区域被发现显著降低。


Example 2 (Active Voice):
Direct current application induced a catelectrotonic effect, decreasing the nerve's responsiveness to stimuli. 直流电的施加诱导了负电紧张效应，降低了神经对刺激的反应性。


Example 3 (Simple Present):
Catelectrotonic polarization alters the membrane potential. 负电紧张极化改变膜电位。


Example 4 (Simple Past):
Researchers observed a clear catelectrotonic response after stimulation. 研究人员在刺激后观察到明显的负电紧张反应。
