USAGE->
This word is extremely rare and unlikely to be used in everyday conversation or writing. Its usage would be limited to highly specialized academic or technical contexts where discussing multiple instances of incompleteness is necessary.  Therefore, providing examples for various tenses and grammatical structures is impractical and would not reflect realistic usage.


PHRASE->
Given the rarity of the word,  phrase examples are not applicable.  The word itself is the phrase, referring to multiple instances of non-comprehensiveness.
