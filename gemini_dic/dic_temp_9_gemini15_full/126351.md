myriadth: /ˈmɪriəθ/ | adj. | 万分之一的；极微小的 |  The myriadth part of a large number represents an extremely small fraction.  It signifies an incredibly tiny portion or a number so small as to be practically insignificant.

词源:  Derived from "myriad" (from Greek "murias," meaning ten thousand), combined with the ordinal suffix "-th," indicating order or position in a sequence.  The original meaning of "myriad" has expanded to encompass a vast or countless number, leading to the "myriadth" representing an extremely small fraction within that vastness.
