prochirality:/ˌproʊkaɪˈrælɪti/| n. |前手性|The property of a molecule that lacks a chiral center but can be converted into a chiral molecule by a single alteration, such as replacing a hydrogen atom with a deuterium atom.  It describes a molecule that is achiral but has the potential to become chiral.  This potential arises from the presence of a prochiral center, typically a sp3 hybridized carbon atom with two identical substituents. Replacing one of these identical substituents with a different one creates a chiral center.| Example:  A methylene group (–CH2–) in a molecule is prochiral because replacing one of the hydrogen atoms with a different group creates a chiral center. |近义词:prostereoisomerism|反义词:chirality
