heterostyled:/ˈhɛtərəʊstaɪld/| adj.|异型花的；具有不同花柱的|Having flowers with different styles, referring to plants exhibiting heterostyly.  This variation in style length promotes cross-pollination by ensuring pollen transfer between different morphs.| Example:  Primroses are a classic example of a heterostyled species.|近义词：dimorphic (in the context of flower styles), distylous (if referring specifically to two style lengths)|反义词：homostyled (having flowers with styles of uniform length)


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The plant exhibits heterostyled flowers. =  这种植物展现出异型花。
This species is heterostyled. = 这个物种是异型花的。


一般过去时:
Researchers observed heterostyled flowers in the study. = 研究人员在研究中观察到异型花。
The botanist documented the heterostyled nature of the plant. = 植物学家记录了这种植物的异型花特性。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified many heterostyled species. = 科学家们已经鉴定了许多异型花物种。
Botanists have long studied the mechanisms of heterostyly. = 植物学家们长期以来一直在研究异型花的机制。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the heterostyled nature of the plant was unknown. = 在发现之前，这种植物的异型花特性是未知的。
They had already analyzed several heterostyled specimens. = 他们已经分析了几种异型花标本。


将来时:
We will investigate the genetic basis of heterostyly. = 我们将研究异型花的遗传基础。
Researchers will explore the evolutionary advantages of heterostyled flowers. = 研究人员将探索异型花的进化优势。


虚拟语气:
If the flowers were homostyled, cross-pollination would be less efficient. = 如果花是同型花的，异花授粉的效率就会降低。
I wish I had known about the plant's heterostyled nature earlier. = 我真希望早点知道这种植物的异型花特性。


被动语态:
Heterostyled flowers were observed in the field study. = 在田野研究中观察到异型花。
The evolutionary significance of heterostyly is being investigated. = 异型花的进化意义正在被研究。


疑问句:
Is this species heterostyled or homostyled? = 这个物种是异型花还是同型花？
Are the differences in style length crucial for heterostyly? = 花柱长度的差异对异型花至关重要吗？


否定句:
The plant is not heterostyled; its flowers are all similar. = 这种植物不是异型花的；它的花都相似。
This species does not exhibit the typical characteristics of heterostyly. = 这个物种没有表现出异型花的典型特征。


PHRASE->
heterostyled flowers = 异型花
degree of heterostyly = 异型花程度
mechanism of heterostyly = 异型花机制
evolution of heterostyly = 异型花的进化
genetic basis of heterostyly = 异型花的遗传基础
