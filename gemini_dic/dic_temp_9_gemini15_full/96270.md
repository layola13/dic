词源:
The word "indicter" comes from the verb "indict," which originates from the Old French word "enditer," meaning "to dictate, to write down, to compose."  The "in-" prefix is from Latin, and the "-ict" root relates to words like "dictate" and "dictum," all suggesting the formal presentation of a charge or statement.  The suffix "-er" denotes the agent or doer of the action.
