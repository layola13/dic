cosurfactants:/ˌkoʊsɜːrfæktənts/| n. |助表面活性剂|Substances that enhance the properties of surfactants, improving their effectiveness in various applications, such as reducing surface tension, improving emulsification, or enhancing foaming.|Cosurfactants are often used in formulations to improve the performance of primary surfactants.  For example, in cosmetic products, they might enhance the texture or stability of the emulsion.|近义词：secondary surfactants, surfactant modifiers|反义词：None specifically, but substances that *counteract* surfactant effects could be considered antonyms in a functional sense.
