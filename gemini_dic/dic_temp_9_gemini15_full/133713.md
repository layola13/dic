词源:
The word "nonfrivolous" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "frivolous" (meaning "lacking seriousness; flippant").  Therefore, "nonfrivolous" directly means "not frivolous".  The root of "frivolous" ultimately derives from the Latin word "frivolus," meaning "empty, trifling."
