词源:
The word "incur" comes from Old French "encourir," which is composed of the prefix "en-" (meaning "in" or "into") and the verb "courir" (meaning "to run").  The original meaning implied "to run into" something, often something undesirable.  This evolved into the modern meaning of bringing something upon oneself.
