词源:
The word "oysterous" is derived from "oyster," which was originally associated with loud, boisterous behavior, possibly due to the sounds associated with opening oysters.  The connection is somewhat obscure and likely based on onomatopoeia or a metaphorical association of the difficulty of opening an oyster with the difficulty of controlling a noisy crowd.  The word is now largely archaic or humorous, with "boisterous" being a more common and accepted synonym.
