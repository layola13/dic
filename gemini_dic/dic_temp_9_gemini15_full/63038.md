词源：

The word "enrapturing" is derived from the verb "enrapture," which itself comes from the Old French "enravir," meaning "to snatch away," "to ravish," or "to delight intensely."  The prefix "en-" intensifies the meaning, while the root relates to the idea of being completely captivated or swept away by something. The "-ing" suffix transforms the verb into a present participle, functioning as an adjective.
