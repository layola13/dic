词源:
The word "nonvolatilities" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), "volatility" (referring to the tendency to change rapidly or unpredictably), and the plural suffix "-ities".  "Volatility" itself comes from the Latin word "volatilis," meaning "flying" or "easily evaporated".  Therefore, "nonvolatilities" literally means "the qualities of not being easily evaporated or changed."
