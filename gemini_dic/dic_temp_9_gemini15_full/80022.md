词源:
The phrasal verb "go through" is composed of the verb "go" and the preposition "through."  "Go" has its roots in Old English "gān," meaning "to go," and "through" comes from Old English "þurh," also meaning "through." The combined meaning evolved over time to encompass the various senses detailed above.
