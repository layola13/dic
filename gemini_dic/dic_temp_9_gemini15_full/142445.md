oscillator:/ˈɒsɪleɪtə(r)/|/ˈɑːsɪleɪtər/| n. |振荡器；振子 |A device or circuit that produces a repetitive, oscillating signal, typically a sine wave or square wave.  Oscillators are fundamental components in many electronic devices, used for timing, generating signals, and frequency control. |Example:  The quartz crystal in your watch acts as an oscillator, maintaining accurate timekeeping.  石英手表中的石英晶体充当振荡器，保持精确的计时。

The heart is a biological oscillator, rhythmically pumping blood throughout the body. 心脏是一个生物振荡器，有节奏地将血液泵送到全身。|近义词：vibrator, generator, resonator |反义词：stabilizer, damper
