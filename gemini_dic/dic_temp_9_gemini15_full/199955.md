The word primarily reflects a historical context and is rarely used in modern English. It suggests a less formal or committed relationship than marriage. |  Example: They were skainsmate for many years before finally getting married. 他们同居多年后才最终结婚。 |  近义词: partner, companion, cohabitant | 反义词: spouse (if implying a lack of marriage)


USAGE->
This word is archaic and rarely used; therefore, grammatical examples are not applicable in standard modern English usage.  The word itself doesn't lend itself to typical tense conjugations like a regular verb.  Its use would be confined to describing a state of cohabitation.


PHRASE->
The word "skainsmate" itself functions as a single, complete noun and does not typically appear in common phrases.
