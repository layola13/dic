词源:
The word "disperse" comes from the Old French word "disperser," which itself is derived from the Latin word "dispersus," the past participle of "dispersare."  "Dispersare" is a compound of the prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart" or "away") and "spargere" (meaning "to scatter" or "to sow").  Therefore, the word's roots indicate the act of scattering or spreading things apart.
