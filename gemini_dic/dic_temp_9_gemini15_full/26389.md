词源:  The word "by-product" is a compound word. "By" here means "near" or "beside," indicating something that comes alongside the main product. "Product" refers to something produced or manufactured.  Therefore, a by-product is something produced alongside or as a consequence of the main production process.  The term emerged in the 19th century as industrial processes became more complex and generated more secondary substances.
