词源:
The word "inacquiescent" is formed by adding the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "acquiescent," which comes from the verb "acquiesce" (to accept something reluctantly but without protest).  Ultimately, "acquiesce" traces back to the Latin word "acquiescere," meaning "to rest in," "to be at rest," or "to agree."  The "in-" prefix reverses the meaning, creating a word signifying a lack of agreement or acceptance.
