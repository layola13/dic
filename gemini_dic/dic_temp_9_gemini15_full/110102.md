词源:

The word "lickerish" ultimately derives from the Old English word "licor," meaning "liquid" or "drink."  Over time, its meaning shifted, influenced by the Middle English "licourous," which described someone fond of sweet drinks. This then evolved into "lickerish," broadening its connotation to include a general fondness for sweet things and later, extending to a more lascivious sense.  The connection to "lick" suggests a fondness for tasting and consuming.
