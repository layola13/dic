saltation:/sælˈteɪʃən/| n. |跳跃；突变；飞跃|The sudden and significant change in a species' characteristics, typically resulting from a mutation.  It refers to a large-scale evolutionary change that occurs suddenly, rather than through gradual processes. This can be seen in the fossil record as an abrupt appearance of a new species.|Example: The saltation theory suggests that evolution can occur through sudden, large jumps rather than gradual changes.|近义词：leap, jump, mutation, discontinuity|反义词：gradualism, continuity|
