pseudogley:/ˈsuːdəʊɡleɪ/| n. |假潜育土|A soil that shows characteristics similar to gley soils (soils that are waterlogged for extended periods), but these characteristics are not caused by permanent waterlogging. Instead, they are often caused by temporary waterlogging or impeded drainage due to other factors, such as a high water table that fluctuates seasonally or a compacted subsoil layer.  Pseudogleys often have mottled patterns of colors indicating both reduced and oxidized iron, but the mottling is less intense and less consistently distributed than in true gley soils.  The soil's properties may change seasonally, reflecting the fluctuation of the water table. | The field showed signs of pseudogley, with mottled coloration suggesting occasional waterlogging, but not permanent saturation.  这块田地显示出假潜育土的迹象，斑驳的色彩表明偶尔有积水，但不是永久性饱和。|gley soil, gleysol | well-drained soil |n.
