drumlinoid:/ˈdrʌmlɪnɔɪd/| n. |鼓丘状地形|A drumlinoid is a landform resembling a drumlin but differing in some significant aspect, such as size, shape, or origin.  Unlike typical drumlins which are streamlined, elongated hills formed by glacial action, drumlinoids can be formed by other processes, including fluvial processes or even tectonic activity.  The exact criteria for classifying a landform as a drumlinoid rather than a drumlin are often debated. |The researchers identified several drumlinoid features in the valley. 研究人员在山谷中发现了几个鼓丘状地形特征。The geological survey revealed a field of drumlinoids in the previously unexplored region.  地质勘测显示，在以前未勘探的地区存在一片鼓丘状地形。|近义词：drumlin-like, elongated hill |反义词：N/A
