WORD ORIGIN->
The word "non-syntactic" is a combination of:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of".
* **syntactic**:  Derived from "syntax," which comes from the Greek word " σύνταξις" (sýntaxis), meaning "arrangement," "order," or "putting together."  In linguistics, syntax refers to the rules governing the arrangement of words in a sentence.


Therefore, "non-syntactic" literally means "not according to the rules of arrangement of words in a sentence."
