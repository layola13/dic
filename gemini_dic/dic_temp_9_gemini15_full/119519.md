词源:
The word "microprocessor" is a compound word formed from "micro-" (meaning small) and "processor" (a device that processes information).  The "micro-" prefix emphasizes the small size of the integrated circuit containing the CPU.  The term emerged in the early days of integrated circuit technology, reflecting the miniaturization of the central processing unit.
