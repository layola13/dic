词源:

The word "reciprocal" comes from the Late Latin word *reciprocus*, meaning "returning," "alternate," or "mutual." This, in turn, derives from the Latin prefix *re-* ("back, again") and *pro* ("forward").  The verb "reciprocate" and the noun "reciprocity" are later derivations from the adjective.
