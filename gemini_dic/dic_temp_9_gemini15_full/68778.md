词源:
The word "farsighted" comes from the combination of "far" (meaning distant) and "sighted" (related to sight).  The "sighted" part ultimately derives from the Old English word "sihþ," meaning "sight." The combination signifies the ability to see things that are far away, both literally and figuratively.
