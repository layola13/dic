milliosmole:/ˈmɪliˌɒzmoʊl/|/ˈmɪliˌɑːzmoʊl/| n. |毫渗透摩尔|A milliosmole (mOsm) is a unit of measurement of the osmotic concentration of a solution. It represents one-thousandth of an osmole (Osm).  Osmotic concentration refers to the number of solute particles that exert an osmotic pressure.  A higher milliosmole value indicates a higher osmotic pressure.  This is important in various fields, including medicine and biology, as osmotic pressure influences the movement of water across cell membranes.|Example: The intravenous solution has a milliosmolality of 300 mOsm/kg.  静脉注射液的毫渗透摩尔浓度为 300 mOsm/kg.|近义词：milliosmolar|反义词：无直接反义词，但可以与低渗溶液（hypotonic solution）的概念相对比。
