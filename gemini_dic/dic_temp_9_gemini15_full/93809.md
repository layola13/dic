词源:
The word "immethodical" is formed from the prefix "im-" (meaning "not") and the word "methodical," which itself derives from "method" (a system or plan of action) and the suffix "-ical" (meaning "relating to").  Therefore, "immethodical" literally means "not relating to a method" or "lacking a method."
