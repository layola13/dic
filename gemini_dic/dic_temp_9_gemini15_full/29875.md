The word "causeyed" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  To provide the analysis, I would need a correctly spelled word or more context about its intended meaning.
