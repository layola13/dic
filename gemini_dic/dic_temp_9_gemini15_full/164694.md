preextensively:/ˌpriːɪkˈstɛnsɪvli/| adv.|预先广泛地，事先广泛地|The term "preextensively" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a combination of "pre-" (meaning before) and "extensively" (meaning widely or thoroughly).  Therefore, its meaning can be inferred as "beforehand in a wide or thorough manner" or "widely and thoroughly in advance." However,  its usage is highly unusual and should be avoided in formal writing. |例句：This research project was preextensively planned, ensuring minimal unforeseen issues. (这个研究项目事先进行了广泛的规划，确保尽量减少不可预见的问题。)  |近义词：thoroughly beforehand, comprehensively in advance, extensively beforehand |反义词：superficially afterward, minimally in advance|副词
