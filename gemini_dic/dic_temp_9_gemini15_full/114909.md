词源:
The word "manacle" comes from the Old French word "manacle," which itself derives from the Late Latin word "maniculae," a diminutive of "manus," meaning "hand."  The original meaning was specifically a hand restraint.  Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass any form of restriction or confinement.
