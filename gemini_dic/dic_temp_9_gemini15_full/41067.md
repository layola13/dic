词源:
The verb "cop" in this context originates from slang, meaning "to get" or "to receive".  The phrase "copped out" implies receiving the easy way out, avoiding a difficult task or responsibility.  While the precise origin is difficult to pinpoint, its use as a slang term to describe avoiding responsibility solidified in the mid-20th century.
