词源:
The word "sidewalk" is a compound word, combining "side" and "walk."  "Side" refers to the edge or margin, and "walk" refers to the act of walking or a path for walking.  Its usage evolved from a simple descriptive term to a specific term for a pedestrian pathway alongside a road.  The term first appeared in the late 18th century in American English.
