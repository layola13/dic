The word "confervous" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a blend or a newly coined word, possibly a portmanteau of "confident" and "nervous."  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested are impossible.  To provide a response in the requested format would be misleading.
