microaerophilic:/ˌmaɪkroʊˈɛrəfɪlɪk/| adj.|微需氧的|Requiring only small amounts of oxygen for growth; organisms that thrive in environments with low oxygen levels.  These organisms cannot tolerate high oxygen concentrations, which can be toxic to them.|Example:  Many Helicobacter pylori strains are microaerophilic, requiring a reduced oxygen atmosphere for optimal growth.|近义词：anaerobic (partially), oxygen-sensitive|反义词：aerobic


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The bacteria grow best in microaerophilic conditions. = 这种细菌在微需氧条件下生长最好。
This organism exhibits microaerophilic characteristics. =  这种生物体表现出微需氧特性。


一般过去时:
The experiment showed that the culture was microaerophilic. = 实验表明培养物是微需氧的。
Scientists discovered that the bacteria were microaerophilic. = 科学家发现这种细菌是微需氧的。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several microaerophilic species. = 研究人员已经鉴定出几种微需氧物种。
We have determined that the pathogen is microaerophilic. = 我们已经确定这种病原体是微需氧的。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had suspected the organism was microaerophilic. = 在实验之前，他们怀疑这种生物是微需氧的。
It had been previously established that this bacterium was microaerophilic. = 此前已确定这种细菌是微需氧的。


将来时:
Future research will focus on understanding microaerophilic metabolism. = 未来的研究将集中在了解微需氧代谢方面。
Scientists will investigate the unique adaptations of microaerophilic bacteria. = 科学家将研究微需氧细菌的独特适应性。


虚拟语气:
If the culture were microaerophilic, it would grow poorly in air. = 如果培养物是微需氧的，它在空气中生长不良。
It would be helpful if we knew whether the organism is strictly microaerophilic. = 如果我们知道这种生物是否是严格的微需氧生物，那将会有帮助。


被动语态:
The microaerophilic nature of the bacteria was confirmed by the experiment. = 细菌的微需氧特性通过实验得到了证实。
Several new microaerophilic species have recently been discovered. = 最近发现了几种新的微需氧物种。


疑问句:
Is this bacterium microaerophilic or anaerobic? = 这种细菌是微需氧的还是厌氧的？
Are the conditions suitable for microaerophilic growth? = 条件是否适合微需氧生长？


否定句:
The fungus is not microaerophilic; it requires high oxygen levels. = 这种真菌不是微需氧的；它需要高氧水平。
These bacteria are not strictly microaerophilic; they can tolerate some oxygen. = 这些细菌不是严格的微需氧的；它们可以耐受一些氧气。


PHRASE->
microaerophilic bacteria = 微需氧细菌
microaerophilic conditions = 微需氧条件
