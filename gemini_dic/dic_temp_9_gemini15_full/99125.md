词源:

* **inter-**:  Latin prefix meaning "between" or "among"
* **cellul-**: From Latin "cellula," a small room, diminutive of "cella," a cell, small room.
* **-ar**:  Adjectival suffix indicating "relating to" or "pertaining to".

Therefore, "intercellular" literally means "relating to the space or area between cells."
