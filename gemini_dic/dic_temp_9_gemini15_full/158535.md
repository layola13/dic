pleonastical:/ˌpliːəˈnæstɪkəl/| adj.|累赘的；多余的；冗余的 | Characterized by the use of more words than are needed to express an idea; redundant.  It often involves using words that essentially repeat the same meaning. For example, "a burning fire" is pleonastic because "fire" implies burning. | The sentence "He advanced forward" is pleonastic because "advanced" already implies forward movement. | 近义词：redundant, superfluous, tautological | 反义词：concise, succinct

例句：

The phrase "completely finished" is pleonastic; "finished" already implies completeness.  =短语“完全完成”是多余的；“完成”本身就意味着完整。


His writing style is often criticized for being pleonastic, filled with unnecessary adjectives and adverbs. =他的写作风格经常因为冗长累赘而受到批评，充满了不必要的形容词和副词。
