词源:
The word "enthral" comes from the Old English "inþrælan," which means "to enslave."  The "in-" prefix means "in" or "into," and "þrælan" is related to the word "thrall," meaning "slave" or "bondage."  Over time, the meaning shifted from physical enslavement to a figurative enslavement of the mind and attention, hence the modern meaning of being captivated or fascinated.
