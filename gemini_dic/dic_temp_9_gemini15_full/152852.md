词源:

From Late Latin *paedagogus, from Greek paidagogos, literally "child-leader," from pais "child" + agogos "leader".  The original meaning referred to a slave who was responsible for the care and education of a child.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass any teacher, often with the negative connotations mentioned above.
