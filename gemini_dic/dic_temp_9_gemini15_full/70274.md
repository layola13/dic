词源:
The word "fiddlestick" originally referred to the bow used for playing a fiddle (violin). Its use as an expression of disbelief or dismissal likely arose from the idea of something being trivial or insignificant, like a fiddlestick compared to a more substantial object or argument.  The transition from the literal meaning to the figurative use is a form of metonymy.
