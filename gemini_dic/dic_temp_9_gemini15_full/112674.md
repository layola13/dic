* **lowest:**  Old English *lēosta*, superlative of *lēoht* "light, little".  It indicates the smallest or least among a group.

* **common:** From Old French *comun*, from Latin *communis* "common, shared".  It signifies something shared or held in common.

* **denominator:** From Latin *denominatōr*, from *dēnōmināre* "to name, designate". In mathematics, it's the number below the line in a fraction, indicating the number of equal parts into which a whole is divided.


The phrase "lowest common denominator" in its mathematical sense emerged from the need to find the smallest common multiple for adding or subtracting fractions. Its figurative use developed later, reflecting the idea of finding the simplest, most widely understood element in a diverse group.
