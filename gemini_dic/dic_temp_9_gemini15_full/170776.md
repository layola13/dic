词源:
pseudo- (from Greek *pseudes*, meaning "false" or "lying") + courteously (from courtly, meaning "polite" or "refined," ultimately from the Old French *curteis*).  The word combines the prefix "pseudo" indicating falseness with "courteously" signifying politeness, resulting in a word describing a politeness that is insincere or feigned.
