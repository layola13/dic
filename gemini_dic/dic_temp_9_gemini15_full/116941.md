词源:  The word "mazed" originates from the Old English word "mæse," meaning "a maze" or "labyrinth."  Over time, the meaning shifted to describe the state of being lost or confused, as one might be in a maze.  The -ed suffix indicates the past participle or adjectival form.


用法说明：

Mazed is primarily used as an adjective to describe a person's state of mind or the effect something has on a person.  It implies a feeling of disorientation, confusion, or wonder, often caused by something unexpected or overwhelming.
