词源:

The word "hero-worshiped" is a compound word formed from "hero" and "worshiped".

* **Hero:**  Originating from the Ancient Greek word "hērōs," meaning "protector," "champion," or "demi-god." It evolved to describe a person of extraordinary courage, strength, or ability.

* **Worshiped:**  Derived from the Old English word "weorþscipe," meaning "worth," "honor," or "dignity."  It's related to the verb "worship," signifying reverence, adoration, or devotion. The "-ed" suffix indicates the past participle form, often used adjectivally.
