词源:

The word "disposals" comes from the verb "dispose," which originates from the Old French word "disposer," meaning "to arrange, set in order, prepare."  The prefix "dis-" implies removal or getting rid of something.  Therefore, "disposals" refers to the act of getting rid of something, often waste materials.
