USAGE->

This word is primarily a legal term and doesn't have common usage in everyday conversation.  Therefore, demonstrating tenses etc. is not practical.  Instead, here are examples illustrating different contexts where postliminium might be applied:

Example 1 (International Law):  The application of postliminium to occupied territories after liberation raised complex legal questions regarding property ownership and sovereignty. 战后对被占领土实施事后恢复引发了关于财产所有权和主权的复杂法律问题。

Example 2 (Historical Context):  The concept of postliminium was crucial in Roman law, allowing citizens returning from enemy territory to reclaim their former positions and assets. 事后恢复的概念在罗马法中至关重要，它允许从敌方领土返回的公民收回其以前的地位和资产。

Example 3 (Hypothetical): If postliminium were to apply in this case, the wrongfully imprisoned individual would regain their job and pension. 如果在此案中适用事后恢复，被冤枉监禁的个人将恢复其工作和养老金。


PHRASE->

Because "postliminium" is a single, rarely used word, phrase examples aren't applicable.
