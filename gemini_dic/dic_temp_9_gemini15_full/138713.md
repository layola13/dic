nullipore:/ˈnʌlɪpɔːr/| n. |珊瑚藻；無孔珊瑚藻|A type of red algae that secretes calcium carbonate, forming a hard, crust-like structure.  Nullipores are important components of many marine ecosystems, particularly in coral reefs. They are often mistaken for corals.|Example: The divers observed a vibrant reef teeming with colorful fish and extensive nullipore beds.|近义词：coralline algae, calcareous algae|反义词：None specifically, but terms indicating soft algae or non-calcium-secreting algae could be considered opposites.|名词
