pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism: /ˌsuːdoʊˌsuːdoʊˌhaɪpoʊˌpærəθaɪˈrɔɪdɪzəm/ | n. | 假性假性甲状旁腺功能减退症 | A rare genetic disorder characterized by some, but not all, of the symptoms of hypoparathyroidism.  It's a misnomer, as it doesn't involve true hypoparathyroidism.  The symptoms can include short stature, round face, short metacarpals and metatarsals, and sometimes intellectual disability.  The condition is caused by mutations in the GNAS gene. | The doctor suspected pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism after reviewing the patient's symptoms and family history.  | 近义词:  (No perfect synonyms, as it's a very specific condition.  Related terms might include hypoparathyroidism, Albright hereditary osteodystrophy.) | 反义词: (No direct antonyms) | 名词

PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism" due to its rarity and complexity.  The word itself is often used for humorous effect to illustrate the length and complexity of medical terms.

词源:
The word is a combination of several Greek and Latin roots:

* **pseudo-**: (Greek) meaning "false" or "seemingly"
* **hypo-**: (Greek) meaning "under" or "deficient"
* **para-**: (Greek) meaning "beside" or "near"
* **thyroid-**: (Greek) referring to the thyroid gland
* **-ism**: (suffix) indicating a state, condition, or doctrine


The term is built upon the term "hypoparathyroidism," implying a false or seemingly deficient state related to the parathyroid glands, but without the true deficiency.  The repetition of "pseudo-" emphasizes this false nature.
