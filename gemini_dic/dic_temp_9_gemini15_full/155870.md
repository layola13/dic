photo-oxidizable: /ˌfoʊtoʊˈɒksɪdaɪzəbəl/ | adj. | 可光氧化的 |  Able to be oxidized by light.  This term refers to substances that undergo chemical oxidation when exposed to light, typically ultraviolet (UV) light. The oxidation process often leads to degradation or discoloration of the material.  |  Many polymers are photo-oxidizable and degrade over time when exposed to sunlight.  | 近义词: light-sensitive, light-degradable | 反义词: photostable


USAGE->
