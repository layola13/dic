词源:
The word "incurtain" is a relatively modern coinage, possibly a blend of "in" (meaning "inside" or "within") and "curtain" (referring to a concealing barrier).  There is no established etymology in major dictionaries, suggesting its relatively recent and informal usage.  The meaning derives from the idea of something being hidden or shielded like behind a curtain.
