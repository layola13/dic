词源:

The word "disinterestedness" is derived from the adjective "disinterested," which itself comes from the verb "to interest."  The prefix "dis-" indicates a lack or absence of something. Therefore, "disinterested" originally meant "unbiased" or "impartial," lacking personal interest that might cloud judgment. Over time, the word has acquired a secondary, more common meaning of lacking interest or enthusiasm.  "Disinterestedness" simply reflects this adjective's primary meaning – the state of being unbiased and impartial.


用法说明:


While "disinterestedness" can sometimes be used to describe a lack of interest or enthusiasm, its primary and more accurate meaning is impartiality and objectivity.  This is particularly important in contexts requiring unbiased judgment, such as legal proceedings or scientific research.  Using it to mean simply "lack of interest" is technically incorrect, though increasingly common in informal speech.  The context is crucial to understanding the intended meaning.
