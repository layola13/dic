PHRASE->
There is no direct common phrase using "perishablesnesses".  The word itself is relatively uncommon and usually replaced with simpler terms like "perishability" or descriptions of the perishable items.  However, we can create examples using related concepts:

Reducing perishability through... = 通过……减少易腐烂性

词源:

The word "perishablesnesses" is derived from "perishable" + "-ness" (a suffix indicating a state or quality) + "-es" (plural suffix).  "Perishable" itself comes from the verb "perish," meaning to be destroyed or die, ultimately from Old French *perir and Latin *perire.
