planogamete:/ˈplænəɡeɪmiːt/| n. |游动配子；具有鞭毛的配子 |A planogamete is a motile gamete, meaning it is a reproductive cell that can move independently, typically by means of flagella.  Planogametes are found in many algae and some fungi. They are involved in sexual reproduction, where two planogametes fuse to form a zygote. | Example:  Many algae species utilize planogametes for fertilization. 许多藻类物种利用游动配子进行受精。|近义词：motile gamete, flagellated gamete |反义词：static gamete, non-motile gamete

USAGE->
一般现在时:
Planogametes fuse to form a zygote. = 游动配子融合形成合子。
Algae utilize planogametes for reproduction. = 藻类利用游动配子进行繁殖。

一般过去时:
The scientists observed the planogametes swimming. = 科学家观察到游动配子在游泳。
The researchers studied how planogametes find each other. = 研究人员研究了游动配子如何找到彼此。

现在完成时:
Researchers have identified many species with planogametes. = 研究人员已经发现了许多具有游动配子的物种。

过去完成时:
Before the fusion, the planogametes had already undergone chemotaxis. = 在融合之前，游动配子已经经历了趋化性。
The zygote had formed after the two planogametes had fused. = 两个游动配子融合后合子就形成了。

将来时:
Scientists will further investigate the mechanism of planogamete motility. = 科学家们将进一步研究游动配子运动的机制。

疑问句:
What triggers the motility of planogametes? = 什么触发了游动配子的运动？
How do planogametes find their mating partners? = 游动配子如何找到它们的交配对象？

否定句:
The sample did not contain any viable planogametes. = 样本中不包含任何可存活的游动配子。
The experiment did not show a significant difference in planogamete motility. = 实验没有显示游动配子运动性的显著差异。
