词源:

The word "liberalises" comes from the adjective "liberal," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "liberalis," meaning "of or pertaining to freedom," from "liber," meaning "free."  The suffix "-ise" (or "-ize" in American English) is a verb-forming suffix indicating "to make or become." Thus, "liberalises" means "to make free or more free."
