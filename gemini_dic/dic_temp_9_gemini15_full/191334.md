The word "scentingly" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is not possible.  There's no established pronunciation, grammatical classification, definition, or common usage.  It is likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.

If you meant a different word, or if you can provide more context where you encountered "scentingly," I can try to provide a more helpful response.
