Etymology:

The term "country-and-western" is a compound term, combining "country" and "western."  Both words reflect the genre's origins and musical influences.

* **Country:**  Refers to the folk music traditions of the rural Southern United States.  These traditions encompassed various styles, including ballads, blues influences, and gospel music.  The term evolved from earlier designations like "hillbilly music" which was considered derogatory.

* **Western:**  Reflects the influence of cowboy songs and other musical styles associated with the American West.  These often featured themes of cowboys, ranches, and the frontier spirit.

The two terms were combined to encompass the broader genre that emerged from the blending of these distinct yet related musical styles.  Over time, "country" has largely superseded "country-and-western," with the latter now often considered slightly outdated.
