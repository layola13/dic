pseudofovea: /ˌsuːdoʊˈfoʊviə/ | n. | 伪中央凹 |


英文解析:A pseudofovea is a region in the retina of some animals, particularly birds, that functions similarly to the fovea in primates, but lacks the same high density of cones.  It provides enhanced visual acuity in a specific area of the visual field, but its structure and visual performance are not as refined as a true fovea.  The term "pseudo" indicates that it's a false or similar, but not identical, structure to a true fovea.

例句:

The eagle's pseudofovea allows it to spot prey from a great distance.  = 鹰的伪中央凹使它能够从很远的地方发现猎物。

Studies on avian vision have revealed that the structure and function of the pseudofovea vary significantly across different bird species. =  关于鸟类视觉的研究表明，不同鸟类的伪中央凹的结构和功能差异很大。
