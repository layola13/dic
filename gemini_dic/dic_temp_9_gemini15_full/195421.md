seminasality: /ˌsɛmɪˈnæzəlɪti/ | n. | 半鼻音性；半鼻化 |

英文解析: Seminasality refers to a speech sound that is partially nasalized.  It's a condition where the sound is produced with a combination of oral and nasal airflow, falling between a fully oral sound and a fully nasal sound. This can occur due to various factors, including anatomical variations, coarticulation effects (influence of neighboring sounds), or speech disorders.  The degree of nasality can vary significantly.

例句:

The speaker's pronunciation exhibited a noticeable seminasality in certain vowels.  =  说话者在某些元音的发音中表现出明显的半鼻音性。

The seminasality of the consonant was attributed to the following nasal vowel. =  辅音的半鼻音性归因于后面的鼻元音。


近义词: partial nasalization

反义词:  full orality, complete absence of nasalization


词性: noun (名词)


由于seminasality是一个相对专业的语音学术语，它没有广泛的用法和对应的各种时态变化。因此，我没有按照要求提供USAGE部分。  这个词主要用于描述语音现象，通常出现在语音学研究论文或教科书中。  也没有常见的词组搭配。
