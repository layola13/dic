词源:
The word "herald" comes from Old French "heralt," ultimately from Germanic roots related to words meaning "army" or "soldier".  Originally, a herald was an official messenger or announcer, often associated with royalty or nobility.  The modern usage retains some of this sense of announcing important events or changes.
