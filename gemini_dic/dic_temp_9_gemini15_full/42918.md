covalent:/koʊˈveɪlənt/ | adj. | 共价的 | Relating to or denoting chemical bonds formed by the sharing of electrons between atoms.  Covalent bonds are a type of chemical bond where two atoms share one or more pairs of electrons. This sharing allows each atom to achieve a stable electron configuration, similar to that of a noble gas.  | Example: Water (H₂O) is a molecule held together by covalent bonds. 水 (H₂O) 是由共价键结合的分子。|近义词：shared-electron | 反义词：ionic


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The molecule is held together by covalent bonds. = 这个分子是由共价键结合在一起的。
Covalent bonds share electrons between atoms. = 共价键在原子之间共享电子。


一般过去时:
Scientists discovered the nature of covalent bonds. = 科学家们发现了共价键的性质。
The experiment demonstrated covalent bonding. = 实验演示了共价键。


现在完成时:
Researchers have studied covalent bonds extensively. = 研究人员已经广泛研究了共价键。
We have learned about covalent bonding in chemistry class. = 我们在化学课上学到了共价键。


过去完成时:
They had already understood covalent bonding before the experiment. = 他们早在实验之前就理解了共价键。
Scientists had previously identified many covalent compounds. = 科学家们先前已经鉴定出许多共价化合物。


将来时:
We will study covalent bonds in detail next week. = 我们下周将详细学习共价键。
Scientists will continue to investigate covalent bonding. = 科学家们将继续研究共价键。


虚拟语气:
If the atoms shared electrons, a covalent bond would form. = 如果原子共享电子，就会形成共价键。
It would be helpful if we understood covalent bonding better. = 如果我们能更好地理解共价键就好了。


被动语态:
Covalent bonds are formed by the sharing of electrons. = 共价键是由电子共享形成的。
The structure was analyzed to understand its covalent bonding. = 对该结构进行了分析以了解其共价键。


疑问句:
Are these bonds covalent or ionic? = 这些键是共价键还是离子键？
How many covalent bonds does carbon form? = 碳能形成多少个共价键？


否定句:
The bond is not covalent; it's ionic. = 该键不是共价键；它是离子键。
These molecules do not have covalent bonds. = 这些分子没有共价键。


PHRASE->
covalent bond = 共价键
covalent compound = 共价化合物
covalent radius = 共价半径
covalent interaction = 共价相互作用
covalent linkage = 共价连接
