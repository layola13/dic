词源:
The word "reckoning" comes from the Old English word "reccan," meaning "to tell," "to speak," or "to count."  Over time, this evolved into the Middle English "reken," and eventually the modern "reckon." The noun form "reckoning" developed from the verb, reflecting the act of counting or calculating.  The sense of "judgment" or "retribution" emerged later, likely due to the association of counting and settling accounts with the consequences of one's actions.
