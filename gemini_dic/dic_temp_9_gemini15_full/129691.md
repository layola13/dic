non-disjunctional: /ˌnɒn dɪsˈdʒʌŋkʃənəl/ | adj. | 非分离的；不分离的 |  Relating to or characterized by the failure of chromosomes to separate properly during cell division (meiosis or mitosis). This can lead to aneuploidy, where cells have an abnormal number of chromosomes.  | Example: Non-disjunctional errors during meiosis can result in Down syndrome.  非分离错误在减数分裂过程中会导致唐氏综合症。 | 近义词:  aneuploidogenic (causing aneuploidy) | 反义词: disjunctional (referring to the normal separation of chromosomes)


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Non-disjunctional errors are a common cause of birth defects. = 非分离错误是出生缺陷的常见原因。
The process is non-disjunctional in nature. = 这个过程本质上是非分离的。


一般过去时:
The researchers observed a non-disjunctional event during their experiment. = 研究人员在实验中观察到非分离事件。
The study showed that non-disjunctional meiosis led to sterility. = 研究表明，非分离减数分裂导致不育。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several genes associated with non-disjunctional events. = 科学家已经确定了几个与非分离事件相关的基因。
Researchers have found that environmental factors can influence non-disjunctional rates. = 研究人员发现环境因素会影响非分离率。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the mechanism of non-disjunctional errors was largely unknown. = 在发现之前，非分离错误的机制在很大程度上是未知的。
It had been hypothesized that non-disjunctional events were rare, but studies have shown otherwise. = 曾假设非分离事件很少见，但研究表明并非如此。


将来时:
Further research will investigate the mechanisms of non-disjunctional chromosome segregation. = 进一步的研究将调查非分离染色体分离的机制。
We will use advanced techniques to detect non-disjunctional events in early embryos. = 我们将使用先进的技术来检测早期胚胎中的非分离事件。


虚拟语气:
If non-disjunctional events were more frequent, the birth rate of affected individuals would be higher. = 如果非分离事件更频繁，受影响个体的出生率将会更高。
It is hypothesized that if non-disjunctional errors are not corrected, severe consequences will follow. = 假设如果非分离错误未得到纠正，将产生严重的后果。


被动语态:
Non-disjunctional events are often detected through karyotyping. = 非分离事件通常通过核型分析来检测。
The rate of non-disjunctional errors can be influenced by various factors. = 非分离错误的发生率可能会受到各种因素的影响。


疑问句:
What are the known risk factors for non-disjunctional events? = 非分离事件的已知危险因素是什么？
How can non-disjunctional errors be prevented? = 如何预防非分离错误？


否定句:
This cell division was not non-disjunctional; the chromosomes separated normally. = 这次细胞分裂不是非分离的；染色体正常分离。
The results did not indicate a significant increase in non-disjunctional events. = 结果并未表明非分离事件的显著增加。
