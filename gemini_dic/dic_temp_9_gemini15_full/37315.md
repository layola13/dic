词源：

The word "commemorable" comes from the Latin word "commemorare," which means "to keep in memory" or "to remind."  The prefix "com-" means "together," and "memorare" is related to "memory."  Therefore, "commemorable" literally means "worthy of being remembered together" or "worthy of being jointly remembered."
