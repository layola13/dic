disdiaclast: /ˌdɪsdaɪˈæklæst/ | n. |节理，裂隙 | A disdiaclast is a secondary fracture in a rock mass, typically resulting from tectonic stress or other geological processes.  Unlike joints, disdiaclasts show evidence of relative movement along the fracture plane. They often appear as sets of parallel or subparallel fractures. | Example: The geologist identified several sets of disdiaclasts in the outcrop, indicating significant past tectonic activity.  地质学家在露头上发现了多组节理，表明过去存在明显的构造活动。 | 近义词: joint, fracture, crack | 反义词:  (无明确反义词，可考虑与未断裂的完整岩石对比) | 词性: 名词


USAGE->
(由于disdiaclast是一个名词，不适用时态变化)

一般现在时:
The rock shows many disdiaclasts. = 这块岩石显示出许多节理。
Geologists study the formation of disdiaclasts. = 地质学家研究节理的形成。


一般过去时:
The earthquake created new disdiaclasts in the mountain. = 地震在山里造成了新的节理。
We observed several disdiaclasts during the field trip. = 我们在实地考察中观察到几个节理。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified many disdiaclasts in this region. = 科学家们在这个地区发现了许多节理。
The researchers have studied the effects of weathering on disdiaclasts. = 研究人员研究了风化对节理的影响。


过去完成时:
Before the landslide, there were fewer disdiaclasts visible. = 山体滑坡前，可见的节理较少。
They had already mapped the disdiaclasts before the excavation began. = 在挖掘开始之前，他们已经绘制了节理图。


将来时:
Further analysis will reveal more about the disdiaclasts' origins. = 进一步的分析将揭示更多关于节理起源的信息。
We will investigate the disdiaclasts' impact on groundwater flow. = 我们将调查节理对地下水流的影响。


虚拟语气:
If the rock contained more disdiaclasts, it would be more fractured. = 如果岩石包含更多节理，它就会更加破碎。
I wish I had known about the disdiaclasts before the drilling. = 我希望在钻探之前就知道这些节理。


被动语态:
The disdiaclasts were formed by tectonic forces. = 节理是由构造力形成的。
The orientations of the disdiaclasts are being analyzed. = 节理的方向正在被分析。


疑问句:
Are these fractures disdiaclasts or joints? = 这些裂缝是节理还是节理？
How many disdiaclasts are visible in this image? = 在这张图片中可见多少节理？


否定句:
The sample did not show any significant disdiaclasts. = 样本没有显示任何明显的节理。
This area lacks extensive disdiaclasts. = 这个地区缺乏广泛的节理。


PHRASE->
(由于disdiaclast本身就是一个专业术语，其短语搭配相对较少，以下列举一些可能的搭配)
sets of disdiaclasts: 一组节理
system of disdiaclasts: 节理系统
orientation of disdiaclasts: 节理方向
analysis of disdiaclasts: 节理分析
distribution of disdiaclasts: 节理分布


词源:  The word "disdiaclast" is a relatively specialized geological term. It combines the prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart" or "away"), "dia-" (meaning "through" or "across"), and "clast" (referring to a fragment or broken piece of rock). Therefore, it literally suggests a fracture where there is movement across the fracture plane.
