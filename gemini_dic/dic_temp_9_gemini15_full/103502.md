词源:

The word "jockstrap" is a compound word.  "Jock" is a shortened form of "jockey," originally referring to a horse rider but later used informally to refer to an athlete, especially in sports like American football. "Strap" refers to a strip of material used for fastening or supporting something.  Therefore, "jockstrap" literally means a strap worn by a jock (athlete).  Its usage became common in the 20th century.
