pegmatite:/ˈpeɡmətaɪt/| n. |伟晶岩|A pegmatite is an igneous rock with unusually large crystals.  These crystals are typically several centimeters to several meters in length, and some can even be larger.  Pegmatites are formed from magma that cools slowly and contains a high concentration of water and volatile compounds. This allows the crystals to grow to an exceptional size. They are often associated with granitic intrusions and are known for containing valuable minerals such as rare earth elements, lithium, beryllium, and gemstones. |Example: The miners discovered a rich vein of tourmaline in the pegmatite deposit.  矿工们在伟晶岩矿床中发现了一条丰富的电气石矿脉。 The pegmatite intrusion cut across the surrounding metamorphic rocks. 伟晶岩侵入体切穿了周围的变质岩。|近义词：granite (in some contexts), igneous rock |反义词：无


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Pegmatite forms from slowly cooling magma. = 伟晶岩由缓慢冷却的岩浆形成。
This pegmatite contains rare minerals. = 这块伟晶岩含有稀有矿物。

一般过去时:
Geologists studied the pegmatite body. = 地质学家研究了伟晶岩体。
The miners extracted minerals from the pegmatite. = 矿工们从伟晶岩中提取矿物。

现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered many valuable minerals in pegmatites. = 科学家们已经在伟晶岩中发现了许多有价值的矿物。
Researchers have analyzed the chemical composition of this pegmatite. = 研究人员分析了这块伟晶岩的化学成分。

过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the pegmatite had remained unexplored. = 在发现之前，伟晶岩一直未被勘探。
The rock had cooled slowly, forming large crystals. = 岩石缓慢冷却，形成了巨大的晶体。

将来时:
Geologists will continue to study pegmatites for valuable minerals. = 地质学家将继续研究伟晶岩以寻找有价值的矿物。
We will analyze the samples from the pegmatite next week. = 我们下周将分析来自伟晶岩的样本。

虚拟语气:
If this were a typical granite, it wouldn't contain such large crystals. = 如果这是典型的花岗岩，它就不会含有这么大的晶体。
I wish I could study that giant pegmatite in person. = 我希望我能亲自研究那块巨大的伟晶岩。

被动语态:
The pegmatite was formed by slow cooling. = 伟晶岩是通过缓慢冷却形成的。
The samples are being analyzed in the laboratory. = 样本正在实验室里进行分析。

疑问句:
What minerals are commonly found in pegmatites? = 伟晶岩中通常发现哪些矿物？
Is this rock a pegmatite or a granite? = 这块岩石是伟晶岩还是花岗岩？

否定句:
This rock is not a pegmatite; it's a granite. = 这块岩石不是伟晶岩；它是花岗岩。
The pegmatite did not contain any gemstones. = 这块伟晶岩不含任何宝石。


PHRASE->
pegmatite dike = 伟晶岩脉
pegmatite body = 伟晶岩体
pegmatite mineral = 伟晶岩矿物
rare-element pegmatite = 稀有元素伟晶岩
giant pegmatite = 巨型伟晶岩
