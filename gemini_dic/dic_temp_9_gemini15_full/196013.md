词源:  The word "sentimentally" derives from the noun "sentiment," which comes from the Old French word "sentiment," meaning "feeling, thought."  This, in turn, originates from the Latin word "sentire," meaning "to feel, perceive."  The suffix "-ally" is an adverbial suffix, transforming the noun into an adjective describing a manner or quality.
