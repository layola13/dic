词源:
The word "impart" comes from the Old French word "impartir," meaning "to divide, share, distribute."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "impartire," which is a combination of the prefix "im-" (meaning "into" or "upon") and the verb "partire" (meaning "to divide" or "to share").  The evolution of the word shows a shift in meaning from a physical act of division to a more abstract act of sharing information or qualities.
