词源:
The origin of "hobnob" is uncertain, but it's likely a combination of "hob" (meaning a small, domestic spirit or goblin) and "nob" (a shortened form of "nobleman").  The exact semantic connection is unclear but implies a casual mixing of social classes.  The word's modern usage reflects this earlier sense of informal interaction between people of different social standing.
