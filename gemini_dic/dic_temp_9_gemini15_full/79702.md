glucagon:/ˈɡluːkəɡɒn/|/ˈɡluːkəɡɑːn/| n. |胰高血糖素|A hormone formed in the pancreas that promotes the breakdown of glycogen to glucose in the liver.  Glucagon causes a rise in blood sugar levels. |例句：Glucagon is released when blood sugar levels are low. = 胰高血糖素在血糖水平低时释放。|例句：The doctor administered glucagon to counteract the hypoglycemia. = 医生注射胰高血糖素来对抗低血糖。|近义词：hyperglycemic agent|反义词：insulin|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Glucagon regulates blood sugar levels. = 胰高血糖素调节血糖水平。
The pancreas produces glucagon. = 胰腺产生胰高血糖素。


一般过去时:
The patient received a glucagon injection. = 病人接受了胰高血糖素注射。
Researchers studied the effects of glucagon. = 研究人员研究了胰高血糖素的作用。


现在完成时:
Doctors have used glucagon for decades to treat hypoglycemia. = 几十年来，医生一直使用胰高血糖素来治疗低血糖。
Scientists have discovered more about glucagon's function. = 科学家们已经发现了更多关于胰高血糖素功能的信息。


过去完成时:
The blood sugar had dropped significantly before the glucagon was administered. = 在注射胰高血糖素之前，血糖已经显著下降。
They had already researched the effects of glucagon on the liver. = 他们之前已经研究了胰高血糖素对肝脏的影响。


将来时:
The doctor will administer glucagon if the blood sugar falls too low. = 如果血糖下降得太低，医生会注射胰高血糖素。
They will continue to study the role of glucagon in metabolism. = 他们将继续研究胰高血糖素在代谢中的作用。


虚拟语气:
If the patient had received glucagon earlier, the outcome might have been different. = 如果病人早点注射胰高血糖素，结果可能会有所不同。
It is essential that the glucagon be administered promptly. = 及时注射胰高血糖素至关重要。


被动语态:
Glucagon is produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas. = 胰高血糖素是由胰腺的α细胞产生的。
The effects of glucagon are being studied extensively. = 胰高血糖素的作用正在被广泛研究。


疑问句:
Does glucagon raise or lower blood sugar? = 胰高血糖素是升高还是降低血糖？
What are the side effects of glucagon administration? = 注射胰高血糖素的副作用是什么？


否定句:
Glucagon does not lower blood sugar levels. = 胰高血糖素不会降低血糖水平。
The study did not find any significant negative effects of glucagon. = 该研究没有发现胰高血糖素的任何显著负面影响。



PHRASE->
glucagon injection = 胰高血糖素注射
glucagon secretion = 胰高血糖素分泌
glucagon receptor = 胰高血糖素受体
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) = 胰高血糖素样肽-1
glucagon deficiency = 胰高血糖素缺乏


词源:
From gluco- (glucose) + -agon (agent).  It indicates a substance that acts on glucose metabolism.
