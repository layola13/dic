The word "ragious" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis following the requested format is impossible.  There is no pronunciation, definition, etymology, or usage to provide.  It's possible that it's:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A neologism:** A newly coined word not yet widely accepted.
* **A word from a specialized field:**  It might be jargon used in a specific area of study or profession.
* **A proper noun:** It could be a name or place name.


If you can provide more context or clarify the spelling, I can attempt to provide a more helpful response.
