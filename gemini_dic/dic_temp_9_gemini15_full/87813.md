词源:
The origin of "hick" is uncertain, but it's likely derived from onomatopoeia, imitating the sound of a hiccup.  Over time, it transitioned from a relatively neutral term to a derogatory label for rural people.  The connection might be related to the perceived awkwardness or simplemindedness associated with rural folk.
