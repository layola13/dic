/nɒnˈbænɪʃmənts/| n.|非放逐；不被放逐的状态|The absence of banishment; the state of not being banished or exiled.  This word is a relatively rare and newly coined term, largely found in specialized legal or historical contexts discussing exceptions to or absences of traditional banishment practices.  It is primarily understood through its component parts: "non-" (not) and "banishments" (the act of banishing).|例句：The king's decree granted nonbanishments to those who pledged allegiance. 国王的法令给予效忠者免于放逐的权利。


The historical context surrounding the word is crucial.  Historically, banishment was a common legal punishment.  Therefore, "nonbanishments" highlights situations where this punishment was not applied, either through legal exception, pardon, or simply the absence of such a practice.
