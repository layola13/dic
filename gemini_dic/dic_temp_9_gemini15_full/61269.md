词源:

The word "emasculated" comes from the Latin word "emasculare," which means "to castrate."  The prefix "e-" means "out" or "from," and "masculus" means "male." Thus, the original meaning referred specifically to the surgical removal of the testicles. Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass a weakening or deprivation of strength, power, or vigor, often in a metaphorical sense.
