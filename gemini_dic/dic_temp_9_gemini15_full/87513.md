heterodimer:/ˌhɛtərəˈdaɪmər/| n. |异二聚体|A heterodimer is a protein complex formed by two different subunits.  These subunits can be different proteins or different isoforms of the same protein. Heterodimers play crucial roles in many biological processes, often exhibiting properties different from those of their individual subunits.|Example: The transcription factor NF-κB is a heterodimer composed of p50 and p65 subunits.  This heterodimer binds to DNA and regulates gene expression.  /转录因子NF-κB是由p50和p65亚基组成的异二聚体。这种异二聚体与DNA结合并调节基因表达。|近义词:dimeric complex, protein complex|反义词:homodimer
