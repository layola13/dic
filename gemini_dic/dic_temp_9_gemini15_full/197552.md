词源:
The word "shellfish" comes from the Old English "sculfisc," a compound of "sculc" (shell) and "fisc" (fish).  While the "fish" part is now considered somewhat inaccurate as many shellfish are not fish, the term has persisted through Middle English to Modern English.  The term reflects a historical understanding of these creatures.
