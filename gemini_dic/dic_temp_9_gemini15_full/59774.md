ecophene:/ˈɛkəfiːn/| n.|生态型，生态表型|A readily reversible phenotypic variation in response to environmental conditions.  An ecophene is a phenotypic variation within a species caused by environmental factors, not genetic differences. Unlike a morph, an ecophene is not heritable and disappears when the environmental conditions causing it change. |例句：The different leaf shapes of the plant are ecophenes, reflecting varying levels of sunlight. 这株植物不同的叶形是生态型，反映了不同的日照水平。

The color variation in these butterflies is an ecophene, induced by temperature differences during development. 这些蝴蝶的颜色差异是生态型，是由发育期间的温度差异引起的。|近义词：phenotype, morph (although morphs are often genetically determined)|反义词：genotype
