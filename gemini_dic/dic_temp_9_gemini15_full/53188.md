词源:  The word comes from "dipsomania," which itself is a combination of the Greek words  "dipsa" (δίψα), meaning "thirst," and "mania" (μανία), meaning "madness" or "insanity."  Therefore, dipsomania literally means "a madness of thirst," referring to an uncontrollable craving for alcohol.  The "-iacal" suffix is added to create the adjectival form.
