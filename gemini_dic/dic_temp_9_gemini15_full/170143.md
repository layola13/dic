protogine:/ˈproʊtədʒin/ | n. | 原长岩 | A metamorphic rock formed from granite or other felsic igneous rocks through a process involving metasomatism, typically involving the addition of sodium and potassium.  Protogines are characterized by the presence of abundant muscovite and sometimes other minerals like tourmaline. | The protogine outcrops were extensively studied to understand the regional metamorphic history. 原长岩露头被广泛研究以了解区域变质历史。| 近义词:gneiss, granite(in its pre-metamorphic state)| 反义词:None specifically, but rocks formed through different processes would be considered antonyms in a broad sense.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The geologist studies the protogine samples. = 地质学家正在研究原长岩样本。
Protogine often contains abundant muscovite. = 原长岩通常含有丰富的白云母。


一般过去时:
They analyzed the protogine's mineral composition. = 他们分析了原长岩的矿物成分。
The researchers mapped the distribution of protogine. = 研究人员绘制了原长岩的分布图。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several protogine formations. = 科学家们已经确定了几种原长岩地层。
Geologists have extensively studied the protogine's properties. = 地质学家们已经广泛研究了原长岩的特性。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, they had prepared the protogine samples. = 在分析之前，他们已经准备好了原长岩样品。
They had already discovered the unique mineral composition of the protogine. = 他们已经发现了原长岩独特的矿物成分。


将来时:
They will examine the protogine under a microscope. = 他们将在显微镜下检查原长岩。
Researchers will further investigate the formation of protogine. = 研究人员将进一步研究原长岩的形成。


虚拟语气:
If the rock were protogine, it would contain abundant muscovite. = 如果岩石是原长岩，它将含有丰富的白云母。
I wish I had more protogine samples for analysis. = 我希望我有更多的原长岩样品用于分析。


被动语态:
The protogine samples were carefully examined. = 原长岩样品被仔细检查了。
The age of the protogine is being determined using radiometric dating. = 原长岩的年龄正在使用放射性测年法确定。


疑问句:
Is this rock protogine? = 这块岩石是原长岩吗？
What is the geological origin of this protogine? = 这块原长岩的地质成因是什么？


否定句:
This rock is not protogine; it's a gneiss. = 这块岩石不是原长岩；它是片麻岩。
The sample did not contain the typical muscovite content of protogine. = 样本不含原长岩典型的白云母含量。
