Etymology:

The word "generousness" derives from the Old French word "genereus," meaning "noble, generous."  This, in turn, comes from the Latin word "generosus," which itself is derived from "genus," meaning "race, kind, birth."  The original sense implied nobility of birth and character, which were often associated with generosity. Over time, the meaning shifted to primarily focus on the act of giving and sharing.
