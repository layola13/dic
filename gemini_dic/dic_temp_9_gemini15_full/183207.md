词源:

The word "representable" is derived from the verb "represent," which comes from the Old French *representer and ultimately from the Latin *repræsentare.  *Repræsentare is a compound of *re- (again, back) and *præsentare (to present).  Thus, "representable" literally means "capable of being presented again" or "capable of being presented in a particular form."
