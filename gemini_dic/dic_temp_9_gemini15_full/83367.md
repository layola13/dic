gyroma:/ˈdʒaɪroʊmə/| n. |陀螺仪；回转仪 |A gyroma is a device used to measure or maintain orientation and angular velocity. It typically uses a spinning rotor to sense changes in orientation.  |Example: The aircraft's gyroma helped maintain its stability during the turbulent flight.  飞机的陀螺仪帮助其在颠簸的飞行中保持稳定。|近义词：gyro, rotational sensor |反义词：None.
