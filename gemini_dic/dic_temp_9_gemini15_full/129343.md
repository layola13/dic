词源:

The word "noisome" comes from the Middle English word "noisum," which itself comes from the Old French word "enuisum."  The Old French word is a combination of "enuier" (to annoy, to harm) and the suffix "-sum" (full of).  Therefore, the original meaning was "full of annoyance" or "harmful." Over time, the meaning shifted to focus specifically on unpleasant smells and generally unpleasant things.


用法说明:

"Noisome" is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that is extremely unpleasant, especially in terms of smell or atmosphere.  It carries a stronger connotation of disgust and offensiveness than simply "unpleasant."  It is often used to describe things like smells, environments, and even behavior.
