The word "kiay" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible. It's likely a slang term, a word from a specific dialect, or a misspelling.  To provide the requested analysis, I need more context about where you encountered this word.  For example:
