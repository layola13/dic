词源:
The word "forfeiture" comes from the Old French word "forfaiture," meaning "wrongdoing, offense, crime."  This ultimately derives from the Latin word "forisfacere," meaning "to do wrong,"  composed of "foris" (outside, beyond) and "facere" (to do, make).  The evolution reflects the concept of forfeiture as a penalty for actions outside the bounds of acceptable behavior.
