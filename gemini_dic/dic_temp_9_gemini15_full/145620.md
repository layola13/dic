词源:
The word "overconsideration" is a compound word formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the noun "consideration" (the act of thinking carefully about something).  "Consideration" itself derives from the Latin word "considerare," meaning "to look at carefully," which is composed of "con-" (together) and "siderare" (to view the stars).
