perimysial:/ˌpɛrɪˈmɪziəl/| adj.|肌束膜的；肌束周的|Relating to the perimysium, the connective tissue sheath that surrounds bundles of muscle fibers (fascicles).  Perimysial refers to the structures, processes, or characteristics associated with this sheath.|The perimysial connective tissue plays a crucial role in muscle fiber organization and force transmission.|近义词：fascicular (referring to fascicles)|反义词：epimysial (referring to the outermost sheath), endomysial (referring to the sheath surrounding individual muscle fibers)
