词源:
The word "pug" comes from the Latin word *pugnus*, meaning "fist." This likely refers to the dog's short, wrinkled face, which resembles a clenched fist.  The association with a short, stocky build also plays a role.  The use of "pug" to describe a person is a later development, derived from the dog's generally stubborn and determined nature.
