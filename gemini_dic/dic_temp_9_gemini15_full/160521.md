porism:/ˈpɔːrɪzəm/| n. |数学中的剩余定理，推论|A porism, in mathematics, is a proposition asserting the possibility of finding such conditions as will render a problem indeterminate, or capable of innumerable solutions.  It is a kind of intermediate link between a theorem and a problem.  A theorem asserts the existence of certain relations between given things; a problem proposes to find certain things that shall satisfy given relations; and a porism asserts that certain things can be found that shall satisfy given relations, the number of solutions being infinite. |Euclid's lost book of Porisms is a famous example of this type of mathematical statement.  The exact nature of porisms remains a subject of debate among mathematicians.|近义词：corollary, deduction, inference|反义词：theorem (in the context of its mathematical relationship)
