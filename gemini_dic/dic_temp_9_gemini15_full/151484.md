1. **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please double-check your spelling.
2. **A proper noun:** A name, place, or brand.  If so, more context is needed.
3. **A neologism or slang term:** A newly coined word or a word used within a specific community.  Again, context would be helpful.
4. **A word from another language:**  If so, please specify the language.
