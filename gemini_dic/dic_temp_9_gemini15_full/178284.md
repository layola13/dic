reconcentrado:  /ˌriːkɒnˈsɛntreɪdəʊ/ | adj. |  重新集中；重新安置的 |  The word "reconcentrado" is primarily a Spanish term, not an English one. It refers to a policy implemented in Cuba during the Spanish-American War.  It involved the forced relocation of Cuban civilians into designated areas, ostensibly for their own protection but in reality to suppress the rebellion against Spanish rule.  The English equivalent would be something like "re-concentrated" or "interned," depending on the context. | Example: The reconcentrado camps were notorious for their harsh conditions and high mortality rates.  重新集中营因其恶劣的条件和高死亡率而臭名昭著。 | 近义词: concentrated, regrouped, interned | 反义词: dispersed, scattered | adj.
