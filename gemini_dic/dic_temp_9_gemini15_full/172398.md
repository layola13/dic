词源:

The word "puzzler" derives from the verb "puzzle," which comes from the Middle English word "posen," meaning "to ponder, to think about."  "Posen" is related to the Old French word "poser," meaning "to put, to place."  The sense of "to puzzle" developed from the idea of putting together pieces of a problem to find a solution. The suffix "-er" is added to create the noun form, indicating a person or thing that puzzles.
