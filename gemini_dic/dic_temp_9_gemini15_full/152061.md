词源:

The word "patenting" derives from the noun "patent," which comes from the Old French word "patent," meaning "open, evident, manifest."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "patēns,"  participle of "patēre," meaning "to lie open, be open, be evident." The legal sense of "patent" developed gradually, reflecting the idea of an invention being openly disclosed in exchange for exclusive rights.
