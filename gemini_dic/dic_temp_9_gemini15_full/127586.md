nectosac:  /ˈnɛktoʊsæk/ | n. | 颈囊 |  A sac-like structure in the neck region of certain animals, often associated with the circulatory or respiratory system.  It can have various functions depending on the species. For example, in some invertebrates it may be involved in buoyancy control, while in others it might play a role in gas exchange.  The term is often used in zoology and comparative anatomy. |  The nectosac of the jellyfish helps it maintain buoyancy. | 近义词:  (depending on specific function) swim bladder, air sac | 反义词: None directly applicable.


USAGE->
This word is highly specialized and doesn't lend itself to common grammatical usage like "what."  Example sentences will focus on its biological context.


一般现在时:
The nectosac regulates the jellyfish's buoyancy. = 颈囊调节水母的浮力。
The nectosac assists in gas exchange in this species. = 在这个物种中，颈囊辅助气体交换。


一般过去时:
The researchers observed the nectosac's function during the experiment. = 研究人员在实验中观察了颈囊的功能。
The damaged nectosac impaired the animal's swimming ability. = 受损的颈囊损害了动物的游泳能力。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the nectosac's evolution extensively. = 科学家们已经广泛研究了颈囊的进化。
Researchers have found variations in nectosac structure across different species. = 研究人员发现不同物种的颈囊结构存在差异。


过去完成时:
Before the injury, the nectosac had functioned normally. = 在受伤之前，颈囊功能正常。
The animal had lost its buoyancy control because the nectosac had ruptured. = 动物失去了浮力控制，因为颈囊破裂了。


将来时:
Further research will investigate the nectosac's role in deep-sea species. = 后续研究将调查颈囊在深海物种中的作用。
Scientists will analyze the nectosac's composition to understand its function better. = 科学家们将分析颈囊的成分以更好地了解其功能。


虚拟语气:
If the nectosac were damaged, the jellyfish would struggle to swim. = 如果颈囊受损，水母将难以游泳。
I wish we had better imaging to study the internal structure of the nectosac. = 我希望我们有更好的成像技术来研究颈囊的内部结构。


被动语态:
The nectosac's function is still being investigated by scientists. = 颈囊的功能仍在由科学家研究中。
The nectosac's structure was observed under a microscope. = 颈囊的结构在显微镜下观察。


疑问句:
What is the exact function of the nectosac in this species? = 这个物种中颈囊的确切功能是什么？
Does the nectosac play a significant role in the animal's survival? = 颈囊在动物的生存中起着重要的作用吗？


否定句:
The jellyfish did not have a fully developed nectosac. = 这只水母没有完全发育的颈囊。
The nectosac did not show any signs of damage after the observation. = 观察后颈囊没有显示任何损坏迹象。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "nectosac" as it is a highly specialized term.  Phrases would be formed only within the context of zoological discussion.  For example, one might discuss "nectosac development," "nectosac morphology," or "nectosac function."
