This word is not commonly used. It's a rather obscure and heavily derived noun.


英文解析:  "Produciblenesses" is the plural form of "producibleness," which itself is an uncommon noun derived from the adjective "producible."  It refers to the state or quality of being producible; the degree to which something can be produced or manufactured.  The addition of "-nesses" adds a sense of multiple aspects or degrees of producibility.


例句:

The report compared the produciblenesses of various manufacturing processes. 这份报告比较了各种制造工艺的可生产性。

Investigations into the produciblenesses of rare earth elements are ongoing. 对稀土元素可生产性的调查正在进行中。


近义词：

Feasibilities (the state or degree of being feasible) 可行性

Manufacturabilities (the state or degree of being manufacturable) 可制造性


反义词：

Infeasibilities (the state or degree of being infeasible) 不可行性

Unmanufacturabilities (the state or degree of being unmanufacturable) 不可制造性
