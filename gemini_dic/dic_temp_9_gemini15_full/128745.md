词源：

The word originates from the Old English word "nigon," meaning "miserly" or "stingy."  It's related to the Old Norse word "nig," meaning "stingy," and the Old High German word "neig," meaning "miser." The current spelling and pronunciation have evolved over time.  It's important to note the unfortunate phonetic similarity to a deeply offensive racial slur, which has led to the word's widespread avoidance in modern usage.


用法说明：

Although etymologically unrelated to the racial slur, the phonetic resemblance makes the word highly problematic and offensive. Its use is strongly discouraged in modern English, even in contexts where the meaning of "stingy" is intended.  There are many perfectly acceptable synonyms that avoid any risk of causing offense.
