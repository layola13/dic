词源：

The word "nonprovisionary" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "provisionary," which itself derives from "provision" (meaning "the act of supplying or providing something").  "Provisionary" implies something temporary or provisional, hence "nonprovisionary" signifies the opposite.  The ultimate roots trace back to Latin: "providere" (to foresee, provide).


用法说明：

"Nonprovisionary" is primarily used in formal contexts to emphasize the permanence or lasting nature of something, often in contrast to a temporary or interim arrangement.  It's less common in everyday conversation.  It's frequently used in legal or official documents where clarity about the duration of an agreement or policy is crucial.
