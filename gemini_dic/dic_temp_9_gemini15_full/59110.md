The word "dykier" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries or word databases.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a name, or a word specific to a particular dialect or community.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  To provide the requested information, a correct or at least a plausible word would be needed.
