nonassociatively: /ˌnɒnəˈsoʊʃieɪtɪvli/ | adv. | 非结合性地，非结合式地 |  Describes an operation where the order of operations matters; changing the grouping of operands alters the result.  This contrasts with associative operations where the grouping doesn't affect the outcome (e.g., addition: (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)). | Example:  Matrix multiplication is performed nonassociatively; (AB)C ≠ A(BC).  矩阵乘法是非结合性的；(AB)C ≠ A(BC). | 近义词: non-associative | 反义词: associatively


USAGE->
This word is an adverb, so it modifies verbs or clauses.  There aren't specific tenses to conjugate.  Instead, we show how it's used in sentences.

Example 3 (Illustrating contrast with associativity):
Associatively:  2 + (3 + 4) = (2 + 3) + 4 = 9
