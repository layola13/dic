词源:

The term "flash memory" is a compound word.  "Flash" refers to the speed and ease with which data can be written and erased (flashing).  "Memory" refers to its function as a data storage medium.  The technology itself originated from research in the late 1970s and early 1980s, primarily attributed to Fujio Masuoka at Toshiba.  The term evolved from the technology's characteristics.
