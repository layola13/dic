词源:
The word "perfusion" comes from the Latin word "perfundere," which means "to pour over, to pour through, to bathe."  The prefix "per-" means "through" and the root "-fundere" is related to the verb "fundere," meaning "to pour." Thus, "perfusion" literally describes the process of pouring a fluid through something.
