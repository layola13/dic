词源:
The word "overaffect" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "affect" (meaning "to influence" or "to pretend").  Therefore, it literally means "to influence too much" or "to pretend excessively."  The usage reflects a modern blending of the original meaning of affect with a more contemporary understanding of artificiality and exaggeration in behavior.
