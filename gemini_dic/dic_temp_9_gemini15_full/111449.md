The word "{llong}" is not a recognized English word.  There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries.  It's possible there's a typographical error, or it's a neologism (newly coined word), jargon specific to a certain field, or a misspelling.  Please double-check the spelling or provide more context.  I cannot provide an analysis following the requested format for a non-existent word.
