polyhedroid:/ˌpɒliˈhiːdrɔɪd/ | n. |多面体状物；多面体|A polyhedroid is a three-dimensional solid figure with many faces, often irregular or non-convex.  It's a generalization of a polyhedron, allowing for more complex shapes.  The term is less precise than "polyhedron" and is not as commonly used. |The sculpture resembled a complex polyhedroid, with facets of varying sizes and shapes.|近义词：polyhedron (more precise)|反义词：sphere (a single curved surface)

词源:
The word "polyhedroid" is formed from the Greek words "poly" (many), "hedra" (base, seat, face), and the suffix "-oid" (resembling, like).  It suggests a figure resembling a polyhedron but not necessarily conforming to the strict definitions of a polyhedron (which usually implies planar faces and convexity).
