crystallinities:/ˌkrɪstəˈlɪnɪtiz/| n. |结晶度，晶体度|The degree to which a substance is crystalline.  It refers to the proportion of crystalline regions within a material, such as a polymer or a solid.  A high crystallinity indicates a high degree of order in the molecular arrangement, while low crystallinity suggests a more amorphous or disordered structure.|例句：The crystallinities of the polyethylene samples were determined by X-ray diffraction.  聚乙烯样品的结晶度通过X射线衍射测定。|The crystallinity of this polymer is significantly affected by the cooling rate.  这种聚合物的结晶度受冷却速率影响很大。|amorphousness, order|amorphosity, disorder|名词
