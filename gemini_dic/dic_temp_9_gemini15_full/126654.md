词源:
The word "naked" comes from the Old English word "naced," meaning "bare, uncovered."  This, in turn, is related to the Proto-Germanic word "*nakadz," with the same meaning.  The ultimate origin is likely Proto-Indo-European "*h₂nek-," meaning "back, rear," which suggests a connection to the idea of being exposed or vulnerable.
