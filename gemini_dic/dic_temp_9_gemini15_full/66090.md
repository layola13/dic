词源:
The word "excavator" is derived from the verb "excavate," which comes from the Latin word "excavāre."  "Ex-" is a prefix meaning "out" or "from," and "cavāre" means "to hollow out" or "to dig."  Therefore, "excavate" literally means "to dig out." The suffix "-or" is added to form the noun "excavator," denoting the person or machine that performs the action of excavating.
