The word "fuggier" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a very uncommon neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage explanation are not possible.  To provide a helpful response, we need clarification:

1. **Is there a misspelling?**  Could it be a variation of another word?  Perhaps you meant "fugitive," "foggier," or a similar word?  Providing the context in which you encountered this word would be immensely helpful.

2. **Is it a neologism within a specific community or work?** If it's a newly coined term,  knowing the source would help understand its intended meaning and usage.


If you can provide more information, I can attempt a more accurate analysis.
