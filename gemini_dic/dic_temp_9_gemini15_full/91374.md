hydrosulphide: /ˈhaɪdrəʊsʌlfaɪd/ | n. | 硫氢化物 | A compound containing the HS⁻ ion.  Hydrosulfides are salts or esters of hydrosulfuric acid (H₂S). They are formed when one hydrogen atom of hydrogen sulfide is replaced by a metal or an organic group.  | Example: Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) is a common hydrosulfide used in various industrial processes. 钠硫氢化物(NaHS)是一种常用的硫氢化物，用于各种工业过程。|近义词：hydrogen sulfide salt, bisulfide | 反义词：N/A
