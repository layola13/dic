metamorphism:/ˌmɛtəˈmɔːrfɪzəm/ | n. | 变质作用；变形；蜕变 | The process of change in the form or nature of something or someone.  It often refers to the changes in rocks due to heat, pressure, or chemical reactions.  In biology, it refers to the transformation of a larva into an adult. | 例句：The intense heat and pressure caused the metamorphism of the sedimentary rock into marble.  高温高压导致沉积岩变质为大理石。

The caterpillar undergoes a complete metamorphism to become a butterfly. 毛虫经历完全变态变成蝴蝶。| 近义词：transformation, alteration, change | 反义词：stasis, permanence

USAGE->
一般现在时:
Metamorphism occurs deep within the Earth's crust. = 变质作用发生在地壳深处。
This process of metamorphism alters the rock's mineral composition. = 这种变质过程改变了岩石的矿物成分。


一般过去时:
The limestone metamorphosed into marble under intense pressure. = 石灰石在巨大压力下变质成大理石。
Geologists studied the metamorphic rocks to understand past geological events. = 地质学家研究变质岩以了解过去的地质事件。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the metamorphism of various rock types. = 科学家们已经研究了各种岩石类型的变质作用。
The region has undergone significant metamorphism due to tectonic activity. = 由于构造活动，该地区经历了显著的变质作用。


过去完成时:
Before the mountain building event, the rocks had already undergone significant metamorphism. = 在造山事件之前，岩石已经经历了显著的变质作用。
The pressure had already caused metamorphism in the surrounding rocks before the earthquake. = 地震发生前，压力已导致周围岩石发生变质作用。


将来时:
Further research will reveal more about the metamorphism of this rock formation. = 进一步的研究将揭示更多关于这种岩层变质作用的信息。
Geologists predict that the area will undergo further metamorphism in the future. = 地质学家预测该地区未来将经历进一步的变质作用。


虚拟语气:
If the temperature were higher, the metamorphism would be more intense. = 如果温度更高，变质作用将更加剧烈。
I wish I understood the complex processes involved in regional metamorphism. = 我希望我能理解区域变质作用中涉及的复杂过程。


被动语态:
The rock samples were subjected to experimental metamorphism in the laboratory. = 岩石样品在实验室中进行了实验性变质作用。
The metamorphic rocks are being studied to understand their origin. = 正在研究变质岩以了解它们的成因。


疑问句:
What type of metamorphism is responsible for this rock formation? = 导致这种岩层形成的是哪种类型的变质作用？
What are the key factors that influence metamorphic processes? = 影响变质过程的关键因素是什么？


否定句:
The rock did not undergo significant metamorphism during this geological period. = 在这个地质时期，岩石没有经历显著的变质作用。
This rock type does not exhibit characteristics of contact metamorphism. = 这种岩石类型不表现出接触变质作用的特征。


PHRASE->
regional metamorphism:区域变质作用
contact metamorphism:接触变质作用
dynamic metamorphism:动力变质作用
high-pressure metamorphism:高压变质作用
metamorphic grade:变质程度
