词源：
The word "recommendation" comes from the Middle English word "recomendacion," which itself comes from the Old French word "recomandacion."  The ultimate origin is the Latin word "recommendo," which means "to commend again" or "to entrust again."  The prefix "re-" means "again," and "commendo" is related to "commit" – implying a strong entrusting or advocating.
