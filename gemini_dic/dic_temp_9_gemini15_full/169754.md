词源:

The word "prorealism" is a relatively recent coinage, blending "pro" (suggesting "beyond" or "advanced") with "realism."  It reflects the art movement's aim to surpass traditional realism by employing advanced techniques and exploring themes beyond the strictly realistic.  Its precise origin is difficult to pinpoint, but its usage reflects a growing interest in art forms that push the boundaries of realism.
