词源:

The word "inexpediency" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the word "expediency" (meaning "the quality of being suitable or advantageous"), and the suffix "-cy" (forming nouns of quality or state).  "Expediency" itself comes from the Middle French "expedience" and ultimately from the Latin "expedire" (to extricate, to free, to expedite).  Therefore, "inexpediency" literally means "not being suitable or advantageous."
