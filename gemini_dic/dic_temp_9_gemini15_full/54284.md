词源:
The word "disguisers" is derived from the verb "disguise," which comes from the Old French word "desguiser," meaning "to disguise, to conceal."  This in turn likely comes from the prefix "des-" (meaning "to remove" or "to deprive of") and a root related to "guise," meaning "appearance" or "manner."  Therefore, the word's etymology points to its core meaning: to remove or alter one's true appearance.
