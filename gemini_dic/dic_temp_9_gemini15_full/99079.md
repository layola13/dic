interaxis: /ˌɪntərˈæksɪs/ | n. |轴间距，轴心距 |The distance between two axes or centers.  Specifically in crystallography, it refers to the distance between the centers of two adjacent units in a crystal lattice. |例句：The interaxis distance was carefully measured using X-ray diffraction.  X射线衍射法仔细测量了轴间距。|近义词：axial distance, interaxial distance |反义词：无 |名词
