词源:
The term "pigging" originates from the device used in the process, which is called a "pig".  This device, often made of polyurethane or other durable materials, is shaped and sized to fit within the pipeline. It's pushed through the pipeline by the pressure of the fluid being transported, cleaning or inspecting as it goes. The origin of the name "pig" is unclear, but likely reflects the device's cylindrical shape and its ability to "root" through the pipeline.
