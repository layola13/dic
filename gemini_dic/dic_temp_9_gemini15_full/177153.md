The word "rearbitrates" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism, possibly a misspelling or a newly coined word formed by combining "re-" (again) and "arbitrates" (decides a dispute).


Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  If you intended a different word, or have additional context where you encountered this word, please provide it for a proper analysis.
