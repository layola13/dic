词源:

The word comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of"), "en-" (meaning "to make" or "to cause to be"), "franchise" (meaning "a right or privilege"), and the suffix "-ment" (meaning "the act of" or "the state of").  Therefore, "disenfranchisement" literally means "the act of depriving someone of a right or privilege."  The root "franchise" itself originates from Old French "franchise," meaning "freedom, liberty."


用法说明:

Disenfranchisement is primarily used as a noun.  It typically refers to the systematic removal of rights, often political, from a group of people.  The context is usually one of injustice or oppression. It's not typically used in casual conversation.
