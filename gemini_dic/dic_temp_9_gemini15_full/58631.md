词源:
The word "dumbbell" is a compound word.  "Dumb" originally meant "stupid" or "mute," but in this context, it refers to the shape of the weight resembling a "dumb" or "mute" bell, possibly due to its lack of sound-producing capabilities compared to a ringing bell. "Bell" refers to the bell-like shape of the weights.  The combination evolved to refer to the exercise equipment.
