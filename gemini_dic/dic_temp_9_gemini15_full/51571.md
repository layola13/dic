deuterozooid:/ˈdɔɪtəroʊzɔɪd/| n. |次生个体；第二性个体|A deuterozooid is an individual produced asexually by budding or fission in a colonial organism, typically a bryozoan or hydrozoan.  It is a secondary zooid, distinct from the primary zooid (autozooid) from which it arises.  These individuals often have specialized functions within the colony, such as feeding or defense. |Example: The colony of bryozoans exhibited a clear polymorphism, with autozooids responsible for feeding and deuterozooids specializing in defense.|近义词：secondary zooid|反义词：autozooid
