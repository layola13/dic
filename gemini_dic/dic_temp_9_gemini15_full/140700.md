ommatidium:/ˌɒmətɪdiəm/| n. |小眼|A single unit of the compound eye of arthropods such as insects and crustaceans.  Each ommatidium contains a lens, several receptor cells, and pigment cells, and functions independently to detect light.  The combined output of many ommatidia creates a mosaic image. |例句：The dragonfly's compound eye is made up of thousands of ommatidia.  蜻蜓的复眼由数千个小眼组成。

The study of ommatidia provides insights into the visual processing capabilities of insects.  对小眼的学习提供了对昆虫视觉处理能力的见解。|近义词：facet (in the context of a compound eye), visual unit |反义词：无


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The insect's eye contains numerous ommatidia. = 昆虫的眼睛包含许多小眼。
Each ommatidium processes light independently. = 每个小眼独立地处理光线。


一般过去时:
Scientists studied the ommatidia of the bee. = 科学家研究了蜜蜂的小眼。
Researchers observed how the ommatidia functioned together. = 研究人员观察了小眼如何协同工作。

Scientists have learned much about insect vision through studying ommatidia. = 通过研究小眼，科学家们已经了解了很多关于昆虫视觉的知识。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had already examined the ommatidia under a microscope. = 在实验之前，他们已经在显微镜下检查了小眼。
They had discovered that the ommatidia were highly sensitive to movement. = 他们已经发现小眼对运动非常敏感。


将来时:
Scientists will continue to study the ommatidia to better understand insect vision. = 科学家们将继续研究小眼，以更好地了解昆虫的视觉。
Further research will reveal more about the complexities of the ommatidium. = 进一步的研究将揭示小眼的更多复杂性。


虚拟语气:
If the ommatidia were larger, the insect's vision might be better. = 如果小眼更大，昆虫的视力可能会更好。
It is hypothesized that if the pigment cells were different, the image would be altered. = 假设如果色素细胞不同，图像就会改变。


被动语态:

疑问句:
How many ommatidia are there in a fly's eye? = 一只苍蝇的眼睛里有多少个小眼？
What is the role of the pigment cells within the ommatidium? = 色素细胞在小眼中的作用是什么？


否定句:
The insect did not have a single, large eye; it had many ommatidia. = 昆虫没有一只大的眼睛; 它有很多小眼。
The experiment did not show a significant difference in the function of the ommatidia. = 实验没有显示小眼功能的显著差异。


PHRASE->
