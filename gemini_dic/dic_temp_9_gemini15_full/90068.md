词源:  The word "hostel" ultimately derives from the Old French word "hostel," meaning "inn" or "lodging."  This, in turn, comes from the Latin word "hospitale," meaning "guest house" or "hospital" (in the sense of a place of hospitality).  The modern English usage, focusing on budget-friendly shared accommodation, is a relatively recent development.
