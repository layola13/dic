neurula:/ˈnjʊərʊlə/| n. |神经胚|The neurula is the stage of embryonic development in vertebrates in which the neural tube is formed.  It is characterized by the process of neurulation, where the neural plate folds to form the neural tube, which will eventually develop into the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).  The neurula stage follows the gastrula stage and precedes the somite stage. | Example:  The neurula stage is a critical period in vertebrate embryogenesis.  神经胚阶段是脊椎动物胚胎发育中的一个关键时期。|近义词:embryo (in this specific developmental stage)|反义词:None specifically, but terms indicating later developmental stages could be considered antonyms.|名词
