词源:

The word "imperspicuity" is derived from the Latin prefix "im-" (meaning "not"), "per-" (meaning "through"), "spicere" (meaning "to look"), and "-uity" (a suffix indicating a quality or state).  Therefore, it literally means "not able to be looked through" or "not clearly seen."  It's the opposite of "perspicuity," which means clarity or intelligibility.


用法说明:

Imperspicuity is primarily used as a noun to describe the state or quality of something being unclear or difficult to understand. It's often used in formal writing to highlight the lack of clarity in a text, speech, or concept.  It is less common in everyday conversation.
