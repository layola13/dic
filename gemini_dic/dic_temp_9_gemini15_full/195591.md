Example 2:

词源:

The word is formed by combining:

* **semi-**:  A prefix meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."  Derived from Latin "semi-".
* **protectively**: An adverb derived from the adjective "protective," meaning "serving to protect."  "Protective" comes from "protect," which ultimately traces back to Old French "protegere" and Latin "protegere" (to protect, guard).
* **-ly**:  An adverbial suffix.
