词源:
The word "leeway" comes from the nautical term, meaning the sideways drift of a ship caused by wind or current.  It eventually evolved to its current meaning, referring to the freedom to deviate from a strict rule or plan.  The "lee" part comes from Old English "hlēo," meaning shelter or protection, referring to the side of a ship sheltered from the wind.  The "way" part refers to movement or direction.
