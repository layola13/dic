词源:  The word is a compound of "elf" and "-like," the suffix indicating resemblance.  "Elf" itself has Germanic origins, deriving from Old English *ælf, related to Old High German alb, and ultimately from a Proto-Germanic root meaning something akin to "supernatural being" or "spirit." The "-like" suffix is a common English suffix creating adjectives from nouns.
