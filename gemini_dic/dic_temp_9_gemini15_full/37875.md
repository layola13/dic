词源：

The word "complacency" comes from the Middle English word "complacence," which itself is derived from the Old French word "complaisance."  The Old French word ultimately comes from the Latin word "complacēre," meaning "to please," "to gratify," or "to be pleasing to." The shift in meaning from "pleasing" to "self-satisfied complacency" reflects a change in how the feeling of being pleased was perceived and understood over time.  The -cy suffix indicates a state or condition.
