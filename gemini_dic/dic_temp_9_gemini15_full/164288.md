The word "predwelt" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries or linguistic databases.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information following the requested format.  It is likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or fictional context.
