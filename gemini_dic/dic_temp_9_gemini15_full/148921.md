词源:
The word "overwinds" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "winds," which comes from the Old English word "windan," meaning "to turn," "to twist," or "to twine."  The sense of winding a clock spring or a similar mechanism is central to the etymology.  The extension to emotional "winding" is a metaphorical usage.
