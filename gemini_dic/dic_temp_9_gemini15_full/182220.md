词源:  The word "remontant" is derived from the French verb "remonter," meaning "to go up again," "to climb again," or "to rise again." In the context of roses, it refers to the plant's ability to "rise again" with new blooms after an initial flowering period.  This reflects the repeated flowering characteristic of remontant roses.
