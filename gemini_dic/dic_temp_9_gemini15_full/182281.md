词源:
The word "removing" comes from the verb "remove," which originates from the Old French word "remuer," meaning "to stir, move, agitate."  The prefix "re-" intensifies the action, implying a complete or thorough removal.  The "-ing" suffix indicates the present participle, showing an ongoing action.
