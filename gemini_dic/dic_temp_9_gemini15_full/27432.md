词源:
The word "camisole" comes from the French word "chemise," meaning "shirt."  The French word ultimately derives from the Latin word "camisia," also meaning "shirt."  Over time, "chemise" evolved in English to refer to both men's and women's undergarments, but the usage shifted, and "camisole" now primarily refers to a specific type of women's undergarment.
