词源:
The word "rarely" is derived from the adjective "rare," meaning "infrequent" or "uncommon."  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating manner or frequency.  The root of "rare" can be traced back to Old French "rare," and ultimately to Latin "rarus," meaning "thin," "scattered," or "widely spaced." This original meaning reflects the idea of something being thinly spread or infrequently occurring.
