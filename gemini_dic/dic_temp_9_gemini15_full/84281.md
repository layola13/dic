词源:
The word "half-timbered" combines "half," meaning partially, and "timbered," referring to the use of timber or wood in construction.  The term reflects the characteristic construction method where wooden beams are visible on the exterior, with infill material (such as brick or wattle and daub) filling the spaces between them.
