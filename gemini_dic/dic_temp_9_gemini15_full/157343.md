词源:The term "pipe dream" likely originated in the late 19th or early 20th century.  While the exact etymology is unclear, it's believed to refer to the hazy, often drug-induced visions experienced by opium smokers who used pipes. These visions were often unrealistic and fantastical, hence the association with unrealistic hopes and plans.  The use of the word "pipe" may also be linked to the idea of something being "smoked" or blown away, implying that a pipe dream is easily dismissed as unrealistic.
