photons:/ˈfoʊtɑːnz/ | n. | 光子 | A photon is a fundamental particle of light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation. It is a quantum of energy, meaning it exists in discrete packets.  Photons have no mass and always travel at the speed of light. | Example:  Sunlight is composed of countless photons.  阳光是由无数光子组成的。|  近义词：quantum, light particle | 反义词：N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Photons travel at the speed of light. = 光子以光速传播。
The sun emits photons constantly. = 太阳不断地发出光子。


一般过去时:
Scientists discovered the photon in the early 20th century. = 科学家在20世纪初发现了光子。
The experiment measured the energy of individual photons. = 实验测量了单个光子的能量。


现在完成时:
Physicists have studied photons extensively. = 物理学家们已经广泛研究了光子。
We have observed the wave-particle duality of photons. = 我们已经观察到了光子的波粒二象性。


过去完成时:
Before Einstein's work, the nature of photons was poorly understood. = 在爱因斯坦的工作之前，人们对光子的性质知之甚少。
They had already established the quantum nature of light before the experiment. = 在实验之前，他们已经确定了光的量子性质。


将来时:
Researchers will continue to study the properties of photons. = 研究人员将继续研究光子的特性。
We will use photons to improve communication technology. = 我们将利用光子来改进通信技术。


虚拟语气:
If photons had mass, the universe would be different. = 如果光子有质量，宇宙将会不同。
I wish I understood quantum mechanics better to explain photons. = 我希望我更了解量子力学来解释光子。


被动语态:
Photons are emitted by excited atoms. = 光子是由激发的原子发射出来的。
The properties of photons are being studied intensively. = 光子的特性正在被深入研究。


疑问句:
How many photons are emitted by a laser? = 激光器发射多少光子？
What is the wavelength of these photons? = 这些光子的波长是多少？


否定句:
Photons do not have electric charge. = 光子没有电荷。
The experiment did not detect any photons. = 实验没有检测到任何光子。


PHRASE->
photon energy = 光子能量
photon emission = 光子发射
photon scattering = 光子散射
photon detector = 光子探测器
single photon = 单光子
