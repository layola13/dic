/ˌnɒnˌdʒɛnəˈreɪʃənz/ | n. | 非退化；非简并 | The absence of degeneracy; a state or condition in which a system or mathematical object does not exhibit degeneracy.  This often refers to situations where multiple solutions or states are not equivalent or indistinguishable.  For example, in linear algebra, a nondegenerate matrix is one with a non-zero determinant, implying that its eigenvalues are distinct. In physics, it often describes systems where energy levels are distinct. |  The nondegenerations of the energy levels are crucial for the stability of the system.  能量级的非简并性对于系统的稳定性至关重要。 The mathematical model assumed nondegenerations of the solutions. 数学模型假设解是非简并的。 |  degeneracies | degeneracies |
