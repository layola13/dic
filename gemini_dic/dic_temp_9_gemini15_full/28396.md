carbon-dating:/ˈkɑːrbənˌdeɪtɪŋ/| n. |碳定年法，放射性碳定年法 |A scientific method used to determine the age of an object containing organic material by using the properties of radiocarbon (carbon-14).  It's based on the decay rate of carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon. |Example: Carbon-dating revealed that the ancient artifact was over 5,000 years old.  碳定年法显示这件古代文物已有5000多年的历史。|近义词：radiocarbon dating |反义词:  (无直接反义词，但相对的概念可以是“直接测年法”等)|名词
