词源:

The word "rakish" ultimately derives from "rake," meaning a dissolute or immoral person, especially one who is sexually promiscuous.  The adjective form, "rakish," then adopted the sense of suggesting the qualities associated with such a person – a carefree, somewhat reckless, and stylishly unconventional demeanor.  The connection to the tool "rake" is etymologically distant and largely coincidental.
