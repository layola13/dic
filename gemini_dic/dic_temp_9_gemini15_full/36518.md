colinear:/koʊˈlɪniər/ | adj. | 共线的，共点的 |  Lying on the same straight line.  Describes points, lines, or vectors that are situated on the same straight line.  | Example: The three points are colinear. 这三个点是共线的。 The vectors are colinear. 这些向量是共线的。 |近义词：collinear, aligned, straight |反义词：non-colinear, skew


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The points are colinear. = 这些点是共线的。
The lines are colinear. = 这些线是共线的。


一般过去时:
The points were colinear. = 这些点是共线的。
The lines were colinear. = 这些线是共线的。


现在完成时:
The points have been colinear. = 这些点一直是共线的。
The lines have been colinear. = 这些线一直是共线的。


过去完成时:
The points had been colinear. = 这些点曾经是共线的。
The lines had been colinear. = 这些线曾经是共线的。


将来时:
The points will be colinear. = 这些点将是共线的。
The lines will be colinear. = 这些线将是共线的。


虚拟语气:
If the points were colinear, the problem would be simpler. = 如果这些点是共线的，问题就会简单得多。
I wish the lines were colinear. = 我希望这些线是共线的。


被动语态:
It was determined that the points were colinear. = 确定这些点是共线的。
The colinearity of the lines was proven. = 这些线的共线性得到了证明。


疑问句:
Are the points colinear? = 这些点是共线的吗？
Are the lines colinear? = 这些线是共线的吗？


否定句:
The points are not colinear. = 这些点不是共线的。
The lines are not colinear. = 这些线不是共线的。


PHRASE->
colinear points = 共线点
colinear vectors = 共线向量
colinearity test = 共线性检验
colinearity of points = 点的共线性
demonstrate colinearity = 证明共线性
