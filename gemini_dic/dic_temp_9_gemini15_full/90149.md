词源:  The word "hotelless" is a straightforward compound word formed by combining "hotel" and the suffix "-less," which indicates the absence or lack of something.  "Hotel" comes from the Old French "hostel," ultimately derived from the Latin "hospitale," meaning "guest house" or "place of hospitality."  The "-less" suffix is of Germanic origin.
