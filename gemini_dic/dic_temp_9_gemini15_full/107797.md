词源:
The word "lap" comes from the Old English word "lappe," meaning "a fold of cloth" or "the loose part of a garment."  This sense evolved to refer to the area around the lap, and from there to the action of wrapping or enfolding. The sense of "to drink with the tongue," as in a dog lapping water, is a later development.  The sense of a circuit or round is linked to the idea of something going around an area, like a track.
