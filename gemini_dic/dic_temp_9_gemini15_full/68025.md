词源:  The word "factorial" comes from the Latin word "facere," meaning "to make" or "to do," combined with the suffix "-ial," indicating a relationship or characteristic.  The mathematical concept arose from the study of permutations and combinations, where the factorial represents the number of ways to arrange a set of objects.
