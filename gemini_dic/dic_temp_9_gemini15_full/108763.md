词源:

The word "leary" likely originates from the Irish Gaelic word "leathar" meaning "leather," which was associated with the protective quality of leather.  However, the connection is tenuous and the exact etymology is uncertain.  The current meaning developed in American English, particularly among African American communities in the early to mid-20th century.  It's possible the word evolved through a semantic shift, its cautious connotation perhaps reflecting a distrust of potentially dangerous situations.
