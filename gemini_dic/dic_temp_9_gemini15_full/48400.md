词源:

The adverb "dedicatedly" is derived from the adjective "dedicated," which in turn comes from the verb "dedicate."  "Dedicate" originates from the Latin word "dēdicāre," which combines "dē-" (meaning "down," "away," or "completely") and "dicāre" (meaning "to proclaim," "to declare," or "to announce").  Therefore, the original meaning implied a formal act of setting something apart or assigning it to a specific purpose.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the sense of commitment and devotion.
