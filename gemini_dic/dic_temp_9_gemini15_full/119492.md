microparasite:/ˌmaɪkroʊˈpærəsaɪt/| n. |微寄生虫|A microparasite is a parasite that is small in size and usually multiplies within the host, often leading to high densities of parasites within the host's body.  They typically cause acute infections and often spread rapidly through populations. Examples include viruses, bacteria, and some protozoa.|例句：The rapid spread of the influenza virus is an example of a microparasite infection.  流感病毒的迅速传播是微寄生虫感染的一个例子。  Many microparasites rely on vectors to transmit themselves between hosts. 许多微寄生虫依靠媒介在宿主之间传播自身。|近义词：parasite, pathogen |反义词：macroparasite
