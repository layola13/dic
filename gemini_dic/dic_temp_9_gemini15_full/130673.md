过去完成时:
They had already identified the bacteria as nonaerobic before the experiment. = 他们在实验前就已经确定该细菌是厌氧菌。
Scientists had believed the reaction to be aerobic, but later found it was nonaerobic. = 科学家们曾认为该反应是有氧的，但后来发现它是无氧的。


将来时:
We will study the nonaerobic metabolism of this organism. = 我们将研究这种生物体的无氧代谢。
They will investigate the impact of oxygen on nonaerobic growth. = 他们将研究氧气对无氧生长的影响。


虚拟语气:
If the environment were completely nonaerobic, the bacteria would thrive. = 如果环境完全无氧，细菌就会茁壮成长。

疑问句:
Is this bacterial culture nonaerobic? = 这种细菌培养物是无氧的吗？
Are these conditions suitable for nonaerobic growth? = 这些条件适合无氧生长吗？


否定句:
The reaction is not nonaerobic; it requires oxygen. = 该反应不是无氧的；它需要氧气。
The bacteria are not entirely nonaerobic; they can tolerate some oxygen. = 这些细菌并非完全厌氧；它们可以耐受一些氧气。
