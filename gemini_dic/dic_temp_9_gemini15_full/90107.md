词源:

The word "hot-bloodedness" is a compound word.  "Hot-blooded" combines "hot" (meaning passionate, excited) and "blooded" (referring to temperament or nature, originating from the older notion of blood's role in determining personality). The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "hot-blooded" into a noun, indicating the state or quality of being hot-blooded.  The concept of associating blood with temperament has ancient roots, found in various cultures and historical medical theories (e.g., the four humors).
