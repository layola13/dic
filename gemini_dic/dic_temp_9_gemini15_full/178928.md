The word "redebates" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism, possibly a misspelling or a newly coined word formed by combining "re-" (again) and "debates" (discusses).  Therefore, a full analysis in the requested format is impossible.  To provide a response, I would need a valid English word.
