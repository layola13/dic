词源:
The word "imprisonment" comes from the Old French word "emprisonement," which is a combination of the prefix "en-" (meaning "in") and "prison" (meaning "prison").  The word "prison" itself has roots in the Latin word "prehensio," meaning "seizure" or "capture." Therefore, "imprisonment" literally means "the act of being seized or captured and held in prison."
