grammatication:/ˌɡræmətɪˈkeɪʃən/ | n. | 语法化 | The process by which words or phrases acquire grammatical function.

For example, a word originally used as a noun might become a grammatical particle or auxiliary verb. | Example: The grammatication of "going to" to express future tense is a well-studied example.  The phrase originally meant physical movement but evolved to indicate future intention. | 近义词：grammaticalization | 反义词：None directly applicable.
