hydrofluorocarbons:/ˌhaɪdroʊˌflʊərəˈkɑːrbənz/| n. |氢氟烃|Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are chemical compounds containing hydrogen, fluorine, and carbon. They are used as refrigerants, propellants, and solvents.  HFCs are potent greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change.  However, they have a lower global warming potential than chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) which they replaced. |The refrigerator uses hydrofluorocarbons as a refrigerant.  这台冰箱使用氢氟烃作为制冷剂。|近义词：refrigerants, propellants|反义词：N/A
