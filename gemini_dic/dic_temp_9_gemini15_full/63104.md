词源:
The word "enshroud" comes from the Old English "scrūd," meaning "clothing," "garment," or "dress," and the prefix "en-," meaning "to put into" or "to cover with."  Thus, "enshroud" literally meant to clothe or cover something completely.  Over time, the meaning evolved to include the sense of mystery and secrecy associated with covering something.
