The word "schorly" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis following the requested format.  To help, I need clarification on the intended word.  Is it a possible misspelling of a known word?  If it's a neologism, could you provide context where you encountered it?
