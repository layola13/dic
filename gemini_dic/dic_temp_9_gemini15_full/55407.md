disthene:/ˈdɪsθiːn/| n.|蓝晶石|A blue to bluish-green, sometimes colorless, metamorphic mineral consisting of aluminum borosilicate.  It's a relatively hard mineral, often found in metamorphic rocks. Disthene is a variety of kyanite, characterized by its distinct pleochroism (showing different colors when viewed from different directions).|Example: The geologist identified the sample as disthene due to its characteristic pleochroism and hardness.|近义词：kyanite (though disthene is a variety of kyanite)|反义词：无|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The sample shows disthene's characteristic pleochroism. = 样本显示了蓝晶石的特征多色性。
Disthene is a metamorphic mineral. = 蓝晶石是一种变质矿物。


一般过去时:
Geologists discovered disthene deposits in the region. = 地质学家在该地区发现了蓝晶石矿床。
We examined the disthene under a microscope. = 我们在显微镜下检查了蓝晶石。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several varieties of disthene. = 科学家们已经鉴定了几种蓝晶石变种。
The research team has analyzed the disthene sample's chemical composition. = 研究小组分析了蓝晶石样品的化学成分。


过去完成时:
They had already studied disthene before the conference. = 他们在会议之前就已经研究过蓝晶石了。
The geologists had collected several disthene specimens. = 地质学家们已经收集了几个蓝晶石标本。


将来时:
Researchers will further investigate the properties of disthene. = 研究人员将进一步研究蓝晶石的特性。
We will analyze the disthene sample using X-ray diffraction. = 我们将使用X射线衍射法分析蓝晶石样品。


虚拟语气:
If this were disthene, it would show pleochroism. = 如果这是蓝晶石，它就会显示多色性。
I wish I had more disthene samples for analysis. = 我希望我有更多蓝晶石样本来分析。


被动语态:
The disthene sample was analyzed using various techniques. = 蓝晶石样品是用各种技术分析的。
Disthene is often found in metamorphic rocks. = 蓝晶石通常存在于变质岩中。


疑问句:
Is this mineral disthene? = 这种矿物是蓝晶石吗？
What are the distinguishing features of disthene? = 蓝晶石的显著特征是什么？


否定句:
This is not disthene; it's a different mineral. = 这不是蓝晶石；它是一种不同的矿物。
The sample did not exhibit the typical pleochroism of disthene. = 样本没有表现出蓝晶石典型的多色性。


PHRASE->
disthene crystal = 蓝晶石晶体
disthene deposits = 蓝晶石矿床
disthene inclusion = 蓝晶石包裹体
disthene structure = 蓝晶石结构
disthene properties = 蓝晶石特性
