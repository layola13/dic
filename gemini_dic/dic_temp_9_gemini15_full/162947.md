The word "prechooses" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need to consider what the intended word might be.  It seems to be a combination of "pre-" (meaning before) and "chooses," suggesting a word that might mean "chooses in advance" or "selects beforehand."

Let's explore possible intended words and their analyses:

**Possibility 1:  Preselects**

**Possibility 2:  Pre-chooses (hyphenated)**

This would function similarly to "preselects," but emphasizes the act of choosing *before* something else. The hyphen indicates a compound adjective modifying a verb.  The grammatical analysis would remain largely the same as above.  The meaning is still "chooses in advance."


Without knowing the intended context, it's difficult to provide a more precise analysis.  If you can provide the sentence where you encountered "prechooses," I can offer a more accurate interpretation and analysis.
