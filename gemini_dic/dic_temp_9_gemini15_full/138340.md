This word is an adverb and doesn't have different tenses like verbs.  It describes the manner in which an action is performed.

PHRASE->
Because "nothingly" is an adverb, it doesn't typically form common phrases in the same way verbs or nouns do.  It's used to modify verbs, describing how an action is done.  Examples of phrases using it would be:

例句1: completely nothingly (完全无效地)
例句2: almost nothingly (几乎无效地)
例句3: utterly nothingly (彻底无效地)
例句4: relatively nothingly (相对无效地)
例句5: pointlessly nothingly (毫无意义地)


There is no readily available etymology for "nothingly" as it's a relatively uncommon word. It's formed from "nothing" (meaning absence of something) and the adverbial suffix "-ly," signifying manner or way.  Therefore, its meaning is derived directly from its constituent parts.
