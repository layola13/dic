USAGE->

PHRASE->
It's not typically used in phrases, but can be used in exclamations like: "Poppycock!" or "Pure poppycock!"

WORD ORIGIN->
The origin of "poppycock" is uncertain, but the most accepted theory connects it to a Low German word, *pappekak*, referring to a type of soft, tasteless food. The association might be that the speech is considered as bland, unnutritious and meaningless as the food. Another less accepted theory is that it may derive from the Dutch word *pappekak*, "soft dung".  In either case, the implied meaning is something worthless and insignificant.
