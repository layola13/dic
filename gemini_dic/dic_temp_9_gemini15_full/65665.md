The word "evasivenesses" is the plural form of "evasiveness," which itself is derived from the adjective "evasive."

**Etymology:**

* **Evasive:**  From the verb "evade," ultimately from Old French *evader* (to escape, avoid), from Latin *evadere* (to escape, get out of).  The suffix "-ive" forms adjectives indicating a tendency or capacity.
* **Evasiveness:** The suffix "-ness" forms nouns indicating a state, quality, or condition.
* **Evasivenesses:**  The addition of "-es" forms the plural.

**Usage:**

Evasivenesses refer to instances or examples of evasive behavior or speech.  It describes the repeated or multiple acts of avoiding a direct answer or clear explanation.  The word is relatively uncommon, with "evasiveness" being more frequently used.

**Examples:**

* **His evasivenesses during the interview made it difficult to determine the truth.** 他在采访中的闪烁其词使得难以确定真相。
