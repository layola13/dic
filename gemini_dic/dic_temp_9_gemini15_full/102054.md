isomeromorphism:/ˌaɪˌsɒməˈmɔːrfɪzəm/|/ˌaɪˌsɑːməˈmɔːrfɪzəm/| n. |同构异构体|Isomeromorphism refers to a structural similarity between two molecules or systems despite differences in their chemical composition or connectivity.  It implies that they share a common underlying structure or pattern, even if the specific atoms or bonds are different.  This concept is often used in chemistry and graph theory. | Example:  Two molecules might exhibit isomeromorphism if they have the same number of atoms and bonds arranged in a similar spatial configuration, but differ in the types of atoms involved. |近义词：structural analogy, structural similarity |反义词：structural dissimilarity, non-isomorphism
