词源:

The word "irresponsibleness" is derived from the adjective "irresponsible" and the suffix "-ness," which is used to form nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.  "Irresponsible" itself is formed from the prefix "ir-" (meaning "not"), "responsible" (meaning "able to be held accountable"), and the suffix "-ible" (forming adjectives).  Ultimately, it traces back to the Latin word "responsus," meaning "answer" or "reply," highlighting the connection between responsibility and being accountable for one's actions.
