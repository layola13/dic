词源:
The word "canola" is a portmanteau of "Canada" and "oil," reflecting its origin and primary use.  It was created as a marketing term to distance the product from the negative connotations associated with "rapeseed oil," due to the presence of erucic acid in some rapeseed varieties.  Modern canola varieties have been genetically modified to have low levels of erucic acid, making the oil suitable for human consumption.
