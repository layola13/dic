preoffensivenesses: /ˌpriːəˈfɛnsɪvnəsɪz/ | n. |  冒犯性行为（复数） | The word "preoffensivenesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, formed by adding the prefix "pre-" to "offensivenesses," which is itself the plural of "offensiveness."  The intended meaning is likely actions or statements that are potentially offensive *before* they are actually uttered or committed.  However, its lack of common usage makes it unclear and potentially confusing.  There is no established dictionary definition. |  例句：The committee debated the potential preoffensivenesses of the proposed advertisement before its release. (委员会在广告发布前讨论了其潜在的冒犯性行为。) | 近义词: potential offenses, potential insults, potential provocations | 反义词:  compliments, courtesies, acts of kindness |  名词
