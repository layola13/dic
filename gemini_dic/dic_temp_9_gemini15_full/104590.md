The word "Kantian" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a proper noun derived from the philosopher Immanuel Kant.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full lexical entry as requested.  However, if you meant "Kantian," referring to the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, I can offer information.
