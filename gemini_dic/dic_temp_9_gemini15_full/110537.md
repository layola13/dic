limekiln:/ˈlaɪmˌkɪlən/| n. |石灰窑|A lime kiln is a structure used for the production of quicklime (calcium oxide) by the thermal decomposition of limestone (calcium carbonate).  The process involves heating limestone to a high temperature, typically in the range of 900-1200°C (1652-2192°F), to drive off carbon dioxide. The resulting quicklime is then used in various applications, including construction, agriculture, and industry. |The old limekiln stood silent, a testament to a bygone era.  古老的石灰窑静静地矗立着，见证着过去的时代。
