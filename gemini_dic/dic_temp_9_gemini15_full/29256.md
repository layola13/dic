cassinian:/kæˈsɪniən/| n. |卡西尼曲线；卡西尼卵形线|A Cassini oval is a plane curve defined as the set of points such that the product of the distances to two fixed points is constant.  It's a generalization of an ellipse, which is a special case where the constant product is the square of the distance between the foci.  The shape varies depending on the value of the constant and the distance between the foci.  When the constant is smaller than the square of the half the distance between the foci, the curve has two separate loops. When the constant is equal to the square of half the distance, the curve is shaped like a figure eight. When it is larger, it is a single loop. |The image shows a family of Cassini ovals.  Each oval is defined by a different constant product of distances. |近义词：oval (in certain cases) |反义词：无
