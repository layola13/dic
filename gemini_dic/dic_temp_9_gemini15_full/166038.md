preplacental: /ˌpriːpleɪˈsɛntəl/ | adj. | 胎盘前的，着床前的 | Relating to the period before the placenta is formed in a pregnancy.  This term describes the developmental stage of an embryo before the placenta fully develops and takes over the role of providing nutrients and oxygen.  | Example:  Preplacental development is a critical stage in embryonic growth.  胎盘前发育是胚胎发育的关键阶段。 | 近义词:  anteplacental (less common) | 反义词: placental | 词性:形容词
