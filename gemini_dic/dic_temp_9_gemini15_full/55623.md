The word "disworkmanship" is not a standard or commonly used word in the English language.  It's likely a newly coined word or a very rare archaic term.  There is no established entry for it in major dictionaries or corpora.  It appears to be formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "lack of") to "workmanship,"  attempting to create a word meaning "lack of good workmanship" or "poor workmanship."

However, since it's not a recognized word, providing a full grammatical breakdown as requested in the example format is not possible.  The analysis would be based on a hypothetical understanding of its intended meaning rather than established usage.

Instead of using "disworkmanship,"  it's recommended to use established synonyms like "poor workmanship," "bad craftsmanship," "shoddy work," or "inferior quality" to convey the intended meaning.
