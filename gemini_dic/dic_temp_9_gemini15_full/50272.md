词源:
From de- + phlegm + -ate.  "Phlegm" comes from the Greek  φλέγμα (phlegma), meaning "phlegm, inflammation." The suffix "-ate" indicates to make or cause to be.  Therefore, "dephlegmate" literally means "to remove phlegm."  The modern usage has broadened to encompass the removal of impurities generally.
