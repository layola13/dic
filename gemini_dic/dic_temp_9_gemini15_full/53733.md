词源：

The word "discoherent" is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the adjective "coherent."  "Coherent" ultimately derives from the Latin word "cohaerere," meaning "to stick together,"  combining "co-" (together) and "haerere" (to stick). Thus, "discoherent" means "not sticking together," referring to a lack of connection or consistency.


用法说明:

discoherent主要用作形容词，修饰名词，例如：speech, argument, essay, thought, idea等等，表示这些事物缺乏连贯性、一致性或组织性。


注意：discoherent是一个相对较少使用的词语，在正式写作中使用更常见。在口语中，incoherent更为常用。
