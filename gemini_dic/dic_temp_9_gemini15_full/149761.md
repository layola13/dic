词源:

The word "palatialness" is derived from the adjective "palatial," which in turn comes from the noun "palace."  "Palace" traces its roots back to the Old French word "palais," ultimately originating from the Latin word "palatium," referring to the Palatine Hill in Rome, where emperors had their residences.  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun signifying the state or quality of being palatial.
