词源:  The word "interjector" comes from the verb "interject," which is formed from the Latin prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and the verb "jacere" (meaning "to throw").  Therefore, "interject" literally means "to throw in between," accurately reflecting the action of inserting a word or phrase into a conversation.  The "-or" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, signifying a person or thing that performs the action.
