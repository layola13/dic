词源:
The term "shovel-ready" is a relatively recent coinage, arising in the context of government spending on infrastructure projects. It combines the image of a shovel (a tool used for digging and beginning construction) with the idea of readiness, emphasizing the immediate commencement of work.  The term gained prominence during the economic stimulus debates in the early 2000s, especially in the United States.
