overjudiciousnesses:/ˌoʊvərˌdʒuːdɪˈʃəs.nə.sɪz/| n. |过分谨慎的行为；过度审慎的表现|Excessive caution or prudence; instances of being overly careful or meticulous.  This word is extremely rare and largely theoretical; it's unlikely to be encountered in everyday usage. The word is formed by adding "-nesses" (a pluralizing suffix indicating multiple instances or qualities) to "overjudicious," which itself is formed from "over-" (excessive) + "judicious" (showing good judgment).|例句：His overjudiciousnesses prevented him from taking any risks, ultimately hindering his career.  他的过度谨慎阻碍了他冒险，最终妨碍了他的事业。


The extreme rarity of this word makes providing further examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usages impractical.  Its meaning is entirely derived from the component parts, and it doesn't have established idiomatic or phrasal applications.  The word is essentially a contrived formation rather than one with established usage.


There are no readily available near synonyms or antonyms because of the word's extreme rarity and highly specific meaning.  Instead of using this word, one would typically use phrases describing the excessive caution or prudence, such as:


* Excessive caution
* Overly meticulous behavior
* Unnecessary prudence
* Hypervigilance (in certain contexts)
* Paralysis by analysis

The grammatical usages would follow standard rules for plural nouns.  For example:

* **General Statement:** His overjudiciousnesses were evident in every decision. (他的过度谨慎在每一个决定中都显而易见。)
* **Possessive:**  The committee's overjudiciousnesses delayed the project. (委员会的过度谨慎延误了项目。)


Because the word is so unusual, creating a full grammatical analysis like that provided in the example for "what" is not feasible or useful.
