词源:
The word "deaf" has Old English origins, stemming from the Proto-Germanic *deuf- and ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European root *dheu-, meaning "to blow, swell, puff." This is believed to connect to the sense of being "deaf" because the perception of sound involves vibrations and pressure waves, and this root word connects to that pressure concept.  The modern English word evolved through various stages of Old English (deaf, deof) and Middle English (def).
