impendence:/ɪmˈpɛndəns/| n.|阻抗|Impedance is the measure of the opposition that a circuit presents to a current when a voltage is applied.  It's a complex quantity, combining resistance and reactance (the opposition to current due to capacitance and inductance).|The impedance of the circuit was too high, resulting in a weak signal.|resistance, reactance|conductance|名词


USAGE->
This word is a noun and doesn't conjugate like verbs.  Therefore, tense changes are not applicable.  The following examples demonstrate usage in different sentence structures.


Simple Sentence:
The high impedance of the speaker reduced the audio quality. = 扬声器的高阻抗降低了音频质量。

Complex Sentence:
Because the impedance was too high, the signal was attenuated, resulting in a faint sound. = 由于阻抗过高，信号衰减，导致声音微弱。



PHRASE->
There aren't common idiomatic phrases directly using "impedance".  The usage is primarily technical within the fields of electronics and physics.  Related phrases might include:

High impedance input = 高阻抗输入
Low impedance output = 低阻抗输出
Characteristic impedance = 特性阻抗
Input impedance = 输入阻抗
Output impedance = 输出阻抗
