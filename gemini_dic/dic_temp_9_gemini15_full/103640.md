词源:
The word "joker" originates from the 16th century, derived from the verb "to joke," meaning to jest or make lighthearted remarks.  The association with playing cards came later, likely because the extra cards (jokers) added an element of unpredictability and surprise to the game, similar to a person who makes jokes.
