词源:
The word "exert" comes from the Old French word "exert," meaning "to put forth," which itself comes from the Latin word "exertus," the past participle of "exertus," meaning "pushed out" or "raised."  The Latin prefix "ex-" means "out" or "from," and the Latin verb "ertus" is related to the verb "regere," meaning "to rule" or "to guide."  Thus, the original meaning is inherently about putting forth effort or influence.
