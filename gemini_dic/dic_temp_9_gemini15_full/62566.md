词源:
The word "energize" comes from the word "energy," which itself is derived from the Greek word "energeia," meaning "activity," "operation," or "work in action."  The suffix "-ize" is a common verb-forming suffix that indicates "to make" or "to become." Therefore, "energize" literally means "to make full of energy" or "to become energetic."
