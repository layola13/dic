The word "extradictionary" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  It's likely a newly coined word, a misspelling, or a word used within a specific context (e.g., jargon, neologism).

To provide a helpful response, we need clarification.  Is this a made-up word? If so, what is its intended meaning?  Or is there a typo?  Please provide more context.


If you intended a different word, please provide the correct spelling.  I can then offer the analysis as requested in the format you specified.
