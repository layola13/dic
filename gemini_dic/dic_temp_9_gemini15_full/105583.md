词源:  The word "kindler" is derived from the verb "kindle," which comes from the Old English word "cyndelan," meaning "to ignite, to set on fire."  The sense of "to inspire" or "to arouse" developed later. The "-er" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, denoting someone or something that performs the action of kindling.
