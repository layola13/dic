jump-cut:/ˈdʒʌmp kʌt/| n. |跳跃剪辑|A jump cut is an abrupt transition between shots that is jarring because it seems to skip a portion of time and/or space.  It's often used for stylistic effect, to create a sense of discontinuity or disorientation, or to compress time.  Unlike a standard cut, it doesn't follow the principles of continuity editing. |Example: The film used jump cuts to portray the protagonist's disintegrating mental state.  这部电影用跳跃剪辑来描绘主人公日渐崩溃的精神状态。  The rapid jump cuts created a frenetic pace in the action sequence. 快速的跳跃剪辑在动作场景中营造出一种狂热的速度。|近义词：abrupt cut, discontinuous edit |反义词：smooth cut, continuous edit
