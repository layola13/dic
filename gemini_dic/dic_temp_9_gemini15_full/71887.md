词源：
The term "fleur-de-lis" is French, literally meaning "flower of the lily."  While often depicted as a lily, its exact botanical origin is debated.  Its use as a royal symbol in France dates back to the 12th century, and its stylized form evolved over time.  The three petals are generally considered to represent the Holy Trinity.
