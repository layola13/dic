The word "eeld" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  There is no pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage to provide.  It's possible that:

1. It's a misspelling:  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please double-check your spelling.  Perhaps you meant "eel," "eld," or a similar word.

2. It's a neologism or slang:  It might be a newly coined word, a word used within a specific community or context, or slang not yet widely recognized.  If this is the case, more information about the source would be needed to explain it.

3. It's a proper noun:  It could be a name, place, or brand.  Again, more context is needed.

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you'd like assistance.
