nonconverging: /ˌnɒnkənˈvɜːdʒɪŋ/ | adj. | 不收敛的，发散的 | Not converging; diverging or spreading out.  Describes a process or series that does not approach a limit or a single point.  | Example: The nonconverging series of numbers continued to grow indefinitely.  不收敛的数字序列无限增长。  | 近义词：diverging, spreading, dispersing | 反义词：converging, concentrating


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The algorithm shows a nonconverging pattern. = 算法显示出不收敛的模式。
The series of numbers is nonconverging. = 这个数字序列是不收敛的。


一般过去时:
The iterative process remained nonconverging. = 迭代过程仍然不收敛。
The simulation produced a nonconverging result. = 模拟产生了一个不收敛的结果。


现在完成时:
The system has remained nonconverging despite adjustments. = 尽管进行了调整，系统仍然没有收敛。
The research has shown that the method is nonconverging in certain conditions. = 研究表明，该方法在某些条件下是不收敛的。


过去完成时:
The calculation had already become nonconverging before the error was detected. = 在检测到错误之前，计算已经变得不收敛了。
The model had been nonconverging for several iterations. = 该模型已经不收敛好几次迭代了。


将来时:
The optimization algorithm will likely remain nonconverging unless modified. = 除非修改，否则优化算法可能会仍然不收敛。
The trajectory will be nonconverging without proper control. = 没有适当的控制，轨迹将不收敛。


虚拟语气:
If the initial conditions were different, the solution might be nonconverging. = 如果初始条件不同，解可能不收敛。
If the parameters were not properly set, the results would be nonconverging. = 如果参数设置不当，结果将不收敛。


被动语态:
The problem was identified as being nonconverging. = 问题被确定为不收敛。
The data was shown to be nonconverging in the analysis. = 分析表明数据不收敛。


疑问句:
Is the iterative process nonconverging? = 迭代过程不收敛吗？
Are the results of the simulation nonconverging? = 模拟的结果不收敛吗？


否定句:
The method is not nonconverging; it eventually converges. = 该方法并非不收敛；它最终会收敛。
The sequence is not nonconverging; it approaches a limit. = 该序列并非不收敛；它趋于一个极限。
