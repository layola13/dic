The word "nouthe" is not a recognized word in standard English.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* **A neologism:** A newly coined word not yet included in dictionaries.  If this is the case, please provide context for its usage.
* **A word from a specific dialect or jargon:**  If this is the case, please specify the dialect or field.

Please provide more information or the correct spelling so I can help.
