hyperintellectualnesses:/ˌhaɪpərɪnˌtɛləkˈtʃuəlˌnɛsɪz/| n.|过分知识分子气; 过度智力;  智力过剩的表现|The word "hyperintellectualnesses" is extremely rare and largely nonexistent in standard English usage. It's a contrived formation, combining "hyper-" (excessive), "intellectual" (relating to intellect), and "-ness" (state or quality), resulting in a plural form suggesting multiple instances of excessive intellectualism.  The word implies an excessive display or preoccupation with intellectual pursuits, often to the point of being ostentatious or impractical.  It suggests a potentially negative connotation, implying artificiality or a lack of genuine connection.  Because of its rarity and artificiality, it's difficult to provide examples of its usage in natural sentences.  The word is best avoided in favor of clearer, more concise alternatives.|No example sentences are readily available due to the word's rarity and artificiality. |近义词：excessive intellectualism, pretentious displays of knowledge, intellectual snobbery|反义词：Simplicity, common sense, practicality|名词
