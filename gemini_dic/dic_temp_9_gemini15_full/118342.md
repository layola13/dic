meridional:/məˈrɪdiənəl/| adj.|正午的；子午线的；南北向的；|Relating to or situated in the direction of the meridian; running north and south.  The term often refers to geographical lines of longitude or to directions. |例句：The meridional winds blew strongly. = 南北向的风强烈地吹着。
The meridional flow of the jet stream influenced the weather pattern. = 急流的南北向流动影响了天气模式。

近义词：north-south, longitudinal (in some contexts)
反义词：latitudinal, east-west,  zonal (in some contexts)

词源:  From Latin *meridionalis, from meridianus "of midday," from meridies "midday," from medius "middle" + dies "day."  The connection to midday arises from the fact that the sun is at its highest point in the sky at midday, which is directly south (in the Northern Hemisphere) along the meridian line.
