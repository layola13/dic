objectionabilities:/əbˈdʒɛkʃənəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可反对性；令人反感之处 | The objectionabilities of the proposal were numerous and significant.  该提案的令人反感之处众多且重大。 | 近义词：undesirability, objections, flaws | 反义词：acceptability, desirability


There is no established word "objectionabilities" in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a non-standard or newly coined word, likely formed by adding the suffix "-abilities" to "objectionable."  Therefore, providing grammatical examples in various tenses is inappropriate as the word itself is not grammatically functional in the same way as established nouns.  The word would function similarly to a noun like "difficulties" or "problems."
