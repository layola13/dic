existible: /ɪɡˈzɪstəbl/ | adj. | 可存在的；可能存在的 |  Existing or able to exist; capable of existence.  The concept is theoretical and may not be existible in practice.  | 近义词：possible, feasible, viable | 反义词：impossible, nonexistent


The word "existible" is relatively rare and less commonly used than synonyms like "possible" or "feasible."  It's formed by adding the prefix "ex-" (meaning "out of" or "from") and the suffix "-ible" (meaning "capable of") to the verb "exist."  This suggests something that can be brought into existence or that has the potential for existence.

例句：

The idea of perpetual motion is theoretically existible, but practically impossible.  = 永动机的概念理论上是可能存在的，但实际上是不可能的。

Some scientists believe that other forms of life, existible in different environments, may exist in the universe. = 一些科学家认为，宇宙中可能存在其他形式的生命，它们可能存在于不同的环境中。


This word doesn't lend itself to typical verb conjugations like "to exist"  because it's an adjective describing a state of possibility, not an action.  Therefore, sections like "USAGE" with tense conjugations are not applicable.  The word functions primarily in declarative or interrogative sentences, as shown in the examples above.  The use of "existible" typically involves discussing theoretical possibilities or hypothetical scenarios.
