nonrepeller: /ˌnɒn.rɪˈpɛlə(r)/ | adj. |非排斥子| A nonrepeller is a point in a dynamical system where nearby points do not move away from it under iteration.  In simpler terms, it's a point that doesn't repel nearby points;  points near a nonrepeller may stay nearby or even move closer. This is in contrast to a repeller, where nearby points move away.  The term is primarily used in mathematics, specifically in the field of dynamical systems and chaos theory. | The fixed point x = 0 of the dynamical system x_{n+1} = x_n^3 is a nonrepeller. | 近义词：attractor (in some contexts, depending on the system) | 反义词：repeller |
