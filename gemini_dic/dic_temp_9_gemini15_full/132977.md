词源:

The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the word "encyclopedic," which derives from "encyclopedia."  "Encyclopedia" itself comes from the Greek words "enkyklios" (circular, general) and "paideia" (education, instruction).  Therefore, "nonencyclopedic" literally means "not relating to or characteristic of an encyclopedia."
