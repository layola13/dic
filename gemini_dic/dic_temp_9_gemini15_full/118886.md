metastoma:/ˌmɛtəˈstoʊmə/ | n. | 后体节，后腹节 | The metastoma is a posterior abdominal segment found in some arthropods, particularly in arachnids and some crustaceans. It's often involved in reproduction or sensory functions.  | Example: The metastoma of this spider species is modified for holding its egg sac.  这个蜘蛛物种的后体节被改造用来容纳它的卵囊。| 近义词: postabdomen (in some contexts) | 反义词: prosoma, cephalothorax


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in zoology and related fields, so the grammatical usages are limited to descriptive sentences and scientific reports.  Here are a few examples demonstrating different tenses within scientific writing:


一般现在时:
The metastoma plays a crucial role in reproduction. = 后体节在繁殖中起着至关重要的作用。
Researchers observe the metastoma's structure in various species. = 研究人员观察不同物种的后体节结构。


一般过去时:
Scientists examined the metastoma of the fossil. = 科学家检查了化石的后体节。
The study described the metastoma's morphology in detail. = 该研究详细描述了后体节的形态。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified a new function for the metastoma. = 研究人员已经确定了后体节的一个新功能。
Studies have shown variations in metastoma size across different populations. = 研究表明不同种群的后体节大小存在差异。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the function of the metastoma was unknown. = 在发现之前，后体节的功能是未知的。
They had already analyzed the metastoma's genetic makeup before publishing the findings. = 他们在发表研究结果之前就已经分析了后体节的基因构成。


将来时:
Future research will investigate the metastoma's evolutionary history. = 未来的研究将调查后体节的进化史。
Scientists will compare the metastoma of different arachnid groups. = 科学家将比较不同蛛形纲动物的后体节。


被动语态:
The metastoma was found to be highly modified. = 发现后体节被高度修饰。
The metastoma's function is still being debated. = 后体节的功能仍在争论中。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "metastoma" as it's a highly specialized scientific term.  Phrases would be constructed within the context of scientific description, for example:


metastoma structure = 后体节结构
metastoma development = 后体节发育
metastoma function = 后体节功能
metastoma morphology = 后体节形态
metastoma evolution = 后体节进化
