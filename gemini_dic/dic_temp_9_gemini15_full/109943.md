词源:

The word "liberalistic" is derived from "liberalism," which originates from the Latin word "liberalis," meaning "free," "generous," or "pertaining to a free person."  The suffix "-istic" is added to create an adjectival form, indicating a characteristic or quality of liberalism.


用法说明:

This word is less frequently used than "liberal" itself.  It is often used to emphasize a more radical or uncompromising aspect of liberal thought or policy.  While "liberal" can encompass a broad range of political and social views, "liberalistic" often suggests a more extreme or doctrinaire adherence to liberal principles.  The word can carry a slightly negative connotation, implying that the liberalism in question is excessive or impractical.  It's important to note that the precise meaning can depend heavily on the context.
