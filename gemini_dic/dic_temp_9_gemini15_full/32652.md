词源:
The word "chitchat" is an onomatopoeia, meaning it imitates the sound of light, informal conversation.  It's a reduplication of "chit," a word of uncertain origin, possibly related to the now-obsolete word "chitter," meaning to chatter.  The combination creates the sense of rapid, lighthearted talk.
