词源:
The word "disillusion" comes from the Old French word "desillusion," which is a combination of the prefix "des-" (meaning "to remove" or "to deprive of") and the word "illusion" (meaning "a false belief or idea").  Therefore, "disillusion" literally means "to remove the illusion" or "to deprive of an illusion".
