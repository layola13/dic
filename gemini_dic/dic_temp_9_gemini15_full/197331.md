Etymology:

The word "Shavuot" (שָׁבוּעֹת) is a Hebrew word meaning "weeks."  It's a plural noun, referring to the seven weeks between Passover and Shavuot. The name reflects the festival's connection to the counting of the Omer, a period of seven weeks leading up to the giving of the Torah on Mount Sinai.  The root שב"ע (shava) means "seven" or "oath" and is linked to the seven weeks of counting. The festival's connection to the harvest is also reflected in its alternative name, "Feast of Weeks."
