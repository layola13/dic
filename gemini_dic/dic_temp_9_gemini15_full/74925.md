词源:  From Middle English *fretten, from Old English *frettēan, frequentative of frettan "to eat away, corrode, gnaw," from Proto-Germanic *frettan.  The sense of "to worry" developed from the image of something being "eaten away" by anxiety. The use describing decoration with frets is a later development, linked to the original meaning of "to make grooves or ridges".
