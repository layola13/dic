词源:
The word "countersink" is a compound word.  "Counter" means "against" or "opposite," and "sink" means "to lower or depress." Therefore, "countersink" literally means "to sink against" or "to depress into a surface."  The word evolved from the practice of sinking something (like a screw head) into a surface, creating a recess in a counter-direction to the original surface.
