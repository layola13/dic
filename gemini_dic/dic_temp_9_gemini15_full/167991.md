prism: /ˈprɪzəm/ | n. |棱镜，棱柱体 | A transparent object, usually with triangular bases, that separates white light into a spectrum of colors.  It also refers to something that distorts or refracts something else. | 例句：A prism separates white light into a rainbow of colors. 棱镜将白光分解成彩虹般的颜色。

The prism in the science lab demonstrated the refraction of light.  科学实验室里的棱镜演示了光的折射。


近义词：refractor, lens (in some contexts) | 反义词：None specifically, but the opposite concept might be something that doesn't refract light.


词源:  From Middle French *prisme, from Latin prisma, from Greek prisma ("something sawed off," "anything cut off"), from prínō ("I saw").  The Greek word originally referred to a sawed-off piece of wood, and later to a geometric solid.
