The word "gord" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A proper noun:**  It might be a name or place name not widely known.
* **A dialect word or slang:**  It could be used in a specific region or community.
* **A newly coined word:** It's possible it's a very recent addition to the language.

If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, the surrounding sentence), it might be possible to determine its meaning and offer an analysis.
