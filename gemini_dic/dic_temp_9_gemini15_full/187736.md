词源:
The word "rootednesses" is derived from the word "root," which has Old English origins (from the Proto-Germanic *wrōt).  The suffix "-ed" indicates a past participle, suggesting a state of being rooted. The further suffix "-ness" transforms it into a noun, indicating a quality or state.  The final "-es" adds a pluralizing effect, signifying multiple instances of rootedness.
