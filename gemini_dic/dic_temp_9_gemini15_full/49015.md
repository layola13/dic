词源:
The word "degrading" comes from the verb "degrade," which originates from the Old French word "degrader," meaning "to lower in rank or status."  This, in turn, comes from the Latin prefix "de-" (down, away from) and "gradus" (step, degree).  Therefore, the core meaning implies a lowering or diminishing of something, whether it be a person's status, moral character, or the quality of something.
