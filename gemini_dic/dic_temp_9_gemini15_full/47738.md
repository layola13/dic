decahedron:/ˌdekəˈhiːdrən/| n. |十面体|A decahedron is a three-dimensional geometric shape with ten flat faces.  It can be regular (all faces are congruent regular polygons) or irregular (faces are not all congruent).|Example: The crystal exhibited a complex decahedral structure.  这个晶体展现出一个复杂的十面体结构。|近义词：ten-sided solid|反义词：无
