词源:

The word "sacrilegiously" is derived from the noun "sacrilege," which comes from Late Latin *sacrilegium.  This in turn is formed from the Latin words "sacr-" (sacred) and "leg-" (to gather, to collect).  The suffix "-ious" transforms the noun into an adjective, and "-ly" further modifies it into an adverb.  Therefore, the word literally means "in a manner of stealing or desecrating sacred things."
