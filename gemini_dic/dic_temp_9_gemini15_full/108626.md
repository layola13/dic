leadhillite:/ˌliːdˈhaɪlaɪt/| n. |铅白铅矿|A rare lead carbonate sulfate hydroxide mineral.  It is a secondary mineral, meaning it forms from the alteration of other minerals.  Leadhillite is usually found in oxidized lead deposits, often associated with other lead minerals such as cerussite and anglesite.  It is known for its attractive, often pearly or resinous luster and its characteristic tabular or prismatic crystal habit. Its chemical formula is Pb₄(SO₄)(CO₃)₂(OH)₂.|Leadhillite crystals were found in the Broken Hill mine in Australia.|近义词：暂无精确近义词，可根据具体语境选择其他铅矿物名称|反义词：暂无
