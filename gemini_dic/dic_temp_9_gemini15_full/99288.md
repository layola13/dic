词源:
The word "intercoordinated" is a combination of "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and "coordinated" (meaning "brought into a common action, movement, or condition").  The root "co-" means "together," "ordin-" derives from the Latin "ordo" meaning "order," and "-ate" is a verb suffix.  Thus, the word literally means "brought into a common order between or among."
