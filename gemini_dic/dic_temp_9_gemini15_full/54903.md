词源:
The word "disports" comes from the Old French word "desporter," which means "to divert," "to amuse," or "to carry away."  This in turn derives from the Latin "disportare," a compound of "dis-" (apart, away) and "portare" (to carry).  The sense of carrying oneself away implies a joyful, carefree movement, leading to the modern meaning of playful activity.
