lensing: /ˈlɛnzɪŋ/ | n. |透镜效应，引力透镜|The bending of light as it passes through a gravitational field, causing a distortion of the image of a distant object.  This effect is predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity. |Example: Gravitational lensing can magnify distant galaxies, making them appear brighter and larger than they actually are. 引力透镜效应可以放大遥远的星系，使它们看起来比实际更明亮更大。|近义词: gravitational lensing, light bending |反义词: N/A

USAGE->
一般现在时:
Gravitational lensing distorts the light from distant objects. = 引力透镜扭曲了来自遥远物体的光。
The telescope uses lensing to magnify faint objects. = 望远镜利用透镜效应来放大暗弱的天体。

一般过去时:
Scientists observed lensing effects during the experiment. = 科学家在实验中观察到了透镜效应。
The image was significantly distorted by lensing. = 图像被透镜效应严重扭曲了。


现在完成时:
Astronomers have used lensing to discover many distant galaxies. = 天文学家已经利用透镜效应发现了许多遥远的星系。
Researchers have confirmed the existence of lensing in several observations. = 研究人员在几次观测中证实了透镜效应的存在。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, scientists hadn't fully understood lensing. = 在发现之前，科学家们并没有完全理解透镜效应。
They had already predicted the lensing effect based on theoretical calculations. = 他们已经根据理论计算预测了透镜效应。


将来时:
Future telescopes will use lensing to explore the early universe. = 未来的望远镜将利用透镜效应来探索早期宇宙。
Scientists will continue to study lensing to understand its implications. = 科学家们将继续研究透镜效应以了解其意义。


虚拟语气:
If we had better instruments, we could observe more subtle lensing effects. = 如果我们有更好的仪器，我们就能观察到更细微的透镜效应。
I wish we understood the complex details of lensing better. = 我希望我们能更好地理解透镜效应的复杂细节。


被动语态:
The light was lensed by the massive galaxy. = 光线被巨大的星系所偏折（发生了透镜效应）。
Many distant galaxies have been discovered through lensing. = 许多遥远的星系是通过透镜效应被发现的。


疑问句:
Does lensing affect the observed redshift of galaxies? = 透镜效应是否会影响观测到的星系红移？
How strong is the lensing effect in this particular cluster? = 在这个特殊的星系团中，透镜效应有多强？


否定句:
Lensing does not always produce perfectly circular arcs. = 透镜效应并不总是产生完美的圆弧。
The observed distortion was not solely due to lensing. = 观测到的扭曲并非完全是由透镜效应引起的。


PHRASE->
