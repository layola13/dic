词源:
The word "commits" comes from the Old French word "commettre," which itself comes from the Latin "committere."  "Committere" is composed of "com-" (together, with) and "mittere" (to send, to let go).  Therefore, the original meaning implied a "sending together" or "entrusting." Over time, the meaning broadened to include the act of doing something, often something wrong.  The usage in computer science (committing code changes) is a relatively recent development, building on the sense of "entrusting" or "sending" data to a repository.
