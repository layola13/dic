distributiveness:/ˌdɪstrɪˈbjuːtɪvnəs/ | n. | 分配性；分布性 | The quality or state of being distributive; the property of an operation that allows it to be performed on each element of a set individually and then combined to yield the same result as performing the operation on the entire set.  For example, multiplication is distributive over addition (a(b+c) = ab + ac).  | 例句：The distributiveness of the multiplication operation simplifies many calculations.  分配运算的分配性简化了许多计算。

The study of the distributiveness of various operators is a key concept in abstract algebra.  对各种运算符的分配性的研究是抽象代数中的一个关键概念。

词源:  The word "distributiveness" is derived from the verb "distribute," which comes from the Late Latin word *distribuere*, meaning "to divide," "to spread," or "to allot."  The suffix "-ive" indicates a quality or tendency.  Therefore, "distributiveness" signifies the quality or property of being able to distribute or be distributed.


用法说明:

"Distributiveness" is primarily used in mathematical contexts, particularly in algebra and related fields. It refers to a property of certain operations (like multiplication) where the operation can be applied to individual elements of a set before combining the results, yielding the same outcome as applying the operation to the entire set.  This property is crucial for simplifying calculations and proving mathematical theorems.  The term is less common in everyday language.
