词源:

The word "hickish" derives from "hick," which is a derogatory term for a rural person, often implying naiveté and lack of sophistication. The suffix "-ish" adds a slightly less intense or more nuanced quality to the word, making it less overtly offensive but still carrying the core meaning.  The exact origins of "hick" are uncertain, but various etymological suggestions exist, with some linking it to onomatopoeic imitations of rural sounds or to older dialect words.
