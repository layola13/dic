The word "reconfering" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).

If it was intended to be a word, it might be a combination of "re-" (again) and "conferring" (meeting to discuss something).  In that case, we can analyze "conferring" and then extrapolate a possible meaning for "reconfering."


conferring: /kənˈfɜːrɪŋ/ | v. | 商讨，授予 |  The act of consulting, discussing, or exchanging ideas with others; also the act of granting or bestowing something. | Example:  They are conferring on the best course of action.  他们在商讨最佳行动方案。  The university conferred an honorary degree upon him.  大学授予他荣誉学位。 | 近义词: discussing, consulting, deliberating | 反义词: withholding, refusing


If "reconfering" were to exist, its meaning would likely be:  to confer again; to have another meeting to discuss something; to reconsider a decision through further discussion.

Because "reconfering" isn't a real word, we can't provide usage examples in different tenses or grammatical structures, nor can we offer common phrases using it.  The closest we can get is to show examples using "re-conferring" (using a hyphen to show it's a compound term):

**Possible Usage of "re-conferring" (hypothetical):**

* **Present Participle:** They are re-conferring about the budget.  (他们在重新商讨预算。)
* **Past Participle:** Having re-conferred, they reached a new agreement.  (重新商讨后，他们达成了一项新的协议。)


**Note:** To use this word effectively, it would need to be explicitly defined within a specific context to avoid confusion.  Using established words like "re-discussing," "re-examining," or "holding another meeting" would be clearer and more appropriate in most situations.
