词源:
The word "monopolizations" is derived from "monopoly," which comes from the Greek words "monos" (μόνος), meaning "single" or "alone," and "polein" (πωλεῖν), meaning "to sell."  Therefore, "monopoly" literally means "selling alone," referring to the exclusive control of the sale of a commodity or service.  The suffix "-ization" indicates the process of making something into a monopoly.
