The word "indemnifiers" is derived from the verb "indemnify," which comes from the Old French word "indemnifier," meaning "to secure against loss or harm," ultimately from the Latin prefix "in-" (not) + "damnum" (loss, damage) + "-fy" (to make).  The "-ers" suffix denotes the person or thing that performs the action.
