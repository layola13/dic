Etymology:

The word "filler" comes from the verb "fill," meaning to make something full or complete.  The suffix "-er"  indicates an agent or thing that performs the action.  Its evolution reflects its primary function—to fill a space or void.  The modern usage extending to meaningless speech developed later.  The root "fill" itself traces back to Proto-Germanic *fulljan, and ultimately to Proto-Indo-European *pel- ("to fill").
