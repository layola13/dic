词源:
The term "pell-mell" originates from the Old French phrase "pele mele," which literally translates to "ball mixed."  "Pele" referred to a ball or a group of things, and "mele" signified mixing or confusion.  The meaning evolved to describe a state of disorder and hurried movement.  Over time, the pronunciation shifted to the current "pell-mell" while retaining its original sense of chaotic activity.
