electrode:/ɪˈlɛktrəʊd/|/ˈɛləktroʊd/| n. |电极|A conductor through which electricity enters or leaves an object, substance, or system.  An electrode is typically a metal or graphite rod or plate used to make electrical contact with a nonmetallic part of a circuit, such as an electrolyte solution. |例句：The scientist carefully inserted the electrode into the solution.  科学家小心地将电极插入溶液中。

例句：The battery's positive electrode is connected to the motor. 电池的正极连接到电机上。


近义词：terminal, contact, pole

反义词：insulator

词源:
The word "electrode" comes from the combination of "electro-" (from "electricity") and "-ode" (from the Greek word "hodos," meaning "way" or "path").  Therefore, the word literally means "the way of electricity."
