congealablenesses: /kənˌdʒiːləˈbeɪbəlnəsəz/ | n. |凝固能力；凝结性；可凝固性 |The word "congealablenesses" refers to the various capacities or degrees to which substances can congeal or solidify.  It is a rare and somewhat awkward word, formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to the adjective "congealable," which itself is derived from the verb "congeal." The plural form implies multiple instances or types of congealing abilities.  There is no single perfect synonym.   |  The study explored the congealablenesses of different types of blood plasma under varying temperature conditions.  这项研究探讨了不同类型的血浆在不同温度条件下的凝固能力。 | (No readily available perfect synonyms due to the word's rarity.  Related concepts include: coagulability, solidifiability, gelation properties) |  (No direct antonyms. The opposite concept would be something like "liquidity," "fluidity," or "non-solidifiability") | n.
