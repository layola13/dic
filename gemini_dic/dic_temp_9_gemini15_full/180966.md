词源:
The word "reimbursements" is derived from the verb "reimburse," which itself comes from the Old French word "reimbourser," meaning "to put back into one's purse."  The prefix "re-" indicates "again" or "back," while "imburse" is related to the Old French "bourse," meaning "purse."  Therefore, the word literally means "to put back into the purse," signifying repayment.
