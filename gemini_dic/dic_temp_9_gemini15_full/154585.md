persecutivenesses:/ˌpɜːrsɪˈkjuːtɪvnəsɪz/| n. |迫害的反复行为；一再迫害的倾向|The word "persecutivenesses" is extremely rare and arguably not a legitimate word in standard English.  It's a plural form derived from "persecutiveness," which itself is not frequently used.  It implies repeated acts of persecution or a persistent tendency towards persecuting others. The word is formed by adding the plural suffix "-es" to the already uncommon noun "persecutiveness". Because of its rarity, there are no readily available examples in standard corpora, and its usage should be avoided in favor of clearer, more common alternatives.|近义词：repeated persecutions, instances of persecution, persecution tendencies |反义词：tolerance, acceptance, compassion
