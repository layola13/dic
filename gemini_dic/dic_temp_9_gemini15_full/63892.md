epinastic:/ˌɛpɪˈnæstɪk/| adj.| 向上弯曲的；背地性向上的 | Relating to or characterized by epinasty, the upward curvature of a plant organ, such as a leaf or stem, caused by more rapid growth on the upper side. This is often a response to environmental stimuli like high humidity or ethylene gas. | Example: The leaves exhibited a pronounced epinastic curvature in response to the high humidity.  叶片因高湿度而表现出明显的背地性弯曲。|近义词：hyponastic (反义词)|反义词：hyponastic


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The leaves show epinastic movement. = 叶片显示背地性运动。
Ethylene causes epinastic responses in plants. = 乙烯引起植物的背地性反应。

一般过去时:
