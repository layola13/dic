humite:/ˈhjuːmaɪt/ | n. | 羟镁石 | A magnesium silicate hydroxide mineral, often found in metamorphic rocks. It is a relatively rare mineral, typically occurring in small crystals.  | Example:  The sample contained small, well-formed crystals of humite.  该样品含有少量形态良好的羟镁石晶体。 | 近义词: chondrodite, clinohumite, norbergite (these are all members of the humite group) | 反义词:  (No direct antonyms, as it's a specific mineral) |  名词


USAGE->
This word, being a noun referring to a specific mineral, doesn't have verb conjugations or typical grammatical variations like "what" does.  The usage focuses on its descriptive and identifying properties within geological contexts.


Example 1:  Geologists identified humite within the newly discovered rock formation. 地质学家在新发现的岩层中发现了羟镁石。

Example 2: The analysis revealed a high concentration of humite in the sample. 分析显示样品中羟镁石浓度很高。
