词源:
leisureness derives from the adjective "leisurely" which in turn comes from the Old French word "leisire," meaning "free time, permission,"  ultimately tracing back to the Latin word "licere," meaning "to be permitted, to be allowed."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, signifying a state or quality.
