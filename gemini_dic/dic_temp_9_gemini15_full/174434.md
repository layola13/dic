词源:  The word "quilted" derives from the noun "quilt," which has origins in the Middle English word "quilte," ultimately from the Old French word "culte" or "coulte," meaning a mattress or bed.  The suffix "-ed" indicates the past participle, signifying something that has been quilted.  The development reflects the evolution of the technique from simple padding to the more decorative, layered form we associate with quilts today.
