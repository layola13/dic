词源:

The word "skua" comes from the Old Norse word *skúfr, referring to a type of gull or seabird.  The term eventually made its way into English, retaining its original meaning.  The Norse word may be related to Old English *scūf, meaning "scoff" or "scold," reflecting the bird's aggressive behavior.
