calques: /ˈkælkz/ | n. | 借词；卡尔克；语义借词 | A calque is a word or phrase borrowed from another language by literal, word-for-word translation.  It differs from a loanword, which is borrowed directly without translation.  Calques often retain the grammatical structure of the original language, leading to expressions that might sound unnatural or awkward in the borrowing language. | Example:  The English phrase "skyscraper" is a calque of the German "Wolkenkratzer" (cloud scraper).  Another example is "butterfly" which is a calque from the Dutch "boter vliege" (butter fly).| 近义词：loan translation, semantic borrowing | 反义词：loanword
