This word is a compound of "pseudo" and "Semitic".

* **pseudo-**:  (prefix)  /ˈsuːdəʊ/ meaning "false," "sham," "pretended," or "spurious."  It comes from the Greek word ψευδής (pseudēs) meaning "false" or "lying."

* **Semitic**: /sɪˈmɪtɪk/  (adj.) relating to the Semitic languages, a group of related languages that includes Arabic, Hebrew, and Akkadian. These languages share a common ancestor and exhibit similar grammatical structures and vocabulary.  The term ultimately derives from Shem, one of the sons of Noah in the Bible, from whom the Semitic peoples are traditionally believed to have descended.
