electromagnets:/ɪˌlɛktrəʊˈmæɡnɛts/ | n. | 电磁铁 | An electromagnet is a type of magnet in which the magnetic field is produced by an electric current.  Unlike permanent magnets, electromagnets can be turned on and off by controlling the flow of electricity. They are widely used in various applications due to their ability to create strong magnetic fields that can be easily controlled. | Example: The crane used powerful electromagnets to lift the scrap metal.  起重机用强大的电磁铁来吊起废金属。  The experiment demonstrated the principles of electromagnetism using a simple electromagnet.  实验利用简单的电磁铁演示了电磁学的原理。 | 近义词: magnetic coil, solenoid | 反义词: permanent magnet
