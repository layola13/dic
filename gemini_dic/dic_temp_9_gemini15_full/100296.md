词源:
The term "intersex" is a relatively recent coinage, replacing older, often stigmatizing terms.  It combines the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between") with "sex," reflecting the condition's position between typical male and female sex characteristics.  The term's evolution reflects changing understandings and increased advocacy for the rights and recognition of intersex individuals.
