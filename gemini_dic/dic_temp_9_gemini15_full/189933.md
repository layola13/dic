The word "sance" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word, such as "chance," "sense," or "dance."  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **A neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word, a term used within a specific community or subculture, or a slang word with limited usage.  More context is needed to understand its meaning.

3. **A proper noun:** It could be a name or a place name, though again, more context is needed.

Without further information, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  If you can provide the context in which you encountered this word, I can attempt to offer a more accurate interpretation.
