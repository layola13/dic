The word "christom" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it in major resources like Merriam-Webster, Oxford English Dictionary, or Cambridge Dictionary.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested.  It may be a misspelling, a regional dialect word, a neologism, or a proper noun not widely known.  More context is needed to understand its possible meaning.
