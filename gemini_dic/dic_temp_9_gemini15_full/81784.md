词源:
The word "gremlin" emerged in World War II,  gaining popularity through the use in RAF slang. While its precise etymology is debated, it's believed to be connected to earlier words suggesting small, mischievous spirits or goblins.  Some suggest a connection to the Scottish word "grim," meaning "ugly" or "fierce," or to other similar terms for mischievous spirits in folklore.  The word's association with machinery problems solidified during the war years, as pilots and mechanics often attributed unexplained malfunctions to these unseen troublemakers.
