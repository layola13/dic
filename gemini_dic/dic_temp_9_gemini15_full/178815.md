recursiveness:/rɪˈkɜːrsɪvnəs/ | n. | 递归性；自反性 | The quality or state of being recursive;  the ability of a process or system to repeat itself or call itself. Recursiveness is a fundamental concept in computer science, mathematics, and linguistics.  It involves a process or function that calls itself within its own definition. | Example: The recursive nature of the fractal pattern created intricate details.  递归的特性使分形图案产生了复杂精细的细节。 The recursive definition of the Fibonacci sequence allows for easy calculation of its terms. 斐波那契数列的递归定义使得其项的计算变得容易。 | 近义词：self-reference, iteration, repetition | 反义词：linearity, directness
