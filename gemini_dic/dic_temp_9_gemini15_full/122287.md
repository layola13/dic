mitosis:/maɪˈtoʊsɪs/ | n. | 有丝分裂 | The process of cell division in which the nucleus divides into two nuclei, each containing a complete set of chromosomes, followed by the division of the cytoplasm to produce two daughter cells.  | Example: Mitosis is essential for growth and repair of tissues in multicellular organisms.  有丝分裂对于多细胞生物的组织生长和修复至关重要。  | 近义词：cell division, karyokinesis | 反义词：meiosis


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Mitosis occurs in somatic cells. = 有丝分裂发生在体细胞中。
The cell undergoes mitosis. = 细胞进行有丝分裂。

一般过去时:

Scientists have studied mitosis extensively. = 科学家们已经广泛研究了有丝分裂。

过去完成时:
Mitosis had already begun before the treatment. = 在治疗之前，有丝分裂就已经开始了。

虚拟语气:
If the cell were to undergo mitosis, it would divide. = 如果细胞进行有丝分裂，它就会分裂。
It is essential that mitosis proceeds correctly. = 有丝分裂正确进行至关重要。

被动语态:
