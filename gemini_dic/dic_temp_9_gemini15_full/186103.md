rhabdocoela:/ˌræbdoʊˈsiːlə/| n. | 单肠目 | Rhabdocoela is an order of very small, free-living flatworms (Turbellaria) characterized by a simple, unbranched gut.  They are primarily aquatic, inhabiting freshwater, marine, and sometimes terrestrial environments. They are often found in moist soil and leaf litter. Many are predators or scavengers, feeding on small invertebrates or organic matter.  | Example:  The study focused on the diversity of rhabdocoel flatworms in the local stream.  这项研究侧重于当地溪流中单肠目涡虫的多样性。|近义词:Turbellaria (a broader group)|反义词: N/A
