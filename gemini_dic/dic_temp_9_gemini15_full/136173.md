词源:
The word "nonreimbursement" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "reimbursement" (meaning "the act of reimbursing").  "Reimbursement" itself comes from the verb "reimburse," which is from the Old French "reimbourser," ultimately from the Germanic roots meaning "to put back into the purse."
