词源:  The word "electromedical" is a combination of "electro-" (relating to electricity) and "medical" (relating to medicine or healing).  The "electro-" prefix derives from the Greek word "elektron," meaning amber (a substance that, when rubbed, attracts light objects due to static electricity).  The word "medical" comes from the Latin word "medicus," meaning physician or healer.
