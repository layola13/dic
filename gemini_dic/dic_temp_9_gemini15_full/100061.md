interpolant:/ɪnˈtɜːrpələnt/| n. |插值函数，内插值|A function that is used to estimate values between known data points.  It's a mathematical function that creates a curve or surface that passes through a set of given data points.  This is often used in computer graphics, signal processing, and other fields where smooth transitions between discrete data points are needed.| Example:  The interpolant smoothly connected the scattered data points, creating a continuous curve.  插值函数平滑地连接了分散的数据点，创建了一条连续曲线。|近义词：interpolator, approximant |反义词：extrapolant


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't conjugate like verbs.  Therefore, typical verb tenses are not applicable.  The usage focuses on its function within mathematical and computational contexts.

Example 1: We used a linear interpolant to estimate the missing values in the dataset. 我们使用线性插值函数来估计数据集中缺失的值。

Example 2: The choice of interpolant significantly affected the accuracy of the simulation. 插值函数的选择显著影响了仿真的精度。
