词源:
The word "cipher" comes from the Arabic word "ṣifr," meaning "zero" or "nothing."  This is because the Arabic numeral system introduced the concept of zero, which was crucial for developing more advanced mathematical notation and encryption methods.  Over time, the meaning evolved to include secret codes and later, an insignificant person.
