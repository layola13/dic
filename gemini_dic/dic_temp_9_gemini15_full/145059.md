词源:

* **over-**:  prefix indicating excess or exaggeration. (表示过度或夸张的前缀)
* **ambitious**:  adjective meaning having or showing a strong desire and determination to succeed. (形容词，意为有或显示出强烈成功欲望和决心)  Originates from Latin *ambitio*, meaning "a going around," "a canvassing for votes," and later "ambition." (源自拉丁语 *ambitio*，意思是“四处走动”、“四处拉选票”，后来是“野心”)

因此，overambitiously  结合了 "over-" 的过度含义和 "ambitious" 的雄心勃勃之意，表达“过分雄心勃勃地” 的意思。
