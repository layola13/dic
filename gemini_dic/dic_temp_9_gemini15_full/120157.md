词源:

The word "mind-bending" is a compound word.  It combines "mind," referring to the intellect or mental processes, with "bending," implying a twisting, warping, or distortion of those processes.  The "bending" suggests a challenging or overwhelming effect on one's mental capabilities.  The term emerged in the latter half of the 20th century, likely gaining popularity with the rise of psychedelic culture and complex philosophical or scientific ideas that challenged conventional thought.  While a precise etymology is difficult to pinpoint, its usage strongly reflects the cognitive dissonance and unexpected twists often found in complex narratives, puzzles, or abstract concepts.
