reassists:/ˌriːəˈsɪsts/ | v. |重新帮助，再次援助 | To assist again or repeatedly.  The word is not a standard English word; it's a made-up word formed by combining "re-" (again) and "assists" (present tense of the verb "assist").  It lacks established usage and should be avoided in formal writing.  Instead, use clearer alternatives. | Example: The rescue team *reassists* the injured hiker after a sudden rockslide. (This sentence is grammatically correct but uses an unconventional word.) | 近义词: re-aid, help again, support again | 反义词: hinder, obstruct, impede | 动词
