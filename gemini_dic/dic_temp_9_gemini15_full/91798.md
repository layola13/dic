词源:  The word is a combination of "hyper-" (meaning "excessive" or "beyond") and "federalist" (relating to federalism, a system of government where power is divided between a central government and subnational units).  Thus, "hyperfederalist" describes a system that takes federalism to an extreme, granting excessive power to the subnational units.
