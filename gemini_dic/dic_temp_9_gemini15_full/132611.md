PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "nondirigibilities".  The word itself is so uncommon that it's unlikely to appear in idiomatic expressions.  Phrases would need to be constructed around the concept of lack of control.  For example:

dealing with nondirigibilities = 处理不可控性
mitigating nondirigibilities = 减轻不可控性
assessing nondirigibilities = 评估不可控性
subject to nondirigibilities = 受不可控性影响
inherent nondirigibilities = 固有的不可控性


词源:
The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and "dirigibility," which comes from the French "dirigeable," meaning "steerable" or "controllable."  Thus, "nondirigibilities" refers to the qualities or states of being unsteerable or uncontrollable.
