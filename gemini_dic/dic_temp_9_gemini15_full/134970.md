The word "nonnattiest" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need either a corrected spelling or context where you encountered this word.
