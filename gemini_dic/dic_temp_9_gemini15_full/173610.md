quasi-inherited:/ˈkwɑːzaɪɪnˈhɛrɪtɪd/| adj.|准遗传的，似遗传的|Appearing to be inherited, but not through the usual genetic mechanisms.  It often describes traits or characteristics that resemble inherited traits in their pattern of transmission but are not caused by genes passed from parents to offspring.  The mechanism might involve epigenetic modifications, environmental factors, or other non-genetic influences.|例句：The researchers found evidence of a quasi-inherited predisposition to the disease, suggesting environmental factors play a significant role.|近义词：epigenetically influenced, environmentally determined|反义词：genetically inherited, innate


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The trait shows a quasi-inherited pattern of transmission. =  这种性状表现出准遗传的传递模式。
This disease exhibits quasi-inherited characteristics. = 这种疾病表现出准遗传的特征。


一般过去时:
Scientists studied the quasi-inherited nature of the behavioral trait. = 科学家研究了这种行为性状的准遗传特性。
Researchers investigated whether the observed pattern was truly quasi-inherited. = 研究人员调查了观察到的模式是否确实是准遗传的。


现在完成时:
Studies have revealed many instances of quasi-inherited traits. = 研究已经揭示了许多准遗传性状的例子。
Researchers have confirmed that certain phenotypes are quasi-inherited. = 研究人员已经证实某些表型是准遗传的。


过去完成时:
Before the study, it was unclear whether the condition was quasi-inherited. = 在研究之前，尚不清楚这种情况是否是准遗传的。
They had hypothesized that the observed similarity was due to quasi-inherited factors. = 他们假设观察到的相似性是由于准遗传因素造成的。


将来时:
Future research will explore the mechanisms underlying quasi-inherited diseases. = 未来的研究将探索准遗传疾病的潜在机制。
Scientists will investigate how environmental factors contribute to quasi-inherited traits. = 科学家将研究环境因素如何导致准遗传性状。


虚拟语气:
If the trait were truly inherited, we would expect a different pattern. = 如果该性状是真正遗传的，我们会期望看到不同的模式。
It would be significant if we could prove that the behavior is quasi-inherited. = 如果我们能够证明这种行为是准遗传的，那将意义重大。


被动语态:
The quasi-inherited nature of the condition was investigated thoroughly. = 这种情况的准遗传特性得到了彻底的调查。
Several factors contributing to the quasi-inherited trait have been identified. = 导致准遗传性状的几个因素已经被识别出来。


疑问句:
Is this characteristic truly inherited, or is it quasi-inherited? = 这种特性是真正遗传的，还是准遗传的？
What are the underlying mechanisms of this quasi-inherited condition? = 这种准遗传疾病的潜在机制是什么？


否定句:
The condition is not genetically inherited; it's quasi-inherited. = 这种情况不是遗传的；它是准遗传的。
The observed pattern does not support a purely genetically inherited model, suggesting a quasi-inherited component. = 观察到的模式不支持纯粹的遗传模型，这表明存在准遗传成分。


PHRASE->
quasi-inherited traits = 准遗传性状
quasi-inherited diseases = 准遗传疾病
mechanisms of quasi-inheritance = 准遗传机制
quasi-inherited predisposition = 准遗传易感性
studies on quasi-inheritance = 关于准遗传的研究
