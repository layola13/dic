countertransport:/ˈkaʊntə(r)trænspɔːrt/| n. |逆向转运，反向转运|The movement of a substance across a membrane against its concentration gradient, coupled with the movement of another substance in the opposite direction.  This process does not require energy directly, as the energy is provided by the simultaneous movement of the other substance.|Example: Sodium-calcium countertransport is a crucial mechanism in maintaining intracellular calcium homeostasis. 钠钙逆向转运是维持细胞内钙稳态的关键机制。|近义词：antiport, exchange diffusion |反义词：uniport
