hellenotype:/ˈhɛlənoʊtaɪp/| n. |希腊基因型，希腊人基因组|A hellenotype refers to the genetic makeup characteristic of people of Greek ancestry.  It's a term used in population genetics and related fields to describe the specific combination of genes and alleles prevalent in individuals tracing their origins to Greece.  The term is analogous to other "-otype" terms like phenotype and genotype, focusing on the genetic component specific to a particular population group. The precise genetic markers defining a "hellenotype" are still being researched and refined as genetic studies progress.|Example:  Studies are underway to identify the specific hellenotype associated with certain genetic predispositions.  = 研究正在进行中，以识别与某些遗传倾向相关的特定希腊基因型。|近义词：Greek genome, Greek genetic profile|反义词：None directly applicable, but one could contrast it with other population-specific genetic profiles (e.g., a Scandinavian genotype).|名词


USAGE->
(Because "hellenotype" is a noun,  verb tenses don't apply directly.  The usage examples illustrate how the word is used in sentences.)

Example 1:  The researchers compared the hellenotype of the ancient skeletal remains with modern Greek populations. = 研究人员将古代骨骼遗骸的希腊基因型与现代希腊人群进行了比较。

Example 2:  Further analysis of the hellenotype revealed unexpected genetic diversity within the studied group. = 对希腊基因型的进一步分析揭示了所研究群体中意想不到的遗传多样性。


PHRASE->
(Phrases using "hellenotype" are limited given its specialized nature.  General genetic phrases could be used in conjunction with it.)

Example 1:  "Analysis of the hellenotype and its relation to..." = 希腊基因型及其与……的关系分析

Example 2:  "The prevalence of this specific hellenotype..." = 这种特定希腊基因型的流行程度……

Example 3: "Differences in hellenotype between..." = ……之间希腊基因型的差异

Example 4: "Studying the hellenotype to understand..." = 研究希腊基因型以了解……

Example 5: "The complete hellenotype sequencing..." = 完全的希腊基因型测序……
