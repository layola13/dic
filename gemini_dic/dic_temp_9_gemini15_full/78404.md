词源:

The phrasal verb "get hold of" combines the verb "get" (meaning "obtain" or "acquire") with the noun phrase "hold of" (meaning "possession" or "control").  The origin of "get" is Old English "getan," and "hold" comes from Old English "haldan," meaning "to hold." The meaning of the phrase developed naturally from the literal meaning of obtaining physical possession to include the more abstract sense of obtaining information or contacting someone.
