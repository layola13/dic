The word "emitsus" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information according to the requested format.  It might be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specialized field, or a word from another language.  More context is needed to understand its meaning and potential usage.
