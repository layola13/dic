词源:
The word "offloading" comes from the verb "offload," which is a combination of the preposition "off" and the verb "load."  The prefix "off" indicates removal or separation, while "load" refers to the burden or cargo being removed.  Therefore, "offloading" literally means the act of removing a load.
