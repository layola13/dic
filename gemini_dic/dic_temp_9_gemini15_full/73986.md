fortrans:/ˈfɔːrtrænz/| n. |福特兰(一种编程语言)|FORTRAN (Formula Translation) is a general-purpose, imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing.  It was originally developed in the 1950s by IBM, and has undergone many revisions over the years.  It is known for its readability and efficiency in handling mathematical calculations.|Example:  Early supercomputers often relied on FORTRAN for their complex calculations. 早期的超级计算机通常依赖于FORTRAN进行复杂的计算。|近义词：ALGOL, COBOL (depending on application)|反义词：None|名词
