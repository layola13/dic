polyacoustics: /ˌpɒliəˈkuːstɪks/ | /ˌpɑːliəˈkuːstɪks/ | n. | 多声学；多声现象 | The study of multiple sounds and their interactions, including the perception and processing of complex auditory environments.  This field often overlaps with psychoacoustics and environmental acoustics. It examines how the brain processes multiple sound sources simultaneously,  the effects of masking and other auditory phenomena in complex sound scenes, and applications in areas like speech intelligibility and soundscape design. | Example: Research in polyacoustics is crucial for understanding how humans perceive and interact with complex auditory environments, such as crowded streets or concert halls. | 近义词: multi-channel audio, spatial audio | 反义词: monaural, single-channel audio
