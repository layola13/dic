pseudo-statement:/ˈsuːdoʊˌsteɪtmənt/| n.|伪语句，似是而非的陈述|A pseudo-statement is a statement that appears to be meaningful but lacks real substance or logical coherence.  It may use grammatical structures and vocabulary correctly but conveys no factual information or coherent meaning.  They are often used in philosophy, logic, and linguistics to illustrate concepts related to meaning, truth, and validity. |Example: "The color green sleeps furiously." This sentence is grammatically correct but semantically nonsensical; it is a pseudo-statement.|近义词：nonsensical statement, meaningless assertion, empty statement|反义词：factual statement, true statement, valid statement


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in discussions of logic, philosophy, and linguistics, not in everyday conversation.  Therefore, examples illustrating grammatical tenses are less relevant.  Instead, examples will demonstrate the different contexts in which a pseudo-statement might appear.


In philosophy:
The statement "Time is a river" is often considered a pseudo-statement because it uses metaphorical language that obscures rather than clarifies the nature of time. =  语句“时间是一条河流”通常被认为是一个伪语句，因为它使用了隐晦而非阐明时间本质的隐喻语言。

In linguistics:
The sentence "Colorless green ideas sleep furiously" is a famous example of a grammatically correct but semantically meaningless pseudo-statement used by Noam Chomsky to illustrate his theories of syntax. =  句子“无色的绿色思想狂怒地睡眠”是乔姆斯基用来阐明其句法理论的一个著名的语法正确但语义上毫无意义的伪语句的例子。


In a logical argument:
The argument "All unicorns are purple, and some unicorns are green. Therefore, all unicorns are both purple and green." contains a pseudo-statement in its premise (all unicorns are purple), rendering the conclusion invalid. =  论证“所有独角兽都是紫色的，有些独角兽是绿色的。因此，所有独角兽都是紫色和绿色的。”在其前提（所有独角兽都是紫色的）中包含一个伪语句，这使得结论无效。

In literature:
Some postmodern literature employs pseudo-statements to create a sense of absurdity or to challenge traditional notions of meaning and truth. =  一些后现代文学作品使用伪语句来营造荒谬感或挑战传统的意义和真理观念。
