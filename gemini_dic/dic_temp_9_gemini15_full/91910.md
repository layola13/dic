词源:

The word "hyperlustrous" combines the prefix "hyper-" (meaning "excessive," "above," or "beyond") with "lustrous" (meaning "shining").  "Lustrous" itself originates from the Old French word "lustrer" (to shine, polish), ultimately related to the Latin word "lux" (light).  Therefore, "hyperlustrous" literally means "excessively shining" or "beyond shining."
