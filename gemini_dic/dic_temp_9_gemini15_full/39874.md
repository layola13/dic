词源:
The word "consternation" comes from the Middle French word "consternacion," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "consternāre," meaning "to stun" or "to amaze."  The prefix "con-" implies "together," and "sternāre" is related to "sternere," meaning "to throw down," "to prostrate," or "to overwhelm."  Thus, the original sense points to a state of being completely overwhelmed or stunned.
