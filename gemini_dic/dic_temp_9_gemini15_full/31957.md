chemical bond:/ˈkɛmɪkl bɒnd/ | n. | 化学键 | A chemical bond is an attraction between atoms that allows the formation of chemical compounds.  These bonds are formed due to the electrostatic force of attraction between oppositely charged ions or due to the sharing of electrons between atoms. The type of bond formed depends on the electronegativity difference between the atoms involved. | Example:  The strong chemical bonds in diamond make it extremely hard.  金刚石中强大的化学键使其极其坚硬。  The weak hydrogen bonds in water are responsible for its high surface tension. 水中微弱的氢键是其高表面张力的原因。| 近义词: linkage, connection | 反义词:  separation, disconnection | 名词

WORD ORIGIN->

The term "chemical bond" is a modern scientific term that emerged with the development of modern chemistry in the 19th and 20th centuries.  It combines "chemical," derived from the word "chemistry" (ultimately from the Arabic "al-kimiya," meaning "alchemy"), and "bond," derived from the Old English "bindan," meaning "to bind."  The term accurately reflects the nature of the interaction, describing the attractive forces that bind atoms together.
