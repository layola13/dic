/pərˌsɪstɪvənəsɪz/ | n. | 坚持不懈；执着；毅力 | The word "persistivenesses" is the plural form of "persistiveness," which itself is a noun denoting the quality of being persistent.  It refers to multiple instances or examples of persistent behavior or attitude.  However,  using the plural "persistivenesses" is extremely uncommon and arguably grammatically awkward.  "Persistences" or simply "instances of persistence" would be far more natural. | Her persistivenesses in the face of adversity were remarkable.  她的坚韧不拔面对逆境令人称奇。(This sentence uses the word, but a better phrasing would be preferred).  The multiple attempts, each demonstrating persistivenesses, finally yielded success.  多次尝试，每一次都体现出坚持不懈的精神，最终取得了成功。(This sentence is also awkward;  a better phrasing would be needed). | persistences, tenacity, determination | surrender, giving up, apathy | noun
