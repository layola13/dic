PHRASE->
hydrosulphuric acid = 硫化氢酸
hydrosulphuric smell = 硫化氢气味
hydrosulphuric contamination = 硫化氢污染
hydrosulphuric exposure = 硫化氢暴露
hydrosulphuric poisoning = 硫化氢中毒


词源:
Hydro-  来自希腊语 "ὕδωρ" (hydōr)，意为“水”。
Sulphur- 来自拉丁语 "sulphur"，意为“硫”。
-ic  形容词后缀，表示“与…相关的”。

因此，hydrosulphuric 字面意思是“与水和硫相关的”。  但它特指硫化氢及其相关的化合物。
