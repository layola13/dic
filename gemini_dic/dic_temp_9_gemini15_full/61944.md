emulsifiabilities:/ɪˌmʌlsɪfɪəˈbɪlətiz/| n.|乳化能力，乳化性|The ability of a substance to form an emulsion.  This refers to the capacity of a substance to be emulsified or to emulsify other substances, creating a stable mixture of two immiscible liquids (like oil and water).|例句：The emulsifiabilities of different surfactants were compared in the experiment. 实验中比较了不同表面活性剂的乳化能力。

例句：The high emulsifiabilities of this ingredient make it ideal for use in cosmetic products.  这种成分的高乳化能力使其成为化妆品中理想的成分。


近义词：emulsification capacity, emulsibility|反义词：inability to emulsify, poor emulsification


词源：来自 emulsify (动词) + -abilities (名词后缀)  emulsify  源自 emulsion (乳状液) + -fy (动词后缀)。emulsion 最终源自拉丁语 emulsio，意为“牛奶”。
