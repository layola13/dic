词源:

praiseworthy is formed from the verb "praise" and the suffix "-worthy," which means "deserving of".  "Praise" itself comes from Old French "preiser" (to value, appraise), ultimately from Latin "pretium" (price, value).  "-worthy" is from Old English "-wyrþe," related to "worth."  Therefore, the word literally means "deserving of praise".
