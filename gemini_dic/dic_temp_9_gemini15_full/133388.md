词源：

The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adverb "facetiously" (meaning "jokingly" or "in a jesting manner").  "Facetious" itself derives from the Late Latin *facetiosus, from facetia "witty saying, jest," related to facetus "clever, witty," ultimately from facere "to do, make."


用法说明：

"Nonfacetiously" is used to emphasize that something is said or done seriously, without any intention of humor or jest.  It's often used to contrast a previous statement or action that might have been perceived as a joke.  It's a relatively formal word, and its usage depends on the context.  It's generally not used in casual conversation.
