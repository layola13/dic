近义词：indistinctly, unclearly, mumblingly, slurringly | 反义词：clearly, distinctly, articulately


词源:

* **pseudo-:**  From Greek *pseudo-* meaning "false," "sham," or "pretended."

* **articulately:** From  *articulate* (verb) meaning "to pronounce distinctly,"  itself derived from Latin *articulatus*, the past participle of *articulare*, "to join together," from *articulus*, "a joint."  The suffix *-ly* transforms the adjective into an adverb.

因此，pseudoarticulately字面意思是“虚假地清晰地表达”，这突出了其表达方式看似清晰，实则含糊不清的矛盾之处。
