词源:

From Old French *credence, from Latin *credentia, from credere "to believe."  The evolution reflects a shift in meaning from "belief" to "something believed," and then to the physical structures associated with religious belief. The meaning related to sideboards or buffets is a later extension, likely linked to the original meaning of a structure holding sacred items, suggesting a place of importance and display.
