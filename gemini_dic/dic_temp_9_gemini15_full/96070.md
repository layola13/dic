词源：

The word "indecorousness" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the noun "decorousness," which itself comes from the French word "décorum" and ultimately from the Latin word "decor," meaning "beauty," "grace," or "order."  Therefore, "indecorousness" literally means "lack of decorum" or "lack of propriety."


用法说明：

Indecorousness is typically used to describe actions or words that violate social norms or expectations of polite behavior.  The level of "indecorousness" is subjective and depends heavily on the specific cultural and social context.  Something considered indecorous in one situation might be perfectly acceptable in another.  The word carries a negative connotation, implying a lack of refinement or good taste.
