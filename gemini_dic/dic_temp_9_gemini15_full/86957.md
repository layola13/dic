词源：
The word "henchman" comes from Old English "hengestman," which literally translates to "horseman,"  or "groom."  Over time, the meaning shifted.  The original meaning referred to a stable hand or retainer, but the word evolved to describe a follower or supporter, often in a negative context. The modern usage often implies a sense of loyalty combined with a willingness to engage in unsavory activities on behalf of their superior.
