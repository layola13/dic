The word "redargutory" is not a word found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested.  It may be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a fictional language, or a technical term not widely known.  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more informed response.
