词源:  The word derives from the adjective "barbarous," ultimately from the Greek word "βάρβαρος" (barbaros), which originally referred to foreigners whose language was unintelligible—hence, sounding like "bar-bar." Over time, this came to mean uncivilized, cruel, or savage. The prefix "non-" negates this meaning.
