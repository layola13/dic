pro-Eskimo:/ˌproʊˈɛskɪmoʊ/| adj.| 亲爱斯基摩人的；支持斯基摩人的 |  A term used to express support for or solidarity with Inuit and other Arctic Indigenous peoples.  However, the term is now widely considered outdated and potentially offensive due to its historical association with colonial attitudes and the paternalistic implications of the prefix "pro-".  It's crucial to use more respectful and accurate terminology such as "Inuit rights" or "supporting Indigenous Arctic communities".|  The pro-Eskimo movement advocated for better living conditions for Inuit people. = 亲爱斯基摩人的运动倡导改善因纽特人的生活条件。  | 近义词: pro-Inuit, supporting Indigenous Arctic communities | 反义词: anti-Inuit, opposed to Indigenous Arctic rights | adj.
