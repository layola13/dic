词源:  The word is formed by adding the prefix "mis-" (meaning wrongly or badly) to the adjective "qualified."  "Qualified" itself derives from the verb "qualify," ultimately from the Latin "qualificare" (to make fit or suitable).  Therefore, "misqualified" literally means "wrongly or badly qualified."
