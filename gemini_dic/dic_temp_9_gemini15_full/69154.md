词源:
The word "faucet" comes from the Old French word "faucette," a diminutive of "fausset," meaning "small cask" or "bunghole."  The evolution reflects the early use of spigots and similar devices to control the flow of liquids from containers.  The meaning shifted to refer specifically to the plumbing fixture we know today.
