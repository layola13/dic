Etymology:

The word "epexegetical" comes from the Greek:

* **ἐπεξηγητικός (epexēgētikós):**  This Greek word is an adjective formed from the verb  ἐπεξηγέομαι (epexēgeomai), meaning "to explain further," "to expound."

* **ἐπί (epi):** upon, on, to, among
* **ἐξ (ex):** out of, from
* **ηγέομαι (hēgeomai):** to lead, guide, explain


The word thus literally translates to "explaining further" or "adding to the explanation."  It entered English through Latin and reflects a long-standing rhetorical device.
