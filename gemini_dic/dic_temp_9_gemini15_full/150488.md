词源:

The word "pantisocratist" is derived from "pantisocracy," a compound word coined in the late 18th century.  "Pan-" means "all" or "every," "iso-" means "equal," and "-cracy" means "rule" or "government." Therefore, pantisocracy literally means "rule by all equals," or a system of government where everyone is equal.  "Pantisocratist" is simply the agent noun describing a believer or advocate of this system.
