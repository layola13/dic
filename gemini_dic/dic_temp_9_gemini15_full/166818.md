presprinkles: /ˈpriːsprɪŋkəlz/ | n. | 预先撒上，预先洒上 |  The act of sprinkling something beforehand;  preliminary sprinkling.  This word is not a standard dictionary entry and appears to be a newly coined word, combining "pre-" (before) and "sprinkles" (small drops of liquid).  Therefore, a formal definition and usage examples are limited.  It implies the action of sprinkling something before another event or process. | 例句：The baker did presprinkles of cinnamon on the dough before adding the other ingredients.  烘焙师在加入其他配料之前先在面团上撒上肉桂粉。  The chef did presprinkles of olive oil on the vegetables before roasting.厨师在烤蔬菜之前先撒上橄榄油。 | 近义词：pre-application, pre-treatment (in a related context) | 反义词：post-sprinkling, after-application
