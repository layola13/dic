mantissa:/mænˈtɪsə/| n. |尾数，小数部分 |The mantissa is the part of a logarithm that follows the characteristic.  It represents the fractional part of the logarithm. For example, in the logarithm 2.3010, the mantissa is 0.3010.  In computer science, mantissa often refers to the fractional part of a floating-point number. |Example: The mantissa of the logarithm 3.4771 is 0.4771.  The mantissa of the floating-point number 1.234e5 is 1.234. |近义词：fractional part (in the context of logarithms), significand (in the context of floating-point numbers) |反义词：characteristic (in the context of logarithms) |


词源:  The word "mantissa" originates from the Late Latin word *mantissa*, meaning "something added," a diminutive of *manus* ("hand"). Its use in mathematics arose from its original meaning in grammar, referring to a supplementary addition to a text.  The connection is that the mantissa is the part added to the characteristic to complete the logarithm.


用法说明:

The term "mantissa" has slightly different meanings depending on the context:

1. **In logarithms:** The mantissa is the decimal part of a logarithm.  The logarithm is typically expressed as a whole number (characteristic) plus a decimal fraction (mantissa).  For base-10 logarithms, the characteristic indicates the power of 10, while the mantissa represents the value of the logarithm between 0 and 1.

2. **In floating-point numbers:** In computer science, the mantissa (also called significand) is the part of a floating-point number that represents the significant digits.  It's combined with an exponent to express a number in scientific notation. For example, in the floating-point number 1.23 x 10^4, the mantissa is 1.23 and the exponent is 4.


例句:

* **Logarithms:** The mantissa of log₁₀(200) is the same as the mantissa of log₁₀(2) because both have the same fractional part after the decimal point. = log₁₀(200)和log₁₀(2)的小数部分（尾数）相同，因为它们的小数点后都有相同的分数部分。

* **Floating-point numbers:** The mantissa in a single-precision floating-point number has a limited number of bits, which affects the precision of the number. = 单精度浮点数的尾数位数有限，这会影响数字的精度。


There are no common phrases directly using "mantissa" as a core element. Its usage is primarily technical within the contexts of mathematics and computer science.
