The word "ectental" is not a valid English word.  There is no entry for it in any standard English dictionary or lexicon.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  If you could provide the intended word or more context, I can offer a more helpful response.
