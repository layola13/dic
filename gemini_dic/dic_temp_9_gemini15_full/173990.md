用法说明：

"Quasi-superficially" is an adverb that describes an action or state as appearing superficial, but with the implication that there might be more to it than initially meets the eye. It suggests a lack of thoroughness or depth, but not necessarily a complete absence of substance.  The "quasi-" prefix softens the judgment, indicating that the superficiality is only apparent or partial.  It is a relatively uncommon word, used in more formal contexts where subtle nuances of meaning are important.  It's often used to describe analyses, assessments, or understandings that seem shallow at first glance but may have hidden complexities.
