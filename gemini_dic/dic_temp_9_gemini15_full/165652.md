premodeled: /ˌpriːˈmɒdəld/ | adj. | 预先建模的，预先设计的 |  Describes something that has been modeled or designed beforehand, often using computer software or other tools to create a digital representation before physical creation.  It implies a level of planning and preparation before the actual implementation. | Example: The premodeled components were easily assembled. 预先建模的组件很容易组装。 The architect presented a premodeled design of the building. 建筑师展示了一个预先设计的建筑模型。|近义词: pre-designed, pre-planned, prefabricated | 反义词: improvised, impromptu, ad hoc |
