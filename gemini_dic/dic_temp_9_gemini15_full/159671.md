词源:  The word "polyacrylic" is a combination of "poly-" (meaning "many" or "multiple") and "acrylic," which refers to acrylic acid and its derivatives.  Acrylic acid itself is derived from acrolein, a compound discovered in the early 19th century. The development of polyacrylic resins as synthetic materials occurred in the 20th century.
