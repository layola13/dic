词源:
The word "deinternationalized" is formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "reverse") to the word "internationalized."  "Internationalized" itself is derived from "international," a combination of "inter-" (between) and "national" (of a nation).  Therefore, "deinternationalized" means to reverse the process of making something international.
