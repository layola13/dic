词源:  The word "ineluctability" is derived from the Latin prefix "in-" (not, without), "e-" (out), "luc" (to shine, to be clear), and the suffix "-ability" (capable of).  The root "luc" is related to the word "lucid," meaning clear or transparent.  The original sense implied something that could not be escaped or avoided, hence the current meaning of inevitability.  The word evolved through Old French and Middle English before reaching its modern form.
