词源:
The word "demirep" is a shortened form of "demi-reputation," with "demi" meaning "half" and "reputation" referring to one's public image or standing.  It therefore literally means "half-reputation," implying a reputation that is partially good and partially bad, or more specifically, a reputation damaged by sexual impropriety.
