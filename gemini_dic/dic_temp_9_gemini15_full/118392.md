meroblast:/ˈmɜːrəʊblæst/ | n. | 胞质卵 | A meroblast is a type of egg cell in which cleavage (cell division) is incomplete, resulting in a  blastoderm (a layer of cells) covering only part of the yolk.  This is in contrast to a holoblast, where the entire egg divides.  The type of meroblastic cleavage depends on the amount of yolk present in the egg. | Example:  Many birds and reptiles exhibit meroblastic cleavage due to their large yolky eggs.  | 近义词:telolecithal egg (partially describing the yolk distribution)| 反义词: holoblast |
