词源:
The word "mechanicalization" is derived from the noun "mechanism" and the suffix "-ization," which indicates the process of making something into a particular state.  "Mechanism" itself comes from the Greek word "mēkhanē" (μηχανή), meaning "machine" or "contrivance".  Therefore, "mechanicalization" literally means "the process of becoming machine-like" or "the introduction of machines."
