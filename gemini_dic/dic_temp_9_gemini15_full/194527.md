self-sedimented:/ˌsɛlfˈsɛdɪmɛntɪd/| adj.| 自沉降的 |  Describes a process or substance where sedimentation occurs without external intervention; the particles settle out of a suspension due to their own weight and density.  | Example: The self-sedimented clay layer was clearly visible in the core sample.  自沉降的粘土层在岩心样品中清晰可见。 |近义词：self-deposited, naturally settled | 反义词： artificially settled, mechanically separated
