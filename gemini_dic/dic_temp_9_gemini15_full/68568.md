The word "fangot" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a slang term or regional dialect word:** If so, please provide more context (where you encountered the word, who used it, etc.) to help me understand its meaning.
* **It's a neologism (newly coined word):**  If it's a recently invented word, there won't be any information in standard dictionaries yet.  Again, context is crucial.

Please provide more information so I can assist you better.
