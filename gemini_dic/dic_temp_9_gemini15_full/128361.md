neutron-bombs:/ˈnjuːtrɒn bɒmz/|/ˈnjuːtrɑːn bɑːmz/| n. |中子弹|A neutron bomb is a small thermonuclear weapon designed to maximize the lethal effects of neutron radiation while minimizing the destructive blast and heat effects. This results in a weapon that can kill people and animals within a certain radius, while causing less damage to buildings and infrastructure.  The high-energy neutrons emitted by the bomb are extremely effective at killing living things, even at distances where the blast wave might not be lethal.|The use of neutron bombs is a controversial topic, raising serious ethical concerns.  Some argue that they are a "clean" weapon, but this view is challenged by the long-term effects of radiation on the environment and human health.|近义词：enhanced radiation weapon|反义词：conventional bomb
