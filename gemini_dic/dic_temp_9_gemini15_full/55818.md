Etymology:

The word "divesture" comes from the verb "divest," which itself originates from the Old French word "desvestir," meaning "to undress" or "to strip."  The prefix "de-" indicates removal or separation, while the root "-vestir" relates to clothing or covering.  Over time, the meaning shifted from the literal act of removing clothing to the figurative act of stripping away assets, holdings, or responsibilities.
