词源:

From Latin *repudiāre "to divorce, reject, refuse", from *re- "back" + *pudiāre "to feel shame", from *pudor "shame".


用法说明:

Repudiant is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that is rejected, denied, or refused.  It often implies a strong rejection, not simply a disagreement.  It carries a sense of formally or decisively rejecting something.

It's less common than synonyms like "rejecting," "denying," or "disowning," but adds a stronger connotation of formal rejection or disavowal.
