contraposition:/ˌkɒntrəpəˈzɪʃən/ /ˌkɑːntrəpəˈzɪʃən/| n. |对照；反证法；对立|The act of placing things side by side for the purpose of comparison; in logic, a method of proof that establishes the truth of a statement by showing that the opposite leads to a contradiction.  It involves switching the hypothesis and conclusion of a conditional statement and negating both.|Example: The contraposition of "If it's raining, then the ground is wet" is "If the ground is not wet, then it's not raining." This demonstrates that contraposition is a valid form of argument.|近义词：opposition, contrast, antithesis|反义词：confirmation, corroboration
