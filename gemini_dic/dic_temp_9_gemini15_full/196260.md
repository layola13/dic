词源:
The word "serenade" comes from the Italian word "serenata," which in turn comes from the Latin word "serenus," meaning "calm" or "clear."  Originally, a serenade referred to a piece of music performed outdoors in the evening, often under a clear sky.  The meaning evolved to include the act of performing such music.
