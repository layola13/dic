词源:

The word "casehardened" originates from the metallurgical process of case hardening, where the surface of steel is made extremely hard to resist wear.  The metaphorical extension to describe a person's emotional state reflects this idea of an outer shell of hardness protecting a potentially softer interior.  "Case" refers to the outer surface, and "hardened" means made hard or resistant.
