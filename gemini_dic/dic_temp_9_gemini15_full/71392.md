词源:
From the Latin word *flagrans*, meaning "burning" or "blazing,"  referring to something obvious and conspicuous.  The suffix "-ancy" denotes a state or quality.  The connection lies in the idea that something flagrant is so obvious and noticeable, like a burning fire, that it cannot be ignored.
