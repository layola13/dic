The word "shendra" is not found in standard English dictionaries or etymology resources.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (like a name or place), a word from a dialect or a newly coined word.  To provide the analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (book, conversation, website, etc.)
* **What was the surrounding text or conversation?**  This would help determine the meaning and potential origins.

Without this information, I cannot provide the requested details including pronunciation, part of speech, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical examples.
