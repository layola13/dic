词源:

The word "enduringnesses" is derived from the adjective "enduring," which comes from the verb "endure."  "Endure" ultimately originates from the Old French word "endurer," meaning "to last, to bear."  The "-ness" suffix is added to create the noun form, signifying the state or quality of being enduring.  Therefore, "enduringnesses" represents the plural form of the noun indicating multiple instances of lasting, persistence, or resilience.
