monocline:/ˈmɒnəklaɪn/| n. |单斜层, 单斜构造|A monocline is a geological formation where rock layers are inclined in one direction, forming a step-like structure.  It's characterized by a relatively uniform dip of strata over a considerable distance, followed by a return to horizontal or nearly horizontal bedding. Unlike a fold, a monocline doesn't involve a complete bending or warping of the rock layers. |The monocline in the Grand Canyon is a significant geological feature. |近义词: inclined strata, tilted strata |反义词:  horizontal strata, unfolded strata

USAGE->
一般现在时:

过去完成时:
Erosion had already significantly altered the monocline before the study began. = 在研究开始之前，侵蚀已经显著改变了单斜层。
The tectonic activity had created the monocline millions of years ago. = 数百万年前，构造活动形成了单斜层。


将来时:
Further research will investigate the monocline's stability. = 后续研究将调查单斜层的稳定性。

疑问句:
What type of rock makes up this monocline? = 这种单斜层是由什么类型的岩石构成的？
Where is the monocline located geographically? = 单斜层位于哪个地理位置？


否定句:
The monocline is not a simple geological structure. = 单斜层并非简单的地质构造。
This formation is not a monocline; it's a fault. = 这种地层不是单斜层；它是断层。
