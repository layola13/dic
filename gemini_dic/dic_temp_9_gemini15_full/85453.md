hashmap:/ˈhæʃmæp/| n. |哈希映射，哈希表 |A hash map (also called a hash table) is a data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.  It uses a hash function to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. | Example:  We used a hashmap to store and quickly retrieve user data. 我们使用哈希映射来存储和快速检索用户数据。|近义词：hash table, associative array|反义词：无


USAGE->
HashMaps are not typically used in sentences like "hello" is.  They are used in programming contexts.  The following examples demonstrate how hashmaps are used in code.  Note that these are illustrative examples and syntax may vary slightly depending on the programming language.


Example in Java:
```java
HashMap<String, Integer> ages = new HashMap<>();
ages.put("Alice", 30);
ages.put("Bob", 25);
int aliceAge = ages.get("Alice"); // aliceAge will be 30
```

Example in Python:
```python
ages = {"Alice": 30, "Bob": 25}
alice_age = ages["Alice"] # alice_age will be 30
```

These examples show how to create a hashmap (or dictionary in Python), add key-value pairs, and retrieve values based on their keys.  There's no conjugation or tense as with verbs.


PHRASE->
HashMap is rarely used in phrases outside of programming contexts.  The following are some programming-related phrases involving HashMaps (or equivalent data structures):


create a hashmap: 创建一个哈希映射
access a hashmap: 访问哈希映射
iterate over a hashmap: 遍历哈希映射
search a hashmap: 搜索哈希映射
the size of a hashmap: 哈希映射的大小
