词源:
The word "clench" comes from the Middle English word "clenchen," which means "to close tightly." This word ultimately derives from the Old English word "clyngian," meaning "to cling."  The evolution reflects a semantic shift from a general sense of clinging to a more specific sense of tight closure.
