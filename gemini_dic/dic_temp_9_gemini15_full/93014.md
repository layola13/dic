词源:

The word "idiotcy" is derived from the word "idiot," which ultimately comes from the Greek word "ἰδιώτης" (idiōtēs), meaning "private person" or "layman."  In ancient Greece, an idiōtēs was someone who was not involved in public life, suggesting a lack of worldly knowledge and experience.  Over time, the word's meaning shifted to denote someone lacking intellectual ability, and eventually to its current pejorative sense.  The suffix "-cy" is added to nouns to form abstract nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.

用法说明:

Idiotcy is a strong and often harsh term. It is generally used to express strong disapproval of incredibly foolish behavior.  While it can be used descriptively, it is usually employed in a critical or even contemptuous manner.  Using it in formal writing or conversation should be done cautiously, as it can be considered offensive.  Milder alternatives are often preferred.
