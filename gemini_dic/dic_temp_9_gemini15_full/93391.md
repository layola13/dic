The word "illighten" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word not yet widely adopted.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  To help you, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered this word.
