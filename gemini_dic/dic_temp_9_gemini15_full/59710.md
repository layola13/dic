词源:

The word "eclectic" comes from the Greek word "eklektikos," meaning "selective," "choosing," or "picking out."  It ultimately derives from "eklegein," meaning "to select" or "to pick out."  The term was initially used in philosophy to describe a school of thought that selected elements from various philosophical systems.  Its modern usage broadened to encompass a wider range of applications, including art, music, and design.
