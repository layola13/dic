词源:

The word "disserviceable" is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "the opposite of") and the adjective "serviceable," which means "useful" or "helpful."  Therefore, "disserviceable" literally means "not serviceable."  The root "serv-" comes from the Latin word *servire*, meaning "to serve."
