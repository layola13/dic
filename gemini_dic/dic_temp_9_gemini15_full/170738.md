词源:

The word is a combination of:

* **pseudo-**: a prefix meaning "false," "sham," or "pretended."  It comes from the Greek word ψευδής (pseudēs) meaning "false."

* **assertively**: an adverb derived from the adjective "assertive," meaning "confident and forceful in expressing one's opinions."  This comes from the verb "assert," which itself comes from the Latin verb *assertus*, the past participle of *adserere* "to affirm, claim, assert."
