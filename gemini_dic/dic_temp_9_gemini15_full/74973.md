fricative:/ˈfrɪkətɪv/| n. |摩擦音|A fricative is a consonant sound produced by forcing air through a narrow channel in the vocal tract, creating friction.

Examples of fricatives in English include /f/, /v/, /θ/, /ð/, /s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /h/.|The 's' in 'sun' is a fricative. The 'f' in 'fish' is also a fricative.|近义词：spirant (less common)|反义词：plosive, stop
