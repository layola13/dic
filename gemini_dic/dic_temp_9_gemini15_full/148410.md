词源:

The word "overstayed" is formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "beyond" or "exceeding") and the verb "stayed" (the past tense of "stay").  Therefore, it literally means "to stay beyond."  The verb "stay" itself has Old English roots, ultimately deriving from words meaning "to remain" or "to abide."
