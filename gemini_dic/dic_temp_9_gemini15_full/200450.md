/ˈslæɡləsnəsɪz/ | n. |  渣滓的缺乏；无渣状态 | The word "slaglessnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a nonce word, meaning it's coined for a specific occasion and is not found in dictionaries.  It's formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" (implying multiple states or qualities) to "slaglessness," which itself is not a common word.  "Slaglessness" would imply the absence of slag (a waste product, often glassy or vitreous, produced during smelting or other metallurgical processes). Therefore, "slaglessnesses" would theoretically refer to multiple instances or aspects of this absence of slag. However, due to its unusual nature, there are no standard examples or phrases using this word.  There's no established meaning beyond its literal interpretation based on word formation. |  No example sentences exist in standard usage. | 近义词:  (This is difficult to provide accurate synonyms due to the word's rarity.  One might consider contextual synonyms referring to purity, cleanliness, or refinement depending on the context in which it might be used.) | 反义词: (Similarly, antonyms would depend on context.  Words like "slagginess," "impurity," or "contamination" might be considered opposite in concept but not direct antonyms.) | noun
