interfertility: /ˌɪntərˌfɜːrˈtɪləti/ | n. | 互育性，杂交可育性 | The ability of individuals from different populations or species to successfully interbreed and produce fertile offspring.  It refers to the degree to which different populations or species can successfully reproduce with each other.  High interfertility suggests close genetic relatedness, while low interfertility indicates greater genetic divergence. | Example: The high interfertility between these two subspecies suggests a recent divergence.  这两种亚种之间高度的互育性表明它们最近才分化。


近义词: cross-fertility, hybrid fertility | 反义词: sterility, infertility
