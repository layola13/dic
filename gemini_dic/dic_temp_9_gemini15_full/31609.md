词源:

The word "chastisement" comes from the Old French word *chasticement*, which itself derives from the verb *chastier*. This verb ultimately traces back to the Latin word *castigare*, meaning "to purify," "to correct," or "to punish."  The original sense of purification suggests a cleansing or correcting action, which evolved into the modern understanding of punishment.
