runtishnesses:/ˈrʌntɪʃnəsɪz/| n. |矮小粗鲁的行为或举止|The word "runtishnesses" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a nonce word, created by adding the suffix "-nesses" to "runtish," which itself describes someone or something that is runt-like, meaning small and under-developed.  Therefore, "runtishnesses" would refer to the collective characteristics or instances of being runt-like, possibly implying petty, insignificant, or underdeveloped actions or behaviors.|例句：There is no standard usage example as this is not a standard word.  One might *hypothetically* construct a sentence like:  "His constant complaints and minor acts of sabotage were merely runtishnesses, unworthy of serious consideration." = 他不断抱怨和进行的小破坏行为只是些鸡毛蒜皮的小事，不值得认真对待。|近义词:pettinesses, trivialities, insignificances |反义词:magnificences, grandiosity, importance|名词
