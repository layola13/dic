词源:
The word "gulfing" comes from the noun "gulf," meaning a large area of sea or ocean partly enclosed by land.  The verb use extends this meaning to suggest being overwhelmed or swallowed up, as if by a large body of water.  The etymology of "gulf" itself traces back to the Old French "golfe" and ultimately to the Arabic "khaleej," meaning a "bay" or "gulf."
