词源:  The word "impenetrably" is derived from the prefix "im-" (meaning "not"), "penetrable" (meaning "capable of being penetrated"), and the suffix "-ly" (forming an adverb).  "Penetrable" itself comes from the Latin word "penetrabilis," which is derived from "penetrare," meaning "to penetrate."  Therefore, "impenetrably" literally means "not capable of being penetrated."
