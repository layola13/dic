listerias:/lɪˈstɪəriəz/| n. |李斯特菌属（复数）| Listerias refers to the plural form of the genus Listeria, a group of bacteria.  These bacteria are facultative anaerobic, meaning they can survive with or without oxygen.  Some species within this genus are pathogenic, causing the disease listeriosis. |Example:  Studies on listerias have revealed various virulence factors contributing to their pathogenicity.  李斯特菌属的研究揭示了导致其致病性的各种毒力因子。|近义词:Listeria (单数)|反义词:无
