词源:  The word derives from the adjective "dismaying," which in turn comes from the verb "dismay."  "Dismay" itself is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away from" or "negative") and "may," an older form of "amaze" meaning to "overwhelm with astonishment or terror."  Therefore, "dismay" originally meant to remove or deprive someone of their courage or confidence.  The "-ingly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner or way in which something happens.
