cap-in-hand: /ˌkæpɪnˈhænd/ | adj. | 毕恭毕敬地；低声下气地；低声下气地请求 | Extremely humble and submissive; begging humbly.  It describes someone who is excessively polite and deferential, often because they are asking for a favor or seeking help in a desperate or needy situation.

近义词：humble, submissive, supplicating, pleading, begging, fawning

反义词：arrogant, assertive, demanding, imperious, self-assured

词源:

The phrase originates from the historical practice of removing one's hat (cap) as a sign of respect or deference, particularly when approaching someone of higher social standing or authority.  Holding the cap in one's hand further emphasized this humility. The gesture signified submission and a willingness to accept whatever the other person decided.  The idiom evolved to describe the attitude and demeanor of someone in a state of humble supplication, regardless of whether they are literally holding a cap.
