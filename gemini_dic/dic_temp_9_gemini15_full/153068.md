词源:
The word "peerlessness" is derived from the word "peer," meaning equal, and the suffix "-less," indicating lack of or without.  Therefore, "peerlessness" literally means "without equals" or "having no peers."  The evolution reflects a shift from a simple negation of equals to a connotation of exceptional superiority.
