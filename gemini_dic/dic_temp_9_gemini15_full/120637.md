词源:
The word "mis-measured" is formed by the prefix "mis-" (meaning wrongly or badly) and the past participle "measured" of the verb "to measure".  The root of "measure" traces back to Old French *mesurer, from Latin *mensūrāre, from *mensus, past participle of *metiri "to measure, mete out".  The Latin root is related to words like "mensurate" and "dimension".
