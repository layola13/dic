The word "houtou" is not an English word.  It appears to be a transliteration of a word from another language, likely Chinese.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis in the requested format using English linguistic principles.  To provide a proper analysis, I would need to know the language of origin and the word's meaning and usage within that language.
