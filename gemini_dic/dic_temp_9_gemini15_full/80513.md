词源:  The term combines "good ol' boys," a colloquial Southern U.S. term of endearment for close male friends, with the connotation of an informal, often exclusive, and powerful social group.  The "ol'" is a shortened form of "old," reflecting a sense of tradition and established relationships.  The term gained negative connotations over time, as it became associated with corruption, cronyism, and the exclusion of marginalized groups from power structures.
