词源:

The word "inadvertently" comes from the Old French word "inadvertent,"  which is a combination of the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and "advertent" (meaning "heedful" or "attentive").  "Advertent" itself derives from the Latin verb "advertere," meaning "to turn towards," implying paying attention.  Therefore, "inadvertent" originally meant "not paying attention," and "inadvertently" means "without paying attention," or accidentally.
