词源:
From the French word *dragon*, meaning "soldier," ultimately derived from the Latin word *draconem* (nominative *draco*), meaning "dragon."  The original sense referred to the harsh discipline of dragoons (a type of mounted infantry).  The meaning evolved to encompass the general act of forcing someone to do something against their will.
