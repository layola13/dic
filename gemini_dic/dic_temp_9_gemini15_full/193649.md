self-catalysts: /ˌsɛlfˈkætəlɪsts/ | n. | 自催化剂 |  A substance that acts as a catalyst for its own formation or a reaction in which it is a reactant.  Self-catalysts are crucial in certain chemical processes where the product of a reaction accelerates the reaction itself. This phenomenon often leads to autocatalytic reactions, which exhibit exponential growth or decay.


例句：

The polymerization of styrene is an example of a reaction that can be self-catalyzed by the polymer itself.  聚苯乙烯的聚合反应就是一个例子，它可以被聚合物自身自催化。


The autocatalytic reaction of self-replicating molecules could have been crucial in the origin of life. 自复制分子的自催化反应可能对生命起源至关重要。
