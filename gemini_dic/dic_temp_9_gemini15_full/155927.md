photodimer:/ˈfoʊtoʊdaɪmər/| n. |光二聚体|A photodimer is a dimer formed by the photochemical reaction of two identical molecules.  This reaction typically involves the formation of a new covalent bond between the two molecules, often initiated by ultraviolet (UV) light.  Photodimers are commonly observed in organic molecules containing unsaturated bonds, such as alkenes and aromatic compounds.  The process is reversible under certain conditions, often with the application of heat or light of a different wavelength. |Example: The formation of a cyclobutane ring from two alkene molecules is a classic example of photodimerization.|近义词：cyclobutane (in the case of alkene photodimerization)|反义词：monomer (its constituent part)


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in chemistry and related scientific fields, and does not have common usage in everyday conversation or various tenses as in the example.  Therefore, tense conjugations are not applicable in the same way as for a common verb.  The term describes a chemical product resulting from a specific reaction.

PHRASE->
Photodimer formation,  photodimerization reaction,  intramolecular photodimer,  intermolecular photodimer,  photodimer cleavage
