词源:
The word "severe" comes from the Old French word "sever," meaning "strict," "serious," or "austere."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "severus," having the same basic meaning.  The evolution reflects a consistent semantic trajectory from a sense of seriousness and strictness to the modern understanding of intensity and gravity.
