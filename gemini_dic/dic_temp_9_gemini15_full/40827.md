词源:
Derived from the verb "convulse," meaning to shake violently with spasms or convulsions. The suffix "-edly" transforms the verb into an adverb, indicating the manner in which an action is performed.  The root can be traced back to the Latin word "convellere," meaning "to pull together violently" or "to convulse."
