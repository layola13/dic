词源:

The word "comprisal" is derived from the verb "comprise," meaning "to include or contain."  The suffix "-al" transforms the verb into a noun, signifying the act or result of comprising.  "Comprise" itself comes from the Old French "comprendre," meaning "to comprehend" or "to contain."


用法说明：


"Comprisal" is a relatively uncommon word, often used in formal or technical contexts. It emphasizes the act of bringing together different elements to form a whole.  While "composition" or "constitution" might be more frequently used synonyms, "comprisal" highlights the process of assembling the components.
