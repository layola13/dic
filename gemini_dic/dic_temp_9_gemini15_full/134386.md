词源:
The word "nonintervention" is a compound word formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "intervention" (meaning "the action or process of intervening").  "Intervention" itself comes from the Latin word "intervenire," meaning "to come between," formed from "inter" (between) and "venire" (to come).  Therefore, nonintervention literally means "not coming between."
