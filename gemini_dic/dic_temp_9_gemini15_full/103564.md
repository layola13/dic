The term "John Bull" itself is a personification of England, analogous to "Uncle Sam" for the United States.  The origin is traced back to the early 18th century, with various theories about its precise etymology. One popular belief links it to John Bull, a character in a series of satirical prints and pamphlets by John Arbuthnot in the early 1700s. These works depicted Bull as a wealthy but somewhat simple and stubborn Englishman, representing the national character in a humorous way. The imagery of John Bull was subsequently adopted and popularized widely, solidifying its place in British cultural identity.
