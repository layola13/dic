词源:

The word "ricketiness" is derived from the adjective "rickety," which ultimately traces back to the Middle English word "ricket," meaning "a rack," "a frame," or "something that is easily shaken."  This likely refers to the unsteady nature of things built with such frames.  The "-iness" suffix adds the sense of a quality or state.

用法说明:

"Ricketiness" is used to describe something that is unstable, shaky, or likely to fall apart.  It often implies a lack of strength or firmness in the structure or constitution of something.  It can apply to both physical objects and systems or situations.
