近义词：virtuously, justly, uprightly, morally, piously


反义词：wickedly, unjustly, immorally, unrighteously


词源:  The word derives from the adjective "righteous," meaning morally right or just.  "Righteous" itself comes from the Old English "rihtwis," composed of "riht" (right) and "wis" (wise).  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner or way in which something is done.
