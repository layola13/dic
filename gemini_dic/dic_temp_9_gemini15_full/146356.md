overfitting:/ˌoʊvərˈfɪtɪŋ/ | n. | 过拟合 | The phenomenon where a machine learning model learns the training data too well, including the noise and outliers, resulting in poor generalization to new, unseen data.  It essentially memorizes the training data instead of learning the underlying patterns.  This leads to high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the test set. |  The model showed signs of overfitting, performing exceptionally well on the training data but poorly on the unseen test data.  |  Overtraining, memorization |  Underfitting, generalization | 名词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex. = 过拟合发生在模型过于复杂的时候。
The model overfits the training data. = 模型对训练数据过拟合。


一般过去时:
The previous model overfitted the data. = 上一个模型对数据过拟合了。
Overfitting significantly reduced the model's accuracy. = 过拟合显著降低了模型的准确性。


现在完成时:
The researchers have addressed the overfitting problem. = 研究人员已经解决了过拟合问题。
We have observed overfitting in several experiments. = 我们在几个实验中观察到了过拟合现象。


过去完成时:
They had already identified the overfitting before the presentation. = 他们在演示之前就已经发现了过拟合问题。
The team had struggled with overfitting for months. = 该团队已经与过拟合作斗争了好几个月。


将来时:
We will prevent overfitting by using regularization techniques. = 我们将通过使用正则化技术来防止过拟合。
The new algorithm will likely reduce overfitting. = 新算法可能会减少过拟合。


虚拟语气:
If we had used more data, we might have avoided overfitting. = 如果我们使用了更多的数据，我们可能就避免了过拟合。
I wish the model hadn't overfitted the training set. = 我希望模型没有对训练集过拟合。


被动语态:
Overfitting was identified as the primary cause of the error. = 过拟合被认定为错误的主要原因。
The problem of overfitting is being actively researched. = 过拟合问题正在被积极研究。


疑问句:
Is overfitting a problem in this model? = 这个模型存在过拟合问题吗？
How can we avoid overfitting? = 我们如何避免过拟合？


否定句:
The model did not overfit the training data. = 模型没有对训练数据过拟合。
This approach does not suffer from overfitting. = 这种方法不会出现过拟合。


PHRASE->
overfitting problem = 过拟合问题
avoid overfitting = 避免过拟合
reduce overfitting = 减少过拟合
overfitting in machine learning = 机器学习中的过拟合
signs of overfitting = 过拟合迹象
