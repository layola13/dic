USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the field of prosody (the study of poetic meter and rhythm).  Therefore, typical grammatical tenses and moods are not directly applicable.  Instead, examples illustrate its use in describing poetic meter.

Example 1:  The line "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" is analyzed as containing several dipodies. =  诗句“我将把你比作夏日？”被分析为包含多个双音步。

Example 2:  Identifying the dipodies in a poem helps understand its rhythmic structure. = 识别诗歌中的双音步有助于理解其节奏结构。

iambic pentameter:  抑扬五音步
dactylic hexameter:  长短短六音步
trochaic tetrameter:  短长四音步
