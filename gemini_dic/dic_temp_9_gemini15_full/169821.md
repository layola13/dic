词源:

The word "proscriptionist" is derived from the noun "proscription"  (the action of forbidding something; a ban) + the suffix "-ist" (denoting a person who does something or belongs to a group).  The root ultimately comes from the Latin "proscribere," meaning "to write before," "to denounce publicly," or "to outlaw."
