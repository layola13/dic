galvanograph:/ɡælˈvænəɡræf/| n. |电刻图; 电刻机|A galvanograph is a device that uses electricity to create an etched image, typically on a metallic surface.  It's an early form of electrochemical etching used for reproduction of images.  The process involves using an electric current to transfer an image from a master plate to a receiving plate.|The artist used a galvanograph to reproduce the intricate details of the botanical illustration.|近义词：electrograph |反义词：None specifically, but related to photographic processes
