词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "satiric" (derived from "satire").  "Satire" ultimately comes from the Latin word "satura," meaning "a medley" or "a dish of mixed fruits," later evolving to refer to a literary genre using humor and irony to criticize.
