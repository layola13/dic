词源:
The word "colour-blind" is a compound word.  "Colour" comes from the Old French "color," ultimately from the Latin "color," meaning "appearance, complexion, colour."  "Blind" comes from the Old English "blind," meaning "unable to see."  The combination signifies a deficiency in colour perception.
