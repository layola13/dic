词源:
The word "saucebox" is believed to have originated in the 17th century.  The "sauce" element likely refers to impudence or cheekiness, while "box" may refer to someone's ears (as in "boxing someone's ears" – a form of punishment).  Therefore, a "saucebox" is literally someone who deserves a box on the ears for their impertinence.  The precise etymology is uncertain, but the meaning clearly evolved from a physical punishment to a descriptive term for a cheeky person.
