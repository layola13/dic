词源:

The word "noncompliances" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "compliances," which refers to the act of conforming to a rule, regulation, or standard.  The root word "comply" comes from the Old French "complaisir," meaning "to please."  Therefore, noncompliance literally means "not pleasing" or "not conforming."
