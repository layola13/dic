词源:

The word "indirection" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not" or "in") + "direction,"  which ultimately comes from the Old French word "directioun" and the Latin word "directio," meaning "guidance" or "a pointing out." Therefore, "indirection" literally means "not a straight pointing out" or "a lack of straight guidance."
