词源:
The word "nanofiber" is a compound word.  "Nano" comes from the Greek word "νάνος" (nánōs), meaning "dwarf," referring to the nanometer scale (one billionth of a meter). "Fiber" is from Old French "fibre," ultimately from Latin "fibra," meaning "fiber, thread."  Therefore, "nanofiber" literally means a very fine fiber at the nanoscale.
