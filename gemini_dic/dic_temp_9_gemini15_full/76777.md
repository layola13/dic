gametically: /ɡəˈmɛtɪkli/ | adv. | 遗传地，配子地 | Relating to or characteristic of gametes (reproductive cells).  | Example: The disease is transmitted gametically, meaning it's passed down through the sperm or egg cells.  这种疾病是通过遗传途径传播的，这意味着它通过精子或卵细胞遗传下来。 | 近义词：genetically | 反义词：somatically (体细胞地)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The trait is expressed gametically. =  性状以配子方式表达。
Gametes transmit genetic information gametically. = 配子以遗传方式传递遗传信息。


一般过去时:
The scientists studied how the gene was passed gametically. = 科学家们研究了基因是如何通过遗传方式传递的。
The disease was shown to be transmitted gametically. =  该病被证明是通过遗传方式传播的。


现在完成时:
Researchers have confirmed that the mutation has been passed down gametically. = 研究人员已经证实，这种突变已经通过遗传方式遗传下来。
Scientists have observed gametic transmission in many species. = 科学家们在许多物种中观察到配子遗传。


过去完成时:
It was discovered that the gene had already been altered gametically. = 人们发现该基因已经通过遗传方式改变了。
Before the study, it had been assumed the trait was not passed gametically. = 在这项研究之前，人们认为该性状不是通过遗传方式传递的。


将来时:
The researchers will investigate how the gene will be expressed gametically. = 研究人员将研究该基因将如何通过遗传方式表达。
We will examine if the genetic marker is transmitted gametically. = 我们将检查遗传标记是否通过遗传方式传递。


虚拟语气:
If the trait were gametically inherited, we would expect to see... = 如果该性状是通过遗传方式遗传的，我们预计会看到……
It is unlikely that the trait would be passed gametically if it were environmental. = 如果该性状是环境因素导致的，它不太可能通过遗传方式传递。


被动语态:
The inheritance pattern was determined to be gametic. = 遗传模式被确定为配子遗传。
The genetic material is passed gametically in this species. = 在这个物种中，遗传物质以配子方式传递。


疑问句:
Is this trait transmitted gametically or somatically? =  这种性状是通过遗传方式还是体细胞方式传递的？
Is the genetic information passed on gametically? = 遗传信息是通过遗传方式传递的吗？


否定句:
The disease is not transmitted gametically; it's environmentally induced. =  这种疾病不是通过遗传方式传播的；它是环境诱发的。
The phenotype was not expressed gametically. = 表型不是通过遗传方式表达的。


PHRASE->
gametic inheritance = 配子遗传
gametic selection = 配子选择
gametic mutation = 配子突变
gametic fusion = 配子融合
gametic incompatibility = 配子不相容性
