词源:

The word "far-reachingnesses" is formed from:

* **far:**  Old English *feorr*, meaning "distant, far off."
* **reaching:** Present participle of "reach," from Old English *rǣcan*, meaning "to stretch, extend."
* **-ness:**  A suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.  This suffix adds the meaning of "the state or quality of being."  The plural "-nesses" is added to reflect multiple instances of far-reaching effects.


Therefore, "far-reachingnesses" literally means "the multiple states or qualities of being far-reaching."
