laccolith:/ˈlækəˌlɪθ/| n. |岩床；潜岩丘|A laccolith is a sheet-like igneous intrusion that has been forcibly injected between parallel layers of sedimentary rock.  It causes the overlying strata to be arched upward, forming a dome-shaped structure. Unlike a sill, which is concordant with the bedding planes, a laccolith is often discordant, intruding and deforming the surrounding rocks.|Example: The geologist identified the dome-shaped hill as a laccolith, formed by the upward intrusion of magma.  地质学家将这座圆顶状的山丘确定为岩床，是由岩浆向上侵入形成的。|近义词：igneous intrusion, sill (when relatively flat)|反义词：None specifically, but the opposite would be a feature formed by erosion or deposition rather than intrusion.
