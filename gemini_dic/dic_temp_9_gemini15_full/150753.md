paracrystallinity: /ˌpærəˌkrɪstəˈlɪnəti/ | n. |准晶态，近晶态 | A state intermediate between a completely crystalline state and an amorphous state, characterized by a degree of order but lacking the long-range periodicity of a true crystal.  It often exhibits short-range order but lacks the long-range three-dimensional translational symmetry found in crystalline materials.  The structure is usually described as having regions of crystallinity interspersed with disordered regions. | Example: The polymer exhibited paracrystallinity, showing some degree of ordered structure but lacking the perfect periodicity of a true crystal.  = 这种聚合物呈现准晶态，显示出一定程度的有序结构，但缺乏真晶体的完美周期性。| 近义词：semicrystallinity, mesophase | 反义词：crystallinity, amorphicity


USAGE->

一般现在时:
