词源:
The word "physio-psychological" is a compound word formed by combining "physio-" (from Greek "physis," meaning "nature") and "-psychological" (from "psychology," ultimately from Greek "psyche," meaning "soul, mind" and "logos," meaning "study, discourse").  Therefore, it literally refers to the study or aspects related to both the physical nature and the mental aspects of a being.
