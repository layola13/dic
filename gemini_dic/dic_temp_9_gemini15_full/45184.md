The word "cuish" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, word class, meaning, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical examples as requested.  To provide such an analysis, I would need a valid English word.
