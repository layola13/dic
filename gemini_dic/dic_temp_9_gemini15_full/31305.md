词源:
The word "chaplet" comes from the Old French word "chapelet," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "capella," meaning "small hood" or "chapel."  The connection is through the image of a small hood-like shape of the flower garland or the beads clustered together.  The meaning evolved to include the devotional use of the string of beads.
