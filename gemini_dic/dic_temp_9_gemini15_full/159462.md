词源:
The word "police" ultimately derives from the ancient Greek word "politeia" (πολιτεία), meaning "citizenship" or "civil government."  Through Old French "police," referring to the regulation and government of a city or state,  it evolved to its modern meaning of a civil force responsible for maintaining order and enforcing laws.  The modern English usage solidified in the 18th century.
