enallage:/ɛˈnælɪdʒ/ | n. | 语法修辞格；词类转用 | The use of a word in a grammatical form different from its usual one, often for stylistic effect.  It involves a deliberate shift in grammatical category or number to achieve a specific literary effect. This can involve using a singular verb with a plural noun, a noun as a verb, or other such shifts.  | Example: "The ship sailed on, her sails full of wind."  (Here, "her" refers to the ship, a non-human entity;  this is a grammatical shift from the usual masculine pronoun usage.) | 近义词：figurative language, stylistic device, grammatical shift | 反义词：literal language, grammatically correct
