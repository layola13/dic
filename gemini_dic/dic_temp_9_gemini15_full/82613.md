The word "guate" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word, or a word from another language.  Could you double-check the spelling or provide more context?

2. **It's a slang term or neologism:**  It might be a very informal or newly coined word with limited usage.  If this is the case, providing the context where you encountered it would be helpful.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be an abbreviation or a proper noun (like a place name) specific to a particular region or community.
