词源:
The word "lithely" derives from the Old English word "līþ," meaning "yielding," "gentle," or "pliant."  This evolved into the Middle English "lithe," retaining the sense of flexibility and suppleness. The "-ly" suffix is an adverbial suffix, transforming the adjective "lithe" into the adverb "lithely."
