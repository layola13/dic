quasi-passive:/ˈkwɑːzaɪ ˈpæsɪv/| adj. |准被动语态，似被动语态|  A quasi-passive construction is a grammatical structure that resembles a passive voice construction but lacks some of its key characteristics, often involving a reflexive pronoun or a similar construction.  It may appear passive in form but is semantically active.  The subject is involved in the action but not directly performing it. |例句：The book sells well. (The book is not passively receiving the action of selling; it's actively involved in its own selling through its inherent qualities.)  The door closed itself. (The door is the subject, but the action is performed by the door itself, not by an external agent.)|近义词：pseudo-passive, seemingly passive|反义词：active voice
