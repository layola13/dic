USAGE->
此词为形容词，无动词、名词等其他词性变化，因此不适用各种时态及语态变化。  The word is an adjective and doesn't conjugate like a verb or decline like a noun.  It only describes a noun.


PHRASE->
由于chestiest本身并非常用词，因此难以列举其特定词组搭配。  Because "chestiest" is not a frequently used word, it's difficult to list common phrases using it.  The phrases would likely involve the word "chest" itself, rather than its superlative form.
