WORD ORIGIN->
The word "nonsculptural" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "sculptural," which derives from "sculpture."  "Sculpture" itself originates from the Latin word "sculptura," a noun meaning "a carving," "a sculptured work," or "the act of carving."  This, in turn, comes from the verb "sculpere," meaning "to carve," "to engrave," or "to sculpt."
