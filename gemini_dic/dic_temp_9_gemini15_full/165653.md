premodeling: /ˌpriːˈmɒdəlɪŋ/ | n. | 预建模；预模型；预先建模 | The process of creating a simplified or preliminary model before constructing a more complex or detailed one.  It's often used in various fields like software development, machine learning, and engineering to test assumptions, explore design options, and refine the final product.  Premodeling helps to identify potential problems early on and reduce the overall development time and cost. | Example:  The team conducted extensive premodeling to ensure the software's architecture would be scalable.  团队进行了广泛的预建模，以确保软件架构的可扩展性。|近义词：prototyping, preliminary modeling, initial modeling | 反义词：post-modeling, final modeling | 名词
