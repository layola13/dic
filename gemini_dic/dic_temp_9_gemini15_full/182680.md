reoxidizing:/ˌriːˈɒksɪdaɪzɪŋ/| v. |再氧化；重新氧化|The process of oxidizing something again after it has been reduced.  This often involves the addition of oxygen or the removal of electrons.  The term is commonly used in chemistry and materials science.|例句：The metal component is undergoing reoxidizing after being treated with a reducing agent. 金属部件在用还原剂处理后正在发生再氧化。

The catalyst is designed to prevent reoxidizing of the reduced product.  催化剂的设计是为了防止还原产物的再氧化。|近义词：re-oxidizing, oxidizing again|反义词：reducing
