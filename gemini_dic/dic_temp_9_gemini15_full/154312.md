peritricha:/ˌpɛrɪˈtraɪkə/| n. |周毛类纤毛虫 |A peritrich is a type of ciliate protozoan characterized by a ring of cilia around its oral area.  They are typically sessile (attached to a surface) and feed by creating a water current to draw in food particles. | Example:  Many species of peritricha are found in freshwater environments.  许多周毛类纤毛虫物种存在于淡水环境中。|近义词: ciliate (a broader term)|反义词: None specifically;  perhaps  "motile ciliate" (if contrasting with the sessile nature of many peritricha).


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Peritricha are found in diverse habitats. = 周毛虫存在于不同的栖息地。
This peritrich feeds on bacteria. = 这个周毛虫以细菌为食。


一般过去时:
Scientists observed the peritrich's feeding mechanism. = 科学家观察了周毛虫的摄食机制。
The researcher identified a new species of peritricha. = 研究人员鉴定了一种新的周毛虫物种。


现在完成时:

过去完成时:
Before the experiment, the peritrich had already reproduced. = 在实验之前，周毛虫已经繁殖了。

否定句:
This is not a typical peritricha. = 这不是典型的周毛虫。
The study did not include all species of peritricha. = 这项研究并没有包含所有种类的周毛虫。
