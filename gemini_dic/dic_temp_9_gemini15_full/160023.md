polysynthesis:/ˌpɒliˈsɪnθɪsɪs/| /ˌpɑːliˈsɪnθɪsɪs/| n. |多式合成 (语言学)|The process of combining multiple morphemes into a single word, resulting in highly complex words that express complex meanings.  This is a characteristic of some languages, particularly those in North America and Siberia.  Polysynthetic languages use many affixes to convey grammatical relations and semantic nuances.  | Example:  In some polysynthetic languages, a single word might encompass what would require an entire sentence in English.  For instance, a single word might express the subject, verb, object, and various adverbial modifiers. |近义词: agglutination (though agglutination is less extreme)|反义词: analytic language (languages with simpler word structures)|名词
