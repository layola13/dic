词源:

From Greek *deixis* "pointing, indication," from *deiknynai* "to show, point out."  The term was coined by linguists to describe words and phrases whose meaning is context-dependent.


用法说明:

Deictic expressions are common in everyday language and include:

* **Personal pronouns:** I, you, he, she, it, we, they.  Their meaning changes depending on who is speaking and who is being addressed.

* **Demonstratives:** this, that, these, those.  Their meaning depends on the spatial relationship between the speaker and the object being referred to.

* **Spatial adverbs:** here, there, everywhere.  Their meaning depends on the location of the speaker.

* **Temporal adverbs:** now, then, today, yesterday, tomorrow.  Their meaning depends on the time of utterance.

* **Verbs of motion:** come, go.  Their meaning depends on the perspective of the speaker.

The study of deixis is important for understanding how language is used in context and how meaning is constructed in conversation.  Misunderstandings can arise if deictic expressions are not interpreted correctly.
