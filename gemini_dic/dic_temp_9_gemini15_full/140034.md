oenocyan: /ˌoʊniˈoʊsɪən/ | n. |花青素|Oenocyan is a type of anthocyanin, a water-soluble pigment that gives many fruits and vegetables their red, purple, and blue colors.  It's particularly associated with grapes and red wine.  The name derives from the genus *Oenocarpus*, a type of palm, although the compound itself is not exclusively found in this genus.  Its chemical structure and precise properties vary depending on the source plant.|  Red grapes contain high levels of oenocyan, contributing to the color of red wine. |近义词:anthocyanin, flavonoid|反义词:None (no direct antonym, as it describes a pigment rather than a concept)|名词
