The word "self-exaggeration" is a compound word.  "Self" is a prefix indicating something done to or by oneself. "Exaggeration" comes from the Late Middle English word "exageryacion," which itself is derived from the Old French "exagération" and ultimately from the Latin "exagero," meaning "to carry beyond."  Therefore, self-exaggeration literally means "to carry oneself beyond" in terms of representation or description.
