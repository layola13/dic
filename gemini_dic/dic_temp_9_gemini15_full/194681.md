The word "self-vexation" is a compound word.

* **self-**:  A prefix meaning "of, by, or for oneself".  It's an Old English word.

* **vexation**: From Middle English *vexacioun*, from Old French *vexacioun*, from Latin *vexātiōnem*, from *vexāre* "to shake, disturb, harass," of uncertain origin.  This indicates the act of being annoyed, troubled, or irritated.

Therefore, "self-vexation" literally means "the act of vexing oneself."
