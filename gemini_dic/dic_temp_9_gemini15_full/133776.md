nongelling: /ˈnɒnˌdʒɛlɪŋ/ | adj. | 不凝固的；不胶凝的 | Not forming a gel; incapable of forming a gel.  This term usually refers to substances that would typically be expected to gel under certain conditions but fail to do so.  | Example:  The nongelling solution remained liquid even after cooling.  不凝胶溶液即使冷却后也仍然保持液态。|近义词：ungelled, fluid, liquid |反义词：gelling, solidified, gelatinous


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The solution is nongelling at room temperature. = 该溶液在室温下不会凝固。
This mixture remains nongelling despite the addition of the thickener. = 尽管添加了增稠剂，这种混合物仍然不会凝固。


一般过去时:
The experiment showed the solution was nongelling. = 实验表明该溶液不会凝固。
The mixture remained nongelling even after prolonged heating. = 即使长时间加热，混合物仍然不会凝固。


现在完成时:
The scientists have found a way to make a nongelling substance. = 科学家们已经找到了一种制造不凝胶物质的方法。
The company has reported that their new product is nongelling. = 公司报告说他们的新产品不会凝固。


过去完成时:
Before the addition of the catalyst, the mixture had remained nongelling. = 在添加催化剂之前，混合物一直没有凝固。
They had discovered that the high temperature prevented the substance from becoming nongelling. = 他们发现高温阻止了物质凝固。


将来时:
The new formula will be nongelling at low temperatures. = 新配方在低温下不会凝固。
We predict that this improved formulation will remain nongelling for an extended period. = 我们预测这种改进后的配方将在较长时间内保持不凝固状态。


虚拟语气:
If we used a different solvent, the product might be nongelling. = 如果我们使用不同的溶剂，产品可能不会凝固。
I wish the mixture would remain nongelling at higher temperatures. = 我希望混合物在较高温度下也能保持不凝固状态。


被动语态:
The substance was determined to be nongelling by the researchers. = 研究人员确定该物质不会凝固。
A nongelling product is being developed for use in the food industry. = 正在开发一种不凝胶产品用于食品工业。


疑问句:
Is this compound nongelling under normal conditions? = 在正常条件下，这种化合物会凝固吗？
Why is the mixture nongelling despite the presence of the gelator? = 尽管存在胶凝剂，为什么混合物不会凝固？


否定句:
The mixture is not nongelling; it forms a gel at low temperatures. = 混合物不会凝固；它在低温下会形成凝胶。
The results showed that the solution was not nongelling, as expected. = 结果表明，正如预期的那样，溶液会凝固。



PHRASE->
nongelling substance = 不凝固物质
nongelling solution = 不凝胶溶液
nongelling properties = 不凝胶特性
nongelling behavior = 不凝胶行为
nongelling agent =  (less common, implies something that prevents gelling) 不凝胶剂
