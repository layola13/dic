词源:
The word "guys" evolved from "guy," which originally meant a "man," "fellow," or "person."  The etymology of "guy" is uncertain, but it might ultimately derive from the name Guy Fawkes, whose name became associated with effigies and hence with any man or person generally.  The plural form "guys" emerged as a colloquialism and has broadened its usage to include both men and women.
