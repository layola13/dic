nuclear-forces:/ˈnjuːkliər fɔːrsɪz/| n.|核力，核作用力|The strong and weak nuclear forces are fundamental forces of nature that govern interactions between subatomic particles within the nucleus of an atom.  Nuclear forces are responsible for binding protons and neutrons together in the atomic nucleus, overcoming the electrostatic repulsion between positively charged protons.|例句：The strong nuclear force is responsible for holding the nucleus of an atom together.  强核力负责将原子核结合在一起。

The weak nuclear force is involved in radioactive decay. 弱核力参与放射性衰变。|近义词：nuclear interaction, atomic forces|反义词：electromagnetic forces (in terms of their effects within the nucleus)
