The word "nonsuctions" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word not yet widely recognized.  Therefore, I cannot provide a complete analysis following your requested format.  To help, I need clarification:

* **Is this a misspelling?** If so, please provide the intended word.
* **Is this a technical term or jargon?** If so, please provide the context where you encountered it.
* **Is this a newly coined word?** If so, please provide the intended meaning and context.


Without this information, a detailed analysis is impossible.
