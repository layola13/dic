nonrepellers: /ˌnɒnɹɪˈpɛləz/ | n. |非排斥子|  Points in a dynamical system that do not repel nearby trajectories.  They are the opposite of repellers.  The behavior of trajectories near a nonrepeller can vary; they might be attracted to it (attractor), cycle around it (periodic orbit), or exhibit more complex behavior.  The precise definition depends on the context (e.g., continuous vs. discrete dynamical systems). | Example:  In this chaotic system, the strange attractor is surrounded by a region of nonrepellers. = 在这个混沌系统中，奇异吸引子周围环绕着一块非排斥子区域。
