词源:
The term "chef-d'oeuvre" is a French phrase.  It literally translates to "chief work" or "master work".

"chef" comes from the Old French word "chief," meaning "head" or "chief".

"d'oeuvre" is a contraction of "de oeuvre," where "de" is a preposition meaning "of" and "oeuvre" means "work".  "Oeuvre" itself comes from the Latin word "opera," meaning "works".
