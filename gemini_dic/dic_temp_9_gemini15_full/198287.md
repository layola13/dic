词源:

The word "should" originates from the Old English word "sculan," meaning "to owe," "to be obliged," or "to be destined."  It evolved through Middle English "schulen" and eventually to its modern form.  The modal verb nature developed over time, losing its original sense of obligation in certain contexts and gaining the more nuanced meanings it has today.
