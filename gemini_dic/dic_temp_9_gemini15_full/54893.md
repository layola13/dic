词源:
The word "disponer" comes from the Old French word "disposer," which in turn derives from the Latin word "disponere." "Disponere" is a compound of "dis-" (meaning "apart" or "away") and "ponere" (meaning "to place" or "to put"). Therefore, the original meaning points towards "to put away" or "to arrange."  The evolution of meaning reflects the various ways in which we "put away" things – physically, as in disposing of waste, or figuratively, as in disposing of a problem.
