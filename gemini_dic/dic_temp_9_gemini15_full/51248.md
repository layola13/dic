It's used to release resources held by the object, such as memory, files, or network connections, preventing memory leaks and other problems. | Example: In C++, the destructor for a class is typically named with a tilde (~) before the class name (e.g., ~MyClass()). When a MyClass object goes out of scope, its destructor is automatically invoked.  |近义词：deconstructor (less common)|反义词：constructor|
