The word "parriers" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Perhaps "barriers," "parries," or another word entirely?  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name (of a person, place, or thing) or a brand name.  If this is the case, more context is needed to understand its meaning.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.  Again, providing more context would be helpful.
