overmeeknesses: /ˌoʊvərˈmiːknɪsəz/ | n. | 过分温顺；过度谦逊 |  The word "overmeeknesses" is not a standard English word. It's a nonce word, meaning it's created for a specific occasion and not found in dictionaries. It's formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessive") to the noun "meeknesses," which itself is the plural of "meekness" (the quality of being meek or humble).  Therefore, it implies an excessive or exaggerated display of meekness or humility.  The word suggests a level of meekness that might be considered unnatural, insincere, or even manipulative.
