overmodulation:/ˌoʊvərˌmɑːdʒʊˈleɪʃən/ | n. |过调制，过调幅|The process of modulating a signal beyond its optimal level, resulting in distortion and loss of information.  This often happens when the amplitude of a modulating signal exceeds the capacity of the carrier signal.  It leads to a clipping of the peaks of the waveform, introducing harmonic distortion and potentially interfering with other signals.| Example: Overmodulation of the radio signal caused significant distortion and reduced the clarity of the broadcast.  过调制无线电信号导致严重的失真，并降低了广播的清晰度。|近义词：overdriving, saturation |反义词：undermodulation
