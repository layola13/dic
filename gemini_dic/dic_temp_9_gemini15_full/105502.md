kilobyte:/ˈkɪləbaɪt/| n. |千字节，KB|A kilobyte (KB) is a unit of digital information or computer storage equal to 1024 bytes.  It's often used as a measure of the size of files, programs, or other digital data.  Note that while technically a kilobyte is 1024 bytes (2<sup>10</sup> bytes), it is sometimes approximated as 1000 bytes in certain contexts.|例句：The document is about 10 kilobytes in size. 这份文件大小约为10千字节。

The image file is too large; it's over 20 kilobytes. 图片文件太大，超过20千字节了。|近义词：megabyte, gigabyte|反义词：bit (although not a direct opposite, bit is a much smaller unit)|词性:名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
This file contains 5 kilobytes of data. = 这个文件包含5千字节的数据。
How many kilobytes does this program require? = 这个程序需要多少千字节？


一般过去时:
The old system only supported files up to 10 kilobytes. = 旧系统只支持最多10千字节的文件。
Yesterday, I downloaded a file that was 25 kilobytes. = 昨天我下载了一个25千字节的文件。


现在完成时:
We have already transferred over 100 kilobytes of data. = 我们已经传输了超过100千字节的数据。
She has saved several files, totaling over 50 kilobytes. = 她保存了几个文件，总共超过50千字节。


过去完成时:
Before the upgrade, the system had only handled files under 5 kilobytes. = 在升级之前，系统只能处理小于5千字节的文件。
They had already processed millions of kilobytes of data by the end of the day. = 到那天结束时，他们已经处理了数百万千字节的数据。


将来时:
This program will likely require more than 100 kilobytes of memory. = 这个程序可能需要超过100千字节的内存。
We will download several files totaling several gigabytes, starting with smaller ones of just a few kilobytes.  = 我们将下载几个总共几千兆字节的文件，从只有几千字节的小文件开始。


虚拟语气:
If the file were only 1 kilobyte, it would transfer instantly. = 如果文件只有1千字节，它会立即传输。
I wish I had known the file was so large; it's over 100 kilobytes. = 我真希望我知道文件这么大；它超过100千字节。


被动语态:
The data was compressed to reduce its size to under 5 kilobytes. = 数据被压缩以将其大小减小到小于5千字节。
Several kilobytes of data are being transferred currently. = 目前正在传输几千字节的数据。


疑问句:
How many kilobytes of storage are left on the hard drive? = 硬盘上还剩下多少千字节的存储空间？
What is the size of this file in kilobytes? = 这个文件的大小是多少千字节？


否定句:
This file doesn't contain more than 1 kilobyte of data. = 这个文件不包含超过1千字节的数据。
The program didn't require more than 10 kilobytes of memory. = 该程序不需要超过10千字节的内存。


PHRASE->
kilobyte size = 千字节大小
kilobyte per second = 千字节每秒
kilobyte data = 千字节数据
kilobyte transfer = 千字节传输
kilobyte capacity = 千字节容量
