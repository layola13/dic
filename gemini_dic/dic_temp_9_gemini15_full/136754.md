英文解析：The word "nonsententiousnesses" is the plural form of "nonsententiousness," which means a lack of sententiousness.  Sententiousness refers to the quality of being moralizing, or given to excessive moralizing in a pompous or affected manner. Therefore, nonsententiousness implies a lack of such moralizing or a style of communication that avoids preachiness or excessive pronouncements of moral lessons.  It suggests a straightforward, unpretentious, and perhaps even informal approach.


例句：

The novel's charm lies in its nonsententiousnesses; it doesn't preach but simply tells a compelling story. = 这部小说的魅力在于它缺乏说教；它没有说教，而是简单地讲述了一个引人入胜的故事。

His speeches were notable for their nonsententiousnesses, a welcome change from the usual political rhetoric. = 他的演讲以其缺乏说教而著称，这与通常的政治言辞相比是一个可喜的变化。


词源：

* **sententious:**  From Latin *sententiosus*, meaning "full of meaning, pithy, significant."  This, in turn, derives from *sententia*, meaning "opinion, judgment, maxim."

* **-ness:**  A common English suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.

* **non-:**  A prefix meaning "not."


Therefore, "nonsententiousnesses" traces its roots back to the Latin concept of a "meaningful saying" or "maxim," but negates that quality, describing something devoid of moralizing or preachiness.
