词源:
The word "overcast" comes from the Old English "ofercaest," which literally means "overthrown" or "cast over."  The "over" prefix indicates something above or covering something else, while "cast" refers to the throwing or scattering of clouds across the sky.  The modern sense evolved from the literal meaning to describe a sky covered by clouds.
