词源:
The word "dithery" is derived from the verb "dither," which originally meant to tremble or shake.  The -y suffix transforms the verb into an adjective, describing a state of being characterized by trembling or nervousness.  The ultimate origins are uncertain, but it's likely related to Old English words suggesting trembling or shaking.
