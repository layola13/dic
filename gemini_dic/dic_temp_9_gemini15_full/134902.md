nonmultiplications: /ˌnɒnˌmʌltɪplɪˈkeɪʃənz/ | n. |非乘法运算|The term "nonmultiplications" refers to any mathematical operation or process that does not involve multiplication.  This is a broad term encompassing a wide range of operations, including addition, subtraction, division, exponentiation, and more complex operations found in advanced mathematics.  It’s not a commonly used word, and its meaning is largely derived from its contrasting relationship to multiplication. |The calculation involved several nonmultiplications, primarily additions and subtractions. = 该计算涉及多个非乘法运算，主要是加法和减法。 This algorithm avoids nonmultiplications by using a clever bit-shifting technique. = 该算法通过巧妙的位移技术避免了非乘法运算。 |近义词: non-multiplicative operations, additive operations (if specifically referring to addition), subtractive operations (if specifically referring to subtraction), etc. |反义词: multiplications |名词


USAGE->  (Since "nonmultiplications" is a noun, verb conjugations are not applicable.  The usage examples will focus on how the word is used in sentences)


Example 1:  The simplified algorithm reduced the number of nonmultiplications required for the computation. = 简化后的算法减少了计算所需的非乘法运算次数。

PHRASE->

There are no common phrases directly involving "nonmultiplications" as it's a highly specialized term.  Phrases would be contextual and depend on the specific mathematical operation being contrasted with multiplication.  For example:


1. "A focus on additive nonmultiplications" (emphasizing addition as the non-multiplicative operation)
2. "Minimizing nonmultiplicative operations" (a more general phrase)
3. "Algorithms with reduced nonmultiplications" (referring to computational efficiency)
4. "The use of non-multiplicative techniques"
5. "Analysis of nonmultiplicative components"
