pycnidium:/paɪkˈnɪdiəm/| n. |分生孢子器|A pycnidium (plural pycnidia) is a type of asexual fruiting body found in many fungi, particularly in the coelomycetes.  It is a globose or flask-shaped structure with a single opening (ostiole) through which conidia (asexual spores) are released.  Pycnidia are typically dark-colored and can be immersed in the host tissue or superficial. |The fungus produced numerous pycnidia on the infected leaves.|近义词：acervulus (but acervuli are generally flatter and lack a distinct ostiole)|反义词：None (no direct antonym)|名词


USAGE->

将来时:
Researchers will examine the pycnidia under a microscope. = 研究人员将在显微镜下检查分生孢子器。
We will analyze the pycnidia to determine the fungal species. = 我们将分析分生孢子器以确定真菌种类。


虚拟语气:
If the pycnidia were larger, they would be easier to see. = 如果分生孢子器更大，它们就更容易被看到。

The pycnidia are being studied for their role in disease transmission. = 正在研究分生孢子器在疾病传播中的作用。


疑问句:
What type of pycnidia are these? = 这些是什么类型的分生孢子器？
Where are the pycnidia located on the plant? = 分生孢子器位于植物的哪个部位？


否定句:
The sample did not contain any pycnidia. = 样本中不包含任何分生孢子器。
The leaves showed no signs of pycnidia development. = 叶子没有显示分生孢子器发育的迹象。
