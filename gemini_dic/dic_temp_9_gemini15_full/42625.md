词源:

The word "counterrevolution" is a compound word formed from "counter" (meaning "against" or "opposite") and "revolution."  The word "revolution" itself comes from the Latin word "revolutio," meaning "a turning around" or "a complete change." Thus, "counterrevolution" literally means "a turning against a turning," or "a movement against a revolution."
