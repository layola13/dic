词源：The word "scruffy" likely originates from a combination of the Old English word "scrūf" (meaning "scrub" or "brush") and the suffix "-y," which forms adjectives indicating a state or quality.  The exact etymological path is unclear, but the connection to rough, scrubby textures is evident in its current meaning.  It evolved over time to describe not just a rough texture but also a general state of disarray and untidiness.
