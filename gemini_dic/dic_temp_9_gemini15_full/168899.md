词源:
professionalise is derived from "professional" + "-ise" (a suffix indicating "to make" or "to become").  "Professional" itself originates from the Middle English word "professione," ultimately derived from the Late Latin "professio," meaning "declaration," "open avowal," or "public profession of faith."  The shift to its modern meaning of a skilled occupation happened gradually.
