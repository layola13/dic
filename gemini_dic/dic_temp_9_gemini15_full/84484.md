The word "haltest" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it, no established meaning, and no etymology. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a very niche context (like jargon or slang).  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.
