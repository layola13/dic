词源:

The word "disencumbrance" is derived from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "removal of" or "opposite of"), and the noun "encumbrance."  "Encumbrance" itself comes from the Old French word "encombrer," meaning "to hinder" or "to obstruct," which ultimately traces back to the Germanic root *kumb-, meaning "to bend" or "to curve."  Thus, "disencumbrance" literally means the removal of that which hinders or bends.
