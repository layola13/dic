silenus:/saɪˈlaɪnəs/| n. |西勒努斯| Silenus is, in Greek mythology, a satyr, companion of Dionysus, often depicted as an old, fat, drunken man riding a donkey or mule, sometimes accompanied by a wine-skin. He is known for his wisdom and prophetic abilities, often portrayed as being jovial and mischievous, but also capable of profound insight. He is sometimes presented as the foster father or tutor of Dionysus. | Example: The painting depicted Silenus, his belly bulging, riding a drunken donkey. 这幅画描绘了西勒努斯，他大腹便便，骑着一头醉醺醺的驴子。| 近义词: satyr, faun | 反义词:  (无直接反义词，可考虑与雅典娜等庄重神祇对比)
