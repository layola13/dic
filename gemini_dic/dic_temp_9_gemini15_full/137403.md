词源:

The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "tenurial," which is derived from "tenure."  "Tenure" ultimately comes from the Old French word "tenure," meaning "holding," "possession," or "occupation," which in turn originates from the Latin word "tenēre," meaning "to hold."  Therefore, "nontenurial" literally means "not holding tenure."
