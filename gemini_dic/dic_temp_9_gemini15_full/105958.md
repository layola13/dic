词源:  The word "kludge" itself is of uncertain origin.  One theory suggests it's an alteration of "kluge," a German word meaning "clever," but this connection is tenuous.  Its usage as a technical term emerged in the late 20th century, possibly from the programming community, reflecting the often-improvised nature of software development.  The -ing suffix forms the noun denoting the act of kludging.
