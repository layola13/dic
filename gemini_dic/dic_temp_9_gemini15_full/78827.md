Etymology:

The word "gimmickery" is derived from "gimmick" + "-ery".  "Gimmick" itself originates from the early 20th century, with its etymology uncertain.  One suggested origin is from a possibly dialectal or slang use, referring to a mechanical device or gadget, and gradually evolving to mean a trick or device used to attract attention.  The suffix "-ery" forms nouns denoting a collection, practice, or state of something.  Therefore, "gimmickeries" signifies a collection or abundance of tricks or deceptive practices.
