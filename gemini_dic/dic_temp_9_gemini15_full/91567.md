hyperaccuracies:/ˌhaɪpərˈækjʊrəsiːz/| n.|超高精度；过度精确|Extremely high accuracy, often to the point of being excessive or unnecessary.  It implies a level of precision that might be impractical or even counterproductive. |Example: The hyperaccuracies in the model's predictions led to overfitting and poor generalization to new data.  模型预测的超高精度导致过拟合，难以推广到新的数据。|近义词：high precision, extreme accuracy, overprecision |反义词：inaccuracy, imprecision, approximation
