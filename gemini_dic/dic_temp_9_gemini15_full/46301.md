d-structure:/ˈdiː ˌstrʌktʃər/| n. |深层结构|In linguistics, a d-structure (deep structure) is the underlying syntactic structure of a sentence, representing its grammatical relations and logical meaning, as opposed to its surface structure (s-structure).  It's a theoretical construct in generative grammar, representing the underlying representation of a sentence before transformations occur.  It reflects the semantic relationships between words and phrases, which may not be directly apparent in the surface form of the sentence. For example, a passive sentence's d-structure will reveal the underlying agent-patient relationship even though the surface structure obscures this. | The d-structure of "The ball was thrown by John" shows that John is the agent and the ball is the patient, even though John appears at the end of the sentence in the surface structure.  |近义词：deep structure, underlying structure|反义词：s-structure, surface structure|名词
