The word "proabsolutisms" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism, possibly a deliberate coinage or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  However, we can speculate on its potential meaning and etymology based on its components:


* **pro-** (prefix):  in favor of; supporting; in support of.
* **absolutism** (noun): /ˈæbsəˌluːtɪzəm/ | n. | 专制主义；绝对主义 | The principle of absolute power, especially in government.  A political system in which a single ruler or group holds absolute power without constitutional limitations.


Based on this, "proabsolutisms" might be intended to mean something like "arguments in favor of absolutism" or "advocacies for absolutist systems".  However, without a context or source where this word was used, its precise meaning remains uncertain.  It's likely a non-standard, rarely used, or incorrectly formed word.


To provide a response that adheres to your format, I will instead analyze the word "absolutism" itself, as it's the core component of the purported neologism:


absolutism: /ˈæbsəˌluːtɪzəm/ | n. | 专制主义；绝对主义 | The principle of absolute power, especially in government. A political system in which a single ruler or group holds absolute power without constitutional limitations.  It often involves the suppression of dissent and the concentration of power in the hands of a few.
