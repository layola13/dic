The word "reule" is not a recognized word in standard English.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* **It's a proper noun:**  If it's a name or place, more context is needed.
* **It's from a different language:**  If it's from another language, please specify the language so I can attempt a translation and explanation.
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word or slang term not yet widely recognized.

Please provide more information or correct the spelling so I can assist you.
