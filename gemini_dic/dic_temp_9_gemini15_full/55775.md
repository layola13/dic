词源:

diversionary comes from the verb "divert," meaning "to turn aside" or "to distract."  The suffix "-ary" forms an adjective, meaning "relating to" or "characterized by."  Therefore, "diversionary" means "relating to or characterized by diversion."  The root of "divert" can be traced back to the Latin word "divertere,"  a compound of "dis-" (away) and "vertere" (to turn).
