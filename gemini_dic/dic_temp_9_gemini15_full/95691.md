incondensability: /ˌɪnkɒndɛnsəˈbɪləti/ | n. |不可凝结性；不凝结性 | The inability of a substance to condense into a liquid or solid state under given conditions.  This property is often discussed in relation to gases, particularly at high temperatures or low pressures.  | Example: The incondensability of helium at room temperature makes it useful in cryogenics.  氦气在室温下的不可凝结性使其在低温学中得到应用。 | 近义词: noncondensability, volatility (in a relevant context) | 反义词: condensability


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in scientific and technical contexts, particularly in fields like physics, chemistry, and engineering.  Therefore, grammatical examples focusing on tense are less relevant than demonstrating its usage in specific scenarios.

Example 1 (Scientific explanation):
"The high incondensability of the gas mixture prevented efficient liquefaction, even under extreme pressure."  气体混合物的高不可凝结性即使在极端压力下也阻止了有效的液化。


Example 2 (Engineering application):
"Engineers must account for the incondensability of certain components when designing cryogenic systems." 工程师在设计低温系统时必须考虑某些组分的不可凝结性。


Example 3 (Comparative analysis):
"Comparing the incondensability of hydrogen and oxygen reveals significant differences in their behaviour at low temperatures."  比较氢气和氧气的不可凝结性揭示了它们在低温下的行为存在显著差异。


PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases directly using "incondensability."  Its usage is primarily within technical descriptions and scientific reports.  Related phrases might include:

high degree of incondensability 高度不可凝结性
low incondensability 低不可凝结性
measure incondensability 测量不可凝结性
incondensable gas 不可凝结气体
effect of incondensability 不可凝结性的影响
