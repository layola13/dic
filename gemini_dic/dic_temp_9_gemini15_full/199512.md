词源:  The word "sinewy" originates from the Old English word "sinu," meaning "sinew" or "tendon."  The suffix "-y" denotes a characteristic or quality. Therefore, "sinewy" literally means "having many sinews" or "possessing the qualities of sinews."  The connection to strength and leanness comes from the visual association of prominent tendons with muscular individuals.
