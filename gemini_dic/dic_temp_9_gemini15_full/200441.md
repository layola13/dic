slagability: /ˌslæɡəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可熔性；可造渣性 | The ability of a substance to form a slag.  This term is primarily used in metallurgy and materials science, referring to the ease with which a material can be converted into a slag during a smelting process.  Slag is a by-product of smelting, a glassy byproduct consisting of impurities that separate from the desired metal.  A high slagability indicates that the material readily forms slag, making it easier to separate impurities from the metal. | 例句：The high slagability of this ore makes it ideal for efficient smelting.  这种矿石的高熔渣性使其成为高效冶炼的理想选择。

The slagability of the iron was tested before the smelting process began. 冶炼过程开始前对铁的熔渣性进行了测试。


近义词：fusibility (in the context of forming a slag)


反义词： There isn't a direct antonym, but a low slagability would imply difficulty in slag formation.  低熔渣性意味着难以形成熔渣。
