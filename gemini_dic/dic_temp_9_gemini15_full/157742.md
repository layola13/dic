词源:
From Latin *placāre "to please, appease, soothe," related to placere "to please," and ultimately to the PIE root *plak- "to be flat, smooth, even."  The sense development is from the idea of making something smooth or even (like a troubled situation) to the idea of making someone calm or satisfied.
