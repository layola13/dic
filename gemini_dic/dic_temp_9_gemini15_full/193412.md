seismologists:/ˌsaɪzˈmɒlədʒɪsts/| n. |地震学家|Scientists who study earthquakes and seismic waves. They analyze seismic data to understand the Earth's internal structure, predict earthquakes, and assess seismic hazards.|Seismologists are currently studying the aftershocks of the recent earthquake.|geophysicists, geologists| (no direct antonym, but perhaps "astrophysicists" if considering contrasting fields of study)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Seismologists study earthquakes. = 地震学家研究地震。
Seismologists analyze seismic data. = 地震学家分析地震数据。

一般过去时:
Seismologists studied the earthquake's impact. = 地震学家研究了地震的影响。
