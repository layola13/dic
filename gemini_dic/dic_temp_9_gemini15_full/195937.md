sensitizer:/ˈsɛnsɪtaɪzər/| n. |敏化剂，增感剂|A sensitizer is a substance that increases the sensitivity of a system to a stimulus, often by making it more reactive to light or other forms of energy.  This is often used in photography, medicine, and other fields.|Example:  Ultraviolet light is a sensitizer for many chemical reactions. 紫外光是许多化学反应的敏化剂。 The dye acts as a photosensitizer in the process.  该染料在此过程中充当光敏剂。|近义词： photosensitizer, activator |反义词：inhibitor, desensitizer |名词
