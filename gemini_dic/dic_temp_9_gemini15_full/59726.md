ecliptic:/ɪˈklɪptɪk/| n. |黄道|The ecliptic is the apparent path of the sun across the sky throughout the year.  It's the projection of Earth's orbital plane onto the celestial sphere. The planets also appear to move along or near the ecliptic.|例句：The planets are all found within a narrow band around the ecliptic. 行星都位于黄道附近的一条狭窄带内。

The moon's orbit is inclined at a small angle to the ecliptic. 月球轨道与黄道有一个小的倾角。|近义词：celestial equator (in contrast)|反义词：None.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The ecliptic defines the plane of Earth's orbit. = 黄道定义了地球轨道的平面。
The planets generally follow the ecliptic. = 行星通常沿着黄道运行。


一般过去时:
Ancient astronomers carefully mapped the ecliptic. = 古代天文学家仔细绘制了黄道的星图。
They used the ecliptic to predict celestial events. = 他们利用黄道来预测天象。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the ecliptic for centuries. = 科学家们已经研究黄道几个世纪了。
Astronomers have observed many celestial bodies near the ecliptic. = 天文学家们已经观测到许多位于黄道附近的星体。


过去完成时:
Before the invention of the telescope, the ecliptic was charted using naked-eye observations. = 在望远镜发明之前，黄道的绘制是通过肉眼观测完成的。
They had already determined the ecliptic's position before starting their calculations. = 在开始计算之前，他们已经确定了黄道的位置。


将来时:
Future missions will continue to study the ecliptic. = 未来的任务将继续研究黄道。
We will use precise instruments to map the ecliptic more accurately. = 我们将使用精确的仪器来更精确地绘制黄道。


虚拟语气:
If the Earth's axis were not tilted, there would be no seasons and the ecliptic would coincide with the celestial equator. = 如果地球的轴线没有倾斜，就不会有四季，黄道将与天赤道重合。
I wish I understood the complexities of the ecliptic's influence on the planets. = 我希望我能理解黄道对行星影响的复杂性。


被动语态:
The ecliptic is defined by the Earth's orbit around the sun. = 黄道是由地球绕太阳运行的轨道定义的。
The positions of stars are often referenced to the ecliptic. = 星星的位置通常以黄道为参考。


疑问句:
What is the significance of the ecliptic in astronomy? = 黄道在天文学中有什么意义？
Where does the ecliptic intersect the celestial equator? = 黄道与天赤道在哪里相交？


否定句:
The comets do not always follow the ecliptic. = 彗星并不总是沿着黄道运行。
The apparent path of the stars is not the same as the ecliptic. = 星星的视运动路径与黄道并不相同。


PHRASE->
plane of the ecliptic = 黄道面
obliquity of the ecliptic = 黄赤交角
zodiac and ecliptic = 黄道十二宫和黄道
celestial longitude and ecliptic = 黄经和黄道
ecliptic coordinates = 黄道坐标


词源:
From Late Latin *ecliptica, from Greek Ἐκλειπτική (Ekliptikḗ), from ἐκλείπειν (ekleípein) "to fail, to disappear," referring to the eclipses of the sun and moon which occur when the sun, moon, and Earth are aligned along the ecliptic.
