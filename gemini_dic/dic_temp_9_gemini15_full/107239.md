USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective and does not take verb conjugations in the same way as "to be" or "to do".  Therefore, traditional verb tense examples are inapplicable.  The usage focuses on describing a noun.

Example 1:  The laired lion watched its prey from the shadows.  = 栖息的狮子从阴影中注视着它的猎物。
Example 2:  A laired badger is surprisingly difficult to find. = 躲在巢穴里的獾很难找到。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "laired" as it is not a frequently used word.  Phrases would need to be constructed around it to describe a specific situation.  For example:  "a laired animal", "deeply laired", "securely laired", "newly laired".
