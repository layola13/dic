词源:
The word "deprecated" comes from the verb "deprecate," which means to express disapproval of.  It's ultimately derived from Latin "deprecāri," meaning "to pray against," "to avert by prayer," or "to beg off."  The sense of expressing disapproval evolved from the idea of praying against something undesirable.
