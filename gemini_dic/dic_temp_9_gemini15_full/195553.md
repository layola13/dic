词源:  The word "semipious" is a combination of the prefix "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partially") and the adjective "pious" (meaning "having or showing deep religious devotion").  Therefore, it literally means "half-pious" or "partially pious."  The word's etymology traces back to the Latin word "pius," meaning "dutiful," "pious," or "religious."  The prefix "semi-" has roots in Latin as well.
