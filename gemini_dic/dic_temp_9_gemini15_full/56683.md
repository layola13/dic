词源:
The word "doohickey" is of uncertain origin, but it is likely a blend of words that all share the meaning of an unknown or unnamed object. It's considered a colloquialism, meaning it's more common in informal speech and writing.  Its evolution reflects the need for a word to describe the ubiquitous everyday object whose name has escaped us.
