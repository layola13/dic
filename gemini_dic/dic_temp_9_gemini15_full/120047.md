millivolts:/ˈmɪlivoʊlts/| n. |毫伏|A millivolt (mV) is a unit of electric potential difference or electromotive force equal to one thousandth of a volt (1 mV = 0.001 V). It's a commonly used unit for measuring small voltages in electronic circuits and other applications.  |The sensor output was measured in millivolts. 传感器输出以毫伏为单位测量。 The battery produced only a few millivolts. 电池只产生几毫伏。|volt, microvolt|volt|
