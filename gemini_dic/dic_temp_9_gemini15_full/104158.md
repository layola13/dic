The word "jungli" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word? Please double-check the spelling.
2. **A word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language, possibly a dialect or slang term.  If you can provide the language of origin, I can try to help.
3. **A neologism:** It could be a newly coined word not yet widely used.  More context is needed.
