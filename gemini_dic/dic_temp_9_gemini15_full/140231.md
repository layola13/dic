词源:

From Middle English *officious, from Old French *officieux, from Latin *officiosus, from officium ("duty, service").  The modern meaning developed from the original sense of "performing one's duties," but with a negative connotation added over time to describe someone who performs their duties in an excessively eager or intrusive way.
