combinator:/ˌkɒmbɪˈneɪtə(r)/| /ˌkɑːmbɪˈneɪtər/| n. |组合器；组合函数|A combinator is a higher-order function that uses only function application and earlier defined combinators to define a result from its arguments.  It's a fundamental concept in functional programming and lambda calculus, where it serves as a building block for constructing more complex functions without relying on variables. |Example:  In lambda calculus, the S combinator is defined as Sxyz = xz(yz). This means the S combinator takes three functions (x, y, z) as arguments and applies them in a specific way to produce a result.|近义词：functional, operator|反义词：None


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the context of computer science and mathematics.  Therefore, standard grammatical tenses and forms are not applicable in the same way as with common verbs or nouns.  The usage revolves around its definition and application within functional programming paradigms.

Example 1 (Definition):
The combinator S is a powerful tool for building complex functions. = 组合器S是构建复杂函数的强大工具。

Example 2 (Application):
We can use combinators to express algorithms without relying on mutable state. = 我们可以使用组合器来表达算法，而无需依赖可变状态。


PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases directly using "combinator" in everyday language.  Its usage is highly specialized.  However, phrases related to its application in computer science might include:

Phrase 1:  Combinator logic = 组合逻辑
Phrase 2:  Combinator calculus = 组合演算
Phrase 3:  SKI combinator system = SKI组合子系统
