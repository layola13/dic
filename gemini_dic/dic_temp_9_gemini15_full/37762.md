词源:
The word "compassionate" comes from the Late Middle English word "compassionat," derived from the Old French "compassioné," meaning "to suffer with."  This in turn comes from the Latin "compassionem," which is a noun form of "compassionari," meaning "to suffer with," composed of "com-" (together) and "pati" (to suffer).
