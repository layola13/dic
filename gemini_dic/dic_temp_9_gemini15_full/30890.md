词源:  Derived from the word "chaff," meaning to tease or joke in a good-natured way, but in the adverbial form "-ingly," it implies a more irritating and less playful tone.  The suffix "-ingly" transforms the adjective or noun into an adverb, modifying the verb and describing the manner of the action.
