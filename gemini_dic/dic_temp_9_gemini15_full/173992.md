quasi-supervised:/ˈkwɑːziˌsuːpərvaɪzd/| adj.| 准监督的，半监督的 |  Relating to or denoting machine learning techniques that use a combination of labeled and unlabeled data to train a model.  It leverages a small amount of labeled data to guide the learning process from a larger pool of unlabeled data. This approach aims to reduce the need for extensive manual labeling while still achieving good performance. | Example: Quasi-supervised learning is a promising approach for handling large datasets with limited labeled examples.  准监督学习是一种很有前景的方法，可以处理标记示例有限的大型数据集。|近义词：semi-supervised|反义词：supervised, unsupervised
