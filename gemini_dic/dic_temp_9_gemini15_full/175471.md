词源:

The word "rampageously" is derived from the noun "rampage" and the suffix "-ously".

* **Rampage:** This word originates from the now-obsolete verb "rampage," meaning "to rage" or "to storm about wildly."  Its ultimate etymology is uncertain, but some theories connect it to the Old French word "rampager," which likely had a similar meaning.

* **-ously:** This suffix is a common adverbial suffix in English, derived from the Latin suffix "-ose," meaning "full of" or "characterized by."
