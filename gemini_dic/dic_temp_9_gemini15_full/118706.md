metacone:/ˈmɛtəkəʊn/| n. | 后锥体 | A metacone is a cusp (a pointed projection) on the posterior (back) surface of a tooth, specifically on the upper premolars and molars of some mammals.  It's one of the four main cusps typically found on these teeth (the others being the protocone, paracone, and hypocone).|  The metacone is a key feature in the study of mammalian dentition and can be used to identify and classify different species. | 近义词：posterior cusp | 反义词：无


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The metacone is located on the posterior surface of the tooth. = 后锥体位于牙齿的后表面。
This species exhibits a well-developed metacone. = 这个物种显示出发育良好的后锥体。


一般过去时:
Researchers studied the metacone of extinct mammals. = 研究人员研究了已灭绝哺乳动物的后锥体。
The paleontologist identified the species based on its metacone morphology. = 古生物学家根据其后锥体的形态鉴定了该物种。


现在完成时:
Scientists have documented the evolution of the metacone. = 科学家们已经记录了后锥体的进化。
Studies have shown variations in metacone size across different populations. = 研究表明，不同种群的后锥体大小存在差异。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the presence of the metacone was unknown. = 在发现之前，后锥体的存在是未知的。
They had already analyzed the metacone structure before the presentation. = 他们在演讲之前就已经分析了后锥体的结构。


将来时:
Researchers will investigate the metacone's role in chewing. = 研究人员将研究后锥体在咀嚼中的作用。
Future studies will focus on the development of the metacone. = 未来的研究将集中在后锥体的发育上。


虚拟语气:
If the metacone were larger, the chewing efficiency would be different. = 如果后锥体更大，咀嚼效率就会不同。
I wish I had known more about metacone morphology before the exam. = 我希望在考试前对后锥体的形态学有更多的了解。


被动语态:
The metacone was carefully measured using a microscope. = 后锥体用显微镜仔细测量。
The metacone's function is still being debated by scientists. = 后锥体的功能仍在科学家之间争论。


疑问句:
What is the function of the metacone in this species? = 在这个物种中，后锥体的功能是什么？
Does the size of the metacone correlate with diet? = 后锥体的大小是否与饮食相关？


否定句:
The fossil did not show a well-preserved metacone. = 化石没有显示出保存完好的后锥体。
This species does not have a prominent metacone. = 这个物种没有突出的后锥体。


PHRASE->
metacone morphology = 后锥体形态
metacone size = 后锥体大小
metacone development = 后锥体发育
metacone structure = 后锥体结构
metacone variation = 后锥体变异
