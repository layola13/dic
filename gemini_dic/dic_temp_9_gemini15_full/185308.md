词源：

The word "retrenchment" comes from the verb "retrench," which in turn comes from the Old French word "retrancher," meaning "to cut back" or "to cut off."  The prefix "re-" indicates "again" or "back," and "trancher" is related to the Latin word "transire," meaning "to cut across."  Therefore, the word's etymology literally implies "to cut back again."
