cravingness's:/ˈkreɪvɪŋnəsɪz/| n.|渴望；热切的欲望|The possessive form of "cravingness," indicating belonging to or relating to a strong desire or longing.  It's less common than "craving" itself.|例句：The child's cravingness's for sweets was almost unbearable.  孩子的对糖果的渴望几乎难以忍受。|近义词：longing's, yearning's, desire's|反义词：indifference's, apathy's


USAGE->
This word is unusual.  It's the possessive form of "cravingness," a noun already expressing a state. The possessive form is rarely used in this context.  Therefore, providing example sentences for different tenses is impractical.  It would be more natural to use "craving" or phrases expressing possession.

For example, instead of "the baby's cravingness's for milk," you'd say "the baby's craving for milk" or "the baby's intense desire for milk."

PHRASE->
Because "cravingness's" is grammatically awkward and rarely used, providing common phrases is not relevant.  It's better to use the word "craving" or related terms in phrases.  For example:

intense craving
uncontrollable craving
sugar craving
chocolate craving
drug craving
