词源:

The word "candido" ultimately derives from the Latin word "candidus," meaning "shining white," "bright," or "pure."  This original meaning extended metaphorically to describe someone with a bright, open, and honest character.  The shift in meaning from "white" to "honest" likely occurred because white was associated with purity and innocence in Roman culture.  Over time, the word evolved through various languages, eventually arriving in English as "candid" and its related forms like "candido."


用法说明:

As an adjective, "candido" describes someone or something characterized by honesty, frankness, and openness.  It can also refer to a person's complexion, suggesting a fair or pale skin tone.

However,  "candido" is less common in modern English than its synonym "candid".  While "candid" is widely used, "candido" has a more archaic or literary feel and might be encountered primarily in older texts or specialized contexts.  It's generally interchangeable with "candid" in its meaning relating to honesty and openness.

The word is typically used to describe:

* **People:** A candido person is straightforward and truthful in their communication.
* **Statements/Accounts:** A candido account is one that is honest and unbiased, revealing all the facts.
* **Appearance:**  A candido complexion is a pale or light skin tone.
