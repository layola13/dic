crystallization:/ˌkrɪstəlaɪˈzeɪʃən/| n. |结晶；晶体化；明确化|The process by which a solid forms, where the atoms or molecules are highly organized into a structure known as a crystal.  This can occur from a liquid or a gas. It also refers to the process of something becoming clear or definite. |例句：The crystallization of sugar from a syrup is a common example. 糖从糖浆中结晶是一个常见的例子。


The slow crystallization of his ideas led to a groundbreaking theory. 他思想的缓慢结晶导致了一个突破性的理论。|近义词：solidification, concretion, definition |反义词：amorphousness, vagueness


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The sugar crystallizes slowly. = 糖慢慢结晶。
Salt crystallization occurs naturally in many environments. = 盐的结晶在许多环境中自然发生。

一般过去时:
The solution crystallized overnight. = 溶液一夜之间结晶了。
The scientist observed the crystallization process carefully. = 科学家仔细观察了结晶过程。

现在完成时:
The chemist has completed the crystallization experiment. = 化学家完成了结晶实验。
The project has finally reached crystallization of its goals. = 该项目最终实现了其目标的明确化。

过去完成时:
The crystals had already formed before the analysis began. = 在分析开始之前，晶体已经形成了。
The team had completed the crystallization stage of the project by last week. = 团队在上周之前完成了项目的结晶阶段。

将来时:
The mixture will crystallize at a lower temperature. = 混合物将在较低的温度下结晶。
We will observe the crystallization process tomorrow. = 我们明天将观察结晶过程。


虚拟语气:
If the temperature were lower, the solution would crystallize more quickly. = 如果温度更低，溶液结晶会更快。
I wish the crystallization process were faster. = 我希望结晶过程更快。

被动语态:
The sugar was crystallized using a special technique. = 糖是用一种特殊的技术结晶的。
The solution is being crystallized in the laboratory. = 溶液正在实验室中结晶。

疑问句:
How long does the crystallization process take? = 结晶过程需要多长时间？
What factors affect the rate of crystallization? = 哪些因素会影响结晶的速度？

否定句:
The solution did not crystallize properly. = 溶液没有正确结晶。
The project hasn't yet reached a complete crystallization of ideas. = 项目尚未完全明确其思想。


PHRASE->
