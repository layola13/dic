词源:  The word "low-pitched" is a compound adjective. "Low" indicates a low frequency or position on a scale, while "pitched" refers to the musical pitch or tone of a sound.  Both words have Germanic origins. "Low" is from Old English *lāg, and "pitch" derives from Old French *pic, ultimately from Latin *picem ("pitch, tar").  The use of "pitch" to describe musical tone developed over time.
