词源:
The word "risotto" comes from the Italian word "riso," meaning "rice."  The suffix "-otto" is a diminutive, suggesting a smaller or more delicate version of something. Thus, "risotto" literally translates to something like "little rice."  The culinary meaning evolved over time, referring to the specific creamy rice dish prepared in a particular way.
