microclastic:/ˌmaɪkroʊˈklæstɪk/| adj.|微碎屑的，由微小碎屑组成的|Adjective describing rocks or sediments composed of very small fragments (clasts) of other rocks or minerals.  These fragments are typically less than 2 millimeters in diameter. The term highlights the small size of the constituent particles.|Example: The metamorphic rock showed a microclastic texture, indicating its formation from fine-grained materials.|近义词：fine-grained, clastic|反义词：macroclastic, crystalline
