词源：From "epitome," meaning a summary or abstract, ultimately derived from the Greek "epitome" (ἐπιτομή), meaning "a cutting short," "an abridgment," from "epi-" (ἐπί) meaning "upon," "on," "to," and "temnein" (τέμνειν), meaning "to cut."  The adjective form "epitomic" emerged later, reflecting the sense of something being a perfect and concise representation.
