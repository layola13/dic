词源:
The word "internalise" (and its American spelling "internalize") comes from the prefix "internal" (meaning "inside" or "inner") combined with the suffix "-ize" (meaning "to make or become").  The word thus literally means "to make internal" or "to become internal".  The process reflects a psychological or cognitive incorporation of external information or experience into one's own mental framework.
