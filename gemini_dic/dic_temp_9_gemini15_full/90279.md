The word "housel" does not exist in standard English.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis according to your requested format.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a very archaic or dialectal word, or a word from a specific fictional context.  If you can provide more context (e.g., where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
