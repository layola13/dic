The word "fied" does not exist as a standalone word in standard English.  It's likely a misspelling or a part of a larger word.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need more context.  Where did you encounter this word?  What was the surrounding text?  Knowing this would help determine its possible meaning and origin.
