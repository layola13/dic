词源:
The word "flurried" comes from the Middle English word "flurrien," meaning "to flutter" or "to be in a flurry."  This, in turn, is likely related to the Old Norse word "fluga," meaning "to fly."  The sense of quick, chaotic movement inherent in "flying" is reflected in the modern meaning of "flurried."
