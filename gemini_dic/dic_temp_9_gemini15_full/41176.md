词源:
The word "copyer" is derived from the verb "copy," meaning to reproduce something.  The suffix "-er" is an agent suffix, indicating a person or thing that performs the action of the verb.  The word's history traces back to the Middle English word "copien," ultimately from the Latin word "copiare," meaning "to copy."
