词源:  Derived from the verb "collect," meaning to bring together or gather, but in this context, it refers to the gathering or bringing together of one's mental and emotional faculties to achieve a state of calm and control.  The "-ness" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, signifying a state or quality.
