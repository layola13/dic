flexure:/ˈflɛkʃər/| n.|弯曲；挠曲；弯曲处|The bending of a member subjected to a load.  It refers to the deformation of a structural element under stress, resulting in a change of curvature. |例句：The flexure of the beam under heavy load was significant.  这根梁在重载荷下的弯曲非常显著。

The excessive flexure of the bridge caused concerns about its structural integrity. 桥梁过度弯曲引起了对其结构完整性的担忧。|近义词：bending, curvature, deflection|反义词：straightness, rigidity


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The beam experiences flexure under load. = 梁在载荷下发生弯曲。
Excessive flexure weakens the structure. = 过度弯曲会削弱结构。

一般过去时:
The bridge showed significant flexure after the earthquake. = 地震后桥梁出现了明显的弯曲。
The engineer analyzed the flexure of the component. = 工程师分析了部件的弯曲情况。

现在完成时:
The material has undergone considerable flexure. = 材料已经发生了相当大的弯曲。
The building has shown no signs of flexure. = 这座建筑物没有显示出任何弯曲迹象。

过去完成时:
The crack had formed due to prior flexure. = 裂缝是由于之前的弯曲造成的。
The analysis had revealed excessive flexure in the design. = 分析显示设计中存在过度弯曲。

将来时:
The structure will likely experience flexure under wind load. = 该结构很可能会在风载荷下发生弯曲。
The new design will minimize flexure. = 新的设计将最大限度地减少弯曲。

虚拟语气:
If the material were stronger, the flexure would be less. = 如果材料更坚固，弯曲程度就会更小。
It is crucial that the flexure remain within acceptable limits. = 弯曲必须保持在可接受的范围内至关重要。

被动语态:
The flexure was carefully measured by the engineers. = 工程师仔细测量了弯曲量。
The flexure is being monitored continuously. = 弯曲量正在持续监测中。

疑问句:
What is the maximum flexure allowed? = 允许的最大弯曲量是多少？
Is there any evidence of flexure in the data? = 数据中是否有任何弯曲的证据？

否定句:
The structure showed no significant flexure. = 结构没有显示出明显的弯曲。
There was no detectable flexure in the test specimen. = 测试样品没有检测到任何弯曲。


PHRASE->
flexure strength = 抗弯强度
flexure formula = 弯曲公式
point of contraflexure = 反弯点
flexural rigidity = 抗弯刚度
flexure test = 弯曲试验

词源:
From Latin *flexūra, from flectere "to bend".
