词源:
The word "holdout" comes from the verb "hold out," meaning to resist or refuse to give in.  The "-out" suffix indicates a person or thing that performs the action of holding out.  Its roots are in the Old English "haldan" (to hold) and the Old Norse "úti" (out).  The evolution reflects the gradual development of the meaning from simply "holding out" to "persisting in resistance."
