It derives from the Middle English word "licentious," which itself comes from the Old French "licencieus," meaning "without license" or "unlicensed."  The root is the Latin "licentia," meaning "freedom, permission, license," implying a lack of restraint.  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "licentious" into a noun, indicating a state or quality.
