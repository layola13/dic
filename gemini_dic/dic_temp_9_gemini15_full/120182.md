词源：The word "mindless" is formed by adding the prefix "mind-" (meaning "of the mind" or "mental") and the suffix "-less" (meaning "without").  Therefore, "mindless" literally means "without mind" or "lacking a mind."  Its usage evolved to describe not the absence of a mind itself, but the absence of thoughtful consideration or intelligence in actions or behavior.
