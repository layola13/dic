词源:
The word "indentment" comes from the Old French word "entaille," meaning "a cut, notch, or indentation."  The "in-" prefix indicates "in" or "into," and "-ment" is a noun suffix indicating the action or result of the verb "indent."  The legal meaning evolved from the practice of indenting or cutting documents to create matching copies, signifying a binding agreement.  The physical act of indenting thus gave rise to the abstract meaning of a formal agreement.
