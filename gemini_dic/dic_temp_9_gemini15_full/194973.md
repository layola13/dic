semi-rotary: /ˈsɛmiˈroʊtəri/ | adj. | 半旋转的；半回转的 |  Describes something that rotates partially or intermittently, not continuously in a full circle.  It often refers to mechanisms or movements that involve a partial rotation to achieve a specific function. | Example: The semi-rotary engine provided intermittent power to the pump.  半旋转发动机为泵提供间歇动力。| 近义词: partially rotating, intermittently rotating | 反义词: fully rotary, continuously rotating
