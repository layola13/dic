词源:
The word "sarrasin" comes from the Medieval French word for "Saracen," which referred to Muslims, particularly those from the Middle East and North Africa.  Buckwheat was introduced to Europe from Central Asia via the Middle East, so it became associated with the Saracens. Over time, the word "sarrasin" became solely associated with the grain itself.
