dehonestation:/ˌdiːˌɒnɪˈsteɪʃən/| n. |不诚实；欺诈；不正直|The word "dehonestation" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) possibly formed by combining elements suggesting "de-" (removal or lack of) and "honesty" with a suffix "-ation" indicating a process or state.  Therefore, a precise definition and usage examples cannot be provided.  If the intent was to create a word meaning "the act of making dishonest" or "the state of being dishonest,"  existing words like dishonesty, dissembling, deception, or fraud would be more appropriate. |There are no standard examples as the word is not in common usage. |近义词：dishonesty, deception, fraud, dissembling |反义词：honesty, integrity, truthfulness |noun
