prorealistic: /ˌproʊˌriːəˈlɪstɪk/ | adj. | 超现实主义的，极度现实的 |  This word combines "pro-" (meaning "very" or "excessively") and "realistic."  It describes something that goes beyond typical realism, either by exaggerating realistic elements to an extreme degree or by presenting a reality that is unsettlingly precise and detailed.  It doesn't have a widely established dictionary definition, so its usage is highly contextual. | Example:  The painting's prorealistic detail, capturing every pore and wrinkle, was both mesmerizing and disturbing.  这幅画的超现实主义细节，捕捉到了每一个毛孔和皱纹，既迷人又令人不安。 | 近义词: hyperrealistic, extremely realistic, intensely realistic | 反义词: unrealistic, idealistic, surreal (in the sense of being detached from reality)
