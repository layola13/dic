词源:
The word "quash" ultimately derives from the Old French word "quasser," meaning "to crush" or "to break."  This in turn has roots in the Vulgar Latin term "quassare,"  with the same general meaning.  The evolution of the word reflects a semantic shift from the literal act of crushing to the figurative suppression of something.
