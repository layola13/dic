词源:
The word "preservative" comes from the verb "preserve," meaning "to keep something in its original state," which in turn comes from the Old French word "preserver" and ultimately from the Latin "preservare" (to keep, guard, protect).  The suffix "-ative" indicates something that has the function of preserving.
