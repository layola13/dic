词源:
The term "full-on" is a relatively recent addition to the English lexicon, arising as an intensifying adverbial phrase in the latter half of the 20th century.  Its origins lie in colloquial speech, combining the adjective "full" (meaning complete or entire) with the adverb "on" (functioning here as an intensifier, similar to its use in phrases like "go on," "carry on"). The exact etymology is difficult to pinpoint due to its informal nature, but its usage reflects a trend toward intensifying language.
