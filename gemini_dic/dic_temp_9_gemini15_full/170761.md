词源:

* **pseudo-**:  From Greek *pseudes* meaning "false" or "lying".  This prefix is widely used to indicate something that is false or imitation.

* **charitably**: From "charity," ultimately derived from the Latin *caritas*, meaning "dearness," "love," and later "charity" in the sense of benevolent giving.  The suffix "-ably" forms an adverb, indicating "in a charitable manner."

Therefore, "pseudocharitably" literally means "in a falsely charitable manner."  The word combines the sense of false appearance with the action of giving or acting in a way that seems charitable.
