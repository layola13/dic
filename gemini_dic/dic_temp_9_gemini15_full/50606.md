USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the context of computer programming and does not have common usage in everyday speech or writing. Therefore, providing examples across various grammatical tenses and moods is not practical.  The word's usage is almost exclusively limited to describing the state of a pointer or reference after dereferencing.


PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases directly using "dereferenced".  Phrases involving pointers and memory access would be relevant in a programming context but not suitable for this format.  For instance, one might say  "the dereferenced value is null" in a programming context to discuss a program's behavior, but this is not a common phrase in general English.
