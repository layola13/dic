detritic: /dɪˈtrɪtɪk/ | adj. |碎屑的；由碎屑组成的|  relating to or consisting of detritus.  Detritic rocks are formed from fragments of other rocks. | 例句：The detritic sediments were deposited in a shallow marine environment.  这些碎屑沉积物沉积在一个浅海环境中。

The analysis revealed a high proportion of detritic material in the soil sample. 分析显示土壤样本中含有大量的碎屑物质。| 近义词：fragmental, clastic | 反义词：intact, crystalline

USAGE->

一般现在时:
The river carries detritic material downstream. = 河流向下游输送碎屑物质。
Detritic rocks are common in this geological formation. = 在这种地质构造中，碎屑岩很常见。


一般过去时:
The geologist identified the rock as detritic. = 地质学家将岩石鉴定为碎屑岩。
Heavy rains caused a significant increase in detritic load in the river. = 大雨导致河流中的碎屑物质负荷显著增加。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the formation of detritic sediments for decades. = 科学家们几十年来一直在研究碎屑沉积物的形成。
This area has accumulated a thick layer of detritic deposits over time. = 这个地区随着时间的推移积累了一层厚厚的碎屑沉积物。


过去完成时:
Before the flood, the riverbed had already accumulated a considerable amount of detritic matter. = 在洪水发生之前，河床已经积累了相当数量的碎屑物质。
The researchers had hypothesized that the rock formation was primarily detritic in origin. = 研究人员假设该岩层主要起源于碎屑。


将来时:
Further analysis will reveal the precise composition of the detritic sample. = 进一步的分析将揭示碎屑样本的精确成分。
The construction project will significantly alter the flow of detritic material in the river. = 建设项目将显著改变河流中碎屑物质的流动。


虚拟语气:
If the sample were purely detritic, the analysis would be much simpler. = 如果样本完全是碎屑的，分析就会简单得多。
I wish I had more time to study the origin of these detritic particles. = 我希望我有更多的时间来研究这些碎屑颗粒的起源。


被动语态:
The sample was carefully examined for detritic components. = 样本被仔细检查以寻找碎屑成分。
The rock formation is believed to have been formed from detritic sediments. = 人们认为该岩层是由碎屑沉积物形成的。


疑问句:
Is the rock primarily composed of detritic material? = 这块岩石主要由碎屑物质组成吗？
What is the source of the detritic sediments in this area? = 这个地区的碎屑沉积物的来源是什么？


否定句:
The rock is not entirely detritic; it also contains crystalline components. = 这块岩石并非完全是碎屑的；它也含有结晶成分。
The analysis did not reveal any significant amounts of detritic quartz in the sample. = 分析没有发现样品中含有任何大量的碎屑石英。


PHRASE->
detritic sediments = 碎屑沉积物
detritic rocks = 碎屑岩
detritic material = 碎屑物质
detritic deposits = 碎屑沉积
detritic origin = 碎屑成因


词源:  From detritus + -ic.  Detritus itself comes from the Latin word *dētritus*, meaning "worn down," "rubbish," or "waste."
