This word is extremely rare and not commonly used in everyday English.  It is derived from the word "material" and the suffix "-ness", which creates a noun indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, it refers to the quality or state of being material.  The meaning can be nuanced, depending on the context:

* **Physical substance:**  It can refer to the physical properties or existence of something.  For example, the "materialness" of a sculpture refers to its tangible form and the materials used to create it.

* **Importance or significance:** In a less literal sense, it can also refer to the importance or significance of something.  This usage is less frequent and often found in more formal or academic writing.

Because of its rarity, providing examples in different grammatical tenses, passive voice, etc., is impractical and would not be representative of its actual usage.  The word's meaning heavily relies on context, making specific grammatical examples less useful than simply understanding its core meaning.
