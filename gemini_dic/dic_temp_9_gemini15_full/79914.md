Researchers have determined the sample to be of gneissose origin. = 研究人员已经确定该样本源于片麻状岩石。


过去完成时:
They had already studied the gneissose layers before the expedition. = 在考察之前他们已经研究过片麻状岩层了。
The geologists had previously mapped the gneissose terrain. = 地质学家先前已经绘制了片麻状地形图。


将来时:

疑问句:
Is this rock gneissose? = 这块岩石是片麻状的吗？
Are these layers truly gneissose in nature? = 这些层本质上真的是片麻状的吗？


否定句:
The rock is not gneissose; it's massive. = 这块岩石不是片麻状的；它是块状的。
The texture is not uniformly gneissose throughout the sample. = 样本的纹理并非在整个样本中都均匀地呈现片麻状。


PHRASE->
