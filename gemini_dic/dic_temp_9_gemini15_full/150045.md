palpiger:/ˈpælpɪdʒər/| n.|触肢基节|The palpiger is a small, paired appendage found in some arthropods, particularly in the pycnogonids (sea spiders).  It is located near the mouth and is believed to have a sensory or manipulative function. While its exact function remains debated among scientists, it's generally thought to assist in feeding or sensing the environment.  The structure varies significantly depending on the species. | Example: The palpiger of the sea spider was observed to move rhythmically during feeding.  触肢基节在进食时被观察到有节奏地运动。|近义词：None (highly specific term)|反义词：None (highly specific term)|名词
