词源:
The word "decisively" is derived from the adjective "decisive," which comes from the Latin word "decīsus," the past participle of "dēcīdere," meaning "to cut off," "to decide," or "to determine."  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner in which something is done.
