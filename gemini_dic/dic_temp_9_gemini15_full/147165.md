/ˌoʊvərˈloʊnəsɪz/ | n. | 过低；过少；不足 | The overlownesses in the budget led to cuts in essential services. 预算中的不足导致了基本服务的削减。 | 近义词：insufficiencies, deficiencies, shortcomings | 反义词：abundance, surplus, excess |  名词


The word "overlownesses" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a non-standard or invented word, possibly combining "over" (meaning excessive or too much) with a form related to "lowness" (meaning a low state or condition), aiming to convey the idea of excessively low levels or amounts.  There is no established etymology or dictionary entry for this word.  It would be inappropriate to provide grammatical examples or phrases using this word as it's not part of standard English vocabulary.  If the intention was to convey a meaning of "excessively low levels," more appropriate and understandable words such as "insufficiencies," "deficiencies," or "shortcomings" should be used.
