combinators:/ˌkɒmbɪˈneɪtərz/ | n. | 组合子 |  In computer science, combinators are higher-order functions that can express computation without using variables. They are built from simpler combinators, often only a small set of primitives.  Combinators are particularly useful in functional programming, where they provide a concise and elegant way to represent complex computations. They are also used in lambda calculus. | Example: The combinator S (for "composition") is defined as Sxyz = xz(yz).  This means that applying S to three arguments x, y, and z is equivalent to applying x to z and then applying y to z.  Another combinator, K, is defined as Kxy = x. | 近义词:functional, operator | 反义词:N/A


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "what".  It describes a concept and therefore doesn't follow typical verb tense changes.  The usage examples below illustrate its application in sentences.
