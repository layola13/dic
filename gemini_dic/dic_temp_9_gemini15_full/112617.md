词源:

The term "low-cost" is a compound adjective formed from "low," meaning small in amount or degree, and "cost," referring to the amount of money needed to buy, make, or do something. Both words have Old English origins.  "Low" derives from Old English *lāg,  while "cost" comes from Old English *cost, related to the verb "to cost." The combination reflects the modern economic concept of minimizing expenditure.
