词源:
The word "cook" comes from the Old English word "cocian," meaning "to cook" or "to prepare food by heating."  This word itself has roots in the Proto-Germanic *kōkōn, further tracing back to Proto-Indo-European roots related to concepts of heat and boiling.  The modern English word has retained its core meaning across centuries.
