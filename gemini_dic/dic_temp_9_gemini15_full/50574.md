词源:
The word "deracinating" comes from the French word "déraciner," which means "to uproot."  The prefix "de-" means "to remove" or "from," and the root "racine" means "root." Therefore, "déraciner" literally means "to remove from the root."  The English word "deracinate" was adopted from French, carrying the same core meaning.
