词源:

* **quasi-**: From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost."
* **formidably**: From "formidable,"  ultimately derived from Old French *formidable*, from Latin *formidābilis*, from *formīdo* ("fear," "terror").

用法说明:

"Quasi-formidably" is primarily used as an adverb, modifying a verb or adjective to describe an action or quality that possesses a degree of formidableness but doesn't fully reach it.  It often implies a subtle understatement or a sense of near-but-not-quite.  It's a less common word, used in more formal or literary contexts.  It's not suitable for casual conversation.
