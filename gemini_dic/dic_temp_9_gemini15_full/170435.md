词源:

The word "proximious" derives from the Latin word "proximus," meaning "nearest" or "closest."  It's a less common, more formal variant of "proximate," sharing the same root and conveying a similar meaning.


用法说明:

虽然proximious 和 proximate 意思相近，但 proximious 更强调空间或时间上的紧密接近。Proximate 通常指更广泛意义上的接近，而 proximious 则暗示着比 "near" 更近的距离或时间。

由于其正式性，proximious 在日常口语中并不常见。它更常出现在学术写作或正式文件中。
