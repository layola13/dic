Enums are often used to represent a fixed set of options or states.|Example: enum Day { MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, SAT, SUN }; This defines an enum called `Day` with seven named constants representing the days of the week.  Each constant has an integer value, typically starting from 0.|近义词：enumeration, list, catalog|反义词：无|名词


USAGE->
This section is not applicable to a single word like "enum".  Enums are a programming language construct, not a verb or noun used in general English sentences in the way "what" is.  The usage examples would be code examples, not sentences.

Example C++ code:

enum class Color { Red, Green, Blue };

Color myFavoriteColor = Color::Red;

if (myFavoriteColor == Color::Red) {
  // Do something
}


Example Java code:

enum DayOfWeek {
  MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY
}

DayOfWeek today = DayOfWeek.MONDAY;

switch (today) {
  case MONDAY:
    // Do something
    break;
  case TUESDAY:
    // Do something else
    break;
  // ...and so on
}


PHRASE->
This section is also not directly applicable to "enum".  Phrases involving "enum" would be programming-specific and not common English phrases.  For instance, one might see "enum class" or "define an enum" in programming contexts.
