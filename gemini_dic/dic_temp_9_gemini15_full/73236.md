The word "forcite" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information following the requested format.  It may be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a technical term from a specific field, or a word from a fictional language.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer a more helpful response.
