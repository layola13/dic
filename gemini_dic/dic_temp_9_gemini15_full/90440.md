This request is impossible to fulfill completely as "HTC" is not a single word with a single meaning and etymology in the way "hello" is.  HTC is an acronym, not a word found in standard dictionaries.  Therefore, providing a full etymology, detailed usage instructions across various grammatical tenses, etc., is nonsensical.

However, I can provide information on HTC as it is commonly understood:

/ˌeɪtʃtiːˈsiː/ | n. |宏达电 (台湾手机制造商)| High Tech Computer Corporation, a Taiwanese multinational consumer electronics company that designs, manufactures, and sells smartphones, tablets, and virtual reality headsets.  | HTC is known for its innovative designs and high-quality products. |  近义词:  Samsung, Apple, Google (as competitors) | 反义词:  N/A (not applicable for a company name)


USAGE-> (Note: This is limited since HTC is a proper noun and not a verb or other part of speech that's conjugated)

HTC's role in sentences is typically as a proper noun:

* I own an HTC phone. = 我拥有一部HTC手机。
* HTC announced its new VR headset. = 宏达电发布了其新的VR头显。
* The company, formerly known as High Tech Computer Corporation, is now simply called HTC. = 这家公司，以前被称为高科技电脑公司，现在简称为HTC。


PHRASE-> (HTC is not typically used in phrases in the same way as "what" is.  Phrases involving HTC would typically revolve around its products or activities.)

* HTC Vive:  (HTC's VR headset)
* HTC One: (A line of HTC smartphones)
* HTC Sense: (HTC's user interface)
* HTC Desire: (A line of HTC smartphones)
* Buy an HTC phone: (Purchasing an HTC product)

The acronym HTC comes from the original name "High Tech Computer Corporation."  There isn't a deeper etymological breakdown as with words that have evolved over time.  The meaning is simply derived from the initial letters of the company's original name.
