The word "lalons" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical explanations as requested.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A proper noun:**  It could be a name (person, place, or thing) not found in common dictionaries.
* **A neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.
* **A word from another language:**  It's possible it's a word borrowed from another language.

If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, the surrounding text), I might be able to offer a more informed response.
