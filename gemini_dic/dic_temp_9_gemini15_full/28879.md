carpology:/kɑːrˈpɒlədʒi/ | n. | 果实学 | The branch of botany that deals with the study of fruits.  It encompasses the morphology, development, classification, and evolutionary aspects of fruits.  Carpology is a specialized field within botany, often focusing on the relationship between fruit structure and plant systematics. | The professor's research focuses on the carpology of tropical fruits.  教授的研究重点是热带水果的果实学。 |  pomology (in a broader sense), seed science |  (no direct antonym) | 名词
