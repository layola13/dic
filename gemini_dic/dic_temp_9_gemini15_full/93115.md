The word "iffiest" is not a standard English word found in dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a non-standard formation.  It might be intended as a superlative form of an adjective, attempting to convey a high degree of something negative or undesirable.  Without knowing the intended base word, a full analysis is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I'll address how you would analyze a word following the format if it *were* a legitimate word.

Let's assume "iffiest" was meant to be derived from a word like "iffy".

**Important Note:**  If "iffiest" was intended as a superlative of a different word, the analysis would change completely.  For instance, if it were a superlative of a made-up word, there's no way to provide a meaningful analysis without further context.  Please clarify the intended word or its context for a more accurate response.
