词源:

* **quasi-**:  from Latin *quasi* meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."

* **defiant**: from Old French *defiant*, from *defier* "to challenge," ultimately from Latin *deficere* "to fail," "to be lacking," implying a lack of compliance or respect for authority.


USAGE->
(Because "quasi-defiant" is an adjective, tense application doesn't apply directly.  The tense will apply to the verb it modifies.)

Example 1 (Present Simple): He remains quasi-defiant in the face of overwhelming evidence. 他面对压倒性的证据仍然表现出似是而非的反抗。

Example 2 (Past Simple):  She was quasi-defiant during the interrogation, refusing to answer directly.  她在审讯期间表现出似是而非的反抗，拒绝直接回答。


PHRASE->

(Phrases using "quasi-defiant" would depend on the context and would not be standard phrases like those shown in the example.  The word itself is not commonly used in fixed phrases.)  For example:  a quasi-defiant attitude, a quasi-defiant response, show quasi-defiant behavior,  express quasi-defiant feelings,  a quasi-defiant stare.
