词源:

The name "Leipzig" has a long and complex etymology, evolving from its earliest forms in Old High German.  The precise origin is debated by etymologists, but the most widely accepted theory connects it to a Slavic-origin place name meaning something akin to "settlement on the river Lippe" or a similar location-based descriptor.  Over centuries of linguistic evolution, the name transformed into its current form.  The precise Old High German root and its evolution through Middle High German and into Modern German is a subject of scholarly research and debate.
