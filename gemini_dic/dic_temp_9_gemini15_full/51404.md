determinism: /dɪˈtɜːrmɪnɪzəm/ | n. |决定论；宿命论 | The philosophical doctrine that all events are predetermined and inevitable.  It emphasizes the role of cause and effect, suggesting that free will is an illusion.  This can apply to various aspects, including human behavior, natural phenomena, and even the universe as a whole. | Example:  Hard determinism asserts that every event is causally determined and therefore inevitable.  硬决定论断言每一个事件都是因果决定的，因此是不可避免的。


Example:  The study explored the implications of genetic determinism on human behavior. 这项研究探讨了基因决定论对人类行为的影响。
