词源:The word "dishy" is a relatively recent addition to the English language, emerging in the mid-20th century. Its etymology is somewhat informal and reflects its colloquial nature. It's likely a playful alteration or intensifying of the word "dish," which can informally refer to a beautiful or attractive person, especially a woman.  The "-y" suffix adds an intensifying and somewhat subjective quality.  The connection to "dish" itself is likely rooted in the idea of something desirable and visually appealing, like a delicious dish of food.  There's no direct etymological link to older, established words.
