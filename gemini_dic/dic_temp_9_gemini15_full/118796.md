词源:

The word "metalware" is a compound word formed from "metal" and "ware."  "Metal" derives from Old French *metal, from Latin metallum "mine, metal," of unknown origin. "Ware" originates from Old English wara, meaning "goods, merchandise."  Therefore, "metalware" literally means "goods or merchandise made of metal."
