/ˌsiːˌɛfˈsiːz/ | n. |氟氯碳化物|Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are a group of man-made organic compounds that contain carbon, chlorine, and fluorine. They were widely used as refrigerants, propellants, and solvents before their damaging effects on the ozone layer were discovered.  CFCs are harmful to the environment because they contribute to ozone depletion in the stratosphere, leading to increased levels of harmful ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth's surface.|The widespread use of CFCs led to a significant thinning of the ozone layer.|近义词：Freon (a specific type of CFC)|反义词：无


USAGE->
