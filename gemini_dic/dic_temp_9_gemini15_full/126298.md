myodynamometer:/ˌmaɪoʊdaɪnæˈmɒmɪtər/| n. |肌动力计|A myodynamometer is an instrument used to measure the strength of muscles.  It assesses muscle function by quantifying the force a muscle or muscle group can generate.  Different types of myodynamometers exist, each designed to measure different muscle groups or types of contractions (isometric, isotonic, isokinetic).|The physical therapist used a myodynamometer to assess the patient's leg strength after surgery.|近义词：muscle strength tester, dynamometer (more general)|反义词：N/A
