The word "fogydom" does not exist in the English language.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries or etymology resources.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis using the requested format.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a neologism (newly coined word): If it's a very recent invention, it might not be in dictionaries yet.
* It's a word from another language:  If it's from another language, please specify the language so I can attempt a translation and analysis.

Please provide more information or a corrected spelling so I can assist you.
