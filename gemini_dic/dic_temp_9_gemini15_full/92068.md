PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "hyperprophetical."  Its rarity prevents established phrasal usage. The word itself functions as an intensifier for "prophetical" or "hypothetical".


词源:
The word is a combination of "hyper-" (meaning "excessive" or "beyond") and "prophetical" (relating to prophecy or prediction).  Therefore, it literally means "excessively prophetic" or "beyond prophetic."
