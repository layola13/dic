preliberating: /ˌpriːlɪbəˈreɪtɪŋ/ | adj. |  解放前的；解放之前的；预解放的 |  Describing something that existed or occurred before a period of liberation or emancipation.  This word is not commonly used and is likely a neologism or rarely used term.  It's formed by combining "pre-" (before) and "liberating" (the act of setting free).  Therefore, it implies a state or condition before freedom was achieved. | Example: The preliberating social structures were oppressive and hierarchical.  解放前的社会结构是压迫性和等级森严的。| 近义词: antebellum (referring specifically to the period before the American Civil War), pre-emancipation | 反义词: postliberation, postemancipation |  adj.
