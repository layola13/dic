词源:
The word "nonpredatory" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "predatory," which derives from the Latin word "praedator," meaning "plunderer" or "robber."  The "-ory" suffix is adjectival, meaning "relating to" or "characterized by." Therefore, "nonpredatory" means "not relating to plundering or robbing."
