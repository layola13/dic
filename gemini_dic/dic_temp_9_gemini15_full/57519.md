词源:
The word "dragoon" ultimately derives from the French word *dragon*, meaning "dragon".  This is because early dragoons were often depicted with dragon imagery on their uniforms or banners. However, the connection to dragons is mostly symbolic, and not literal. The modern military meaning developed from the 17th-century French cavalry unit called *dragons*, which were a hybrid of mounted and dismounted infantry, known for their aggressive tactics.  The English adopted the term, and its meaning broadened to encompass the act of forceful coercion.
