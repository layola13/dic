词源:
The word "ranging" comes from the Old French word "ranger," meaning "to arrange," "to set in order," or "to place." This Old French word ultimately derives from the Vulgar Latin word "rangare," which had a similar meaning.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the idea of extending over a certain area or distance.
