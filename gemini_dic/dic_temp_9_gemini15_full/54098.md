词源:
The word "disembogue" comes from the Old French "desemboguer," which literally means "to disembark from a boat."  The "des-" prefix means "out of" or "from," while "emboguer" relates to a river mouth or estuary.  The meaning evolved to encompass the broader sense of flowing out or emerging from a confined space.
