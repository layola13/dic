The word "metayage" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It is possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or related word?

2. **It's a neologism or technical term:**  It might be a newly coined word, a term specific to a particular field (e.g., a niche area of science, technology, or a specific dialect), or an invented word within a fictional context.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, it might help in determining its meaning.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or place name that hasn't been included in general dictionaries.

Please provide more information so I can assist you better.
