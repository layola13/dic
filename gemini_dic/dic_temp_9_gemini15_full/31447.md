词源:  The word "charlady" is a contraction of "charwoman," which itself comes from "char" (meaning "to do odd jobs, work casually") + "woman."  The "char" element has its roots in Middle English, possibly connected to the French word "charrier" (to carry, to convey).  The term developed specifically to describe women working in domestic cleaning and other tasks, highlighting the nature of their employment as often casual or part-time.
