词源:

The word derives from "landlord" + "-ship," a suffix that forms nouns indicating status, condition, or skill. "Landlord" itself comes from "land" (referring to property) and "lord" (meaning owner or possessor).  Therefore, "landlordships" signifies the "state of being a landlord."


用法说明：

Landlordships is primarily used in formal contexts and is not as frequent as "landlord" itself.

The plural form is used when referring to multiple instances of being a landlord or multiple properties under ownership.
