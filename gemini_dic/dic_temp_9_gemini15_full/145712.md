词源:
The word "overcovetously" is formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great degree) to the adverb "covetously."  "Covetously" derives from the verb "covet," which comes from the Old French word "coveiter" (to desire eagerly) and ultimately from the Latin "cupere" (to desire).
