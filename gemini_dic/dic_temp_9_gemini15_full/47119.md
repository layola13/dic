词源:

The word "dauntingnesses" is derived from the adjective "daunting," which itself originates from the verb "daunt."  "Daunt" comes from the Old French word "donter," meaning "to subdue, tame, overcome."  The suffix "-ing" transforms "daunt" into a present participle, and the suffix "-ness" changes the participle into a noun, signifying a quality or state.  The final "-es" is a plural marker. Therefore, "dauntingnesses" refers to multiple aspects or instances of being daunting.
