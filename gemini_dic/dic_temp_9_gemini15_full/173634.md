quasi-internally: /ˈkwɑːzaɪ ɪnˈtɜːrnəli/ | adj. | 准内部的；近乎内部的 |  Describes something that resembles or approximates an internal state or property, but doesn't fully meet the criteria for being truly internal. It suggests a partial or approximate internal characteristic.  | The model exhibits quasi-internally consistent behavior, meaning its internal elements largely agree, but with minor discrepancies. | 近义词：partially internal, near-internal, almost internal | 反义词：externally, completely external


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The system shows quasi-internally consistent results. = 系统显示出近乎一致的内部结果。
This process demonstrates quasi-internally driven behavior. = 这个过程表现出近乎内部驱动的行为。


一般过去时:
The data indicated a quasi-internally consistent pattern. = 数据显示出近乎一致的内部模式。
The experiment revealed quasi-internally generated signals. = 实验揭示了近乎内部产生的信号。


现在完成时:
Researchers have observed quasi-internally consistent responses. = 研究人员已经观察到近乎一致的内部反应。
The analysis has shown quasi-internally coordinated actions. = 分析显示出近乎内部协调的动作。


过去完成时:
Scientists had already identified quasi-internally consistent features. = 科学家们早已识别出近乎一致的内部特征。
The team had found quasi-internally related components. = 该团队已经发现了近乎内部相关的组件。


将来时:
Future studies will investigate quasi-internally generated phenomena. = 未来的研究将调查近乎内部产生的现象。
We will explore quasi-internally consistent models. = 我们将探索近乎一致的内部模型。


虚拟语气:
If the system were perfectly internal, it wouldn't exhibit quasi-internally consistent behavior. = 如果系统是完全内部的，它就不会表现出近乎一致的内部行为。
I wish the data showed truly internally consistent results, not just quasi-internally. = 我希望数据显示的是真正一致的内部结果，而不仅仅是近乎一致的。


被动语态:
Quasi-internally consistent relationships were observed in the data. = 在数据中观察到近乎一致的内部关系。
The quasi-internally generated signal is being analyzed. = 正在分析近乎内部产生的信号。


疑问句:
Is the model truly internally consistent, or only quasi-internally? = 该模型是真正内部一致的，还是仅仅是近乎内部一致的？
Are the observed patterns truly internal, or only quasi-internally generated? = 观察到的模式是真正内部的，还是仅仅是近乎内部产生的？


否定句:
The system does not exhibit fully internally consistent behavior; it is only quasi-internally consistent. = 该系统没有表现出完全内部一致的行为；它只是近乎内部一致的。
The results were not truly internally consistent; they were only quasi-internally consistent. = 结果并非真正内部一致；它们只是近乎内部一致的。


PHRASE->
quasi-internally consistent system = 近乎内部一致的系统
quasi-internally driven process = 近乎内部驱动的过程
quasi-internally generated signal = 近乎内部产生的信号
quasi-internally related components = 近乎内部相关的组件
quasi-internally coordinated actions = 近乎内部协调的动作
