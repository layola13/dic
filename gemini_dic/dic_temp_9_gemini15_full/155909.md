photoclinometry:/ˌfoʊtoʊklɪˈnɒmətri/ | n. | 摄影倾斜测量法 | The measurement of slopes and gradients using photographic techniques.  It involves taking photographs from a known position and using the resulting images to determine the angles of slopes.  This technique is commonly used in geographic information systems (GIS) and surveying. | Example: Photoclinometry was employed to map the steep slopes of the volcano. 摄影倾斜测量法被用来绘制火山陡峭斜坡的地图。| 近义词:slope measurement, gradient analysis | 反义词: N/A
