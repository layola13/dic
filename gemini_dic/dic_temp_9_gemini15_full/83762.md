词源：The word combines "hair" and "brain," suggesting a lack of substance or rationality, like a brain made of hair.  The implication is that the brain is light, fluffy, and unconcerned with practicality.  The "hair" element suggests a lack of seriousness or weight.  While the precise origin date is difficult to pinpoint, its usage reflects a long-standing association of hair with frivolousness or lack of substance.
