词源:  Derived from the adjective "plausible," which comes from the Late Latin word "plausibilis," meaning "worthy of applause" or "deserving approval."  This in turn originates from the Latin verb "plaudere," meaning "to applaud" or "to clap."


英文解析: Plausibleness refers to the quality or state of being plausible;  the appearance of being true, real, or likely. It suggests that something is believable or reasonable, even if it may not be entirely true or provable.  A high degree of plausibleness increases the acceptance or belief in something.


例句:

The plausibleness of the defendant's alibi was a key factor in the trial.  被告不在场证明的可信度是审判中的一个关键因素。

The scientist presented his findings with a great deal of plausibleness, convincing many of his theory. 科学家以极高的可信度呈现了他的发现，使许多人相信了他的理论。


近义词:

credibility (可信度):  The quality of being believable or trustworthy.
believability (可信度): The extent to which something is believable.
likelihood (可能性): The chance or probability of something happening.
probability (概率):  The extent to which something is likely to happen.


反义词:

implausibility (不可信): The quality of being improbable or unbelievable.
unlikelihood (可能性小):  The state of being improbable or unlikely.


注意：由于"plausibleness"本身是一个名词，所以没有动词、形容词等其他词性变化。  它的用法主要在于描述事物的可信程度。
