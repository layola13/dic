近义词：coquettishly, teasingly, playfully, suggestively | 反义词：seriously, modestly, demurely


词源:  Derived from "flirtatious," which in turn comes from "flirt,"  meaning to behave amorously without serious intentions. The suffix "-iously" denotes a manner or way of doing something.  The ultimate origin is uncertain, but some etymologists suggest a possible connection to Dutch words related to "fluttering" or "flying," possibly referring to the light, fluttering movements associated with flirtatious behavior.
