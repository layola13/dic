precoloring: /ˌpriːˈkʌləriŋ/ | n. | 预着色，预先着色 | The act of coloring something beforehand, often as a preparatory step in a larger process.  This term is commonly used in graph theory and computer science, referring to assigning colors to certain vertices or elements before the complete coloring process begins.  | Example:  The precoloring of the nodes significantly reduced the complexity of the graph coloring algorithm.  预先给节点着色大大降低了图着色算法的复杂性。 | 近义词：pre-assignment, prior coloring | 反义词：postcoloring, final coloring | 名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "What is...?"  Its usage focuses on the act or process itself.  Therefore, typical verb tenses and voice structures won't apply.  Examples illustrating its usage in different contexts are provided below.


Example Sentences illustrating different contexts:

1.  The effectiveness of the algorithm depends heavily on the initial precoloring strategy.  算法的有效性很大程度上取决于初始预着色策略。

2.  With a careful precoloring phase, we were able to achieve optimal results in a shorter time. 通过仔细的预着色阶段，我们能够在更短的时间内获得最佳结果。

3.  The research paper analyzed various precoloring techniques for constraint satisfaction problems.  这篇研究论文分析了约束满足问题的各种预着色技术。

4.  Precoloring is a crucial step in many optimization problems involving graph coloring. 预着色是许多涉及图着色的优化问题中的一个关键步骤。


PHRASE->
Precoloring techniques,  Optimal precoloring,  Partial precoloring,  Precoloring constraints,  Precoloring problem
