词源:
The word "deformable" is derived from the verb "deform," which itself comes from the Old French word "deformer," meaning "to disfigure" or "to alter the form of."  The prefix "de-" indicates removal or reversal, and "form" refers to shape or structure.  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or susceptibility.  Therefore, "deformable" literally means "capable of being altered in form."
