The word "humblers" does not exist as a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word, such as "humbler," "humblers" (plural of humbler), or a word with a similar spelling.  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **A newly coined word or slang:** It's possible this word is very recent, regional slang, or specific to a particular field or community.  More context is needed.

3. **A proper noun:**  It could be a name or place name.


To provide the requested analysis, I need clarification on the intended word. If you can provide more context (sentence where you encountered the word, intended meaning, etc.), I can offer a more accurate analysis.
