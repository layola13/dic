词源:

The word "distempered" comes from the Old French word "destemprer," meaning "to disturb the temperament of,"  ultimately deriving from the Latin "dis-" (apart, away) and "temperare" (to mix, temper).  The meaning related to illness reflects the historical understanding of disease as an imbalance of the body's humors. The artistic use refers to the mixing of pigments with a binder.
