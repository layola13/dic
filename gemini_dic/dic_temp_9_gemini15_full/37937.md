词源:
The word "completing" comes from the verb "complete," which originates from the Latin word "complere," meaning "to fill up," "to fulfill," or "to finish."  The prefix "com-" indicates "together," and the root "-ple" is related to the word "plethora," suggesting fullness or abundance. Therefore, "complete" originally meant to fill something up completely, leading to its modern meaning of finishing or making something whole.
