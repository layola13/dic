反义词：civilized, cultured, refined, sophisticated


词源:  The word is a combination of "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partially") and "savage" (meaning "fierce," "untamed," or "uncivilized").  The root of "savage" can be traced back to the Old French word "sauvage," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "silvaticus," meaning "of the woods" or "wild."  This reflects the historical association of savagery with people living outside of settled, civilized societies.
