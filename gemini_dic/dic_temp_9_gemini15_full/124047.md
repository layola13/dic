morphic:/ˈmɔːrfɪk/| adj.|形态的；变形的；形态发生的| Relating to or denoting form or structure.  The term often refers to the form and structure of living organisms, but can also apply to other systems.  It is frequently used in biology, particularly in developmental biology and genetics, to describe processes that shape the form of an organism.|例句：The study focused on the morphic changes in the cells during development. 这项研究关注细胞在发育过程中的形态变化。
例句：The morphic fields influence the pattern formation in the embryo. 形态场影响胚胎的模式形成。|近义词：structural, formative, developmental|反义词：amorphous, formless
