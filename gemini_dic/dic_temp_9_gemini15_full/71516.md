词源:
The word "flannelling" derives from the noun "flannel," a soft woolen fabric.  The verb's meaning likely arose from the idea of something soft, indistinct, or obscuring, like the texture of flannel, being used to cover or mask something else.  The sense of evasion and procrastination developed metaphorically from this initial association with a soft, woolly texture.
