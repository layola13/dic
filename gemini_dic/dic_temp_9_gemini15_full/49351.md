词源：
The word "definition" comes from the Middle English word "definicioun,"  itself derived from the Old French "definicion" and ultimately from the Latin "definītiō," a combination of "dē-" (down, away) and "fīnīre" (to limit, to bound).  The Latin root reflects the sense of establishing clear boundaries of meaning.
