PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "pettifogulize".  The word itself is a rather formal and infrequent term.  Phrases would incorporate its meaning, such as:  "engage in pettifogging," "pettifogging tactics," "petty pettifogging."

词源:
The word "pettifogulize" is derived from "pettifogger," which itself comes from "petty" (small, insignificant) and "fog" (to obscure or confuse).  A pettifogger was originally a lawyer who dealt with petty cases and used obscure legal arguments, and the verb "pettifogulize" follows this meaning, emphasizing the act of such behavior.
