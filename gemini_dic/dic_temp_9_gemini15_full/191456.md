schizocoele:/ˈskɪzoʊsiːl/| n. |裂体腔|A schizocoele is a body cavity formed by the splitting of the mesoderm, the middle layer of cells in an embryo, during development.  This is in contrast to an enterocoelic cavity, which forms from outpocketings of the archenteron (primitive gut). Schizocoeles are characteristic of protostomes, a major group of animals including mollusks, annelids, and arthropods.|例句：The development of the schizocoele is a crucial step in the formation of the coelom in protostomes.|近义词：coelom (in the context of a body cavity formed by splitting)|反义词：enterocoel (body cavity formed by enterocoely)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The schizocoele develops during gastrulation. = 裂体腔在原肠胚形成期间发育。
Schizocoely is a common feature in protostomes.= 裂体腔形成是原口动物的常见特征。

一般过去时:
Researchers studied the formation of the schizocoele in the embryo. = 研究人员研究了胚胎中裂体腔的形成。
The schizocoele was fully formed by day five. = 到第五天，裂体腔已经完全形成。


现在完成时:
