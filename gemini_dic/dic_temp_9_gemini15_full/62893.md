词源:

The word "enlightener" is derived from the verb "enlighten," which itself comes from the Old English "onlihtnian," meaning "to shine upon," "to illuminate."  The prefix "en-" is intensifying, and "lighten" relates to light and understanding.  The "-er" suffix turns the verb into a noun denoting a person who performs the action.  The word's modern usage is strongly tied to the 18th-century European Enlightenment, a philosophical movement emphasizing reason and individualism.


用法说明:


This word is primarily a noun, referring to individuals who promote intellectual or moral progress.  It can refer to specific historical figures associated with the Enlightenment, as well as to anyone who spreads knowledge and understanding in a broader sense.
