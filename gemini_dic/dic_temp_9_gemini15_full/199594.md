词源:
The word "sinisterly" derives from the adjective "sinister," which comes from the Latin word "sinister," meaning "left." In ancient Roman culture, the left side was associated with evil and misfortune, hence the negative connotation.  Over time, the word's meaning shifted to encompass wickedness and threat.
