词源:

pasture (n.) + land (n.)

"Pasture" comes from the Old French *pasture, from pasturer "to pasture, feed (animals)," from pasturage "pasture, grazing," from Latin pascere "to feed."  "Land" is from Old English land, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch land and German Land.  Therefore, "pastureland" is a compound noun directly describing land used for pasturing animals.
