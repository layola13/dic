词源:
The word "phosphine" is derived from the combination of "phosphorus" and the suffix "-ine," a common suffix used to denote hydrides (compounds containing hydrogen).  Phosphorus itself comes from the Greek words "phos" (light) and "phoros" (bearing), referring to its ability to glow in the dark.
