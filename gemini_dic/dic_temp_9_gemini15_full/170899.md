pseudomalachite:/ˌsuːdoʊˈmæləkaɪt/| n. |假绿铜矿|A secondary copper mineral, a hydrated copper phosphate, that is green in color and often forms in botryoidal or stalactitic masses.  It is sometimes mistaken for malachite due to its similar appearance. |Example: The specimen displayed a beautiful, though deceptive, cluster of pseudomalachite.  这个标本展示了一簇美丽但具有欺骗性的假绿铜矿。|近义词：copper phosphate,  (in appearance) malachite|反义词：无
