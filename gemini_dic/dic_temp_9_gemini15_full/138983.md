词源:
The word "nympha" comes from the ancient Greek word νύμφη (numphe), meaning "bride," "maiden," or "young woman."  Its mythological usage evolved to describe these nature spirits, often associated with fertility and beauty.  The entomological use derives from the resemblance of the immature insect to a smaller, developing version of the adult, mirroring the growth and development of a young woman.
