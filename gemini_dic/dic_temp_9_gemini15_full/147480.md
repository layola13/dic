词源:  The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively) and "orchestrate" (from "orchestra," ultimately from Greek *orkhēstra, "dancing place," referring to the place where the chorus and musicians performed in ancient Greek theatre).  The meaning evolved to encompass the arrangement and coordination of elements, often in a musical context, and now extends to the figurative sense of meticulous planning to an excessive degree.
