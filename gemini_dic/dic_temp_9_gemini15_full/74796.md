The word "fremed" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a dialect or jargon, or a proper noun.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need clarification on the intended word or context in which "fremed" was used.
