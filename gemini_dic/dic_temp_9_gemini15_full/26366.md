词源:

The phrase "by halves" is a combination of the preposition "by" and the noun "halves" (plural of "half").  It likely evolved from the literal meaning of doing something in "halves," implying incompleteness, and over time took on the figurative meaning of doing something inadequately.  There isn't a specific documented historical origin readily available, but its meaning is clearly derived from its constituent parts.
