prestimuluses:/ˌpriːˈstɪmjʊləsiːz/| n.|刺激物（复数）|Stimuli that precede a primary stimulus, often influencing the response to the primary stimulus.  They are used in experimental settings to prepare or condition a subject for a later, more important stimulus.|例句：The researchers used prestimuluses of varying intensity to assess their effect on the participants' reaction times. 研究人员使用了不同强度的预刺激来评估其对参与者反应时间的影响。|近义词：antecedents, precursors|反义词：post-stimuli


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Prestimuluses influence the response to the primary stimulus. = 预刺激影响对主要刺激的反应。
Researchers carefully select prestimuluses for their experiments. = 研究人员仔细选择实验的预刺激。


一般过去时:
The experiment used auditory prestimuluses. = 实验使用了听觉预刺激。
Researchers analyzed the effects of the different prestimuluses. = 研究人员分析了不同预刺激的影响。


现在完成时:
Scientists have used prestimuluses in numerous studies. = 科学家们已经在许多研究中使用了预刺激。
Researchers have observed significant variations in responses due to prestimuluses. = 研究人员已经观察到由于预刺激而导致的反应的显著变化。


过去完成时:
The participants had already been exposed to the prestimuluses before the main experiment began. = 在主要实验开始之前，参与者已经接触过预刺激。
They had considered the potential bias introduced by the prestimuluses.  = 他们已经考虑了预刺激引入的潜在偏差。


将来时:
Future studies will investigate the long-term effects of prestimuluses. = 未来研究将调查预刺激的长期影响。
Researchers will use more sophisticated prestimuluses in their next experiment. = 研究人员将在他们的下一个实验中使用更复杂的预刺激。


虚拟语气:
If we had different prestimuluses, the results might have been different. = 如果我们有不同的预刺激，结果可能会有所不同。
It is important that the prestimuluses are carefully controlled. = 预刺激必须小心控制，这一点很重要。


被动语态:
The prestimuluses were carefully calibrated before the experiment. = 预刺激在实验前经过仔细校准。
The effects of the prestimuluses were analyzed statistically. = 预刺激的影响经过统计分析。


疑问句:
What types of prestimuluses were used in the study? = 研究中使用了哪些类型的预刺激？
How did the prestimuluses affect the participants' behaviour? = 预刺激如何影响参与者的行为？


否定句:
The experiment did not use any visual prestimuluses. = 该实验没有使用任何视觉预刺激。
There were no significant differences observed between the groups with and without prestimuluses. = 在使用和不使用预刺激的两组之间，没有观察到显著差异。


PHRASE->
types of prestimuluses = 预刺激类型
effects of prestimuluses = 预刺激的影响
control of prestimuluses = 预刺激的控制
selection of prestimuluses = 预刺激的选择
design of prestimuluses = 预刺激的设计
