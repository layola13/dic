词源:
The word "dimple" ultimately derives from the Old French word *dimpler*, meaning "to indent," which in turn has its roots in the Latin word *dimplere*, meaning "to fill up" (with a sense of fullness or roundness that then implies a depression).  The semantic shift from "fill" to "indent" is an example of a semantic bleaching or weakening, where the original meaning is lost or significantly altered over time.
