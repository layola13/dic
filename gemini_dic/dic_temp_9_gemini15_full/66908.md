词源：

The word "expeditiously" is derived from the Latin word "expeditus," meaning "free from entanglement, unobstructed, ready for action."  The suffix "-ously" denotes manner or quality.  Therefore, "expeditiously" literally means "in a manner free from obstruction," implying speed and efficiency.
