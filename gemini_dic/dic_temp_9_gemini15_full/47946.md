decidable: /dɪˈsaɪdəbl/ | adj. | 可判定的，可确定的 | Capable of being decided or determined; solvable.  A decidable problem is one for which an algorithm can be constructed to determine whether any given instance of the problem has a solution.  This is a key concept in computability theory. |


例句：

The question of whether the universe is infinite is not decidable. = 宇宙是否无限的问题是不可判定的。

This mathematical problem is decidable in polynomial time. = 这个数学问题可以在多项式时间内判定。


近义词：determinable, solvable, resolvable


反义词：undecidable, unsolvable, irresolvable


词源:  From "decide" + "-able".  "Decide" ultimately derives from Latin *decidere, from *de- (down) + *caedere (to cut, to fall).  The sense of "to bring to a conclusion" developed from the idea of "cutting short" or "bringing to an end".


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The problem is decidable. = 这个问题是可判定的。
This question is decidable by simple observation. = 通过简单的观察就能判定这个问题。


一般过去时:
The theorem was decidable within the framework. = 在这个框架内，该定理是可判定的。
The issue was quickly decidable after the evidence emerged. = 证据出现后，这个问题很快就被解决了。


现在完成时:
The matter has been decidable since the new evidence appeared. = 自从新的证据出现以来，这个问题是可以判定的。
Many previously undecidable problems have become decidable with the advent of new technologies. = 随着新技术的出现，许多以前不可判定的问题已经变得可判定了。


过去完成时:
The case had been decidable before the appeal was filed. = 在上诉提出之前，此案是可以判定的。
The question had already been decidable when the debate started. = 辩论开始时，这个问题已经可以判定了。


将来时:
The result will be decidable after further analysis. = 进一步分析后，结果将是可以判定的。
This problem will be decidable once we have access to more data. = 一旦我们获得更多数据，这个问题将是可以判定的。


虚拟语气:
If the problem were decidable, we could find a solution. = 如果这个问题是可判定的，我们就能找到解决方案。
I wish this question were decidable. = 我希望这个问题是可判定的。


被动语态:
The issue was decided by the committee. = 这个问题由委员会决定。
The matter is being decided as we speak. = 我们说话的时候，这个问题正在被决定。


疑问句:
Is this problem decidable? = 这个问题是可判定的吗？

否定句:
The problem is not decidable. = 这个问题是不可判定的。
The matter is not yet decidable. = 这个问题还没有得到解决。


PHRASE->

There is no readily available phrase using "decidable" as a key component in the same way the example uses "what".  The word is primarily used in technical contexts.  However, we can illustrate its usage in phrases like:

Decidable in principle: 从原则上讲是可判定的
Computationally decidable: 计算上可判定的
Decidable in polynomial time: 多项式时间内可判定
Highly decidable: 高度可判定的
Effectively decidable: 有效可判定的
