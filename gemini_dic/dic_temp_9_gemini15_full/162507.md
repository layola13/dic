词源:  The word "preaggravate" is a relatively rare word, formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") with "aggravate." While "aggravate" has a long history, the combination "preaggravate" is less common and often considered redundant, as "aggravate" already implies a worsening of an existing condition.  Therefore, specific historical etymology for "preaggravate" itself is not readily available.
