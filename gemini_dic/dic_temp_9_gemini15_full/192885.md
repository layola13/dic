The word "seasoninglike" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a newly coined word, possibly a blend of "seasoning" and "like," intended to describe something resembling seasoning or having seasoning-like qualities.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is not possible.  To provide a response that fulfills the format, I will analyze the individual words "seasoning" and "like" and then speculate on potential uses of the non-existent "seasoninglike."


**Seasoning:**

/ˈsiːzənɪŋ/ | n. | 调味料，佐料 | Substances used to enhance the flavor of food.  Examples include herbs, spices, salt, and pepper.  | The chef added seasoning to the soup to improve its taste. |  spice, condiment, flavoring | bland, tasteless | noun


**Like:**

/laɪk/ | prep., conj., adj., v. | 像，喜欢，类似 |  Expressing similarity, preference, or comparison. | I like pizza. | similar, resembling, as | dislike, hate | preposition, conjunction, adjective, verb


**Speculative Analysis of "Seasoninglike" (Non-existent word):**

If "seasoninglike" were to exist, it would likely function as an adjective meaning "resembling seasoning" or "having the qualities of seasoning."


**Hypothetical Usage of "Seasoninglike":**

It could be used in a sentence like:  "The sauce had a seasoninglike aroma, even though it contained no actual spices."  This implies a similarity in smell or flavor profile to seasoning, but not an exact match.


Because "seasoninglike" is not a real word, I cannot provide examples for all tenses, voices, and sentence structures requested in the format.  Similarly, phrases and near/antonyms are not applicable.  The word would need to be established in common usage before such analysis could be performed.
