USAGE->
一般现在时:
This word is an adjective, not a verb, so it does not conjugate in tenses like "present simple."  It's simply used to describe a state.  Example: The ded leaves are scattered on the ground. = 死去的叶子散落在地上。


一般过去时:
Similar to present simple, it doesn't change. Example: The ded soldier was honored for his bravery. =这位已故的士兵因其勇敢而受到表彰。


现在完成时:
Again, as an adjective, it doesn't change tense. Example: The books of the ded author are still popular. =这位已故作者的书仍然很受欢迎。


过去完成时:
Same as above. Example: They learned that their ded relative had left them a large inheritance. =他们得知他们已故的亲戚给他们留下了巨额遗产。


将来时:
The adjective "ded" simply describes the state of being dead and doesn't project into the future.  You would use future tenses with verbs describing actions related to the deceased, not the adjective itself. Example:  They will visit the grave of their ded grandfather next week. =他们下周将去探望他们已故祖父的坟墓。


虚拟语气:
Again, "ded" doesn't change. The verb would be conjugated in the subjunctive. Example: If my grandfather were still alive, he would be proud. =如果我的祖父还活着，他会很骄傲。（ded is implied, not directly used in the subjunctive phrasing）


被动语态:
"Ded" doesn't participate in passive voice constructions. The passive voice would be used on verbs related to the deceased. Example: The ded man's body was found near the river. = 死者的遗体在河边被发现。


疑问句:
"Ded" is not used in questions directly; questions would concern the person or thing that is dead. Example: Is your grandfather ded? =你的祖父去世了吗？


否定句:
The negation is applied to the subject's state, not to "ded" itself. Example: My cat is not ded, she's just sleeping. =我的猫没有死，它只是在睡觉。


虚拟语气:
(Same as above) Example: If my grandfather were still alive, he would be proud. =如果我的祖父还活着，他会很骄傲。（ded is implied, not directly used in the subjunctive phrasing）


被动语态:
(Same as above) Example: The ded man's body was found near the river. = 死者的遗体在河边被发现。


疑问句:
(Same as above) Example: Is your grandfather ded? =你的祖父去世了吗？


否定句:
(Same as above) Example: My cat is not ded, she's just sleeping. =我的猫没有死，它只是在睡觉。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "ded" as a core element.  Phrases would involve the dead person or object.  Examples would be indirect, like "in memoriam," or "the ded poet."
