dll:/ˌdiːˌɛlˈɛl/ | n. | 动态链接库 | A dynamic link library (DLL) is a type of file containing executable code and data that can be used by more than one program at the same time.  It's a crucial component of the Windows operating system and many other operating systems. DLLs allow programs to share resources, reducing memory usage and improving performance. They are typically loaded into memory when a program needs them, and then unloaded when they are no longer needed. | Example:  The program crashed because it couldn't find the necessary DLL files.  这个程序崩溃了，因为它找不到必要的DLL文件。 | 近义词：shared library (in other operating systems) | 反义词：None | 名词
