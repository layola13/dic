The word "proconsul" comes from the Latin words "pro" (meaning "in place of," "instead of," or "before") and "consul" (meaning "consul").  A proconsul was a Roman official who governed a province in the absence of, or in place of, a consul.  The "-'s" ending indicates the possessive case, showing ownership or belonging.
