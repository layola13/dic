词源:

The word "relief" comes from the Old French word "releef," meaning "raising up,"  which ultimately derives from the Latin word "relevare," meaning "to raise up," "to lift," or "to relieve."  The sense of "raising up" refers to the raised figures in relief sculpture.  The meaning extended to the sense of easing or alleviating suffering or hardship over time.
