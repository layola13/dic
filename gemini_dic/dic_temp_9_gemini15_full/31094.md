词源:
The word "champ" in this context comes from the Old French word "champaign," meaning "field" or "plain." The image of a horse eagerly chewing its bit while restrained in a field likely led to the development of the meaning "to chew noisily."  The addition of "-ing" creates the present participle, emphasizing the ongoing action of chewing.
