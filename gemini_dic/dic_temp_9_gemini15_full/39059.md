conformation's:/ˌkɒnfəˈmeɪʃənz/ | n. |构象；构造；确认；证实 |The arrangement of atoms in a molecule that can be changed by rotation about single bonds.  It refers to the three-dimensional structure of a molecule.  The term is often used in chemistry and biochemistry. |例句：The different conformations of cyclohexane were studied using NMR spectroscopy.  不同的环己烷构象通过核磁共振波谱进行了研究。

The police confirmed his confession, adding further weight to the conformation of the crime.警方证实了他的供词，进一步证实了犯罪的事实。|近义词：configuration, structure, shape, verification, confirmation |反义词：disproof, refutation, denial
