hydrogen-like: /ˈhaɪdrədʒənlaɪk/ | adj. | 类氢的；氢原子似的 |  Resembling a hydrogen atom in its electronic structure; having a single electron orbiting a nucleus.  This often refers to ions with only one electron, such as He⁺ or Li²⁺, which behave similarly to hydrogen atoms in terms of their spectral lines and energy levels. |


例句：

Helium ions are hydrogen-like because they have only one electron. = 氦离子是类氢的，因为它们只有一个电子。

The energy levels of hydrogen-like atoms can be calculated using a simple formula. = 类氢原子的能级可以用简单的公式计算。
