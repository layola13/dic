词源:

The word "fondle" comes from the Middle English word "fondelen," meaning "to touch gently or caress."  This, in turn, is likely related to the Old French word "fondre," meaning "to melt" or "to caress," and ultimately from the Latin word "fundere," meaning "to pour" or "to melt."  The original sense of gentle touching is still present, but the word has evolved to often carry a sexual or suggestive connotation in modern usage, especially when referring to inappropriate touching.
