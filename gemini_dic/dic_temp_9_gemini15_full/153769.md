peptides:/ˈpɛptaɪdz/| n. |肽，多肽|Short chains of amino acids, linked by peptide bonds. Peptides are smaller than proteins.  They play various roles in the body, including acting as hormones and neurotransmitters.|例句：Researchers are studying the effects of different peptides on cell growth. 研究人员正在研究不同肽对细胞生长的影响。|例句：Many hormones are peptides. 许多激素都是肽。|近义词：polypeptides|反义词：proteins (in terms of size and complexity)
