词源:
The word "rebelly" is derived from the adjective "rebellious," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "rebel," meaning "to revolt" or "to rise up against authority."  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverbial form, but in this case, it's used to create a stronger adjectival form emphasizing the characteristic of rebellion.
