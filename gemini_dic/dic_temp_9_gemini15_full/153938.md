词源:

The word "peremptory" comes from the Late Latin *peremptorius, from the Latin verb *perimere, meaning "to destroy," "to kill," or "to extinguish."  This reflects the sense of finality and conclusiveness associated with the word.  The related words "peremption" and "peremptorial" share this same etymology.
