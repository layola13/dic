词源:
The word "sacrifice" comes from the Late Middle English word "sacrifice," which in turn originates from the Old French word "sacrifice" and the Latin word "sacrificium."  The Latin word is a compound of "sacr-" (sacred) and "facere" (to make, to do), thus literally meaning "to make sacred" or "to make a sacred offering."  The original meaning involved the ritual offering of something to a deity.  Over time, the meaning broadened to include the act of giving up something valuable for a higher purpose.
