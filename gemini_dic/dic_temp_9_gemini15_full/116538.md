The word "mather" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word, such as "mother," "matter," or a less common word.  Please double-check the spelling.

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a slang term, or a word specific to a particular dialect or community.  More context is needed to understand its meaning.

3. **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a name or a place name.
