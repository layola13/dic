词源:

From Middle English *dignite, from Old French dignité, from Latin dignitas, from dignus "worthy," related to decēre "to seem fit, be suitable."  The Latin root ultimately connects to the Proto-Indo-European root *deig- "to lead, to guide," suggesting an original sense of being "fit to lead" or "worthy of respect."
