fumarole:/ˈfjuːməroʊl/| n. |喷气孔；火山喷气孔|A fumarole is a vent in a volcanic area from which hot gases emerge.  These gases can include water vapor, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, and other volcanic gases.  Fumaroles are often found near active volcanoes or in areas with recent volcanic activity. They can vary in size and temperature, from small, relatively cool vents to large, intensely hot jets. |The sulfurous fumes from the fumarole stung my eyes.  喷气孔里散发出的硫磺烟熏得我眼睛发疼。

The geothermal area is dotted with numerous fumaroles emitting steam and gases.  地热区布满了许多喷出蒸汽和气体的喷气孔。
