nonopacities: /ˌnɒnəʊˈpæsɪtiz/ | n. |  非不透明物；透明物质 | Areas or substances that lack opacity;  things that allow light to pass through. The term is primarily used in medical imaging, particularly radiology, to describe areas on an image that appear transparent or translucent, contrasting with opacities (areas that block light or x-rays). | Example: The chest X-ray showed several nonopacities indicating the absence of significant lung consolidation.  胸部X光片显示多个非不透明区，表明肺实变不明显。 | 近义词:translucencies, transparencies | 反义词: opacities


USAGE->
This word is primarily a technical term and doesn't lend itself to the full range of grammatical tenses and structures like "what."  The usage examples below focus on how it functions within medical contexts.

一般现在时:
The radiologist identifies nonopacities in the image.  = 放射科医生在图像中识别出非不透明区域。
Nonopacities are often indicative of healthy tissue. = 非不透明区域通常表示组织健康。


一般过去时:
The previous X-ray showed fewer nonopacities. =  之前的X光片显示较少的非不透明区域。
The doctor noted the presence of several nonopacities during the examination. = 医生在检查过程中注意到几个非不透明区域。


现在完成时:
Researchers have observed increased nonopacities in the treated group. = 研究人员在治疗组中观察到非不透明区域增加。
The patient has shown improved lung clarity, with fewer nonopacities. = 病人的肺部清晰度有所提高，非不透明区域减少。


过去完成时:
Before the treatment, the patient's lungs showed extensive opacities, but fewer nonopacities. = 治疗前，患者的肺部显示广泛的不透明区域，但非不透明区域较少。(This example highlights the contrast with opacities)
They had already identified the significant nonopacities in the earlier scans. = 他们在之前的扫描中已经识别出明显的非不透明区域。


将来时:
The scan will likely reveal more nonopacities after the procedure. = 手术后扫描可能会显示更多的非不透明区域。
We expect to see fewer nonopacities following the treatment. = 我们预计治疗后非不透明区域会减少。


被动语态:
Nonopacities were observed in the peripheral lung fields. = 在肺部周围区域观察到非不透明区域。
The presence of nonopacities is often misdiagnosed. = 非不透明区域的存在经常被误诊。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "nonopacities" due to its technical nature.  Phrases would be formed within medical reports or discussions, for example:

areas of nonopacity = 非不透明区域
presence of nonopacities = 非不透明区域的存在
increased nonopacities = 非不透明区域增多
distribution of nonopacities = 非不透明区域的分布
absence of significant nonopacities = 无明显非不透明区域
