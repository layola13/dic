reamassments:/ˌriːəˈmæsments/| n.|重新评估；重新测量|The word "reamassments" is not a standard English word.  It seems to be a neologism, likely formed by combining "re-" (again) and "assessments" (evaluations).  Therefore, its meaning is inferred from its components. It would refer to the act of reassessing or re-evaluating something, or possibly the act of remeasuring something. |例句：The committee will conduct reassignments to ensure fairness. (This uses a similar-sounding, correct word.  A potential example using the neologism would be: The project required several reassignments of resources and reamassments of the budget.)|近义词：reassessments, reevaluations, remeasurements|反义词：initial assessments, original measurements|名词
