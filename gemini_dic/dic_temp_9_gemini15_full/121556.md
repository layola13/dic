词源：
The word "mismeshing" is a relatively modern word, formed by combining the prefix "mis-" (meaning "wrongly" or "badly") with the noun "meshing" (referring to the act of fitting or interlocking).  The root of "mesh" comes from Old English *mascian, meaning "to make a net."  Thus, "mismeshing" literally means "fitting together wrongly" or "interlocking improperly."
