近义词：idioms, colloquialisms, expressions, turns of phrase | 反义词：literalness, formality


词源:  Derived from "idiomatic," meaning "peculiar to the language," which itself comes from "idiom," ultimately from Greek "ἴδιος" (idios) meaning "one's own, private, peculiar."  The suffix "-ities" forms a plural noun meaning "qualities or characteristics."  因此，idiomaticities 指的是语言中独特的、个体的、习惯性的表达方式的特性。
