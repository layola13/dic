词源:  The word is a compound of "gorilla" and the suffix "-like," meaning "resembling" or "characteristic of."  "Gorilla" itself originates from the Greek word "gorillai," which was used by Hanno the Navigator in his account of an expedition to West Africa in the 5th century BC to refer to a large, hairy creature. The exact species he encountered is debated, but it likely influenced the modern usage of the word.
