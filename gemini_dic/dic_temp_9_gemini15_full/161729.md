词源:

The term "power-sharing" is a relatively modern compound word, combining the noun "power" (from Old French *poer, from Latin potere "to be able") and the gerund "sharing" (from Old English *scērian "to share").  Its emergence reflects the growing importance of inclusive governance and conflict resolution strategies in the latter half of the 20th century and beyond.
