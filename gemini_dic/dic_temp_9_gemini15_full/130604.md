英文解析:  Nonadeptnesses is a relatively rare word formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the noun "adeptnesses," which itself is the plural of "adeptness."  It refers to a lack of skill, proficiency, or expertise in multiple areas or aspects.  It highlights a multifaceted incompetence rather than a single deficiency.


例句：
