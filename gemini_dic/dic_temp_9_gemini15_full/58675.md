词源:  The word "dummy" comes from the Middle English word "dummie," meaning "mute" or "dumb." This, in turn, is related to the Old English word "dumb," meaning the same. Over time, its meaning broadened to include inanimate representations of people and, eventually, to refer to something that is not real or a substitute.
