non-stationary: /ˌnɒnˈsteɪʃənəri/ | adj. |非平稳的，不稳定的|

英文解析:Not remaining in one place; constantly moving or changing.  Describing a process or system whose statistical properties, such as mean and variance, change over time.  In time series analysis, a non-stationary time series shows trends, seasonality, or other patterns that are not consistent over time.

例句:
The stock market is a non-stationary process; its behavior changes constantly. = 股市是一个非平稳的过程；它的行为不断变化。

The river's flow is non-stationary due to seasonal rainfall variations. = 由于季节性降雨变化，河流的流量是不稳定的。


近义词:unstable, fluctuating, variable, dynamic, unsteady

反义词:stationary, stable, constant, unchanging, static


词源:
* **non-**:  prefix meaning "not"
* **stationary**: from Latin *stationarius* ("belonging to a station"), from *statio* ("a standing, position").  This root also gives us words like "station," "state," and "status."


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a descriptive context and doesn't typically inflect through tenses.  Its usage is mostly in academic or technical settings, particularly in statistics, economics, and time series analysis.  Therefore, a traditional tense breakdown is not applicable. However, we can show examples of how it's used in different sentence structures:


肯定句:
The data shows a non-stationary pattern. = 数据显示出非平稳的模式。
The economic model assumes non-stationary time series. = 经济模型假设非平稳的时间序列。


否定句:
The time series is not non-stationary; it's stationary. = 该时间序列不是非平稳的；它是平稳的。
The results were not influenced by non-stationary behavior. = 结果不受非平稳行为的影响。


疑问句:
Is the process non-stationary? = 这个过程是非平稳的吗？
Are the data non-stationary? = 数据是非平稳的吗？


PHRASE->
There aren't common idiomatic phrases directly using "non-stationary."  Its use is primarily within technical contexts, not colloquial language. However, we can show it in phrases related to its meaning:

Non-stationary time series analysis = 非平稳时间序列分析
Exhibiting non-stationary behavior = 表现出非平稳的行为
Testing for non-stationarity = 测试非平稳性
Non-stationary stochastic process = 非平稳随机过程
Model of non-stationary data = 非平稳数据模型
