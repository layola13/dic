nonfermentable: /ˌnɒnfərˈmɛntəbəl/ | adj. | 不可发酵的 | Not capable of being fermented.  This term usually refers to substances that cannot be broken down by microorganisms (such as bacteria or yeast) into simpler compounds through fermentation.  | Example:  The nonfermentable sugars passed through the digestive system undigested.  不可发酵的糖类未经消化就通过了消化系统。 | 近义词: unfermentable, non-fermentable | 反义词: fermentable


USAGE->
一般现在时:
This substance is nonfermentable. = 这种物质是不可发酵的。
The bacteria cannot ferment this sugar. = 细菌无法发酵这种糖。


一般过去时:
The test showed the sample was nonfermentable. = 测试显示样品不可发酵。
The yeast did not ferment the solution. = 酵母菌没有发酵该溶液。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several nonfermentable carbohydrates. = 科学家们已经鉴定了几种不可发酵的碳水化合物。
Researchers have found that this compound is nonfermentable. = 研究人员发现这种化合物是不可发酵的。


过去完成时:
They had already determined that the substance was nonfermentable before the experiment. = 他们在实验之前就已经确定该物质是不可发酵的。
The analysis had shown that the sugars were nonfermentable. = 分析表明这些糖是不可发酵的。


将来时:
We will test if the new compound is nonfermentable. = 我们将测试新化合物是否不可发酵。
The lab will determine whether the sample is fermentable or nonfermentable. = 实验室将确定样品是可发酵的还是不可发酵的。


虚拟语气:
If the substance were nonfermentable, it would not produce gas. = 如果这种物质不可发酵，它就不会产生气体。
I wish I had known the substance was nonfermentable earlier. = 我希望我早点知道这种物质是不可发酵的。


被动语态:
The nonfermentable sugars were not metabolized by the bacteria. = 细菌没有代谢不可发酵的糖类。
It was determined that the sample was nonfermentable. = 确定样品不可发酵。


疑问句:
Is this sugar nonfermentable? = 这种糖是不可发酵的吗？
Are there any nonfermentable substances in this mixture? = 这个混合物中是否有任何不可发酵的物质？


否定句:
This is not a nonfermentable substance; it ferments readily. = 这不是不可发酵的物质；它很容易发酵。
The bacteria were able to ferment the sugar; it was not nonfermentable. = 细菌能够发酵这种糖；它不是不可发酵的。
