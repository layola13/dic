词源:
The verb "mull" in this phrase comes from the Old English word "myllan," meaning "to grind or crush."  Over time, the meaning evolved to include the idea of thoroughly mixing or blending, and eventually to ponder or reflect deeply.  The "over" adds emphasis to the thoroughness of the consideration.
