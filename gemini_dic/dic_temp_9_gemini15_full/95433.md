The word "incing" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or term used within a specific community or context. If this is the case, please provide more context about where you encountered this word.
* **It's a technical term:** It might be a specialized term used in a particular field (e.g., a scientific or technical discipline).  Again, providing context would be helpful.

Please provide more information so I can assist you properly.
