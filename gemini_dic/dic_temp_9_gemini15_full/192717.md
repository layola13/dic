/ɛsˈdiːɑːr/| n.|软件定义无线电|Software Defined Radio; a radio communication system where components that were traditionally implemented in hardware (such as modulation, demodulation, channel selection, encoding, decoding, etc.) are instead implemented using software on a general-purpose processor.  This allows for flexibility and adaptability, enabling the radio to be reconfigured for different communication standards and protocols without needing hardware changes.|Example: The SDR platform allowed us to quickly adapt to the changing communication needs of the mission.  软件定义无线电平台使我们能够快速适应任务变化的通信需求。|近义词：software radio|反义词：hardware radio
