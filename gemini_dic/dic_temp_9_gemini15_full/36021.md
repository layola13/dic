词源:
The word "cotillion" comes from the French word "cotillon," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "cotille," meaning "a little skirt," or "petticoat". This refers to the swirling skirts of the women dancing the cotillion.  The dance itself originated in France and later became popular in other European countries and the United States.
