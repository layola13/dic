词源:

The term "mindblown" is a relatively recent addition to the English lexicon, originating in the late 20th or early 21st century. It's a figurative expression, combining the noun "mind" with the past participle "blown," implying that the mind has been figuratively "blown away" by something extraordinary or shocking. The use of "blown" here draws a parallel to the effect of a strong wind, suggesting a sudden and powerful impact on one's thoughts and perceptions.  Its rise in popularity is largely attributed to its use in online forums and social media.
