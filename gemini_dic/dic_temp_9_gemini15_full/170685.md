pseudoaesthetic: /ˌsjuːdoʊɛsˈθɛtɪk/ | adj. |伪美的，貌似美的 |  Relating to or characterized by a superficial or false appearance of beauty or artistic merit;  pretending to be beautiful or artistic but lacking genuine aesthetic value.  It often implies a cheap imitation or a deliberate attempt to appear sophisticated without substance.


英文解析: The term combines "pseudo" (meaning false or pretended) with "aesthetic" (relating to beauty or art).  Therefore, it describes something that merely imitates or superficially resembles aesthetic qualities without possessing genuine artistic merit or beauty.
