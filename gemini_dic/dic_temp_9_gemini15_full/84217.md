词源:
The word "half-rueful" is a compound word.  "Half" is from Old English *healf, meaning "half," and "rueful" comes from the Middle English *rewful, derived from Old French *rueful and ultimately from the Latin *ruere, meaning "to fall, to rush, to ruin."  The sense of regret and sorrow evolved from the idea of something falling or being ruined.
