词源:
The word "pocketknife" is a compound word, combining "pocket" (a small bag or pouch for carrying things) and "knife" (a cutting instrument).  Its meaning is straightforward; it's a knife small enough to fit in a pocket.  The etymology of "knife" traces back to Old English *cnīf, and ultimately to Proto-Germanic and Proto-Indo-European roots.
