词源:

The word "perpendicularly" derives from the adjective "perpendicular," which in turn comes from the Late Latin word "perpendicularis," meaning "plumb, upright."  This word itself is a combination of "perpendiculum" (a plumb line) and the suffix "-aris," indicating an adjective.  The "perpendiculum" derives from "pendere," meaning "to hang," indicating the vertical orientation implied by a plumb line.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective "perpendicular" into an adverb, signifying the manner or way in which something is perpendicular.
