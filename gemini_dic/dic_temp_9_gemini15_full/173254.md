quasi-connective:/ˈkwɑːzaɪkəˈnɛktɪv/ | adj. |准连接词的，类似连接词的 |  Describes words or phrases that function in a way similar to conjunctions, but do not strictly fit the grammatical definition of a conjunction.  They often link clauses or sentences, showing a relationship between them, but may lack the formal properties of coordinating or subordinating conjunctions.  Examples include words like "however," "therefore," "consequently," and "moreover," which connect ideas but don't always adhere to the strict grammatical rules of conjunctions. | Example: "The experiment failed; however, we learned valuable lessons." (Here, "however" connects two independent clauses but isn't a coordinating conjunction like "and" or "but".)  | 近义词: connective, linking, transitional | 反义词:  disjunctive (in the sense of separating rather than connecting) |  adj.


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in linguistic analysis and discussions of grammar.  There aren't common tense variations or typical sentence structures associated with "quasi-connective" itself, as it describes a grammatical function rather than a verb or noun.  Example sentences would focus on illustrating the *use* of quasi-connectives.


Example 1 (Illustrating the function):
"The rain was heavy; consequently, the game was cancelled." = 雨很大；因此，比赛取消了。

Example 2 (Contrasting with a true conjunction):
"The sun was shining, and the birds were singing."  = 太阳照耀着，鸟儿在唱歌。( 'and' is a true coordinating conjunction)


PHRASE->
