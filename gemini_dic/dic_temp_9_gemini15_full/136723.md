词源:

* **nonsense:**  This is the root word, meaning something that is meaningless or absurd. It comes from the Old English "non" (not) + "sense" (meaning).

* **-ness:** This suffix is added to adjectives to form nouns that denote a state, quality, or condition.  For example, "good" becomes "goodness."


用法说明:

Nonsensibleness is a noun that describes the quality or state of being nonsensical.  It indicates a lack of sense, meaning, or logic. It's often used to describe ideas, arguments, or actions that are illogical, absurd, or foolish.  The word carries a stronger connotation of inherent lack of logic than simply "silliness".  It implies a deeper flaw in reasoning or understanding.
