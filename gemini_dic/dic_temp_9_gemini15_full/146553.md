词源:  The word "overgorge" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "gorge," which originally meant to stuff or fill to excess, particularly with food.  "Gorge" itself comes from the Old French word "gorger," meaning "to swallow," ultimately deriving from the Latin "gurges," meaning "whirlpool" or "gulf," reflecting the idea of something being swallowed up or engulfed.
