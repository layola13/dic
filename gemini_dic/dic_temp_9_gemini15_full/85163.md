词源:  The word "hardwired" combines "hard" (firm, fixed, solid) and "wired" (connected by wires, referring to electrical connections).  The original meaning referred to physical electrical connections, but the metaphorical usage extended to describe ingrained behaviors, traits, or characteristics.  The "wired" part comes from the Old English word *wīr, meaning wire.
