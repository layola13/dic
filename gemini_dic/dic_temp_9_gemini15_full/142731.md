词源:
The word "otolaryngologists" is derived from three Greek words:
* **oto-**: ear (from Greek οὖς, oûs)
* **laryngo-**: larynx (from Greek λάρυγξ, lárynx)
* **-ology**: the study of (from Greek -λογία, -logia)
The suffix "-ist" indicates a person who practices a particular profession or skill.  Therefore, otolaryngologist literally means "one who studies the ear, larynx, and related structures."
