USAGE->
This word is primarily used in linguistic analysis and doesn't have typical grammatical tenses or voice changes like verbs. Its usage revolves around explaining word formation.  Therefore, providing examples across tenses and voices is not applicable.


Example 1:  The word "underrated" demonstrates an infix structure. The root "rate" is surrounded by the prefixes "un-" and "-ed".  While "un-" and "-ed" are prefixes and suffixes respectively, the word as a whole exhibits infixation as a morphological process.


Example 2: In some languages, infixes are used to indicate tense or aspect. For example, a hypothetical language might use an infix to mark the past tense.  If the root word is "walk", adding an infix "-ed-" might create "w-ed-alk" to indicate past tense. This is a purely illustrative example.


PHRASE->
The term "infix" itself doesn't readily form common phrases.  Its usage is primarily within grammatical and linguistic discussions.  Phrases involving its application would require a specific linguistic context.
