colloidal:/kəˈlɔɪdəl/| adj.|胶体的；胶状的| Relating to or denoting a substance in which extremely fine particles are suspended in a fluid, forming a colloidal system.  A colloidal system is a mixture of two or more substances, where one substance is dispersed as very fine particles (the dispersed phase) throughout another substance (the continuous phase). These particles are larger than those in a solution but smaller than those in a suspension, typically ranging from 1 to 1000 nanometers in diameter.  The particles do not settle out of the fluid easily. | Example: Milk is a colloidal solution of fat globules in water.  牛奶是脂肪球在水中的胶体溶液。|近义词：colloid, dispersed|反义词：homogeneous, solution


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The milk is a colloidal suspension. = 牛奶是一种胶体悬浮液。
This solution exhibits colloidal properties. = 此溶液表现出胶体特性。


一般过去时:
The scientist studied colloidal systems. = 科学家研究了胶体系统。
The mixture formed a colloidal gel. = 混合物形成了胶状凝胶。


现在完成时:
Researchers have discovered new applications of colloids. = 研究人员已经发现了胶体的新的应用。
We have observed colloidal stability under various conditions. = 我们在各种条件下观察到胶体的稳定性。


过去完成时:
They had already prepared the colloidal gold before the experiment. = 他们在实验前已经制备好了胶体金。
The students had studied colloidal chemistry in the previous semester. = 学生们在上个学期学习了胶体化学。


将来时:
We will analyze the colloidal behavior of the nanoparticles. = 我们将分析纳米粒子的胶体行为。
Scientists will further investigate the properties of colloids. = 科学家们将进一步研究胶体的性质。


虚拟语气:
If the particles were smaller, it would be a true solution, not a colloid. = 如果粒子更小，它将是真正的溶液，而不是胶体。
I wish I had understood colloidal chemistry better. = 我希望我更好地理解胶体化学。


被动语态:
The colloidal particles were observed under a microscope. = 胶体粒子在显微镜下被观察到。
The stability of the colloid was affected by the temperature. = 胶体的稳定性受到温度的影响。


疑问句:
Is this a colloidal dispersion or a suspension? = 这是胶体分散还是悬浮液？
What are the factors affecting colloidal stability? = 影响胶体稳定性的因素有哪些？


否定句:
This is not a colloidal solution; it's a true solution. = 这不是胶体溶液；它是真正的溶液。
The mixture did not exhibit typical colloidal behavior. = 该混合物没有表现出典型的胶体行为。


PHRASE->
colloidal gold: 胶体金
colloidal silver: 胶体银
colloidal dispersion: 胶体分散
colloidal solution: 胶体溶液
colloidal system: 胶体系统
