The word "cabalas" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word, perhaps related to "cabal."  If so, please provide the intended word or context.

2. **A proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (name of a person, place, or thing) not found in standard dictionaries.  Again, context is needed.

3. **A neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.

4. **A word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language that hasn't been widely adopted into English.


Without more information, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested in the format.  Please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
