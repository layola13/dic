词源:

The word "scurvy" (and hence "scurvier") ultimately derives from the Middle English word "scurvy," which itself comes from the Old Norse word "skyrbjǫr," meaning "a kind of sour milk."  This connection is due to the association of the disease with the consumption of spoiled food and the resulting poor diet.  Over time, the meaning shifted from a general term for something foul or bad to specifically refer to the disease, and then to associated negative qualities.
