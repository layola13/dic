词源:
The word "gunsmith" is a compound word combining "gun" and "smith."  "Gun" comes from Old French "gonne," referring to a cannon or large firearm. "Smith" comes from Old English "smiþ," meaning a skilled worker, particularly one who works with metal.  Therefore, a gunsmith is literally a skilled worker who works with guns.
