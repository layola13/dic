词源:
The word "judge" originates from the Old French word "juger,"  itself derived from the Latin word "iūdicāre," meaning "to judge, to pronounce judgment."  The Latin word is formed from "iūdex," meaning "judge," which combines "ius" (right, law) and "dicere" (to say, to speak).  Therefore, the core meaning of "judge" has always been related to the legal and authoritative assessment of something.
