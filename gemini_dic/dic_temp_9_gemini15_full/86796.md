The word "hemaphaein" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical examples as requested.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  A slight alteration might reveal a valid word.
2. **It's a neologism or technical term:** It might be a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field (e.g., medicine, technology). If you can provide context where you encountered this word, it might help in identifying its meaning.
3. **It's from a different language:** The word might originate from another language.  Providing the language's origin would help in finding a translation and explanation.

Please provide more information to help me understand the word and give you the analysis you need.
