词源:  Derived from the adjective "prone," meaning "likely to," "inclined to," or "lying flat."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun indicating a state or quality.  Ultimately, it traces back to the Old English word "prōn," meaning "bent," "inclined," or "leaning."


用法说明:  "Pronenesses" is used to describe multiple inherent qualities or characteristics that make someone or something susceptible to a particular condition, behavior, or event.  It emphasizes the existence of several such qualities rather than just one.  The word is less common than "proneness," but it is grammatically correct and useful when referring to multiple tendencies.  It is often used in formal or academic contexts.
