词源:
The word "chartreuse" derives from the French word for the Carthusian order of monks, "Chartreuse."  The Carthusian monks of the Grande Chartreuse monastery in the French Alps were famous for producing a liqueur of the same name, which had a distinctive yellowish-green hue. This distinctive color eventually became associated with the name, leading to its use as a color term.
