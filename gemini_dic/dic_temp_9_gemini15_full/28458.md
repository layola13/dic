carburise:/ˈkɑːrbəraɪz/| vt.|渗碳；使…含碳|To impregnate (iron or steel) with carbon, typically by heating it in the presence of a carbon-containing substance, to increase its hardness.  This process is used to harden the surface of steel parts while maintaining a softer core. |例句：The steel components were carburised to improve their wear resistance. = 钢铁部件经过渗碳处理以提高其耐磨性。

The gears were carburised before being heat-treated. = 齿轮在热处理前进行了渗碳处理。


近义词：case-harden, cement|反义词：decarburize
