gibbsite:/ˈɡɪbsaɪt/| n. |三水铝石|Gibbsite is a mineral consisting of aluminum hydroxide, Al(OH)₃.  It is a major source of aluminum ore and is often found in bauxite.  Its structure is layered, with the layers held together by weak hydrogen bonds, making it relatively soft. |The gibbsite in this sample shows clear crystal habit. 这个样本中的三水铝石显示出清晰的晶体习性。|近义词：hydrargillite (an older, less common name)|反义词：无|名词
