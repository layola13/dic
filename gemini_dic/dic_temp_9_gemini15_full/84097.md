词源:

* **half-:**  This prefix means "partly" or "to a certain extent."  It comes from Old English *healf*.

* **instinctive:** This word derives from "instinct," which comes from the Latin *instinctus*, the past participle of *instingere*, meaning "to prick, to urge on."  It refers to behavior that is innate and not learned.

* **-ly:** This suffix turns adjectives into adverbs, indicating manner or way.


用法说明:

This adverb describes an action performed not entirely consciously, but with a partial element of instinct or innate behavior.  It suggests a mixture of deliberate action and automatic response.  The "half" emphasizes the incomplete or partial nature of the instinctive element.  The action is not fully reasoned or planned, but neither is it a completely involuntary reflex.
