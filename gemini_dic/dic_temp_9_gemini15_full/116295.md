USAGE->
This word is a possessive form, and therefore doesn't follow typical verb tenses.  It describes the possession of massiveness.  Usage examples focus on how the possessive functions in a sentence.

PHRASE->
Because "massiveness's" is a possessive form, phrases are built around it, not with it as a core element.  Therefore, standard phrases cannot be constructed using this word.


词源:

The word "massiveness's" is derived from:

* **massive:**  From Old French *massif*, from *masse* "mass, lump," from Vulgar Latin *massa*, from Greek *μάζα* (máza) "lump, mass, dough."

* **-ness:** This suffix is a common English suffix that turns adjectives into nouns, denoting a state, quality, or condition.  In this case it creates "massiveness" meaning the state or quality of being massive.

* **-'s:** This is the possessive apostrophe-s, indicating that the massiveness belongs to something else.


注意:  "Massiveness's" is grammatically correct but relatively uncommon.  It's more natural to say "the massiveness of the structure" or to express the idea using synonyms.
