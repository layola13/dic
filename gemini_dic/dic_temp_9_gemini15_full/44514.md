They are characterized by their fleshy, lobed fins, which are believed to have been crucial in the evolution of tetrapods (four-limbed vertebrates).  |The discovery of living coelacanths was a major event in zoology, demonstrating that crossopterygians had survived the presumed extinction event that wiped out the other members of this group millions of years ago.|近义词:lobe-finned fishes|反义词:N/A|名词
