词源:

The word "mercilessnesses" is derived from the adjective "merciless," which itself combines:

* **merciless:**  "mercy" + "-less".  "Mercy" comes from Old French "merci" (meaning "thanks," then developing into the sense of "compassion") ultimately from Latin *mercedem* (reward, wages, grace). "-less" is a suffix indicating absence or lack of something.


Therefore, "mercilessnesses" signifies the plural state of instances lacking mercy or compassion, embodying cruelty and inhumanity.
