词源:

The word "incognizant" comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "cognizant," which derives from the Latin word "cognoscere" meaning "to know" or "to learn."  Therefore, "incognizant" literally means "not knowing."


用法说明:

Incognizant is primarily used as an adjective to describe someone who is unaware of something, typically something important or relevant.  It implies a lack of knowledge or perception, often due to negligence or unawareness, rather than deliberate ignorance.  It is a less common word than "unaware" or "ignorant," and often has a more formal tone.
