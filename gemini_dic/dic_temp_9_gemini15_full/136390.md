nonrestrictions:/ˌnɒnˌrɪˈstrɪkʃənz/| n. |非限制性条款；非限制性规定|Nonrestrictions refer to clauses or phrases that add extra information to a sentence but are not essential to its grammatical structure.  They are usually set off by commas, dashes, or parentheses. Unlike restrictive clauses, which are necessary to identify the noun they modify, nonrestrictive clauses provide additional, non-essential details.|Example: My brother, who lives in London, is a doctor. (The clause "who lives in London" is nonrestrictive because it adds information about the brother but doesn't define which brother is being discussed.)|近义词：additional information, supplementary details|反义词：restrictions, limitations
