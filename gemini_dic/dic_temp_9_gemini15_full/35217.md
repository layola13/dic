词源:

The word "cluding" originates from the Latin word "cludere," meaning "to close" or "to shut."  The prefix "con-" intensifies the meaning, suggesting a thorough or complete closing. The "-ing" suffix transforms the verb into a present participle, which can function as a noun (gerund) or an adjective.


用法说明：

1. **As a noun (gerund):**  "The concluding remarks were insightful." (Here, "concluding" acts as a noun modifying "remarks.")

2. **As an adjective:** "The concluding chapter left the reader wanting more." (Here, "concluding" modifies the noun "chapter.")

3. **As part of a verb phrase:**  "The meeting is concluding now." (Here, "concluding" is part of the progressive verb tense.)


需要注意的是，"cluding" itself is not typically used as a standalone word. It's usually found as part of a phrase like "including," "concluding," or "excluding."  The word "concluding" is far more common in usage than "cluding" alone.
