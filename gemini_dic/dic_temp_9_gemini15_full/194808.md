semaphores:/ˈsɛməˌfɔrz/| n. |信号灯；信号；信号机制 |Semaphores are signaling mechanisms used to control access to shared resources in a concurrent system.  They prevent race conditions and ensure that multiple processes or threads can access shared data without causing conflicts.  A semaphore is essentially a counter that can be incremented (signaled) and decremented (waited on).  When a process needs access to a shared resource, it waits on the semaphore. If the counter is greater than zero, the process proceeds. If the counter is zero, the process blocks until another process signals the semaphore (increments the counter).|Example:  The operating system uses semaphores to manage access to the printer. If the printer is busy, a semaphore will prevent other processes from sending print jobs until the printer becomes free.  The programmer implemented semaphores to synchronize the access of multiple threads to a shared database.|近义词：signal, flag |反义词：无


USAGE->
(Semaphores are a programming concept, not a verb that conjugates in the typical way.  Therefore, grammatical tenses do not apply directly.  The usage examples below demonstrate how semaphores are *used* within different programming contexts.)

Example 1 (Using semaphores for mutual exclusion):
A semaphore is initialized to 1.  Multiple threads attempt to acquire the semaphore. Only one thread can acquire it, thus achieving mutual exclusion.  After the thread is finished using the resource, it releases the semaphore. = 一个信号量初始化为1。多个线程尝试获取信号量。只有一个线程可以获取它，从而实现互斥。线程完成使用资源后，它释放信号量。


Example 2 (Using semaphores for synchronization):
Two threads, a producer and a consumer, share a buffer. The producer uses a semaphore to signal the consumer that data is available. The consumer uses a semaphore to signal the producer that the buffer is empty and ready for more data. = 两个线程，一个生产者和一个消费者，共享一个缓冲区。生产者使用信号量来向消费者发出数据可用的信号。消费者使用信号量来向生产者发出缓冲区为空且已准备好更多数据的信号。



PHRASE->
binary semaphore: 二元信号量
counting semaphore: 计数信号量
mutex semaphore:互斥信号量
semaphore wait: 信号量等待
semaphore signal: 信号量信号
