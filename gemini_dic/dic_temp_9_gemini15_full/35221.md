词源:
The term "clued-up" is a relatively recent addition to the English language, originating in British English slang.  The "clue" element refers to having pieces of information, and "up" suggests being fully informed or in possession of all the relevant clues.  The exact origin and date of its first usage are difficult to pinpoint but it likely developed in the mid-20th century.
