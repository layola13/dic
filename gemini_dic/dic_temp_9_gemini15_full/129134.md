no-ball:/ˈnoʊbɔːl/| n.|坏球，无效球|A no-ball is a delivery in cricket that is deemed illegal according to the Laws of Cricket and is thus not counted as a valid ball.  This usually happens because the bowler violates the rules, such as overstepping the crease or bowling a throw rather than a legitimate delivery.|Example: The umpire called a no-ball because the bowler overstepped the crease.  裁判员判罚坏球，因为投球手越过了投球线。  The batsman hit a six off a no-ball, earning an extra run.  击球手击中了一个坏球的六分，额外获得一分。|近义词：illegal delivery, foul ball (in other sports)|反义词：fair ball, legal delivery
