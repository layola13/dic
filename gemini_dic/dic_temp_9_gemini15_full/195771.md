semivowel:/ˈsemiˌvaʊəl/| n. |半元音|A semivowel is a sound that is phonetically similar to a vowel but functions as a consonant.  It is also called a glide. Semivowels are produced with less constriction of the vocal tract than stops or fricatives, but more constriction than vowels. They typically occur as the onset or coda of a syllable, unlike vowels, which usually form the nucleus of a syllable.| Example: The sounds /j/ (as in "yes") and /w/ (as in "wet") are considered semivowels. In the word "yes," /j/ acts as the onset, while in "wet," /w/ also serves as the onset. The sound /r/ (as in "red") is also often classified as a semivowel in many languages.|近义词：glide|反义词：vowel (in terms of function within a syllable)|n.
