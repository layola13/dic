词源:

The word "expectative" derives from the verb "expect," which comes from the Latin word "exspectare," a compound of "ex" (out) and "spectare" (to look, to watch).  Therefore, the original meaning was to "look out for" or "await."  The suffix "-ative" transforms the verb into an adjective, describing something characterized by expectation.
