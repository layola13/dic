词源:
The word "outreckoned" is formed by combining the prefix "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent than") with the past participle of the verb "reckon" (meaning "to calculate," "to estimate," or "to consider").  Therefore, it literally means "to calculate or estimate to a greater extent than."  The root "reckon" has Old Norse origins.
