词源:
From French *léthargique*, from Late Latin *lethargicus*, from Greek *lēthargikos*, from *lēthargos* ("forgetfulness, oblivion; lethargy").  The Greek word ultimately derives from *lānthanein* ("to lie hidden, escape notice").  The connection lies in the association of lethargy with a state of being seemingly unaware or unresponsive.
