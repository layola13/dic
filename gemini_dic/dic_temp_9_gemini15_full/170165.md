protophyll:/ˈproʊtoʊfɪl/| n. |原叶，原始叶|A protophyll is a small, simple leaf that develops early in the life of a plant, often differing significantly in shape and structure from the mature leaves.  They are typically scale-like or rudimentary and may not have a fully developed lamina or vascular system.|例句：The seedling exhibited several protophylls before developing its characteristic adult leaves.  幼苗在长出其特征性的成叶之前，先长出了一些原叶。|近义词：primordial leaf, juvenile leaf|反义词：mature leaf


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The seedling displays several protophylls. = 幼苗显示出几片原叶。
Protophylls are usually simple in structure. = 原叶通常结构简单。

一般过去时:
The researcher observed protophylls on the young plant. = 研究人员观察到幼苗上的原叶。
The early leaves were identified as protophylls. = 早期的叶子被鉴定为原叶。

现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the development of protophylls extensively. = 科学家们已经广泛研究了原叶的发育。
Botanists have documented various protophyll morphologies. = 植物学家们已经记录了各种原叶的形态。

过去完成时:
The plant had already produced several protophylls before flowering. = 植物在开花之前已经长出了几片原叶。
Researchers had hypothesized that protophylls played a specific role in early development. = 研究人员曾假设原叶在早期发育中扮演着特定角色。

将来时:
Further research will investigate the genetic control of protophyll development. = 后续研究将调查原叶发育的基因控制。
Scientists will analyze the function of protophylls in different plant species. = 科学家们将分析原叶在不同植物物种中的功能。

虚拟语气:
If the plant lacked protophylls, its development might be affected. = 如果植物缺乏原叶，它的发育可能会受到影响。
It is hypothesized that if protophylls were absent, the plant would not survive. = 假设如果原叶不存在，植物将无法存活。

被动语态:
Protophylls are often overlooked in plant studies. = 原叶在植物研究中经常被忽视。
The development of protophylls is influenced by environmental factors. = 原叶的发育受环境因素的影响。

疑问句:
What is the function of protophylls in early plant growth? = 原叶在植物早期生长中的作用是什么？
Do all plant species produce protophylls? = 所有植物物种都会产生原叶吗？

否定句:
These leaves are not protophylls; they are true leaves. = 这些叶子不是原叶；它们是真叶。
The plant did not develop typical protophylls during its early stages. = 植物在其早期阶段没有发育出典型的原叶。
