词源:
The term "sit-down" is a compound word formed from the verb "sit" and the adverb "down."  It's a descriptive phrase that literally means "to sit down," but it has evolved to describe specific events and actions. The usage of "sit-down" to describe protests originated in the 20th century, particularly during labor disputes.
