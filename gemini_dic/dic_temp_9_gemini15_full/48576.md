词源:  From Latin *dēfēnsībilis, from dēfendere "to defend," ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European root *dʰeh₁- "to put," "to place." The sense shift from "defensible" to "capable of being defeated or annulled" reflects a change in perspective: what was once defended can be later shown to be wrong or invalid.
