Fraunhofer:/ˈfraʊnˌhoʊfər/| n. |夫琅禾费|A Fraunhofer line is a dark line in an otherwise continuous spectrum, caused by the absorption of light at specific wavelengths by the elements in the sun's atmosphere.  Fraunhofer lines are named after Joseph von Fraunhofer, a German physicist who first systematically studied and catalogued them.  The term can also refer to the Fraunhofer diffraction, a phenomenon describing the interference patterns created by light waves bending around obstacles. | Example:  The dark lines in the solar spectrum are known as Fraunhofer lines.  夫琅禾费线是太阳光谱中的暗线。|近义词: diffraction pattern (in the context of diffraction)|反义词: N/A
