词源:

The word "convolutedly" is derived from the adjective "convoluted," which comes from the Latin word "convolutus," meaning "rolled together,"  "wrapped up," or "twisted."  The prefix "con-" means "together," and "volutus" is the past participle of "volvere," meaning "to roll."  Therefore, the original sense was of something being rolled or twisted together, leading to the current meaning of complex and intricate.


用法说明:

"Convolutedly" is an adverb used to describe how something is done or expressed. It emphasizes the complexity and difficulty of understanding something due to its intricate or roundabout nature.  It often implies excessive detail or a lack of clarity in expression.  Avoid using it when simple language would suffice.
