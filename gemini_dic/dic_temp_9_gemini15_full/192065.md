The word "scottering" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a very rare, regional, or dialectal term.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis following your requested format.  To help you, I need clarification:

* **Did you perhaps mean a different word?**  Could you double-check the spelling or provide more context where you encountered this word?  Perhaps it's a combination of words or a creative neologism.

* **What is the intended meaning?** Knowing the intended meaning will help determine the correct spelling and provide a proper analysis.


If you can provide more information, I will be happy to assist.
