interestedness's:/ˈɪntrəstɪdnəsɪz/| n. |兴趣（的）；关注（的）|The word "interestedness's" is grammatically incorrect.  It's a possessive form applied to an already existing noun ending in 's', creating an awkward and unnecessary construction.  The correct form would be either "interestedness" or a rephrasing of the sentence to avoid the double possessive.  Interestedness refers to the state or quality of being interested.  It describes the level of engagement or curiosity someone has. |例句：Her interestedness in the project was evident in her tireless work.  (她的兴趣在项目中显而易见，体现在她不知疲倦的工作上。)  The professor noted the students' interestedness in the topic. (教授注意到学生们对这个话题的兴趣。)|近义词：engagement, involvement, curiosity, enthusiasm |反义词：apathy, indifference, boredom |名词
