pretortures: /ˌpriːˈtɔːrˌtʃʊrz/ | n. | 预先折磨；事先拷打 |  The word "pretortures" is not a standard English word found in reputable dictionaries. It seems to be a neologism, likely formed by combining "pre-" (meaning "before") and "tortures" (the act of inflicting severe pain).  It implies the infliction of torture before some other event or action.  The meaning relies heavily on context. There is no standard usage, and its meaning is derived from its components.  Since it's not a recognized word, there are no standard synonyms or antonyms, and grammatical usage examples would be contrived.
