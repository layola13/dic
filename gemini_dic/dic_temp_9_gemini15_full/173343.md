词源：

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," "almost," or "somewhat."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation, not a complete or perfect equivalence.

* **desperately**: From "desperate," which comes from the Old French *desesperer*, meaning "to lose hope."  This in turn comes from the Latin *desperare*, composed of *de-* (away from) + *sperare* (to hope).
