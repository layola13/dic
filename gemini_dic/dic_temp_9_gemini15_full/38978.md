词源:
The word "confiner" is derived from the verb "confine," which comes from the Old French word "confine" meaning "boundary, limit."  The Old French word itself ultimately derives from the Latin word "finis," meaning "end, limit, boundary."  The prefix "con-" adds the sense of "together" or "completely," thus giving "confine" its meaning of restricting or enclosing completely.
