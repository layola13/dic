neopallium: /ˌniːoʊˈpæliəm/ | n. | 新皮质 | The neopallium is the most recently evolved part of the mammalian cerebral cortex, responsible for higher-level cognitive functions.  It's characterized by its layered structure and extensive interconnectivity.  The neocortex is often used interchangeably with neopallium, although technically the neocortex is slightly broader term encompassing the neopallium and some related structures. | Example: Studies on the neopallium of primates have revealed much about the neural basis of intelligence.  研究灵长类动物的新皮质揭示了智力的神经基础。


The neopallium is a highly developed part of the brain, responsible for complex cognitive functions.  Damage to the neopallium can result in significant cognitive impairments.  对新皮质的损伤可能导致严重的认知障碍。| 近义词: neocortex | 反义词:  archipallium (paleocortex)

词源:

Neo- (新) + pallium (地幔，外层)


The term "neopallium" combines the Greek prefix "neo-" (meaning "new") with "pallium," referring to a cloak or covering.  In this context, it describes the relatively recent evolutionary development of this brain region compared to older structures like the archipallium (paleocortex).  术语“新皮质”结合了希腊语前缀“neo-”（意思是“新的”）和“pallium”，指的是斗篷或覆盖物。在这种情况下，它描述了与较老的结构（如古皮质）相比，这个大脑区域相对较新的进化发展。
