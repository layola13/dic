myelin: /ˈmaɪəlɪn/ | n. |髓鞘；髓磷脂 | Myelin is a fatty substance that surrounds the axons of many neurons, forming an insulating layer that allows for faster nerve impulse transmission.  It's crucial for the proper functioning of the nervous system. | The damage to the myelin sheath can lead to multiple sclerosis. 髓鞘的损伤会导致多发性硬化症。|  insulation, sheath |  (无明显反义词，可考虑demyelination 脱髓鞘) | 名词
