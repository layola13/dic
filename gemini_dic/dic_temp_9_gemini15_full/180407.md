词源：

The word "regaining" comes from the verb "regain," which is formed from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the verb "gain" (meaning "to obtain or acquire").  Therefore, "regain" literally means "to gain again."  The "-ing" suffix indicates the present participle or gerund form, denoting the act of regaining.
