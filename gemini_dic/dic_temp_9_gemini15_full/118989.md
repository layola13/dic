PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "methanols" as it's a plural chemical term.  Phrases would typically involve "methanol" instead.  Examples using methanol:


methanol production: 甲醇生产
methanol fuel: 甲醇燃料
methanol poisoning: 甲醇中毒
methanol synthesis: 甲醇合成
methanol concentration: 甲醇浓度


词源:
From "methanol,"  which combines "methyl" (from "methane" + "-yl") and "-ol" (a suffix indicating an alcohol).  "Methane" itself comes from Greek  *meth- ("wine") and *an- ("up").  The "-yl" suffix indicates a univalent hydrocarbon radical.  The "-ol" suffix indicates an alcohol functional group.
