The word "sconcheon" is not a valid word in the English language.  There is no entry for it in any major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  The word may be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very obscure dialect.  If you could provide more context where you encountered this word, it might be possible to offer some educated guesses about its intended meaning.
