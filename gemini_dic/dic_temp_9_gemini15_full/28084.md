capillarity:/ˌkæpɪˈlærəti/| n. |毛细现象，毛细作用|The property of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of, or even in opposition to, external forces like gravity. This is due to the intermolecular forces between the liquid and the solid surface.  |Example: Capillarity is responsible for the rise of water in thin tubes and the absorption of water by plants. 毛细现象是细管中水面上升以及植物吸水的成因。|近义词：capillary action|反义词：None specifically, but concepts opposing the effect of capillarity could include gravity in certain contexts.|名词
