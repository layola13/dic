词源:

* **self-**:  From Old English *self, *sylf, meaning "self, same."  This element is ubiquitous in English, reflecting the importance of self-reference in language.

* **exertion**: From Middle English *exercioun, ultimately derived from Latin *exertionem (nominative *exertion), a noun of action from the verb *exertus, the past participle of *exertus, meaning "to raise, lift, rouse."  The Latin root *ex- means "out, from" and *ertus is related to the verb *regere, meaning "to direct, rule, guide."  Thus, "exertion" originally implied the act of putting forth effort to achieve something.
