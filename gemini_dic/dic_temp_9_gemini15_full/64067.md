USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a technical context, specifically within the field of classical prosody. It doesn't have common usage in everyday conversation or writing. Therefore, providing examples of tenses, voices, etc., is not applicable in the same way as for common words like "what".  Its usage is limited to discussions of meter and rhythm in poetry.

例句1：The analysis of the poem's meter revealed a significant number of epitrites in the final stanza. = 对这首诗的韵律分析揭示了最后一个小节中大量使用了抑扬格。

例句2：Scholars debate the effectiveness of using epitrites to create a specific rhythmic effect. = 学者们就使用抑扬格来创造特定节奏效果的有效性进行了辩论。
