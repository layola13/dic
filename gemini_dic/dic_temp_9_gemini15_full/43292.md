词源:
The word "craftworker" is a modern compound word.  "Craft" comes from the Old English *cræft, meaning "strength, power, skill," ultimately related to the Proto-Germanic *kraftaz. "Worker" derives from the Old English *wyrcere, meaning "maker, doer," related to the verb *wyrcan, "to work, make."  Therefore, "craftworker" literally means "one who works with skill and craft."
