词源:
The term "duct tape" originates from its initial use in the World War II era.  It was developed as a waterproof tape to seal ammunition boxes and other items in harsh conditions.  The "duct" refers to its use in sealing air ducts and other similar applications. While its original name may have been different, the name “duct tape” became widely associated with the product due to its versatility and applications in various types of ductwork.  Over time, its use expanded far beyond its original military applications, leading to its common usage in various households and industries for general repairs and various other purposes.
