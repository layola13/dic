词源:
The word "elusive" comes from the Middle English word "elusive," which comes from the Old French word "elusif," meaning "escaping," "avoiding."  The root is the Latin verb "ludere," meaning "to play," which gave rise to words suggesting deception and trickery.  The "e-" prefix in "elusive" likely reflects the influence of Latin "e-" prefixes indicating a negative or privative sense.
