词源:
The word "pontificated" derives from the Latin word "pontifex," meaning "bridge builder," a title originally held by Roman priests responsible for maintaining bridges and also for conducting religious ceremonies.  Over time, "pontifex" became associated with the Pope, the highest authority in the Catholic Church.  The verb "to pontificate" thus acquired the connotation of speaking with the authority (and often the perceived arrogance) of a Pope.
