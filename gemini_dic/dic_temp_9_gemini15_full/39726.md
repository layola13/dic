词源:
The word "consist" comes from the Latin word "consistere," which means "to stand together," "to be firm," or "to persist."  The prefix "con-" means "together," and the root "-sistere" is related to the verb "stare," meaning "to stand."  Therefore, the original meaning implied the elements standing together to form a whole.
