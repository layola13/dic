词源:

"High" is from Old English *hēah, meaning "high, tall".  "Technology" comes from Greek  τεχνολογία (technologia), a combination of τέχνη (techne), meaning "art, craft, skill," and -λογία (-logia), meaning "the study of".  Therefore, "high technologies" literally means "the study of advanced arts, crafts, and skills".
