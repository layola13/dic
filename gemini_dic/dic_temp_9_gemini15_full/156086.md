photoreceptors:/ˌfoʊtoʊrɪˈsɛptərz/ | n. |感光细胞|Specialized cells in the retina of the eye that convert light into electrical signals, enabling vision.  They are responsible for detecting light and initiating the process of visual perception.  There are two main types: rods and cones.  Rods are responsible for vision in low light conditions, while cones are responsible for color vision and visual acuity in bright light. |Example: The photoreceptors in the retina are crucial for translating light into neural signals. 感光细胞在视网膜中对于将光转化为神经信号至关重要。|近义词：light receptors, visual receptors |反义词：N/A
