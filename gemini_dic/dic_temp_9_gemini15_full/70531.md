词源:
The word "filibuster" ultimately derives from the Dutch word "vrijbuiter," meaning "freebooter" or "pirate."  In the 19th century, it was used to describe adventurers and revolutionaries, often with negative connotations. Its modern political meaning evolved from this earlier association with rebellious and obstructive actions.
