recursion's:/rɪˈkɜːʒənz/| n. |递归的；递归现象|The process of a function calling itself, either directly or indirectly.  This is a fundamental concept in computer science and mathematics, used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.|例句：The program uses recursion's to efficiently sort the data. = 该程序使用递归有效地对数据进行排序。|例句：Understanding recursion's is crucial for advanced programming. = 理解递归对于高级编程至关重要。|近义词：iteration, self-reference|反义词：iteration(in some contexts, as recursion is often contrasted with iterative approaches)
