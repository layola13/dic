词源:

The word "selvedge" comes from the Middle English "self-edge," which is a combination of "self" (meaning "same" or "identical") and "edge."  The "self" refers to the fact that the edge is created by the weaving process itself, not cut or finished separately.  Over time, the spelling evolved to the modern "selvedge."
