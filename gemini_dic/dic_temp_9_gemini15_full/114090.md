词源:

The word "magnificentness" is derived from the adjective "magnificent," which itself comes from the Middle French word "magnifique" and ultimately from the Latin word "magnificus."  "Magnificus" is a compound of "magnus" (great, large) and "facere" (to make, to do).  Therefore, "magnificent" originally meant "making great" or "great-making," and "magnificentness" is simply the noun form expressing the quality or state of being magnificent.


用法说明:

"Magnificentness" is a noun that refers to the quality or state of being magnificent.  It describes something that is impressive, splendid, or grand in appearance, quality, or extent. While grammatically correct, it's less frequently used than the adjective "magnificent" or synonyms like "grandeur" or "splendor."  The word often appears in more formal or literary contexts.
