nondistributional: /ˌnɒnˌdɪstrɪˈbjuːʃənəl/ | adj. | 非分布式的 |  Relating to or denoting a property or characteristic of a linguistic element that is not dependent on its distribution in a corpus or sample of language data.  It contrasts with distributional, which focuses on the occurrences and contexts of a word or phrase to determine its meaning or function.  Non-distributional methods often rely on other sources of linguistic information, such as semantic knowledge or syntactic structures, to analyze language.  |  The analysis relied on nondistributional methods, focusing on semantic relationships rather than word frequencies.  非分布式方法的分析，侧重于语义关系而非词频。 |  non-statistical, non-empirical | distributional | adj.
