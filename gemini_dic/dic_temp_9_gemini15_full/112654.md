词源：

The word is a compound of "low" (meaning small or little) and "budget" (referring to a plan for spending money).  "Budget" itself comes from the Old French word "bougette," meaning "small bag," referring to a bag used to carry money.  The metaphorical use of "budget" to refer to a plan for spending money evolved over time.
