The word "glassest" is not a standard English word.  It seems to be a misspelling or a non-standard formation.  There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries.  If it was intended to be a word, it could possibly be a plural of "glass" or a misspelling of a word entirely.  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested in the format is not possible.
