词源:
The word "fey" originates from the Middle English word "fey,"  meaning "fated," "doomed," or "destined."  Over time, its meaning shifted to describe someone or something possessing an otherworldly or magical quality, often associated with fairies or the supernatural realm.  The superlative "feyest" simply intensifies this quality.
