词源:  The word "outstaggering" is a relatively new formation, combining the prefix "out-" (meaning exceeding or surpassing) with "staggering" (meaning astonishing or overwhelming).  "Staggering" itself has roots in the Old English word "stagan," meaning "to stumble" or "to stagger," highlighting the overwhelming nature of something so impressive it makes one feel unsteady.
