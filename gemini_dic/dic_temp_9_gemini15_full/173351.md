quasi-devotedly: /ˈkwɑːziˌdɛvoʊtɪdli/ | adv. |近乎虔诚地，似是而非地虔诚地 |  Describes an action or feeling that resembles devotion but lacks its full intensity or sincerity. It implies a partial or superficial commitment.


英文解析:The adverb "quasi-devotedly" combines the prefix "quasi-" (meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent") with the adverb "devotedly" (meaning "in a devoted manner").  Therefore, it describes something done with a degree of devotion, but not entirely or wholeheartedly.  There's a suggestion of insincerity or a lack of complete commitment.
