词源:
The word "foiler" ultimately derives from the Old French word *foillir*, meaning "to fail" or "to be wanting."  Its meaning shifted over time, coming to refer to something that causes failure or acts as an obstacle.  The nautical use, referring to a sail-reducing device, is a later development.
