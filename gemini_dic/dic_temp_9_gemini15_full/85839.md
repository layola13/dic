hcfc:/ˈeɪtʃˌsiːˌɛfˈsiː/| n.|氢氯氟烃|Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are a class of chemical compounds that contain hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine, and carbon. They were developed as transitional substitutes for chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in refrigeration and other applications because they deplete the ozone layer less than CFCs. However, they still contribute to ozone depletion and are potent greenhouse gases.  |例句：The Montreal Protocol aimed to phase out the production and consumption of HCFCs. 《蒙特利尔议定书》旨在逐步淘汰 HCFC 的生产和消费。|近义词：CFC substitutes, ozone-depleting substances|反义词：Ozone-friendly substances|名词
