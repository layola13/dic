pre-modelling: /ˌpriːˈmɒdəlɪŋ/ | n. | 预建模，预先建模 | The process of creating a preliminary model or representation of something before a full-scale model is developed.  It often involves simplifying the system or problem to make it more manageable and to gain initial insights.  This can include making assumptions, using simplified data, or focusing on key aspects of the system. | Example: Pre-modelling of the airflow around the aircraft wing allowed engineers to identify potential problems early in the design process.  = 预先对飞机机翼周围的气流进行建模，使工程师能够在设计过程早期发现潜在问题。

The effectiveness of the final model is often heavily influenced by the quality of the pre-modelling stage. = 最终模型的有效性往往很大程度上取决于预建模阶段的质量。
