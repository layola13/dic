词源:

The word "meddler" comes from the Middle English word "meddlen," meaning "to mix, meddle, or interfere." This, in turn, is derived from the Old English word "maedlian," which had a similar meaning.  The suffix "-er" denotes an agent or doer of the action.  The core meaning has remained consistent through the centuries, focusing on unwanted interference in others' affairs.
