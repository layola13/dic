ohmmeter:/ˈoʊmˌmiːtər/ | n. |欧姆表 | An instrument used to measure electrical resistance in ohms.  It typically consists of a battery, a galvanometer, and several resistors arranged in a specific configuration.  | Example: The technician used an ohmmeter to check the resistance of the circuit. 技师用欧姆表检查电路的电阻。 | 近义词:resistance meter | 反义词:  (no direct antonym, as it measures a specific property)


USAGE->
