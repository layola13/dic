Word Origin:

The word is a relatively recent coinage, derived from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "fragility" (meaning "the quality of being easily broken or damaged").  The concept is closely related to the term "antifragility," coined by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, which describes systems that not only resist shocks but also benefit from them.  "Nonfragility" focuses more on the simple absence of fragility, while "antifragility" suggests an active benefit from stress.
