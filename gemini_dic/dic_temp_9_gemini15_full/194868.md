semi-conservative:/ˌsɛmiˈkɒnsɜːvətɪv/| adj.|半保留的|Describes a process, particularly in biology, where part of a structure or molecule is conserved or retained while the other part is newly synthesized.  In DNA replication, it refers to the mechanism where each new DNA molecule consists of one original strand and one newly synthesized strand.|Example: DNA replication is a semi-conservative process.  DNA复制是一个半保留的过程。|近义词：partially conservative, conservative (in part)|反义词：conservative (fully), dispersive


USAGE->

将来时:
Future research will likely further elucidate the mechanisms of semi-conservative replication. = 未来的研究可能会进一步阐明半保留复制的机制。
We will continue to study the implications of semi-conservative replication in various biological processes. = 我们将继续研究半保留复制在各种生物过程中的意义。


虚拟语气:
