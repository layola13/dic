The word "nacreous" is derived from the French word "nacré," which in turn comes from the Latin word "nacar," meaning "mother-of-pearl."  The ultimate origin is likely from Arabic.


用法说明：

Nacreous is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that has the appearance of mother-of-pearl—a smooth, iridescent substance lining the inner surface of some mollusk shells.  It often implies a shimmering, colorful quality, going beyond simple pearlescence.  It's frequently used to describe clouds (nacreous clouds, also known as polar stratospheric clouds) and sometimes gemstones or other materials with a similar sheen.
