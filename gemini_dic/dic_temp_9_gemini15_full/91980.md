近义词: hypernatremic (US spelling) | 反义词: hyponatraemic


词源:  The word "hypernatraemic" is a combination of three elements:

* **hyper-**:  From Greek ὑπέρ (hupér), meaning "over," "above," or "beyond."  It indicates an excessive or above-normal level.

* **natr-**: From Latin *natrium*,  referring to sodium (the element's historical name).  This element is derived from the Arabic word *natrun*, meaning "natron," a naturally occurring sodium carbonate.

* **-aemic**: From Greek -αιμία (-aemia), meaning "blood condition."  This suffix indicates a condition relating to the blood.


Therefore, hypernatraemic literally means "having an excessive amount of sodium in the blood."
