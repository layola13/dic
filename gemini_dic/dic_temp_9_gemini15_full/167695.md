词源：The word "pridelessly" is derived from the adjective "prideless," which itself is formed by adding the suffix "-less" (meaning "without") to the noun "pride."  The suffix "-ly" is then added to "prideless" to create the adverbial form "pridelessly."  The root word "pride" has Old English origins, ultimately tracing back to Proto-Germanic roots.
