WORD ORIGIN->
The word "equitabilities" is derived from the adjective "equitable," which comes from the Latin word "aequus," meaning "equal," "level," or "just."  The suffix "-able" makes it an adjective meaning "capable of being equal or just," and the suffix "-ities" forms the plural noun, indicating the qualities or states of being equitable.
