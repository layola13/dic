词源:  Derived from "kink," meaning a twist, bend, or irregularity.  The addition of "-iness" creates a noun indicating a state or quality of having kinks.  The sexual connotation developed later, associating "kink" with unusual sexual preferences or practices.  The plural "-es" indicates multiple instances of such behavior or preferences.
