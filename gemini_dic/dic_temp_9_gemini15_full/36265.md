cogwheels: /ˈkɒɡwiːlz/ | n. |齿轮；齿轮装置 | Interlocking toothed wheels working together to transmit power or motion.  Cogwheels are essential components in many machines, transferring rotational motion from one part to another.  They are often made of metal but can also be made of plastic or other materials. |例句：The old clock's cogwheels were worn down and needed replacing.  这台旧钟的齿轮磨损了，需要更换。

The intricate system of cogwheels powered the entire factory. 复杂的齿轮系统为整个工厂提供动力。|近义词：gears, gear wheels |反义词：None directly applicable, but could consider 'smooth operation' (as an antonym to the potential for grinding or malfunction of cogwheels)

词源:

The word "cogwheel" is a compound word.  "Cog" comes from the Old French word "cog," meaning "tooth" (of a wheel).  "Wheel" is from Old English "hweol."  Therefore, "cogwheel" literally means a "toothed wheel".
