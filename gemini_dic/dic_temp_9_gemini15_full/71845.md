The word "flemishes" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling or provide more context where you encountered this word?

2. **It's a neologism or dialect word:** It might be a newly coined word, a word specific to a particular region or community, or a technical term within a specialized field.  More context is needed.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (name of a person, place, or thing), which wouldn't have a standard dictionary definition.


Without more information, I cannot provide a detailed analysis as requested in the format.  Please provide the correct spelling or more context.
