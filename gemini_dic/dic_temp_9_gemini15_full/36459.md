词源:
The term "cold turkey" originates from the visible physical symptoms experienced during withdrawal from opioid drugs like heroin, where the skin can appear pale and goose-bumped, resembling the skin of a plucked turkey.  The image of a plucked, cold turkey became associated with the harsh reality of abrupt withdrawal, hence the term's adoption to describe the process of ceasing any addictive behavior without gradual reduction.
