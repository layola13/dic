The word "pocka" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a proper noun:**  Is it a name of a person, place, or thing?
* **It's a word from another language:**  If so, please specify the language.
* **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word or informal term not yet widely recognized.

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you'd like me to help you further.
