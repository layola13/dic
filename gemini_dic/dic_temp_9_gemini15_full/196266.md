词源:
The word "serenade" comes from the Italian word "serenata," which itself derives from the Latin "serenus," meaning "calm," "clear," or "serene."  Originally, a serenata was a musical piece performed outdoors at night, often under a calm and clear sky, hence the connection to the word's meaning.
