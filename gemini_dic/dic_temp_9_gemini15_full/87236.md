词源:

The word "heretic" comes from the Late Latin word *haerēticus*, which in turn derives from the Greek word αἱρετικός (hairetikos), meaning "capable of choosing," "selective," or "of a sect."  Originally, it simply referred to someone who made a choice, but in the context of early Christianity, it came to denote someone who chose to follow a belief system different from the established orthodoxy.  The shift in meaning reflects the increasingly rigid and intolerant nature of religious institutions.
