词源:
The phrasal verb "count on" originates from the verb "count," meaning to rely on or depend on something.  The "on" indicates the object of the reliance.  Its development reflects a shift in language where a simple verb ("count") evolved into a more nuanced phrasal verb to express a specific kind of reliance involving trust and expectation.
