词源:
The word "degraded" comes from the Latin word "degradare," which means "to bring down a step," "to lower in rank," or "to debase."  The prefix "de-" means "down" or "away," and "gradare" is related to "gradus," meaning "step" or "degree."  Thus, the word's root signifies a lowering or reduction in status, quality, or value.
