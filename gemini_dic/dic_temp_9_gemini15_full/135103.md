词源:  The word is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with "obsessional" (relating to obsession).  "Obsessional" derives from "obsession," which comes from the Latin word "obsidere," meaning "to besiege" or "to beset."  Thus, "nonobsessional" literally means "not besieged by an obsession."
