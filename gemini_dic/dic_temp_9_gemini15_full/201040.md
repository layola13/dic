词源:
The word "slopwork" is a compound word.  "Slop" originally meant watery or sloppy food or drink, implying something messy and carelessly made. When combined with "work," it creates a term to describe work that is similarly messy, careless, and of poor quality.  The origin of "slop" itself can be traced back to Middle English "sloppe," possibly related to the Dutch "sloppen" (to splash).
