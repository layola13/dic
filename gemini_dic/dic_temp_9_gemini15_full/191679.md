The word "schulzs" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a proper noun, possibly a surname (like "Schultz" with a misspelling).  Therefore, a detailed etymological and usage analysis as requested for a standard English word is not possible.

To provide a response in the requested format, we can analyze the likely intended word "Schultz," assuming it's a misspelling:


Schultz: /ʃʊlts/ | n. | 舒尔茨（姓氏） | A German surname.  The meaning and etymology are complex and depend on the specific family's history, but it likely derives from various German words relating to steward, bailiff, or a place name. |  My friend's name is John Schultz.  我的朋友名叫约翰·舒尔茨。  The Schultz family owns a large farm. 舒尔茨家族拥有一个大型农场。 |  Schmidt, Smith, Miller |  N/A (Surnames don't typically have antonyms) | n.


USAGE->  (Since Schultz is a proper noun, typical verb conjugations and grammatical usages don't apply directly.  The word functions primarily as a noun within sentences.)

PHRASE-> (Phrases involving Schultz would depend on the context of its use in a sentence.)  Examples:

The Schultz family reunion.  舒尔茨家族的团聚。
Working for Schultz & Sons. 为舒尔茨父子公司工作。
A book by author,  J. Schultz. 一本由J.舒尔茨作家撰写的书。
The Schultz building. 舒尔茨大楼。

**Note:**  If "schulzs" was intended as a different word, please provide more context or clarify the spelling.  Without additional information, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.
