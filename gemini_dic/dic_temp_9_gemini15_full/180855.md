词源:
The word "reheatable" is derived from the verb "reheat" and the suffix "-able," which indicates capability or suitability.  "Reheat" itself is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the verb "heat."  Therefore, the word's meaning directly reflects its etymology: capable of being heated again.
