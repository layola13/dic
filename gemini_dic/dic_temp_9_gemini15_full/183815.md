词源:

The word "reseasoned" is a compound word formed from the prefix "re-" and the adjective "seasoned."

* **re-**:  A prefix meaning "again," "anew," or "back."
* **seasoned**:  Originally referring to the process of adding salt, spices, or herbs to food to enhance its flavor, it has evolved to also mean "experienced" or "skilled" due to the analogy of something being improved through time and exposure.


用法说明：

As an adjective, "reseasoned" describes something that has been seasoned a second time, or more generally, something that has been improved or refined through further treatment or experience.  It's used most commonly in culinary contexts, but its figurative meaning is increasingly prevalent.

  The verb "reseason" is less common but refers to the act of seasoning something again.  The past participle of this verb, "reseasoned," functions as an adjective in the same way that "seasoned" does.
