The word "prestubborn" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  To assist, I need clarification:

1. **Is this a misspelling?**  If so, please provide the intended word.
2. **Is this a newly coined word?** If so, please provide context (where did you see/hear this word? what was the intended meaning?).

Once I have this information, I can provide a more accurate analysis.  I can, however, offer a hypothetical analysis *if* we assume it's a combination of "pre-" and "stubborn":

**Hypothetical Analysis (assuming "prestubborn"):**

/ˌpriːˈstʌbərn/ | adj. | 预先固执的；先天地固执的 |  Potentially meaning stubbornly resistant from the outset or inherently stubborn before any external influence.  This is a speculative definition since the word isn't established. |


* **Example Sentence (Hypothetical):**  "His prestubborn nature made negotiation impossible from the start." = 他先天地固执的性格使得谈判从一开始就无法进行。


* **Near Synonyms (Hypothetical):**  intransigent, inflexible, adamant, obdurate (These are close but don't fully capture the "pre-" aspect).


* **Antonyms (Hypothetical):**  yielding, compliant, flexible, amenable


* **Word Class:** Adjective


Because "prestubborn" is not a real word,  the USAGE section (tense conjugations, etc.) and PHRASE section are inapplicable.  A proper analysis requires knowing the correct or intended word.
