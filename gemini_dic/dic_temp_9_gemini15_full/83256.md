This contrasts with angiosperms, which produce flowers and fruits enclosing their seeds. | Examples of gymnosperms include conifers (pines, spruces, firs), cycads, and ginkgoes.  These plants are often found in colder climates and are characterized by their needle-like or scale-like leaves.  |近义词:gymnosperm|反义词:angiosperm|名词
