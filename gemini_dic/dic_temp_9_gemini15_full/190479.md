The word "sassorolla" is not a recognized word in English or any major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, parts of speech, meaning, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps a similar-sounding or -looking word was intended.
* It's a proper noun:  It might be a name (person, place, or thing) not included in standard dictionaries.
* It's a neologism or slang: A newly coined word or term used within a specific community or context.
* It's from another language:  The word might originate from a different language and hasn't been adopted into English.


If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, the surrounding text, etc.), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
