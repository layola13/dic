词源:
The word "concupiscent" comes from the Late Latin word *concupiscentia*, meaning "lust," "strong desire," or "covetousness."  This in turn derives from the verb *concupiscere*, meaning "to desire greatly" or "to lust after."  The prefix "con-" intensifies the meaning, while the root "-cupiscere" is related to the Latin word "cupere," meaning "to desire" or "to long for."
