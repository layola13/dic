词源：

The word "prosecutable" is derived from the verb "prosecute," which comes from the Late Latin word "prosecutus," the past participle of "prosequi."  "Prosequi" itself is a combination of the prefix "pro-" (forward) and "sequi" (to follow).  Therefore, the root meaning points to "following up" or "carrying on" a legal action.  The addition of "-able" creates the adjective form, indicating something capable of being prosecuted.
