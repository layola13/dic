This word is not a standard English word.  It's a non-standard plural form of a non-standard word "nondeceptiveness". While "deceptiveness" is a valid English word, adding "non-" to create "nondeceptiveness" and then pluralizing it to "nondeceptivenesses" is grammatically awkward and unusual.  Native English speakers would not typically use this word.  To express the concept, alternative phrasing is recommended.

For example, instead of "The nondeceptivenesses of the campaign were evident," one could say:

* "The campaign's honesty was evident."
* "The campaign was demonstrably truthful."
* "The campaign was transparent and lacked deception."
* "The campaign showed no signs of deception."


Because "nondeceptivenesses" is not a standard word, providing grammatical examples in various tenses, voices, etc., would be artificial and unhelpful.  The focus should be on using standard, clear English to express the intended meaning.
