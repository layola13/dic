Etymology:

The word "drudging" comes from the Old French word "druerie," meaning "drudgery" or "servitude."  This, in turn, likely has roots in a Germanic word related to the Old English "drude," meaning a "beloved" or "wife."  The semantic shift from "beloved" to "drudgery" is thought to be due to the association of women's traditional domestic work with both love and relentless toil.  Over time, the connotation shifted to emphasize the tedious and laborious aspects of the work.  The verb form "to drudge" developed from the noun form "drudgery."
