词源:

* **in-:**  prefix meaning "not" or "without"
* **dispensable:**  adjective meaning "not necessary; able to be done without"
* **-ness:**  suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives (e.g., "goodness," "sadness")  It indicates a state, quality, or condition.

Therefore, "indispensableness" means "the state or quality of being indispensable," and "indispensablenesses" is its plural form, referring to multiple instances or aspects of this state or quality.
