neutrons:/ˈnjuːtrɒnz/ /ˈnuːtrɑːnz/| n. |中子|A neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol n or n⁰, with no net electric charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton.  Neutrons are found in the nucleus of all atoms except for the most common isotope of hydrogen (protons and neutrons together constitute nearly all of the mass of an atom).|Example:  The nucleus of an atom contains protons and neutrons.|近义词：subatomic particle|反义词：proton (in terms of charge)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Neutrons are fundamental particles. = 中子是基本粒子。
The nucleus contains many neutrons. = 原子核包含许多中子。

一般过去时:
Scientists discovered neutrons in 1932. = 科学家在1932年发现了中子。
We studied the properties of neutrons. = 我们研究了中子的特性。

现在完成时:
Researchers have studied neutron stars extensively. = 研究人员已经广泛研究了中子星。
Scientists have learned much about neutron behavior. = 科学家已经了解了很多关于中子行为的知识。

过去完成时:
They had already detected the neutrons before the experiment concluded. = 他们在实验结束之前就已经探测到了中子。
Physicists had hypothesized the existence of neutrons prior to their discovery. = 物理学家在中子被发现之前就已经假设了中子的存在。

将来时:
Scientists will continue to explore the properties of neutrons. = 科学家们将继续探索中子的特性。
We will use neutrons in this experiment. = 我们将在本次实验中使用中子。

虚拟语气:
If neutrons had a charge, the atom would be unstable. = 如果中子带电，原子将不稳定。
It would be helpful if we understood neutrons better. = 如果我们能更好地理解中子，那就太好了。

被动语态:
Neutrons were discovered by Chadwick. = 中子是由查德威克发现的。
The experiment's results were explained by neutron interactions. = 实验结果是由中子相互作用解释的。

疑问句:
How many neutrons are in this atom? = 这个原子中有多少个中子？
What is the mass of a neutron? = 中子的质量是多少？

否定句:
Neutrons do not have an electric charge. = 中子不带电。
The experiment did not detect any neutrons. = 实验没有检测到任何中子。
