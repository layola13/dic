preaccordances: /ˌpriːəˈkɔːrdənsɪz/ | n. | 预先协议；预先一致；事前约定 |  The term "preaccordances" is not a standard English word found in common dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word.  It's likely formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before) and "accordances" (meaning agreements or harmonies). Therefore, it suggests agreements or understandings reached before a particular event or action.  Its meaning depends heavily on context. | Example:  The preaccordances between the two nations prevented a full-scale war. (两个国家之前的预先协议避免了一场全面战争。) |近义词: preliminary agreements, prior arrangements, prior understandings |反义词: disagreements, conflicts, disputes | 名词
