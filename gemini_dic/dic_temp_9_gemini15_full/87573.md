词源:

From hetero- (different) + phyllous (leafy).  "Hetero-" comes from the Greek word  ἕτερος (héteros) meaning "other" or "different," and "-phyllous" is derived from the Greek word  φύλλον (phýllon) meaning "leaf."


USAGE->
This word is primarily used as an adjective in botanical descriptions and scientific contexts.  Therefore, grammatical tenses and other aspects of usage are less relevant than understanding its meaning in describing plant morphology.  It doesn't have common usage in other grammatical forms like verbs or nouns.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "heterophyllous."  The term itself is quite specific to botany.
