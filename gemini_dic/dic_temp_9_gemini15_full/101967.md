isobars:/ˈaɪsoʊbɑːrz/| n.|等压线；等压图；同量异位素|Lines on a map connecting points of equal atmospheric pressure.  Isobars are used in meteorology to depict areas of high and low pressure, helping to predict weather patterns.  The term also refers to nuclides (atomic nuclei) that have the same mass number but different atomic numbers. These are isotopes with the same number of nucleons (protons and neutrons).|

例句：

The weather map showed a series of isobars indicating a low-pressure system approaching. = 天气图显示了一系列等压线，表明低压系统正在逼近。

Scientists studied the properties of different isobars of carbon to understand nuclear stability. = 科学家研究了不同碳同量异位素的特性，以了解原子核的稳定性。
