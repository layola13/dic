英文解析:Hyperobtrusiveness refers to the quality or state of being excessively noticeable, intrusive, or prominent.  It suggests an overwhelming presence or attention-grabbing nature that is often unwelcome or irritating.  It goes beyond mere obtrusiveness and implies a degree of aggression or dominance in its presentation.

词源:

The word is formed by combining several elements:

* **hyper-**:  A prefix meaning "excessive" or "above."
* **obtrusive**:  Meaning "noticeable in an unwelcome or intrusive way."  This itself is derived from the verb "obtrude," meaning "to thrust oneself forward."
* **-ness**: A suffix forming nouns of state or quality.

Therefore, hyperobtrusiveness literally means "the state of being excessively obtrusive."
