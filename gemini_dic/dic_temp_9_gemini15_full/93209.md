Etymology:

The word "ignoscible" is derived from the Latin prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the verb "gnoscere" (meaning "to know").  However, its direct formation isn't from a single Latin word. It's more of a learned coinage, drawing on the related concept of "ignorance" (lack of knowledge) as a mitigating factor for wrongdoing.  The "in-" prefix is then used in a negative way to create the positive concept of something being forgivable.
