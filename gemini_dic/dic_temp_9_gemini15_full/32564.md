词源:
The word "chip" ultimately derives from the Old English word *cippan*, meaning "to cut, chop, or slice".  Its evolution reflects the process of creating thin slices, whether from potatoes (chips/fries) or wood/stone.  The application to electronic components is a more recent and metaphorical extension of the meaning of a small, thin piece.
