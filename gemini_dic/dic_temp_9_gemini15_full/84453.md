halogens:/ˈhælədʒənz/| n. |卤素|Halogens are a group of five non-metallic elements in the periodic table: fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), bromine (Br), iodine (I), and astatine (At). They are highly reactive and readily form salts with metals.  They are characterized by their tendency to gain one electron to achieve a stable electron configuration.|Example:  Fluorine, chlorine, bromine, iodine, and astatine are all halogens.|近义词：None (as a group).|反义词：None (as a group).|


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The halogens react readily with metals. = 卤素容易与金属反应。
Chlorine is used in water purification. = 氯用于水净化。


一般过去时:

We used iodine to sterilize the wound. = 我们用碘来消毒伤口。


现在完成时:
Researchers have studied the reactivity of halogens extensively. = 研究人员已经广泛研究了卤素的反应性。
They have found new applications for bromine compounds. = 他们发现了溴化合物的新的应用。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had prepared the halogen samples. = 实验前，他们已经准备好了卤素样品。

将来时:
Scientists will continue to investigate the uses of halogens. = 科学家们将继续研究卤素的用途。
We will need more chlorine for the next experiment. = 下一个实验我们将需要更多的氯。


虚拟语气:
If we had more bromine, we could conduct the experiment. = 如果我们有更多的溴，我们就能进行实验。
