词源:
The word "infestation" comes from the verb "infest," which in turn comes from the Latin word "infestare," meaning "to attack, assail, or beset."  The suffix "-ation" forms nouns of action or process.  Therefore, "infestation" literally means the act of being attacked or overrun by something harmful.
