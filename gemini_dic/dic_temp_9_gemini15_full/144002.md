词源:

The word "outreaching" comes from the verb "outreach," which combines the preposition "out" (meaning beyond or exceeding) and the verb "reach" (meaning to extend to or arrive at a place or point).  The "-ing" suffix indicates the present participle or gerund form, denoting the action of reaching out.
