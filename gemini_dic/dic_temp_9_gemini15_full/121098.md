词源:
The word "miscreant" comes from the Old French word "mescreant," which means "unbeliever" or "heretic."  It was originally used to describe someone who did not believe in the Christian faith. Over time, its meaning shifted to encompass anyone who behaved badly or violated social norms, eventually settling on its current meaning of a villain or criminal.
