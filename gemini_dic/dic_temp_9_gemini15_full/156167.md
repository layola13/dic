词源:
The word "photovoltaic" is a combination of "photo," from the Greek word φῶς (phos) meaning "light," and "voltaic," referring to Alessandro Volta, the inventor of the voltaic pile (an early electric battery).  The "-ic" suffix indicates an adjective.  Therefore, "photovoltaic" literally means "relating to light and Volta's invention," specifically the generation of electricity from light.
