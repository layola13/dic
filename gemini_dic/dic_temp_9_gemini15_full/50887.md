词源:  The word "deserter" comes from the verb "desert," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "deserter" meaning "to forsake" or "abandon."  This, in turn, comes from the Latin word "desertus," the past participle of "deserere," meaning "to abandon," "to leave," or "to forsake."  The -er suffix is a common agentive suffix in English, indicating the person who performs the action.
