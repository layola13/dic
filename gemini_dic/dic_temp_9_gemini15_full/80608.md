词源:
The word "goonda" originates from the Hindi language. Its etymology is uncertain, but it's believed to be derived from a combination of elements suggesting violence or aggression.  While a precise origin remains elusive, its usage clearly reflects a history of associating the term with criminal and antisocial behavior.  The word's spread beyond Hindi-speaking regions reflects its adoption into broader Indian English and even international contexts when discussing organized crime or violent street gangs in South Asia.
