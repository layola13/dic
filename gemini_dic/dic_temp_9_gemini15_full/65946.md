WORD ORIGIN->

The word "exactingness" is derived from the adjective "exacting," which means demanding much care, attention, or precision.  "Exacting" itself comes from the verb "exact," meaning to demand something strictly or forcefully. The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun signifying the quality or state of being exacting.  The etymology traces back to the Old French "exacter" (to demand) and ultimately to the Latin "exigere" (to drive out, demand).
