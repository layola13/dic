USAGE->
This word is a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "what" does.  Therefore, verb tenses (present, past, future, etc.) and other grammatical structures such as passive voice, don't apply to "haematocrya" itself. We can, however, use it in sentences with verbs conjugated in different tenses.

Example Sentences:

Present Simple:  The doctor observed haematocrya in the patient's left eye. = 医生观察到病人左眼有血泪。

Past Simple:  Haematocrya was a significant finding in the initial examination. = 血泪是在初步检查中的一个重要发现。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "haematocrya" as it's a rare medical term.  Phrases would focus on the condition itself, for example:  "cases of haematocrya," "diagnosis of haematocrya," "treatment for haematocrya."
