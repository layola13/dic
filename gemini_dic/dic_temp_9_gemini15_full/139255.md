Etymology:  The word "obligedness" derives from the verb "oblige," which comes from the Old French word "obliger," meaning "to bind," "to constrain," or "to force."  This ultimately traces back to the Latin word "obligare," which is a combination of "ob-" (towards, against) and "ligare" (to bind). The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix forming abstract nouns denoting a state, quality, or condition.
