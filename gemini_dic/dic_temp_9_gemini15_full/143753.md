词源:
The word "outmanoeuvre" is a combination of "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent than") and "manoeuvre" (from French "manoeuvre," ultimately from Old French "manoevre," meaning "work by hand," related to Latin "manus" meaning "hand").  It thus literally means "to perform maneuvers to a greater degree than" someone else.
