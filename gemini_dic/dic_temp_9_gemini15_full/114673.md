词源:

The word "malignance" derives from the Old French word "malignaunce," which itself comes from the Latin word "malignantia."  "Malus" in Latin means "bad" or "evil," and "-antia" is a suffix indicating a quality or state.  Therefore, the word's roots point directly to its meaning of "evilness" or "harmfulness."
