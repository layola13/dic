词源:
The word "deficiency" comes from the Old French word "deficience," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "deficientia," the gerundive of "deficere," meaning "to fail," "to be wanting," or "to be lacking."  The prefix "de-" indicates "away from" or "lack of," and the root "-ficere" is related to the verb "facere," meaning "to make" or "to do."  Therefore, "deficiency" literally means "a state of being lacking or insufficient."
