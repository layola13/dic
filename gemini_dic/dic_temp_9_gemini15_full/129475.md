词源:
The term "non-alignment" is a compound word formed from "non-" (meaning "not") and "alignment" (meaning "the action of aligning something").  The concept emerged during the Cold War as a response to the bipolar world order dominated by the US and the Soviet Union.  Many newly independent nations sought to avoid being drawn into either superpower's sphere of influence.
