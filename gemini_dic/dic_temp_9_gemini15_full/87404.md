Etymology:

The word "herring" comes from the Old English word "hæring," which itself is derived from the Proto-Germanic word "*harinjō," meaning "herring."  The word's ultimate origin is unclear, but may be related to words signifying "army" or "band," reflecting the schooling behavior of herring.  The plural form "herrings" follows the regular English pluralization rule for nouns.
