词源：

The word is formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") with "ethereal" (meaning "extremely delicate and light; seemingly not of this world").  Therefore, "nonethereal" literally means "not ethereal."  The word "ethereal" itself originates from the Greek word "aither" (αιθήρ), referring to the upper air or sky, later associated with a fifth element in ancient philosophy.


用法说明：

"Nonethereal" is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that is lacking the delicate, light, or spiritual quality often associated with ethereal things. It emphasizes the grounded, mundane, or earthly aspect of something.  It contrasts directly with "ethereal," highlighting a lack of the qualities described by that word.
