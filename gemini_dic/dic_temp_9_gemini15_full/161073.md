postcuring:/ˌpoʊstˈkjʊərɪŋ/ | n. | 后固化；后固化处理 | The process of further curing a material after its initial curing.  This is often done to improve the material's properties, such as strength, durability, and dimensional stability.  Post-curing can involve heat treatment, exposure to UV light, or other methods. | 例句：The postcuring process significantly improved the tensile strength of the composite material. 后固化过程显著提高了复合材料的抗拉强度。

The manufacturer recommends a postcuring cycle to optimize the performance of the adhesive. 制造商建议进行后固化循环以优化粘合剂的性能。| 近义词：after-curing, secondary curing | 反义词：pre-curing
