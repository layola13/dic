The word "confusing" is not provided in your request.  The word you provided is "{contusing}", which is not a valid English word.  I cannot provide a detailed analysis for a word that does not exist.

If you intended to ask about a different word, please provide the correct spelling.  For example, did you perhaps mean "confusing"?  If so, I can provide the requested analysis.
