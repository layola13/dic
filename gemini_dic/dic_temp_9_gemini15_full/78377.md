词源:
The word "gestured" comes from the Old French word "gesturer," meaning "to make a gesture."  This, in turn, is derived from the Latin word "gestus," meaning "deed, act, posture, gesture."  The root is related to the Latin verb "gerere," meaning "to bear, carry, do, perform."  Therefore, the word's history reflects the act of expressing something through physical movement.
