词源:
The word "misregard" comes from the prefix "mis-" meaning "wrongly" or "badly," combined with "regard," which originally meant "to look at" or "to consider."  Therefore, "misregard" literally means "to consider wrongly" or "to look at incorrectly," implying a failure to give proper attention or consideration.
