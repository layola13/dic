将来时:
The new feature will make the system semifunctional until further development. = 新功能将使系统在进一步开发之前处于半功能状态。
The software will be semifunctional until the next release. = 该软件将在下一次发布之前处于半功能状态。


虚拟语气:
If the system were semifunctional, we could start testing. = 如果系统是半功能的，我们可以开始测试。
I wish the prototype were semifunctional, so we could demonstrate its core functionality. = 我希望原型是半功能的，这样我们就可以演示其核心功能。


被动语态:

PHRASE->
semifunctional prototype = 半功能原型
semifunctional testing = 半功能测试
semifunctional system = 半功能系统

词源:
The word "semifunctional" is a combination of "semi-" (meaning "half," "partly," or "partially") and "functional" (meaning "having or involving a function or purpose").  Therefore, it literally means "partly functional".
