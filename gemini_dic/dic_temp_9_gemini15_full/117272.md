mechanistic:/ˌmɛkəˈnɪstɪk/ | adj. | 机械的；机械论的；缺乏灵活性的 | Relating to or characteristic of mechanism; concerned with the mechanics of something.  It often implies a lack of spontaneity or flexibility. | 例句：The mechanistic approach to teaching ignored the students' individual needs. 机械化的教学方法忽略了学生的个人需求。  The factory's mechanistic processes resulted in repetitive tasks for the workers. 工厂的机械化流程导致工人们重复进行同样的工作。 | 近义词：automatic, deterministic, robotic, inflexible | 反义词：organic, spontaneous, flexible, creative

Future developments will likely reveal a less mechanistic explanation. = 未来的发展可能会揭示一个不那么机械化的解释。


虚拟语气:
If the system were purely mechanistic, we would expect consistent results. = 如果系统纯粹是机械的，我们会期望得到一致的结果。
It would be simpler if the explanation were entirely mechanistic. = 如果解释完全是机械的，那就简单多了。


被动语态:
The experiment was conducted in a highly mechanistic fashion. = 实验以高度机械的方式进行。
All the steps in the process are mechanistically controlled. = 该过程中的所有步骤都由机械控制。


疑问句:
Is the model truly mechanistic, or are there other factors at play? = 这个模型是真正机械的吗？还是有其他因素在起作用？
Are the observed behaviours purely mechanistic in nature? = 观察到的行为本质上纯粹是机械的吗？


否定句:
