Etymology:  The word "nucleolated" is derived from "nucleolus" + "-ated".  "Nucleolus" itself comes from the Latin word "nucleolus," a diminutive of "nucleus," meaning "kernel" or "little nut." The suffix "-ated" indicates the presence or condition of having something.  Therefore, "nucleolated" literally means "having little kernels (nucleoli)."
