calcite:/ˈkælsaɪt/| n. |方解石|A common and widespread mineral, a crystalline form of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃). It is the principal constituent of limestone and marble.  Calcite is known for its relatively low hardness (3 on the Mohs scale) and its property of double refraction, meaning that light passing through it is split into two rays. |The cave was filled with stunning calcite formations.  这山洞里充满了令人惊叹的方解石构造。

The calcite crystals were beautifully clear. 方解石晶体非常清澈。|limestone, aragonite |(None readily available as a direct antonym;  perhaps "non-carbonate mineral" but that's not a precise opposite)|名词
