radiability: /ˌreɪdiəˈbɪləti/ | n. |辐射能力，可辐射性 | The capacity of a substance or object to emit radiation.  This term often refers to the ability of a material to emit electromagnetic radiation, such as heat or light, or ionizing radiation, such as alpha, beta, or gamma rays.  The level of radiability depends on factors such as the material's composition, temperature, and the presence of radioactive isotopes. | Example: The radiability of the uranium sample was measured using a Geiger counter.  铀样品的辐射能力是用盖革计数器测量的。 The high radiability of the sun is responsible for life on Earth. 太阳的高辐射能力是地球生命存在的关键。 | 近义词：emissivity, radiation capacity | 反义词：non-radiability (this is not a commonly used word, the opposite concept is usually expressed by describing the lack of radiation)


USAGE->
This word is a noun and doesn't conjugate like a verb.  Therefore, standard verb tenses are not applicable.  The usage focuses on how to describe or quantify the degree of radiability.


Example sentences illustrating different aspects of usage:

Comparative: The radiability of this material is higher than that of the previous one.  这种材料的辐射能力高于前一种材料。

Superlative:  This substance exhibits the highest radiability we've ever observed.  这种物质表现出我们观察到的最高辐射能力。

Quantifying: The radiability of the source was measured to be 10 Gray per hour.  该源的辐射能力测量值为每小时10格雷。

Contextual:  The experiment focused on determining the factors influencing the radiability of the new composite material.  该实验的重点是确定影响新型复合材料辐射能力的因素。


PHRASE->
high radiability 高辐射能力
low radiability 低辐射能力
thermal radiability 热辐射能力
specific radiability 特定辐射能力
radiability measurement 辐射能力测量
