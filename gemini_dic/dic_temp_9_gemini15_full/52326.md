diclinous:/ˈdaɪklaɪnəs/| adj. |雌雄异株的，单性的| Having stamens and pistils in separate flowers on the same plant.  Diclinous flowers are unisexual, meaning they possess either stamens (male reproductive organs) or pistils (female reproductive organs), but not both. This contrasts with hermaphroditic flowers, which have both male and female reproductive parts in the same flower. | Example:  Many oak trees are diclinous, with separate male and female flowers on the same tree.  许多橡树是雌雄异株的，同一棵树上有单独的雄花和雌花。|近义词：unisexual, monoecious (if on the same plant)|反义词：hermaphroditic, bisexual
