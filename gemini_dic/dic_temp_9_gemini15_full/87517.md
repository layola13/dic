词源:  The word "heterodoxly" is derived from the Greek words "heteros" (other, different) and "doxa" (opinion, belief).  The prefix "hetero-" indicates "other" or "different," while "-dox" relates to belief or opinion. The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective "heterodox" into an adverb.  Therefore, "heterodoxly" signifies "in a manner contrary to established belief or opinion."
