The phrase originates from the literal image of something (like an insect) flying directly into someone's face, a bold and confrontational action.  The figurative meaning developed from this, representing a direct and unapologetic opposition.  While the precise origin date is difficult to pinpoint, its usage solidified in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
