cardioid:/ˈkɑːrdiɔɪd/| n. |心形线，心脏线|A cardioid is a plane curve traced by a point on the circumference of a circle that is rolling around a fixed circle of the same radius.  It is a type of epicycloid with a single cusp.  The curve resembles a heart shape.|Example: The microphone's cardioid pickup pattern ensured clear sound recording even in a noisy environment.  心形麦克风的拾音模式确保即使在嘈杂的环境中也能清晰地录音。|近义词：heart-shaped (in terms of shape)|反义词：None (no direct antonym)|
