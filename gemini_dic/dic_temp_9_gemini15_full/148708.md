词源:

The word "overtone" comes from the combination of "over-" (meaning above or beyond) and "tone."  Originally referring to a harmonic sound in music, its meaning extended to encompass secondary or implicit meanings in language and other contexts.  The musical sense reflects the physical phenomenon of overtones in sound production, where higher frequencies are produced alongside the fundamental tone.


用法说明:

Overtones are secondary or implicit meanings, suggestions, or implications associated with a word, phrase, or action.  They are not explicitly stated but are understood or felt by the listener or observer.  These implicit meanings often carry emotional or cultural weight, adding layers of meaning beyond the literal.  The interpretation of overtones can be subjective and vary across individuals and cultures.
