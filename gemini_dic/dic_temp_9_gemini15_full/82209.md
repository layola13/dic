词源:
The word "grotesque" ultimately derives from the Italian word "grottesco," which in turn comes from the Italian word "grotta," meaning "cave."  This is because the term originally referred to the fanciful, often monstrous, decorations found in Roman grottoes (caves).  These decorations often featured bizarre combinations of human and animal forms.  Over time, the word's meaning evolved to encompass anything oddly or monstrously shaped or distorted.
