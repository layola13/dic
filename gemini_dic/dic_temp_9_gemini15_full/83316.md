词源:
The word "gyp" as a verb meaning "to cheat" or "to swindle" originated in the 19th century. Its etymology is uncertain, but the most widely accepted theory links it to the ethnic slur "gypsy," which itself has a complex and controversial history.  The association likely arose from stereotypes and prejudices against Romani people, falsely associating them with dishonesty.  The noun form "gyp" (meaning a swindle or cheat) followed naturally from the verb.  An older, less common meaning of "gyp" refers to an Egyptian, reflecting an earlier usage now considered archaic and offensive.
