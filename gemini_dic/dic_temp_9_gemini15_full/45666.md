词源:

The word "curtained" is derived from the noun "curtain," which ultimately traces back to the Old French word "cortina," meaning "curtain."  This, in turn, has roots in the Latin word "cortina," also meaning "curtain," possibly related to "cortis," meaning "court" or "enclosure," suggesting the original use of curtains to enclose or divide spaces.
