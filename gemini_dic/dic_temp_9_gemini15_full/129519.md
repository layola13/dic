The word "non-attics" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a newly coined word or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need to understand the intended meaning.  Is it meant to be:

* **A negation of "attics"?**  This would mean "not attics" or "places that are not attics."  In this case, the analysis would be based on the word "attic."

* **A misspelling of another word?** If so, please provide the correct spelling or context.

* **A newly created term within a specific field?**  If so, please provide the context where you encountered this term.


If you clarify the intended meaning or provide context, I can offer a more accurate analysis.
