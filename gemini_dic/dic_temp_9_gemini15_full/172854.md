quadruplenesses:/kwɑːˈdruːplnəsɪz/| n. |四倍性；四重性；四重特征|The word "quadruplenesses" is extremely rare and not found in standard dictionaries. It's likely a nonce word, meaning it's coined for a specific occasion and not in common usage. It suggests multiple instances of quadrupleness (the state of being fourfold or having four parts).  It could refer to four sets of quadruplets, four instances of a four-part structure, or similar scenarios.  There is no standard definition or usage.| Example sentence creation is difficult given the word's rarity and lack of established meaning.  A possible, albeit contrived, example might be: "The researcher noted the intriguing quadruplenesses in the data, each representing a distinct four-part genetic sequence."|近义词:  There are no direct synonyms as the word is unconventional.  One might use phrases like "multiple instances of quadruplets," "several fourfold occurrences," or "repeated four-part structures" depending on the intended context.|反义词:  There are no direct antonyms.  One could use words implying singularity or duality, such as "singleness," "duality," or "tripleness," depending on the context, but these would describe the opposite of the implied concept rather than the word itself.|名词
