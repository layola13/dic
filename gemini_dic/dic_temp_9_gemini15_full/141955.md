The word "oreg" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, an abbreviation, or a word from a very specialized field.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
