词源:

The word "overcivilize" is a relatively modern formation, combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the verb "civilize" (from Latin *civilis, meaning "of or relating to citizens").  The process reflects a growing awareness and critique of the potential negative consequences of excessive refinement and the loss of certain aspects of "natural" or "primitive" life considered valuable by some.
