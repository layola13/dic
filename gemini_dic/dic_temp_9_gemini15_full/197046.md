The word "shaloms" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a pluralization attempt of the Hebrew word "Shalom." Therefore, a detailed analysis in the requested format is not possible.  However, I can provide information on the word "Shalom":


Shalom: /ʃəˈloʊm/ | n. | 和平；平安；问候 | Peace, completeness, wholeness, well-being; also used as a greeting (similar to "hello" or "goodbye"). |  Example: "Shalom, my friend." = “你好，我的朋友。”  "May peace be upon you." = “愿平安与你同在。” | 近义词：peace, tranquility, well-being, hello, goodbye | 反义词：war, chaos, discord


USAGE->

(Since Shalom is a noun and a greeting, typical verb conjugations don't apply. The usage examples below focus on its function as a greeting and noun)

As a Greeting:

Shalom! = 你好！/ 再见！
Shalom aleichem = 平安与你们同在 (a traditional Jewish greeting)


As a Noun:

We strive for shalom in our community. = 我们努力在我们的社区中实现和平。
The peace agreement brought shalom to the region. = 和平协议为该地区带来了和平。


PHRASE->

There aren't common phrases built directly around "Shalom" in the same way as "what" in English.  However,  "Shalom Aleichem" (Peace be upon you) and its response "Aleichem Shalom" (Upon you peace) are common phrases in Jewish culture.
