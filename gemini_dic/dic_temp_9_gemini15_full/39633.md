词源:

The word "consequentialist" is derived from the word "consequence," which comes from the Old French word "consequente," meaning "following,"  and ultimately from the Latin word "consequi," meaning "to follow, obtain, achieve." The "-ist" suffix denotes a person or doctrine associated with something.  Therefore, "consequentialist" refers to someone who adheres to a philosophy that emphasizes the consequences of actions.
