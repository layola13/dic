词源:  Derived from the adjective "reliable," which itself comes from the verb "rely" (to depend on; to trust).  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb.  The root "re-" indicates "again" or "back," and "ly" ultimately comes from Old English "-lice," meaning "like."  Therefore, the word's core meaning is connected to the idea of repeatedly being able to be depended upon.


USAGE->

PHRASE->
(Phrases with "reliantly" are less common than phrases built around the adjective "reliable," for example, "reliable source," "reliable method," etc.)  Because "reliantly" is an adverb it's less likely to be used in common phrases.  It's more likely to be used as a single word to describe a verb.
