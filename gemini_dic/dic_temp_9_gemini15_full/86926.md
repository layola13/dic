词源:  The word "hemorrhagic" is derived from the Greek words "haima" (αἷμα), meaning "blood," and "rhegnynai" (ῥήγνυμι), meaning "to burst forth" or "to break." The suffix "-ic" indicates an adjective.  Therefore, "hemorrhagic" literally means "relating to or characterized by a bursting forth of blood."
