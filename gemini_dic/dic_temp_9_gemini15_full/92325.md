Word Origin:

The word "hypnotizabilities" is derived from "hypnotize" + "-ability".  "Hypnotize" itself comes from "hypnosis," which originates from the Greek word "hypnos," meaning "sleep."  The "-ability" suffix denotes capacity or potential. Therefore, "hypnotizabilities" literally means "the capacity or potential to be hypnotized."
