nonsister: /ˈnɑːnsɪstər/ | adj. | 非姐妹的 | Not a sister; referring to chromosomes or genes that are not on the same chromosome or not inherited from the same parent.  | Example: The nonsister chromatids exchange genetic material during crossing over. 非姐妹染色单体在交叉互换过程中交换遗传物质。 | 近义词: unrelated, dissimilar | 反义词: sister

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The gene is nonsister to the other. = 这个基因与另一个基因并非姐妹基因。
These chromosomes are nonsister. = 这些染色体并非姐妹染色体。


一般过去时:
The researchers found that the genes were nonsister. = 研究人员发现这些基因并非姐妹基因。
We determined that the chromatids were nonsister. = 我们确定这些染色单体并非姐妹染色单体。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified many nonsister chromatid exchanges. = 科学家们已经鉴定了许多非姐妹染色单体交换。
Studies have shown that nonsister chromatids can recombine. = 研究表明非姐妹染色单体可以重组。


过去完成时:
They had already established that the genes were nonsister before the experiment. = 他们在实验之前已经确定这些基因并非姐妹基因。
It had been previously demonstrated that nonsister chromatid exchange could occur. = 此前已证明非姐妹染色单体交换可以发生。


将来时:
Further research will identify more nonsister gene interactions. = 后续研究将识别更多非姐妹基因相互作用。
We will analyze whether these are sister or nonsister chromatids. = 我们将分析这些是姐妹染色单体还是非姐妹染色单体。


虚拟语气:
If those were nonsister chromatids, the result would be different. = 如果那些是非姐妹染色单体，结果将会不同。
I wish I had known these were nonsister chromosomes earlier. = 我希望我早点知道这些是非姐妹染色体。


被动语态:
The nonsister chromatids were observed to exchange genetic material. = 观察到非姐妹染色单体交换了遗传物质。
It was determined that the genes were nonsister. = 确定这些基因并非姐妹基因。


疑问句:
Are these chromatids sister or nonsister? = 这些染色单体是姐妹染色单体还是非姐妹染色单体？
Is this gene nonsister to the one on chromosome 2? = 这个基因与2号染色体上的基因是非姐妹基因吗？


否定句:
These are not nonsister chromatids; they are sister chromatids. = 这些不是非姐妹染色单体；它们是姐妹染色单体。
The genes are not nonsister; they are linked. = 这些基因并非非姐妹基因；它们是连锁的。


PHRASE->
