WORD ORIGIN->
The term "lymph gland" is a compound word.  "Lymph" comes from the Latin word "lympha," meaning "clear water," referring to the watery fluid it contains. "Gland" comes from the Old French word "glande," ultimately from the Latin "glandula," a diminutive of "glans," meaning "acorn," referring to the shape of many glands.  Therefore, "lymph gland" literally means "a gland that deals with lymph."
