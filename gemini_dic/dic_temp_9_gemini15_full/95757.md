反义词：conspicuously, openly, obviously, blatantly


词源:

* **in-:**  prefix meaning "not" or "in".
* **con-:** prefix meaning "with" or "together".
* **spicere (Latin):** to look, to see.
* **-ous:** adjective suffix.
* **-ly:** adverb suffix.

The word essentially means "not easily seen together" or "not easily noticeable".  It developed through the Latin word "spicere", evolving into "conspicuous" (easily seen) and then the addition of "in-" created the opposite meaning.
