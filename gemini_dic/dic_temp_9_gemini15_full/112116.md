词源:
The word "longspun" is a compound word combining "long" (meaning extended in time or space) and the past participle "spun" (from the verb "spin," meaning to draw out or create something, often in a metaphorical sense, as in spinning a yarn or spinning a web of lies).  The combination suggests something excessively drawn out or elaborately constructed.
