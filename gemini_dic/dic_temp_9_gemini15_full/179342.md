词源:  The word "redoubtably" derives from the Old French word "redouter," meaning "to fear" or "to dread."  The suffix "-ably" transforms the verb into an adverbial form, meaning "in a way that inspires fear or respect," which then evolved into its adjectival usage.  The connection to "redoubt," a fortified position, highlights the sense of strength and defensive capability implied by the word.
