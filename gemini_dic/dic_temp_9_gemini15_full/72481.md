This word is a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations or other grammatical variations like the example word "what".  The grammatical usage would be consistent with other nouns.  For example:


一般现在时:
Fluocerine is found in pegmatites. = 氟铈矿存在于伟晶岩中。
The sample contains fluocerine. = 样本含有氟铈矿。


一般过去时:
Geologists found fluocerine in the mine. = 地质学家在矿井中发现了氟铈矿。
They analyzed the fluocerine sample. = 他们分析了氟铈矿样本。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified fluocerine in several locations. = 科学家已在多个地点发现了氟铈矿。
We have studied the properties of fluocerine. = 我们已经研究了氟铈矿的特性。


过去完成时:
They had already discovered fluocerine before the expedition. = 在探险队出发之前，他们已经发现了氟铈矿。
Researchers had examined the fluocerine sample prior to the publication. = 研究人员在发表论文之前已经检查了氟铈矿样本。


将来时:
Researchers will analyze the newly discovered fluocerine. = 研究人员将分析新发现的氟铈矿。
We will publish our findings on fluocerine next year. = 我们将在明年发表关于氟铈矿的研究成果。


被动语态:
Fluocerine was first discovered in [location]. = 氟铈矿首次在[地点]被发现。
