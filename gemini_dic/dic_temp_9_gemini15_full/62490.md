endostome:/ˈɛndoʊstoʊm/| n. |内胚层，内皮层|The inner layer of a structure, particularly referring to the inner layer of the sporangium in certain mosses and liverworts.  It is involved in spore dispersal. |例句：The endostome of the sporangium played a crucial role in the efficient release of spores.  内孢子的内胚层在孢子的有效释放中起着至关重要的作用。

|例句：Researchers studied the morphology of the endostome in various moss species to understand its evolutionary significance. 研究人员研究了各种苔藓物种内胚层的形态，以了解其进化意义。|近义词：inner layer, inner membrane|反义词：exostome|词性:名词
