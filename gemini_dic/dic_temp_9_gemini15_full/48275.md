词源:
The word "decoupled" is derived from the verb "couple," meaning to connect or link.  The prefix "de-" indicates removal or separation. Therefore, "decoupled" means "uncoupled" or "separated."  The word's origins trace back to the Old French word "copuler," ultimately from Latin "copulare," meaning "to join together."
