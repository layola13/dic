nonseparability: /ˌnɒnˌsepərəˈbɪləti/ | n. |不可分离性，不可分割性 | The quality or state of being inseparable; the inability to be separated or divided.  It often refers to concepts, relationships, or properties that are intrinsically linked and cannot be treated independently.  For example, in mathematics, a nonseparable space is a topological space that cannot be expressed as the union of two disjoint nonempty open sets. In physics, it might refer to entangled particles whose properties are inherently linked. | Example: The nonseparability of space and time is a fundamental principle of relativity.  不可分离性是相对论的一个基本原理。 The strong nonseparability of the two variables makes it difficult to analyze their individual effects.  这两个变量的强不可分离性使得难以分析它们的个体效应。 | 近义词：indivisibility, inseparability, interconnectedness | 反义词：separability, separateness |  词性: 名词
