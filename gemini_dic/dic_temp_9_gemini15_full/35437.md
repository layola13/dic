co-referential:/ˌkoʊrɪˈfɛrənʃəl/| adj.| 共指的，指称相同的 | Referring to two or more expressions that have the same referent (the thing or person they refer to).  This is a key concept in linguistics and semantics, particularly in the study of discourse and anaphora (referencing back to something previously mentioned).  For example, in the sentence "John saw Mary. He waved to her.", "John" and "He" are co-referential, as are "Mary" and "her". They both refer to the same individual. | Example:  The pronouns "he" and "the man" are co-referential in the sentence "The man smiled; he was happy." =  在句子“那个人笑了；他很快乐”中，代词“他”和“那个人”是共指的。| Near synonyms: synonymous (in some contexts), identical (in reference)| Antonyms: non-referential, unrelated in reference |  N/A
