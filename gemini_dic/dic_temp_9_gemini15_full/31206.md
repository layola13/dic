The word "changs" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (a name, perhaps), or a word from a dialect or specialized vocabulary.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, please double-check the spelling or provide more context.
