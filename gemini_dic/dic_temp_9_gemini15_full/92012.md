hyperotreta: /ˌhaɪpərəˈtriːtə/ | n. | 鳍鳔类 |  A group of extinct, primitive ray-finned fishes characterized by their unique skeletal features and uncertain phylogenetic placement. They are known primarily from fossil remains and represent a significant part of the early evolution of ray-finned fishes.  |  The hyperotreta fossils provide valuable insights into the diversification of early vertebrates. | 近义词:  (lacks direct synonyms due to its taxonomic specificity) | 反义词: (lacks direct antonyms) | 名词


USAGE->
This word, being a taxonomic term referring to an extinct group, doesn't lend itself to typical grammatical usages like the example provided.  The word is used primarily in scientific contexts describing paleontology and the evolutionary history of fish.  It does not take verb conjugations or participate in typical sentence structures outside of descriptive statements.


Example Sentences:

* The discovery of new hyperotreta fossils challenges existing evolutionary models.  = 新发现的鳍鳔类化石挑战了现有的进化模型。

*  Phylogenetic analysis suggests hyperotreta are a sister group to modern ray-finned fishes. = 系统发育分析表明，鳍鳔类是现代辐鳍鱼类的姐妹群。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "hyperotreta."  Phrases would involve broader paleontological or evolutionary terms.  For example:


* "study of hyperotreta morphology" = 鳍鳔类形态学的研究
* "hyperotreta fossil distribution" = 鳍鳔类化石分布
* "evolutionary relationships of hyperotreta" = 鳍鳔类的进化关系
* "the significance of hyperotreta" = 鳍鳔类的意义
* "hyperotreta and early vertebrate evolution" = 鳍鳔类和早期脊椎动物的进化


Note:  The grammatical structures presented in the example are not applicable to this highly specialized scientific term.  Its usage is limited to descriptive and analytical statements within paleontological and evolutionary biology literature.
