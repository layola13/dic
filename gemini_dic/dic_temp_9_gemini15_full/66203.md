It refers to the responsiveness of a cell, tissue, organ, or system to a stimulus.  This responsiveness can be influenced by various factors, including the strength of the stimulus, the frequency of stimulation, and the overall state of the system. | Example: The excitability of neurons is crucial for nerve impulse transmission. 神经元的兴奋性对于神经冲动传递至关重要。The high excitability of the heart muscle can lead to arrhythmias. 心肌的高兴奋性可能导致心律不齐。 |近义词：irritability, responsiveness, sensitivity |反义词：unresponsiveness, insensitivity, inertia |
