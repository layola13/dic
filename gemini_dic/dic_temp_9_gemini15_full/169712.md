词源:

The word "proprieties" originates from the Latin word "proprietas," meaning "one's own," "property," or "peculiar quality."  It evolved through the Old French "propriete" to the English "propriety," and then to its plural form, "proprieties."  The shift in meaning reflects the societal development of codified norms and expectations for behavior.  The connection lies in the idea that proper behavior is seen as a characteristic or quality belonging to those who are well-mannered and socially adept.
