词源:

The word "degradable" is derived from the verb "degrade," meaning to break down or reduce in quality.  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or possibility.  "Degrade" itself comes from the Old French "degrader,"  composed of "de-" (down) and "grader" (to step, to rank).  The meaning evolved to encompass the breaking down of substances, reflecting the progressive reduction in complexity.
