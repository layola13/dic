pseudo-Chilean: /ˈsuːdoʊtʃɪˈliːən/ | adj. | 假冒智利的；冒充智利的 |  Referring to something falsely presented as Chilean, either in origin, style, or character.  This term often implies deception or imitation.  For example, a "pseudo-Chilean" restaurant might serve food that claims to be Chilean but uses ingredients or recipes not authentic to Chilean cuisine.  |  例句：The restaurant's decor was designed to create a pseudo-Chilean atmosphere, but the food was clearly not authentic. = 这家餐厅的装饰旨在营造一种假冒智利的氛围，但食物显然不是正宗的。


The term is a combination of "pseudo-" (meaning false or pretended) and "Chilean" (relating to Chile).  The word "pseudo-" is derived from the Greek word "pseudes" (ψευδής), meaning "false" or "lying."
