词源:
The word "disenter" comes from the Old French word "desentrer," meaning "to un-enter," or "to leave". The prefix "dis-" means "away from" or "apart," and the root "-enter" refers to entering or engaging in something.  Over time, the meaning evolved to also include the sense of disagreeing or rebelling, as well as the medical meaning relating to dysentery.  The medical meaning stems from the fact that dysentery causes severe diarrhea, leading to a forceful expulsion from the body, hence the metaphorical connection.
