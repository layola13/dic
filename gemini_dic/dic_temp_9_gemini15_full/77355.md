词源：

The word "gaudy" ultimately derives from the Middle Dutch word "gaude," meaning "joy" or "festivity."  Over time, its meaning shifted to describe things that were excessively bright and showy, often to the point of being tasteless.  The association with festivity likely contributed to the initial positive connotations, but these were eventually supplanted by negative associations of bad taste.


用法说明：


"Gaudy" is primarily used as an adjective to describe things that are excessively bright, showy, or ornate in a way that is considered tasteless or lacking in refinement.  It often refers to colors, clothing, jewelry, or decorations.  The emphasis is on the excessive nature of the brightness or ornamentation, not simply on brightness itself.  Something can be bright without being gaudy if it possesses good taste and harmony.
