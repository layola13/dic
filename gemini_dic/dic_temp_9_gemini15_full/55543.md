distributivities: /ˌdɪstrɪbjuːˈtɪvɪtiz/ | n. | 分配性；分配率 | The property of an operation that allows it to be distributed over another operation.  For example, multiplication distributes over addition: a(b + c) = ab + ac. This concept is crucial in algebra and other branches of mathematics. | Example: The distributivities of multiplication over addition are fundamental to algebraic manipulation.  分配乘法对加法的分配率是代数运算的基础。|近义词:  distributiveness | 反义词:  N/A
