propepsin:/ˈproʊpɛpsɪn/| n. |胃蛋白酶原|Propepsin is an inactive precursor of pepsin, a digestive enzyme. It is secreted by the chief cells of the stomach and converted to pepsin by the action of hydrochloric acid.  | Example: The chief cells in the stomach lining secrete propepsin, which is then activated to pepsin. 胃粘膜中的主细胞分泌胃蛋白酶原，然后被激活为胃蛋白酶。|近义词:pepsinogen|反义词:pepsin


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Propepsin is secreted by the stomach. = 胃蛋白酶原由胃分泌。
The body produces propepsin to aid digestion. = 人体产生胃蛋白酶原以帮助消化。


一般过去时:
The researchers studied propepsin activation. = 研究人员研究了胃蛋白酶原的激活。
They found high levels of propepsin in the sample. = 他们在样本中发现了高水平的胃蛋白酶原。


现在完成时:

过去完成时:
The experiment had already begun before the propepsin was added. = 在添加胃蛋白酶原之前，实验已经开始了。
Before the discovery, the exact nature of propepsin was unknown. = 在发现之前，胃蛋白酶原的确切性质是未知的。


将来时:
They will study the effects of propepsin on digestion. = 他们将研究胃蛋白酶原对消化的影响。
Further research will explore the potential therapeutic uses of propepsin.  = 进一步的研究将探索胃蛋白酶原的潜在治疗用途。


虚拟语气:
If propepsin were not activated, digestion would be impaired. = 如果胃蛋白酶原不被激活，消化就会受损。

被动语态:
Propepsin is converted to pepsin by hydrochloric acid. = 胃蛋白酶原被盐酸转化为胃蛋白酶。
The activation of propepsin is influenced by several factors. = 胃蛋白酶原的激活受多种因素影响。


疑问句:
What is the role of propepsin in the digestive process? = 胃蛋白酶原在消化过程中起什么作用？
How is propepsin activated in the stomach? = 胃蛋白酶原如何在胃中被激活？


否定句:
Propepsin is not active in its original form. = 胃蛋白酶原在其原始形式下不活跃。
The study did not find any significant differences in propepsin levels. = 该研究没有发现胃蛋白酶原水平的任何显著差异。


PHRASE->
