词源:
The word "refund" comes from the Old French word "refunder," meaning "to found again" or "to restore."  The prefix "re-" indicates repetition or restoration, and the root "-fund" relates to the idea of a foundation or supply of money.  The modern English word evolved through a combination of Old French and Middle English influences.
