schesis:/ˈskiːsɪs/| n. |搁置；停顿；延迟| A figure of speech in which the speaker pauses or delays to create suspense or emphasis.  It's a rhetorical device used to build anticipation or highlight a particular point by strategically interrupting the flow of speech.| Example: "I was about to tell you...  but then I remembered..."  |近义词：pause, suspension, delay |反义词：continuation, immediacy


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in literary analysis and rhetoric, not in everyday conversation.  Therefore, providing examples of grammatical tenses or phrases isn't applicable in the same way as with a common word like "what."  Instead, here are examples demonstrating its usage in different contexts:


Example 1 (Suspense):
"The detective looked at the suspect, his eyes narrowed, a slow, deliberate schesis hanging in the air before he finally spoke..." = 侦探看着嫌疑人，眼睛眯了起来，在最终开口之前，空气中充满了缓慢而刻意的停顿……


Example 2 (Emphasis):
"I will not—I cannot—I refuse to let them win." = 我不会——我不能——我拒绝让他们赢。 (The dashes create a schesis, emphasizing the speaker's refusal.)


Example 3 (Dramatic effect):
"It was a beautiful day, the sun shining brightly, the birds singing sweetly...then, the unthinkable happened." = 那是一个美好的日子，阳光明媚，鸟儿婉转歌唱……然后，不可思议的事情发生了。(The ellipsis and the following sentence create a schesis, heightening the impact of the "unthinkable" event.)


PHRASE->
Since "schesis" itself is not a phrase,  it's not applicable to provide common phrase examples as requested in the template.  However,  phrases that *employ* schesis could be illustrated:

Example 1 (Using ellipsis):
"...and then, silence..." = ……然后，沉默……

Example 2 (Using dashes):
"It was—unexpected." = 这真是——出乎意料。

Example 3 (Using a pause):
"I...think...I understand now." = 我……认为……我现在明白了。
