词源:
The word "instilling" comes from the Old French word "instiller," which itself is derived from the Latin word "instillare."  "In-" means "in" or "into," and "stillare" means "to drop," "to drip," or "to pour."  The original meaning referred to the physical act of dripping a liquid, but it evolved to encompass the metaphorical sense of gradually introducing an idea or feeling.
