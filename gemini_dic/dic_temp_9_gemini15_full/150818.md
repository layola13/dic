It plays a crucial role in peripheral vision and contributes to overall visual perception.  | Example: Studies have shown that the parafovea processes visual information in parallel with the fovea, contributing to efficient scene understanding.  旁中央凹区研究表明，旁中央凹区与中央凹区并行处理视觉信息，有助于高效的场景理解。|近义词:perifoveal area|反义词:fovea
