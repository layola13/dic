The word "hendy" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested is not possible.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (a name, for example), a slang term, or a word from a very specialized field.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), a more accurate analysis might be possible.
