词源：
The word "scout" comes from the Middle English word "scouten," meaning "to watch,"  which itself likely comes from a Dutch word with similar meaning. The use of "scout" to refer to a person who explores or searches developed over time.  The Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts organizations further popularized the word and its associated imagery.
