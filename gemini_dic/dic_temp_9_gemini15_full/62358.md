The word "endiaper" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information following the requested format.  It may be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specialized or archaic dialect, or a proper noun.  More context is needed to understand its intended meaning.
