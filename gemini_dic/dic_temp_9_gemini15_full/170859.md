pseudohalter: /ˈsuːdoʊˌhɔːltər/ | n. | 假翅缰 |  A pseudohalter is a modified wing in some flies (Diptera) that resembles a halter but has a different evolutionary origin. Unlike true halteres, which are derived from the hindwings, pseudohalters are believed to have evolved from the forewings. They are typically small, club-shaped structures that are involved in balance and flight control.  |  The fruit fly *Drosophila* exhibits pseudohalters. | 近义词: (None, as it's a specific entomological term) | 反义词: halter (in the context of evolutionary origin) | 名词
