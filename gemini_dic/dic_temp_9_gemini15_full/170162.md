protoorganism:/ˌproʊtoʊˈɔːrɡənɪzəm/| n. |原生物，原始生物|A hypothetical very early form of life from which all other organisms are descended; a simple, self-replicating entity that existed before the last universal common ancestor (LUCA).  Proto-organisms are thought to have been very simple, lacking the complex cellular structures of modern organisms.  The exact nature of proto-organisms remains a topic of scientific debate and research.|Example:  The origin of life is a complex process, and the study of proto-organisms helps us understand the early stages of evolution.  = 生命起源是一个复杂的过程，对原生物的研究有助于我们了解进化的早期阶段。|近义词：primordial organism, early life form|反义词：complex organism, advanced life form


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Scientists study proto-organisms to understand the origin of life. = 科学家研究原生物以了解生命起源。
The research focuses on the characteristics of proto-organisms. = 这项研究的重点是原生物的特征。


一般过去时:
Researchers hypothesized about the structure of proto-organisms. = 研究人员假设了原生物的结构。
Scientists discovered evidence of early proto-organisms. = 科学家发现了早期原生物的证据。


现在完成时:
Scientists have proposed several models for proto-organism evolution. = 科学家已经提出了几种原生物进化模型。
Researchers have found fossils suggesting the existence of proto-organisms. = 研究人员发现了暗示原生物存在的化石。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, scientists had debated the nature of proto-organisms. = 在发现之前，科学家们一直在争论原生物的性质。
They had already studied similar simple life forms before focusing on proto-organisms. = 在专注于原生物之前，他们已经研究过类似的简单生命形式。


将来时:
Scientists will continue to investigate the properties of proto-organisms. = 科学家将继续研究原生物的特性。
Future research will likely reveal more about proto-organisms. = 未来的研究可能会揭示更多关于原生物的信息。


虚拟语气:
If we understood proto-organisms better, we could better understand the origin of life. = 如果我们更好地理解原生物，我们就能更好地理解生命起源。
It is hypothesized that if proto-organisms hadn't developed, life as we know it wouldn't exist. = 假设如果原生物没有进化，我们所知的生命就不会存在。


被动语态:
Proto-organisms are believed to have been very simple. = 人们认为原生物非常简单。
Many theories about proto-organisms are being tested. = 许多关于原生物的理论正在被检验。


疑问句:
What were the defining characteristics of proto-organisms? = 原生物的决定性特征是什么？
How did proto-organisms reproduce? = 原生物是如何繁殖的？


否定句:
Proto-organisms were not as complex as modern cells. = 原生物不像现代细胞那样复杂。
Scientists do not yet fully understand the evolution of proto-organisms. = 科学家们尚未完全了解原生物的进化。


PHRASE->
the evolution of proto-organisms = 原生物的进化
the characteristics of proto-organisms = 原生物的特征
the origin of proto-organisms = 原生物的起源
the structure of proto-organisms = 原生物的结构
research on proto-organisms = 原生物的研究
