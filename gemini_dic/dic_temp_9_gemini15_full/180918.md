reification:/ˌriːɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/| n. |化体；实体化；客观化；具体化 |The process of treating something abstract as if it were concrete or material.  It involves giving a tangible form to something that is essentially intangible, such as an idea, concept, or quality. This can lead to a misunderstanding or misrepresentation of the original abstract entity. |Example: The reification of social class often leads to prejudice and discrimination.  社会阶级的实体化往往导致偏见和歧视。


Example: The reification of "intelligence" as a single, measurable quality ignores the complexity of human cognitive abilities. 将“智力”实体化为单一、可衡量的品质忽略了人类认知能力的复杂性。
