词源:

The word "guarantee" comes from the Old French word "garantir," meaning "to warrant," "to give security," or "to protect." This, in turn, is derived from the Germanic root "war," meaning "to protect" or "to defend."  The suffix "-ir" is a common verb-forming suffix in Old French.  The word's evolution reflects a consistent semantic core focusing on the assurance of protection or security.
