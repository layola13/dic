词源:
The word "noncongealing" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the present participle "congealing" (from the verb "congeal," meaning "to solidify or coagulate").  The verb "congeal" ultimately derives from the Old French word "congeler," which in turn comes from the Latin "congelare," meaning "to freeze together."
