词源:

The word is formed by combining "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great extent) with "persecuted" (past participle of persecute).  "Persecute" comes from the Latin "persequi," meaning "to follow up, pursue, prosecute."  Therefore, "overpersecuted" literally means "excessively pursued or harassed."
