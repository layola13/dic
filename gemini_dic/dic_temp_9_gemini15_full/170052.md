proteose:/ˈproʊtiˌoʊs/| n. | 蛋白胨 | Proteose is a group of intermediate products formed during the hydrolysis of proteins. They are less complex than proteins but more complex than peptones. Proteoses are soluble in water, and they are precipitated by certain salts, such as ammonium sulfate.  They are also coagulated by heat. They are important in digestion as they are further broken down into smaller peptides and amino acids. |  The experiment showed that the proteose concentration increased during digestion.  实验表明，消化过程中蛋白胨浓度增加。|  peptone, polypeptide |  protein (in its complete form) |  noun
