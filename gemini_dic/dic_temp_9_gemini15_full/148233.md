词源:
The word "oversimplifications" is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessive"), the noun "simplification" (the act of making something simpler), and the plural suffix "-tions".  "Simplification" itself comes from the verb "simplify," derived from the Latin word "simplex" (simple).
