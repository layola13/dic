coculturing:/ˈkoʊkʌltʃərɪŋ/| n. |共培养；混合培养|The process of growing two or more different cell types or organisms together in the same culture medium.  This technique is used extensively in cell biology, microbiology, and other biological fields to study cell-cell interactions, synergistic effects, or the impact of one organism on another. |Example:  Coculturing of neurons and glial cells revealed important interactions in neuronal development. 共培养神经元和神经胶质细胞揭示了神经元发育中的重要相互作用。|近义词:mixed culture, combined culture|反义词: monoculture
