cotransduced:/ˌkoʊtrænsˈdjuːst/| adj.| 共同转导的 |  Describes genes or genetic material that are transferred together during transduction, a process where genetic material is transferred from one bacterium to another by a bacteriophage (virus). This happens because the genes are located close together on the bacterial chromosome. | Example: The cotransduced genes were found to be involved in antibiotic resistance. 共同转导的基因被发现参与了抗生素耐药性。 | 近义词：co-transferred | 反义词：not cotransduced


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The experiment shows that these genes are cotransduced. = 实验表明这些基因是共同转导的。
Researchers are studying the frequency of cotransduction. = 研究人员正在研究共同转导的频率。


一般过去时:
The genes were cotransduced in the previous experiment. = 在之前的实验中，这些基因是共同转导的。
Scientists observed that the two markers were cotransduced. = 科学家观察到这两个标记是共同转导的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have found many examples of cotransduced genes. = 科学家已经发现了许多共同转导基因的例子。
Researchers have determined that the cotransduction frequency is related to distance. = 研究人员已经确定共同转导频率与距离有关。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had hypothesized that the genes would be cotransduced. = 在实验之前，他们假设这些基因将会被共同转导。
It had been previously shown that the genes were frequently cotransduced. = 此前已证明这些基因经常被共同转导。


将来时:
We will investigate whether these genes will be cotransduced. = 我们将调查这些基因是否会共同转导。
The results will show whether the genes are cotransduced or not. = 结果将显示这些基因是否共同转导。


虚拟语气:
If the genes were closer, they would be more likely to be cotransduced. = 如果基因更靠近，它们就更有可能被共同转导。
It would be helpful if we knew the rate of cotransduction. = 如果我们知道共同转导的速率，将会有所帮助。


被动语态:
The genes were cotransduced during phage infection. = 这些基因在噬菌体感染期间被共同转导。
The cotransduction frequency was determined using statistical methods. = 共同转导频率是使用统计方法确定的。


疑问句:
Are these genes cotransduced? = 这些基因是共同转导的吗？
What is the rate of cotransduction in this system? = 在这个系统中，共同转导的速率是多少？


否定句:
The genes were not cotransduced in this instance. = 在这种情况下，这些基因没有共同转导。
The results did not indicate that the genes were cotransduced. = 结果没有表明这些基因是共同转导的。
