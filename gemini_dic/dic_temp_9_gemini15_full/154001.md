词源:  The word "perforata" is the feminine singular form of the Latin past participle of "perforare," meaning "to pierce," "to bore through," or "to perforate."  The suffix "-ata" indicates a feminine past participle.  Therefore, "perforata" literally means "pierced" or "perforated" (in the feminine sense).
