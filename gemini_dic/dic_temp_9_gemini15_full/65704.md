evented:/ɪˈvɛntɪd/ | adj. | 事件驱动的，基于事件的 |  Relating to or characterized by events; driven by events.  This term is often used in the context of software architecture and programming, referring to systems that react to events rather than following a predetermined sequence of instructions. | Example: The evented architecture allows for real-time responses to user actions.  事件驱动的架构允许对用户操作做出实时响应。 | 近义词：event-driven, event-based | 反义词： procedural, synchronous


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The system is evented; it reacts to user clicks. = 系统是事件驱动的；它对用户的点击做出反应。
This application uses an evented model. = 此应用程序使用事件驱动模型。


一般过去时:
The game was evented, making it responsive. = 游戏是事件驱动的，使其具有响应性。
The previous version wasn't evented; it was synchronous. =  之前的版本不是事件驱动的；它是同步的。


现在完成时:
They have implemented an evented system. = 他们已经实现了事件驱动系统。
The framework has been updated to support evented programming. = 该框架已更新为支持事件驱动编程。


过去完成时:
Before the upgrade, the application hadn't been evented. = 在升级之前，应用程序不是事件驱动的。
They had already decided to use an evented architecture. = 他们已经决定使用事件驱动架构。


将来时:
We will use an evented approach for the new project. = 我们将在新项目中使用事件驱动的方法。
The next version will be fully evented. = 下一个版本将完全是事件驱动的。


虚拟语气:
If the system were evented, it would be more responsive. = 如果系统是事件驱动的，它将更具响应性。
I wish the library supported evented programming. = 我希望该库支持事件驱动编程。


被动语态:
The process is being managed by an evented system. = 该过程由事件驱动系统管理。
An evented framework was chosen for the application. = 为该应用程序选择了事件驱动框架。


疑问句:
Is the application evented? = 该应用程序是事件驱动的吗？
Is this a truly evented architecture? = 这真的是事件驱动架构吗？


否定句:
The old system wasn't evented. = 旧系统不是事件驱动的。
This approach is not evented; it's polling-based. = 此方法不是事件驱动的；它是基于轮询的。



PHRASE->
evented architecture = 事件驱动架构
evented programming = 事件驱动编程
evented system = 事件驱动系统
fully evented = 完全事件驱动
evented I/O = 事件驱动I/O
