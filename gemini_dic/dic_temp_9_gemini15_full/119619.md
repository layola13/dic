The word "middest" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a very rare, archaic, or dialectal word.  The intended word might be "midst," "middle," or "middling."  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis as requested in the format.
