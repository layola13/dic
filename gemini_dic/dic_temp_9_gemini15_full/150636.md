papillulate:/pəˈpɪljuleɪt/| adj.| 具乳突的；有乳头状突起的 | Covered with small nipple-like projections.  The surface is papillulate, giving it a slightly rough texture.  |近义词：papillose, tuberculate |反义词：smooth, glabrous


The word "papillulate" describes a surface that is covered in small, nipple-like projections called papillae.  It's derived from the Latin word "papilla," meaning "nipple" or "small protuberance." The suffix "-ulate" indicates a diminutive or somewhat reduced form. Therefore, papillulate suggests a surface with many small, nipple-like bumps, rather than large, prominent ones.
