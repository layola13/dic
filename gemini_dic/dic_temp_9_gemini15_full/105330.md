词源:
The term "kick-ass" is a colloquialism, a combination of "kick" (meaning to be powerful or effective) and "ass" (a vulgar term for the buttocks, here used for emphasis).  The exact origin is difficult to pinpoint, but its usage became prevalent in the late 20th century, particularly within youth and counter-culture contexts.  The phrase initially held a more aggressive connotation, but its meaning has softened over time to primarily denote excellence.
