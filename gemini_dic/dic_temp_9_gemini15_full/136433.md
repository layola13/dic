PHRASE->
There is no phrase specifically using "nonrevelation" as a core component.  The word itself functions as a standalone noun. However, phrases like "the act of nonrevelation", "a policy of nonrevelation", or "instances of nonrevelation" are possible and grammatically correct.


词源:
The word "nonrevelation" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "revelation" (the act of revealing something).  Therefore, it directly signifies "not a revelation" or "the absence of revelation."
