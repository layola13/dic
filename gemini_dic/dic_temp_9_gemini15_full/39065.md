conformers:/kənˈfɔːrmərz/| n. |构象异构体，顺从者|Molecules that have the same molecular formula and connectivity but different three-dimensional structures are called conformers.  Conformers arise from rotations around single bonds.

The conformers of butane have different energies. 丁烷的不同构象异构体具有不同的能量。|近义词：isomers (but with important distinctions), rotamers|反义词：无
