effectuous:/ɪˈfɛktʃuəs/ | adj. |有效的；奏效的 | Producing the intended effect; successful.  The effectuous plan quickly resolved the crisis.  |近义词：effective, efficacious, successful |反义词：ineffective, unsuccessful, futile


The word "effectuous" is quite rare in modern English.  While dictionaries list it, its usage is largely archaic or obsolete.  It's essentially a synonym for "effective" but carries a slightly stronger connotation of producing a desired result through skillful or clever means.


词源:

The word derives from the Old French "effectif," meaning "effective," which itself comes from the Latin "effectus," the past participle of "efficere," meaning "to bring about," "to accomplish," or "to effect."


用法说明:

Due to its rarity, there are limited examples of "effectuous" in contemporary usage.  It's more likely to be found in older texts.  It functions as an adjective modifying nouns that describe actions, plans, or methods.


例句:

His effectuous speech persuaded the audience. = 他有效的演讲说服了听众。

The effectuous remedy quickly cured the illness. =有效的治疗很快治愈了疾病。


由于这个词的罕见性，提供更多例句和不同时态的例句是不现实的。  这个词在现代英语中几乎不使用。
