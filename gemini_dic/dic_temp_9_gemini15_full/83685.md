词源:
The word "haggardness" derives from the adjective "haggard," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "hagard," meaning "wild, untamed."  This original sense likely referred to the wild, gaunt appearance of a hawk that had not been properly cared for. Over time, the meaning shifted to describe the appearance of a person who is exhausted and worn down, reflecting a similar state of neglect and hardship.
