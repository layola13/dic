词源:
The word "dysentery" comes from the Medieval Latin word *dysenteria*, which itself is derived from the Greek words *dys-* (meaning "bad" or "difficult") and *enteron* (meaning "intestine").  Therefore, the word literally means "bad intestine" or "difficult intestine," accurately reflecting the painful and debilitating nature of the disease.
