词源:

The word "disgracious" comes from the Old French word "desgracieux," which is a combination of the prefix "des-" (meaning "without" or "deprived of") and "gracieux" (meaning "graceful," "pleasing," or "thankful").  The Old French word ultimately derives from the Latin word "gratia," meaning "grace," "favor," or "thanks."  Therefore, "disgracious" literally means "without grace" or "lacking grace."
