词源:
The word "gouger" originates from the verb "gouge," which comes from the Middle English word "gougen," meaning "to dig or scoop out." This, in turn, is likely derived from a Proto-Germanic root.  The sense of "overcharging" developed later, stemming from the image of someone digging deep into someone's pockets to extract money unfairly.
