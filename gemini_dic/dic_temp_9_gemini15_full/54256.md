词源:

* **dis-**:  A prefix meaning "opposite of," "not," or "removal of."
* **grace**:  From Old French *grace*, ultimately from Latin *gratia*, meaning "favor," "thankfulness," "pleasing manner."  It carries connotations of elegance, charm, and favor.
* **-fully**: A suffix meaning "in a ... manner" or "to a great extent."

Therefore, "disgracefully" literally means "in a manner lacking grace" or "in a shameful manner."  The word combines the negative prefix "dis-" with the concept of "grace" to create a word indicating shameful or dishonorable behavior.
