havala:/həˈvɑːlə/| n. |哈瓦拉, 非正式资金转移系统 |A hawala is an informal value transfer system based on trust and the honour of the parties involved.  It's often used in regions with underdeveloped or unstable financial systems, or where formal banking is difficult or costly.  The system relies on a network of hawala brokers who settle debts between each other, avoiding the formal banking system.  Transactions are often conducted without documentation or the transfer of physical money.  While it can be convenient and efficient, it also poses risks due to its lack of regulation and potential for use in illegal activities.  | Example:  The money was transferred through a hawala system, bypassing traditional banking channels.  哈瓦拉系统转账，绕过了传统的银行渠道。 |近义词:  money transfer, remittance, informal transfer |反义词: formal banking system
