词源:

Derived from the adjective "purgative," which originates from the Latin word "purgativus," meaning "cleansing" or "purifying."  This in turn comes from the verb "purgo," meaning "to cleanse," "to purify," or "to purge." The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner or way in which something is done.


用法说明:

The adverb "purgatively" is primarily used in a medical or physiological context, describing the action of something that induces purging or cleansing, typically of the bowels.  It is less common in everyday language than the adjective "purgative."
