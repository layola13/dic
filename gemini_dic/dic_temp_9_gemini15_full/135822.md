The word "nonpromulgations" is a relatively rare word formed by adding the prefix "non-" to the noun "promulgations".  Let's break down its components:

* **non-**: This is a prefix meaning "not" or "absence of".

* **promulgation**: This noun refers to the act of promoting or making something known publicly, especially a law or doctrine.  It comes from the Latin word "promulgare," which is composed of:

    * **pro-**:  meaning "forward" or "forth"
    * **mulgare**: meaning "to make public" or "to publish"


Therefore, "nonpromulgations" refers to instances where something is *not* made public, *not* officially announced, or *not* put into effect.  It highlights the absence of public announcement or dissemination.


The word is primarily used in formal contexts, often in legal or academic writing, where the precise absence of public dissemination is crucial.  There aren't common everyday usages.  Its meaning relies heavily on context.  For example, it might be used to describe:

* **Secret government decisions:**  The number of nonpromulgations in national security matters is often high.  (国家安全事务中未公布的决定数量通常很高。)

* **Withheld research findings:** The study raised concerns about potential nonpromulgations of negative research results. (这项研究引发了对可能未公布负面研究结果的担忧。)

* **Unpublished laws or regulations:** A lack of transparency is evidenced by the high number of nonpromulgations within the regulatory body. (监管机构中大量未公布的法规和条例证明了缺乏透明度。)


Because of its rarity, providing examples across various grammatical tenses is impractical.  The word functions primarily as a noun, and its use would generally remain within the same tense throughout a sentence or paragraph.  The grammatical constructions used would be similar to those used with other nouns.  For instance:

* **Singular:** The single nonpromulgation was noted by the oversight committee. (监督委员会注意到这唯一一起未公布的情况。)

* **Plural:** Several nonpromulgations were discovered during the audit. (审计过程中发现了多起未公布的情况。)

* **Possessive:** The government's nonpromulgations were questioned by the press. (政府的未公布行为受到了媒体的质疑。)

* **As object of a preposition:** The reason for the nonpromulgations remains unclear. (未公布的原因仍不清楚。)


The lack of common usage also makes it difficult to provide common phrases. The word itself is the core concept, and any phrases would simply be built around the concept of things *not* being promulgated.
