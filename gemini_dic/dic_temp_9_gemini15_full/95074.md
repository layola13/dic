词源:

The word "inadvisablenesses" is derived from the adjective "inadvisable," which itself is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the adjective "advisable" (meaning "wise, prudent, or recommendable"), and the suffix "-nesses" (a pluralizing suffix indicating multiple instances or qualities).  "Advisable" ultimately stems from the verb "advise," originating from Old French "avisier" (to consider, think about), from "avis" (opinion, advice), and ultimately from Latin "avis" (bird; hence, omen, divination; opinion).  The "-nesses" suffix transforms the single quality of "inadvisability" into multiple instances or aspects of inadvisability.
