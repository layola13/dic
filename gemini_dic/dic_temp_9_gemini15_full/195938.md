sensitizers:/ˈsɛnsɪtaɪzərz/| n.|致敏剂，敏化剂|A sensitizer is a substance that can cause an allergic reaction in some people.

Sensitizers often work by altering the immune system, making it overreact to subsequent exposures.|Example:  Many perfumes contain sensitizers that can cause skin rashes in susceptible individuals.  许多香水含有致敏剂，会引起易感个体皮肤皮疹。

Some plants contain sensitizers that can trigger allergic contact dermatitis. 一些植物含有致敏剂，会引发过敏性接触性皮炎。|近义词：allergen, irritant|反义词：desensitizer
