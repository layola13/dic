词源:

The word "preeminently" derives from the adjective "preeminent," which is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in front of") and the adjective "eminent" (meaning "standing out; prominent; distinguished").  "Eminent" itself comes from the Latin word "eminere," meaning "to stand out" or "project."  Therefore, "preeminently" signifies something that stands out above others, surpasses them, or is foremost.
