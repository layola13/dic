The word "{properispome}" does not exist in English.  There is no entry for it in any major dictionary or etymology resource.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a fictional language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  To get a proper analysis, please provide a correctly spelled word.
