magnetomotive:/ˌmæɡnɪtoʊˈmoʊtɪv/| adj. |磁动力的；产生磁动力的|  Magnetomotive force is the driving force that produces a magnetic field. It's analogous to electromotive force (EMF) in electrical circuits.  |The magnetomotive force of the electromagnet was sufficient to lift the heavy weight.  磁电机的磁动势足以举起重物。| electromotive, magnetic|  non-magnetic|  adj.
