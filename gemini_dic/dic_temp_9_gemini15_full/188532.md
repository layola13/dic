词源:
The word "rugged" ultimately derives from the Old Norse word *rugga, meaning "to shake" or "to rock."  Over time, this evolved to describe something rough or uneven, and eventually to describe a person or thing as strong and resilient.  The superlative form "ruggedest" simply adds the superlative suffix "-est" to intensify the meaning.
