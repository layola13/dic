词源:
The word "competition" comes from the Latin word "conpetitio," which is formed from the prefix "com-" (meaning "together") and the verb "petere" (meaning "to strive for" or "to seek").  Therefore, the original meaning points to a shared striving for something.  The word evolved through Old French "conpeticioun" before entering English.
