The term "fast-track" emerged in the mid-20th century, combining "fast" (meaning rapid or quick) and "track" (referring to a path or course of action). The original meaning was likely related to railway tracks, emphasizing speed and directness.  Its use expanded to describe any process or system that accelerates progress.
