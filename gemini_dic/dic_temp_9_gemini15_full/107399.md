laminary:/ˈlæmɪnəri/| adj.|层状的，层流的|relating to or denoting a smooth, regular flow of a fluid, in which the molecules move in parallel layers with no disruption between the layers.|The laminar flow of the water allowed for a clear view of the riverbed. 层状的水流使得河床清晰可见。|turbulent|turbulent|


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The water flows in a laminar stream. = 水以层流的形式流动。
This experiment demonstrates laminar flow. = 这个实验演示了层流。


一般过去时:
The airflow was laminar during the test. = 测试期间气流是层状的。
The scientist observed laminar flow in the pipe. = 科学家观察到管道内的层流。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied laminar flow for centuries. = 科学家们已经研究层流几个世纪了。
The engineers have ensured laminar flow in the system. = 工程师们确保了系统中的层流。


过去完成时:
The experiment had shown laminar flow before the pressure increased. = 在压力增加之前，实验已经显示出层流。
The researchers had observed laminar flow in previous studies. = 研究人员在之前的研究中已经观察到层流。


将来时:
The new design will promote laminar flow. = 新的设计将促进层流。
We will investigate laminar flow in different fluids. = 我们将研究不同流体中的层流。


虚拟语气:
If the fluid were less viscous, the flow would be laminar. = 如果流体粘度较低，则流动将是层流。
I wish the flow were laminar for better data collection. = 我希望流动是层流，以便更好地收集数据。


被动语态:
Laminar flow is often studied in fluid dynamics. = 层流经常在流体动力学中被研究。
The conditions for laminar flow were carefully controlled. = 层流的条件得到了仔细控制。


疑问句:
Is the flow laminar or turbulent? = 流动是层流还是湍流？
Under what conditions is laminar flow maintained? = 在什么条件下保持层流？


否定句:
The flow was not laminar; it was turbulent. = 流动不是层流，而是湍流。
The experiment did not produce laminar flow as expected. = 实验没有像预期那样产生层流。


PHRASE->
Laminar boundary layer = 层流边界层
Laminar shear stress = 层流剪应力
Laminar flame speed = 层流火焰速度
Laminar flow control = 层流控制
Laminar mixing = 层流混合
