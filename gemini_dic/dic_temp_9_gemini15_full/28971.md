词源：

The word "carryovers" is a compound word formed from "carry" and "over."  "Carry" originates from Old English *cerran, meaning "to turn," which evolved to encompass the meaning of "to transport" or "to continue." The preposition "over" indicates the transfer or continuation across a boundary or period.  Therefore, "carryovers" literally means things that are "carried over" from one time period to another.
