/ˈhaɪdroʊsɔːlt/ | n. |水盐；水合物盐|A hydrosalt is a salt that contains water molecules within its crystal structure.  It is often formed when a salt crystallizes from an aqueous solution, incorporating water molecules into its lattice.  Hydrosalts are also known as hydrated salts.  The water molecules are usually weakly bound and can be removed by heating, a process known as dehydration. |Example: Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO₄·5H₂O) is a common example of a hydrosalt.  This blue crystalline solid contains five water molecules per formula unit.  Upon heating, it loses the water molecules and turns white.|近义词：hydrated salt|反义词：anhydrous salt|
