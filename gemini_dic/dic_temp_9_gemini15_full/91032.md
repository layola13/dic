词源:
The word "husky"  ultimately derives from the Old Norse word "huska," meaning "hoarse" or "rough."  This reflects its primary meaning of a hoarse or raspy voice. The secondary meaning of "strong" and "powerful" developed later, likely due to an association between a strong voice and a strong physique.  The connection between the two meanings isn't etymologically direct, but rather semantic drift based on common observation.
