词源:

The word "graspingness" is derived from the verb "grasp," which comes from Old English *graspian, meaning "to seize, grip." The suffix "-ingness" transforms the verb into a noun, indicating a state, quality, or condition.  The evolution reflects a semantic shift from the literal act of seizing to the figurative sense of greedily acquiring.
