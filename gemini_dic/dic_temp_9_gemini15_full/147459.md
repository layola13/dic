/ˌoʊvərəˈfɛnsɪvnəsɪz/ | n. |过度冒犯性；过分冒犯的行为|The word "overoffensivenesses" is not a standard English word.  It's a non-standard formation, likely created by adding "-nesses" (a pluralizing suffix for abstract nouns) to "overoffensiveness," which itself is already a somewhat awkward combination of "over" and "offensiveness."  The intended meaning is likely to refer to multiple instances of excessive offense or extremely offensive acts.  However, due to its artificial construction, it lacks common usage and should be avoided in formal writing. A more appropriate term would be "excessive offenses" or "highly offensive acts."|例句：There is no standard example sentence because this word is not a standard word.  Instead, consider: "His actions constituted a series of excessive offenses." = 他的行为构成了一系列过分的冒犯。|近义词：excessive offenses, highly offensive acts, multiple instances of offensiveness|反义词：acts of kindness, compliments, polite gestures |名词
