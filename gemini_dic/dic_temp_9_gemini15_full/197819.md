The word "shinkoku" is not an English word.  It appears to be a transliteration of a Japanese word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, etymology, or usage examples in the requested format as it applies to English words.  To analyze this word, I need more context.  Is it a proper noun, a common noun, a verb, or something else?  Knowing the original Japanese word and its meaning would allow me to provide a more accurate and helpful response.
