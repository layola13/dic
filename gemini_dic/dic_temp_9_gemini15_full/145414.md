词源:

The word "overcentralizes" is formed from the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively"), the noun "center" (meaning "the middle point or central part"), and the suffix "-alize" (meaning "to make or become").  "Center" itself has roots in Latin ("centrum").  The "-ize" suffix is of Greek origin. Therefore, the word signifies the act of excessively concentrating power or function in a central location or authority.
