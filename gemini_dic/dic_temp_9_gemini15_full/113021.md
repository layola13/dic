lumen:/ˈluːmən/| n.|流明；光通量|A lumen (symbol: lm) is the SI derived unit of luminous flux, a measure of the total amount of visible light emitted by a source.  It's a measure of perceived power, weighted to match the sensitivity of the human eye.  One lumen is the amount of light emitted by a source of one candela (cd) intensity into one steradian (sr) solid angle. |The lamp has a lumen output of 1000 lumens. 这盏灯的光通量为1000流明。

The brightness of a screen is often measured in lumens per square meter (lm/m²), also known as nits. 屏幕的亮度通常以流明每平方米 (lm/m²)，也称为尼特来衡量。|近义词：luminous flux|反义词：None
