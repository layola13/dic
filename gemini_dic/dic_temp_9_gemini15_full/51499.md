词源:
The word "detractory" is derived from the verb "detract," which comes from the Latin prefix "de-" (meaning "away from" or "down from") and the verb "trahere" (meaning "to draw" or "to pull").  Therefore, "detract" literally means "to draw away from" or "to diminish."  The suffix "-ory" forms adjectives, meaning "tending to" or "relating to."  Thus, "detractory" signifies something that tends to draw away from or diminish something's value or importance.
