词源:  The word "canelé" is derived from the Gascon word *canelat*, meaning "grooved" or "fluted," referring to the characteristic ridged shape of the pastry.  The word ultimately has Latin origins, likely related to words meaning "channel" or "groove."


用法说明:

Canelé is almost exclusively used as a noun referring to the specific French pastry.  There are no verb or adjective forms in common usage.  It's primarily used in the singular or plural ("canelé" or "canelés").  It's rarely used in any grammatical tense other than the simple present (e.g., "These are delicious canelés").

由于canelé本身是名词，因此不适用动词、形容词等词性变化及相应例句，也不涉及时态变化。
