词源:

The word "receivership" is derived from "receiver," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "recevoir," meaning "to receive."  The "-ship" suffix indicates a state, condition, or office.  In the context of receivership, the "receiver" is an individual appointed by a court to manage the assets of a bankrupt entity.
