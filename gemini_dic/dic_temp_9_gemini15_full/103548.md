词源:
The word "jog" ultimately derives from Old Norse "jok", meaning "yoke".  The sense of a "yoke" as something that causes a slight jolt or uneven movement led to the development of the meaning of "jog" as a slight push or shake.  The meaning of "jog" as a slow run evolved later, likely from the image of a horse moving at a slow, steady pace, similar to the uneven gait caused by a yoke.
