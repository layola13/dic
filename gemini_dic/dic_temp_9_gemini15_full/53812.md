disconformity:/dɪskənˈfɔːrməti/ | n. |不整合面；不整合| An unconformity is a break in the geologic record where there is a significant gap in time between the layers of rock.  This means that some layers of rock are missing, and there is a period of erosion or non-deposition between the existing layers. A disconformity is a type of unconformity where the layers above and below the unconformity are parallel, but there is a significant time gap between them. This often occurs due to a period of erosion or non-deposition where older, horizontal sedimentary layers were exposed to weathering and erosion before younger sediments were deposited on top. | The Grand Canyon displays many disconformities, showcasing millions of years of missing geological history. | 近义词：unconformity, hiatus | 反义词：conformity, continuity
