/ˈfoʊniːm/| n. |音位|A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound in a language that distinguishes one word from another.  Phonemes are abstract units; they are not the sounds themselves but rather the mental representations of sounds. For example, /p/ and /b/ are different phonemes in English because they can distinguish words like "pat" and "bat".
