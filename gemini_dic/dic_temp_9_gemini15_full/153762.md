pepsines:/ˈpɛpsɪnz/| n. |胃蛋白酶|A group of enzymes that break down proteins in the stomach.  Pepsin is secreted by chief cells in the stomach lining and is most active in an acidic environment. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of peptide bonds, breaking down proteins into smaller peptides.|The stomach secretes pepsins to aid in protein digestion. 胃分泌胃蛋白酶以帮助蛋白质消化。|proteases, proteinases|none|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Pepsin breaks down proteins in the stomach. = 胃蛋白酶分解胃中的蛋白质。
The stomach secretes pepsins to aid digestion. = 胃分泌胃蛋白酶以帮助消化。


一般过去时:
The experiment showed that pepsin digested the protein sample. = 实验表明胃蛋白酶消化了蛋白质样本。
Researchers studied how pepsins functioned in different pH levels. = 研究人员研究了胃蛋白酶在不同pH值下的功能。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered many variations of pepsin. = 科学家们已经发现了许多胃蛋白酶的变体。
The patient has experienced digestive issues due to low pepsin levels. = 患者由于胃蛋白酶水平低而出现消化问题。


过去完成时:
Before the meal, the stomach had already started secreting pepsins. = 饭前，胃已经开始分泌胃蛋白酶了。
The study had shown that pepsin activity decreased at high pH. = 研究表明，在高pH值下，胃蛋白酶活性下降。


将来时:
Researchers will investigate the role of pepsins in various diseases. = 研究人员将调查胃蛋白酶在各种疾病中的作用。
The new drug will increase pepsin production in the stomach. = 新药将增加胃中胃蛋白酶的产生。


虚拟语气:
If the stomach lacked pepsins, protein digestion would be impaired. = 如果胃缺乏胃蛋白酶，蛋白质消化就会受损。
I wish I had known the importance of pepsins for digestion earlier. = 我真希望我早点知道胃蛋白酶对消化的重要性。


被动语态:
Proteins are broken down by pepsins in the stomach. = 蛋白质在胃中被胃蛋白酶分解。
Pepsin production is regulated by various hormones. = 胃蛋白酶的产生受多种激素调节。


疑问句:
What is the optimal pH for pepsin activity? = 胃蛋白酶活性的最佳pH值是多少？
How do pepsins contribute to overall digestion? = 胃蛋白酶如何促进整体消化？


否定句:
The patient did not have sufficient levels of pepsins. = 患者的胃蛋白酶水平不足。
The experiment did not show any significant effect of the drug on pepsin production. = 实验没有显示该药物对胃蛋白酶产生的任何显著影响。
