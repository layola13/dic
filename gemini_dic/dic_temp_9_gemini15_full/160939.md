post-precipitate: /ˌpoʊst prɪˈsɪpɪteɪt/ | n. | 后沉淀物 | A precipitate formed after the initial precipitation.  It refers to a solid that separates from a solution after the primary precipitation has occurred. This often happens due to changes in temperature, pH, or concentration. | Example: The post-precipitate formed after the solution cooled was analyzed separately.  后沉淀物在溶液冷却后形成，并被单独分析。| 近义词: secondary precipitate, subsequent precipitate | 反义词: primary precipitate, initial precipitate | 名词


USAGE->

虚拟语气:
If the solution were more acidic, a different post-precipitate might form. = 如果溶液更酸性，可能会形成不同的后沉淀物。
