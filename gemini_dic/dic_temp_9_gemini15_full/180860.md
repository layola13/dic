rehibitory: /rɪˈhɪbɪtəri/ | adj. | 禁止的；抑制的 | Inhibitory refers to something that inhibits or restrains an action, process, or function.  It often describes substances or mechanisms that prevent or reduce activity. | Example:  The drug has inhibitory effects on nerve impulses.  这种药物对神经冲动有抑制作用。


The inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA reduces neuronal excitability.  抑制性神经递质GABA降低神经元的兴奋性。


近义词：restrictive, suppressive, repressive, deterrent | 反义词：stimulatory, excitatory, promoting


词源：  The word "rehibitory" is derived from the verb "inhibit," which comes from the Latin word "inhibere," meaning "to hold back" or "to restrain."  The prefix "re-" is often used for intensification or repetition, though its use in "rehibitory" is less common and arguably redundant given the existence of "inhibitory."  The "-ory" suffix indicates that something has the quality or function of something else.  Therefore, "rehibitory" literally means having the quality of holding back or restraining repeatedly or intensely.
