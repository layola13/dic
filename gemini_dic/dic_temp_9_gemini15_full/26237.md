词源：The word "buttermilk" is a compound word.  "Butter" derives from Old English *butere,  ultimately from Proto-Germanic *buterō, meaning "butter".  "Milk" comes from Old English *milc, from Proto-Germanic *melkō.  The term "buttermilk" refers to the liquid left over after churning butter from cream.  The churning process separates the butterfat from the remaining liquid, which is then called buttermilk.
