词源:
The word "miniate" comes from the Medieval Latin word *miniāre*, meaning "to use red lead," referring to the use of red lead in the illumination of manuscripts.  Over time, the meaning shifted to encompass the creation of small, detailed paintings, particularly those found in illuminated manuscripts.  The connection to red lead is due to its prominent use as a pigment in early miniature paintings.
