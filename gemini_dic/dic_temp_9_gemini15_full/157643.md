词源:  The word "pittance" originates from the Old French word "pitance," meaning "alms" or "a charitable donation."  This ultimately derives from the Late Latin word "pietas," meaning "piety" or "religious devotion."  The connection lies in the idea that charitable giving was often a small portion of one's resources, given out of religious duty. Over time, the word's meaning shifted to refer to any small or meager amount of money, often implying inadequacy or insufficient payment for work done.
