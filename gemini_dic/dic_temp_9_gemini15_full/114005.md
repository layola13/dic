Etymology:  The word derives from "magistrate," which comes from the Latin *magister* meaning "master" or "teacher."  The suffix "-ical" transforms the noun into an adjective, signifying "pertaining to" or "characteristic of."  Therefore, "magistratical" literally means "pertaining to a magistrate" or "having the qualities of a magistrate."
