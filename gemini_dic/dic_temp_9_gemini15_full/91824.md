hypergenesis:/ˌhaɪpərˈdʒɛnɪsɪs/| n. |过度生成；异常发育|The excessive or abnormal development of an organ or tissue.  It often implies an overproduction beyond what is normally needed or expected. For example, in geology, it can refer to an excessive formation of a particular rock type. In biology, it might describe the overgrowth of cells or tissues.|Example: The excessive bone growth observed in the patient was a clear case of hypergenesis.  患者身上观察到的过度骨骼生长是明显的过度生成的案例。|近义词：overgrowth, hypertrophy, hyperplasia|反义词：hypoplasia, underdevelopment
