WORD ORIGIN->

The word "naysayer" is a relatively modern word, originating in the late 20th century.  It's a compound word combining "nay" (meaning "no") and "sayer" (someone who says).  The "nay" part comes from Old English  "nā,"  while "sayer" derives from Old English "secgan" (to say).  Therefore, a naysayer is literally someone who says "no."
