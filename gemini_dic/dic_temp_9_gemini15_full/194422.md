self-reductions:/ˌsɛlf rɪˈdʌkʃənz/| n. | 自归约 | In computational complexity theory, a self-reduction is a type of reduction where an algorithm for solving a problem can be used to solve instances of the same problem, but of smaller size. This allows for recursive or iterative solutions.  It's a crucial concept in understanding the complexity of problems. | Example:  Finding the maximum element in an unsorted array can be considered a self-reduction because you can recursively solve the problem by comparing elements and discarding the smaller ones until only the maximum remains. | 近义词: recursive reduction | 反义词:  N/A (no direct antonym)
