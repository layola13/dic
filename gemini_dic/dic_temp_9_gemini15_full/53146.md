词源:  From "diplomat" + "-ism".  "Diplomat" ultimately derives from the Greek word "diplōma" (δίπλωμα), meaning "a folded document," often referring to official documents or certificates.  The sense of "diplomat" evolved from this because diplomats often carried and presented such credentials.  The "-ism" suffix indicates a system, practice, or characteristic.
