hydropath:/ˈhaɪdrəˌpæθ/| n. |疏水性物质；憎水性物质 |A hydropath is a substance that repels water.  It is characterized by its inability to dissolve in water or interact with water molecules. This property is often due to the presence of nonpolar molecules or groups within the substance. Hydrophobic interactions play a significant role in various biological processes, such as protein folding and the formation of cell membranes. |Example:  Many oils are hydropaths and do not mix with water. 许多油是疏水性物质，不会与水混合。|近义词:hydrophobe|反义词:hydrophile

USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "hello".  Therefore, tense-related examples are not applicable.  Instead, here are examples demonstrating its use in different sentence structures:


Simple Sentence:
The protein's hydrophobic regions clustered together. 蛋白的疏水区域聚集在一起。


Complex Sentence:
Because the surface is hydropathic, the water beads up and rolls off. 因为表面是疏水性的，水会凝结成珠并滚落。


Compound Sentence:
The material is a hydropath; therefore, it's unsuitable for this application.  该材料是疏水性物质；因此，它不适合此应用。


PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases directly using "hydropath" as it's a scientific term.  However, related phrases involving hydrophobicity or hydrophobic interactions are common in scientific contexts.  Examples include:

hydrophobic interaction: 疏水相互作用
hydrophobic effect: 疏水效应
hydrophobic collapse: 疏水坍塌
hydrophobic core: 疏水核心
amphipathic molecule: 两亲分子 (containing both hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts)
