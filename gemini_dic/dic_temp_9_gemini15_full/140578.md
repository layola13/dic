oligomerous:/ɒlɪˈɡɒmərəs/ | adj. |低聚体的；寡聚的 | Consisting of or relating to an oligomer;  characterized by the presence of a relatively small number of monomer units.  An oligomer is a molecule that consists of a few repeating structural units (monomers).  The term often implies that the number of units is relatively small and not precisely defined, in contrast to a polymer which has many units. |

例句：

The oligomerous proteins formed stable complexes. =  形成稳定的低聚体蛋白复合物。

The reaction yielded a mixture of oligomerous and monomeric species. = 该反应产生了低聚体和单体物质的混合物。
