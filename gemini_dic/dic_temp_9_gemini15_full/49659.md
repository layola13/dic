The word "demisabilities" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  To help you, we need to understand what the intended meaning was.  Was it perhaps meant to be a combination of words related to disability?  If you can provide more context or the intended meaning, I can help construct a possible analysis based on that.
