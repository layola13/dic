nonterminal:/ˌnɑːnˈtɜːrmɪnəl/| adj. n.|非终结符，非终端节点|In formal language theory, a nonterminal is a symbol that can be further rewritten using production rules.  It represents a syntactic category or a phrase structure in a grammar.  Unlike terminal symbols (which represent the actual words or characters of the language), nonterminals are placeholders that are replaced during the process of deriving a sentence.|例句：In the grammar for arithmetic expressions, '+' is a terminal symbol, while 'expression' is a nonterminal.|近义词：syntactic category, phrase structure|反义词：terminal symbol
