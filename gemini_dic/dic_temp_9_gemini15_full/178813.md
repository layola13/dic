recursive:/rɪˈkɜːrsɪv/ | adj. | 递归的，循环的 | Relating to or involving the repeated application of a rule, procedure, operation, etc., to its own output.  A recursive function, for example, calls itself within its own definition. | Example:  The program uses a recursive algorithm to sort the data.  这个程序使用递归算法来排序数据。 |近义词：iterative, self-referential | 反义词：iterative (in some contexts, as iterative methods can be contrasted with recursive ones)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The function recursively calls itself. = 这个函数递归地调用自身。
This process is recursively defined. = 这个过程是递归定义的。


一般过去时:
The program recursively processed the list. = 程序递归地处理了列表。
The algorithm recursively searched the tree. = 算法递归地搜索了树。


现在完成时:
The system has recursively calculated the result. = 系统已经递归地计算出了结果。
The function has recursively traversed the directory. = 函数已经递归地遍历了目录。


过去完成时:
The program had recursively analyzed the data before outputting the results. = 程序在输出结果之前已经递归地分析了数据。
The function had recursively called itself multiple times. = 该函数已经递归地调用自身多次。


将来时:
The function will recursively handle the incoming data. = 该函数将递归地处理传入的数据。
The algorithm will recursively solve the problem. = 该算法将递归地解决问题。


虚拟语气:
If the function were recursive, it would be more concise. = 如果该函数是递归的，它将更简洁。
It would be easier if the solution were recursive. = 如果解决方案是递归的，将会更容易。


被动语态:
The problem is recursively solved by the algorithm. = 这个问题由算法递归地解决。
The data is recursively processed by the system. = 数据由系统递归地处理。


疑问句:
Is this function recursive? = 这个函数是递归的吗？
Is the solution a recursive one? = 解决方案是递归的吗？


否定句:
The function is not recursive. = 这个函数不是递归的。
The algorithm does not use a recursive approach. = 该算法不使用递归方法。



PHRASE->
recursive function = 递归函数
recursive algorithm = 递归算法
recursive definition = 递归定义
recursive call = 递归调用
recursive structure = 递归结构
