/ˈmɔːrnɪsɪz/ | n. |更多性；过多；过量 |  The word "moreness's" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be an attempt to create a possessive form of "moreness," which itself is a relatively uncommon word. "Moreness" refers to the quality or state of being more; an excess or abundance.  The possessive form, "moreness's," would be used to show ownership or possession relating to this quality or state. However,  it's grammatically awkward and should be avoided in formal writing.  A better phrasing would usually involve rewording the sentence. | Example: (Awkward and incorrect) The painting's moreness's were striking. (Correct and improved) The painting's striking abundance of detail was remarkable. |  近义词:  excess, abundance, superfluity | 反义词: deficiency, lack, scarcity |  n.
