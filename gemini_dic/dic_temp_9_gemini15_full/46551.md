词源:
The word "dalliance" comes from the Middle English word "dalyaunce," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "dalier," meaning "to dally" or "to trifle."  This in turn likely has roots in a Germanic word meaning "to delay" or "to linger."  The evolution reflects a shift from the original sense of delaying or lingering to the current connotation of playful or frivolous activity or relationship.
