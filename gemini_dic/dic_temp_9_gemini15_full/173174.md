词源：

The word is a combination of "quasi," meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent," and "awful," meaning "extremely bad or unpleasant."  "Quasi" originates from Latin, while "awful" has a more complex etymology, ultimately deriving from "awe," meaning "fear or reverence," which over time shifted to mean "extremely bad."  The combination creates a word describing something that is somewhat bad but not completely so.
