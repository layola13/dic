词源:
From Middle English skeptik, from Late Latin scepticus, from Greek skeptikos, from skeptikos ‘inquirer’, from skeptesthai ‘to look, consider, inquire’.  The Greek word ultimately relates to the verb *sképtesthai*, meaning "to look" or "to examine."  The original sense was of someone who inquired critically, not necessarily someone who doubted everything. The modern meaning evolved over time.
