词源:
The word "pasting" comes from the verb "paste," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "paster," meaning "to stick," or "to glue."  This in turn connects to the Latin word "pastare," which meant "to knead dough," implying a process of pressing and adhering materials.  The evolution reflects the historical use of pastes (thick mixtures) as adhesives.
