/ˌoʊvərˈnoʊblənəsɪz/ | n. | 过分高贵；矫揉造作的贵族气派 |  The word "overnoblenesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a newly coined word, formed by combining "over-" (meaning excessive or too much) with "nobleness" (meaning the quality of being noble) and adding a plural "-es".  It suggests an excessive or affected display of nobility, possibly implying arrogance or pretentiousness.  There are no standard dictionaries that list this word, and it lacks established usage or meaning.  Therefore, it cannot be analyzed in terms of traditional grammatical tenses, voice, or common phrases.
