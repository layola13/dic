词源:
The word "ingesting" comes from the Latin word "ingestus," the past participle of "ingerere," meaning "to carry in," "to put in," or "to introduce."  The prefix "in-" means "in" or "into," and the root "-gerere" is related to the verb "to carry" or "to bear."  Thus, "ingesting" literally means "carrying in" or "introducing into" the body.
