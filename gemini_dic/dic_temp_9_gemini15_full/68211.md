词源:
The verb "fair" in this sense ultimately derives from the Old English word "faræn," meaning "to go, journey, travel."  Over time, its meaning shifted to encompass the idea of progressing or succeeding in a journey or undertaking.  The sense of "performing" or "succeeding" in a contest or situation evolved from this earlier meaning.
