词源:
The word "shock absorber" is a compound word.  "Shock" comes from the Middle English word "shok," meaning a sudden impact or collision. "Absorber" derives from the verb "absorb," ultimately from the Latin word "absorbēre," meaning "to swallow up."  Therefore, "shock absorber" literally means a device that swallows up or takes in the impact of a shock.
