The word "gyse" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a very rare word, a word from a dialect, or a neologism (newly coined word).  To provide the requested information, I would need clarification or a corrected spelling.
