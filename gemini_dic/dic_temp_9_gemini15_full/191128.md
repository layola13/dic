scapolite:/ˈskæpəlaɪt/| n. |方柱石|A group of minerals that are tectosilicates of sodium, calcium, and aluminum, with chloride, sulfate, or carbonate often present.  They typically form prismatic crystals and are found in metamorphic rocks.  The color varies widely, depending on impurities. |Example: The geologist identified the sample as a variety of scapolite, based on its optical properties and chemical composition. 地质学家根据其光学特性和化学成分，将样品鉴定为一种方柱石。|近义词：wernerite (a specific type of scapolite)|反义词：无
