The word "inter-choking" is not a standard English word found in dictionaries or common usage.  It appears to be a newly coined or very rarely used term, possibly a blend or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are not possible.  To provide a response in the requested format would be misleading.

If you intended a different word, or if "inter-choking" is from a specific context (e.g., a technical manual, a novel), providing that context would allow for a more accurate analysis.  The "inter-" prefix generally suggests something between or among, and "choking" refers to the act of having one's breath restricted.  Therefore, a possible interpretation (though highly speculative without context) could be something like "mutual choking" or "choking each other," but this is purely conjecture.
