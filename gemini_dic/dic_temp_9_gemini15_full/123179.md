词源:

* **mono-**:  From Greek *monos* meaning "single," "alone," or "only."  This prefix is widely used in English to indicate "one" or "single."

* **-coloured**:  From "color," ultimately from Old French *color* and Latin *color* meaning "color," "appearance," or "hue."  The suffix "-ed" here functions as a past participle, creating an adjectival form.
