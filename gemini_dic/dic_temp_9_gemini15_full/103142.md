The word "jerriest" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a regionalism, a neologism (newly coined word), or a proper noun (a name).  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (A book, a conversation, online?)
* **What was the sentence or context in which it was used?** This will help determine the intended meaning and possible origins.

If you can provide this additional information, I can attempt to offer a possible interpretation and analysis.
