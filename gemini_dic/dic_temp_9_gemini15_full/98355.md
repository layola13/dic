词源:
The word "insisted" comes from the verb "insist," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "insistere," meaning "to stand upon, persist."  The prefix "in-" means "on" or "upon," and the root "-sistere" comes from the verb "sistere," meaning "to stand" or "to cause to stand still."  Therefore, the original meaning is closely tied to the idea of standing firm or steadfast in one's position.
