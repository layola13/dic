词源：

The word "ramification" comes from the French word "ramification," which itself comes from the Latin word "ramificatio," a combination of "ramus" (branch) and "-ficatio" (the act of making).  The original meaning was related to the branching of something, such as a tree or a river.  Over time, the meaning extended to the branching out of consequences or implications.
