The word "isayas" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please double-check the spelling.

2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name (personal or place) or a brand name.  If so, providing more context would be helpful.

3. **It's from another language:**  It may be a word borrowed from another language.  If you can provide the language of origin, I might be able to help.

4. **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context. Again, more information is needed.


Without more context, I cannot provide the requested information (phonetics, word class, meaning, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc.). Please provide additional details so I can assist you accurately.
