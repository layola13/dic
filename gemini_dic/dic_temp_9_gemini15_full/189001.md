The word "saams" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (like a name or acronym), or a word from a specific dialect or jargon.  To provide the requested information, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about its usage.
