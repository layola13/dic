词源:

The word "nonyielding" is a compound word.  It combines the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the present participle "yielding" (from the verb "to yield," meaning "to give way," "to surrender," or "to produce").  Therefore, "nonyielding" literally means "not yielding."  The roots trace back to Old English "gieldan" (to pay, recompense) and the negative prefix "non" having Latin origins.
