pseudo-operation:/ˈsuːdoʊˌɒpəˈreɪʃən/|/ˈsjuːdəʊˌɒpəˈreɪʃən/| n. |伪操作，虚拟操作 |A pseudo-operation is an instruction in assembly language that is not directly executed by the processor but is instead processed by the assembler to generate one or more actual machine instructions.  It is used to provide higher-level abstractions or perform tasks that are not directly supported by the processor's instruction set. For example, a pseudo-operation might be used to allocate memory, define constants, or include external files. | Example:  The `EQU` pseudo-operation in some assemblers assigns a symbolic name to a constant value.  `COUNT EQU 10`  This doesn't directly translate to a machine instruction but tells the assembler to substitute '10' wherever 'COUNT' appears.|近义词:directive, macro, assembler directive |反义词:machine instruction
