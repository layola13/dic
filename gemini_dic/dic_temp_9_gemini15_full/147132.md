/ˌoʊvərˌlɒdʒɪˈkælɪtiz/ | n. | 过度逻辑性；逻辑上的过度推演 | Overlogicalities refer to instances where logic is excessively or inappropriately applied, leading to unreasonable or absurd conclusions.  It suggests a rigid adherence to logic that ignores context, nuance, or common sense.  This term is not commonly used and is likely a neologism (newly coined word).  There is no established usage in dictionaries or corpora.  Because of its rarity, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usages is difficult and speculative.


例句：

His argument, while logically sound in its individual steps, devolved into overlogicalities that rendered its overall conclusion nonsensical.  他的论证虽然在各个步骤上在逻辑上是合理的，但却演变成了过度逻辑的推演，使得其整体结论毫无意义。
