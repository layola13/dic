proteolysis:/ˌproʊtiˈɒlɪsɪs/ | /ˌproʊtiˈɑːlɪsɪs/ | n. | 蛋白质水解 | The enzymatic breakdown of proteins into smaller polypeptides or amino acids.  This process is essential for various biological functions, including digestion, protein turnover, and regulation of cellular processes. | Example:  Proteolysis plays a crucial role in the digestive system. = 蛋白质水解在消化系统中起着至关重要的作用。

The study of proteolysis revealed a novel mechanism of cellular regulation. = 蛋白质水解的研究揭示了一种新的细胞调控机制。


近义词：protein degradation, proteolytic degradation | 反义词：protein synthesis
