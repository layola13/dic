The word "kung" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a word from another language.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested isn't possible.  To provide the requested information, I need a valid English word.

If "kung" is a misspelling or a word from another language (like Cantonese Kung Fu), please provide the correct spelling or context so I can assist you properly.
