The word "nisam" is not a word found in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a word from another language, possibly a misspelling, or a proper noun.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical examples as requested in the format.  To provide this information, I need a valid English word or a clarification on the language of origin and intended meaning of "nisam."
