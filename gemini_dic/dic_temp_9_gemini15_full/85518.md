词源:
The word "hasty" comes from the Middle English word "hasty," which in turn comes from the Old French word "hastif," meaning "quick," "swift," or "speedy."  Ultimately, its roots trace back to the Latin word "haestus," meaning "heat," implying the quickness associated with something fervent or passionate.
