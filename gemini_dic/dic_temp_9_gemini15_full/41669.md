correlator: /ˈkɔːrəleɪtər/ | n. | 相关器；关联器；相关计算器 | A correlator is a device or algorithm that calculates the correlation between two signals or data sets.  It measures the degree to which two signals are similar or related. This is often used in signal processing, statistics, and other fields to identify patterns, detect signals in noise, and analyze relationships between variables. | Example:  The satellite uses a correlator to determine the precise location of the signal source.  卫星使用相关器来确定信号源的精确位置。 | 近义词:  comparator, comparer | 反义词:  (没有直接的反义词，其功能的反面是“不计算相关性”)
