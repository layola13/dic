The word "noses" is not a valid English word.  It's a pluralization of "nose," which is the correct word to use.  Therefore, I will provide the analysis for "nose" instead.


nose: /noʊz/ | n. | 鼻子 | The organ of smell and the prominent feature of the face.  It is also used figuratively to refer to someone's sense of smell, intuition or to interfere in other people's affairs. | 例句：The dog sniffed the ground with its nose. = 狗用鼻子嗅着地面。  He has a good nose for business. = 他有敏锐的商业嗅觉。 | 近义词：snout, proboscis | 反义词： (No direct antonym, but contextually opposites might include "blindness" regarding intuition) | 名词
