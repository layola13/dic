词源:
The word "maunder" ultimately derives from the Old French word "maundier," meaning "to beg" or "to wander."  This likely evolved from the Latin "mandūcāre," meaning "to chew" or "to eat," which suggests an association with aimless, perhaps hungry, wandering.  The shift in meaning from begging/wandering to rambling speech likely occurred over time through metaphorical association.
