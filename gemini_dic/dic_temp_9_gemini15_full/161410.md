postulatum: /pɒsˈtʃuːlətəm/ | n. | 假定；公设；前提 | A postulate is a statement that is accepted as true without proof, often serving as a basis for further reasoning or argumentation. It's a fundamental assumption upon which a theory or system is built.  | Example:  Euclid's postulates formed the foundation of his geometry.  欧几里得的公设构成了他几何学的基石。


The fifth postulate, also known as the parallel postulate, was particularly controversial. 第五公设，也称为平行公设，尤其具有争议性。|近义词：axiom, assumption, premise |反义词：proof, theorem, demonstration
