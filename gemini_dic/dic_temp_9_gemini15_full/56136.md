词源:
The word "documental" is derived from the noun "document," ultimately from the Latin word "documentum," meaning "something that provides evidence." The suffix "-al" is used to form adjectives.  Therefore, "documental" originally described something that served as a document or provided evidence, and it later came to specifically refer to films that document reality.
