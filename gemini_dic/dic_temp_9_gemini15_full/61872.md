词源:

The word "empowerment" originates from the verb "empower," which itself is a combination of the prefix "em-" (meaning "in" or "into") and the noun "power."  The prefix "em-" is of Old English Germanic origin, while "power" comes from Old French "pouer" and ultimately from Latin "potēre" (to be able). Thus, "empowerment" signifies the act of putting power into someone or something.
