词源:  Derived from "knave," meaning a dishonest or unscrupulous man.  The suffix "-ishly" adds an adverbial quality, transforming the noun into an adverb describing manner.  The word's origins trace back to Old English "cnāfa," meaning "boy,"  but its meaning shifted over time to denote a dishonest or deceitful person.
