词源:

The word "democratic" derives from the Greek word "dēmokratia," which is a combination of "dēmos" (δήμος), meaning "people," and "kratos" (κράτος), meaning "power" or "rule."  Therefore, "dēmokratia" literally translates to "rule by the people."  The word entered English through French and other Romance languages.
