词源:

re- (prefix indicating repetition or reversal) + connection (noun derived from the verb "connect") + 's (possessive suffix)

The word is formed by adding a possessive suffix ('s) to the noun "reconnection," which itself is formed from the prefix "re-" meaning again or anew, and the noun "connection," indicating a link or joining.  Therefore, "reconnection's" signifies the belonging to or characteristic of a reconnection.
