The word "refinger" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  To provide a helpful response, I need clarification on what word you intended.  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word, or you could provide context where you encountered this word.
