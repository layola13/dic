The word "misprovoking" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It seems to be a neologism or a misspelling.  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need to consider what the intended word might be.  It likely combines "mis-" (wrongly, badly) with a word related to "provoke".
