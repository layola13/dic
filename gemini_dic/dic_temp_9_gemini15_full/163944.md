词源:
The word "predicament" ultimately derives from the Old French word "predicament," which itself comes from the Medieval Latin word "praedicamentum."  This Latin word is related to "praedicare," meaning "to proclaim, preach, assert," and is connected to the philosophical notion of "categories" or "types" of being.  The original sense referred to a classification or category, but the meaning evolved to its current sense of a difficult or troublesome situation over time.
