ctenophora:/tɛˈnɒfərə/| n. |栉水母; 栉水母纲动物|Ctenophora is a phylum of invertebrate animals that are exclusively marine.  They are gelatinous, transparent, and often bioluminescent creatures, characterized by their comb-like plates of cilia (ctenes) that they use for locomotion.  They are sometimes mistaken for jellyfish, but they are distinct in their anatomy and genetic makeup.| Example:  The deep-sea ctenophore displayed a mesmerizing bioluminescent display.|近义词:comb jelly|反义词:None
