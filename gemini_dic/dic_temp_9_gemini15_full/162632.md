词源:
The word "preapprehensions" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in anticipation of") and the noun "apprehensions" (meaning "anxiety" or "fear").  The root of "apprehension" is the Latin word "apprehendere," meaning "to seize" or "to grasp," which later evolved to encompass the sense of mental grasping or understanding, and ultimately, anxiety or fear about something.
