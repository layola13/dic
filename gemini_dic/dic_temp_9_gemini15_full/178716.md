recrystallize:/ˌriːˈkrɪstəlaɪz/| vt.|再结晶；重结晶|To form new crystals from a substance that has already been crystallized.  This process often results in larger, more perfect crystals.  It's commonly used in metallurgy and chemistry to improve the properties of materials.|例句：The metal was recrystallized to increase its ductility. 金属经过再结晶以提高其延展性。|例句：The chemist recrystallized the compound to purify it. 化学家重结晶化合物以使其纯化。|近义词：re-form, refine|反义词：melt, fuse|动词
