semireflexiveness:/ˌsɛmiˌriˈflɛksɪvnəs/| n. |半自反性，部分自反性 |The property of a relation being partially reflexive.  A relation R on a set A is semireflexive if for all x in A, if (x,x) ∈ R, then for all y in A such that (x,y) ∈ R and (y,x) ∈ R, we have (y,y) ∈ R.  This means that if a element is related to itself, and to another element which is also related to it, then that other element must also be related to itself. |  The concept of semireflexiveness is important in certain branches of mathematics, particularly in the study of relations and orderings.  | 近义词：partial reflexivity | 反义词：irreflexivity
