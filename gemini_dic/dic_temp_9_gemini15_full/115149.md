词源:
The word "manhandle" combines "man" (referring to human strength) and "handle" (to manage or control).  It developed in the early 20th century, reflecting a sense of forceful, often rough, handling.  The 'man' part emphasizes the physical strength involved, often exceeding what is necessary or appropriate.
