词源:

The word "exultant" comes from the Latin word "exultare," which means "to leap for joy" or "to rejoice greatly."  It's a combination of the prefix "ex-" (out, from) and "saltare" (to leap, dance).  Therefore, the root meaning involves an outward expression of great joy, often manifested physically.
