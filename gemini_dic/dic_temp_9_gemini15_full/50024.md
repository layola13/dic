词源：

From "denomination" + "-ally".  "Denomination" originates from the Latin word "denominatio," meaning "naming" or "giving a name."  The religious sense developed over time, referring to distinct religious groups identified by their particular beliefs and practices.  The suffix "-ally" forms adverbs, indicating "in a manner of" or "in relation to."
