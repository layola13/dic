词源:

The word "disadvantaging" is derived from the noun "disadvantage," which is formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") to the noun "advantage."  The "-ing" suffix transforms it into a present participle, functioning as a verb.  The root "advantage" itself has complex origins, ultimately stemming from Old French *avant, meaning "before," and Old French *tage, a form of Old Norse *tak, meaning "taking."  The original meaning suggests a prior "taking" or position of benefit. Therefore, "disadvantage" means "lack of a prior beneficial position."
