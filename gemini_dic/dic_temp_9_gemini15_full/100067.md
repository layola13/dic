/ɪnˈtɜːrpəleɪtərz/ | n. | 插值器；内插器 | A device or program that calculates intermediate values between known data points.  It's used in various fields, such as computer graphics, signal processing, and numerical analysis to estimate values within a range of known data. | Example:  The software uses a sophisticated interpolater to create smooth curves from a set of scattered points.  插值软件使用复杂的插值器从一组离散点创建平滑曲线。|近义词:interpolator, estimator|反义词:extrapolator


USAGE->
This word is a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "What" in the example.  Therefore, standard verb tense examples are not applicable.  Instead, usage examples will focus on how "interpolators" are used in different contexts.

Example 1 (Computer Graphics):
The image processing software uses linear interpolators to smoothly transition between different colors. 图像处理软件使用线性插值器在不同的颜色之间平滑过渡。


Example 2 (Signal Processing):
High-quality audio players often employ sophisticated interpolators to improve the sound quality of upsampled audio. 高品质音频播放器通常采用复杂的插值器来提高上采样音频的音质。


Example 3 (Scientific Computing):
Scientists used cubic spline interpolators to model the complex relationship between temperature and pressure. 科学家使用三次样条插值器来模拟温度和压力之间的复杂关系。


Example 4 (Data Analysis):
The statistical analysis relied on a nearest-neighbor interpolater to estimate missing data points. 统计分析依赖于最近邻插值器来估计缺失的数据点。


Example 5 (Financial Modeling):
Financial models frequently use interpolators to predict future values based on historical data. 金融模型经常使用插值器来根据历史数据预测未来值。
