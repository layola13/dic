recessivity:/ˌrɪsɛˈsɪvɪti/ | n. |隐性性状，隐性，隐性遗传|The state or quality of being recessive; the phenomenon where one allele masks the expression of another allele.  Recessiveness refers to the relationship between two versions of a gene. Individuals receive two versions of each gene, known as alleles, one from each parent. If the alleles are different, the dominant allele will be expressed, while the recessive allele will be masked.  A recessive trait will only be expressed if an individual inherits two copies of the recessive allele. | Example: Blue eyes are a recessive trait; a person must inherit two copies of the blue-eye allele to have blue eyes.  |近义词：passivity, latency |反义词：dominance
