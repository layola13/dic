词源:  The word "delicious" comes from the Old French word *delicius*, which itself is derived from the Latin word *deliciosus*.  *Deliciosus* is formed from *delicates*, meaning "delightful," "charming," or "pleasing," related to the noun *deliciæ*, meaning "delights" or "dainties."  The suffix *-osus* in Latin indicates "full of" or "characterized by," thus, *deliciosus* literally means "full of delights."
