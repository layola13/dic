factorability: /ˌfæktərəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可因式分解性，可分解性 | The property of being able to be factored.  It often refers to the ability of a number or a polynomial to be expressed as a product of simpler factors.  | Example: The factorability of the polynomial x² - 4 is high because it can be easily factored into (x-2)(x+2).  The factorability of a large number is often a complex problem in number theory. | 近义词: decomposability, divisibility | 反义词:  primality (for numbers), irreducibility (for polynomials)

词源:
The word "factorability" is derived from the noun "factor" and the suffix "-ability," which indicates the capacity or potential for something.  "Factor" itself has roots in Latin ("facere," meaning "to do" or "to make").  The meaning evolved through the mathematical concept of expressing a number or polynomial as a product of its factors.
