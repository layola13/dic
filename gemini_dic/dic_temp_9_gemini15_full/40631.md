PHRASE->
There is no common phrase directly using "conventicling."  The word itself is relatively rare.  However, we can create phrases illustrating its usage:

illegal conventicling = 非法集会

词源:  The word "conventicling" derives from the word "conventicle," which comes from the Late Latin word *conventiculum*, a diminutive of *convenire* ("to come together").  The suffix "-ing" adds a gerund or present participle sense, indicating the action of holding such a meeting.  The word's history reflects its association with small, often clandestine, religious gatherings, especially those dissenting from the established church.
