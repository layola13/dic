WORD ORIGIN->
The word "pseudomythically" is formed from the following components:

* **pseudo-:**  A prefix of Greek origin meaning "false," "sham," or "pretended."

Therefore, "pseudomythically" describes something that resembles a myth or legend but is not genuinely one; it's a fabricated or embellished version of a myth.
