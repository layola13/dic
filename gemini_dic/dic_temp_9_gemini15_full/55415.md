词源:  The word "distillable" is derived from the verb "distil" (or "distill"), which itself comes from the Medieval Latin word "distillare," a compound of "de-" (down) and "stillare" (to drip, fall drop by drop).  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or possibility.  Thus, "distillable" means capable of being distilled.
