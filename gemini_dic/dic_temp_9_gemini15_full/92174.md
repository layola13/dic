PHRASE->
Because "hyperspatiality" is a relatively new and specialized term, common phrases directly incorporating it are limited.  Instead, we can show how it might be used within phrases:

a sense of hyperspatiality: 一种超空间感
experience of hyperspatiality: 超空间体验
the effects of hyperspatiality: 超空间的影响
degree of hyperspatiality: 超空间程度
manifestation of hyperspatiality: 超空间的表现


词源:

The word "hyperspatiality" is a modern coinage, formed by combining:

* **hyper-**:  A prefix meaning "above," "beyond," "excessive," or "over."  It indicates a degree or intensity exceeding the norm.
* **spatial**: Relating to space.  Derived from the Latin "spatium" (space).
* **-ity**: A suffix forming nouns of state, condition, or quality.


Therefore, "hyperspatiality" literally describes a condition or state that is "beyond" or "exceeding" normal spatial perception or experience.
