词源:
The word "decanter" comes from the French word "décanter," which means "to pour off gently."  It ultimately derives from the Latin word "decantare," meaning "to pour off" or "to decant."  The process of decanting involves carefully pouring a liquid, often wine, from one container to another, usually to separate sediment or allow the liquid to aerate.
