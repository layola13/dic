词源:
The word "reintrench" comes from the French word "retrancher," which means "to cut off," "to cut back," or "to withdraw."  The prefix "re-" indicates a repetition or renewal of the action.  The original meaning referred to the digging of trenches for defensive purposes, and the modern usage has extended to the broader sense of reducing or restricting something.
