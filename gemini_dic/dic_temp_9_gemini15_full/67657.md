词源:
The word "extrovertively" is derived from the adjective "extroverted," which itself comes from the noun "extrovert."  "Extrovert" is a relatively modern word coined in the early 20th century by Carl Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist.  It's formed from the prefix "extra-" (meaning "outside" or "beyond") and "vert" (related to "vertere," Latin for "to turn").  Thus, an extrovert is someone whose attention is turned outwards, towards the external world. Adding "-ly" creates the adverbial form.
