词源:
The word "drudger" comes from the Middle English word "drugger," meaning "a person who works hard and diligently."  This, in turn, is derived from the Old English word "drugan," meaning "to work hard."  The modern spelling and meaning evolved over time, solidifying the current connotation of repetitive and often unrewarding labor.
