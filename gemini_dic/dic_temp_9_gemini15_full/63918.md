epiphysis:/ɪˈpɪfɪsɪs/| n. |骨骺；松果体|The end part of a long bone, initially separated from the shaft by cartilage, but later becoming united with it by ossification.  The pineal gland in the brain.|例句：The epiphysis of the femur is crucial for bone growth.股骨的骨骺对骨骼生长至关重要。

The epiphysis secretes melatonin, which regulates sleep cycles. 松果体分泌褪黑素，调节睡眠周期。|近义词：bone end,  pineal gland|反义词：diaphysis (bone shaft)


USAGE->

一般现在时:
