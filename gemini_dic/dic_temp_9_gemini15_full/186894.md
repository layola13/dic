词源:
The word "riot" comes from the Old French word "riot," meaning "tumult, disorder."  This in turn derives from the Old North French word "riote," meaning "quarrel, dispute".  The ultimate origin is uncertain, but possible links exist to words meaning “noisy” or “tumultuous.”  The verb form "rioted" follows standard English verb conjugation patterns.
