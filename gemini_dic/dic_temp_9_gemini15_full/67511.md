extractibility: /ˌɛkstræktəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可提取性，萃取率 | The ability of a substance to be extracted from a mixture or solution.  This refers to the ease and efficiency with which a component can be separated from a complex matrix.  It is often expressed as a percentage or a yield.  Factors influencing extractibility include the chemical properties of the substance, the solvent used, and the extraction method employed. |

例句：

The extractibility of the active compound from the plant material was found to be quite high. = 从植物材料中提取活性化合物的可提取性很高。

Researchers investigated the extractibility of uranium from the ore using different leaching agents. = 研究人员使用不同的浸出剂研究了从矿石中提取铀的可提取性。


近义词：recoverability, extractability

反义词：inextractability

This method does not offer high extractibility. = 此方法的可提取性不高。

PHRASE->
high extractibility = 高可提取性
low extractibility = 低可提取性
improved extractibility = 提高的可提取性
optimal extractibility = 最佳可提取性
determining extractibility = 测定可提取性

词源:

The word "extractibility" is derived from the verb "extract" and the suffix "-ability".  "Extract" comes from the Latin word "extrahere," meaning "to draw out" or "to pull out." The suffix "-ability" indicates the capacity or potential for something. Therefore, "extractibility" signifies the capacity or potential for being extracted.
