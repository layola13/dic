词源:The word "republican" derives from the Latin word "res publica," meaning "public thing" or "commonwealth." This term was used to describe the Roman Republic, a system of government where power is held by the people and their elected representatives.  The modern usage of "republican" evolved from this historical context, referring to both a system of government and the political party associated with it.
