词源：

The word "quasi" is derived from the Latin word "quasi," meaning "as if," "almost," or "like."  "Athletic" comes from the Greek word "athlos," meaning "contest" or "struggle," and "-ic" is a suffix forming adjectives.  Therefore, "quasi-athletic" literally means "almost like an athlete" or "having some of the qualities of an athlete."
