The word "feel-to" does not exist as a single, standard English word.  It's likely a typo or a non-standard phrase.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis following your requested format.  To help you, I need clarification:

* **Is this a typo?**  Could you have meant a different word or phrase? Please double-check your spelling.
* **Is it a specific term within a particular field?** (e.g., technical jargon, slang)  If so, please specify the context.
* **Is it a combination of words intended to convey a specific meaning?**  If so, please explain the intended meaning.


Once you provide more information, I can offer a more accurate and helpful response.
