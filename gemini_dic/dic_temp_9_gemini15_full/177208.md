词源:
The word "rearticulate" is formed from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the verb "articulate," which comes from the Latin word "articulatus," meaning "jointed."  The original meaning referred to the physical act of joining bones or limbs.  The modern usage extends the meaning to the expression and clarification of ideas, treating them as if they were being re-jointed or re-formed into a clearer structure.
