词源:
The word "pelting" comes from the Middle English word "pelten," meaning "to throw." This, in turn, has roots in the Old English word "peltan," of uncertain origin but possibly related to words meaning "to strike" or "to beat." The noun form, referring to the action of throwing, developed later.  The application to heavy rain likely arose from the image of raindrops "striking" a surface repeatedly.
