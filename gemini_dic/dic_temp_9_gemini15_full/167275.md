prethrusting: /ˌpriːˈθrʌstɪŋ/ | adj. | 前冲的；前缘推进的 | Relating to or characterized by the movement of a tectonic plate or rock mass before the main thrust faulting event.  It describes the processes and structures that develop before the major thrust fault is formed.  This often involves deformation and uplift in the region that will eventually become the hanging wall of the thrust fault. | 例句：The prethrusting deformation resulted in significant folding and fracturing of the sedimentary layers.  前冲变形导致沉积层发生明显的褶皱和破裂。


The prethrusting phase was characterized by subtle uplift and tilting of the strata. 前冲阶段的特点是地层的轻微抬升和倾斜。 | 近义词：antecedent, pre-faulting | 反义词：postthrusting
