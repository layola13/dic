词源:
The word "lackadaisy" likely originated as a playful alteration or perhaps a mishearing of the phrase "lack-a-day," an exclamation expressing weariness or sadness.  "Lack-a-day" itself is an archaic expression, and the addition of "-isy" creates an adjectival form suggesting a continuous state of that weariness or listlessness.  The precise etymology is unclear, but its origins clearly lie in expressions of fatigue and disinterest.
