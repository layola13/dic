cystidea:/sɪsˈtɪdiə/| n.|海胆幼体；拟海胆；海胆类幼虫|A cystidea is the larval stage of a sea urchin, characterized by its spherical or ovoid shape and ciliated bands used for locomotion.  It is a free-swimming, planktonic organism that undergoes metamorphosis to become a juvenile sea urchin.|The cystidea stage is crucial for the dispersal and survival of sea urchins.|近义词：echinoderm larva (广义)|反义词：无
