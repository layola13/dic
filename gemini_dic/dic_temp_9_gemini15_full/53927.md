词源:
The word "discoursing" comes from the Old French word "discours," meaning "speech, conversation, discourse," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "discursus," meaning "running to and fro, a running about,"  and "discurrere," meaning "to run about, to ramble."  The sense of a formal and extended discussion developed over time.
