词源：The word "full-blooded" is a compound word. "Full" means complete or entire, and "blooded" refers to the bloodline or lineage, especially in the context of animals and their breeds.  The term originated in the context of animal breeding, specifically referring to animals of pure lineage without any crossbreeding. Over time, its usage expanded to describe people of pure racial descent and later to denote something done with complete energy and enthusiasm.


用法说明：

The adjective "full-blooded" can be used to describe:

1. **Animals:**  Referring to animals of a particular breed without any mixture of other breeds.  For example, a "full-blooded Dalmatian" is a Dalmatian with no other breeds in its ancestry.

2. **People:**  Historically, it was used to refer to individuals of a particular race or ethnicity without any admixture of other races. However, this usage is now considered potentially offensive and should be avoided due to its association with racial purity ideologies.

3. **Actions or performances:**  It can describe something done with complete energy, enthusiasm, and vigor.  This is a more common and acceptable modern usage. For example, a "full-blooded performance" implies a powerful and energetic delivery.

It's crucial to consider the context when using "full-blooded" to avoid causing offense.  While the usage concerning animal breeds remains acceptable, the usage relating to human race should be replaced with more appropriate and sensitive phrasing such as "of pure [ethnic group] descent" or similar alternatives.
