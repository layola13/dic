词源:

The word "misprisal" comes from Anglo-Norman French *mespris*, meaning "contempt," "disregard," or "neglect."  This in turn derives from the Old French *mespris*, composed of the prefix *mes-* (meaning "mis-," "badly," or "ill-") and the verb *pris*, the past participle of *prendre*, meaning "to take."  Therefore, the original meaning was essentially "badly taken" or "misunderstood."  The English word evolved through Middle English.
