This term is primarily used in zoology and paleontology, often describing the skeletal structure of certain animals, particularly extinct ones. The word highlights the interconnected nature of the vertebrae, suggesting a strong, rigid spine.  | The fossil shows a plectospondylous vertebral column, indicating a robust and inflexible backbone. = 这块化石显示出互相连接的脊椎骨，表明它拥有强壮而僵硬的脊椎。  The plectospondylous structure provided significant support for the animal's large body. =  这种互相连接的脊椎结构为动物庞大的身躯提供了强大的支撑。 |  fused, interconnected, ankylosed |  segmented, disarticulated
