词源:
From Late Middle English *discursif, from Old French *discursif, from Latin discursus ("a running to and fro, a course, discourse"), from discurrere ("to run about, to roam").  The word ultimately derives from the Latin prefix dis- ("apart, away") and currere ("to run").  The sense evolution reflects the idea of thought moving from point to point in a discussion.
