WORD ORIGIN->
The word "intellected" is derived from the word "intellect," which comes from the Latin word "intellectus," the past participle of "intellegere," meaning "to understand" or "to perceive."  The suffix "-ed" transforms the noun "intellect" into an adjective, describing something possessing or characterized by intellect.
