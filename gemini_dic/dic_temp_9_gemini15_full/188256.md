The word "roytish" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries or etymological resources.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a dialectal word, or a proper noun (perhaps a name or place) not widely known.

To provide a helpful response, please double-check the spelling or provide more context about where you encountered this word.  With more information, I can potentially offer suggestions on what the intended word might be.
