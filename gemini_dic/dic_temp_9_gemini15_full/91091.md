/hw/  does not represent a single word in English.  It's a phonetic transcription representing the sound at the beginning of words like "what," "when," "where," and "which."  Therefore, I cannot provide a word analysis in the requested format for "{hw}".  To provide a helpful response, I need a specific English word.  Please provide a word that begins with the /hw/ sound.
