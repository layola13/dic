词性:名词


词源:  From Old French *equipage, from equiper "to equip," from Latin  *equipare "to make equal," from aequus "equal" + parare "to prepare."  The sense evolved from "preparation," "equipment," to specifically "a carriage and its horses" and then broadened again to include other types of equipment.
