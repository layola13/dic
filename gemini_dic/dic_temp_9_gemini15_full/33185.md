词源:
The word "chromolithographer" is a combination of three elements:

* **chromo-**: from Greek "chroma," meaning "color."
* **litho-**: from Greek "lithos," meaning "stone."
* **-grapher**: from Greek "-graphein," meaning "to write" or "to draw," often used as a suffix to indicate a person who creates or works with something.


Therefore, a "chromolithographer" is literally someone who writes or draws with colored stones (referencing the lithographic stones used in the process).
