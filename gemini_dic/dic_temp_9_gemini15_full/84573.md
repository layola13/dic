词源:  The word "hammily" isn't found in standard dictionaries and appears to be a relatively recent and informal coinage. It's likely formed by adding the adverbial suffix "-ly" to a base that evokes a sense of family or home ("hamm" possibly suggesting "home" or "family," though this is speculative).  Its meaning is clearly derived from the concept of a harmonious family environment.
