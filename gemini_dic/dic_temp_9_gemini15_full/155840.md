词源:  The word "phosphoresce" originates from the combination of "phosphorus" (referring to the element phosphorus, known for its ability to glow in the dark) and the suffix "-escent," meaning "becoming," "growing," or "tending to."  Therefore, "phosphoresce" literally means "to become phosphorescent," or "to glow like phosphorus."
