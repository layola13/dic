PHRASE->
There is no readily available common phrase specifically using "nondiscursiveness".  The concept is usually expressed through descriptive phrases like:  "to the point", "concisely written", "straight to the point", "brief and clear", "succinctly stated".

词源:
The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), "discursive" (meaning "passing from one topic to another; rambling; digressive"), and the suffix "-ness" (forming nouns of state or quality).  Therefore, "nondiscursiveness" literally means "the state or quality of not being discursive."
