The word "invillaged" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word, or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need to consider possibilities:

**Possibility 1: Misspelling**

If "invillaged" is a misspelling, it could be one of the following:

* **envillaged:** This word is not common, but could be formed by analogy with words like "ensconced" or "enthroned." It might imply "settled in a village" or "made part of a village."  Even then, it would need further context for proper definition.

* **invillaged (as a verb):** This would imply a newly coined verb, perhaps meaning "to bring into or place within a village" or "to integrate into a village community."

If you can provide the context in which you encountered this word, a more accurate analysis may be possible.


**Possibility 2:  Newly Coined Word (Neologism)**

If it's a newly coined word, we'd need the context to understand its intended meaning.  The creator might have given it a specific definition within a particular work or community.


Without further context, I cannot provide the requested analysis including pronunciation, part of speech, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc.  Please provide more information.
