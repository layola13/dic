词源:
The word "petrochemical" is a blend of "petroleum" and "chemical".  "Petroleum" comes from the Latin words "petra" (rock) and "oleum" (oil), literally meaning "rock oil". "Chemical" derives from the word "alchemy," which evolved into the modern science of chemistry.  Therefore, petrochemical literally refers to chemicals derived from rock oil.
