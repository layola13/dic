词源:
The word "displacement" comes from the Old French word "desplacemant," which is derived from the verb "desplacer," meaning "to displace."  This ultimately comes from the Latin prefix "dis-" (away, apart) and "placere" (to place).  Therefore, the core meaning is "to move something away from its place."
