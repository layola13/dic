词源：From Medieval Latin genealogia, from Late Greek γενεαλογία (genealogía), from γένος (génos, "race, kind") + -λογία (-logía, "-logy").  The Greek word ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *gene-, meaning "to give birth," "to beget," which also underlies words like "generate" and "genesis."
