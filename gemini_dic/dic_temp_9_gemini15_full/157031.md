词源:
The word "piloted" comes from the word "pilot," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "pilote," meaning "guide, steersman."  This in turn may have originated from a  Late Latin word, possibly related to the Greek word "pēlos," meaning "mud" or "clay," suggesting a connection to early navigation near coastlines. The nautical sense evolved, and subsequently, the aviation sense followed.
