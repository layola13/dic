endosmotic: /ˌɛndoʊˈzmɑːtɪk/ | adj. | 内渗的；内吸的 | Relating to or characterized by endosmosis, the passage of a fluid through a semipermeable membrane into a cell or vessel.  | Example: The endosmotic pressure within the cell caused it to swell.  细胞内的内渗压导致它膨胀。 | 近义词: inward-moving, inwardly directed  | 反义词: exosmotic


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The endosmotic pressure is high. = 内渗压很高。
This process is endosmotic in nature. = 这个过程本质上是内渗的。

一般过去时:
The endosmotic pressure was measured. = 内渗压被测量了。
The cell exhibited endosmotic behavior. = 细胞表现出内渗行为。

现在完成时:
Scientists have studied endosmotic processes. = 科学家们已经研究了内渗过程。
The experiment has demonstrated endosmotic flow. = 实验已经证明了内渗流动。

过去完成时:
The cell had already reached its endosmotic limit. = 细胞已经达到了它的内渗极限。
Before the experiment, they had considered endosmotic effects. = 在实验之前，他们已经考虑了内渗效应。

将来时:
We will measure the endosmotic potential. = 我们将测量内渗势。
The researchers will investigate endosmotic transport. = 研究人员将研究内渗转运。


虚拟语气:
If the membrane were permeable, the endosmotic flow would be greater. = 如果膜是可渗透的，内渗流量会更大。
It is crucial that the endosmotic pressure be carefully controlled. = 仔细控制内渗压至关重要。

被动语态:
The endosmotic pressure was carefully monitored. = 内渗压被仔细监测。
The results were interpreted in terms of endosmotic forces. = 结果是用内渗力来解释的。

疑问句:
Is this process endosmotic or exosmotic? = 这个过程是内渗还是外渗？
What factors influence endosmotic flow? = 哪些因素影响内渗流动？

否定句:
The pressure was not purely endosmotic. = 压力并非纯粹是内渗的。
There was no significant endosmotic effect observed. = 没有观察到明显的内渗效应。


PHRASE->
endosmotic potential = 内渗势
endosmotic pressure = 内渗压
endosmotic flow = 内渗流
endosmotic current = 内渗电流
endosmotic transport = 内渗转运
