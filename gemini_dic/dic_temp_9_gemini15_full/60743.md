electrod:/ˈɛləktrɒd/| n. |电极|An electrode is a conductor (usually a metal) used to make electrical contact with a non-metallic part of a circuit (such as an electrolyte, semiconductor, vacuum, etc.).  It's a vital component in many electrical devices and processes, facilitating the flow of electric current.|Example: The experiment required precise placement of the electrodes in the solution.  实验需要精确地将电极放置在溶液中。|近义词：terminal, pole, contact|反义词：insulator


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The electrode conducts electricity. = 电极导电。
The electrodes are connected to the battery. = 电极连接到电池上。


一般过去时:
The scientist connected the electrodes to the circuit. = 科学家将电极连接到电路中。
The electrodes were immersed in the solution. = 电极浸没在溶液中。


现在完成时:
We have tested the electrodes thoroughly. = 我们已经彻底测试了电极。
The engineers have installed new electrodes in the system. = 工程师们已经在系统中安装了新的电极。


过去完成时:
The experiment had already begun before the electrodes were connected. = 在电极连接之前，实验已经开始了。
They had replaced the damaged electrodes before resuming the experiment. = 他们在恢复实验之前更换了损坏的电极。


将来时:
The technician will install the electrodes tomorrow. = 技术人员明天将安装电极。
We will use different electrodes for the next experiment. = 我们将在下一次实验中使用不同的电极。


虚拟语气:
If we had better electrodes, the results would be more accurate. = 如果我们有更好的电极，结果会更准确。
I wish the electrodes were more durable. = 我希望电极更耐用。


被动语态:
The electrodes were carefully cleaned before use. = 电极在使用前经过仔细清洁。
The electrodes are being monitored for any signs of damage. = 正在监测电极是否有任何损坏迹象。


疑问句:
Are the electrodes properly connected? = 电极连接正确吗？
What type of electrodes are being used in this process? = 在这个过程中使用什么类型的电极？


否定句:
The electrodes did not make good contact. = 电极接触不良。
We did not use the correct electrodes for the experiment. = 我们没有为实验使用正确的电极。
