gonosome:/ˈɡoʊnəˌsoʊm/| n. |生殖体，生殖细胞|A gono-some is a reproductive cell or structure, specifically referring to the gametes (sperm and egg cells) or structures involved in their formation or transfer.  It encompasses the entire reproductive system of some organisms.|Example: The study focused on the development of the gono-some in the early stages of the organism's life cycle.  研究的重点是该生物生命早期阶段生殖体的发育。|近义词：gamete, germ cell |反义词：somatocyte (somatic cell)
