This word is a relatively uncommon neologism, a newly coined word. It's formed by combining:

* **non-**: a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of"
* **rationalistic**: an adjective derived from "rationalism," a philosophical stance emphasizing reason and logic as the primary sources of knowledge and justification.  "Rationalistic" itself is derived from "rational" + "-istic," a suffix indicating a characteristic or adherent of something.  "Rational" originates from the Latin "ratio," meaning "reason."


Therefore, the word's etymology traces back to the Latin "ratio" through the development of "rational," "rationalism," "rationalistic," and finally, "nonrationalistical."  There is no extensive historical usage to analyze as it's a less frequently used term. Its meaning is clearly derived from its component parts.
