词源：

The word "hotspur" originates from the 14th century.  It literally means a "spur that is hot," referring to a spur heated to a red glow to encourage a horse to run faster.  This metaphorical meaning evolved to describe a person who is fiery, impetuous, and easily provoked into action.  The usage was solidified through Shakespeare's play *Henry IV, Part 1*, where Hotspur is a key character known for his aggressive and impulsive temperament.
