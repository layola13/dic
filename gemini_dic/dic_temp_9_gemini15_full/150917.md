parallelization: /ˌpærəlelaɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 并行化 | The process of dividing a task into multiple subtasks that can be executed concurrently, typically on multiple processors or cores, to improve performance.  It aims to reduce the overall execution time by exploiting parallelism. | Example: The parallelization of the algorithm significantly reduced processing time. 并行化算法显著减少了处理时间。| 近义词：concurrency, parallel processing | 反义词：serialization, sequential processing
