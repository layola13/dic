Etymology:

The word "distaff" has its roots in Old English "distef," which itself is derived from "dis" (meaning "female") and "stæf" (meaning "stick").  This reflects its original meaning as the stick used in spinning, a traditionally female occupation.  The association with women and feminine lineage developed from this historical context.


Usage:


The word "distaff" is relatively uncommon in modern English.  Its primary uses are:


1.  **As a noun referring to the spinning stick:** This usage is largely archaic, though it can still be found in historical texts or specialized contexts related to textiles or crafts.


    Example:  The spinner expertly manipulated the distaff, drawing out the fibers to create a fine thread.  纺纱工熟练地操作纺锤，拉出纤维以制造细线。


2.  **Figuratively, to refer to the female line of a family:**  This is a more common modern usage, although still somewhat formal or literary.


    Example:  She inherited the family's artistic talent through the distaff side. 她通过母系继承了家族的艺术天赋。


3.  **More broadly, referring to women or women's work/concerns:** This usage is also less frequent but can be encountered in contexts discussing gender roles or history.


    Example:  The lecture focused on the contributions of women to society, exploring issues traditionally associated with the distaff.  讲座的重点是妇女对社会的贡献，探讨传统上与妇女相关的议题。


Phrases:

There are few common phrases specifically using "distaff."  The word's usage often implies the related concepts of women, family lineage, or traditional female roles rather than appearing in fixed expressions.
