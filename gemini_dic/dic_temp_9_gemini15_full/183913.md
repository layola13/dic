The word "reserate" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it in major resources like Merriam-Webster, Oxford English Dictionary, or Cambridge Dictionary.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized field.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.

To help, if you could provide context where you encountered this word (e.g., a sentence, a document, a specific field), it might be possible to determine its intended meaning or the correct spelling.  It might be a typo of a similar-sounding word.
