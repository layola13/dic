词源:  The word "reverie" comes from the Old French word "riverie," meaning "dreaming," which in turn is derived from the verb "rever," meaning "to dream."  The ultimate origin is likely from the Latin verb "reverti," meaning "to turn back" or "to return," suggesting a turning back of the mind to thoughts and images of the past or to imagined scenarios.
