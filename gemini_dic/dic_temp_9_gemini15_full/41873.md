The word "cosen" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a very rare, archaic, or dialectal word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  To help you, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered "cosen."
