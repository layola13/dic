词源:

The word "deceitfulnesses" is derived from the adjective "deceitful"  (meaning dishonest or misleading), which in turn comes from the noun "deceit" (the act of deceiving).  The suffix "-ful" transforms the noun into an adjective, and the suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, denoting the quality or state of being deceitful. The final "-es" is the standard plural suffix in English. Therefore, "deceitfulnesses" is the plural form of the noun describing multiple instances of deceit.
