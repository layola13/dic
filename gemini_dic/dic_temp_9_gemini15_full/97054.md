词源:
The word "inference" comes from the Latin word "inferre," meaning "to bring in," "to carry in," or "to deduce."  It's related to the prefix "in-" (into) and "ferre" (to carry or bear).  The meaning evolved from the literal act of carrying something in to the intellectual act of bringing in or deducing a conclusion.
