Word Origin:
The word "radio-opaque" is a compound word.  "Radio-" comes from the Latin "radius," meaning "ray," referring to radiation. "Opaque" comes from the Latin "opacus," meaning "darkened, shaded," implying something that does not allow light (and in this case, radiation) to pass through.  Therefore, "radio-opaque" literally means "not allowing radiation to pass through."
