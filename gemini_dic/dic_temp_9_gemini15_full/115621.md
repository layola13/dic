词源:
The word "march" comes from Old French "marcher" and ultimately from Vulgar Latin "*marchare," meaning "to walk, go, travel."  The connection to the month of March is due to the Roman god Mars, the god of war, whose month it was.  The military sense of "march" developed from the association of the month with military activity.
