The word "outacts" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of another word.  Could you please double-check the spelling?

2. **A neologism or jargon:** It might be a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field or community.  If this is the case, please provide context.

3. **A proper noun:**  It might be a proper noun (like a name or place).  Again, context is needed.


To provide you with the analysis you requested, I need the correct spelling or more information about the word's usage.
