词源:
The word "junketer" derives from the obsolete English word "junket," meaning a sweet dessert or a feast.  Over time, the word's meaning shifted to refer to a pleasure trip, often one involving lavish spending, and eventually to those who take such trips, particularly when funded by public money.  The evolution reflects a change in societal perception – from a simple celebratory event to an activity potentially involving questionable use of funds.
