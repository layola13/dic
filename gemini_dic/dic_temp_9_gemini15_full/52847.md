dimensionally:/daɪˈmɛnʃənəli/ | adv. |  维度地；尺度地 |  In a manner relating to dimensions; concerning the dimensions of something.  It describes something in terms of its dimensions or how it relates to size, scale, or extent. |  The model was dimensionally accurate.  模型在尺寸上是精确的。The design is dimensionally unstable.  这个设计在尺寸上是不稳定的。|  proportionally, spatially |  dimensionlessly (反义词并非完全相反，而是指不考虑维度)


USAGE->
