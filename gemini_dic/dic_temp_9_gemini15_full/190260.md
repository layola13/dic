词源:

The word "sappiest" is the superlative form of "sappy," which ultimately derives from "sap," meaning the juice of a plant.  The figurative use of "sappy" to describe someone as overly sentimental likely arose from the association of sap with something overly sweet or sugary, and hence, overly emotional.
