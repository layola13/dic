词源:  The word "unexpected" is formed from the prefix "un-" (meaning "not") and the word "expected."  "Expect" comes from the Old French "esperer," meaning "to wait for, to hope for," ultimately deriving from the Latin "exspectare," which combines "ex-" (out, from) and "spectare" (to look, to watch).  Therefore, "unexpected" literally means "not looked for" or "not anticipated."
