micrometers:/maɪˈkrɒmɪtərz/ | n. |微米 | A micrometer is a unit of length equal to one millionth of a meter (10⁻⁶ meter).  It's often used to measure very small objects or distances, especially in science and engineering.  | The thickness of a human hair is approximately 50 micrometers. 人类头发的厚度大约是 50 微米。

The diameter of a red blood cell is about 7 micrometers. 红血细胞的直径约为 7 微米。| nanometers, millimeters | kilometers |
