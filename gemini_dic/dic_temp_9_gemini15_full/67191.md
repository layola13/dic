词源:

The word "expressible" is derived from the verb "express," ultimately from the Latin word "exprimere," meaning "to press out," "to squeeze out," or "to represent."  The suffix "-ible" indicates capability or possibility.  Therefore, "expressible" means capable of being pressed out or represented, i.e., expressed.
