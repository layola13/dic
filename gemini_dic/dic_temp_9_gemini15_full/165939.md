The word "preoverthrew" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a nonce word, a newly coined word formed by combining "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance of") and "overthrew" (the past tense of "overthrow").  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  I can, however, analyze the constituent parts:


**pre-:**

/prɪ/ | prefix | 前，预先，在…之前 |  Indicates something that happens before or in advance of something else. | Example:  pre-game warm-up (赛前热身) | N/A | post- | prefix


**overthrew:**

/ˌoʊvərˈθruː/ | verb | 推翻，打倒，颠覆 | To violently remove (a ruler or government) from power.  | Example: The rebels overthrew the dictator. (叛军推翻了独裁者。) | overthrow, depose, oust | uphold, establish | verb


**Hypothetical "preoverthrew":**

If "preoverthrew" were to be used (which is highly unusual), it would likely function as a verb, suggesting an attempt to overthrow something before the main event, or actions taken in preparation for an overthrow.  However, without context, its meaning is ambiguous.
