词源:

The word "campground" is a compound word formed from "camp" and "ground."  "Camp" comes from the Latin "campus," meaning "field" or "plain," referring to a place where troops were stationed or where activities were held. "Ground" is from the Old English "grund," meaning "earth" or "soil."  Therefore, "campground" literally means "the ground where a camp is located."
