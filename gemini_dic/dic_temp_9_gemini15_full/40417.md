Word Origin:

The word "contrapuntal" derives from the word "counterpoint," which itself comes from the Medieval Latin "contrapunctus".  "Contra" means "against" or "opposite," and "punctus" refers to a "point" or a melodic note.  Therefore, counterpoint literally means "against point," implying the simultaneous presentation of independent melodic lines.  "-al" is a suffix forming adjectives.
