词源:
The word "Sardinians" comes from the island of Sardinia, located in the Mediterranean Sea.  The name "Sardinia" has a somewhat uncertain etymology, but likely derives from ancient Phoenician or Punic roots, possibly referring to the abundance of a specific type of fish (sardines) found in the surrounding waters.  The suffix "-ians" is a common way to form the plural of a nationality or group of people associated with a place.
