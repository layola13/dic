diamine:/ˈdaɪæmiːn/| n. |二胺|A diamine is an organic compound containing two amine groups (-NH2).  They are used extensively in various industrial applications, including the production of polymers, resins, and pharmaceuticals. Diamine molecules can be linear or cyclic, and their properties vary greatly depending on the structure and substitution of the amine groups.| Example: Ethylenediamine is a common diamine used as a chelating agent and in the production of polyamides.|近义词: diamines (plural form)|反义词:  (No direct antonym, but compounds with fewer or no amine groups could be considered contrasting.)
