feeler-gauge: /ˈfiːlərɡeɪdʒ/ | n. | 塞尺；厚度规 | A feeler gauge is a precision measuring instrument used to measure small gaps or clearances between two surfaces. It typically consists of a set of thin, flat blades of varying thicknesses, each with a clearly marked thickness.  The blades are inserted into the gap to be measured, and the thickness of the blade that just fits is the measurement of the gap.  |  例句：The mechanic used a feeler gauge to check the spark plug gap. 机械师用塞尺检查火花塞间隙。

例句：We used a feeler gauge to measure the clearance between the piston and the cylinder wall. 我们用塞尺测量活塞和汽缸壁之间的间隙。
