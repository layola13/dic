词源:

The word "jam" ultimately derives from the Middle Dutch word "jammen," meaning "to strike, beat, press."  This evolved into the English word, retaining senses of compression and obstruction. The sense of a sweet fruit preserve developed later, likely referencing the act of pressing fruit together to make the spread.
