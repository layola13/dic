interoscillating: /ˌɪntərˈɒsɪleɪtɪŋ/ | adj. | 交替振荡的；相互振荡的 |  Describes something that oscillates (moves back and forth rhythmically) in an alternating or reciprocal manner.  It suggests a mutual or interacting oscillation between two or more things. | Example: The two pendulums exhibited interoscillating movements, their swings influencing each other.  两个钟摆表现出相互振荡的运动，它们的摆动互相影响。 | 近义词: reciprocating, alternating, mutually oscillating | 反义词: stationary, static, unidirectional


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The two systems interoscillate constantly. = 两个系统不断地相互振荡。
The pendulums interoscillate in a predictable pattern. = 钟摆以可预测的模式相互振荡。


一般过去时:
The circuits interoscillated during the experiment. = 电路在实验过程中相互振荡。
The two masses interoscillated with increasing amplitude. = 两个物体以越来越大的振幅相互振荡。


现在完成时:
The coupled oscillators have interoscillated since the system was initiated. = 自系统启动以来，耦合振荡器一直在相互振荡。
The researchers have observed that the particles interoscillated under specific conditions. = 研究人员观察到粒子在特定条件下相互振荡。


过去完成时:
Before the failure, the components had interoscillated smoothly. = 在故障之前，组件平稳地相互振荡。
The system had interoscillated for hours before the anomaly was detected. = 系统在异常被检测到之前已经相互振荡了数小时。


将来时:
The resonators will interoscillate at a specific frequency. = 谐振器将在特定频率下相互振荡。
The coupled systems will interoscillate once the power is applied. = 一旦通电，耦合系统将相互振荡。


虚拟语气:
If the conditions were different, the systems would interoscillate more rapidly. = 如果条件不同，系统将更快地相互振荡。
It is essential that the two components interoscillate in harmony. = 至关重要的是两个组件和谐地相互振荡。


被动语态:
The interoscillating behavior was carefully monitored. = 仔细监测了相互振荡的行为。
The interoscillation was induced by an external force. = 相互振荡是由外力引起的。


疑问句:
Do the two pendulums interoscillate? = 这两个钟摆是否相互振荡？
How do these coupled oscillators interoscillate? = 这些耦合振荡器是如何相互振荡的？


否定句:
The components did not interoscillate as expected. = 组件没有按预期相互振荡。
The system failed to interoscillate under those conditions. = 系统在这些条件下未能相互振荡。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "interoscillating". The word itself is quite technical and is usually used in scientific contexts without phrasal combinations.  Instead, phrases describing the *effect* of interoscillation would be used.  Examples would include:  "coupled oscillators", "mutual oscillation", "resonant interaction", "feedback loop", "energy transfer".
