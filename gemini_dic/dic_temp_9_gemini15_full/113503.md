词源:

The letter "m" originates from the Phoenician letter mem (𐤌), which in turn derives from an earlier Proto-Semitic hieroglyphic that represented water. The sound associated with the letter evolved and eventually became the "m" sound we know today.  The Roman numeral "M" representing 1000 is derived from the Latin word "mille" meaning "thousand".
