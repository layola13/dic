glycocholic: /ˌɡlaɪkoʊˈkɒlɪk/ | n. | 甘胆酸 | Glycocholic acid is a bile acid. It is formed in the liver from cholic acid and glycine. It is one of the major bile acids found in bile.  | Example:  The study investigated the role of glycocholic acid in digestion. 这项研究调查了甘胆酸在消化中的作用。 | 近义词：cholic acid (胆酸), taurocholic acid (牛磺胆酸) | 反义词：无

PHRASE->
Glycocholic acid synthesis = 甘胆酸合成
Glycocholic acid metabolism = 甘胆酸代谢
Glycocholic acid concentration = 甘胆酸浓度
Role of glycocholic acid = 甘胆酸的作用
Effects of glycocholic acid = 甘胆酸的影响


词源:
The word "glycocholic" is derived from "glyco-" (from Greek γλυκύς, glykys, meaning "sweet") referring to the presence of glycine, and "-cholic" (from Greek χολή, cholē, meaning "bile"), indicating its presence in bile.  Thus, it literally means "sweet bile acid".
