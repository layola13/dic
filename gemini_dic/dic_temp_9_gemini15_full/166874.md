词源:
The word "pressurised" comes from the verb "pressurise" (or "pressurize" in American English), which is formed by adding the suffix "-ise" /-ize/ to the noun "pressure".  "Pressure" itself has roots in the Latin word "pressura," meaning "a pressing."  Therefore, "pressurised" literally means "subjected to pressure."
