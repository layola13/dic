/nɒnˌprezəˈveɪʃən/ | n. | 非保存；未保存；不保存 | The lack of nonpreservations in the museum's collection is a matter of concern.  博物馆藏品中缺乏非保存物品令人担忧。| 近义词：loss, destruction, decay | 反义词：preservation, conservation |  名词


The word "nonpreservations" is not a standard English word found in dictionaries. It's a newly coined term, likely formed by adding the prefix "non-" to "preservation."  Therefore, a proper definition and usage must be inferred from the context in which it appears.


Given that "preservation" means the act of preserving something, "nonpreservation" would logically mean the *absence* or *lack* of preservation, or the state of not being preserved.  It implies deterioration, loss, or destruction.  


**Possible Usage (Hypothetical, based on the meaning of the component parts):**

Because this word is not standard, providing grammatical examples is largely hypothetical.  The usage would depend entirely on the context and intended meaning.  Here are some *possible* examples based on the likely intended meaning:

* **Example 1 (as a noun):** "The museum director lamented the high rate of nonpreservation among the artifacts."  (博物馆馆长对文物中高比例的未保存情况表示遗憾。)

* **Example 2 (as a noun in a more abstract context):** "The nonpreservation of traditional values led to social unrest." (传统价值观的缺失导致了社会动荡。)


**Word Formation:**

The word is formed by combining:

* **non-:** A prefix meaning "not" or "the opposite of."
* **preservation:**  The act of preserving something; keeping something in its original state.  It originates from the Old French word *preservacion*, from *preserver* (to preserve), ultimately from Latin *preservare* ("to guard, protect, keep").


**Note:**  Since "nonpreservations" is not a standard word, its use should be approached cautiously.  Consider using more common and clearer alternatives like "lack of preservation," "destruction," "loss," or "decay," depending on the specific context.
