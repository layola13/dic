词源:
The word "lowdown" likely originated in African American Vernacular English (AAVE). While the exact etymology is uncertain, it's believed to have emerged in the late 19th or early 20th century.  The "low" part might refer to something being "low" in terms of being hidden or secretive, while "down" might signify the full story or the complete truth.  Its use evolved to encompass both the literal and figurative meaning we understand today.
