Etymology:

The word "muskox" is a compound word.  "Musk" refers to the strong musky odor emitted by the animal, particularly the males.  "Ox" refers to its bovine appearance. The plural "muskoxes" is formed regularly by adding "-es" to the singular.  The word's origins ultimately trace back to Old Norse and Proto-Germanic roots describing similar large, horned animals.
