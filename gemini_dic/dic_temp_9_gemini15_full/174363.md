quicksort:/ˈkwɪksɔːrt/ | n. |快速排序|A highly efficient sorting algorithm that works by recursively partitioning a list into sublists, placing a pivot element in its correct sorted position, and then recursively sorting the sublists.|Example: Quicksort is often used in practice due to its average-case time complexity of O(n log n).  快速排序由于其平均时间复杂度为O(n log n)，因此经常在实践中使用。|mergesort, heapsort|bubblesort, insertionsort|n.
