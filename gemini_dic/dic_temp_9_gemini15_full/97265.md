词源:
The word "inflorescence" comes from the Late Latin word *inflorescentia*, a combination of the prefix *in-* (meaning "in" or "into") and *florescere* (meaning "to blossom" or "to bloom").  It literally means "the act of blossoming" or "the state of being in blossom," but has come to refer specifically to the clustered arrangement of flowers.
