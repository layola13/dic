词源:  Derived from the adjective "discreet," which comes from the Old French word "discret," meaning "separate, distinct."  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb.  The root meaning relates to the idea of separating oneself or one's actions from public view, hence the sense of secrecy and caution.
