词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin, meaning "as if," "as it were," "seemingly," or "almost."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation, but not a complete identity.

* **patiently**: From the adjective "patient," ultimately derived from the Old French "pacient" and the Latin "patiens," meaning "suffering" or "enduring."  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb.
