词源:  The word "sealifting" is a compound word.  "Sea" refers to the ocean, and "lifting" refers to the act of raising or moving something.  Therefore, "sealifting" literally means lifting something from or onto a sea vessel.  It is a relatively modern term, arising with the increased complexity and scale of maritime transport.
