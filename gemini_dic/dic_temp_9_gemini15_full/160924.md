It often implies a stage of analysis, interpretation, or further manipulation of data or images that were previously organized in a mosaic pattern.  The term is frequently used in contexts related to image processing, data analysis, and genome sequencing. | Example: Post-mosaic analysis revealed significant variations in gene expression across different regions of the genome.  后马赛克分析揭示了基因组不同区域基因表达的显著差异。|近义词：post-assembly, subsequent, following|反义词：pre-mosaic, prior to
