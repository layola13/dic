It's the precursor to the scolex, the mature head structure of the adult worm.|Example:  The ingested cysticercus developed into a protoscolex in the pig's intestine.|近义词: scolex (mature form), cysticercus (earlier larval stage)|反义词: N/A

一般过去时:
The researchers observed the protoscolex under a microscope. = 研究人员在显微镜下观察了原头节。
The pig consumed food containing protoscolices. = 猪食用了含有原头节的食物。

现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the development of protoscolices extensively. = 科学家们已经广泛研究了原头节的发育。
We have identified several types of protoscolices in this sample. = 我们在这个样本中鉴定了几种类型的原头节。

过去完成时:
The protoscolex had already developed hooks before the infection was detected. = 在感染被发现之前，原头节已经发育出钩子了。
The tapeworm had released numerous protoscolices into the host’s intestine. = 绦虫已经释放了大量的原头节到宿主的肠道中。

将来时:
The protoscolex will mature into a scolex within a week. = 原头节将在一个星期内成熟为头节。
This treatment will hopefully prevent protoscolex formation. = 这种治疗有望预防原头节的形成。

虚拟语气:
If the protoscolex were fully developed, it would be easily identifiable. = 如果原头节完全发育，它将很容易识别。
It is important that the protoscolex not be ingested. = 原头节不被摄入是很重要的。

被动语态:
The protoscolex was examined using electron microscopy. = 原头节使用电子显微镜进行检查。

疑问句:
What are the characteristics of this protoscolex? = 这个原头节的特征是什么？
How many protoscolices were found in the sample? = 在样本中发现了多少个原头节？

否定句:
The sample did not contain any visible protoscolices. = 样本中没有发现任何可见的原头节。
This species does not produce protoscolices in the same way as others. = 这个物种不像其他物种那样产生原头节。
