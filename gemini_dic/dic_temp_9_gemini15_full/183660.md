The word "rereminded" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a very rare neologism.  There's no entry for it in standard dictionaries.  It seems to be an attempt to create a word meaning "reminded again," or "reminded repeatedly."

To analyze it, let's break down its likely intended components:

* **re-:** A prefix meaning "again" or "back."
* **remind:** A verb meaning "to cause someone to remember something."
* **-ed:** The past tense suffix of a regular verb.

Therefore, a proper way to express the intended meaning would be "reminded again" or "repeatedly reminded."

Since "rereminded" isn't a real word, I cannot provide the requested information in the specified format.  I can, however, offer information on the word "remind" which is the base of the intended neologism:


remind: /rɪˈmaɪnd/ | vt. | 提醒，使想起 | To cause someone to remember something. |  He reminded me of my appointment. 他提醒了我我的约会。 | She reminded him to lock the door. 她提醒他锁门。 | recall, remember | forget
