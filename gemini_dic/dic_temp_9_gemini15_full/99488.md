Word Origin:

The word "interfiltrate" is a combination of "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and "filtrate" (meaning "to pass through a filter,"  originally referring to liquids, but extended figuratively).  The "filtrate" part stems from the Latin "filtrare," related to "filum" (thread).  The idea of passing through or permeating is key to the meaning.
