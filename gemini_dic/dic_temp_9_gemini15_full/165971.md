词源：

The word is a combination of "pre-" (meaning "before") + "parliamentary" (relating to a parliament).  "Parliamentary" itself derives from "parliament," ultimately from the Old French "parlement," meaning "speech, talk, conference."  The evolution reflects the historical development of representative assemblies from informal gatherings to formal institutions.
