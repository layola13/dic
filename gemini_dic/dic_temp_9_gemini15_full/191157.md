词源:  The word "scarecrow" is a compound word.  "Scarecrow" comes from "scare" (to frighten) + "crow" (a type of bird, originally referring to birds generally that prey on crops). Over time, the meaning broadened to include any bird that might raid crops. The term thus described something meant to frighten away crows (and other birds).  The modern meaning evolved to encompass the whole figure used to scare birds, not just the birds themselves.
