USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective and doesn't have verb or noun forms that readily lend themselves to tense conjugation.  Its usage is limited to describing something related to the space or time between seeds. Therefore, standard tense conjugations (present, past, future, etc.) are not applicable in the same way as with common verbs.


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "interseminal."  Its usage is highly specialized.
