词源:
The word "enshroud" comes from the Old English "scrūde," meaning "clothing, garment."  The prefix "en-" means "to put in," "to cover," or "to surround." Therefore, "enshrouded" literally means "covered with a garment" or "wrapped in a shroud," which historically referred to the cloth used to bury the dead.  The modern meaning has broadened to include any covering or concealment.
