kazakhstans:/kæˈzækstænz/| n. |哈萨克斯坦（复数）|The word "kazakhstans" is the plural form of "Kazakhstan," referring to multiple instances or aspects of the country.  It is less commonly used than "Kazakhstans" which is grammatically incorrect.  The correct plural form is still debated, with some sources suggesting "Kazakhstans" and others suggesting using "the Kazakhstani republics" or similar phrasing to avoid the plural. | Example:  Discussions about the various economic policies of the Kazakhstans are ongoing. (Although grammatically questionable, this shows usage.) |近义词:Kazakhstani republics (more grammatically correct alternative) |反义词:None |名词


USAGE->
This word, in its plural form, has limited grammatical correctness and usage.  Therefore, providing tense examples is not practically applicable.  The focus should be on correct usage which avoids the plural altogether.  Instead, phrases like "the various regions of Kazakhstan," or "different aspects of Kazakhstani society" would be preferred.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "kazakhstans".  Instead, phrases would center around Kazakhstan itself, such as:

in Kazakhstan = 在哈萨克斯坦
from Kazakhstan = 来自哈萨克斯坦
people of Kazakhstan = 哈萨克斯坦人民
the culture of Kazakhstan = 哈萨克斯坦文化
the history of Kazakhstan = 哈萨克斯坦的历史
