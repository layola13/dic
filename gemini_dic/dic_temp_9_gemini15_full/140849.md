词源:
The phrase originates from the system of providing unemployment relief, historically known as "the dole," which was prevalent in Britain and other countries.  The word "dole" itself comes from the Old English word "dǣl," meaning "a portion" or "a share."  Over time, it came to specifically refer to the portion of food or money given to the poor or unemployed.
