词源:
The word "porter" ultimately derives from the Old French word "portour," meaning "carrier" or "porter." This, in turn, is related to the Latin word "portare," meaning "to carry."  The "-ing" suffix transforms the noun "porter" into the gerund "porting," denoting the action or process of carrying.
