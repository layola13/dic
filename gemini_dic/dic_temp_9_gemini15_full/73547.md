The word "forespeech" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, grammatical function, meaning, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis following your format.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specialized field.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
