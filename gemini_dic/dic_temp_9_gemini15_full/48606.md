词源:  From the verb "defect," ultimately from the Latin "defectus," past participle of "deficere," meaning "to fail," "to be wanting,"  "to fall short," composed of "de-" (away, down) and "ficere" (to make, to do).  The sense of "abandonment" evolved from the idea of failing to fulfill one's obligations or duties.
