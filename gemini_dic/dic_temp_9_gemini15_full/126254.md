myelencephalic:/ˌmaɪəlɛnˈsɛfəlɪk/| adj. |髓质的；延髓的|Relating to the myelencephalon, the most caudal part of the embryonic brain, which develops into the medulla oblongata.  It describes structures, processes, or conditions associated with this part of the brain.|The myelencephalic region is crucial for vital functions like breathing and heart rate.|近义词：medullary (in this context)|反义词：telencephalic (referring to the opposite end of the brain)
