dartingnesses:/ˈdɑːrtɪŋnəsɪz/| n. |飞奔；闪现；迅速移动的次数|The word "dartingnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a nonce word, meaning a word coined for a specific occasion and not in common usage.  It is formed by adding the plural suffix "-nesses" to "darting," which itself is the present participle of the verb "dart."  Therefore, it attempts to describe multiple instances of darting or quick, sudden movements.  Because it's not a standard word, there are no established synonyms or antonyms, and usage examples would need to be constructed based on its intended meaning. |The multiple dartingnesses of the hummingbird were a blur to the naked eye.  (多次蜂鸟快速飞动，肉眼难以看清。)  The sudden dartingnesses of the fish startled the heron. (鱼的突然窜动吓到了苍鹭。) |  N/A | N/A | noun
