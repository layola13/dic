词源:
The word "karat" comes from the Greek word "κεράτιον" (kerátion), meaning "carob seed."  Carob seeds were historically used as a consistent unit of weight for precious stones and metals because of their relatively uniform size.  The word evolved through Arabic and eventually into its current form.
