centifidous:/ˌsɛntiˈfɪdəs/| adj.|一百裂的，分成一百份的|  This word is a very rare and obscure word, possibly a neologism (newly coined word) or a very specialized term.  It's formed from "centi-" (one hundred) and a root related to "fissure" or "divide," suggesting something divided into one hundred parts.  There is no established dictionary definition or common usage.  Therefore, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage is impossible without further context or confirmation of its existence and meaning in a specific field.  A more common word to express a similar concept would be "centuplicate" (multiplied by a hundred).|例句： (Cannot provide a real-world example due to the word's obscurity.) |近义词：(None readily available) |反义词：(None readily available) |词性:形容词
