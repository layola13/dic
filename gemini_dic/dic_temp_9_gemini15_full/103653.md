The word "jole" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  There is no entry for "jole" in major English dictionaries.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please double-check the spelling.
* **A regional dialect word:** It might be a word used in a specific region or community, not widely known.
* **A newly coined word or slang:**  It could be a very recent addition to the language.
* **A proper noun:** It might be a name or place name.

If you can provide more context (where you encountered the word, a sentence it was used in, etc.), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
