extensivities:/ˌɛkˌstɛnˈsɪvɪtiz/| n. |广延性；广泛性；广阔性|The study of extensivities focuses on properties that are dependent on the size or extent of a system, unlike intensive properties which are independent of size.  Extensivities are additive; the total extensivity of a composite system is the sum of the extensivities of its constituent parts. For example, mass and volume are extensivities.|例句：The extensivities of the gas sample were measured to determine its total mass and volume. = 气体样品的广延性被测量以确定其总质量和体积。


例句：Understanding the extensivities of different materials is crucial in engineering design. = 理解不同材料的广延性对于工程设计至关重要。|近义词：extensity, vastness, breadth, magnitude|反义词：intensivity|词性:noun
