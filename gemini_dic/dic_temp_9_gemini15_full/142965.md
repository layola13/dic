The word "outawes" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  To help you, I need a valid English word.  Perhaps there's a misspelling or it's a neologism (newly coined word) not yet widely recognized. Please double-check the spelling or provide more context.
