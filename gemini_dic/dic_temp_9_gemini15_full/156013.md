photolithotroph: /ˌfoʊtoʊˈlɪθətroʊf/ | n. | 光合自养生物 | An organism that uses light as an energy source and inorganic compounds as a carbon source.  These organisms are photosynthetic but unlike plants, they don't use water as an electron donor, and therefore do not produce oxygen.  They are often found in extreme environments. | Example:  Purple sulfur bacteria are examples of photolithotrophs.  紫硫细菌是光合自养生物的例子。 | 近义词: photoautotroph (if using CO2 as carbon source) | 反义词: chemoheterotroph, photoheterotroph
