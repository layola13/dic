outpleases: /ˌaʊtˈpliːz/ |  v. | 超越……的讨好；胜过……的讨好 |  To surpass in pleasing; to exceed in giving pleasure.  This is not a standard English word. It's a nonce word, meaning it's created for a specific occasion and not found in dictionaries.  It's formed by combining "out-" (meaning "to surpass" or "exceed") and "pleases" (the third-person singular present tense of "please"). |
