词源:
The word "cretinous" is derived from "cretin," which comes from the French word "crétin," ultimately from the Old French "crestin," meaning "Christian."  Historically, the term was used to refer to individuals suffering from cretinism, a condition caused by iodine deficiency resulting in physical and mental retardation. The pejorative use of the word to describe someone as stupid or foolish is a later development, reflecting the association of cretinism with intellectual disability.
