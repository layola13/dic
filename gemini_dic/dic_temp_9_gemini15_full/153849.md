perceptron:/pərˈsɛptrɒn/| n. |感知器|A perceptron is a single-layer neural network that is used in supervised learning.  It is the simplest form of a neural network and is used for binary classification tasks.  It takes multiple inputs, applies weights to them, sums them up, and then applies an activation function to produce an output. The perceptron learning rule is used to adjust the weights to minimize errors. |Example:  The perceptron model successfully classified the images into cats and dogs. 感知器模型成功地将图像分类为猫和狗。 |近义词: neural network (in a simplified context)|反义词:  None (no direct antonym)|n.
