词源:

The word "everlastingness" is derived from the word "everlasting," which is a compound of "ever" and "lasting."

* **ever:**  An adverb meaning "at all times," "always," or "in all cases."  Its roots trace back to Old English "æfre," meaning "always," "ever," or "at any time."

* **lasting:** A present participle adjective meaning "continuing for a long time," "durable," or "permanent." Its roots are in Old English "læstan," meaning "to last," "endure," or "continue."

Therefore, "everlasting" signifies something that lasts forever, and "everlastingness" denotes the quality or state of being everlasting.  The "-ness" suffix is a common English suffix used to create nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.
