词源:  The word "paddock" ultimately derives from the Old English word "padde," meaning a frog or toad. Over time, this evolved into "paddock," likely referring to a small, damp area suitable for such creatures.  The usage shifted to its current meaning of a small, enclosed field, likely because such areas were often damp or marshy.
