词源:
From Late Latin *decimatio, from Latin decimus (“tenth”), from decem (“ten”).  Originally, decimation referred to the Roman military practice of killing one out of every ten soldiers as punishment for mutiny or cowardice. The meaning has broadened over time to encompass any significant reduction or destruction of a population or group.
