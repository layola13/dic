词源:
The word "greatcoat" is a compound word.  "Great" here functions as an intensifier, emphasizing the size and warmth of the coat.  It's ultimately derived from Old English  "grēat," meaning "large" or "big," combined with "coat,"  which has roots stretching back to Old French "cote" and ultimately to Latin "cōta," meaning a "short coat" or "tunic."  The meaning shifted over time to encompass the longer, heavier overcoats we know today.
