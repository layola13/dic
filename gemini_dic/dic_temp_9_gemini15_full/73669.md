词源:
The word "forgery" comes from the Old French word "forgerie," which means "smith's workshop," or "the act of forging metal."  This is because the original meaning of "forge" was related to shaping metal.  The sense of creating something false evolved from this, as forging metal required skill and could be used to create convincing imitations.  The modern English word "forgery" retains the sense of creating a convincing but false imitation.
