routing:/ˈraʊtɪŋ/| n. | 路由，路径规划 | The process of determining the path that data takes across a network.  It involves selecting the best path from a source to a destination based on various factors such as network congestion, distance, and cost. |Example: The network administrator configured the routing protocols to optimize data flow.  网络管理员配置了路由协议以优化数据流。|近义词：pathfinding, directing |反义词：None

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The system automatically routes the traffic. = 系统自动路由流量。
This router routes data packets efficiently. = 此路由器高效地路由数据包。

一般过去时:
The engineer rerouted the traffic after the failure. = 工程师在故障后重新路由了流量。
The network administrator manually routed the packets yesterday. = 网络管理员昨天手动路由了数据包。

现在完成时:
The company has implemented a new routing system. = 公司已经实施了新的路由系统。
We have successfully routed all the data to the server. = 我们已成功将所有数据路由到服务器。

过去完成时:
The system had already routed the data before the outage. = 在中断之前，系统已经路由了数据。
They had optimized the routing protocols before the peak hours. = 他们在高峰时段之前优化了路由协议。

将来时:
The new software will automatically route all incoming calls. = 新软件将自动路由所有来电。
We will implement a dynamic routing algorithm next week. = 我们下周将实施动态路由算法。

虚拟语气:
If the routing protocol failed, the network would be down. = 如果路由协议失败，网络将瘫痪。
I wish the routing configuration were simpler. = 我希望路由配置更简单一些。

被动语态:
The data is routed through multiple servers. = 数据通过多个服务器进行路由。
The traffic was routed to the backup server during the maintenance. = 在维护期间，流量被路由到备份服务器。

疑问句:
How is the data routed through the network? = 数据如何通过网络进行路由？
What routing protocol is used in this network? = 此网络使用什么路由协议？

否定句:
The router did not route the packets correctly. = 路由器没有正确路由数据包。
The data was not routed to the intended destination. = 数据没有路由到预期的目的地。
