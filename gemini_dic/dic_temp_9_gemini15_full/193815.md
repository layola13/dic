词源:

The word is a compound of "self-" (meaning oneself or one's own) and "deserving" (meaning worthy of something).  "Deserving" itself comes from the Old English "deserfian," meaning "to deserve."  The "self-" prefix adds the connotation of self-centeredness and an excessive belief in one's own worthiness.


用法说明:

Self-deserving is primarily used as an adjective to describe a person's attitude or behavior. It's not typically used to describe objects or situations.  The implication is always negative, suggesting a lack of humility and an unwarranted sense of superiority.  It often highlights a disconnect between one's perceived worth and their actual accomplishments or contributions.
