The word "excambie" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries. It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Perhaps you could provide more context where you encountered this word.

2. **It's a neologism:**  A newly coined word, possibly specific to a certain field or community.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language, perhaps misspelled or adapted into English.  Knowing the language of origin would be helpful.

4. **It's a proper noun:** A name or place name.


Without further information, I cannot provide the requested analysis following the specified format.  Please clarify the word's origin or provide more context.
