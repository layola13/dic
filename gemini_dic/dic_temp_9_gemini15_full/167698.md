词源:
The verb "priding" is derived from the noun "pride," which originates from the Old French word "prude"  meaning "proud, haughty," and ultimately from the Latin word "prūdus" with a similar meaning.  The "-ing" ending indicates the present participle form of the verb, often used to express ongoing action or a state of being.
