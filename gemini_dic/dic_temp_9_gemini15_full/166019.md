  The word "prepersuasion" is not a standard dictionary entry. It's a relatively uncommon word formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") with "persuasion."  Therefore, a direct etymological breakdown isn't readily available in the same way it would be for established words. However, we can analyze its components:

* **pre-:**  From Latin *prae*, meaning "before," "in front of," or "ahead of."  This prefix is widely used in English to indicate something that happens or exists before something else.

* **persuasion:** From Old French *persuasion*, ultimately from Latin *persuadere*, meaning "to persuade." This involves influencing someone's beliefs, opinions, or actions.

Therefore, "prepersuasion" logically refers to actions or influences that precede and prepare the ground for later persuasion.  It suggests a subtle, often unconscious, process of shaping attitudes or beliefs before a direct attempt at persuasion takes place.
