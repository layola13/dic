英文解析:  The word "expensivenesses" is a plural noun formed by adding "-es" to the noun "expensiveness."  It refers to multiple instances or aspects of high cost or luxury.  While grammatically correct, it's less common and often considered somewhat awkward due to the already abstract nature of "expensiveness."  A more natural phrasing would often use "high costs," "expenses," or describe specific expensive items or situations.
