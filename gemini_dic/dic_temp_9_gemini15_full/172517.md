pyrheliometer:/ˌpaɪrɪˈhiːliəmɪtər/| n. |日射表，太阳辐射计 |An instrument used to measure the intensity of direct solar radiation.  It typically consists of a receiver that absorbs solar radiation and converts it into a measurable signal, such as a change in temperature or electrical current.  |The pyrheliometer recorded a peak solar radiation intensity of 1000 W/m². 日射表记录到的太阳辐射强度峰值为1000瓦/平方米。  The scientists used a precision pyrheliometer to calibrate their solar energy model. 科学家们使用精密日射表来校准他们的太阳能模型。|actinometer, solar radiometer |  | n.
