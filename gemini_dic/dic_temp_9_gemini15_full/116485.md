词源:
The word "materialize" comes from the Middle French word "matérialiser," which in turn derives from the Late Latin word "materialis," meaning "material" or "of matter."  The suffix "-ize" indicates the act of making something become or resemble something else.  Therefore, "materialize" originally meant to give something a material form.  The modern meaning, encompassing both the creation of something tangible and the unexpected appearance of something, evolved over time.
