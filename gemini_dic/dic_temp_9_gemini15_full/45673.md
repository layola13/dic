curtation:/kɜːˈteɪʃən/| n. |缩短；删节；剪短|The shortening of a word or phrase, often by omission of a syllable or letter.  It's a less common term, often found in linguistic analysis.  For example, the word "photo" is a curtation of "photograph".|例句：The poet employed curtation to create a more rhythmic effect in the verse.  诗人运用缩短手法来创造更具节奏感的诗句。|近义词：abbreviation, shortening, truncation, contraction|反义词：elongation, expansion


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and does not have verb conjugations like "What is...?"  The usage revolves around its meaning as the act of shortening.  Therefore, typical tense examples are not applicable.

例句1: The curtation of "laboratory" to "lab" is a common example of informal language. 将“laboratory”缩写成“lab”是口语中常见的例子。

例句2:  His essay suffered from excessive curtation, losing much of its original meaning. 他的文章因为过度删减而失去了很多原意。


PHRASE->
This word doesn't readily form common phrases in the same way as common words like "what".  Phrases involving "curtation" would be highly specialized and context-dependent, related to linguistics or editing.

For example:  "The stylistic curtation of the text" (文本的风格化删减), "grammatical curtation" (语法上的缩减).  These are not common phrases in everyday conversation.
