WORD ORIGIN->

The word "imperilments" derives from the verb "imperil," which itself comes from the Old French word "empéril," meaning "to endanger."  The suffix "-ments" is a noun suffix indicating a state, condition, or result. Thus, "imperilments" signifies the state of being in danger or the dangers themselves.
