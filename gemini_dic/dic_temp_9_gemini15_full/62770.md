词源:
The word "engrapple" is a combination of the prefix "en-" (meaning "to cause to be in a state of") and the verb "grapple," which originates from the Old English word "graplian," meaning "to seize, grasp, clutch."  Therefore, "engrapple" literally means "to cause to grapple" or "to become engaged in a grapple."  The word evolved to reflect a more intense and determined grasping or struggling.
