WORD ORIGIN->
The word "redeveloper" is a relatively modern term, combining the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") with "developer."  "Developer" itself originates from the verb "develop,"  which comes from the Old French "developper," meaning "to unfold, unroll."  This further traces back to the Latin "dis-" (apart) + "volvere" (to roll). The meaning evolved to encompass the idea of bringing something into being or improving something, which eventually led to its application in real estate.  Therefore, "redeveloper" signifies someone who develops something again, or improves upon existing structures or land.
