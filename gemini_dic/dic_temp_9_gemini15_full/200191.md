词源:

The word "skinflinty" is a compound word, combining "skin" and "flint".  "Flint" is a hard, stony substance that is difficult to break or chip.  The implication is that a skinflinty person is as hard and unyielding as flint when it comes to spending money.  The "skin" element likely reinforces the idea of being tight-fisted and holding onto one's money as closely as possible, like skin clinging to bone.  The origin is somewhat obscure and lacks definitive etymological documentation, but the imagery is clear.
