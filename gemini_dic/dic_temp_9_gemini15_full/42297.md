counter-ion: /ˈkaʊntərˌaɪən/ | n. | 反离子 |  A counter-ion is an ion that balances the charge of another ion in a compound or solution.  It is usually of opposite charge, thus neutralizing the overall charge. For example, in sodium chloride (NaCl), the sodium ion (Na+) is the counter-ion to the chloride ion (Cl-), and vice-versa. | Example: In a solution of sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄), the sodium ions (Na+) act as counter-ions to the sulfate ion (SO₄²⁻).  In this case, two sodium ions are needed to balance the 2- charge of the sulfate ion.  |近义词：balancing ion | 反义词：co-ion | 词性:n.


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in chemistry and related fields, so tense conjugation examples are less relevant than examples demonstrating its usage in different contexts.  Examples below illustrate its usage in different chemical contexts:

Example 1 (Simple Salt):
The sodium ion is the counter-ion to the chloride ion in sodium chloride. = 在氯化钠中，钠离子是氯离子的反离子。

Example 2 (Complex Ion):
In the complex ion [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻, the potassium ions act as counter-ions. = 在配合离子[Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻中，钾离子充当反离子。

Example 3 (Polyelectrolyte):
The positively charged counter-ions neutralize the negative charge of the polyelectrolyte chain. = 带正电荷的反离子中和了聚电解质链的负电荷。

Example 4 (Colloidal Systems):
The addition of counter-ions can influence the stability of colloidal systems. = 添加反离子会影响胶体系统的稳定性。

Example 5 (Ionic Liquids):
The choice of counter-ion can significantly affect the properties of ionic liquids. = 反离子的选择会显著影响离子液体的性质。
