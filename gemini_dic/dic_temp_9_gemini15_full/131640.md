noncompressible: /ˌnɑːn kəmˈprɛsəbl/ | adj. |不可压缩的|  Incapable of being compressed; resisting compression.  A noncompressible substance maintains a constant volume under pressure. |例句：Water is considered nearly noncompressible. 水被认为几乎不可压缩。

例句：The noncompressible nature of the liquid made it ideal for hydraulic systems. 液体的不可压缩特性使其成为液压系统的理想选择。


近义词：incompressible, unyielding

反义词：compressible, yielding


词性：形容词


词源：

* **non-**:  Prefix meaning "not" or "without."
* **compress-**: From Latin "comprimere," meaning "to press together."
* **-ible**: Suffix indicating capability or susceptibility.


USAGE->
There is no verb conjugation for an adjective.  Adjectives do not change form based on tense.  The usage examples below illustrate how "noncompressible" functions in different sentence structures.


一般现在时:
The fluid is noncompressible. = 该流体不可压缩。
This material is noncompressible under normal conditions. = 在正常条件下，这种材料不可压缩。


一般过去时:
The gas was noncompressible at that temperature. = 在那个温度下，气体是不可压缩的。
The liquid remained noncompressible throughout the experiment. = 在整个实验过程中，液体保持不可压缩。


现在完成时:
The scientists have confirmed that the substance is noncompressible. = 科学家们已经证实该物质不可压缩。
We have found that this material has proven to be noncompressible. = 我们发现这种材料已被证明是不可压缩的。


过去完成时:
The engineers had assumed the material was noncompressible, but they were wrong. = 工程师们曾假设该材料不可压缩，但他们错了。
They had discovered that the previously considered noncompressible substance actually compressed under high pressure. = 他们发现先前被认为不可压缩的物质实际上在高压下会压缩。


将来时:
The new design will use a noncompressible fluid. = 新的设计将使用不可压缩的流体。
The researchers predict that the material will remain noncompressible even at extreme temperatures. = 研究人员预测，即使在极端温度下，该材料仍将保持不可压缩。


虚拟语气:
If the fluid were noncompressible, the calculations would be simpler. = 如果流体不可压缩，计算将会更简单。
It would be ideal if the material were completely noncompressible. = 如果材料完全不可压缩，那就最好了。


被动语态:
The substance is considered noncompressible. = 该物质被认为是不可压缩的。
The material was found to be noncompressible. = 该材料被发现是不可压缩的。


疑问句:
Is the fluid noncompressible? = 该流体不可压缩吗？
Is this material noncompressible under high pressure? = 在高压下，这种材料不可压缩吗？


否定句:
The gas is not noncompressible; it compresses easily. = 气体不是不可压缩的；它很容易压缩。
The substance is not completely noncompressible, showing slight compression under extreme pressure. = 该物质并非完全不可压缩，在极端压力下会略微压缩。



PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "noncompressible". The word is primarily used as a descriptive adjective in scientific and technical contexts.  Phrases would focus on the application rather than the adjective itself. For example:


* noncompressible fluid dynamics
* noncompressible liquid behavior
* noncompressible flow model
* nearly noncompressible material
* effects of noncompressible flow
