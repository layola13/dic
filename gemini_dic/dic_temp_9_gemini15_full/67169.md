词源:

The word "expostulation" comes from the Late Middle English word "expostulacion," which itself is derived from the Late Latin word "expostulatio." This Latin word is formed from the verb "expostulare," meaning "to demand an explanation," "to remonstrate," or "to upbraid."  The prefix "ex-" means "out" or "from," and "postulare" means "to demand" or "to request." Therefore, the root meaning points to a strong and reasoned demand for change or explanation, often involving a degree of reproach.


用法说明:


Expostulation is always used as a noun.  It refers to the act of expostulating, not the person who does the expostulating.

例句：


1. Despite her heartfelt expostulation, he remained stubbornly committed to his plan. 尽管她苦口婆心地规劝，他还是顽固地坚持自己的计划。


2. The teacher's expostulation about the importance of honesty was ignored by the students. 老师关于诚实重要性的劝诫被学生们忽视了。
