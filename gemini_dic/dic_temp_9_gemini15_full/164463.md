词源:  The word "preentailing" is a relatively modern coinage, combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") with "entail," which originally meant "to involve as a necessary consequence"  but has evolved to encompass the idea of something being inherent or inevitable.  The "-ing" suffix makes it a present participle, often used as a gerund or adjective.
