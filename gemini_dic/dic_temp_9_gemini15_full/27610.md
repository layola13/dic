词源:
The word "cancelled" originates from the verb "cancel," which itself comes from the late Middle English word "cancelen,"  ultimately derived from the Latin word "cancellare," meaning "to strike out; to cross out."  The original meaning involved physically marking something out, like crossing out text, and this evolved to the modern sense of annulling or voiding an agreement or event.
