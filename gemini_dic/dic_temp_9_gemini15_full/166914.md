词源:  From Old French *prestig(i)e, from Latin praestigiae "illusion, jugglery," from praestigiātor "juggler," from prae- "before" +  stingere "to prick, to sting," hence "to pierce, to affect, to influence."  The modern meaning developed from the earlier sense of "illusion" to that of "influence" and ultimately "reputation" based on influence and achievement.
