词源:

The word is derived from "multi-" (meaning many) + "dimensionality" (the state or quality of having dimensions).  "Dimensionality" itself comes from "dimension" (a measurable extent of something, such as length, breadth, or height; a measurable aspect of a situation or problem), ultimately tracing back to Latin "dimensiō" (measurement).
