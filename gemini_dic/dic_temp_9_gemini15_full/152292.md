词源: The word "patter" itself comes from Middle English "patren," meaning to speak rapidly or glibly.  This in turn likely derives from Old French "patrer," with uncertain ultimate origins but potentially linked to words suggesting rapid or repeated sounds.  The "-er" suffix is added to create the noun form indicating a person who performs the action.
