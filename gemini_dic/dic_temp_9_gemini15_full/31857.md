词源:
The word "cheerfully" is derived from the Old English word "cēare," meaning "joy" or "gladness," combined with the suffix "-ly," which forms adverbs.  The word evolved through Middle English "chere" (meaning face, countenance, and later, "joy, good humor") and then to the modern "cheer."  The addition of "-fully" emphasizes the completeness or fullness of the cheerfulness.
