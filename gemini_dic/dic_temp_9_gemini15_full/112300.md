词源:
The word "lord-like" is a compound word formed from "lord" and the suffix "-like."  "Lord" originates from Old English *hlāford, meaning "loaf-ward," referring to the person who guarded or distributed bread.  The "-like" suffix indicates resemblance or similarity. Therefore, "lord-like" means resembling or having the qualities of a lord.
