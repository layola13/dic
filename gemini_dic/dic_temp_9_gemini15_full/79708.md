glucogenesis:/ˌɡluːkoʊˈdʒɛnəsɪs/| n. |糖异生|The process of forming glucose (a simple sugar) from non-carbohydrate sources, such as amino acids, glycerol, and lactate.  This process is vital for maintaining blood glucose levels, especially during fasting or starvation.|Example: Gluconeogenesis is crucial for supplying glucose to the brain during prolonged fasting.  糖异生对于在长时间禁食期间向大脑提供葡萄糖至关重要。|近义词：glucose production, neoglucogenesis|反义词：glycolysis|名词
