premortifies:/ˌpriːmɔːrˈtaɪfɪz/| v.| 预先使死亡；提前使无效；提前使腐败 | To cause to die or become ineffective before the expected or natural time.  The word is a relatively rare and somewhat obscure neologism, likely formed by combining "pre-" (before) and "mortify" (to subdue, humiliate, or kill).  It suggests a process of premature death, decay, or nullification.  There is no standard dictionary definition, and its usage is highly context-dependent. |例句：The harsh chemicals premortified the plant tissue, preventing its normal growth.  (严酷的化学物质使植物组织提前死亡，阻止其正常生长。) The sudden announcement premortified the deal, rendering it void. (突然的公告使交易提前失效，使其无效。) |近义词：prematurely kill, annul, invalidate, destroy |反义词：revive, revitalize, prolong, preserve
