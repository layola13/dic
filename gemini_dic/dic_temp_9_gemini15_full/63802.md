词源:
The word "epidemiologist" is derived from the Greek words "epi" (upon, among), "demos" (people), and "logos" (study, discourse).  It literally means "the study of what is upon the people," referring to the study of the distribution and determinants of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to control health problems.
