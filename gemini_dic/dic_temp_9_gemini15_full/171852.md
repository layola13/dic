词源:

The word "punishers" is derived from the verb "punish," which traces back to the Old French word "punir" and ultimately to the Latin word "punire," meaning "to punish" or "to avenge."  The suffix "-ers" indicates the agent or doer of the action.  Therefore, "punishers" literally means "those who punish."
