contractibilities: /ˌkɒntræk.tɪˈbɪl.ɪ.tiːz/ | n. | 收缩性；可收缩性 | The ability of a muscle or other tissue to contract.  This term often refers to the inherent capacity of a substance to shorten or reduce in size, especially in the context of muscle physiology or material science.  | Example: The contractibilities of the heart muscle are crucial for maintaining blood circulation. 心肌的收缩性对于维持血液循环至关重要。 The experiment measured the contractibilities of various polymer samples under different temperatures. 实验测量了不同温度下各种聚合物样品的收缩性。 | 近义词：contractility, contractability | 反义词：rigidity, inflexibility | 名词


USAGE->

疑问句:
What are the typical contractibilities of skeletal muscle? = 骨骼肌的典型收缩性是什么？
How do temperature changes affect the contractibilities? = 温度变化如何影响收缩性？


否定句:
The muscle showed no significant loss of contractibilities. = 肌肉没有显示出明显的收缩性下降。
The drug did not affect the contractibilities of the heart. = 该药物不影响心脏的收缩性。


PHRASE->
reduced contractibilities = 收缩性降低
altered contractibilities = 改变的收缩性
impaired contractibilities = 受损的收缩性
increased contractibilities = 增加的收缩性
normal contractibilities = 正常的收缩性
