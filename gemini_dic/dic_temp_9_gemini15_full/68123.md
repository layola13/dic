词源:

The word's etymology is complex and reflects its evolution from a culinary term to a deeply offensive slur.  The original meaning referred to a bundle of sticks used for fuel, deriving from the Middle English word *fagot*.  Its application to food likely arose from the similar shape and composition of the dish to a bundled faggot of sticks.  The pejorative use as a homophobic slur emerged in the 20th century, possibly from a perceived association of effeminate men with weakness or burning at the stake (a historical punishment).  The exact origins of the slur remain uncertain but its usage is unequivocally offensive and harmful.
