词源:
The word "right" has a long and complex history, tracing back to Proto-Germanic *reχtiz, meaning "straight, correct."  This shares roots with words in other Germanic languages.  Its evolution reflects its multifaceted meanings.  The sense of "correctness" and "justice" developed over time, along with the spatial meaning of "right" (as opposed to "left").
