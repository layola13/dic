The word "dickin" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a regional dialect word, slang, or a proper noun (like a surname).  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible without further context.  To provide the requested information, I need clarification on the intended word or its context.
