The term "mesomorph" originates from the Greek words "mesos" (meaning "middle") and "morphē" (meaning "form" or "shape"). It refers to one of the three somatotypes (body types) proposed by William Sheldon in his influential work on constitutional psychology.  The other two somatotypes are ectomorph (thin and linear) and endomorph (round and soft).
