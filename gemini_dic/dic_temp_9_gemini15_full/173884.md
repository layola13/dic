词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost."  It indicates something that resembles or approximates another thing but is not truly that thing.

* **relieved**: From the past participle of the verb "relieve," meaning to ease or lessen something unpleasant or burdensome.  This in turn comes from Old French *relever*.
