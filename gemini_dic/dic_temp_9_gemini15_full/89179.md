homeostat:/ˈhoʊmioʊstæt/| n. |稳态器；体内平衡系统| A homeostat is a device or system that maintains stability or equilibrium. It works by detecting deviations from a set point and then initiating corrective actions to restore the system to its desired state.  This term is often used in biology to describe the body's ability to maintain internal stability, despite external changes.  |Example: The body's homeostatic mechanisms regulate temperature, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels.  人体自身的稳态机制调节着体温、血压和血糖水平。|近义词：regulator, controller, stabilizer |反义词：disruptor, destabilizer


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The thermostat acts as a homeostat for the room's temperature. = 恒温器充当房间温度的稳态器。
Our bodies maintain homeostasis through various processes. = 我们的身体通过各种过程维持体内平衡。


一般过去时:
The ancient Greek physician Galen described aspects of homeostasis. = 古希腊医生盖伦描述了稳态的某些方面。
The experiment demonstrated the homeostat's ability to regulate pressure. = 实验证明了稳态器调节压力的能力。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied homeostasis for centuries. = 科学家们已经研究了几个世纪的稳态。
Researchers have developed sophisticated homeostatic devices. = 研究人员已经开发出复杂的稳态设备。


过去完成时:
Before the invention of modern technology, maintaining homeostasis was more challenging. = 在现代技术发明之前，维持稳态更具挑战性。
The patient's body had already begun compensating for the injury, demonstrating its homeostatic mechanisms. = 病人的身体已经开始补偿受伤，这证明了它的稳态机制。


将来时:
Future research will likely explore new ways to enhance homeostasis. = 未来的研究可能会探索增强稳态的新方法。
We will need more efficient homeostats in future space exploration. = 在未来的太空探索中，我们将需要更高效的稳态器。


虚拟语气:
If the homeostatic mechanisms failed, the body would be at risk. = 如果稳态机制失效，身体将面临风险。
It would be ideal if we could perfectly replicate the body's homeostatic processes. = 如果我们能够完美地复制人体的稳态过程，那就太好了。


被动语态:
Homeostasis is maintained by complex feedback loops. = 稳态是由复杂的反馈回路维持的。
The temperature was carefully controlled by the homeostat. = 温度由稳态器小心控制。


疑问句:
How does the body maintain homeostasis? = 人体是如何维持稳态的？
What are the components of a simple homeostat? = 一个简单的稳态器由哪些组成部分构成？


否定句:
The system did not maintain homeostasis under stress. = 该系统在压力下没有维持稳态。
The device failed to properly regulate, thus disrupting homeostasis. = 该设备未能正确调节，从而破坏了稳态。


PHRASE->
