/hɑːfˈkrɪtɪkəlˌnɛsɪz/ | n. | 半关键性；半临界性 | The word "half-criticalnesses" is a rare and somewhat unusual formation. It combines "half," indicating a partial or incomplete state, with "criticalness," referring to the state or quality of being critical.  The "-nesses" suffix pluralizes the noun "criticalness," suggesting multiple instances or aspects of being partially critical.  Therefore, it could refer to multiple instances of something being only partly or marginally critical.  The meaning depends heavily on context.  There's no established dictionary definition for this word. Its usage would likely be found in highly specialized or technical fields. |  Example:  The study identified several half-criticalnesses in the system's design, meaning several components were only marginally stable. = 这项研究确定了系统设计中的几个半关键性问题，这意味着几个组件只是勉强稳定。 The report highlighted various half-criticalnesses in the project's timeline, indicating some deadlines were only partially crucial. = 报告强调了项目时间表中的各种半关键性问题，表明有些截止日期只是部分重要。 |  近义词: partial criticalities, borderline critical points | 反义词:  full criticalities, completely non-critical aspects | n.
