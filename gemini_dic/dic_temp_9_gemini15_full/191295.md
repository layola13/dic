scazon:/ˈskeɪzɒn/| n. |跛脚诗; 缺陷诗 |A scazon, also known as a choliambus, is a type of verse in which the final syllable is a spondee (two stressed syllables) rather than the expected iamb (unstressed, stressed) in an iambic pentameter line.  This final spondee creates a limping or halting effect.  It is often used for comedic or satirical effect. | Example:  "The world is round, they say, and I agree,  But what's the point, if I can't see the sea?" (This is a simplified example, a true scazon requires a more precise metrical structure)  | 近义词：Choliambus (synonym)|反义词：None (It describes a specific metrical form, not a concept with direct opposites)|
