nonexpansions:/ˌnɒnɪkˈspænʃənz/ | n. |非扩张 |The absence of expansion or growth; a state or instance of not expanding.  It often refers to mathematical concepts, particularly in fixed-point theory and optimization. | Example:  The algorithm guarantees nonexpansions of the search space.  该算法保证搜索空间不会膨胀。| 近义词：contractions, reductions | 反义词：expansions, growths | 名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a technical context, particularly in mathematics.  Therefore, providing grammatical examples in the typical tenses wouldn't be illustrative. Instead, I will offer examples showing its use in different mathematical contexts.

Example 1 (Set Theory):
The mapping demonstrates nonexpansions of sets A and B.  映射证明了集合A和B的非扩张性。


Example 2 (Fixed-Point Theory):
The iterative process involves nonexpansive mappings to find a fixed point.  迭代过程涉及非扩张映射以找到不动点。


Example 3 (Optimization):
The algorithm ensures nonexpansions of the feasible region during optimization.  该算法确保在优化过程中可行区域不会膨胀。


Example 4 (Metric Space):
The function is nonexpansive in the given metric space.  在给定的度量空间中，该函数是非扩张的。


Example 5 (Functional Analysis):
The study of nonexpansive mappings is a significant area within functional analysis.  非扩张映射的研究是泛函分析中的一个重要领域。



PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "nonexpansions".  The term is highly specialized.  Phrases related to the concept might include:


"Lack of expansion"  = 缺乏扩张
"Absence of growth" = 缺乏增长
"Contraction mapping" = 收缩映射 (a related mathematical concept)
"Stable iterations" = 稳定的迭代 (a consequence of nonexpansive behavior)
"Bounded iterations" = 有界迭代 (another consequence)
