/ˈreɪdiəbl/ | adj. | 可辐射的；可播散的 | Capable of being radiated or emitted as radiation.  This word refers to something that can emit or transmit radiation, either electromagnetic radiation (like light or radio waves) or other forms of radiant energy (like heat).  | 例句：The material is radiable, making it suitable for use in shielding against radiation.  该材料具有辐射性，使其适合用于防辐射屏蔽。

The newly developed compound is radiable at specific frequencies. 新研发的化合物可在特定频率下辐射。


近义词：transmittable, emissible | 反义词：non-radiable


词源:  Derived from "radiate" + "-able,"  meaning capable of being radiated.  "Radiate" itself comes from the Latin word "radiātus," the past participle of "radiāre," meaning "to shine," "to beam," or "to spread out like rays."
