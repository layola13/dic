词性：名词


词源:

* **self-**:  Prefix meaning "of or relating to oneself."  This is a native English element.

* **indignation**: This comes from the Latin word "indignatio," meaning "unworthiness," "disdain," or "anger at something unjust."  It's built from:

    * **in-**:  A negative prefix (like "un-").
    * **dignatio**:  From "dignitas," meaning "worth," "dignity," or "rank."

Therefore, "indignation" literally means "unworthiness" or "a feeling of anger and annoyance provoked by what is perceived as unfair treatment."
