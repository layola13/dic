词源:  The word "rummest" is a superlative form of an informal and possibly dialectal word "rum," meaning strange, odd, or chaotic.  Its precise etymology is unclear, but it might be related to other informal words suggesting disorder or confusion.  The superlative "-est" ending emphasizes the extreme nature of the "rum" quality.
