词源:  The word "predilection" comes from the Latin prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance"), "diligere" (meaning "to love" or "to choose"), and the suffix "-tion" (forming nouns of action or state).  Therefore, its literal meaning is something chosen or loved beforehand, implying a strong and established preference.


用法说明:

Predilection is primarily used as a noun. It's often used to describe a somewhat ingrained preference or inclination, something more than a simple liking.  It suggests a predisposition or tendency towards something, often implying a strong or even ingrained preference.  The object of a predilection can be a thing, an activity, a type of person, etc.
