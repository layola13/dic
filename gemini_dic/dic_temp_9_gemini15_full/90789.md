词源:

The word "humouring" comes from the Old French word "humer," meaning "to be in a good mood, to please, to satisfy."  This is ultimately derived from the Latin word "humor," referring to bodily fluids (believed to affect temperament in medieval times).  The meaning evolved to encompass the idea of accommodating someone's mood or temperament.
