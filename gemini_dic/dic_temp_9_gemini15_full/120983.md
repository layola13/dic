miscibilities:/ˌmɪsɪˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 可混溶性，互溶性 | The ability of two or more substances to mix together to form a homogeneous mixture.  This property is dependent on the intermolecular forces between the substances.  High miscibility indicates strong attraction between the molecules of different substances, while low miscibility suggests weaker interactions.  The degree of miscibility can be complete (fully miscible), partial (partially miscible), or immiscible (completely insoluble). | Example: The miscibilities of oil and water are very low, meaning they don't mix easily.  油和水的可混溶性很低，这意味着它们不容易混合。


Example:  The high miscibilities of ethanol and water allow for the creation of various alcoholic beverages. 乙醇和水的可混溶性很高，可以用来制造各种酒精饮料。
