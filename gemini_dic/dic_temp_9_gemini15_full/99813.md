词源:

* **inter-**:  prefix meaning "between," "among," or "mutually."
* **min-**:  from Latin "minus," meaning "less" or "small."  In this context, it implies a lack of limits or boundaries.
* **-able**: suffix forming adjectives meaning "capable of," "worthy of," or "suitable for."
* **-ity**: suffix forming nouns denoting a quality, state, or condition.

Therefore, "interminability" literally suggests a state of being without a lessening or end, a state of endlessness.
