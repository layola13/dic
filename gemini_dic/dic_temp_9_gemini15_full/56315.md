词源:  The word "dogie" is of uncertain origin, but is thought to be derived from a Spanish word, possibly "dog," referring to a stray or abandoned animal.  Another theory links it to the French word  "dogue," meaning "mastiff," referencing the animal's potentially strong and independent nature. Its specific usage is heavily tied to the American West and cowboy culture.
