词源:
The etymology of "floogy" is uncertain.  It's likely slang originating in the mid-20th century, possibly as a descriptive term for overly flamboyant or dated styles, particularly in clothing.  There's no established connection to any other known word.  Its usage suggests a blend of "flowy" (suggesting movement and perhaps excess) and a sound that evokes a sense of gaudiness or showiness.
