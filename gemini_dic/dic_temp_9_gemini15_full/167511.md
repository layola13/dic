The word "previolates" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  If it's intended as a word, it would probably be formed from "pre-" and "violates," suggesting an action of violating *before* something else.  However, without context, a proper analysis is impossible.  To provide a detailed analysis as requested, a valid English word is needed.
