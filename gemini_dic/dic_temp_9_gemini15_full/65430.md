词源:

The word "euphuism" derives from the Greek word "euphemism" (εὐφημισμός), meaning "the use of pleasant or inoffensive words," and ultimately from "eu" (well, good) and "pheme" (speech, reputation). However, the modern meaning of "euphuism" is a significant departure from this original sense.  It specifically refers to the ornate and artificial style of writing popularized by John Lyly in his 16th-century prose works, *Euphues* (1578) and *Euphues and his England* (1580).  Lyly's work, though initially admired for its elegance, came to be associated with excessive artificiality and became the archetype for what we now term "euphuism."
