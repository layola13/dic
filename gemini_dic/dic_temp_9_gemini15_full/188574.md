The word "ruka" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is not possible.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Please double-check the spelling.
* **A proper noun:** Perhaps a name, place, or brand.  More context is needed.
* **A word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language. If you can provide the language of origin, I can try to provide a translation and explanation.
* **Neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word or slang term not yet included in standard dictionaries.


To help me assist you, please provide more information such as:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (book, website, conversation, etc.)
* **What was the context?** (the sentence or paragraph it was used in)
* **What language do you suspect it might be from?**


Once I have this additional information, I can provide a more accurate and helpful response.
