词源:
The word "control" comes from the Old French word "controller," which ultimately derives from the Medieval Latin word "contrarotulator," meaning "counter-controller."  The original meaning refers to a person who checks accounts or verifies records, implying a supervisory or regulating function.  This evolved into the broader sense of managing or directing something.
