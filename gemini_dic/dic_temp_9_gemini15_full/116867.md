The word "maxs" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, abbreviation, or a word used within a very specific context (e.g., slang, jargon, a proper noun).  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, clarification is needed on the intended word or its context.
