isomerism:/aɪˈsɒmərɪzəm/ | n. |异构现象，同分异构现象 |The existence of isomers.  Isomerism is a phenomenon where two or more compounds have the same molecular formula but different structural formulas.  This difference in structure leads to different physical and chemical properties. For example, glucose and fructose both have the formula C6H12O6, but they have different structures and different properties. |Glucose and fructose are examples of isomers. |近义词：isomerization (process), stereoisomerism (specific type)|反义词：无
