The word "monton" is not a standard English word. There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you intended another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* **It's a proper noun:** It might be a place name, a person's name, or a brand name not widely known.
* **It's a word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into standard English.


If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, what it refers to), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
