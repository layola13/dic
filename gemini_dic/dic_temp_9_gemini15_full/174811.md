racemation:/ˌreɪsɪˈmeɪʃən/ | n. | 外消旋化；消旋混合物 | The process by which a mixture of equal amounts of enantiomers (optical isomers) is formed, resulting in a loss of optical activity.  This occurs when a chiral molecule loses its chirality, typically through a chemical reaction or by the spontaneous interconversion of enantiomers.  | Example: The racemation of tartaric acid can be achieved by heating it in the presence of a base. 外消旋酒石酸的制备可以通过在碱的存在下加热来实现。|近义词：enantiomerization, optical inactivation |反义词：resolution (separation of enantiomers)
