Etymology:

The word "Slav" derives from the Proto-Slavic word *slověninъ*, meaning "one who speaks," or, more literally, "one who understands." This reflects the self-identification of the Slavic peoples based on their shared language.  Over time, this evolved through various linguistic changes to the modern word "Slav."  The term's later association with the word "slave" is purely coincidental and etymologically unrelated, though this has significantly impacted its modern connotations.
