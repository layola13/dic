词源:
The word "periodically" is derived from the word "period," which comes from the late Middle English word "periode," ultimately from the Late Latin word "periodos," meaning "a going round, circuit, revolution," from the Greek word "περίοδος" (periodos), meaning "a going around, circuit, revolution."  The suffix "-ically" is an adverbial suffix indicating "in a manner of," or "in accordance with".  Therefore, "periodically" literally means "in a manner of periods" or "at regular intervals".
