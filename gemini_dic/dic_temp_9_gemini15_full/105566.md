词源:  The word "kinaesthetic" is derived from the Greek words "kinein" (to move) and "aisthesis" (perception, sensation).  It is a blend of "kinetic" (relating to motion) and "aesthetic" (relating to perception or sensation).  The "k" in "kinaesthetic" is retained from the Greek origin, while the spelling variation "kinesthetic" is also common, particularly in American English.
