词源:

The word "idolizing" is derived from the noun "idol" and the suffix "-izing," which indicates the process of making something into an idol or the act of treating something as an idol.  "Idol" itself traces back to the Greek word "eidōlon," meaning "image, phantom, likeness." This reflects the original religious context of idols as representations of deities. Over time, the meaning broadened to include any object or person that receives excessive admiration or devotion.
