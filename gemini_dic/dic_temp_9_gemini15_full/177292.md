reassisting: /ˌriːəˈsɪstɪŋ/ | v. | 再次抵抗，重新抵抗 |  The word "reassisting" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  It seems to combine "re-" (again) and "resisting" (opposing). Therefore, its meaning can be inferred as "resisting again" or "opposing anew". | 例句：The army, after a brief respite, found itself reassisting the enemy's advance. (军队在短暂休整后，发现自己再次抵抗敌人的进攻。) | 近义词: resisting again, opposing anew, counterattacking | 反义词: surrendering, yielding, complying |  词性:动词
