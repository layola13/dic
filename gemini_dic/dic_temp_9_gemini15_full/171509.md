词源:From Anglo-Norman French *puisné, past participle of puiser "to be born later," from Vulgar Latin *postnatus, from Latin post "after" + natus "born."  The original meaning referred to a younger son in a family, and this extended to a meaning of lower rank or junior status.


用法说明:

Puisne is primarily used in legal contexts, particularly to describe judges of lower rank than the chief justice or other senior judges.  It is less common in everyday speech.  While it can technically describe anything of lower rank, its usage is heavily restricted to the legal profession and related fields.  The word carries a sense of respect despite indicating a junior position.
