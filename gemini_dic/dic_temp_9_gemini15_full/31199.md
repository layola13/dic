The word "changhai" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a transliteration of a name or place from another language, most probably Chinese.  Therefore, a traditional lexical analysis as requested isn't possible.  To provide a helpful response, I need more context.  Is "changhai" a person's name, a place name, or something else?  Knowing its origin would allow me to provide a more accurate explanation.
