rhyolite:/ˈraɪəlaɪt/| n. |流纹岩|Rhyolite is an extrusive igneous rock, meaning it's formed from magma that erupted onto the Earth's surface and cooled quickly.  It's typically light-colored and rich in silica.  It often exhibits a fine-grained texture, though sometimes larger crystals (phenocrysts) are visible within the finer-grained matrix.  The silica content influences its viscosity, making it relatively viscous compared to other volcanic rocks.  This high viscosity often leads to the formation of glassy textures or flow banding in rhyolite flows.|Example: The geologist identified the sample as rhyolite due to its characteristic glassy texture and high silica content. = 地质学家根据其特征的玻璃质地和高二氧化硅含量，将样品鉴定为流纹岩。|近义词：obsidian, dacite,  felsite|反义词：basalt
