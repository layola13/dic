molestful:/məˈlestfʊl/| adj. | 令人讨厌的；令人作呕的；猥亵的 |  The word "molestful" is not a standard English word. While it *appears* to be formed from "molest" + "-ful,"  it's not found in reputable dictionaries and isn't used in common English parlance.  Its intended meaning would likely be similar to "offensive," "disgusting," or "lewd," but using "molestful" would be considered incorrect and unconventional. It would be better to use established synonyms. | The sentence structure using "molestful" would be grammatically correct but semantically odd.  For example: "The image was molestful" is grammatically sound but should be replaced with "The image was offensive" or "The image was disgusting." | offensive, disgusting, lewd, obscene | pleasant, delightful, acceptable | adjective
