* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps a misspelling of "showing," "shedding," or another word entirely? Please double-check your spelling.
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word, a word specific to a certain dialect, or slang used within a particular community.  More context is needed to understand its meaning.
* **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or place name.
