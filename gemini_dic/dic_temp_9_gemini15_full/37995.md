词源：

From the Old French word *complicité*, derived from the Latin *complicitus*, meaning "entangled," "involved," or "folded together."  The Latin word is formed from *com-* (together) + *plicāre* (to fold).  The sense evolved from a general idea of being entangled or interwoven to a more specific legal meaning of shared guilt or responsibility in a crime.
