Etymology:

The word "careworn" is a compound word formed from "care" and "worn."  "Care" here refers to worry or anxiety,  and "worn" indicates the effect of this worry – a state of being visibly affected or depleted by it.  The suffix "-worn" is a common past participle used to describe something that has been affected or changed by a particular action or process.  Its roots trace back to Old English "weorþan," meaning "to become," and reflects a process of gradual wearing down.
