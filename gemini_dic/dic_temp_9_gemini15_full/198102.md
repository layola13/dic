The word "shoop" doesn't exist as a standard English word with a formal definition in dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's likely:

1. **A misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Without context, it's hard to say which.

2. **Slang or informal term:** It could be slang, jargon, or a newly coined word within a specific community or context.  Its meaning would depend entirely on where and how it's used.

3. **Onomatopoeia:**  It might be an onomatopoeic word, imitating a sound.  For example, it could represent a quick, sharp sound.

4. **A proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (name of a person, place, or thing), but without more information, this is unlikely.

To provide a proper analysis, please provide the sentence or context in which "shoop" is used.  Only then can we attempt to determine its meaning and provide a response similar to the example you provided for "what."
