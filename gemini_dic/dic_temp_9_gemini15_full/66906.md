词源:
The word "expedition" comes from the Old French word "expedition," which in turn derives from the Latin word "expeditio," meaning "a setting out, a journey."  The Latin word is formed from the verb "expedire," meaning "to extricate, to disentangle," which further implies the idea of setting out on a journey to achieve a specific purpose, free from obstacles.
