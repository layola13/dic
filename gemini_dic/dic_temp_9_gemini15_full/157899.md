词源:  From Old French *plaisance, from plaisir "pleasure," from Latin placere "to please."  The word reflects a shift in meaning over time, moving from a more general sense of pleasure to a more specific sense of refined or elegant pleasure, sometimes with connotations of self-indulgence or ostentation.
