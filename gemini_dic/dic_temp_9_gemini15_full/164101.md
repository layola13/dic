The word "predislikes" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  If you meant a different word, please provide the correct spelling.

If "predislikes" was intended as a combination of "pre-" and "dislikes," it would imply a prior or existing dislike, or a predisposition to dislike something. However, this is not a standard word.  To express this idea, one would use phrases like "has a predisposition to dislike," "already dislikes," or "prefers not to like."
