词源:
The word "debriefing" is a relatively modern term. It's a combination of the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse") and the noun "briefing," which means "a short summary or explanation."  The term likely originated in the military or aviation contexts, where it was crucial to gather information after a mission to learn from experience.
