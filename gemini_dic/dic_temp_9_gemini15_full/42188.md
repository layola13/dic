coulomb:/ˈkuːlɒm/| n. |库仑|The coulomb (symbol: C) is the International System of Units (SI) unit of electric charge.  It is the charge transported by a constant current of one ampere in one second.  One coulomb is equal to approximately 6.24 x 10^18 elementary charges, such as electrons or protons.  The coulomb is named after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, a French physicist.|例句：The electric charge on the capacitor is measured in coulombs. 电容器上的电荷以库仑为单位测量。

The current flowing through the wire is one ampere, meaning one coulomb of charge passes a given point each second. 通过导线的电流为一安培，这意味着每秒钟有一库仑的电荷通过给定点。|近义词:unit of electric charge|反义词:None|名词
