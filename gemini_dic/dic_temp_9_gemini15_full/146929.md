/ˌoʊvərɪnˈtɛnsnəsɪz/ | n. |过度紧张的状态(复数) |  The word "overintensenesses" is a plural form of "overintenseness," which itself is not a commonly used word. It describes instances or states of excessive intensity, often referring to feelings, actions, or efforts.  It suggests a level of intensity that is beyond what is necessary or healthy.  The word is formed by adding the suffix "-ness" (indicating a state or condition) to "overintense," which combines "over" (meaning excessively) and "intense" (meaning of extreme force, degree, or strength).  Because of its rarity, finding common usage examples is difficult.  A hypothetical example could be:  "His overintensenesses in the debate led to several heated arguments." |  近义词: excesses, overzealousnesses, hyperintensities | 反义词: calmnesses, placidities, understatements |  名词


例句：

His overintensenesses in training led to burnout. = 他训练过度紧张，导致筋疲力尽。

The team's overintensenesses ultimately hindered their performance. = 球队的过度紧张最终阻碍了他们的表现。


USAGE->
(Since "overintensenesses" is a rare and unusual word,  providing grammatical examples across tenses and moods would be artificial and unproductive.  The usage would follow standard plural noun rules.)


PHRASE->
(Due to the unusual nature of "overintensenesses,"  common phrases are not readily available. The word itself would likely be used in a sentence rather than a common phrase.)
