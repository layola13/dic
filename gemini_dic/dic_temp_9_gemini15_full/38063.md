词源:
The word "composited" comes from the verb "composite," which in turn derives from the Latin word "compositus," meaning "put together," "composed," or "made up."  The prefix "com-" means "together," and "positus" is the past participle of "ponere," meaning "to place" or "to put."  Therefore, the word's etymology clearly indicates its meaning of combining different elements into a single whole.
