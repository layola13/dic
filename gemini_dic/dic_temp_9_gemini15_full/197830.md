词源:
The term "shinplaster" likely originated in the United States during the 19th century.  The exact etymology is uncertain, but the most widely accepted theory links it to the practice of pasting (or plastering) these makeshift banknotes onto a piece of shin leather to protect them from wear and tear.  The “shin” likely refers to the shinbone, suggesting a relatively cheap and readily available material.  The term’s association with worthless paper money reflects the dubious quality of these often privately issued notes.
