词源:

The word "hypnotized" is derived from "hypnosis," which in turn comes from the Greek word "hypnos," meaning "sleep."  The suffix "-ized" indicates the process of being subjected to or affected by something.  Therefore, "hypnotized" signifies being put into a state resembling sleep, typically through suggestion.
