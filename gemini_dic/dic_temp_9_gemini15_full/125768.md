词源:

The word "murderously" is derived from the noun "murder" and the suffix "-ously," which signifies "in a manner of" or "to a great extent."  "Murder" itself has roots in Old French *murdrer ("to murder, kill, assassinate") and ultimately from the Proto-Germanic *morþrōn ("to murder").  Therefore, "murderously" literally describes something done in a manner characteristic of murder – with extreme violence or intensity.
