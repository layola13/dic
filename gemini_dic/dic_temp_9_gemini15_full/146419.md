词源:

The word "overfoolish" is a compound word. It combines the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much") with the adjective "foolish" (meaning "lacking good sense or judgment").  Therefore, its meaning is a direct consequence of the combination of these two elements.  There's no separate etymological history for "overfoolish" beyond the combination of its constituent parts, whose roots trace back to Old English ("over" and "foolish").
