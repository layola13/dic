The word "dutchs" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a very obscure term.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis as requested.  To help, I need more context: where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the context might help determine the intended word and its meaning.
