词源:
The word "good-naturedness" is a combination of "good-natured" and the suffix "-ness".  "Good-natured" itself derives from "good" (meaning kind, benevolent) and "natured" (referring to inherent character or disposition). The suffix "-ness" forms nouns of quality or state.  Therefore, good-naturedness essentially means the state or quality of being good-natured.
