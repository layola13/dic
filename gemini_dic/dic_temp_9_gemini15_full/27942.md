词源:  The word "cantle" comes from the Old French "cantel," meaning "corner," "piece," or "fragment."  This ultimately derives from the Vulgar Latin *cantellus, a diminutive of *canthus, meaning "corner" or "edge."  The application to the back part of a saddle likely arose from its position as a distinct corner or raised piece on the saddle.
