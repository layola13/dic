词源:
The word "gigantic" ultimately derives from the Greek word "gigas" (γίγας), meaning "giant."  The suffix "-ic" is a common adjectival suffix in English, indicating "relating to" or "characterized by."  Therefore, "gigantic" literally means "relating to or characteristic of a giant."  It entered English through Latin and eventually evolved to its current form.
