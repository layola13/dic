radio-resistance: /ˈreɪdioʊrɪzɪstəns/ | n. | 放射抗性，抗辐射性 | The ability of a cell, organism, or material to withstand the damaging effects of ionizing radiation.  This resistance can be inherent or acquired through various mechanisms.  | Example:  The radio-resistance of certain bacteria makes them difficult to eliminate with radiation therapy.  =某些细菌的抗辐射性使其难以通过放射疗法消除。

The study of radio-resistance is crucial in cancer treatment, where understanding how cancer cells develop this property allows for the development of more effective therapies. = 抗辐射性的研究对于癌症治疗至关重要，因为了解癌细胞如何发展这种特性有助于开发更有效的疗法。| 近义词：radiation resistance, radiotolerance | 反义词：radiosensitivity
