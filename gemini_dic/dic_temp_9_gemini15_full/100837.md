introgression:/ˌɪntrəˈɡreʃən/| n. |基因渐渗；基因渗入|The transfer of genetic material from one species to another by repeated backcrossing.  This process often occurs in plants and can lead to the introduction of new traits into a population. |Example: Introgression of genes from wild relatives into cultivated crops is a common phenomenon. 基因渐渗是从野生近缘种到栽培作物中基因转移的常见现象。|近义词：gene flow, hybridization |反义词：genetic isolation
