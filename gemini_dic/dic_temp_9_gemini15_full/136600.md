The word "nonsaner" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown is impossible.  To provide a response in the requested format would be inaccurate and misleading.

If you intended a different word, please provide the correct spelling.  If "nonsaner" is indeed a newly coined word within a specific context (e.g., fiction, technical jargon), please provide that context so I can attempt an analysis based on its usage in that specific environment.
