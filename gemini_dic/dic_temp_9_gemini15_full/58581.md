词源:
The word "dulcimer" ultimately derives from the Old French *doucemele, which itself comes from the Latin *dulcimeli.  The Latin word combines *dulcis ("sweet") and *meli ("honey"), suggesting the instrument's sweet sound.  The word's evolution reflects its long history and the appreciation for its melodic qualities across different cultures.
