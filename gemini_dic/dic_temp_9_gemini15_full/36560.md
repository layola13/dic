词源:
The word "collapse" comes from the Late Latin word "collapsus," the past participle of "collapsare," meaning "to fall together."  "Collapsare" itself is a combination of the prefix "col-" (together) and "lapsus" (fallen, a past participle of "labi," meaning "to slip or slide").  Therefore, the word's origin reflects the idea of something falling or coming together suddenly.
