hydrogenation:/ˌhaɪˈdrɒdʒəneɪʃən/ | n. | 氢化；加氢 | The process of adding hydrogen to a substance, typically an unsaturated organic compound, resulting in a saturated compound. This process often involves a catalyst.  | Example: The hydrogenation of vegetable oils converts them into solid or semi-solid fats.  氢化植物油将其转化为固态或半固态脂肪。 |近义词：reduction (in this context) | 反义词：dehydrogenation


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Hydrogenation is used in many industrial processes. = 氢化被用于许多工业过程中。
