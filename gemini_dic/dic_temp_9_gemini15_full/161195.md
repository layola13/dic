USAGE->
This word is relatively uncommon and doesn't lend itself to typical grammatical tense examples in the same way as common verbs like "to be" or "to do."  The usage is primarily limited to describing the action of adding postils.  Therefore, tense examples are not applicable in the same manner as the example word "what".

PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "postillator." The word itself is used to describe a person, not to form common expressions.
