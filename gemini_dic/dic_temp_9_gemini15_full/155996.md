photoinductive: /ˌfoʊtoʊɪnˈdʌktɪv/ | adj. | 光致诱导的 |  Relating to or caused by the induction of a process or effect by light.  This term often describes processes where light triggers a reaction or change in a material or system.  The effect is typically not a direct result of the light's energy but rather an indirect consequence of the light's interaction with the system.


例句：

The photoinductive effect in the semiconductor material led to an increase in conductivity. = 半导体材料中的光致诱导效应导致电导率增加。

Photoinductive processes are important in photosynthesis, where light initiates a cascade of chemical reactions. = 光致诱导过程在光合作用中很重要，光启动了一系列化学反应。
