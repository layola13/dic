词源：

The word is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "reservable," which is derived from the verb "reserve" (meaning "to keep or set aside for future use").  "Reserve" itself originates from the Old French word "reserver" and ultimately from the Latin "reservare" (to keep back, save).
