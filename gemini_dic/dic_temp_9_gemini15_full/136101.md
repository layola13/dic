/ˌnɒnˌrɛkjʊpərətɪvənəsɪz/ | n. | 不可恢复性；无法复原性 | The word "nonrecuperativenesses" is extremely rare and not found in standard dictionaries.  It's a complex, artificially constructed word formed by combining several elements: "non-" (not), "recuperat" (to recover), "-ive" (having the nature of), and "-ness" (state or quality), then adding a plural "-es".  It describes the multiple states or qualities of being unrecoverable or irretrievable. The word is essentially a highly unusual and cumbersome way of expressing the concept of things that cannot be recovered or restored. There are far simpler and more common ways to convey this meaning. | The multiple instances of environmental damage demonstrated the devastating nonrecuperativenesses of the oil spill.  |  irreversibility, irretrievability, irrecoverability | recoverability, reparability | 名词
