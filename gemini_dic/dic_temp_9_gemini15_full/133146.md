The provided word "{nonethereality}" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a neologism or a made-up word, possibly combining elements to suggest a lack of reality or a denial of reality.  Therefore, a traditional lexical analysis is not possible.  I cannot provide pronunciation, grammatical function, definition, examples, synonyms, antonyms, or usage examples in the requested format.  To analyze a word, it must exist within a recognized lexicon.
