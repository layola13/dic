词源:
The term is a compound of "piss," a vulgar term for urine, and "poor," meaning of low quality. The combination intensifies the meaning of "poor," creating a highly informal and emphatic expression of extreme negativity.  The exact origin is difficult to pinpoint, but its use reflects the intensification of meaning through the combination of a vulgar word with a common adjective.
