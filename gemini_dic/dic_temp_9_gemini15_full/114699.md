malkin:/ˈmɔːlkɪn/| n.|女巫；肮脏的女人；吓人的女人；抹布|A malkin is a derogatory term for a woman, often implying she is dirty, unkempt, or generally unpleasant.  The term's origins are rooted in its association with domestic cleaning implements.  Historically, a "malkin" could refer to a mop or a rag, leading to its figurative use as a pejorative for a woman. |例句：She called the gossiping neighbor a malkin. = 她称那个爱说闲话的邻居为肮脏的女人。

The old woman, withered and ragged, was scornfully called a malkin by the villagers. = 村民们轻蔑地称那个又老又破的妇人为肮脏的女人。


近义词：hag, shrew, trollop, slattern|反义词：lady, gentlewoman


词源:The word "malkin" ultimately derives from the Old English word "magge," meaning "Margaret."  Over time, the name became associated with domestic servants and, subsequently, with the derogatory connotation it carries today.  Its association with cleaning implements like mops further solidified its pejorative meaning.  The shift in meaning likely occurred due to the association of domestic work with dirt and low social status.
