词源：

The word "excellent" comes from the Late Latin word *excel·lent-, the present participle of *excel·lēre, meaning "to surpass, excel."  This in turn derives from the Latin prefix *ex- ("out, from") and *cel·lēre ("to rise, be high").  Therefore, "excellent" literally means "surpassing, rising above."
