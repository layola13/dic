词源:

The term "off-the-shelf" originates from the retail context.  It literally refers to items that are available on the shelves of a store, ready for immediate purchase, as opposed to items that need to be specially ordered or manufactured.  The "off" signifies the action of taking something from a shelf and the "shelf" denotes the location where readily available goods are kept.
