词源：

The word "nonpropitiable" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "propitiable," which derives from the verb "propitiate."  "Propitiate" comes from the Late Latin *propitiāre, meaning "to appease, conciliate, win over." This in turn originates from the Latin "propitius," meaning "favorable, gracious, kind."


用法说明:

Nonpropitiable is primarily used to describe situations, people, or entities that are impossible to appease, placate, or reconcile. It suggests a state of unyielding anger, resentment, or hostility that cannot be overcome by any means of conciliation.  It carries a stronger sense of unyielding opposition than simply "unappeasable."
