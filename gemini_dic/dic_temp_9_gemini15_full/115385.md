词源:
The word "mansion" comes from the Old French word "mansion," which in turn derives from the Latin word "mansio," meaning "dwelling," "stay," or "residence."  The Latin word is related to the verb "manere," meaning "to remain" or "to stay."  Over time, the meaning evolved to specifically refer to a large and impressive dwelling, often associated with wealth and status.
