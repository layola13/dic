metanephridium:/ˌmɛtənɪˈfrɪdiəm/| n. |後腎；排泄器官| An excretory organ found in many invertebrates, such as annelids and mollusks.  It consists of a ciliated funnel that collects waste products from the coelom and a tubule that carries the waste to the outside of the body. | Example: The metanephridia of earthworms are responsible for filtering waste from their body fluids. = 蚯蚓的後腎負責過濾體液中的廢物。 The metanephridium is a key component of the invertebrate excretory system. = 後腎是無脊椎動物排泄系統的重要組成部分。|近义词：nephridium|反义词： N/A
