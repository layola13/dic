词源:From Middle English *deferente, from Old French *deferent, from Latin deferens, present participle of deferre "to carry away, bear away, defer," from de- "away" + ferre "to carry."  The original meaning referred to the anatomical structure that carried something away. The modern sense evolved from this, referring to a carrying away of one's own will or opinion in deference to another.
