ooesporangium: /ˌoʊ.əˈspɔː.ræn.dʒi.əm/ | n. | 卵孢子囊 | A structure in certain fungi and algae that produces oospores (thick-walled sexual spores).  It is typically the product of sexual reproduction, resulting from the fusion of a male and female gamete. | The oosporangium of *Phytophthora infestans* is responsible for the survival of the pathogen over winter.  *Phytophthora infestans*的卵孢子囊负责病原体越冬的存活。|  近义词：oospore-producing structure | 反义词： (no direct antonym)


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in mycology (the study of fungi) and phycology (the study of algae), so tense usage reflects typical scientific writing.  There is no common use in everyday speech.

一般现在时:
The oosporangium develops after fertilization. = 受精后卵孢子囊发育。
Oosporangia are important for disease survival. = 卵孢子囊对疾病的存活很重要。

一般过去时:
The researchers observed the mature oosporangium. = 研究人员观察了成熟的卵孢子囊。
We examined the oosporangia under a microscope. = 我们在显微镜下检查了卵孢子囊。

现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several types of oosporangia. = 科学家已经鉴定出几种类型的卵孢子囊。
The pathogen has produced numerous oosporangia. = 病原体已经产生了大量的卵孢子囊。

过去完成时:
The oosporangium had already germinated before the analysis. = 在分析之前，卵孢子囊已经发芽了。
They had observed the development of the oosporangia in previous studies. = 他们在之前的研究中观察到卵孢子囊的发育。

将来时:
The oosporangium will likely release spores in the spring. = 卵孢子囊很可能在春季释放孢子。
We will investigate the genetic makeup of the oosporangia. = 我们将研究卵孢子囊的基因构成。

虚拟语气:
If the oosporangium were viable, it would germinate. = 如果卵孢子囊是可行的，它就会发芽。
It is important that the oosporangium be properly identified. = 正确识别卵孢子囊很重要。

被动语态:
The oosporangium was examined using electron microscopy. = 卵孢子囊用电子显微镜检查。
The oosporangia are often found in soil. = 卵孢子囊通常存在于土壤中。


疑问句:
What is the function of this oosporangium? = 这个卵孢子囊的功能是什么？
How many oosporangia were observed? = 观察到多少卵孢子囊？


否定句:
The sample did not contain any mature oosporangia. = 样本中不包含任何成熟的卵孢子囊。
The oosporangium was not viable. = 卵孢子囊不可行。


PHRASE->
