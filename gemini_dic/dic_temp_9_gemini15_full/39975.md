consubstantiation:/ˌkɒnsʌbˌstænʃɪˈeɪʃən/ | n. | 共质说；同时存在 | The theological doctrine that the substance of the bread and wine in the Eucharist remains the same, but Christ's body and blood are present in, with, and under them.

词源:

The word "consubstantiation" is a modern Latinate term, combining the prefix "con-" (meaning "together" or "with"), "substantia" (meaning "substance"), and the suffix "-ation" (indicating an action or process).  It was coined to describe Luther's theological position on the Eucharist, contrasting it with the Catholic doctrine of transubstantiation.
