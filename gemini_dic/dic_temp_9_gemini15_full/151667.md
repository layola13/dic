词源：

The word derives from "partisan," meaning a strong supporter of a party, cause, or person.  The suffix "-ries" indicates a plural or collective form, suggesting multiple instances of partisan activity or conflict.  Ultimately, it traces back to the French word "partisan," which itself has roots in the Latin "pars," meaning "part."  The sense of division and factionalism inherent in the word is thus deeply rooted in its etymological origins.
