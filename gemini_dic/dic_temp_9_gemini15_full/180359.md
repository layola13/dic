词源:
The word "refurbish" comes from the Old French word "refourbir," which is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and "fourbir" (meaning "to burnish" or "to polish").  Therefore, the original meaning implied a polishing or brightening, often of metal. Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass the more general renovation and restoration we understand today.
