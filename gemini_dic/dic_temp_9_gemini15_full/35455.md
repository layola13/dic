coacervate:/koʊˈsɜːrvət/| n. |凝聚体，团聚体 |A coacervate is a droplet of complex organic molecules, often proteins or nucleic acids, surrounded by a layer of water molecules.  These droplets are considered by some scientists to be a possible precursor to the first living cells. They form spontaneously through a process called coacervation, where molecules aggregate due to hydrophobic interactions and other forces. |Example:  The researchers observed the formation of coacervates in their experiment, simulating early Earth conditions.  研究人员在他们的实验中观察到凝聚体的形成，模拟了早期地球的条件。|近义词：aggregate, droplet |反义词：dispersion, solution |名词
