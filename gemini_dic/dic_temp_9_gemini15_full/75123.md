词源:  The word "friskal" is likely an alteration of the word "frisk," which itself has a complex etymology.  "Frisk" ultimately derives from Middle Dutch *frisken, meaning "to leap, jump, dance."  This in turn relates to Old High German *frisc "fresh, lively," suggesting a connection between the physical act and a feeling of vitality.  The "-al" suffix adds a somewhat archaic or dialectal flavour, suggesting a playful or lively action.
