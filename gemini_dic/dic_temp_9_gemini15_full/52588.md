digammate:/ˈdaɪɡæmeɪt/| n.|双元音|A digammate is a hypothetical consonant sound in Proto-Indo-European, reconstructed from the effects it seems to have had on surrounding sounds.  It's not a sound that is directly attested in any known language, but its existence is inferred from patterns in the daughter languages.  The exact phonetic value of the digammate is debated, with suggestions ranging from a voiced labiovelar approximant [w] to a voiced labiovelar fricative [βʷ].|The presence of a digammate is often indicated in reconstructed Proto-Indo-European words by a star (*). For example, the presence of a digammate is hypothesized to explain sound changes in words related to the English word "wine".|近义词:  (No direct synonyms, as it refers to a reconstructed sound)|反义词: (N/A)|


USAGE->
(Digammate, as a reconstructed sound, doesn't have typical verb conjugations or other grammatical usages like the example word "what".  Its usage is solely within the field of historical linguistics.)


PHRASE->
(Digammate itself doesn't form phrases.  Phrases would relate to words derived from Proto-Indo-European roots where a digammate is hypothesized.)
