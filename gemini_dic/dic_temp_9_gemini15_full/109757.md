词源:
The word "levy" comes from the Old French word "lever," meaning "to raise" or "to lift."  This reflects the original meaning of the word, which was related to raising troops or collecting funds.  The modern meaning of "levy" as a tax or fee is a later development, but still related to the idea of gathering or collecting something.
