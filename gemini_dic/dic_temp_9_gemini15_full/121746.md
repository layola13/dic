misproud: /ˌmɪsˈpraʊd/ | adj. | 错误的自豪，错误的骄傲 |  This word is not a standard English word. It is a nonce word, meaning it's coined for a specific occasion and not found in standard dictionaries.  It combines the prefix "mis-" (wrongly, badly) with "proud."  It implies a pride that is misplaced, unjustified, or even harmful.  There is no established usage, synonyms, or antonyms for this word because it's not part of the standard lexicon.
