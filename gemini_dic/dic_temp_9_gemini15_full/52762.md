USAGE->
This word is an adverb, and as such, it doesn't have verb conjugations like "is," "was," "will be," etc.  It modifies verbs, describing *how* an action is performed.  Therefore, tense conjugations are irrelevant to the word itself.  Instead, we'll demonstrate its usage in different sentence structures.
