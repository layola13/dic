词源:

The word "overgesticulatively" is formed from:

* **over-**:  A prefix meaning "too much," "excessively," or "to a degree exceeding what is normal or desirable."
* **gesticulat-**: This comes from the verb "gesticulate," meaning "to make gestures, especially expressive ones, with one's hands or body."  "Gesticulate" itself is derived from the Late Latin word *gesticulatus*, the past participle of *gesticulāre*, meaning "to make gestures." This in turn comes from the Latin word *gestus*, meaning "gesture, deed, action."
* **-ive**: A suffix forming adjectives, meaning "having the nature of," "tending to," or "relating to."
* **-ly**: A suffix forming adverbs, meaning "in a ... manner" or "to a ... degree."

Therefore, "overgesticulatively" literally means "in a manner of excessively making gestures."
