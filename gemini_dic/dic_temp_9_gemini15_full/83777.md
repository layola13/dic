词源:
The word "hairdresser" is a compound word formed from "hair" and "dresser."  "Hair" refers to the filaments growing from the skin of humans and animals, and "dresser" originally meant someone who dressed or arranged things, in this case, hair.  The word evolved from the older term "hair-dresser," which is now largely archaic.
