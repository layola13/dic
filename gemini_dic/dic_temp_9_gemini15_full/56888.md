The word "doss's" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a very informal and regional variation.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It might be a possessive form of a word like "doss," which itself has limited standard usage.

To provide some possible interpretations, assuming it's a misspelling or a regionalism:

**Possible Interpretations and Speculations:**

* **If it's a misspelling of "dose's":**  This would be the possessive form of "dose," meaning a measured quantity of medicine or a quantity of something.

    * **/ˈdoʊzɪz/ (US) /ˈdəʊsɪz/ (UK)| n. |剂量，一份；(毒品)一剂| A measured amount of medicine or other substance.|  He took a dose of medicine. 他服了一剂药。| The doctor prescribed a high dose of antibiotics. 医生开了大剂量的抗生素。|  portion, quantity | antidote**

* **If it's a misspelling of "dross's":** This would be the possessive form of "dross," meaning waste or something worthless.

    * **/drɒs/ (UK) /drɑːs/ (US)| n. |废渣，渣滓；劣等品| Waste or unwanted material.| The gold was separated from the dross. 金子与废渣分离了。| The report was full of dross. 报告充满了废话。| refuse, rubbish, trash | pure, refined**

* **If it's a regional slang variant:**  "Doss" can informally refer to sleep or a place to sleep (especially in British English). "Doss's" in this context might be a possessive form indicating something belonging to a particular sleeping place or person who sleeps a lot.  However, this is highly speculative and depends on context.
