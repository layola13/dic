词源：
The word "self-regulating" is a compound word formed from "self," meaning "of, by, or for oneself," and "regulating," the present participle of the verb "regulate," which comes from the Latin word "regulare," meaning "to make straight, to adjust."  Therefore, "self-regulating" literally means "adjusting itself."
