词源:
The word "leery" likely originates from the Middle English word "lure," meaning "to entice or attract." Over time, the meaning shifted to suggest a sense of caution or suspicion, as one might be lured into a trap.  The "-y" suffix adds an adjectival quality, indicating a state or condition.  The connection to "lure" isn't etymologically direct, but rather a semantic evolution reflecting the wary nature of someone who is "leery."
