词源:
The word "dilapidated" comes from the Late Latin word "dilapidare," which means "to scatter," "to squander," or "to throw stones down." This word itself is derived from the Latin prefix "di-" (meaning "apart" or "away"), and "lapidare" (meaning "to stone").  The original sense related to the crumbling or scattering of stones in a building, hence the transition to describing a state of decay and disrepair.  The word entered English in the 16th century.
