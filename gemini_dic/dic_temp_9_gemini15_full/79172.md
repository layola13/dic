词源:

The word "glamorous" originated in the early 20th century as a variant of "glamour," which itself has a complex etymology.  "Glamour" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "grammarye," meaning "magic" or "witchcraft."  Over time, the meaning shifted to suggest an alluring, enchanting quality, often associated with a sense of mystery or illusion. The "-ous" suffix was added to create the adjective "glamorous," emphasizing the quality of being glamorous.
