preconfounding:/ˌpriːkənˈfaʊndɪŋ/| adj.| 预混杂的，预混淆的 |  Describes a situation where a variable influences both an exposure and an outcome, potentially leading to biased estimates of the exposure's effect on the outcome even before any confounding adjustment is made.  It is a type of bias that occurs before the study begins, often due to selection bias or inherent characteristics of the study population.  This differs from confounding, which occurs during the analysis stage. | Example:  The study showed evidence of preconfounding due to the unequal distribution of socioeconomic status between the treatment and control groups before any intervention.  This imbalance could distort the results regardless of subsequent adjustments. | 近义词：antecedent bias, pre-existing bias | 反义词：post-confounding (this is not a standard term, but conveys the opposite idea) |  adj.
