词源:

The word "nonapparentnesses" is formed from:

* **non-**: a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of"
* **apparent**:  adjective meaning "easily seen or understood; obvious"  (from Old French *aperir "to appear," from Latin *apparēre "to appear," from *ad- "to" + *parēre "to appear, seem")
* **-ness**: a suffix forming abstract nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.

Therefore, "nonapparentnesses" literally means "the state or quality of not being apparent or obvious".
