词源:

The word "presentation" comes from the Old French word "presentatioun," which in turn derives from the Latin word "praesentationem," a noun of action formed from the verb "praesentare," meaning "to present."  The Latin verb itself combines the prefix "prae-" (meaning "before" or "in front of") and the verb "sentire" (meaning "to feel" or "to perceive").  Therefore, the core meaning points to the act of bringing something "before" someone for their perception or consideration.
