词源:

The word "chesterfield" derives its name from Philip Dormer Stanhope, 4th Earl of Chesterfield (1694-1773), a prominent British statesman and author known for his refined taste and elegant lifestyle. While he didn't invent the sofa style, its association with his name and the era of refined elegance helped solidify its identity and popularize the term.
