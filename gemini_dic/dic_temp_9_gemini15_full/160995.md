postarmistices: /ˌpoʊstɑːrˈmɪstɪsiːz/ | n. | 停战后时期 | The period after an armistice; the time following the cessation of hostilities in a war.  It often refers to the period of adjustment and rebuilding that follows a war.  | Example: The postarmistices period saw a surge in reconstruction efforts across the ravaged nation. = 停战后时期见证了整个饱受战争摧残的国家重建工作的激增。


The word is formed from "post-" (after, following) + "armistice" (a temporary suspension of hostilities). There are no direct synonyms or antonyms, as the word refers to a specific historical period.  The closest synonyms might describe aspects of the period, such as "reconstruction," "recovery," or "peacetime," but none fully capture the specific meaning of "postarmistices."  Antonyms would be terms related to wartime, such as "conflict," "hostilities," or "war."
