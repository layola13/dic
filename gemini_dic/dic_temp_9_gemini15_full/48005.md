decipherability:/ˌdiːˌsaɪfərəˈbɪləti/| n. |可解读性，可破译性 |The decipherability of the code was crucial to understanding the message.  代码的可解读性对于理解信息至关重要。|近义词：intelligibility, understandability |反义词：unintelligibility, obscurity


英文解析：Decipherability refers to the ease with which something, typically a code, cipher, or message, can be understood or decoded.  A high degree of decipherability indicates that the text is easily understood, while low decipherability suggests it is difficult or impossible to understand without significant effort.


词源:  The word "decipherability" is derived from the verb "decipher," which comes from the Old French "deschiffrer," meaning "to decipher."  This, in turn, originates from the Medieval Latin "de-" (remove) + "cifra" (cipher, zero).  The "-ability" suffix denotes the capacity or potential for something.
