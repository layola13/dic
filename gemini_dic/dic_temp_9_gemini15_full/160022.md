USAGE->
This word is primarily used in literary analysis and discussions of rhetoric; it doesn't have typical grammatical tenses or voice usage like verbs.  It describes a stylistic choice, not a grammatical structure.  Therefore, providing example sentences in different tenses would be inappropriate.


PHRASE->
Polysyndeton is not typically used in phrases in the way a verb or noun might be. It's a descriptive term for a particular rhetorical device.  It is best understood in the context of literary analysis, not as a word that participates in common phrases.
