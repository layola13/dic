词源:

The word "overtrimming" is a compound word formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the noun "trimming" (the act of cutting or removing excess parts).  "Trimming" itself originates from the Old English word "trimman," meaning "to cut, shape, or decorate."
