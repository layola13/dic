词源:
The word "hiccup" comes from the Middle English word "hikcup," which is likely of onomatopoeic origin, meaning it imitates the sound it describes.  The word's origins trace back to Proto-Germanic roots and its evolution reflects the natural tendency of language to create words that mimic sounds.
