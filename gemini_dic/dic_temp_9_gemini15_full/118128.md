The word "menow" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a neologism: A newly coined word not yet widely accepted.  If this is the case, please provide context so I can attempt to understand its meaning.
* It's slang or jargon: Specific to a certain group or region.  Again, context is crucial.
* It's a proper noun:  A name or place.

Please clarify the word or provide more context so I can assist you.
