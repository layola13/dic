PHRASE->
There is no common multi-word phrase specifically using "disceptation."  The word itself is relatively formal and rarely appears in phrasal constructions.  Instead, phrases would revolve around the *act* of disceptation, such as:

engage in a disceptation, participate in a disceptation, lead a disceptation, present a disceptation, submit a disceptation.


词源:
The word "disceptation" is derived from the Latin word "disceptare," meaning "to discuss," "to argue," or "to debate."  It's a less common variant, with "dissertation" being the more frequently used term for a formal written argument, especially an academic one.
