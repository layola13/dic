词源:

The word "macabre" comes from the Old French word "macabre," which ultimately derives from the Medieval Latin phrase "danse macabre," meaning "dance of death."  The "danse macabre" was a popular artistic and literary motif in the Middle Ages and Renaissance, depicting skeletons dancing and celebrating death.  The word entered English in the 18th century.
