kmer:/ˈkeɪmər/| n. |k-元组，k-聚体|A k-mer is a subsequence of length k within a longer sequence, such as a DNA or protein sequence.  In bioinformatics, k-mers are frequently used in sequence assembly, genome mapping, and other applications.  They are essentially all possible subsequences of length k that can be found within a given sequence. |Example: In the DNA sequence "ATGCAT", the 3-mers (or trimers) are ATG, TGC, GCA, and CAT. |近义词：subsequence, oligonucleotide (for DNA k-mers)|反义词：无


USAGE->
There is no grammatical conjugation for "k-mer" as it is a noun.  The usage depends on the context of its application within a sentence.

Example 1:  The analysis identified several unique 20-mers in the viral genome.  = 分析在病毒基因组中鉴定出几个独特的20-元组。

Example 2:  We used a k-mer frequency approach to assemble the fragmented reads. = 我们使用k-元组频率方法来组装碎片化的reads。
