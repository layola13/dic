PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "disembowelled".  The word is primarily used in its literal sense, and often in violent or graphic contexts.

词源:
The word comes from the Old French "deseboueler," which itself is a combination of the Old French prefix "des-" (meaning "to remove" or "to deprive of") and  "eboueler," (meaning "to gut" or "to disembowel").  The ultimate roots lie in the Vulgar Latin word *ex-butulare, meaning "to remove the entrails”.
