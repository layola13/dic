词源:
The word "elapsion" is derived from the verb "elapse," meaning "to pass or go by (said of time)."  "Elapse" itself has roots in Latin, specifically from the verb *elabi*, meaning "to slip away" or "to glide away."  The suffix "-ion" creates a noun form indicating the action or process of elapsing.
