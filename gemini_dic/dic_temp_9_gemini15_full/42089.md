cotransduces:/ˌkoʊtrænzˈduːsɪz/| v.| 共同转导 |  Cotransduction refers to the simultaneous transfer of two or more genes from one bacterium to another during transduction, a process where genetic material is transferred from one bacterium to another via a bacteriophage (a virus that infects bacteria).  This occurs when the genes are located close together on the bacterial chromosome. | Example:  The experiment demonstrated that genes A and B were cotransduced, indicating their proximity on the bacterial genome.  共同转导实验证明基因A和B是共同转导的，表明它们在细菌基因组上彼此靠近。|近义词: cotransfer, |反义词:  (no direct antonym, the opposite would imply separate transduction of genes)| 动词


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The bacteriophage cotransduces multiple genes. = 噬菌体共同转导多个基因。
This process frequently cotransduces linked genes. = 此过程经常共同转导连锁基因。

一般过去时:
The researchers cotransduced two genes of interest. = 研究人员共同转导了两个感兴趣的基因。
The experiment showed that the genes were cotransduced. = 实验表明这些基因是共同转导的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have cotransduced many genes using this technique. = 科学家们已经使用这种技术共同转导了许多基因。
They have successfully cotransduced the desired genes into the host bacterium. = 他们已经成功地将所需的基因共同转导到宿主细菌中。


过去完成时:
They had cotransduced the genes before the final analysis. = 在最终分析之前，他们已经共同转导了这些基因。
The study showed that the genes had been cotransduced. = 研究表明这些基因已经被共同转导。


将来时:
We will cotransduce these genes in the next experiment. = 我们将在下一个实验中共同转导这些基因。
Researchers will likely cotransduce more genes in the future. = 研究人员将来可能会共同转导更多基因。


虚拟语气:
If we cotransduced those genes, we would get different results. = 如果我们共同转导那些基因，我们会得到不同的结果。
It would be helpful if we could cotransduce all three genes simultaneously. = 如果我们能够同时共同转导所有三个基因，那将很有帮助。


被动语态:
Two genes were cotransduced in the experiment. = 在实验中，两个基因被共同转导。
Many genes have been cotransduced using this method. = 使用这种方法，许多基因已经被共同转导。


疑问句:
Were the genes cotransduced in the previous experiment? = 在之前的实验中，这些基因是否被共同转导？
How many genes were cotransduced? = 共同转导了多少个基因？


否定句:
The genes were not cotransduced. = 这些基因没有被共同转导。
The experiment failed to cotransduce the target genes. = 实验未能共同转导目标基因。
