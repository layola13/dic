词源：The word "moxy" is of uncertain origin.  While its exact etymology remains debated, it's likely derived from either a now-obsolete word or a dialectical variant.  One theory suggests it's related to the Old French word "moxie," meaning "muscular." Another suggests a connection to a now-obsolete word "moxe," possibly referring to "strength" or "spirit." The word's usage began to gain traction in the late 19th century, solidifying its place in American English vocabulary by the early 20th century.  Its current meaning aligns more closely with "boldness" or "spiritedness" than with pure physical strength.
