词源：The word is a combination of "quasi," meaning "seemingly" or "apparently," and "candid," meaning "frank" or "open."  The prefix "quasi-" derives from Latin, indicating a resemblance or approximation. "Candid" comes from the Latin word "candidus," meaning "white," originally referring to the white toga worn by Roman candidates for office, signifying their purity and honesty.  The association with honesty developed over time.
