词源:  The word "intermaze" is a relatively modern coinage. It's a blend of "inter-" (meaning "between," "among," or "reciprocally") and "maze" (a complex network of paths).  It suggests a maze-like situation involving multiple interconnected elements.  There's no established etymology beyond this composition.
