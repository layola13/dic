mateyness's:/ˈmeɪtɪnəsɪz/| n. |伙伴关系的特征；朋友般的亲密；同志情谊|The word "mateyness's" is not a standard English word. It appears to be an attempt to make "mateyness" possessive, but  "mateyness" itself is relatively informal and uncommon.  It refers to the quality or state of being matey, characterized by friendliness, camaraderie, and familiarity. It suggests a close, informal relationship between people, often implying a sense of shared experience or belonging.  The possessive form "mateyness's" would be used to describe something belonging to or characteristic of this quality. For example, "The mateyness's warmth filled the room."  However, this usage is grammatically awkward and unnatural. A better approach would be to rephrase the sentence to avoid the awkward possessive. |例句：The team's mateyness was evident in their collaborative spirit. (团队的伙伴情谊在他们协作的精神中显而易见。)|近义词：camaraderie, companionship, fellowship, friendliness|反义词：estrangement, animosity, hostility
