heterogamous:/ˌhetərˈɒɡəməs/| adj.|异配的；异型配子的|Relating to or characterized by heterogamy;  involving the fusion of gametes that differ in size, shape, or function.  This is common in many plant and animal species, where one gamete (typically the egg) is large and non-motile, and the other (typically the sperm) is small and motile.|例句：Many flowering plants exhibit heterogamous reproduction, with distinct male and female flowers.|近义词：anisogamous|反义词：isogamous
