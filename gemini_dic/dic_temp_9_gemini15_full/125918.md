词源:  The word "musette" comes from the French word  "musette," which originally referred to a small bagpipe.  The association with small bags likely stemmed from the size and shape of the instrument's carrying case.  The later meaning of a type of French folk dance is also derived from this association with the bagpipe as the accompanying instrument.
