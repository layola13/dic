词源:
The word "nonprosaicness" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), the adjective "prosaic" (meaning dull, commonplace, or unimaginative), and the suffix "-ness" (meaning "the state or quality of").  Therefore, "nonprosaicness" signifies the absence of prosaic qualities, or the state of being unprosaic.
