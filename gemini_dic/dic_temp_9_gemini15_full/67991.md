词源:
Factionalism derives from the word "faction," which comes from the Latin word "factio," meaning "a group of people acting together, especially in politics."  The suffix "-ism" denotes a system, practice, or doctrine.  Therefore, factionalism refers to the activities, beliefs, or state of being characterized by factions and their conflicts.
