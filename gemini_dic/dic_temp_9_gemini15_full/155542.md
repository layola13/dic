The word "philippium" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide a response in the requested format.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a technical term from a specific field, or a word from a fictional language.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer further assistance.
