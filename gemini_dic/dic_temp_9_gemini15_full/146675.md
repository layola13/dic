词源:
The word "overhead projector" is a compound word.  "Overhead" refers to the position of the projector, typically above the presenter's head, and "projector" refers to the device that projects an image.  The individual words have roots in older English and Latin:

* **Overhead:**  "Over" (Old English) + "head" (Old English).
* **Projector:**  From "project" (Latin "proicere," meaning "to throw forward"),  "-or" being a suffix indicating an agent or instrument.
