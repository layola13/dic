词源:
The word "detractiveness" is derived from the verb "detract," which comes from the Latin prefix "de-" (meaning "away from" or "down from") and the verb "trahere" (meaning "to draw" or "to pull").  Therefore, "detract" originally meant "to draw away from" or "to take away from," implying a lessening or diminishing of something positive.  The suffix "-ive" transforms the verb into an adjective ("detractive"), meaning "tending to detract," and adding "-ness" creates the noun "detractiveness," signifying the quality or state of being detractive.
