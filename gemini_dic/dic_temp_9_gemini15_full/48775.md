词源:
The word "deflating" comes from the verb "deflate," meaning to reduce or lessen something, especially air or gas from something inflated.  It's ultimately derived from the Latin prefix "de-" (away, down, from) and the Latin word "flare" (to blow).  The sense of reducing enthusiasm or spirits is a metaphorical extension of the original meaning of reducing air pressure.
