The word "kiche" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?

2. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (like a name or place) that isn't widely known.  More context is needed.

3. **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language. If you can provide the language of origin, it might be possible to provide a translation and explanation.

4. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word or a slang term used within a specific community.

Without more information, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  Please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
