词源：
From the French verb *riposter*, meaning "to reply," ultimately derived from the Italian verb *ripistare*, a compound of *ri-* (again) and *pistare* (to strike, to thrust).  The original sense referred to a fencing term, referring to a quick return thrust.  The figurative sense, signifying a quick and clever verbal response, developed later.
