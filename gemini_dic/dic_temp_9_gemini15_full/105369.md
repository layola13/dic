kickshoe: /ˈkɪkʃuː/ | n. |踢鞋；(尤指)舞鞋 | A kickshoe is a type of shoe, often lightweight and flexible, designed for dancing or other activities requiring nimble footwork.  The term is somewhat informal and may refer to various types of shoes depending on context.  It often implies a shoe suitable for kicking or dancing. | 例句：She wore her kickshoes to the tap-dancing class. 她穿着踢踏舞鞋去上踢踏舞课。

The term "kickshoes" is not found in standard dictionaries and lacks a formal etymological entry. Its meaning is derived from the combination of "kick" (referring to the action of kicking) and "shoe."  The "kick" element suggests the shoe's suitability for activities involving forceful movements of the feet.
