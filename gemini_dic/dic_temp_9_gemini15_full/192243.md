词源:
The word "screamer" originates from the verb "scream," meaning to utter a loud, sharp cry.  The suffix "-er" is an agentive suffix, indicating a person or thing that performs the action of the verb.  Therefore, "screamer" literally means "one who screams" or "something that makes a screaming sound."  The evolution of the word's meaning to include "something shocking or dramatic" is a metaphorical extension, reflecting the intensity and suddenness associated with a scream.
