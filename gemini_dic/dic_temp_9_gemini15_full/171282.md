pterygoquadrate:/ˌtɛriɡoʊˈkwɑːdreɪt/| n. |翼状方骨 |The pterygoquadrate is a cartilaginous or bony element in the jaw suspension of many vertebrates, particularly in fishes and amphibians.  It articulates with the lower jaw (mandible) and contributes to the formation of the jaw joint.  In some vertebrates, it is fused with other bones to form part of the skull. |The pterygoquadrate bone in sharks is crucial for jaw movement. |近义词：palatoquadrate (部分情况下)|反义词：无
