词源:
The word "giant" comes from the Old French word "geanz," which in turn originates from the Latin word "gigas," meaning a giant.  The Latin word is related to the Greek word "γίγας" (gigas), also meaning giant.  The ultimate origin is likely Proto-Indo-European *gīǵās,  though its exact meaning and relationship to other words is debated amongst etymologists.
