词源:
The word "doppelganger" is of German origin. It's a compound word formed from "Doppel-", meaning "double," and "gänger," meaning "goer" or "walker."  Therefore, a literal translation would be "double-goer" or "double-walker." The term entered English from German in the 19th century, largely due to its use in Romantic-era literature.
