词源:The word "cuckold" ultimately derives from the Old French word *cuculd*, which in turn comes from the Old French word *coucou*, meaning "cuckoo."  The cuckoo bird is known for its habit of laying its eggs in the nests of other birds, thus raising its young at the expense of the other bird's parental care.  This parasitic behavior formed the basis of the metaphorical association with a husband whose wife is unfaithful, as the cuckold's wife is essentially raising another man's child.
