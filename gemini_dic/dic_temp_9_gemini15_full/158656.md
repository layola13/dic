The word "plitt" does not exist in standard English.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information according to the requested format.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A regional dialect word:**  It might be a word used in a specific region or community.  Providing more context (where you encountered this word) would be helpful.
* **A neologism or newly coined word:**  If it's a newly created word, it won't have an established definition or etymology yet.
* **A proper noun:**  It could be a name or place name.
