disrudder:/dɪsˈrʌdər/| n. |扰流板，破坏舵|A device, often aerodynamic, designed to disrupt or redirect airflow, typically to reduce drag or improve stability.  It can also refer to a mechanism that intentionally disrupts a rudder's function.|例句：The aircraft's disrudder helped maintain stability during turbulent flight.  飞机的扰流板帮助在湍流飞行中保持稳定。|近义词：spoiler, airbrake, drag device |反义词：stabilizer


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The disrudder reduces drag during high-speed flight. = 扰流板在高速飞行时减少阻力。
The disrudder improves directional control. = 扰流板提高了方向控制。


一般过去时:
The pilot deployed the disrudder to slow the plane down. = 飞行员放下扰流板以减慢飞机速度。
The malfunctioning disrudder caused instability. = 扰流板故障导致不稳定。


现在完成时:
The engineers have improved the design of the disrudder. = 工程师们改进了扰流板的设计。
They have tested the new disrudder extensively. = 他们对新型扰流板进行了广泛的测试。


过去完成时:
The pilot had activated the disrudder before the landing. = 飞行员在着陆前已经启动了扰流板。
The problem with the disrudder had been identified before the flight. = 飞行前已经发现了扰流板的问题。


将来时:
The new aircraft will have an advanced disrudder system. = 新飞机将拥有先进的扰流板系统。
They will test the disrudder's effectiveness in a wind tunnel. = 他们将在风洞中测试扰流板的有效性。


虚拟语气:
If the disrudder had functioned correctly, the accident would not have happened. = 如果扰流板能正常工作，事故就不会发生了。
I wish the disrudder had been more effective. = 我希望扰流板更有效。


被动语态:
The disrudder was deployed automatically during the emergency landing. = 在紧急着陆期间，扰流板自动启动。
The disrudder is being tested for its stability characteristics. = 正在测试扰流板的稳定性特征。


疑问句:
Is the disrudder working correctly? = 扰流板工作正常吗？
What type of disrudder does this aircraft use? = 这架飞机使用哪种类型的扰流板？


否定句:
The disrudder did not deploy as expected. = 扰流板没有按预期启动。
The plane did not have a functional disrudder. = 这架飞机没有功能正常的扰流板。


PHRASE->
disrudder deployment = 扰流板展开
disrudder system = 扰流板系统
disrudder control = 扰流板控制
disrudder effectiveness = 扰流板效率
active disrudder = 主动扰流板
