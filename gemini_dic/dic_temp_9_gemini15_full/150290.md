近义词：panelled, paneled (US spelling) | 反义词：unpanelled, plain


词源:  From "panel," ultimately from Old French *pannel, a piece of cloth or leather, from Old French pane "piece of bread" (related to Latin panis "bread"). The extension of meaning to wooden panels likely arose from the similarity in shape and function to pieces of cloth or leather used as coverings.
