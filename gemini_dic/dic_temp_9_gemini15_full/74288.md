fractal:/ˈfræktəl/| n. |分形，碎形|A fractal is a geometric shape that is self-similar; that is, its parts have the same shape as the whole.  Fractals are often infinitely complex, meaning they have details at arbitrarily small scales. They are found in many natural phenomena, such as coastlines, snowflakes, and trees.|例句：The coastline is a classic example of a fractal.|近义词：self-similar pattern|反义词：Euclidean geometry


USAGE->
