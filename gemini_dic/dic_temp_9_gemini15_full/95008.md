词源:The term is a relatively recent addition to the English language, arising from its use in describing aggressive and confrontational styles in various fields, particularly in art and music.  It's a descriptive phrase that gained popularity as slang before being adopted into more formal contexts.  The literal meaning reflects the directness of the approach – as if something is being thrust directly "in your face."
