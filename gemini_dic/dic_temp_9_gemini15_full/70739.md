词源:
The word "fine" has a long and interesting history. Its origins trace back to the Old French word "fin," meaning "end," "limit," "conclusion," or even "refined" or "subtle." This Old French word ultimately derives from the Latin word "finis," which carries similar meanings. Over time, "fin" evolved in Middle English to encompass various meanings, including "excellent," "subtle," "delicate," and "refined," eventually leading to the multifaceted word "fine" we use today.  The sense of "penalty" is a later development, related to the idea of a "final" or concluding payment.
