词源:  Derived from "classical," ultimately from Latin *classicus,  meaning "of the first class" or "belonging to the highest rank,"  referring to the highest class of Roman citizens.  This sense evolved to describe works of superior artistic merit and enduring value, which became associated with ancient Greece and Rome. The suffix "-ity" forms nouns of quality or state.
