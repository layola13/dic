colloid:/ˈkɔɪd/| n. |胶体，胶状物质 |A colloid is a substance consisting of particles dispersed throughout another substance.  These particles are larger than those in a solution but smaller than those in a suspension, and are not easily separated by filtration.  Colloids exhibit the Tyndall effect, scattering light to appear cloudy or opaque. |Example: Milk is an example of a colloid, with fat globules dispersed in water.牛奶是胶体的一个例子，脂肪球分散在水中。|近义词：suspension, emulsion|反义词：solution

词源:
The word "colloid" comes from the Greek word "kolla," meaning "glue," reflecting the often glue-like consistency of colloidal substances.  The suffix "-oid" indicates "resembling" or "having the form of."
