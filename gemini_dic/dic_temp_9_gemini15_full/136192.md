nonrelativities:/ˌnɒnˌreləˈtɪvɪtiz/| n. |非相对性；非相对论的现象|The study of nonrelativities focuses on phenomena that are not adequately described by the theory of relativity.  研究非相对性专注于不能用相对论充分描述的现象。|近义词：non-relativistic effects|反义词：relativities


The word "nonrelativities" is not a standard or commonly used word in the English language. It's a neologism, meaning a newly coined word or expression.  It's formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "relativities," the plural of "relativity."

**Etymology:**

* **non-:**  A prefix meaning "not," "opposite of," or "lacking."  Derived from Old French *non* and ultimately from Latin *non*.
* **relativity:** This refers to the theory of relativity in physics, specifically Einstein's theories of special and general relativity.  It describes the relationship between space, time, gravity, and the speed of light.  The root is related to the Latin word *relatus*, the past participle of *referre*, meaning "to bring back," "to relate," or "to refer."


**Usage:**

Because "nonrelativities" is not a standard word, there are no established grammatical usages or set phrases.  Its meaning is derived from its components:  it would refer to phenomena or aspects of physics, or perhaps other fields of study, that are outside the scope or explanatory power of the theory of relativity.  One would likely use more specific terminology to describe these phenomena, depending on the field.

**Example of potential usage in a hypothetical context:**

"In low-velocity systems, the effects of nonrelativities are negligible, and Newtonian mechanics provides a sufficient approximation."  在低速系统中，非相对性的影响可以忽略不计，牛顿力学提供了足够的近似。

**Note:**  The word "nonrelativistic" (adjective) is a standard term used to describe phenomena or systems where the effects of relativity are insignificant.  This is the more appropriate term to use instead of "nonrelativities" in most scientific contexts.

Because "nonrelativities" is not a standard term, providing examples across various grammatical tenses or moods would be artificial and inaccurate. The word simply doesn't have established grammatical use.  The example above illustrates its potential use in a declarative sentence.
