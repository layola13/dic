kludges:/klʌdʒ/ | n. | 权宜之计；临时凑合的解决方法；粗制滥造的东西 | A kludge is a clumsy or inelegant solution to a problem, often a quick fix that is not well-designed or efficient but works.  It's typically a temporary workaround until a more permanent solution can be implemented.  The term often implies a lack of elegance or sophistication. | Example:  The software contained several kludges to make it work with the older hardware.  这个软件包含几个权宜之计以使其能够与旧硬件一起工作。


Example: The programmer used a kludge to fix the bug quickly, but it made the code harder to maintain. 程序员用权宜之计快速修复了bug，但这使得代码更难维护。
