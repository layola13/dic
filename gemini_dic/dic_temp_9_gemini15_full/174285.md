词源:  The word is a relatively recent coinage, a blend of "quest" (meaning a search or pursuit, often implying something contentious) and "monger" (meaning a dealer or trader, often implying something negative, as in "warmonger").  The "monger" suffix suggests someone who actively deals in or promotes the activity indicated by the first part of the word.  Therefore, a questmonger is someone who actively seeks out and promotes conflict.
