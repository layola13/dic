The word "{jibing}" is not an English word.  It appears to be a transliteration of a word from another language, possibly Chinese, meaning "disease" or "illness".  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis in the requested format as if it were a standard English word.  To help, I need the correct spelling and language of origin.  If you provide the correct word, I can then offer a detailed analysis as requested.
