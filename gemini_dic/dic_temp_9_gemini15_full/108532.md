词源:The word "lazarly" is derived from "Lazarus," the name of a biblical figure famously raised from the dead by Jesus (John 11).  Over time, "Lazarus" became associated with poverty, sickness, and destitution, and the adjective "lazarly" emerged to describe someone exhibiting characteristics reminiscent of a beggar or someone in a state of neglect and disrepair.  The association likely stems from the image of Lazarus in his grave-like state before his resurrection.
