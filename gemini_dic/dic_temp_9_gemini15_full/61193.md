elute:/ɪˈluːt/| vt.|洗脱；溶出；淋洗|To remove (a substance) from a solid phase by washing it with a solvent.  This is commonly used in chromatography and other separation techniques. |例句：The scientists eluted the proteins from the column using a gradient buffer. 科学家们用梯度缓冲液从柱上洗脱蛋白质。

例句：We eluted the DNA from the gel using a specific buffer. 我们用特异性缓冲液从凝胶中洗脱DNA。


近义词：extract, leach, wash out|反义词：retain, absorb|词性:动词
