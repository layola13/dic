The word "hullo's" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a non-standard or possibly misspelled version of "hullo," or a possessive form of "hullo" incorrectly formed.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  Let's analyze "hullo" instead.


hullo: /ˈhʌləʊ/ (British English) /ˈhʌloʊ/ (American English)| int. |你好|A somewhat old-fashioned or informal greeting, similar to "hello".  It's more common in British English.| Hullo, how are you doing today? = 你好，你今天过得怎么样？|Hello, hi|Goodbye, farewell|Interjection


USAGE->
(Since "hullo" is an interjection, it doesn't have tenses or other grammatical forms like a verb or noun.)


PHRASE->
(There are no common phrases specifically using "hullo," as it's largely a standalone greeting.)

Note that "hullo's" might be intended as a possessive form ("hullo's greeting"), but this is grammatically incorrect. The correct possessive form would be "hullo's" but only if used appropriately within a sentence with a noun following it.  For example: "That was a cheery hullo's greeting".  Even so, using "hullo" in this context is not standard.  "Hello's" would be a more common, albeit still somewhat informal, usage.
