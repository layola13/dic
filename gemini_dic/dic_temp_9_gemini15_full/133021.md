The word is formed from:

* **non-**:  A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of."
* **entomo-**: A combining form derived from the Greek word "éntomon" (ἔντομον), meaning "insect."
* **-logic**: A suffix meaning "related to" or "study of," ultimately derived from the Greek word "logos" (λόγος), meaning "word," "reason," or "study."

Therefore, "nonentomologic" literally means "not related to the study of insects."
