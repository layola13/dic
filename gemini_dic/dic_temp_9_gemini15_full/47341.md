词源:
The word "de-sludge" is a compound word formed by combining the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to deprive of") with the noun "sludge" (a thick, soft, wet mud or sediment).  Therefore, "de-sludge" literally means "to remove sludge."  There's no single historical event or person credited with its creation; it's a straightforward and logical combination reflecting the action.
