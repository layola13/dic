quasi-constructive: /ˈkwɑːzaɪ kənˈstrʌktɪv/ | adj. | 准构造性的；似构造性的 |  Approaching or resembling a constructive method, but not fully or strictly so; implying a partially constructive approach, often with limitations or imperfections. It suggests a method that builds something up, but may lack rigor, completeness, or efficiency of a truly constructive method.


英文解析:The term "quasi-constructive" indicates a process or method that shares characteristics with constructive methods but falls short of being fully constructive.  It might involve approximations, heuristics, or compromises that deviate from the strict standards of a truly constructive approach.  For example, a quasi-constructive proof might provide a strong indication of a result's truth but not meet the full requirements of a formal constructive proof.

A quasi-constructive algorithm for solving the problem was developed, balancing speed with accuracy. = 开发了一种解决该问题的准构造算法，在速度和精度之间取得平衡。
