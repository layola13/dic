词源:

The origin of "hit the fan" is unclear.  The most commonly accepted theory is that it's a euphemism for the chaotic aftermath of an explosion.  The image of debris (like "shit") being scattered like the blades of a fan suggests a sudden, widespread mess.  The idiom became popular in the mid-20th century.
