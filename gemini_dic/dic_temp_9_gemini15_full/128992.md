词源:
The word "nippitate" is a relatively recent coinage, likely formed by combining elements suggestive of "nip" (to pinch or bite, implying a sudden reduction) and a suffix suggesting action or effect.  There is no established etymological root tracing it to older words.  Its usage reflects a creative and somewhat informal approach to word creation.
