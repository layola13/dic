WORD ORIGIN:

The word "quasi-native" is a compound word.

* **quasi-**:  This prefix comes from Latin, meaning "as if," "seemingly," or "apparently."  It indicates that something possesses the characteristics of something else, but not completely or perfectly.

* **native**: This word comes from the Latin word "nativus," meaning "born," "belonging to one's birth," or "native."  It refers to something inherent, natural, or belonging originally to a place or person.


Therefore, "quasi-native" literally means "as if native," or "almost native."
