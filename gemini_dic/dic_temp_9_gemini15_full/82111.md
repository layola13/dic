词源:  Derived from "groggy," meaning  dazed or weak, possibly from the drink "grog" (a mixture of rum and water), which itself might be from the name of Admiral Edward Vernon, who introduced it.  The suffix "-ified" transforms the adjective "groggy" into a past participle, suggesting a state of being made groggy.  The evolution of meaning suggests a progression from simply being dazed to being heavily intoxicated.
