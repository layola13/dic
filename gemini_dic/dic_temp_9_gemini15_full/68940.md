The word "fateful" originates from the Old English word "fæt," meaning "fate" or "destiny."  The suffix "-ful" signifies "full of" or "characterized by." Thus, "fateful" means "full of fate" or "marked by fate."  Its meaning has evolved to encompass both positive and negative connotations,  reflecting the unpredictable nature of fate itself.
