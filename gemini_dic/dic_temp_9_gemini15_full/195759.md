词源:

The word "semitruthfully" is formed from the following elements:

* **semi-**: A prefix meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."  It derives from Latin "semi-".

* **truthfully**: An adverb meaning "in a truthful manner," derived from "truth" (Old English "triewþ") and "-fully" (an adverbial suffix).


The word combines the partial nature indicated by "semi" with the manner of speaking truthfully, resulting in a description of a statement or action that is only partly true.
