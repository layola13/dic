词源:
The word "misavering" is a relatively uncommon word formed by combining "mis-" (meaning wrongly or badly) and "averring" (a less common word meaning stating or asserting).  "Averring" itself comes from the Old French "averer," meaning "to prove true" or "to verify."  Thus, "misavering" describes an act of wrongly stating or asserting something, often in relation to the misuse of funds or property.  It suggests a deliberate action, often for personal gain, that involves misrepresentation or deception.
