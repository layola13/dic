nematode:/ˈnɛmətoʊd/| n. |线虫；线形动物|A nematode is a type of worm belonging to the phylum Nematoda.  They are unsegmented, cylindrical worms with a tough, flexible outer covering. Nematodes are found in almost every habitat on Earth, from soil and water to the bodies of plants and animals. Many are microscopic, while others can reach several centimeters in length.  Some nematodes are parasitic, causing diseases in plants and animals, while others are free-living and play important roles in nutrient cycling.|例句：Many plant diseases are caused by parasitic nematodes.  许多植物病害是由寄生线虫引起的。


例句：Scientists are studying the role of nematodes in soil health. 科学家们正在研究线虫在土壤健康中的作用。|近义词：worm, roundworm |反义词：None specifically, but "non-nematode" could be used to describe something that isn't a nematode.
