formability:/ˌfɔːrməˈbɪləti/| n. |可成形性，可塑性 |The ability of a material to be shaped or formed into a desired configuration without fracture or excessive deformation.  This property is crucial in manufacturing processes involving bending, drawing, stamping, and other forming techniques.  The formability of a material is influenced by factors such as its strength, ductility, and elasticity.|例句：The high formability of aluminum makes it ideal for aerospace applications.  铝的高可成形性使其成为航空航天应用的理想材料。

The superior formability of this new alloy allows for complex shapes to be produced easily.  这种新型合金优异的可成形性使得能够轻松生产复杂的形状。|近义词：ductility, malleability, plasticity |反义词：brittleness, rigidity
