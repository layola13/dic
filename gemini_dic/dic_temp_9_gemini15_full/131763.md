In chemistry, it could describe molecules that do not readily conjugate.  |  例句：The study investigated the nonconjugalities in the molecular structure and their impact on reactivity.  这项研究调查了分子结构中的非共轭性及其对反应活性的影响。

The absence of a conjugated system in a chemical compound was a key factor leading to its nonconjugalities.  一个化学化合物中缺乏共轭体系是导致其非共轭性的一个关键因素。| 近义词: disjunction, disconnect, non-union | 反义词: conjugation, union, connectivity |  词性: noun
