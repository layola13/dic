quasi-nebulous: /ˈkwɑːziˈnɛbjələs/ | adj. | 模糊不清的，似是而非的 |


英文解析:  The word "quasi-nebulous" combines "quasi," meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent," with "nebulous," meaning "vague," "unclear," or "cloud-like."  Therefore, "quasi-nebulous" describes something that is somewhat vague or unclear, but not entirely so; it possesses a certain indistinctness or haziness.

The plan was quasi-nebulous, with only a few key details fleshed out. =  这个计划模糊不清，只有少数几个关键细节被详细说明。

His explanation of the incident was quasi-nebulous, leaving many questions unanswered. = 他对事件的解释模糊不清，留下许多悬而未决的问题。
