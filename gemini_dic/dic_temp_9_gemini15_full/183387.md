reprojection:/ˌriːprəˈdʒɛkʃən/| n. |重新投影；再投影|The process of projecting something again, often after transformation or correction.  This commonly involves transforming coordinates from one coordinate system to another. For example, in computer vision, reprojection refers to transforming 3D points to 2D image coordinates, often to compare with detected features.  | Example: The image underwent reprojection to correct for lens distortion.  重新投影图像以校正镜头畸变。|近义词：remapping, transformation|反义词：projection (in the sense of initial projection)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The software reprojects the 3D model onto the 2D plane. = 软件将3D模型重新投影到2D平面上。
Reprojection corrects for errors in the initial projection. = 重新投影校正了初始投影中的错误。


一般过去时:
The engineers reprojected the data to a different coordinate system. = 工程师们将数据重新投影到不同的坐标系。
They reprojected the image to remove the distortion. = 他们重新投影图像以去除畸变。


现在完成时:
The team has reprojected the satellite imagery multiple times. = 该团队已经多次重新投影卫星图像。
We have reprojected the point cloud to align it with the reference frame. = 我们已经重新投影点云以使其与参考系对齐。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, they had reprojected all the images. = 分析之前，他们已经重新投影了所有图像。
The system had reprojected the data before displaying it. = 系统在显示数据之前已经对其进行了重新投影。


将来时:
We will reproject the data using a more accurate model. = 我们将使用更精确的模型重新投影数据。
The software will automatically reproject the images after calibration. = 校准后，软件将自动重新投影图像。


虚拟语气:
If we had better data, we could reproject the image more accurately. = 如果我们有更好的数据，我们可以更准确地重新投影图像。
It would be beneficial if the system reprojected the points in real time. = 如果系统能够实时重新投影点，将是有益的。


被动语态:
The image was reprojected to correct for perspective distortion. = 图像被重新投影以校正透视畸变。
The data points are reprojected onto the map. = 数据点被重新投影到地图上。


疑问句:
Has the image been reprojected? = 图像是否已经被重新投影？
Will the points be reprojected automatically? = 点是否会自动重新投影？


否定句:
The system did not reprojected the data correctly. = 系统没有正确地重新投影数据。
The image was not reprojected because of insufficient data. =由于数据不足，图像未被重新投影。


PHRASE->
reprojection error: 重新投影误差
bundle adjustment reprojection:  光束法平差重新投影
