perichordal: /ˌpɛrɪˈkɔːrdəl/ | adj. | 脊索旁的；围绕脊索的 | Relating to or situated near or around the notochord.  | The perichordal mesoderm gives rise to the vertebrae and ribs. 脊索旁中胚层形成椎骨和肋骨。 | 近义词: paravertebral (部分情况下) | 反义词:  extrachordial


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a biological or anatomical context, so tense usage depends entirely on the sentence structure.  There is no inherent tense associated with the adjective itself.  Examples below illustrate usage within different sentence structures.


一般现在时:
The perichordal tissue is crucial for skeletal development. = 脊索旁组织对于骨骼发育至关重要。
Perichordal cells differentiate into various skeletal components. = 脊索旁细胞分化成各种骨骼成分。


一般过去时:
Scientists studied the perichordal region of the embryo. = 科学家研究了胚胎的脊索旁区域。
The perichordal sheath was observed under the microscope. = 在显微镜下观察到脊索旁鞘。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several genes involved in perichordal development. = 研究人员已经确定了几个参与脊索旁发育的基因。
Studies have shown the perichordal mesoderm's importance in vertebrate evolution. = 研究表明脊索旁中胚层在脊椎动物进化中的重要性。


过去完成时:
Before the formation of the vertebrae, the perichordal cells had already begun to differentiate. = 在椎骨形成之前，脊索旁细胞已经开始分化。
By the time the embryo reached a certain stage, the perichordal sheath had fully developed. = 当胚胎到达一定阶段时，脊索旁鞘已经完全发育。


将来时:
Further research will investigate the role of perichordal factors in disease. = 后续研究将调查脊索旁因素在疾病中的作用。
Scientists will continue to study the perichordal region of various species. = 科学家将继续研究各种物种的脊索旁区域。


虚拟语气:
If the perichordal development was disrupted, severe skeletal abnormalities could occur. = 如果脊索旁发育受到破坏，可能会出现严重的骨骼异常。
It is hypothesized that if the perichordal mesoderm was not present, vertebrae formation would be impossible. = 假设如果不存在脊索旁中胚层，椎骨的形成是不可能的。


被动语态:
The perichordal region was carefully dissected for analysis. = 脊索旁区域被仔细解剖以进行分析。
The perichordal cells were observed to migrate towards the notochord. = 观察到脊索旁细胞迁移到脊索。



疑问句:
Is the perichordal mesoderm involved in the formation of the intervertebral discs? = 脊索旁中胚层是否参与椎间盘的形成？
What are the specific molecular mechanisms governing perichordal development? = 控制脊索旁发育的具体分子机制是什么？


否定句:
The perichordal cells did not migrate in the absence of specific signaling molecules.  = 在没有特定信号分子的情况下，脊索旁细胞不会迁移。
The observed phenotype was not consistent with a disruption of perichordal development. = 观察到的表型与脊索旁发育的破坏不一致。


PHRASE->
There are limited common phrases directly using "perichordal" due to its specialized nature. The usage is primarily within scientific descriptions.  Examples would need to be constructed within a sentence context.  For instance:

perichordal cells: 脊索旁细胞
perichordal region: 脊索旁区域
perichordal mesoderm: 脊索旁中胚层
perichordal sheath: 脊索旁鞘
role of perichordal factors: 脊索旁因素的作用
