词源:

The phrase "in a nutshell" originates from the Aesop's fable, where the story of the world was written on a nutshell.  The implication is that even a complex idea can be summarized into a small space.  The modern usage extends to mean "in brief" or "in short".  "Inshell" is a less common, less formal, and more modern variation of the phrase, omitting "a".
