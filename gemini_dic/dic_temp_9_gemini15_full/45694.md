词源:
The word "curtsy" comes from the Old French word "courtoisie," meaning "courtesy," which in turn is derived from the Latin word "cortis," meaning "court."  The act of curtsying was originally a sign of respect and politeness shown in the courts of medieval Europe.  Over time, the meaning narrowed to specifically refer to the women's knee-bending bow.
