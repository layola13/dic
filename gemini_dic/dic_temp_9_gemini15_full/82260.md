Etymology:  The word "groundhog" is a compound word. "Ground" refers to its habitat, and "hog" is a somewhat informal term for a large, stout animal. The "hog" part likely comes from its size and appearance relative to other rodents.  The term "woodchuck" is an older and arguably more accurate name, reflecting its habitat in wooded areas.  Both terms ultimately derive from the animal's characteristics and habitat.
