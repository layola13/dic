词源:
The word "rot" comes from the Old English word *rotian, meaning "to rot, decay."  This, in turn, has roots in the Proto-Germanic word *rōtjan-, and ultimately connects to the Proto-Indo-European root *h₂rew-, meaning "to stir, mix."  The sense of decay likely evolved from the idea of things being stirred or mixed up and thus breaking down.
