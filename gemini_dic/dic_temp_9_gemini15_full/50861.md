词源:  The word "deselecting" is formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse") to the verb "selecting".  "Selecting" itself comes from the Latin word "selectus," the past participle of "selegere," meaning "to choose" or "to gather." Therefore, "deselecting" literally means "removing the selection" or "unchoosing."
