nonfreemen:/ˈnɑːnˈfriːmən/ | n. | 非自由民，奴隶，平民 |  People who are not freemen; those who lack the rights and privileges of freemen, often implying a state of servitude or subjugation.  This term is historically significant, reflecting social structures where freedom was not universal.  The specific meaning can vary depending on the historical context. | Example: In many ancient societies, nonfreemen constituted the majority of the population, working the land or serving in other capacities under the control of the elite.  在许多古代社会中，非自由民构成人口的大多数，在精英的控制下耕种土地或从事其他工作。


The term "nonfreemen" is a compound word formed by the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "freemen".  "Freemen" itself has a complex etymology, tracing back to Old English "frēoman" (free + man). "Free" derives from Proto-Germanic *frei- ("free, beloved, dear") and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *pri- ("to love, be dear").  Therefore, the word's roots signify those who are not beloved, cherished, or granted the rights and freedoms associated with citizenship.


The use of "nonfreemen" is primarily found in historical contexts, particularly when discussing social structures in ancient societies, medieval Europe, or colonial settings. Its meaning is largely defined by the contrast with "freemen," whose status implied certain rights and privileges, such as land ownership, political participation, or exemption from certain forms of labor.
