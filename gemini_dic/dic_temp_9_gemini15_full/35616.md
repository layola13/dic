词源:
The word "coastline" is a compound word.  "Coast" comes from the Old French "coste," meaning "side" or "rib," ultimately from the Latin "costa," with the same meaning.  "-line" is a common suffix indicating a boundary or a continuous extent.  Therefore, "coastline" literally means "the line of the coast."
