The word "nonmasculinenesses" is a relatively rare and complex word. It's a noun formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "masculinenesses," which is itself a plural noun.


Let's break down the word's etymology:


* **masculinity:** From Latin *masculus* ("male"), ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *mus- ("mouse," "male").  The suffix "-inity" creates abstract nouns denoting a quality or state.

* **non-:** A prefix of negation, derived from Latin *non*.

* **-nesses:** A plural suffix, indicating multiple instances of a quality or state.


Therefore, "nonmasculinenesses" refers to multiple instances of qualities or characteristics that are not associated with masculinity.  It is a very formal and somewhat unwieldy word, often used in academic or highly specialized contexts.  More common and less cumbersome alternatives usually exist.
