词源:
The word "sheepling" is a combination of "sheep" and the diminutive suffix "-ling," indicating something small or young.  Therefore, it literally means "young sheep" or "sheep's skin," specifically the skin of a young sheep.  The usage evolved to primarily refer to the skin itself and products made from it.
