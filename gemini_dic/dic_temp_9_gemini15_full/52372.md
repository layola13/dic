ETYMOLOGY->

The word "dictionary" ultimately derives from the Medieval Latin word *dictionarium*, which itself is derived from the Latin word *dictio*, meaning "diction," "speech," or "word."  The suffix "-arium" indicates a place or collection of something. Therefore, *dictionarium* literally meant "a collection of words" or "a book of words."  The word evolved through various forms in Old French and Middle English before arriving at its modern English form.
