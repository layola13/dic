词源:

The term is a compound phrase combining "pay" (from Old English *giefan, meaning "to give")  and "performance" (from Old French *performance, meaning "execution, accomplishment"). The "for" acts as a preposition indicating the basis of the payment.  The concept itself evolved with the growth of modern management theory and the increasing emphasis on measurable results.
