词源:
The word "initialization" is derived from the verb "initialize," which itself comes from the word "initial."  "Initial" ultimately originates from the Latin word "initium," meaning "beginning" or "start."  The suffix "-ization" indicates the process of making something initial or bringing it to its initial state.
