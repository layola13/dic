PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "redissected". The usage is primarily as a verb in the context of thorough re-analysis or re-dissection.  Phrases would be built around it, such as:

carefully redissected = 仔细地重新解剖/分析
thoroughly redissected = 彻底地重新解剖/分析
repeatedly redissected = 反复地重新解剖/分析
meticulously redissected = 细致地重新解剖/分析
fully redissected = 完全地重新解剖/分析


词源:

The word is formed by combining the prefix "re-" (meaning again) with the verb "dissected" (from the Latin "dissecāre," meaning "to cut apart").  Therefore, it literally means "to cut apart again."  The modern usage extends beyond the literal cutting to encompass thorough re-analysis.
