/ˌpriːsəˈfɪʃəntli/ | adj. |预先足够地；事先充分地 |  The term "presufficiently" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, a newly coined word, formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before) and "sufficiently" (meaning enough).  It attempts to convey the idea of something being sufficient *before* a certain point or event.  However, because it's not a recognized word, its usage is highly unconventional and should be avoided in formal writing or speech.  A more appropriate phrasing would be needed depending on the intended meaning. |  There are no standard examples because the word isn't in standard dictionaries.  One could *hypothetically* create a sentence like: "He presufficiently prepared his arguments, ensuring a smooth debate," but this is awkward and should be rewritten using clearer language.  For example: "He prepared his arguments thoroughly in advance, ensuring a smooth debate." | sufficiently, adequately, amply | insufficiently, inadequately | adj.
