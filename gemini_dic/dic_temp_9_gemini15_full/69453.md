词源:

feignedly derives from the verb "feign," which comes from the Old French word "feindre," meaning "to shape, fashion, form," ultimately from the Latin "fingere," with the same meaning.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective "feigned" into an adverb, indicating the manner in which an action is performed.
