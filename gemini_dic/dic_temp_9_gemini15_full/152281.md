词源:
The origin of "patsy" is uncertain, but it likely emerged in American English slang in the early 20th century.  Several theories exist, but none are definitively proven.  One popular theory links it to the Yiddish word "patshe," meaning "simpleton" or "fool." Another suggests a connection to "paste," implying someone easily stuck or manipulated.
