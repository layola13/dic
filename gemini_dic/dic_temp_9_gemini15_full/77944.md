USAGE->
This word is unusual and likely incorrect.  The correct word is "genomics", which is singular.  The plural would simply be "genomics".  Therefore, example sentences using "genomicses" are not possible.  The following examples use "genomics":


一般现在时:
Genomics reveals much about the human body. = 基因组学揭示了关于人体的大量信息。
Genomics is a rapidly advancing field. = 基因组学是一个快速发展的领域。


一般过去时:
Early genomics research focused on mapping genes. = 早期的基因组学研究集中在基因图谱绘制上。
The scientists presented their genomics findings. = 科学家们展示了他们的基因组学研究成果。


现在完成时:
Genomics has revolutionized medicine. = 基因组学彻底改变了医学。
Researchers have made significant breakthroughs in genomics. = 研究人员在基因组学方面取得了重大突破。


过去完成时:
Before the Human Genome Project, genomics was less developed. = 在人类基因组计划之前，基因组学发展水平较低。
