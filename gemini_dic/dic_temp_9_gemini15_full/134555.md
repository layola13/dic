/ˌnɒnˈlɪtərərɪlinəsɪz/ | n. | 非文学性；非文学特征的复数 | The word "nonliterarilynesses" is not a standard English word. It's a contrived formation, seemingly created by adding "-nesses" (a pluralizing suffix indicating qualities or states) to "nonliterarily" (itself an adverbial form meaning "in a non-literary manner").  Therefore, there is no established meaning, usage, synonyms, or antonyms. Its existence highlights the potential for creating extremely long and unwieldy words by combining existing morphemes.  The word is grammatically correct in its formation but semantically nonsensical in typical usage.  It would likely be understood only in the context of discussing word formation or unusual linguistic constructs. |  There are no standard examples as the word is not used.  The best way to illustrate its potential usage would be within a sentence analyzing linguistic creation: "The professor analyzed the unusual 'nonliterarilynesses' presented in the experimental poetry." |  N/A | N/A |  Noun (plural)
