词源:
The word "offensively" derives from the adjective "offensive," which comes from the Old French word "offensif," meaning "attacking, assaulting."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "offensus," the past participle of "offendere," meaning "to strike, to offend."  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner in which something is done.
