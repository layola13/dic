词源:
The word "noncoagulation" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "coagulation" (the process of changing from a liquid to a solid or semi-solid state).  "Coagulation" itself comes from the Latin word "coagulatio," a combination of "coagulare" (to curdle or thicken) and the suffix "-ation" (indicating a process or action).
