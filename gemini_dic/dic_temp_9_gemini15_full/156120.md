photostationary:/ˌfoʊtoʊˈsteɪʃənəri/ | adj. | 光化学稳定的；光稳定性的 |  Relating to or denoting a state in which the rate of formation of a chemical substance by a photochemical reaction equals its rate of destruction.  This typically applies to atmospheric pollutants. | Example:  The photostationary state of ozone in the troposphere is influenced by various factors.  = 对流层中臭氧的光化学稳定状态受多种因素影响。 | 近义词：photochemically stable | 反义词：photochemically unstable
