dioecism:/daɪˈiːsɪzəm/| n. |雌雄异株；雌雄异体|The condition in which the male and female reproductive organs are borne on separate individuals.  It is common in many plant and animal species.  Dioecism is an evolutionary strategy that promotes outcrossing and genetic diversity.| Example:  Many species of holly exhibit dioecism, with some plants producing only male flowers and others only female flowers.  许多冬青物种表现出雌雄异株，有些植物只产生雄花，另一些只产生雌花。|近义词：gynodioecy (雌雄异株，部分雌雄同株),  unisexuality (雌雄异体)|反义词：monoecy (雌雄同株), hermaphroditism (雌雄同体)

The plant exhibits dioecism. = 这植物是雌雄异株的。


一般过去时:
Scientists studied the dioecism of the plant. = 科学家研究了这种植物的雌雄异株特性。
The researchers discovered that dioecism was prevalent in that region. = 研究人员发现该地区普遍存在雌雄异株现象。


现在完成时:
Researchers have observed dioecism in various animal groups. = 研究人员已在各种动物群体中观察到雌雄异株现象。
