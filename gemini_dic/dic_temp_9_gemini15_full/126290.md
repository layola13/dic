Myofibrils are responsible for muscle contraction. = 肌原纤维负责肌肉收缩。


一般过去时:
The myocytes relaxed after the contraction. = 肌细胞在收缩后放松。
The biopsy showed damaged myofibers. = 活检显示肌纤维受损。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered new myokines. = 科学家们已经发现了新的肌动素。
Researchers have studied the effects of exercise on myocytes. = 研究人员已经研究了运动对肌细胞的影响。


过去完成时:
The patient had experienced myalgia before the diagnosis. = 患者在诊断前曾经历过肌痛。
The athlete had strained his myofibrils during the competition. = 运动员在比赛中拉伤了他的肌原纤维。


将来时:
They will investigate the role of myostatin in muscle growth. = 他们将研究肌生长抑制素在肌肉生长中的作用。
Researchers will analyze the myosin protein's structure. = 研究人员将分析肌球蛋白的结构。


虚拟语气:
If the myocardium were damaged, surgery would be necessary. = 如果心肌受损，则需要手术。
If the myofibrils were not functioning properly, muscle weakness would result. = 如果肌原纤维功能不正常，就会导致肌肉无力。


被动语态:

The myocardium is supplied with blood by the coronary arteries. = 心肌由冠状动脉供血。


疑问句:
What is the function of myoglobin in muscle tissue? = 肌红蛋白在肌肉组织中的功能是什么？
How are myofibrils organized within muscle cells? = 肌原纤维在肌细胞内是如何组织的？


否定句:
The muscle did not have enough myoglobin. = 这块肌肉没有足够的肌红蛋白。
The patient did not show signs of myopathy. = 病人没有表现出肌病的迹象。
