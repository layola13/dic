The word "forkednesses" is a relatively uncommon noun, formed from the adjective "forked" by adding the suffix "-nesses," which indicates a plural of qualities or states.  It refers to the multiple branches, divisions, or diverging paths of something.  Think of it as the plural of "forkedness," which itself isn't frequently used but implies the quality or state of being forked.

The word's root lies in the Old English "forc," meaning "fork."  The modern English word "fork" retains this meaning, referencing both the utensil and the branching shape.  The "-ed" suffix transforms the noun into an adjective describing something having this branching form.  Finally, "-nesses" creates the plural noun, emphasizing the multiplicity of these branching points or paths.

This word is primarily used in figurative contexts, describing complex or multifaceted situations with multiple possibilities or outcomes. It suggests a sense of uncertainty or choice among various options.  The word is not commonly used in everyday conversation and may sound overly formal or literary.
