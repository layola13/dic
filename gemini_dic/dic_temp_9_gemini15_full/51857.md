dextro:/ˈdɛkstrəʊ/| adj.|右旋的；右方的|Right-handed; deviating to the right.  It is used in chemistry to describe molecules that rotate plane-polarized light to the right (clockwise). In anatomy, it refers to the right side of the body.| 例句：The dextro isomer of lactic acid is found in sour milk.  右旋乳酸存在于酸奶中。| 例句：The dextro rotation of the solution indicated the presence of the specific compound. 溶液的右旋表明存在特定化合物。|近义词：dextrorotatory, right-handed|反义词：levo-, levorotatory, left-handed|


词源：From Latin *dexter, meaning "right hand".  The term reflects the historical association of right-handedness with clockwise rotation.

用法说明：

The word "dextro" is primarily used as a prefix in scientific contexts, particularly in chemistry and anatomy.  It indicates a right-handed or clockwise orientation.

化学:

In chemistry, dextro- (often abbreviated as D-) is used to designate enantiomers (mirror-image isomers) that rotate plane-polarized light to the right (clockwise). This is in contrast to levo- (L-), which indicates a counterclockwise rotation.  The designation doesn't necessarily correlate with the absolute configuration (R or S) of a molecule, although it often does.  The D/L system is based on the historical comparison to glyceraldehyde, a reference compound.

解剖学:

In anatomy, dextro- means "on or towards the right side".  For example, dextrocardia is a condition where the heart is located on the right side of the chest.

例句(化学):

The dextro form of glucose is the most common form found in nature.  葡萄糖的右旋形式是自然界中最常见的形式。


The dextro isomer of thalidomide was found to be the teratogenic one.  发现沙利度胺的右旋异构体是致畸的。


例句(解剖学):

The patient presented with dextrocardia and situs inversus. 病人出现右位心和内脏反位。


He experienced pain in his dextro lateral quadrant. 他右侧腹部疼痛。


词组:

There aren't common multi-word phrases using "dextro" in everyday language. Its usage is mostly confined to scientific terminology, often as a prefix.  Examples include:

* dextrocardia (右位心)
* dextrose (葡萄糖, a specific type of dextro-glucose)
* dextroamphetamine (右旋苯异丙胺)
* dextrorotatory (右旋的)
* dextrogyrate (右旋的)


注意：The term "dextro" should not be confused with "dexterous," which means skillful or adroit with one's hands.  While both words ultimately derive from the same Latin root, they have very different meanings and usages.
