词源:
The phrase "join hands" is a straightforward combination of the verb "join" and the noun "hands."  "Join" means to connect or unite, and "hands" refer to the physical appendages used for grasping and working.  The figurative meaning of working together evolved naturally from the literal meaning of physically holding hands.  The earliest recorded usage reflects this literal meaning,  with the figurative meaning developing over time.
