PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "nonconnotatively". The adverb modifies verbs describing communication or description.  Instead, examples illustrating the concept are provided:


* To explain something in a purely objective manner. = 以纯粹客观的方式解释某事。
* To state facts without emotional coloring. = 陈述事实而不带感情色彩。
* To use precise language devoid of implication. = 使用精确的语言，不含任何暗示。

词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") + "connotatively" (the adverbial form of "connotative," meaning "implying or suggesting (an idea or feeling) in addition to the literal or primary meaning").  Therefore, "nonconnotatively" means "in a way that does not imply or suggest anything beyond the literal meaning."
