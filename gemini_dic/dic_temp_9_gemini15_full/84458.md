halometer:/həˈlɒmɪtər/ | n. | 测卤器 | A halometer is a device used to measure the concentration of halogens, particularly halides, in a solution or sample.  It typically works by reacting the halides with a reagent to produce a measurable signal, such as a color change or a change in conductivity. | The technician used a halometer to determine the chloride content of the water sample.  | 近义词:halide meter,  ion-selective electrode (for specific halides) | 反义词:N/A


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The halometer measures the halide concentration accurately. = 测卤器精确地测量卤化物浓度。
This halometer displays the results digitally. = 这台测卤器以数字方式显示结果。


一般过去时:

现在完成时:
We have used this halometer for many years. = 我们已经使用这个测卤器多年了。
The lab has recently acquired a new halometer. = 实验室最近购置了一台新的测卤器。


过去完成时:
They had calibrated the halometer before starting the test. = 他们在开始测试之前已经校准了测卤器。
The results were inaccurate because the halometer had not been properly maintained. = 结果不准确，因为测卤器没有得到适当的维护。


将来时:
We will use a halometer to test the water quality. = 我们将使用测卤器来检测水质。
The lab will purchase a more advanced halometer next year. = 实验室明年将购买一台更先进的测卤器。


虚拟语气:
If we had a halometer, we could test the sample ourselves. = 如果我们有测卤器，我们可以自己测试样品。
I wish we had a more sensitive halometer for this analysis. = 我希望我们有一台更灵敏的测卤器来进行这项分析。


被动语态:
The sample was analyzed using a halometer. = 样品是用测卤器分析的。
The halometer is being calibrated by the technician. = 测卤器正在由技术人员进行校准。


疑问句:
What type of halometer is best for this application? = 对于这个应用来说，哪种类型的测卤器最好？
Does the halometer require any special reagents? = 测卤器需要任何特殊的试剂吗？


否定句:
The halometer did not provide accurate readings. = 测卤器没有提供准确的读数。
We do not have a halometer in our lab. = 我们的实验室没有测卤器。
