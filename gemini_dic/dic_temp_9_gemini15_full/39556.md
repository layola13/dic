词源：

The word "conscientious" comes from the Latin word "conscientia," meaning "knowledge with," "knowledge together," or "consciousness."  The prefix "con-" means "with" or "together," "scientia" means "knowledge," and the "-ous" suffix indicates an adjective. Therefore, it literally means "having knowledge with oneself," implying a strong sense of moral awareness and responsibility.
