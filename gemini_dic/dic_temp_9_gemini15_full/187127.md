RNA:/ˈɑːrɛneɪ/|/ˈɑːrˌɛneɪ/| n. |核糖核酸|Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a polymeric molecule essential in various biological roles in coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes.  It is a crucial component in protein synthesis and many other cellular processes. RNA differs from DNA in its structure and function, being single-stranded instead of double-stranded and using uracil instead of thymine.  | Example:  Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries genetic information from DNA to ribosomes for protein synthesis.|近义词：mRNA, tRNA, rRNA|反义词：DNA


USAGE->
This word is a noun and doesn't conjugate like verbs.  Therefore, typical verb tenses are not applicable.  Instead, we'll show examples of how RNA is used in different grammatical structures.
