The word "langued" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following your requested format.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word, like "longed," "language," or a word with a different spelling.  Please double-check the spelling.
* **It's a neologism or highly specialized term:** It might be a newly coined word, a technical term in a specific field, or a word from a dialect or archaic language.  If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it might be possible to determine its meaning.
* **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a name or place name.

To help me assist you, please provide more information about where you encountered this word.
