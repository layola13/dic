The word "preillumination" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the noun "illumination" (the action of lighting something up).  "Illumination" itself comes from the Latin word "illuminare," meaning "to light up."  Therefore, the word's etymology traces back to the Latin root signifying the act of lighting something.
