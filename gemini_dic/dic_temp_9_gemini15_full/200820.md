/slaɪˈdɒmɪtər/ | n. | 滑动计，滑动测微计 | A slidometer is an instrument used to measure the degree of slip or sliding friction between two surfaces.  It typically involves applying a known force to one surface while measuring the resulting displacement or movement of the other surface.  The measurement can then be used to calculate the coefficient of friction. | The engineer used a slidometer to test the friction coefficient of the new brake pads.  工程师用滑动测微计测试新刹车片的摩擦系数。 The researchers employed a slidometer to analyze the slippage between the tectonic plates. 研究人员用滑动测微计分析构造板块间的滑动情况。 |  None explicitly defined.  | None explicitly defined. | noun
