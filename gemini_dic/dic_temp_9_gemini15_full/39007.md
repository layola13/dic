From "confiscate" + "-able".  "Confiscate" ultimately derives from the Late Latin *confiscatus, the past participle of *confiscare, meaning "to seize into the treasury," from Latin fiscus ("treasury").


用法说明：


Confiscable is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that is subject to confiscation.  It emphasizes the legal possibility of seizure, rather than the act of seizure itself.  It is often used in legal contexts and discussions related to property, assets, or goods that may be taken away by authorities due to violations of laws or regulations.
