词源:
The word "circumstancing" is derived from the noun "circumstance," which comes from the Latin words "circum" (around) and "stans" (standing).  Therefore, it literally means "standing around" or "the things standing around" an event, which evolved to mean the facts and details surrounding an event.  The verb form "circumstancing" reflects the act of detailing these surrounding facts.
