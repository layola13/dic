refrangibility:/ˌrifrændʒəˈbɪləti/| n. | 折射性，折射力 | The ability of a substance to refract light.  This property is dependent on the wavelength of light and the refractive index of the substance. |  The refrangibility of glass allows it to bend light, creating a prism effect. 玻璃的折射性使其能够弯曲光线，产生棱镜效应。| 近义词：refractive power,  refraction | 反义词：None (Antonyms are not directly applicable; it's more about the degree of refrangibility) | 名词
