The word "gwindor" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and usage description cannot be provided.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?

2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name (person, place, or thing) specific to a certain context (e.g., a fictional character's name, a place name, a brand name).  More information is needed.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word or a slang term not yet widely accepted.  Again, context is crucial.

4. **It's from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language.  If you can provide the language of origin, it might be possible to translate and explain it.
