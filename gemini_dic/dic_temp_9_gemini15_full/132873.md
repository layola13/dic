USAGE->
This word is a relatively uncommon noun, and its usage is primarily in academic or technical writing where a detailed description of the absence of elaboration is required.  Therefore, providing examples across all tenses and moods is not practically useful.  The following examples illustrate its core meaning:


一般现在时:
The nonelaboratenesses in his explanation are frustrating. = 他解释中的不详尽之处令人沮丧。
The nonelaboratenesses of the design are evident. = 设计的不精细之处显而易见。


一般过去时:
The nonelaboratenesses of the previous report led to misunderstandings. = 之前的报告不够详尽，导致了误解。
The committee noted the nonelaboratenesses in the proposal. = 委员会注意到了提案中的不详尽之处。


现在完成时:
The numerous nonelaboratenesses in the document have hampered progress. = 文件中大量的细节缺失已经阻碍了进展。
Researchers have highlighted the nonelaboratenesses of existing theories. = 研究人员强调了现有理论的不完善之处。


PHRASE->
Because "nonelaboratenesses" is a relatively unusual word, common phrases using it are unlikely. The word itself functions as a descriptive term rather than a part of a common phrase.  Instead, it's more likely to be used with phrases like: "a number of...",  "instances of...", "the presence of...", etc.  For example:


a number of nonelaboratenesses in the data = 数据中的一些不详尽之处
the presence of several nonelaboratenesses in the argument = 论证中存在一些不详尽之处
instances of nonelaboratenesses throughout the manuscript = 手稿中到处都有不详尽之处


词源:

The word is formed by combining:

* **non-**: a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of"
* **elaborate**:  (verb) to develop or work out in detail; (adjective) involving many details; complicated
* **-ness**: a suffix forming nouns of state or quality

Therefore, "nonelaborateness" means "the state of not being elaborate," and "nonelaboratenesses" is its plural form.
