词源:

The word "miniskirt" is a compound word.  "Mini" is a shortened form of "miniature," meaning very small.  "Skirt" refers to a garment worn around the waist and hanging down.  Therefore, "miniskirt" literally means a very small skirt.  The word came into common usage in the mid-20th century, coinciding with the rise in popularity of the style.
