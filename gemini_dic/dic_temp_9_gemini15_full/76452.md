词源:  The word "gainsaying" comes from the Old English "gewinnsagian," composed of "gewinn" (gain, profit, strife) and "sagian" (to say).  The original meaning suggests speaking against or contesting something, particularly a gain or advantage. Over time, the "gewinn" element shifted semantically, leading to the modern sense of contradicting or denying.
