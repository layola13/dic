词源:

The word "predoubtful" is a relatively rare and informal combination of "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and "doubtful".  It suggests a doubt or uncertainty that exists *before* a situation is fully understood or resolved. There's no established etymology beyond this simple combination of existing elements.  Its usage is mainly colloquial.
