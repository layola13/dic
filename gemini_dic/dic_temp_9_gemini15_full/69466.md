词源:  The word "feisty" itself is of uncertain origin, but it's likely related to "fist," suggesting a readiness to fight or use physical force.  The "-ier" suffix adds a comparative sense, making it "more feisty."  The evolution likely involved a shift from a purely physical connotation to one that includes spiritedness and assertiveness.
