词源:

The word "intertrafficked" is a relatively modern coinage. It combines the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") with "trafficked," the past participle of "traffic," referring to the illegal trade of goods or people.  The "traffic" element itself comes from the Old French "trafique," meaning "trade" or "commerce," ultimately derived from the Arabic "tarīq," meaning "road" or "way."  Therefore, the word's roots suggest the movement of goods or people across routes, specifically in an illegal context.
