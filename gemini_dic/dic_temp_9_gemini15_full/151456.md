The word "paror" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* It's a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* It's a technical term or slang specific to a particular field or region.  If so, please provide context.
* It's a newly coined word or a proper noun.  Again, more context is needed.


Please provide more information so I can help you.
