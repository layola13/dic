词源:  The word "overorganizing" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "organizing" (from "organize," ultimately derived from the French word "organiser," itself from the Greek word "organon" meaning "tool" or "instrument").  Therefore, overorganizing means organizing to an excessive degree.
