词源:
The word "meddle" comes from the Middle English word "meddlen," which means "to mix," "to interfere," or "to be busy with."  This, in turn, is related to the Old English word "maþel," meaning "speech," "counsel," or "conference," suggesting an element of busy interference in discussions or affairs.
