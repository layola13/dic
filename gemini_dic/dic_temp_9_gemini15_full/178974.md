词源:
The word "redeem" comes from the Old English word "rīdeman," meaning "to buy back, ransom."  This ultimately derives from the Proto-Germanic *rauzōjaną, meaning "to buy back, ransom." The meaning has evolved over time to include the broader sense of atoning for faults, fulfilling obligations, and saving from sin or danger.
