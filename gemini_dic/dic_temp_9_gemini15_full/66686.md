exogenism:/ɪkˈsɒdʒənɪzəm/ | n. | 外成说；外生作用 | The theory that the Earth's features, such as mountains and valleys, were formed by external forces, such as erosion and deposition.  Exogenism is a geological concept that contrasts with endogenism, which attributes geological formations to internal forces like volcanism and tectonic activity. | Example: The Grand Canyon is a prime example of the power of exogenism in shaping the Earth's surface.  大峡谷是外成作用塑造地球表面的一个主要例子。  The study of exogenism helps us understand how landscapes evolve over time. 外成作用的研究有助于我们了解景观如何随着时间推移而演变。|近义词：external processes, surface processes |反义词：endogenism
