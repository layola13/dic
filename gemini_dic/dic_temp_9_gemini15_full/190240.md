The word "saponul" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of another word.  If you could provide context (where you encountered this word), it might be possible to guess the intended word.

2. **It's a neologism or technical term:** It could be a newly coined word, a word specific to a particular field, or a word from a different language.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a brand name, a place name, or a person's name.

Without further information, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  Please provide the context in which you encountered "saponul."
