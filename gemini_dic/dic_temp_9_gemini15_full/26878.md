词源:  The word "cakelet" is a diminutive of "cake," formed by adding the suffix "-let," which indicates smallness or diminutiveness.  This suffix is common in English, appearing in words like "booklet," "piglet," and "leaflet."  The word's origin therefore traces directly back to the Old English word "cāca," meaning "cake."
