shakudo:/ʃəˈkuːdoʊ/| n. | 舍库镀(一种日本金工技法)| Shakudo is a Japanese alloy of gold and copper, typically containing 4% to 10% gold,  used in metalwork.  Its dark, almost black, color is achieved through a patination process involving heat and chemical treatments. The resulting surface is then often inlaid with other metals like silver or gold to create intricate designs.  This technique is highly valued for its rich visual depth and exquisite craftsmanship.|  The tsuba (handguard) of this samurai sword is made of shakudo, intricately inlaid with silver. 这把武士刀的护手是用舍库镀制成的，上面精细地镶嵌着银子。| 近义词:  blackened copper, patinated copper | 反义词:  None specifically, but the opposite would be bright, unpatinated metal.
