carpospore:/ˈkɑːrpəˌspɔːr/| n. |果孢子|A carpospore is a spore produced by a red alga or other algae after fertilization. It is typically diploid (having two sets of chromosomes) and develops into a diploid sporophyte.  |Example: The carpospores of this seaweed species are released into the water column and dispersed by currents.  这个海藻物种的果孢子被释放到水柱中，并被洋流分散。|近义词：tetraspore (in some contexts)|反义词：gamete (in terms of ploidy)|名词

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The carpospore develops into a sporophyte. = 果孢子发育成为孢子体。
This alga produces many carpospores. =  这种藻类产生许多果孢子。


一般过去时:
The carpospore germinated quickly. = 果孢子迅速萌发。
Scientists observed the carpospore's development. = 科学家观察了果孢子的发育。


现在完成时:
The carpospore has already germinated. = 果孢子已经萌发了。
Researchers have studied the carpospore's genetics. = 研究人员已经研究了果孢子的遗传学。


过去完成时:
The carpospore had already been released before the tide changed. = 在潮水变化之前，果孢子已经被释放了。
The experiment had shown the carpospore's viability. = 实验已经显示了果孢子的活力。


将来时:
The carpospore will develop into a new plant. = 果孢子将发育成新的植物。
We will analyze the carpospore under a microscope. = 我们将在显微镜下分析果孢子。


虚拟语气:
If the carpospore were viable, it would germinate. = 如果果孢子有活力，它就会萌发。
I wish I had observed the release of the carpospore. = 我真希望我观察到了果孢子的释放。


被动语态:
The carpospore was dispersed by the current. = 果孢子被洋流分散。
The carpospore's development is being studied. = 果孢子的发育正在被研究。


疑问句:
What is the size of the carpospore? = 果孢子的大小是多少？
How many carpospores were released? = 释放了多少果孢子？


否定句:
The carpospore did not germinate. = 果孢子没有萌发。
The experiment did not show significant carpospore production. = 实验没有显示出明显的果孢子产量。


PHRASE->
carpospore production: 果孢子产量
carpospore germination: 果孢子萌发
carpospore dispersal: 果孢子散布
carpospore morphology: 果孢子形态
carpospore viability: 果孢子活力
