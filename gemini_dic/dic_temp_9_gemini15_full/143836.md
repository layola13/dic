词源:
The word "outperforms" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "surpassing" or "exceeding") and the verb "performs" (meaning "to carry out an action or function").  The "-s" indicates the third-person singular present tense.  It's a relatively modern word, formed through the natural process of word creation in English.
