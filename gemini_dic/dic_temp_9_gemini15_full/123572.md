词源:
The word "monstrous" ultimately derives from the Latin word "monstrum," meaning "omen," "marvel," or "prodigy."  In ancient Rome, a "monstrum" could refer to a birth defect, a bizarre natural phenomenon, or an event considered a sign from the gods. Over time, the meaning shifted to emphasize the frightening or abnormal aspects, leading to the modern sense of "huge" and "terrible."  The word entered English through Old French.
