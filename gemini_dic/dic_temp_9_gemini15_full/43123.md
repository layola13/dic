Etymology:  The word "coy" comes from the Middle Dutch word "koi" meaning "carefully watching, observant; cautious; sly", which itself is likely related to Middle Dutch "koyen" meaning "to look, peer; peep". This ultimately derives from Proto-Germanic *kaujan, meaning "to see, look". The sense shifted over time from simply meaning "observant" to implying a playful or affected shyness.  The superlative "-est" is a standard English suffix.
