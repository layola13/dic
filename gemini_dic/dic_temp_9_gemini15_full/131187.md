/nɑnˈbʌdɪŋz/ | n. | 非出芽的；不出芽的 |  The term "nonbuddings" describes organisms or cells that do not produce buds.  It's primarily used in biological contexts, particularly when discussing cellular reproduction or plant growth.  The word is the opposite of "budding," which refers to a form of asexual reproduction where a new organism develops from an outgrowth or bud due to cell division at one particular site.  Nonbudding organisms reproduce through other methods like binary fission or spore formation. | 例句：In this study, we compared the growth rates of budding yeast and nonbuddings.  在这个研究中，我们比较了出芽酵母和不出芽生物的生长速度。  The nonbudding cells were observed to undergo binary fission instead.  观察到不出芽细胞是通过二元分裂进行繁殖的。 | 近义词：non-budding, non-proliferating (in some contexts) | 反义词：budding, proliferating

疑问句:
Are these cells nonbuddings or are they simply dormant? = 这些细胞是不出芽的还是仅仅是休眠的？
What are the distinguishing characteristics of nonbuddings compared to their budding counterparts? = 与它们的出芽对应物相比，不出芽生物的区别特征是什么？


否定句:
