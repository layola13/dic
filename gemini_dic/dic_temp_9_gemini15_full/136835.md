nonsilicates:/ˌnɒnˈsɪlɪkeɪts/ | n. |非硅酸盐矿物|Nonsilicates are minerals that do not contain silicon and oxygen as the primary components of their chemical structure.  They are a diverse group encompassing various chemical compositions and crystal structures.  Examples include carbonates, sulfates, oxides, and halides.|The study of nonsilicates is crucial for understanding the geological processes that form various rock types and mineral deposits.|近义词：non-siliceous minerals |反义词：silicates
