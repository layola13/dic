词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "almost," or "like."  This prefix indicates a resemblance or approximation to something.

* **offensive**: From Old French *offensif*, ultimately from Latin *offendere*, meaning "to strike against," "to attack," or "to offend."


用法说明:

"Quasi-offensive" describes something that has some elements of offense but doesn't fully qualify as genuinely offensive.  It suggests a subtle or indirect nature of the offense, often leaving room for interpretation.  The context is crucial in understanding whether something is truly "quasi-offensive" or simply inappropriate.  The word implies a degree of ambiguity or uncertainty about the level of offense caused.
