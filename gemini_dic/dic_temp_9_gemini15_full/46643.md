The word "damner" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word, such as "damned" or "damning."  If you can provide context, I can help determine the intended word.

2. **It's slang or dialect:** It could be a very informal word or a word specific to a particular region or community.  Again, context is needed.

3. **It's a neologism:** It might be a newly coined word not yet widely accepted.

4. **It's a foreign word:** It could be a word from another language.
