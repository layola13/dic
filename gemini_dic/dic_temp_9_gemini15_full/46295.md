USAGE->
This word is an interjection and doesn't have verb conjugations or grammatical tenses like nouns or verbs do.  It's used as a standalone expression.

PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases built directly *with* "d'oh," as it's used independently to express a feeling.  However, it's often used in conjunction with other phrases to emphasize the feeling of annoyance or regret. For example:

"D'oh! I should have known better."  啊，哎呀！我本应该知道的。
"D'oh! That was a stupid mistake." 啊，哎呀！那真是个愚蠢的错误。
