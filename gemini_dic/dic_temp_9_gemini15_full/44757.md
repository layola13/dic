词源:

The word "crumbly" derives from the noun "crumb," meaning a small piece of bread or other food.  "Crumb" itself originates from the Old English word "crymb," ultimately related to the Proto-Germanic "*krummaz," meaning "crumb" or "fragment." The suffix "-ly" is an adverbial suffix, transforming the noun "crumb" into an adjective describing something having the quality of crumbs.
