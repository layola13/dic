colliquament:/ˈkɒlɪkwəmənt/| n. |液化物；胚胎发育初期液体|A colliquament is the liquid substance formed in the early stages of embryonic development.  It's essentially the primordial fluid from which the embryo develops. The term is now largely archaic and primarily used in historical or biological contexts related to early embryology.|The chicken egg's colliquament provided the initial environment for the development of the chick.|近义词：embryonic fluid, primordial fluid|反义词：solid, formed structure|名词
