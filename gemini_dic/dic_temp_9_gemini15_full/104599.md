The word "kany" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  Please double-check your spelling.
* **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name (person, place, or thing) or a brand name.  More context is needed.
* **It's slang or jargon:**  It could be a word used within a specific community or context.  If you can provide the context where you encountered it, I might be able to help.
* **It's a newly coined word:**  It's possible it's a very recent addition to the lexicon.
