词源:
The word "poll" comes from the Middle English "polle," meaning "head," which in turn is from Old French "pole," meaning "head, top, summit."  The sense of "to vote" developed from the practice of recording votes by marking a tally against someone's name, hence the "head" or person being counted.  The sense of a survey of opinions developed later.
