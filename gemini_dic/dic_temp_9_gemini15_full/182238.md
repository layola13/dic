词源:  The word is a combination of "re-" (again) and "mortgaging" (the act of using a property as collateral for a loan).  "Mortgage" itself comes from Old French *mort gage*, literally meaning "dead pledge," referring to the fact that the property is essentially "dead" to the owner until the loan is repaid.
