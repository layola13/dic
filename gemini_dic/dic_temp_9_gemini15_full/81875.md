词源:  The word "grievance" comes from the Old French word "grevance," meaning "burden, grievance," which in turn derives from the verb "grever," meaning "to burden, weigh down."  This ultimately connects to the Germanic root *graban, meaning "to dig, grave," suggesting the idea of something heavy weighing down or digging into one's spirit.
