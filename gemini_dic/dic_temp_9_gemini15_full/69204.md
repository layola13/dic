The word "feal" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "feel," "fealty," or "deal."
2. **It's a dialect word:** It might be a word from a regional dialect or archaic English.
3. **It's a neologism:** It could be a newly coined word not yet widely used.
4. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name or place name.


If you could provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
