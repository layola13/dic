nomography:/nəˈmɒɡrəfi/ | n. |诺模图法，列线图法 |The graphical representation of mathematical relationships by means of lines on a chart, enabling easy calculation of results.  Nomography is a visual method for solving equations. It uses aligned scales to represent variables, allowing for quick determination of solutions without complex calculations. | Example:  Nomography was used extensively in engineering and science before the advent of computers.  诺模图法在计算机出现之前广泛应用于工程和科学领域。 | 近义词：graphical calculation, alignment chart method | 反义词：None directly applicable.
