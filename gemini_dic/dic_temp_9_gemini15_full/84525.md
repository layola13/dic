Etymology:

The word "hame" comes from Old English *hama, meaning "covering," "wrapper," or "collar."  This ultimately derives from Proto-Germanic *hamō, with cognates found in other Germanic languages (e.g., Old High German hama, Old Norse hami). The original meaning evolved to specifically refer to the curved piece of a horse's harness due to its shape and function of covering and supporting the neck and shoulders.
