The word "prealleges" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word not yet widely accepted.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response,  I need a correctly spelled word.  If you can provide the intended word, I will gladly analyze it for you.
