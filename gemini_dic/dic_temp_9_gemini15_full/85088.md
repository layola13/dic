词源:  The word "hardballed" is a relatively recent addition to the English lexicon, likely arising as a figurative extension of the term "hardball," which itself refers to a forceful, aggressive style of play in baseball, characterized by strategic choices often at the expense of fair play. The "-ed" suffix transforms the noun "hardball" into an adjective, describing something characterized by this aggressive and uncompromising style.  The exact origin and date of its first usage are difficult to pinpoint without extensive corpus research.
