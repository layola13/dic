functors:/ˈfʌŋktərz/| n. |函子；泛函|In computer science, a functor is a type of higher-order function that maps one category to another, preserving the structure of the underlying categories.  In mathematics, a functor is a mapping between categories that preserves composition and identity morphisms.  It's a crucial concept in category theory. |Example: In functional programming, a functor allows you to apply a function to each element of a data structure without changing the structure itself.  For instance, you can map a function that squares each number in a list using a functor.  |近义词:mapper,transformer|反义词:|词性:n.


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the context of computer science and mathematics, so typical verb conjugations don't apply in the same way as with common English verbs.  The usage below shows how "functor" is used in descriptions and explanations rather than as an active verb.

Example 1 (Computer Science):  "The `map` function is a functor in many functional programming languages." = 在许多函数式编程语言中，`map` 函数是一个函子。

Example 2 (Mathematics): "A functor is a morphism between categories." = 函子是范畴之间的态射。

PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "functor".  The term is used within technical discussions and definitions.  Examples related to its application include:

Functor application:  Refers to the act of using a functor to transform data.
Functor composition: Combining multiple functors to achieve a more complex transformation.
Monadic functor:  A specific type of functor with additional properties (related to monads).
Applicative functor: Another specific type of functor that allows for applying functions to multiple values simultaneously.
Contravariant functor: A functor that reverses the direction of arrows in the category.
