词源:
The word "indebtedness" comes from the Old French word "endetté," meaning "in debt."  It combines the prefix "in-" (meaning "in" or "into") with "debt," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "debitum," meaning "something owed."  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "indebted" into a noun, signifying the state or condition of being indebted.
