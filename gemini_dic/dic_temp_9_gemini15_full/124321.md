词源:

The word "motherliness" is derived from the word "mother," ultimately from the Proto-Germanic *mōdēr, meaning "mother." The suffix "-liness" is a noun suffix that indicates a quality or characteristic, similar to suffixes like "-ness" (as in "goodness") or "-ship" (as in "friendship").  Therefore, "motherliness" denotes the quality or state of being like a mother.
