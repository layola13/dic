词源:  The word "determinacy" is derived from the Latin word "determinare," meaning "to bound, limit, or define."  The prefix "de-" means "completely," and "terminare" comes from "terminus," meaning "boundary" or "end."  Therefore, the root meaning points to the act of setting clear limits or boundaries, leading to a fixed and unambiguous outcome.
