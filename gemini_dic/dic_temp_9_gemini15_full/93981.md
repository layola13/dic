impactites:/ˈɪmpæktaɪts/| n. |冲击岩，撞击岩|Rocks formed by the impact of a meteorite or other celestial body.  These rocks are often characterized by the presence of shock-metamorphosed minerals and textures.  Impactites can provide valuable information about the impact event itself and the target rocks.|Example: The researchers discovered impactites at the crater site, confirming the impact event.|近义词: impact melt rocks, suevites|反义词: N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Impactites are formed by high-velocity impacts. = 冲击岩是由高速撞击形成的。
Scientists study impactites to understand past impacts. = 科学家研究冲击岩以了解过去的撞击事件。

一般过去时:
Researchers found impactites near the crater. = 研究人员在陨石坑附近发现了冲击岩。
The impact created a large field of impactites. = 撞击产生了一大片冲击岩。

现在完成时:
Geologists have identified several types of impactites. = 地质学家已经确定了几种类型的冲击岩。
Scientists have learned much from studying impactites. = 科学家们从研究冲击岩中学到了很多东西。

过去完成时:
Before the analysis, the team hadn't examined many impactites. = 在分析之前，研究小组没有检查过许多冲击岩。
The impact had already formed the impactites before the researchers arrived. = 在研究人员到达之前，撞击已经形成了冲击岩。

将来时:
Future studies will analyze more impactites from this crater. = 未来的研究将分析来自这个陨石坑的更多冲击岩。
Scientists will use advanced techniques to study the impactites. = 科学家将使用先进的技术来研究冲击岩。

虚拟语气:
If we had more impactites, we could conduct more detailed research. = 如果我们有更多的冲击岩，我们可以进行更详细的研究。
I wish we could easily identify all the impactites in the area. = 我希望我们可以很容易地识别该地区的所有冲击岩。

被动语态:
Impactites are often studied using microscopic techniques. = 冲击岩通常使用显微技术进行研究。
The impactites were analyzed for their mineral composition. = 对冲击岩进行了矿物成分分析。

疑问句:
What types of minerals are found in these impactites? = 这些冲击岩中发现了哪些类型的矿物？
Where were these impactites discovered? = 这些冲击岩是在哪里发现的？

否定句:
These rocks are not impactites; they are of volcanic origin. = 这些岩石不是冲击岩；它们是火山起源的。
The researchers did not initially identify the samples as impactites. = 研究人员最初没有将样本识别为冲击岩。


PHRASE->
impact crater impactites= 陨石坑冲击岩
shocked impactites = 冲击变质冲击岩
polymict impactites = 多成份冲击岩
melt impactites = 熔融冲击岩
suevite impactites = 苏维岩冲击岩
