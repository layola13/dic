词源:
The word "instill" comes from the Old French "instiller," which itself derives from the Latin "instillare."  "In-" means "in," and "stillare" means "to drop," referring to the act of dropping liquid into something.  The figurative meaning of gradually implanting an idea or feeling developed later.
