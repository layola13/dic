词源:  The word "perky" likely originates from the now-obsolete word "perk," meaning "to lift or raise."  This sense of "perk" is related to the Middle English word "perken," meaning "to strut,"  "to adorn oneself," or "to trim." The adjective "perky" then evolved to describe something that is raised or lifted, thus conveying a sense of cheerfulness and energy.  The association with alertness and liveliness likely stemmed from the visual image of something held up high, suggesting alertness and energy.
