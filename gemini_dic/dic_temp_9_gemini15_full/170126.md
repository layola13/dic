词源:  The word is a back-formation from "protocol," which itself comes from the Greek words "protos" (first) and "kolla" (glue), originally referring to the first page or initial notes glued to a document. The verb "protocolize" emerged as a technical term in fields where detailed record-keeping is crucial, such as scientific research and legal proceedings.
