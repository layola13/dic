neutron-radiation weapons: /ˈnjuːtrɒnˌreɪdieɪʃən ˈwɛpənz/ | n. | 中子辐射武器 | Neutron-radiation weapons are weapons that use nuclear fission or fusion to generate a burst of neutrons, causing widespread damage and casualties through radiation sickness and other effects. These weapons are distinct from typical nuclear weapons, which primarily rely on blast and thermal effects.  | Example: The potential use of neutron-radiation weapons has raised serious ethical concerns among international organizations. 中子辐射武器的潜在使用已引起国际组织的严重伦理担忧。| 近义词:  neutron bomb (although this term is somewhat outdated and less precise) | 反义词: conventional weapons, non-nuclear weapons |  名词

词源:
* **neutron:** From "neutral" (electrically neutral) + "-on," a suffix used to form nouns for particles.  The term was coined in the early 20th century.
* **radiation:** From Latin "radiatus," past participle of "radiare" (to shine, radiate).
* **weapons:** From Old English "wapen," meaning "weapon."
