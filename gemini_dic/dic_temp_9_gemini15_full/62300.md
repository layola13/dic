词源:
The word "endanger" comes from the Old French "endamager," which means "to damage."  The prefix "en-" intensifies the meaning, and "-danger" is derived from the Old French "dangier," meaning "power, control, domination," ultimately related to the Latin "dominium" (dominion). Therefore, "endanger" originally meant to bring under the power of harm or damage.
