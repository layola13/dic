词源:
The word "outthwack" is a relatively rare and informal word, formed by combining the prefix "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent than") with the verb "thwack" (meaning "to hit hard").  It's a playful and emphatic way of saying "to defeat decisively."  It doesn't have a long and established etymology like many older words.
