词源:
The word "convincer" is derived from the verb "convince," which comes from the Old French word "conveincre," ultimately from the Latin word "convincere," meaning "to overcome," "to conquer," or "to prove wrong."  The suffix "-er" is an agent noun suffix, indicating a person or thing that performs the action of the verb.
