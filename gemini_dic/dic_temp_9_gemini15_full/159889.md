polymorphically:/ˌpɒliˈmɔːrfɪkli/ | adv. | 多态地，多形地 |  Describes something that exhibits polymorphism, meaning it can take on many forms or have multiple implementations.  It is frequently used in the context of programming and object-oriented programming (OOP). | Example:  The function operates polymorphically, handling different data types seamlessly.  这个函数多态地运行，无缝处理不同数据类型。|近义词:  adaptively, variably | 反义词:monomorphically


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The program runs polymorphically. = 程序多态地运行。
The system handles data polymorphically. = 系统多态地处理数据。


一般过去时:
The method operated polymorphically. = 该方法多态地运行。
The function processed the input polymorphically. = 该函数多态地处理输入。


现在完成时:
The software has handled various data types polymorphically. = 该软件已经多态地处理了各种数据类型。
The framework has demonstrated polymorphic behavior. = 该框架已经展示了多态行为。


过去完成时:
The system had already processed the data polymorphically before the error occurred. = 在错误发生之前，系统已经多态地处理了数据。
The program had been running polymorphically until the unexpected input. = 直到出现意外输入，程序一直多态地运行。


将来时:
The application will handle different file formats polymorphically. = 该应用程序将多态地处理不同的文件格式。
The new update will allow the system to operate polymorphically. = 新更新将允许系统多态地运行。


虚拟语气:
If the function were implemented polymorphically, it would be more flexible. = 如果该函数以多态方式实现，它将更灵活。
I wish the library had been designed polymorphically from the start. = 我希望该库从一开始就以多态方式设计。


被动语态:
Different data types are handled polymorphically by the function. = 不同的数据类型由函数多态地处理。
Polymorphic behavior is exhibited by the object-oriented system. = 面向对象系统表现出多态行为。


疑问句:
Does this function operate polymorphically? = 这个函数是否多态地运行？
Is the system designed to handle data polymorphically? = 系统是否设计成多态地处理数据？


否定句:
The code does not handle exceptions polymorphically. = 该代码没有多态地处理异常。
The older version of the software did not operate polymorphically. = 该软件的旧版本没有多态地运行。


PHRASE->
polymorphically typed  多态类型
polymorphically dispatched 多态分派
polymorphically implemented 多态实现
polymorphically designed 多态设计
polymorphically extensible 多态可扩展
