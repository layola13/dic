self-differentiations:/ˌsɛlfˌdɪfərɛnʃiˈeɪʃənz/ | n. | 自我分化；自身差异化 | The process by which a relatively homogeneous group of cells or organisms develops into distinct types with specialized functions.  This is a key concept in developmental biology, where it describes how cells become specialized during embryonic development.  It also applies to other fields, such as sociology and organizational theory, where it describes the process of individuals or groups developing distinct identities and roles. | 例句：The self-differentiations of cells in the early embryo are crucial for the formation of organs and tissues. = 早期胚胎中细胞的自我分化对于器官和组织的形成至关重要。


The self-differentiations within the company led to the creation of specialized departments. = 公司内部的自我分化导致了专门部门的创建。| 近义词：specialization, diversification, differentiation | 反义词：homogenization, uniformity
