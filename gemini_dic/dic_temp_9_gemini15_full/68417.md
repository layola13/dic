falsifiability:/ˌfɔːlsɪfaɪəˈbɪləti/ | n. |可证伪性，可反驳性 |The quality or property of being capable of being disproven or refuted.  A theory or hypothesis is falsifiable if it is possible to conceive of an observation or experiment that would disprove it.  This is a key concept in the philosophy of science, particularly in Karl Popper's work. |Example:  Einstein's theory of relativity is falsifiable because it makes specific predictions that could be shown to be false through observation.  爱因斯坦的相对论是可证伪的，因为它做出了可以通过观测被证明是错误的具体预测。


Example: The hypothesis that "all swans are white" is falsifiable because observing a single black swan would disprove it.  假设“所有天鹅都是白色的”是可证伪的，因为观察到一只黑天鹅就会证伪它。|近义词：refutability, testability |反义词：unfalsifiability, unverifiability |词性:n.
