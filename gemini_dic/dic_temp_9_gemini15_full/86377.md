The word "hederal" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word, such as "federal," "hedral," or another word entirely.  Please double-check the spelling.
* **It's a neologism or technical term:** It might be a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field.  If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it might be possible to determine its meaning.
* **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a proper noun (name of a person, place, or thing), in which case a dictionary would not necessarily list it.


If you can provide more information or correct the spelling, I can gladly provide the analysis as requested.
