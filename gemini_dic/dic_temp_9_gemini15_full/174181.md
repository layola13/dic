queer:/kwɪər/| adj., n., pron.|奇怪的；古怪的；同性恋的|

英文解析:As an adjective, "queer" means strange, odd, or unusual.  As a noun, it refers to a person who identifies as LGBTQ+.  Its use as a noun is a reclaimed term, and while it's generally acceptable within the LGBTQ+ community, it can still be offensive depending on context and tone.  The adjective usage is becoming less common in informal settings due to its historical use as a slur.
