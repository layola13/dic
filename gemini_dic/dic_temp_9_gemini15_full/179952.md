referent:/ˈrɛfərənt/| n. |所指;指称对象;参照物|The word "dog" is a linguistic sign, and a particular dog is its referent.  单词“狗”是一个语言符号，而一只具体的狗就是它的所指。|近义词：object, denotation |反义词：N/A


The referent is the thing that a word, phrase, or sentence refers to.  It is the actual entity or concept in the real world (or a fictional world) that a linguistic expression points to.  For example, in the sentence "The cat sat on the mat," the referent of "cat" is the specific feline that is sitting on the mat, and the referent of "mat" is the specific piece of floor covering.  The referent can be concrete (a physical object) or abstract (an idea, concept, or feeling).  Determining the referent can sometimes be ambiguous, depending on the context.

例句：

The referent of "the president" can change depending on the country being discussed.  “总统”的所指对象会根据所讨论的国家而改变。

His painting’s referent was a moment of intense personal grief.  他的画作的所指对象是他经历过的一段刻骨铭心的悲伤时刻。
