phosphoryl:/ˈfɒsfərɪl/ | n. | 磷酰基 | A group of atoms derived from phosphoric acid by removing two hydroxyl groups (-OH) and leaving a =O group and two bonds available for attachment to other atoms or groups.  It is often represented as PO3. | Example: Phosphoryl groups are crucial in cellular signaling processes. 磷酰基在细胞信号传导过程中至关重要。|近义词：phospho;  |反义词：N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The phosphoryl group transfers energy. = 磷酰基转移能量。
Phosphoryl groups modify proteins. = 磷酰基修饰蛋白质。


一般过去时:

Researchers identified a new phosphoryl group. = 研究人员发现了一个新的磷酰基。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied phosphoryl transfer for decades. = 科学家们几十年来一直在研究磷酰基转移。
The cell has utilized phosphoryl groups for energy. = 细胞已利用磷酰基来获取能量。


过去完成时:
The reaction had already transferred the phosphoryl group before observation. = 在观察之前，反应已经转移了磷酰基。
They had discovered the importance of phosphoryl groups earlier. = 他们较早地发现了磷酰基的重要性。


将来时:
Researchers will investigate the role of phosphoryl groups in disease. = 研究人员将调查磷酰基在疾病中的作用。
The experiment will demonstrate phosphoryl group transfer. = 实验将演示磷酰基转移。


虚拟语气:
If the phosphoryl group were removed, the protein would be inactive. = 如果磷酰基被去除，蛋白质就会失活。
It is important that the phosphoryl group binds correctly. = 磷酰基正确结合很重要。


被动语态:
The protein was phosphorylated by the kinase. = 蛋白质被激酶磷酸化。
The phosphoryl group was transferred efficiently. = 磷酰基被有效地转移。


疑问句:
What is the role of the phosphoryl group in this reaction? = 在这个反应中，磷酰基的作用是什么？
How does the phosphoryl group affect protein function? = 磷酰基如何影响蛋白质的功能？


否定句:
The protein was not phosphorylated. = 蛋白质没有被磷酸化。
The reaction did not involve a phosphoryl group transfer. = 该反应不涉及磷酰基转移。


PHRASE->
phosphoryl group = 磷酰基
phosphoryl transfer = 磷酰基转移
phosphoryl chloride = 磷酰氯
phosphorylcholine = 磷酰胆碱
phosphorylated protein = 磷酸化蛋白
