词源:
The word "mushroom" ultimately derives from the Old French *muscheron,  a diminutive of *musc, meaning "fly," possibly referring to the flies attracted to certain fungi.  The connection is somewhat tenuous and the exact etymology is debated.  The word evolved through Middle English and into its modern form.
