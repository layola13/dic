The wire is a noninsulator, so be careful. = 这根电线是非绝缘体，所以小心点。
This material is a poor noninsulator, offering little resistance to current flow. =  这种材料是劣质的非绝缘体，对电流的阻力很小。


否定句:
That wire is not a noninsulator; it's actually a very good insulator. = 那根电线不是非绝缘体；它实际上是很好的绝缘体。
This component isn't a noninsulator; it's designed to prevent current leakage. = 这个组件不是非绝缘体；它是用来防止电流泄漏的。


疑问句:
Is the casing a noninsulator? = 外壳是非绝缘体吗？
Are these wires noninsulators or insulators? = 这些电线是非绝缘体还是绝缘体？
