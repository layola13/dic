This request is impossible to fulfill completely as "noninfinitives" is not a word in standard English.  There is no single word with that spelling and meaning. It seems to be a neologism or a misspelling.  To provide an analysis as requested, one would need to know what the intended meaning is.

If the intention was to refer to non-infinitive verb forms, then the analysis would cover all verb forms *except* infinitives (to + verb). This would include:

* **Present participles (gerunds):**  -ing forms used as nouns or adjectives.
* **Past participles:** -ed (or irregular equivalent) forms often used as adjectives or in perfect verb tenses.
* **Base forms:** The uninflected form of the verb, often used in simple present tense.


It is impossible to present an analysis following the requested format for a term that doesn't exist. To provide a helpful response, please clarify the intended meaning or provide the correct word.
