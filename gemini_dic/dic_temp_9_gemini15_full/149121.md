oxidability: /ˌɒksɪdəˈbɪləti/ /ˌɑːksɪdeɪˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可氧化性，易氧化性 | The susceptibility of a substance to oxidation.  It refers to the ease with which a substance loses electrons or combines with oxygen.  The higher the oxidability, the more readily the substance undergoes oxidation. | Example: The high oxidability of iron makes it prone to rusting.  铁的高氧化性使其容易生锈。  The oxidability of this material is being tested under various conditions.  这种材料的可氧化性正在各种条件下进行测试。 | 近义词：oxidizability | 反义词：resistance to oxidation
