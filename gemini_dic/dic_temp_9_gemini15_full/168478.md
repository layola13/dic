词源:
The word "probe" comes from the Middle English word "proben," meaning "to test" or "to try." This word, in turn, derives from the Old French word "prover," which ultimately traces back to the Latin word "probare," meaning "to prove" or "to test."  The modern sense of a physical instrument for exploration developed later.
