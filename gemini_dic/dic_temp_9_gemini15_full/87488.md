hetero-atom:/ˈhɛtərəʊˌætəm/| n. |杂原子|An atom in a molecule that is not a carbon or hydrogen atom.  Heteroatoms are often oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, phosphorus, or halogens. The presence of heteroatoms significantly influences the molecule's properties, such as polarity, reactivity, and boiling point.| Example:  In organic chemistry, nitrogen is a common heteroatom found in amines and amides.  在有机化学中，氮是胺和酰胺中常见的杂原子。|近义词: foreign atom, non-carbon atom |反义词:carbon atom, hydrogen atom


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in chemistry and related fields, so grammatical tenses and structures used with it would reflect scientific writing conventions.  There isn't a common usage of "heteroatom" in everyday conversation like the example word "what".  Therefore, providing tenses and structures like in the example would be artificial and unhelpful.


PHRASE->
heteroatom containing compound:含杂原子化合物
heteroatom substituted:杂原子取代
heteroatom distribution:杂原子分布
heteroatom effects:杂原子效应
heteroatom-containing polymer:含杂原子聚合物
