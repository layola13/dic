mesenchyma:/ˈmɛzəŋkaɪmə/| n. |间充质|Embryonic connective tissue from which are formed the connective tissues, blood vessels, and lymphatic vessels.  It is characterized by its stellate or spindle-shaped cells embedded in a gelatinous matrix.  |例句：Mesenchymal stem cells are multipotent and can differentiate into various cell types.  间充质干细胞是多能的，可以分化成各种细胞类型。|例句：The development of bone tissue involves the differentiation of mesenchymal cells into osteoblasts. 骨组织的发育涉及间充质细胞分化为成骨细胞。|近义词：mesoderm (in a developmental context)|反义词：epithelium (as it's a contrasting germ layer)|名词
