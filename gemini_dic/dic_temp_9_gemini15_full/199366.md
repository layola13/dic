词源:

The word "simony" derives from Simon Magus, a figure mentioned in the Book of Acts in the Bible.  Simon attempted to buy the power of the Holy Spirit from the apostles Peter and John.  This act became the archetypal example of the sin of simony, hence the name.  The word entered English in the 14th century.
