词源:
The word "deprovincialize" is a relatively modern coinage.  It's formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse") to "provincialize," which itself means "to make provincial" (narrow-minded, limited in outlook).  "Provincial" ultimately derives from the Latin word "provincia," meaning "province," suggesting a limited geographical and thus intellectual scope.
