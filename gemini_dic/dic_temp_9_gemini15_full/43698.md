词源:

The phrase "credited-to" combines the past participle "credited" (from the verb "credit," meaning to attribute or acknowledge) and the preposition "to," indicating the recipient of the credit.  The root of "credit" traces back to the Latin word "credere," meaning "to believe" or "to trust."  This reflects the idea that crediting someone implies belief in their contribution or achievement.
