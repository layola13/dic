magmas:/ˈmæɡməz/| n.|岩浆|Molten rock beneath the Earth's surface.  Magmas are complex mixtures of silicate minerals, gases, and sometimes crystals.|例句：The volcano erupted, spewing hot magmas and ash into the air.  火山爆发，喷出炽热的岩浆和火山灰。|近义词：molten rock, lava (when erupted)|反义词：solid rock


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Magma flows beneath the Earth's crust. = 岩浆在地壳下流动。
The magma chamber is slowly filling. = 岩浆房正在慢慢填充。

一般过去时:
The volcano erupted, releasing vast quantities of magma. = 火山爆发，释放出大量的岩浆。
Ancient magma flows formed this rock formation. = 古代岩浆流形成了这种岩石构造。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied the composition of various magmas. = 科学家们已经研究了各种岩浆的成分。
The Earth has generated enormous volumes of magma over geological time. = 地球在地质时期产生了大量的岩浆。


过去完成时:
The magma had already cooled significantly before the eruption ceased. = 在喷发停止之前，岩浆已经冷却得相当厉害了。
Geologists believed that the magma chamber had been depleted before the recent eruption. = 地质学家认为，在最近的火山爆发之前，岩浆房已经枯竭了。


将来时:
Scientists predict that the magma will eventually reach the surface. = 科学家预测岩浆最终将到达地表。
The rising magma will likely cause further seismic activity. = 上升的岩浆可能会导致进一步的地震活动。


虚拟语气:
If the magma were less viscous, it would flow more easily. = 如果岩浆粘度较低，它会更容易流动。
I wish I could directly observe the magma's movement. = 我希望我能直接观察岩浆的运动。


被动语态:
The rock samples were analyzed to determine the magma's composition. = 对岩石样本进行了分析以确定岩浆的成分。
The eruption was caused by the pressure of the underlying magma. = 喷发是由下方岩浆的压力引起的。


疑问句:
What is the temperature of the magma? = 岩浆的温度是多少？
What factors influence the viscosity of the magma? = 哪些因素会影响岩浆的粘度？


否定句:
The magma did not reach the surface during this eruption. = 在这次喷发中，岩浆没有到达地表。
This type of rock was not formed from magma. = 这种类型的岩石不是由岩浆形成的。


PHRASE->
Magma chamber = 岩浆房
Magma flow = 岩浆流
Magma viscosity = 岩浆粘度
Magmatic differentiation = 岩浆分异作用
Magma generation = 岩浆生成
