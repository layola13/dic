hypersonic:/ˌhaɪpəˈsɒnɪk/| adj.|超音速的，高超音速的|Exceeding five times the speed of sound; relating to or denoting speeds of this kind.|例句：The hypersonic missile is capable of reaching its target in minutes.  超音速导弹能够在几分钟内到达目标。

例句：Many countries are now investing heavily in hypersonic weapons technology. 许多国家现在正在大力投资高超音速武器技术。


近义词：supersonic (but hypersonic implies a much higher speed)|超音速的（但高超音速暗示速度更高）

反义词：subsonic,sonic|亚音速的，音速的


词源:
The word "hypersonic" is a combination of "hypo-" and "sonic".  "Hypo-" is a prefix meaning "under" or "below", but in this context, it's used to indicate "beyond" or "extremely". "Sonic" relates to sound, specifically the speed of sound. Therefore, hypersonic indicates speeds significantly exceeding the speed of sound.
