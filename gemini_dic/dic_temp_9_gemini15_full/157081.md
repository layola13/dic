词源:
The word "pin down" is a compound of two words: "pin" and "down".  "Pin" in this context refers to the act of securing something firmly, like a pin securing a piece of fabric. "Down" indicates the direction of securing, pressing something firmly to a surface. The figurative use evolved from the literal act of pinning something down.
