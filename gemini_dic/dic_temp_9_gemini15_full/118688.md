metabolizers:/məˈtæbəlaɪzərz/| n. |代谢者；（药物等的）代谢酶|People or enzymes that metabolize substances.  Individuals are classified as either fast, intermediate, or slow metabolizers based on their metabolic rate.|例句：The study investigated the effects of different drugs on various metabolizers. 这项研究调查了不同药物对各种代谢者的影响。

例句：Genetic variations can significantly impact the efficiency of metabolizers, leading to differing responses to medications. 基因变异会显著影响代谢者的效率，从而导致对药物的不同反应。
