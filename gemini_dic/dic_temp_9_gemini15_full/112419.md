The word "lotong" is not a word found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested.  It is possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name (person, place, or thing) specific to a particular region or context.
* **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.
* **It's a newly coined word or slang:**  It might be a very recent addition to the lexicon, not yet included in dictionaries.

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you can.  With more information, I can attempt a more accurate response.
