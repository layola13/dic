词源:

The word "expandibilities" is derived from the verb "expand," ultimately tracing back to the Latin word "expandere," meaning "to spread out."  The suffix "-ibility" denotes the capacity or capability of being expanded.  Therefore, "expandibilities" signifies the plural form of the capacity or potential for expansion.
