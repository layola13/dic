词源:
The term likely originated in the late 19th or early 20th century. "Dead" suggests a lack of energy or vitality, while "beat" might refer to being exhausted or worn out.  The combination suggests someone utterly lacking in motivation or responsibility.  The specific application to financial irresponsibility developed later.
