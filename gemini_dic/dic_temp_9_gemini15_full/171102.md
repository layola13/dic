词源:

The word "psychedelic" is a modern coinage.  It was formed in the 1950s by combining the Greek words "psyche" (ψυχή), meaning "mind" or "soul," and "dēlos" (δηλος), meaning "manifest" or "visible."  Therefore, "psychedelic" literally means "mind-manifesting" or "making the mind visible."  The term was popularized in the 1960s in association with the counterculture movement and the use of psychedelic drugs.
