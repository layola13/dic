词源：

The word "fairy" comes from Old French "faerie," meaning "fairyland," "enchantment," or "magic."  This, in turn, derives from Old French "faie," meaning "fairy," which likely evolved from a Latin word related to fate or destiny.  The connection is somewhat tenuous, but suggests an early association of fairies with supernatural or unpredictable forces.  The modern English word solidified its meaning over centuries, gradually shifting from a broader sense of enchantment to a more specific reference to the mythical beings we know today.
