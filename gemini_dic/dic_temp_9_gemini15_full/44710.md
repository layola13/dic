词源:  The word "cruelest" originates from the Old French word "cruel," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "crudelis."  "Crudelis" is composed of "crudus," meaning "raw, unripe, bloody," and the suffix "-elis," indicating a quality or characteristic.  The evolution suggests a connection between the concept of cruelty and something raw, unrefined, or lacking in compassion.  The "-est" suffix denotes the superlative degree, signifying the highest or most extreme level of cruelty.
