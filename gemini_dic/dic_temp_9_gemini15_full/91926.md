词源:
The term is a combination of "hyper-" (meaning excessive or beyond the norm) and "masculinities" (the plural of masculinity, referring to the qualities or traits associated with being male).  The plural form emphasizes the diversity of expressions and manifestations of extreme masculinity, rather than a single, monolithic concept.
