词源:
The word "lupoid" is derived from the Latin word "lupus," meaning "wolf."  The suffix "-oid" means "resembling" or "having the form of." Therefore, "lupoid" literally means "wolf-like" or "resembling a wolf," referring to the characteristic reddish, scaly, and sometimes ulcerative lesions that resemble a wolf's bite in appearance (a historical association with the disease).  The term's usage in medicine connects this visual similarity to lupus erythematosus.
