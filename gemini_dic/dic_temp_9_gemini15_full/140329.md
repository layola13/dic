USAGE->
This word is a suffix, not a standalone word, and therefore doesn't have verb conjugations or tenses like "What" does.  It only functions as part of a larger word.  It cannot be used in sentences independently.


PHRASE->
There are no phrases exclusively using "-ology" as a standalone element. Its usage is always within compound words.  Examples of compound words using "-ology" would be illustrative of phrases, but would need to be treated as separate entries.
