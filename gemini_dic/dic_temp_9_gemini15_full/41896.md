cosine:/ˈkoʊsaɪn/| n. |余弦|The cosine of an angle in a right-angled triangle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the length of the hypotenuse.  It's a trigonometric function widely used in mathematics, physics, and engineering.|例句：The cosine of 60 degrees is 0.5.  60度的余弦值为0.5。|近义词：sine, tangent (related trigonometric functions)|反义词：无|名词
