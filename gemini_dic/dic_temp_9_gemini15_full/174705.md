The word "quothing" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure dialect.

To help you,  I need more context. Where did you encounter this word? Knowing the source might help determine its intended meaning and allow for a more accurate analysis.
