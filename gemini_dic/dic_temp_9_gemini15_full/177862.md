receptory:/rɪˈsɛptəri/| n.|感受器；受体|A receptory is a specialized cell or group of cells that receives and responds to stimuli.  They are essential components of sensory systems and play crucial roles in various biological processes, including signal transduction. For example, nerve endings act as receptories for pain, pressure, and temperature. Similarly, cells in the eye contain receptories for light.|例句：The olfactory receptories in the nose detect various smells.|近义词：receptor, sensor|反义词：effector


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The olfactory receptories detect various smells. = 嗅觉感受器检测各种气味。
These receptories respond to specific stimuli. = 这些感受器对特定刺激做出反应。

一般过去时:
The researchers studied the function of the receptories. = 研究人员研究了感受器的功能。
The damaged receptories failed to transmit signals. = 受损的感受器未能传递信号。

现在完成时:
Scientists have identified many types of receptories. = 科学家已经发现了许多类型的感受器。
We have learned a lot about how receptories work. = 我们已经了解了很多关于感受器如何工作的知识。

过去完成时:
The cells had already activated their receptories before the signal arrived. = 在信号到达之前，细胞已经激活了它们的感受器。
The experiment had shown that the receptories were sensitive to light. = 实验表明，感受器对光敏感。

将来时:
Researchers will continue to study the role of receptories in disease. = 研究人员将继续研究感受器在疾病中的作用。
We will explore new ways to target receptories for drug development. = 我们将探索靶向感受器进行药物开发的新方法。

虚拟语气:
If the receptories were damaged, the signal would not be transmitted. = 如果感受器受损，信号将不会被传递。
It is important that the receptories function correctly. = 感受器正常运作很重要。

被动语态:
The receptories were activated by the stimulus. = 感受器被刺激激活。
New receptories are being discovered all the time. = 不断有新的感受器被发现。

疑问句:
What types of receptories are involved in this process? = 这个过程中涉及哪些类型的感受器？
How do these receptories respond to different stimuli? = 这些感受器如何对不同的刺激做出反应？

否定句:
The cells did not have functional receptories. = 这些细胞没有功能性感受器。
The drug did not affect the receptories. = 该药物不影响感受器。
