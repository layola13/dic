词源:

The word "intercalibrations" is derived from:

* **inter-**: a prefix meaning "between" or "among"
* **calibre/caliber**:  referring to the diameter or size of something, particularly a gun barrel, but extended to mean the quality or standard of something.  Ultimately from Arabic *qalib* meaning mould.
* **-ation**: a suffix forming nouns that denote an action or process.


Therefore, "intercalibration" literally means the process of adjusting the standards of measurement between or among multiple instruments. The plural form is "intercalibrations".
