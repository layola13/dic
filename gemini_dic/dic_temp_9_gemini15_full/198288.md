词源:

The word "shoulder" comes from Old English *sculdor, *sculdru, from Proto-Germanic *skuldō, ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *(s)kewl- ("to cut, cleave").  The original meaning likely referred to the part of the body that is "cut" or "separated" from the torso.  The connection to the act of cutting is perhaps less immediately apparent in modern usage, but is evident in etymological analysis of related words in other Indo-European languages.
