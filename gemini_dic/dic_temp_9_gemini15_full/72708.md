词源:
The word "focusable" is derived from the verb "focus" and the suffix "-able," indicating capability or possibility.  "Focus," in turn, has Latin roots, ultimately stemming from the Latin word "focus," meaning "hearth" or "fireplace."  The metaphorical extension to "center of attention" and then to "bring into sharp focus" evolved over time.
