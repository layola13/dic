The word "pegador" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a word from a language other than English, possibly Portuguese or Spanish, meaning "catcher" or "grabber".  I cannot provide a full analysis following your requested format as the word lacks established English usage, pronunciation, or etymology within the English language.  To provide a proper analysis, please provide the language of origin.
