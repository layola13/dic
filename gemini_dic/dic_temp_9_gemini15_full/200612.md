词源:

The word "slave" entered English from Old French "esclave," which in turn derived from the Slavic languages.  Originally, it referred specifically to Slavic people who were frequently enslaved in the Byzantine Empire and other parts of Europe.  Over time, its meaning broadened to encompass all forms of forced servitude.
