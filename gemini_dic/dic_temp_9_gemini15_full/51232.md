词源:  The word "destroying" comes from the verb "destroy," which itself has a complex etymology.  It ultimately derives from the Old French "destruire," meaning "to destroy," which in turn comes from the Latin "destruere."  "Destruere" is composed of the prefix "de-" (meaning "completely" or "away") and "struere" (meaning "to build" or "to arrange"). Therefore, the original meaning was literally "to unbuild" or "to pull completely apart".  The "-ing" suffix indicates the present participle, showing an ongoing action.
