The word "moting" is not a standard English word. There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a highly specialized field, or a word from a dialect or language other than English.
