词源:
The word "dyke" as a noun referring to an embankment comes from Middle Dutch *dike, ultimately from Proto-Germanic *dīkiz.  Its use as a derogatory slang term for a lesbian developed in the 20th century, its origin unclear but likely rooted in the association of lesbians with marginalized and outcast groups.  The use is considered offensive and should be avoided.
