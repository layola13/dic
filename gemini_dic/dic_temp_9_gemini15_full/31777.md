词源:
The word "checker" ultimately derives from the Old French word "echequier," meaning "chessboard."  This reflects the original meaning of the word, referring to the board game.  The extension to mean "one who checks" came later, reflecting the act of examining or verifying something systematically, much like the moves on a chessboard.
