词源:

The word "eventfulness" is derived from the noun "event" and the suffix "-fulness".  "Event" ultimately comes from the Old French word "event," meaning "outcome, result," which in turn derives from the Latin word "evenire," meaning "to happen, to come out." The suffix "-fulness" is a common English suffix indicating "full of" or "characterized by."  Therefore, "eventfulness" literally means "full of events."


用法说明：

Eventfulness is primarily used as a noun to describe a situation or period.  It's often used in more formal writing or speech to emphasize the significance or impact of numerous events.  It carries a more positive connotation than simply "many events," suggesting that the events were important or memorable.  It is not commonly used in everyday conversation.
