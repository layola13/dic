quasi-personably:/ˈkwɑːzaɪ ˈpɜːrsənəbli/| adj. |似是而非地像人一样；勉强称得上是个人|  The term "quasi-personably" describes something that only partially or superficially resembles a person, lacking the full qualities of a person.  It suggests a somewhat artificial or incomplete human-like quality.  The word combines "quasi" (meaning seemingly, apparently, or to a certain extent) with "personably" (meaning in a pleasant and likable manner).  Therefore, it implies a pleasant but ultimately inadequate or incomplete human-like quality. |例句：The AI assistant responded in a quasi-personably way, mimicking human conversation but lacking genuine emotion.  人工智能助理以一种似是而非地像人的方式回应，模仿人类的对话，但缺乏真正的感情。

The robot's movements were quasi-personably, mimicking human gait but with a slight stiffness.  机器人的动作似是而非地像人一样，模仿人类的步态，但略显僵硬。|近义词：semi-human, human-like, anthropomorphic (but less positive connotation)|反义词：inhuman, impersonal, unpersonable|词性：形容词
