近义词：courteously, kindly, politely, elegantly


反义词：rudely, impolitely, ungraciously


词源:  The word "graciously" derives from the adjective "gracious," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "gracieux," meaning "pleasing, graceful, thankful."  This in turn originates from the Latin word "gratia," meaning "grace, favor, gratitude."  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner in which an action is performed.
