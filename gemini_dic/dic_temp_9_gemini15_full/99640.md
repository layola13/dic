They are dynamic and evolve as speakers' proficiency improves.|例句：Esperanto is an example of a constructed interlanguage aimed at facilitating communication between people speaking different languages.  国际辅助语，例如世界语，就是为了促进不同语言使用者之间的交流而创造的中间语的例子。|近义词：pidgin, creole, lingua franca|反义词：native language, mother tongue
