pseudocoelom: /ˈsuːdoʊsiːləm/ | n. |假体腔|

英文解析:A pseudocoelom (also called a pseudocoel) is a body cavity that is not completely lined with mesoderm.  Unlike a true coelom (eucoelom), which is fully lined by mesoderm-derived peritoneum, a pseudocoelom is only partially lined with mesoderm.  The space between the gut and the body wall is filled with fluid, providing some hydrostatic support but lacking the complexity of a true coelom.  Animals with pseudocoeloms are called pseudocoelomates.

例句:
Many nematodes, such as roundworms, possess a pseudocoelom that functions in locomotion and internal transport. = 许多线虫，例如蛔虫，拥有一个假体腔，其功能是运动和内部运输。

The pseudocoelom of rotifers allows for efficient distribution of nutrients and waste products. = 轮虫的假体腔允许有效地分配营养物质和废物。
