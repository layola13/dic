词源:
The word "debonair" ultimately comes from the Old French "debonnaire," which means "good-natured," "gentle," or "kind."  This, in turn, is derived from "de" (of) and "bon" (good) + "aire" (having the nature of). The modern English meaning evolved over time, shifting from a general sense of pleasantness to the more specific connotation of sophisticated charm and elegance.
