microhm:/ˈmaɪkroʊm/| n. |微欧姆|A microhm is a unit of electrical resistance equal to one millionth of an ohm (10⁻⁶ ohm).  It's used to measure very small resistances. |The resistance of this wire is only a few microhms. 这根电线的电阻只有几微欧姆。|ohm, milliohm| megaohm|名词


USAGE->
This word is a noun and doesn't conjugate like verbs.  Therefore, tense and other verb conjugations are not applicable.  The usage focuses on its role in sentences and its relationship with other words.

Example Sentence 1: The circuit's low resistance, measured in microhms, indicates a good connection.  电路的低电阻（以微欧姆计）表明连接良好。

Example Sentence 2:  High-precision instruments are needed to accurately measure resistances in the microhm range. 需要高精度仪器才能精确测量微欧姆范围内的电阻。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "microhm."  Its usage is primarily within the context of electrical engineering and physics.  Phrases involving related units like "ohm" or "resistance" would be more relevant.  For example:

low resistance 低电阻
high resistance 高电阻
resistance measurement 电阻测量
measure resistance 测量电阻
electrical resistance 电阻
