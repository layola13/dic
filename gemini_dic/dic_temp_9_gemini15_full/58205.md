词源:
The word "drudgery" ultimately derives from the Old French word "druerie," meaning "love," "friendship," or "service."  However, its meaning shifted over time.  Through Middle English, the word evolved to refer to "servile labor" or "menial work," eventually settling on its current meaning of tedious, unpleasant work.  The shift in meaning likely reflects the changing social contexts and perceptions of labor.
