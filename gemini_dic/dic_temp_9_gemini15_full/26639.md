词源:
The word "cacochymy" comes from the Greek words "kakos" (κακός) meaning "bad," "evil," or "ugly," and "chymos" (χυμός) meaning "juice," "sap," or more figuratively, "sound" or "mixture."  Therefore, the word literally translates to something like "bad sound" or "bad mixture of sounds."  It is a relatively rare word, less common than its synonym "cacophony," but conveys a specific sense of unpleasantness and discordance.
