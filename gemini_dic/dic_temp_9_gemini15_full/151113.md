parasitism:/ˈpærəsaɪtɪzəm/ | n. |寄生;寄生现象 |The condition in which one organism lives on or in another organism and gets its food from or at the expense of its host, often without killing it.  Parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship where one organism (the parasite) benefits at the expense of another organism (the host).  The parasite may obtain nutrients, shelter, or locomotion from the host, while the host may suffer harm, ranging from mild irritation to death.  Different types of parasitism exist, depending on the relationship between the parasite and the host and the location of the parasite on or in the host. | 例句：Many plants exhibit parasitism, deriving nutrients from the roots of other plants.  许多植物表现出寄生现象，从其他植物的根部获取养分。

The parasitic relationship between the tick and the dog is detrimental to the dog's health. 蜱和狗之间的寄生关系对狗的健康有害。|近义词：parasitization, symbiosis (in a harmful context) |反义词：mutualism, commensalism
