The term "pre-Muslims" does not exist as a single, established word in the English language with a standardized definition and usage.  Therefore, a full breakdown in the requested format is impossible.  The term is a descriptive phrase, rather than a single lexical item.

However, we can analyze the components and how they might be used:

**pre- (prefix):** /ˈpriː/ | prefix |  之前，预先 |  Indicates something that comes before or precedes something else in time or order. |  Example: pre-flight check (飞行前的检查) |  No direct antonym, context dependent | prefix


**Muslim (noun):** /ˈmʌzlɪm/ | n. |穆斯林 | A follower of Islam. | Example: Many Muslims celebrate Ramadan. (许多穆斯林庆祝斋月) |  近义词：follower of Islam | 反义词： (No direct antonym; context-dependent, perhaps "non-Muslim") | noun


**Usage of "pre-Muslims":**

The phrase "pre-Muslims" is used to refer to people, cultures, or periods of time *before* the advent and spread of Islam in a particular region or among a specific group.  It's descriptive and its exact meaning depends heavily on context.  It could refer to:

* **People who lived in a region before the arrival of Islam:**  For example, "the pre-Muslim inhabitants of Arabia" would refer to the people living in Arabia before Islam became dominant.

* **Cultures or societies that existed before Islam:**  "Pre-Muslim traditions" might describe the customs and beliefs practiced before the adoption of Islam.

* **Historical periods prior to the rise of Islam:**  "The pre-Muslim era in Persia" would refer to the time before Islam became the dominant religion in Persia.

There is no standardized grammatical treatment for "pre-Muslims" as it is not a single word.  It functions adjectivally or nominally depending on usage.

**Examples:**

* "The pre-Muslim history of the region is complex and fascinating." (The phrase functions adjectivally, modifying "history")
* "Scholars have studied the art and architecture of the pre-Muslims." (The phrase functions nominally, serving as the object of the preposition "of")
* "Life for pre-Muslims in this area centered around agriculture and tribal structures." (The phrase functions adjectivally, modifying "life")


**Phrases:**

Due to its descriptive nature, providing common phrases involving "pre-Muslims" is difficult.  The usage is largely academic and historical.



In summary, "pre-Muslims" isn't a single word but a descriptive phrase used to refer to the period or people before the prevalence of Islam.  It lacks a formal grammatical treatment as a single word would have.
