The word "corvage" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a very specialized field, or a word from another language.


To provide helpful information, I need more context. Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the source might help determine its meaning and allow for a proper analysis.
