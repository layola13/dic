electro-analytical: /ɪˌlɛktrəʊəˈnælɪtɪkəl/ | adj. | 电分析的 | Relating to or using electrical methods for chemical analysis.  Electroanalytical methods involve measuring the electrical signals produced by the interaction of a chemical species with an electrode. These signals provide information about the concentration, properties, or reactivity of the analyte. | Example: Electroanalytical techniques are widely used in environmental monitoring to detect pollutants. 电分析技术广泛应用于环境监测以检测污染物。  | 近义词: electrochemical, voltammetric | 反义词:  None specifically, but could be contrasted with methods that don't use electricity, such as spectrophotometric methods. |

WORD ORIGIN->

The word "electro-analytical" is a compound word formed from:

* **electro-**:  A combining form meaning "electric," derived from Greek "elektron" (amber), referring to its ability to attract light objects after being rubbed.

* **analytical**: Adjective meaning "relating to or using analysis," derived from Greek "analyein" (to break down, resolve).

Therefore, "electro-analytical" literally means "relating to analysis using electricity."
