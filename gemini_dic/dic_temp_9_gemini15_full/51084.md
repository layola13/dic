词源:
The word "despatching" comes from the Old French word "despecher," meaning "to hasten," "to expedite," or "to dispatch."  This word ultimately derives from the Latin word "dispacare," which also carries the sense of "to make peace" or "to settle."  The modern English usage reflects the sense of quickly sending something or someone to their destination.
