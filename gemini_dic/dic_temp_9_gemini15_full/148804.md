The word "overvaries" does not exist in standard English.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis as requested.  To help, I need more context: where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the source might help determine the intended meaning and allow for a corrected analysis of the intended word.
