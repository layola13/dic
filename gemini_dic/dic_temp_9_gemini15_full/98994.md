USAGE->
This word is extremely rare and doesn't have common usage examples across different tenses.  The usage would depend heavily on the specific scientific context.  Examples would be constructed based on the specific field of study (e.g., physics, chemistry, materials science).  A general example is provided below:


一般现在时:
Interabsorptions occur frequently in complex systems. = 相互吸收作用在复杂系统中频繁发生。

一般过去时:
The researchers observed significant interabsorptions during the experiment. = 研究人员在实验中观察到明显的相互吸收作用。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied interabsorptions of various materials. = 科学家们已经研究了各种材料的相互吸收作用。

过去完成时:
They had not anticipated such strong interabsorptions before the experiment. = 在实验之前，他们没有预料到如此强的相互吸收作用。


将来时:
Future research will focus on modelling interabsorptions more accurately. = 未来的研究将集中在更精确地模拟相互吸收作用。


虚拟语气:
If the interabsorptions were stronger, the results would be different. = 如果相互吸收作用更强，结果就会不同。


被动语态:
Interabsorptions were measured using a novel technique. = 相互吸收作用是用一种新技术测量的。


疑问句:
Were there any significant interabsorptions detected? = 检测到任何明显的相互吸收作用吗？


否定句:
No significant interabsorptions were observed in this case. = 在这种情况下没有观察到明显的相互吸收作用。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "interabsorptions" as it's a highly specialized term.  Phrases would be context-specific and likely involve technical jargon within a particular scientific field.
