The word "retinal" does not exist in standard English.  There is a word "retina," which is what I will explain.

retina:/ˈrɛtɪnə/| n. |视网膜|The retina is the light-sensitive tissue lining the inner surface of the eye. It contains photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) that convert light into electrical signals, which are then transmitted to the brain via the optic nerve.  The retina is essential for vision.|例句：The damage to his retina significantly impaired his vision.  他的视网膜受损严重影响了他的视力。The doctor examined the patient's retina for signs of disease. 医生检查了病人的视网膜是否有疾病迹象。|近义词：fundus (in ophthalmology)|反义词：N/A|名词
