词源:

The word "generalizable" is derived from the verb "generalize," which itself comes from the noun "general" and the suffix "-ize" (meaning "to make" or "to cause to be").  "General" ultimately derives from the Old French "general," from the Latin "generalis," meaning "of or pertaining to a genus or kind; common; universal."  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or possibility.  Therefore, "generalizable" literally means "capable of being made general or universal."
