The word "goracco" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a neologism:**  It might be a newly coined word, specific to a certain community or context.  If this is the case, more information about where you encountered the word would be helpful.
* **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a name (place, person, etc.) that is not widely known.
* **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language and not yet integrated into English.


Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you'd like me to assist further.
