The word "luding" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical analysis as requested.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a neologism: A newly coined word not yet widely adopted.
* It's a proper noun: A name or place-specific term.
* It's jargon or slang:  Specific to a certain community or field.

Please provide the correct spelling or more context so I can assist you.
