词源:
The word "forego" comes from the Old English "forgān," meaning "to go before" or "precede."  Over time, its meaning shifted to imply "to give up" or "omit" something that comes later.  The prefix "fore-" indicates something that precedes or is placed before something else,  while "-go" relates to movement or action.
