monophanous:/mɒˈnɒfənəs/| adj.|单相的，单形的|Appearing in only one form or phase; exhibiting only one phase or aspect.  The term is often used in the context of crystallography and mineralogy to describe substances that don't exhibit polymorphism (the ability to exist in two or more different forms).|Example:  The mineral was described as monophanous in the scientific literature.|近义词：unvarying, uniform, single-phased|反义词：polymorphous, polymorphic


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The mineral sample appears monophanous under the microscope. = 在显微镜下，矿物样本呈现单相状态。
This substance remains monophanous across a wide temperature range. = 在很宽的温度范围内，这种物质保持单相状态。


一般过去时:
The research indicated that the material was monophanous at room temperature. = 研究表明该材料在室温下是单相的。
Scientists previously believed the compound was monophanous, but new evidence suggests otherwise. = 科学家们以前认为该化合物是单相的，但新的证据表明并非如此。


现在完成时:
Researchers have confirmed that the crystal structure has remained monophanous throughout the experiment. = 研究人员已经证实，在整个实验过程中，晶体结构一直保持单相。
Scientists have observed that the material exhibits monophanous behavior under normal conditions. = 科学家们观察到，这种材料在正常条件下表现出单相行为。


过去完成时:
Before the phase transition, the substance had been monophanous. = 在相变之前，该物质一直是单相的。
It had been assumed that the compound was monophanous until further analysis revealed otherwise. = 在进一步分析揭示事实并非如此之前，人们一直认为该化合物是单相的。


将来时:
The new synthesis method will likely produce a monophanous product. = 新的合成方法很可能产生单相产物。
We predict that the material will remain monophanous even at elevated temperatures. = 我们预测即使在高温下，该材料也会保持单相状态。


虚拟语气:
If the material were monophanous, the experiment would yield different results. = 如果该材料是单相的，实验结果将会不同。
It would be helpful if we could confirm that the substance is truly monophanous. = 如果我们能够确认该物质确实是单相的，那将很有帮助。


被动语态:
The monophanous nature of the substance was verified by X-ray diffraction. = 该物质的单相特性通过X射线衍射得到验证。
It has been determined that the sample is monophanous. = 已经确定该样本是单相的。


疑问句:
Is this material monophanous or polymorphic? = 这种材料是单相的还是多形的？
Are there any conditions under which this substance ceases to be monophanous? = 在什么条件下这种物质会不再是单相的？


否定句:
The compound is not monophanous; it exhibits polymorphism. = 该化合物不是单相的；它表现出多晶型现象。
This material is not always monophanous; it depends on the temperature and pressure. = 这种材料并非总是单相的；这取决于温度和压力。


PHRASE->
There are limited common phrases directly using "monophanous" due to its specialized scientific usage.  Instead, phrases would describe the lack of polymorphism, or the single-phase nature. Examples might include:  "exists in a single phase," "shows no polymorphism," "exhibits a monophased structure," "characterized by its monophased behavior," "single-phase material."
