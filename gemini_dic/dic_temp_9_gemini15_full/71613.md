词源:  The word "flatbread" is a compound word. "Flat" describes the shape of the bread, and "bread" refers to the baked food item.  The origin of the word "bread" traces back to Old English "brēad," related to Proto-Germanic "*brauþ" and ultimately to Proto-Indo-European "*bʰrew-", meaning "to boil" or "to brew."  The flat nature of the bread is a descriptive element added later in the word formation.
