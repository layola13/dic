词源:
pleasingly is derived from the adjective "pleasing," which comes from the verb "please."  "Please" ultimately originates from the Old French "plaisir," meaning "pleasure," which in turn derives from the Latin "placere," also meaning "to please" or "to be pleasing."  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb.
