etacism:/ˈɛtəsɪzəm/| n. | η音化；η音的过度使用 | The excessive use of the sound represented by the Greek letter eta (η), often resulting in the pronunciation of short e as a long e.  This is a historical linguistic phenomenon primarily observed in ancient Greek dialects.  | Example: The Athenian dialect showed a tendency towards etacism, blurring the distinction between short and long e sounds.  雅典方言表现出η音化的倾向，模糊了短元音e和长元音e之间的区别。|近义词：elongation (of vowel sound),  hypercorrection | 反义词：None specifically, but the opposite would be a consistent distinction between short and long e sounds.


USAGE->

There is no typical usage of "etacism" in standard grammatical structures like those demonstrated for the word "what".  Etacism is a linguistic phenomenon, not a word with verb conjugations or phrases.  It describes a historical sound change in certain dialects.  Its use is in describing language evolution and historical linguistics.
