deflagrate:/ˈdɛfləɡreɪt/ | v. | 爆燃；迅速燃烧 | To burn rapidly with a flash, often with explosive effect, but without the build-up of pressure characteristic of a detonation.  Deflagration is a type of combustion that propagates through a medium slower than the speed of sound. | Example: The dust deflagrated violently when ignited, causing significant damage.  尘埃被点燃后猛烈爆燃，造成重大损失。The fireworks deflagrated with a brilliant flash. 烟花爆燃发出耀眼的光芒。|近义词：ignite, combust, burn rapidly|反义词：smolder, detonate
