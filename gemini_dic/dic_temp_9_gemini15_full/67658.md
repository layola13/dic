词源：

The word "extrovert" is derived from the combination of the prefix "extra-" (meaning "outside" or "beyond") and the word "vert" (from Latin "vertere", meaning "to turn").  Thus, it literally means "turned outward," reflecting the outward focus of personality characteristic.  The term was coined by Carl Jung, a Swiss psychiatrist.
