词源:  The word "naturalistic" is derived from the noun "naturalism," which itself comes from the adjective "natural" + "-ism" (a suffix indicating a doctrine, system, or practice).  "Natural" originates from the Old French "naturel" and ultimately from the Latin "naturalis," meaning "of or belonging to nature."
