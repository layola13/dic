词源:
The word "decimate" comes from the Latin word "decimāre," which literally means "to take a tenth."  Originally, it referred to a Roman military punishment where one-tenth of the soldiers in a unit were executed as punishment for mutiny or other offenses. Over time, the meaning evolved to its current usage of significantly reducing a population or amount.
