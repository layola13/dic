词源:
The word "combatting" comes from the verb "combat," which originates from Old French "combattre," meaning "to fight."  The Old French word itself comes from the Latin "combattere," a combination of "com-" (together) and "battere" (to fight or strike).  Thus, the root meaning is "to fight together" or "to strike together."
