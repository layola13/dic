micro-electrode:/ˌmaɪkroʊˈɛləktrəʊd/| n. |微电极|A microelectrode is a very small electrode used to measure electrical potentials in biological systems or other microscopic environments.  It's characterized by its tiny size, typically on the order of micrometers, which allows for highly localized measurements. |Example: Researchers used a microelectrode to record the electrical activity of a single neuron.  研究人员用微电极记录单个神经元的电活动。|近义词：miniature electrode, ultramicroelectrode|反义词：macroelectrode
