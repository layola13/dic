词源:
The word "ply" ultimately derives from the Old English word "plian," meaning "to bend, fold, or weave." This reflects the original sense of the word, which involved bending or manipulating something, such as a loom in weaving or a tool in crafting.  Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass the repeated or persistent application of something, leading to its current usage.
