deculassement:  /ˌdeːkjuːlæsˈmɑːŋ/ | n. |  分级，等级划分 |  The word "deculassement" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism or a word from a specialized field (possibly French in origin, given the ending "-ment").  It likely combines elements suggesting "decuple" (tenfold) or "declassification" and "arrangement" or "classification".  Therefore, a reasonable interpretation of its meaning would be a system of classification or arrangement into ten levels or categories; a hierarchical ranking in ten grades.  Without further context, a precise definition is impossible. |  例句：The research team proposed a deculassement system for analyzing the data.（研究团队提出了一种用于分析数据的十级分类系统。）  |近义词：classification, categorization, stratification, ranking, hierarchy|反义词：randomization, unordering, aggregation
