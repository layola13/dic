词源:

The word "inflective" derives from the verb "inflect," which comes from the Latin word "inflectere," meaning "to bend," "to turn," or "to modulate."  In linguistics, this "bending" refers to the modification of a word's form to convey grammatical information.


用法说明:


The adjective "inflective" is primarily used in linguistics to describe languages or grammatical systems that employ inflection.  Inflection involves modifying the form of a word to indicate grammatical relationships such as tense, number, gender, case, and mood.  Languages with rich inflectional systems often have fewer function words (like prepositions and auxiliary verbs) because grammatical relationships are expressed through changes in word forms.  Conversely, isolating languages have little or no inflection; grammatical relationships are indicated primarily by word order and function words.

例句：

* The highly inflective nature of Latin makes it challenging for modern language learners.  拉丁语高度屈折的性质使得现代语言学习者难以学习。

*  Many linguists classify German as a highly inflective language. 许多语言学家将德语归类为高度屈折的语言。
