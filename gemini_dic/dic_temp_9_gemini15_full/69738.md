The word "feram" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling: Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a neologism: A newly coined word not yet widely accepted.
* It's a word from another language:  If it's from another language, please specify the language so I can try to translate and explain it.
* It's a proper noun:  If it's a name or place, more context would be needed.

Please provide more information or correct the spelling so I can assist you.
