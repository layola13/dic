词源:  The word "councilor" comes from the Old French word "conseilleur," meaning "counselor" or "advisor."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "consiliarius," which also means "counselor" or "advisor".  The "coun-" part comes from the Latin "consilium," meaning "council" or "deliberation."  The "-or" suffix is a common agent noun suffix in English indicating a person who performs a certain action or holds a certain position.
