devitrification:/ˌdiːˌvɪtrɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/| n. |失透; 脱玻化; 玻璃化消失|The process by which a glass or glassy substance loses its amorphous structure and becomes crystalline. This often occurs in volcanic glass or in manufactured glass products over time due to heat treatment or other factors.  The change can affect the properties of the material, such as its transparency and strength.| The devitrification of the volcanic glass resulted in the formation of crystalline minerals. 火山玻璃的失透导致了结晶矿物的形成。 The ancient glass beads showed signs of devitrification. 古代玻璃珠显示出失透的迹象。|crystallization, vitrification loss|amorphization, glass formation|名词
