词源:
The word "council" comes from the Old French word "concile," which in turn originates from the Late Latin word "concilium."  "Concilium" is derived from the Latin prefix "con-" (meaning "together") and the root "calēre" (meaning "to call").  Therefore, the original meaning points to a group of people called together for a purpose, such as deliberation or decision-making.
