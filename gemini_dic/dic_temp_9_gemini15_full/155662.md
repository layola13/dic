词源:

Phlegmaticnesses is the plural form of "phlegmaticness," which itself is derived from the adjective "phlegmatic."  "Phlegmatic" originates from the Greek word "phlegma" (φλέγμα), meaning "phlegm" or "mucus." In ancient Greek medicine, phlegm was considered one of four humors (along with blood, yellow bile, and black bile), and an excess of phlegm was believed to cause a calm, sluggish temperament.  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, "phlegmaticnesses" refers to multiple instances or degrees of this calm, unemotional temperament.
