词源:

The word "gentilesse" is derived from Old French "gentilesse," meaning "nobility, gentle birth, courtesy."  This, in turn, originates from the Latin "gentilis," meaning "of a family, belonging to a clan or race," which is related to "gens," meaning "family, clan, race."  The semantic shift from "noble birth" to "refined manners" occurred over time, reflecting the association of politeness and grace with aristocratic culture.
