kingest:/ˈkɪŋɪst/| adj.|最国王的；最像国王的；最伟大的|The word "kingest" is not a standard word in modern English. It's a superlative form of "kingly," attempting to create a superlative adjective meaning "most kingly" or "most like a king."  However,  it's considered non-standard and unnatural due to the already existing superlative "most kingly" or descriptive phrases like "most regal."  Its usage would be highly unusual and likely perceived as incorrect or humorous.|例句：He behaved in the kingest manner possible during the ceremony. 他在仪式上表现得尽可能像国王一样。（非标准用法）|近义词：most kingly, most regal, supremely majestic|反义词：most humble, most subservient|形容词
