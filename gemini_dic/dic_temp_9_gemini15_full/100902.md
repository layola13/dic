词源:
The word "intuition" comes from the Latin word "intuitio," which means "a looking at," "contemplation," or "insight."  It's related to the verb "intueri," meaning "to look at, contemplate, or consider attentively."  The modern English word retained the sense of immediate understanding or knowledge gained without conscious reasoning.
