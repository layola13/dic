flexural:/ˈflɛkʃərəl/ | adj. |弯曲的；挠曲的 | Relating to or involving bending or flexing.  The term describes something that is capable of bending or being bent, or the act of bending itself.  It often relates to the stress and strain on materials due to bending forces. | Example: The bridge's flexural strength was tested under extreme conditions. 这座桥的抗弯强度在极端条件下进行了测试。The flexural rigidity of the beam was insufficient.  这梁的抗弯刚度不足。 |近义词：bending, flexile, pliable |反义词：rigid, inflexible, stiff |


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The beam experiences flexural stress. = 这根梁承受着弯曲应力。

将来时:
We will analyze the flexural properties of the new alloy. = 我们将分析这种新型合金的抗弯性能。
The design will ensure sufficient flexural stiffness. = 该设计将确保足够的抗弯刚度。


虚拟语气:
If the material were more flexural, it would bend more easily. = 如果材料更易弯曲，它就会更容易弯曲。
I wish the design had considered flexural fatigue. = 我希望设计中考虑到了弯曲疲劳。


被动语态:
The component is subjected to flexural loading. = 该组件承受弯曲载荷。
