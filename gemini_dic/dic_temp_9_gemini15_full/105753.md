The word "király" is not English.  It's Hungarian.  Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis following the requested English-word format.  The format requires an English word as input.  However, I can provide an analysis of the Hungarian word "király" in a similar format.


király: /ˈkiraːj/ | n. | 国王 | King, monarch, ruler |  A királynő a király felesége. = The queen is the king's wife. |  herceg (prince), fejedelem (prince/chieftain) |  nép (people), alattvaló (subject) | noun

These phrases would use "király" in common Hungarian expressions. Again, a direct translation to English phrases is not always possible due to grammatical differences.  I'll give examples showing how it's used contextually:
