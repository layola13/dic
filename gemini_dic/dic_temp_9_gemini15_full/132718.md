nondistributivenesses:/ˌnɒnˌdɪstrɪbjuːtɪvənəsɪz/ | n. |非分配性；非分配特征|The word "nondistributivenesses" refers to the instances or qualities of lacking distributivity.  Distributivity, in various contexts (mathematics, logic, linguistics), refers to the ability to distribute an operation over elements of a set or structure.  Therefore, nondistributivenesses are the absences or failures of this ability. This is a very uncommon word, mainly found in specialized academic contexts like mathematical logic or theoretical linguistics. The plural form highlights multiple instances or types of such non-distributive properties. |Example:  The analysis revealed several subtle nondistributivenesses in the grammatical system.  (分析揭示了语法系统中一些细微的非分配性特征。)  |近义词:lack of distributivity, non-distributive properties|反义词:distributivities|名词
