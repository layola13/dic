pseudogamous:/ˈsjuːdəʊˈɡæməs/| adj.|假受精的，伪受精的|Relating to or characterized by pseudogamy, a type of fertilization in which the pollen tube penetrates the ovule but the male gamete does not fuse with the egg cell.  The ovule develops into a seed without fertilization by a sperm cell.|例句：The development of the seed in this plant species is pseudogamous, resulting in offspring genetically identical to the mother plant.|近义词：parthenogenetic (if referring to the resulting asexual reproduction)|反义词：gamous (true fertilization)

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The process is pseudogamous. = 这个过程是假受精的。
This plant exhibits pseudogamous reproduction. = 这种植物表现出假受精繁殖。

一般过去时:
The researchers observed pseudogamous fertilization. = 研究人员观察到了假受精。
The experiment demonstrated pseudogamous seed development. = 实验证明了假受精的种子发育。

现在完成时:
Scientists have studied many examples of pseudogamous reproduction. = 科学家们已经研究了许多假受精繁殖的例子。
Botanists have documented numerous cases of pseudogamous plants. = 植物学家们已经记录了许多假受精植物的案例。

过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the mechanism was not understood to be pseudogamous. = 在发现之前，人们不理解其机制是假受精的。
They had previously assumed the reproduction was not pseudogamous. = 他们之前曾假设繁殖不是假受精的。

将来时:
Future research will investigate the genetic basis of pseudogamous reproduction. = 未来的研究将调查假受精繁殖的遗传基础。
Scientists will further explore the prevalence of pseudogamy in various plant species. = 科学家们将进一步探索各种植物物种中假受精的普遍性。

虚拟语气:
If the fertilization were pseudogamous, the offspring would be clones. = 如果受精是假受精的，后代将是克隆体。
It is possible that this plant's reproduction is pseudogamous, although further research is needed. = 这种植物的繁殖可能是假受精的，尽管还需要进一步研究。


被动语态:
Pseudogamous reproduction has been observed in several plant families. = 在几个植物科中都观察到了假受精繁殖。
The mechanism of pseudogamous seed formation is being investigated. = 正在研究假受精种子形成的机制。


疑问句:
Is the seed development in this species pseudogamous? = 这个物种的种子发育是假受精的吗？
Are there any other examples of pseudogamous reproduction in this genus? = 在这个属中还有其他假受精繁殖的例子吗？


否定句:
The reproduction is not pseudogamous; it involves true fertilization. = 繁殖不是假受精的；它涉及真正的受精。
This species does not exhibit pseudogamous characteristics. = 这个物种不表现出假受精的特征。
