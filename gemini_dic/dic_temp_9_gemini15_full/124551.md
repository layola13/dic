词源:

The word "mounted" comes from the Old French word "monter," meaning "to climb" or "to ascend."  This in turn has roots in the Latin word "montare," with similar meaning.  The English usage reflects both the sense of "climbing onto" (as in riding a horse) and "fixing onto" (as in mounting a picture).
