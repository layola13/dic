outcaught:/ˌaʊtˈkɔːt/| v.| 超过…捕获；胜过…捕捉 |  This word is a relatively rare and archaic formation, combining "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent than") and "caught" (the past participle of "catch").  It implies surpassing someone else in catching something, typically game or fish. The meaning emphasizes the exceeding of another's catch, not merely catching something. | 例句：The experienced fisherman outcaught his younger competitor, bringing in twice the number of salmon.  经验丰富的渔夫比他年轻的竞争对手捕获了更多的鲑鱼，数量是他的两倍。
