To your health!  干杯！祝你健康！ | cheers, to your health |  namaste (though not directly opposite in meaning, it serves a different purpose) | interjection


USAGE->
This word is an interjection, so it doesn't conjugate like verbs or change forms like nouns or adjectives.  It's used as a complete utterance.

PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases built around "prosit" in the same way there are with words like "what."  It functions independently as a toast.
