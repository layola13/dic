radialities: /ˌreɪdiˈælɪtiz/ | n. |辐射性；辐射状排列；辐射影响 | The word "radialities" refers to the quality or state of being radial, involving or characterized by rays or lines emanating from a common center.  It can describe the pattern of something radiating outwards, the effects spreading from a central point, or the properties of radiation itself.  The term is less common than its related words "radiality" or phrases describing radial patterns. | Example: The artist's work explored the visual impact of radialities, creating stunning patterns of light and color spreading from central points.  | 近义词: radiation, emanations, diffusion, spread | 反义词: concentration, convergence
