词源:
The word "porcelainized" is derived from "porcelain" and the suffix "-ized," which indicates the process of making something like porcelain.  "Porcelain" itself has a complex etymology, ultimately originating from the Italian word "porcellana," referring to the cowrie shell, due to the resemblance in appearance to porcelain.
