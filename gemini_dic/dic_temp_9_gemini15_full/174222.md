The word "quential" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis according to your requested format.  If you intended a different word, please provide the correct spelling.
