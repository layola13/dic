词源:
The word is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adverb "revoltingly" (meaning "in a disgusting or repulsive manner").  "Revoltingly" is derived from the verb "revolt," meaning "to cause intense disgust or revulsion."  The ultimate root can be traced back to the Latin word "volvere," meaning "to roll or turn."  The sense of turning away in disgust evolved from this root.
