词源:
The word "hitch" ultimately derives from the Old English word "hiccan," meaning "to cough, hiccup,"  which suggests a sudden, jerky movement.  The sense of fastening likely developed from the image of a sudden, secure fastening, like a hook catching. The sense of a problem or snag likely arose from the interruption or impediment caused by such a hitch.
