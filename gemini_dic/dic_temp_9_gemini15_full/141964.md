oreodont:/ˈɔːriədɒnt/| n. |臼齿兽类|Oreodonts were a group of extinct herbivorous mammals that lived in North America during the Oligocene and Miocene epochs. They were characterized by their bunodont molars (molars with rounded cusps), which were well-suited for grinding plant material.  They were relatively small to medium-sized animals, and their fossils have been found in many locations across North America. | Example: The discovery of new oreodont fossils in Nebraska shed light on their evolution and habitat. |近义词: (no direct synonyms, as it refers to a specific extinct group)  |反义词: (no direct antonyms)|名词
