The word "gloser" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word, jargon specific to a particular field, or slang used within a certain community.  If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it might be possible to understand its meaning.
* **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a name or place name.


Please provide more information or correct the spelling so I can assist you.
