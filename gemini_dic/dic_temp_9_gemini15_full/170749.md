pseudobranch:/ˈsuːdoʊbræŋtʃ/| n. |假鳃|A pseudobranch is a gill-like structure found in some fishes, particularly those with well-developed vascular systems.  Unlike true gills, it's not directly involved in respiration but is thought to have functions related to oxygenation of the eye and other tissues, as well as osmoregulation.  It's often located near the eye or gill chamber. |例句：The pseudobranch in this fish species is unusually large and highly vascularized.  这条鱼的假鳃异常大且血管丰富。|例句：Studies suggest the pseudobranch plays a crucial role in maintaining the oxygen supply to the eye. 研究表明假鳃在维持眼睛的氧气供应方面起着至关重要的作用。|近义词：accessory gill (有时，取决于上下文)|反义词：true gill|名词
