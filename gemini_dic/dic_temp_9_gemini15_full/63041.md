词源:
The word "enravishment" comes from the verb "enrapture," which itself is derived from the Old French word "enraptir," meaning "to transport," "to carry away," or "to enchant."  The prefix "en-" intensifies the meaning.  The root is ultimately linked to the Latin word "rapere," meaning "to seize" or "to snatch away."  Therefore, "enravishment" originally describes a state of being completely seized or overwhelmed by joy or delight.
