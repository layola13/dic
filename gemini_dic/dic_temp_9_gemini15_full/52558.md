diffracts:/dɪˈfrækts/| v. |衍射；绕射| To spread out after passing through a narrow opening or across an edge, or when waves of light, heat, or sound meet an obstacle.|The light diffracts as it passes through the narrow slit. 光线穿过狭缝时发生衍射。|The sound waves diffract around the building. 声波绕过建筑物发生衍射。|近义词：bend, spread, scatter |反义词：focus, concentrate


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Light diffracts when it passes through a narrow slit. = 光线穿过狭缝时发生衍射。
The sound diffracts around the corners of the room. = 声音在房间的角落发生衍射。

一般过去时:
The light diffracted as it passed through the prism. = 光线穿过棱镜时发生了衍射。
The waves diffracted around the obstacle. = 波浪绕过障碍物发生了衍射。

现在完成时:
The scientist has shown that light has diffracted. = 科学家已经证明光发生了衍射。
The experiment has demonstrated how sound diffracts. = 实验已经证明了声音是如何衍射的。

过去完成时:
The diffraction pattern had already formed before the observation began. = 在观察开始之前，衍射图样就已经形成了。
They had found that the X-rays diffracted in a specific pattern. = 他们发现X射线以特定的图案衍射。

将来时:
The laser beam will diffract when it encounters the grating. = 当激光束遇到光栅时，它将发生衍射。
We expect the waves to diffract significantly in this experiment. = 我们预计波浪在这个实验中会发生明显的衍射。

虚拟语气:
If the aperture were smaller, the light would diffract more. = 如果孔径更小，光线将会衍射得更多。
If the waves had diffracted differently, the result would have been different. = 如果波浪的衍射方式不同，结果就会不同。

被动语态:
The light was diffracted by the grating. = 光线被光栅衍射了。
The sound waves were diffracted by the mountains. = 声波被山脉衍射了。

疑问句:
Does the light diffract significantly in this experiment? = 光在这个实验中是否发生了明显的衍射？
How does the sound diffract around the object? = 声音是如何绕过物体发生衍射的？

否定句:
The light did not diffract noticeably in this case. = 在这种情况下，光线没有明显地发生衍射。
The waves did not diffract as much as expected. = 波浪的衍射程度不如预期。


PHRASE->
light diffracts = 光衍射
