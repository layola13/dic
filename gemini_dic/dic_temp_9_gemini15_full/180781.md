词源:
The word "regulus" comes from the Late Latin word *regulus, a diminutive of rex ("king").  In alchemy, it referred to the metallic substance remaining after smelting, often considered the purest and most valuable part.  The astronomical and ornithological uses are later extensions of this original meaning.
