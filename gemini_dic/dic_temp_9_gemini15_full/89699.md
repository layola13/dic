词源:
The word "Hoover" originates from the name of the American company, Hoover, which was a pioneer in the manufacture and marketing of vacuum cleaners.  The brand name became so ubiquitous that it became a generic term for vacuum cleaners in many English-speaking countries, similar to how "Kleenex" is used for tissues.
