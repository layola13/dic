词源:
The word "reformist" is derived from the verb "reform," which itself comes from the Old French word "reformer," meaning "to form again" or "to reshape." The prefix "re-" indicates repetition or reversal, while the root "-form" relates to shape or structure.  The "-ist" suffix transforms the verb into a noun or adjective denoting a person or thing associated with the action. Therefore, a "reformist" is someone who advocates for or engages in reforming something.
