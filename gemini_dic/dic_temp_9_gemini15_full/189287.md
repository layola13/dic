词源:
The word "sadistically" derives from the adjective "sadistic," which in turn comes from the name of the Austrian physician Richard von Krafft-Ebing (1840-1902).  He coined the term "sadism" to describe the tendency to derive pleasure from inflicting pain on others, naming it after the Marquis de Sade (1740-1814), a French aristocrat and writer whose works often featured extreme violence and sexual cruelty.  The suffix "-ically" is an adverbial suffix indicating "in a ... manner".
