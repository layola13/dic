premaxilla: /ˌpriːˈmæksɪlə/ | n. | 前颌骨 | The premaxilla is a small bone in the upper jaw, located at the very front, which forms the anterior part of the hard palate and houses the incisor teeth.  It is often fused with the maxilla in many mammals.  In some species, it is a separate bone. | Example: The premaxilla in humans is fused to the maxilla, forming the upper jaw. 人类的前颌骨与上颌骨融合，形成上颌。|近义词: incisive bone (部分情况下)|反义词: maxilla (相对位置)
