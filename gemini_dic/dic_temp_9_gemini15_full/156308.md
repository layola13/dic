The word "physemaria" is not found in standard English dictionaries or etymology resources.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a technical term from a very specialized field, or a name (possibly of a person, place, or thing).  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide the requested information, I need a correct spelling or more context about where you encountered this word.
