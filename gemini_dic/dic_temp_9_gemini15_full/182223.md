词源:  The word "remoralization" is derived from the verb "remoralize," which itself is formed from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "anew") and the noun "moralization," which comes from "moral" (relating to principles of right and wrong behavior) and the suffix "-ization" (indicating the process of making something into something else).  Therefore, remoralization literally means the process of making something moral again.
