ignitability:/ˌɪɡnɪtəˈbɪləti/| n. |易燃性，可燃性|The ability of a substance to ignite and burn.  It is often measured by its flash point and autoignition temperature. |例句：The ignitability of the fuel made it dangerous to store near an open flame.  这种燃料的易燃性使得它危险地储存在明火附近。
The high ignitability of the material requires special handling procedures.这种材料的高度易燃性需要特殊的处理程序。|近义词：flammability, combustibility |反义词：non-flammability, incombustibility|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The ignitability of this material is high. = 这种材料的易燃性很高。
What is the ignitability rating of this chemical? = 这种化学品的易燃性等级是多少？


一般过去时:
The ignitability of the wood was tested yesterday. = 昨天测试了木材的易燃性。
The ignitability was significantly lower after treatment. = 处理后，易燃性显著降低。


现在完成时:
Scientists have determined the ignitability of the new compound. = 科学家们已经确定了这种新化合物的易燃性。
We have assessed the ignitability risk of the project. = 我们已经评估了该项目的易燃性风险。


过去完成时:
They had already checked the ignitability before the experiment. = 他们在实验前已经检查过易燃性了。
The engineers had underestimated the ignitability of the gas. = 工程师们低估了这种气体的易燃性。


将来时:
We will test the ignitability of the sample tomorrow. = 我们明天将测试样品的易燃性。
The team will determine the ignitability limits of the mixture. = 该团队将确定混合物的易燃性极限。


虚拟语气:
If the ignitability were lower, the risk would be reduced. = 如果易燃性更低，风险就会降低。
I wish the ignitability of this fuel was lower. = 我希望这种燃料的易燃性更低。


被动语态:
The ignitability was measured using a standard test. = 易燃性是使用标准测试方法测量的。
The ignitability of the substance is being investigated. = 正在调查该物质的易燃性。


疑问句:
What is the ignitability of this substance? = 这种物质的易燃性是多少？
How is the ignitability determined? = 易燃性是如何确定的？


否定句:
The ignitability is not high enough to be a concern. = 易燃性不高，不足为虑。
This material does not have a high ignitability. = 这种材料的易燃性不高。


PHRASE->
high ignitability = 高度易燃性
low ignitability = 低易燃性
test ignitability = 测试易燃性
assess ignitability = 评估易燃性
determine ignitability = 确定易燃性

词源:
ignite (动词，点燃) + -ability (后缀，表示能力或性质)  Ignite itself comes from the Latin word "ignis" meaning "fire".
