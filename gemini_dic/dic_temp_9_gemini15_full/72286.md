词源:
Flotsam comes from the Old French *flotaison*, meaning "floating," derived from *flot*, "float."  Jetsam, also from Old French, comes from *jeter*, "to throw."  Originally, jetsam referred specifically to goods thrown overboard to lighten a ship.  The combined phrase now typically refers to all kinds of floating debris.
