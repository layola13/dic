The word "golyardeys" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure lexicon.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide you with the requested information, I need a valid English word.
