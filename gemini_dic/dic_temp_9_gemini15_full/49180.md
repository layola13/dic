词源:
The word "delamination" is derived from the prefix "de-" (meaning "removal" or "separation") and the word "lamination," which refers to the process of forming layers.  "Lamination" in turn comes from the Latin word "lamina," meaning "thin plate" or "layer."  Thus, "delamination" literally means "the separation of layers."
