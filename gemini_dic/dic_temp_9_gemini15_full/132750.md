反义词：dogmatically, rigidly, inflexibly, authoritarianly


词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") + "dogmatically" (from "dogma," meaning a principle or set of principles laid down by an authority as incontrovertibly true).  The suffix "-ly" indicates an adverbial form, but here it's used to create an adjective.  "Dogma" itself comes from the Greek word "dόgma" (δόγμα), meaning "opinion," "belief," or "decree."


USAGE->
This word is primarily an adverbial adjective, modifying verbs and describing the manner in which something is done.  There's not a distinct tense conjugation as it's an adjective, not a verb.
