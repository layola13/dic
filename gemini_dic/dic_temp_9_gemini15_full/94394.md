词源：
The word "implementing" comes from the verb "implement," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "impleō," meaning "to fill up" or "to fulfill."  The Latin word evolved through Old French ("impleter") before becoming established in English. The "-ing" suffix indicates the present participle, showing an ongoing action.
