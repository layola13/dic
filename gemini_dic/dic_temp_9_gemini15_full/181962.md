词源:

* **marshal:**  From Old French *maréchal*, from Frankish *marko* "horse" + *skalko* "servant".  Originally referring to a servant in charge of horses, the meaning evolved to include military and ceremonial leaders.

* **re-:**  A prefix meaning "again" or "back".

Therefore, "remarshalled" literally means "to marshal again," implying a second organization or arrangement.
