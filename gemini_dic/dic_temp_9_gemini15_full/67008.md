The word "exping" is not a standard English word found in common dictionaries or lexicons.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), slang, or specific to a particular context (e.g., jargon within a certain field).  To provide the requested analysis, more information is needed about where you encountered this word.

If you can provide context (sentence, paragraph, or source), I can offer a possible interpretation and analysis based on that context.
