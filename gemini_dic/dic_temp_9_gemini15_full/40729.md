convexity: /kɒnˈvɛksɪti/ | n. | 凸度；凸性 | The state or quality of being convex; curvature of a surface outward from a central point.  It refers to the degree of curvature of a curved surface or line. In mathematics, especially geometry and calculus, it has precise definitions and applications, particularly in the study of curves and surfaces. In finance, it refers to the relationship between the price of a bond and its yield, and it is a crucial factor affecting the bond's risk. | 例句：The lens has a high degree of convexity. 这块透镜具有高度的凸度。


The high convexity of the curve made it difficult to calculate the area under it. 曲线的凸度很高，使得计算其下方的面积变得困难。


近义词：curvature, bulging, protrusion | 反义词：concavity

词源:

Comes from the Latin word "convexus," meaning "arched," "vaulted," or "bulging."  The prefix "con-" intensifies the meaning, and "-vexus" is related to the verb "vehere," meaning "to carry" or "to convey," suggesting a carrying or bulging outward.
