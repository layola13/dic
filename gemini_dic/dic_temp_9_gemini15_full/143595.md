词源：
The word "outhustled" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "to a greater degree than," "surpass") and the verb "hustle," which originally meant to "push or shove roughly" but evolved to mean "to act energetically and aggressively, especially in business or competition."  Therefore, "outhustled" signifies surpassing someone through energetic and aggressive actions.
