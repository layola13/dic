coarticulation:/ˌkoʊ.ɑːrˈtɪk.jəˈleɪ.ʃən/| n. |协同发音|The overlapping articulation of speech sounds.  It is a phenomenon where the production of one phoneme is influenced by the phonemes that precede and follow it. This influence can affect the articulation of the phoneme itself, resulting in changes to its acoustic properties.  Coarticulation is a natural process that makes speech more efficient and fluent.  For example, the pronunciation of the /t/ sound in "ten" is different from the pronunciation of /t/ in "top" because of the influence of the following vowels. |Example: The /l/ in "lip" is often velarized (the back of the tongue is raised towards the velum) due to coarticulation with the following vowel /ɪ/.  The way we pronounce the 'b' in 'boot' is different than the 'b' in 'bat' because of coarticulation.|近义词:speech overlap, articulatory interaction|反义词:N/A
