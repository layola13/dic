词源:  The word "poltroon" entered English in the 16th century,  borrowed from the Old French "poltron," which itself likely derived from a combination of the Old French "poltre" (meaning "colt" or "young horse") and a diminutive suffix "-on." The etymological connection to "colt" isn't entirely clear, but suggests a sense of youthfulness or immaturity combined with lack of strength or courage.  The shift in meaning from a young, weak animal to a cowardly person is likely due to the association of weakness with cowardice.
