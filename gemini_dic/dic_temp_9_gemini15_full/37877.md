词源：
The word "complacent" comes from the Latin word "complacēre," which means "to please," "to gratify," or "to soothe."  The prefix "com-" indicates "together," and "placēre" is the infinitive of the verb "placēre," meaning "to please." Therefore, the original meaning implied being pleased with oneself, which eventually evolved into the modern connotation of self-satisfaction to the point of inaction.
