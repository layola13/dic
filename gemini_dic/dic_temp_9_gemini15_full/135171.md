nonoppressivenesses:/ˌnəʊnɒʊəˈprɛsɪvnɪsɪz/| n. |非压迫性；非压迫状态的多种情况|The word "nonoppressivenesses" is not a standard English word. It's a highly unusual and artificial construction, formed by combining "non" (meaning "not"), "oppressive" (meaning causing suffering or hardship), and adding the plural suffix "-nesses" to create a plural noun referring to multiple instances of the absence of oppression.  It's grammatically correct but semantically awkward and practically unusable in normal communication. A more natural and concise way to express the concept would be to use phrases like "instances of non-oppression," "lack of oppression," or "freedom from oppression."|The absence of oppression is vital for a healthy society. = 没有压迫对健康的社会至关重要。  The multiple nonoppressivenesses experienced by the community were a testament to their resilience.  = 社区经历的多种非压迫状态证明了他们的韧性。(This sentence uses the word, but is highly unnatural).|近义词:lacks of oppression, freedoms from oppression, instances of non-coercion|反义词:oppressions, tyrannies, repressions|名词
