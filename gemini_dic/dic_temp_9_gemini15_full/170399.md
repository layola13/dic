词源：From Old French *proveist, from Old French prevost, from Vulgar Latin *praepositus, from Latin praepositus, past participle of praeposīre "to place before, set over," from prae- "before" + ponere "to put, place."  The word's evolution reflects its original meaning of someone placed in authority over others.
