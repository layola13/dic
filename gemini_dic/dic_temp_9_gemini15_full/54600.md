词源:
The word "dismarshal" is formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away," "apart," or "reverse") to the word "marshal."  "Marshal" itself has roots in Old French, ultimately deriving from Germanic words related to "horse" and "servant," reflecting the historical role of marshals as those who managed horses and stables, later evolving into military and judicial roles.  Therefore, "dismarshal" literally means to "un-marshal," or to reverse the actions of a marshal.
