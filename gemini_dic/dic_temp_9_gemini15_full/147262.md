词源:

The word "overmerry" is a straightforward combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the adjective "merry" (meaning "joyful" or "happy").  The word's origins trace back to Old English "mǣrre," meaning "famous" or "renowned," which evolved to mean "joyful" over time.  Therefore, "overmerry" literally means "excessively joyful."
