monoecia:/moʊˈniːʃə/| n. |雌雄同株（植物）|Plants with both male and female reproductive organs on the same individual.  This contrasts with dioecious plants, where male and female reproductive organs are on separate individuals.  Monoecious plants can still require cross-pollination for genetic diversity, but self-pollination is also possible.|Example:  Oak trees are monoecious, meaning they have both male and female flowers on the same tree.  橡树是雌雄同株的，这意味着它们在同一棵树上同时拥有雄花和雌花。|近义词:hermaphrodite (in plants)|反义词:dioecy
