词源:
"Creepy-crawliest" is the superlative form of "creepy-crawly."  "Creepy" comes from "creep," meaning to move slowly and silently, often in a sinister way.  "Crawly" comes from "crawl," meaning to move on hands and knees or in a similar low manner.  The combination describes small, often insect-like creatures that move in a way that is both unsettling and visually disturbing.
