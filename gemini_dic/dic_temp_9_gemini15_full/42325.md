词源:
The word "counter-spell" is a compound word.  "Counter" is from Old French *contrer, meaning "to oppose" or "to act against," ultimately from Latin *contra, meaning "against."  "Spell" comes from Old English *spell, meaning "a story, a word," related to the verb "to speak."  Therefore, "counter-spell" literally means "a spell that acts against another spell."
