combinational:/ˌkɒmbɪˈneɪʃənəl/ /ˌkɑːmbɪˈneɪʃənəl/ | adj. |组合的；组合逻辑的| Relating to or involving combination; specifically in electronics, referring to circuits whose output depends only on the present input and not on past inputs.  This contrasts with sequential circuits which have memory. |例句：The combinational circuit directly translates the inputs into outputs.  组合电路直接将输入转换为输出。

The system uses a combinational logic approach to process data. 这个系统使用组合逻辑方法来处理数据。


近义词：compound, combined, composite |反义词：sequential, sequential logic


词源:  Derived from "combination," which comes from the Old French *combinaison and ultimately from the Latin *combinare ("to combine"). The suffix "-al" denotes an adjective.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The system is combinational in nature. = 该系统本质上是组合式的。
This circuit is combinational; its output depends only on current inputs. = 这个电路是组合式的；其输出仅取决于当前输入。


一般过去时:
The design was combinational, ensuring speed. = 设计是组合式的，确保速度。
The engineer confirmed the circuit was combinational. = 工程师确认电路是组合式的。


现在完成时:
We have implemented a combinational logic solution. = 我们已经实现了一个组合逻辑解决方案。
They have successfully tested the combinational circuit. = 他们已经成功测试了组合电路。


过去完成时:
They had already determined the circuit was combinational before testing. = 他们在测试之前已经确定电路是组合式的。
The team had designed a combinational system for efficiency. = 团队设计了一个组合系统以提高效率。


将来时:
We will use a combinational approach for this project. = 我们将在本项目中使用组合方法。
The new design will be purely combinational. = 新设计将完全是组合式的。


虚拟语气:
If it were a combinational circuit, the output would be instantaneous. = 如果它是组合电路，输出将是瞬时的。
I wish the design were more combinational for better performance. = 我希望设计更组合化以获得更好的性能。


被动语态:
The data is processed by a combinational logic unit. = 数据由组合逻辑单元处理。
The circuit was designed to be purely combinational. = 电路设计为纯组合式。


疑问句:
Is this circuit combinational or sequential? = 这个电路是组合式的还是时序式的？
Is the system's logic entirely combinational? = 系统的逻辑完全是组合式的吗？


否定句:
The circuit is not combinational; it has memory. = 该电路不是组合式的；它有存储器。
The design is not purely combinational; it incorporates sequential elements. = 该设计并非纯组合式；它包含时序元件。


PHRASE->
combinational logic = 组合逻辑
combinational circuit = 组合电路
combinational optimization = 组合优化
combinational array = 组合阵列
combinational synthesis = 组合综合
