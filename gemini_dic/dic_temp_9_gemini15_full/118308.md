mercury: /ˈmɜːrkjʊri/ /ˈmɜːrkjəri/ | n. |水星；汞；水银；快信；信使|

英文解析:Mercury has several meanings.  It can refer to the planet Mercury, the smallest and closest planet to the sun in our solar system. It also refers to the chemical element mercury (Hg), a heavy, silvery-white metal that is liquid at room temperature, also known as quicksilver.  Furthermore, "mercury" can be used figuratively to refer to a messenger or a swift courier, reflecting the Roman god Mercury's role as a messenger.

例句:
The planet Mercury is very close to the sun. = 水星离太阳很近。

Mercury is a toxic heavy metal. = 汞是一种有毒重金属。


近义词:quicksilver (for the element), messenger, courier

反义词:  (No direct antonyms, depending on the context.  For the planet, perhaps "Jupiter" (as a contrasting large planet). For the element,  a non-metallic liquid could be considered an indirect antonym, but there isn't a single perfect opposite.)
