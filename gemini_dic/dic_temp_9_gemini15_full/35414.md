词源:

The word "co-ordinated" comes from the verb "coordinate," which itself is derived from the Latin word "coordinatus," a past participle of "coordinare."  "Co-" is a prefix meaning "together," and "ordinare" means "to arrange" or "to put in order."  Therefore, the word's root signifies the act of arranging or putting things together in an orderly manner.
