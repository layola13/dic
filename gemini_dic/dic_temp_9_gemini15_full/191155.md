The word "scard" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  Perhaps "scared," "scarred," or another word entirely?  Please double-check your spelling.
* **A slang term or neologism:**  It might be a newly coined word, a regional dialect word, or slang used within a specific community.  More context is needed.
* **A proper noun:** It might be a name or abbreviation.

To provide the analysis you requested, I need the correct spelling or more information about the context in which you encountered this word.
