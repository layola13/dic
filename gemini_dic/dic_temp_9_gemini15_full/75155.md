词源:
The word "fritter" ultimately derives from the Old French word "frire," meaning "to fry."  This refers to the small, fried pieces of food which were considered insignificant and easily wasted.  The sense of wasting something small and insignificant gradually evolved into the modern meaning of wasting time or resources.
