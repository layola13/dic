reflectibility: /ˌrɪˌflɛktəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 反射性；可反射性 | The ability of a surface to reflect light or other radiation.  This property is crucial in various fields, including optics, materials science, and astronomy.  For example, the high reflectibility of a mirror allows it to produce a clear image. | The mirror's high reflectibility is essential for its function.  = 这面镜子的高反射性对其功能至关重要。 The reflectibility of the metal surface was tested under various wavelengths. = 金属表面的反射率在不同波长下进行了测试。 | reflectivity, reflectance | absorptivity
