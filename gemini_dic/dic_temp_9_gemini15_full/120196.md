词源:
The word "minefield" is a compound word.  "Mine" refers to an explosive device buried underground, and "field" indicates an area of land.  The term thus literally describes an area containing mines. Its figurative use developed naturally from the literal meaning, extending to any situation fraught with hidden dangers.
