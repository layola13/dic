premonopolies: /ˌpriːməˈnɑːpəliz/ | n. | 预先垄断；先发垄断 |  A premonopoly is a situation where a company or group gains control over a market or resource before significant competition arises, often through early innovation, strategic acquisitions, or regulatory capture.  It establishes a dominant position that makes it difficult for later entrants to compete effectively.  This can lead to higher prices, reduced innovation, and less consumer choice. | The early railroads enjoyed premonopolies in many areas, controlling transportation and setting prices. | 近义词: early dominance, first-mover advantage, market dominance | 反义词: free competition, open market
