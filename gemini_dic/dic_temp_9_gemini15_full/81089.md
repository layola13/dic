This request is impossible to fulfill completely as the provided example is for the word "what," while the prompt asks for analysis of "{gram's}".  "{gram's}" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a shortened, informal version of a word or phrase. To provide an analysis, I need clarification on what "{gram's}" is intended to represent.


For example, it could be:

* **Gram's (as in possessive of "gram"):** This would refer to something belonging to a gram (a unit of weight).  In this case, it would be a noun.  The analysis would be straightforward but would lack the extensive grammatical examples provided in the template.

* **A misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of other words like "gram's stain," "grammar's," etc.  This requires knowing the intended word.

* **Informal abbreviation:** It might be a shortened informal version of a phrase.  Context is crucial here.

Please provide the correct spelling or the intended meaning of "{gram's}" to receive a proper analysis following the requested format.
