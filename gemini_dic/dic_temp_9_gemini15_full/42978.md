词源:  The word "coveted" comes from the Middle English word "coveiten," meaning "to desire greatly." This, in turn, derives from the Old French word "coveiter," ultimately from the Vulgar Latin *cupiditare, a frequentative of *cupīre, meaning "to desire."  The root is related to the Latin word "cupidus," meaning "desirous."
