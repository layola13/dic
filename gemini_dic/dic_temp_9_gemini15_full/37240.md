词源:  The word "comforting" derives from the verb "comfort," which itself has Old French origins ("conforter").  This Old French word further traces back to the Latin "comfortare," meaning "to strengthen," composed of "com-" (together) and "fortis" (strong).  Thus, the original sense implied strengthening or supporting someone emotionally or physically.  The modern sense of "comforting" retains this core idea of providing strength and easing distress.
