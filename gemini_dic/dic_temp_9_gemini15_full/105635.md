词源:

The term "king hit" originated in Australia and New Zealand.  While the precise etymology is debated, it's likely a descriptive term reflecting the sudden, powerful, and often decisive nature of the attack, similar to a knockout punch from a boxing champion ("king" implying dominance or a powerful blow). The term gained prominence due to its use in reporting instances of violence, especially those involving alcohol and one-punch attacks.  It highlights the unfair and unexpected nature of the assault.
