词源:
The word "sectioned" comes from the noun "section," which in turn derives from the Latin word "sectio," meaning "a cutting," "a division," or "a part."  The suffix "-ed" indicates the past participle, transforming the noun into an adjective describing something that has been cut or divided into sections.
