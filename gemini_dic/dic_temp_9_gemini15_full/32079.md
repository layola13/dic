The word "cheese" has origins in Old English "cēse," which is ultimately derived from Proto-Germanic *kāsiō.  The etymology connects it to similar words for cheese across various Germanic languages.  The root likely goes even further back to a Proto-Indo-European word related to the process of curdling milk.
