词源:

The phrase "of a sort" originates from the Old English "on sōþe," meaning "in truth" or "truly." Over time, the meaning shifted to imply a qualified or partial truth, leading to its current usage. The "sort" refers to a category or kind, implying the subject belongs to that category but only to a limited extent.
