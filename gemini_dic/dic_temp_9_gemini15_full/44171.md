词源:
The word "criticizing" comes from the Middle French word "critiquer," which itself is derived from the Greek word "kritikos," meaning "able to judge," or "critical."  The root is "krinein," meaning "to separate," "to decide," or "to judge."  Thus, the core meaning revolves around the act of discerning, judging, and evaluating something.
