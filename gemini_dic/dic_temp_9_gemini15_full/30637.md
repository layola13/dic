词源:
The word "ceremony" comes from the Old French word "ceremonie," which in turn derives from the Latin word "caerimonia." The Latin word's exact meaning is uncertain, but it likely referred to sacred rites and practices.  The evolution of the word shows a shift from its primarily religious connotations in Latin to its broader use encompassing formal events in modern English.
