词源:  The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively) and "tinseled" (past participle of "tinsel," meaning to decorate with tinsel).  "Tinsel" itself originates from the Old French "tinsel," possibly related to "étincelle" (spark).  It originally referred to a glittering metallic material used for decoration.
