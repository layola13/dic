词源: From dunce + -dom.  "Dunce" itself originates from the name of John Duns Scotus (c. 1266 – 1308), a medieval scholastic philosopher. Although highly regarded in his time, his philosophy was later misinterpreted and ridiculed, leading to the adoption of "dunce" as a term for a stupid person.  The suffix "-dom" indicates a state, condition, or realm.
