词源：

The word "correspondents" originates from the verb "correspond," which comes from the Old French word "correspondre," meaning "to agree, correspond, answer."  This in turn comes from the Latin "correspondēre," formed from "cor-" (together, with) and "respondēre" (to answer). Thus, the original meaning is linked to the act of answering or agreeing. The noun form "correspondents" evolved to describe individuals who engage in this act, particularly through written communication or reporting.
