USAGE->

This word is an adverb, and its usage is primarily within philosophical, mathematical, and logical discussions.  It describes how a conclusion or system is reached or built. Because it's a relatively uncommon word, providing examples of it in various grammatical tenses is not particularly illustrative of its meaning. The core concept is the *lack* of axiomatic foundation.  Therefore, focusing on showing the word in different sentence structures would be misleading and less helpful than providing contextual examples that highlight its meaning.
