replicatory: /ˈreplɪkətɔːri/ | adj. | 复制的；与复制相关的 | Relating to or involving replication; capable of being replicated.  The term often refers to the process of creating an exact copy of something, particularly in biological contexts such as DNA replication. |

例句：

The study focused on the replicatory mechanisms of the virus.  这项研究关注病毒的复制机制。

The replicatory fidelity of DNA polymerase is crucial for maintaining genetic stability. DNA聚合酶的复制保真度对于维持遗传稳定性至关重要。


近义词：duplicative, reproductive, copying

反义词：unique, original, non-reproductive


词源:  Derived from "replicate" + "-ory,"  "-ory" being a suffix forming adjectives meaning "of or relating to" or "characterized by."  "Replicate" itself comes from the Latin "replicare," meaning "to fold back," "to repeat," or "to copy."
