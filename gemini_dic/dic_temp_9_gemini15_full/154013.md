词源:  The word "performabilities" is derived from the verb "perform" and the suffix "-abilities," indicating the capacity or potential for something to be performed.  The root "perform" has Latin origins, combining "per" (through, thoroughly) and "forma" (form, shape).  Thus, the word ultimately relates to the idea of carrying something out or bringing something into being.
