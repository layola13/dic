英文解析：A presupposition is something that must be true in order for a statement to be true or meaningful. It's an underlying assumption that isn't explicitly stated but is nonetheless necessary for the statement to make sense.  Unlike implications, which are things that follow logically from a statement, presuppositions are things that must be true *before* the statement can even be evaluated.  They are often implicit and can be revealed by testing the statement's meaning under different conditions.

例句：

The statement "The king of France is bald" presupposes that there is a king of France.


The sentence "John regrets that he quit his job" presupposes that John quit his job.


近义词和反义词的进一步说明:

近义词：

* assumption:  A belief accepted as true without proof.  The difference lies in the context; presuppositions are specifically tied to the meaning and truth conditions of a statement, while assumptions are broader and can be held without a specific statement being involved.
* premise: A statement or proposition from which another is inferred or follows as a conclusion. Presuppositions are often underlying premises, but premises can be explicit while presuppositions are typically implicit.
* pre-condition: A condition that must be met before something else can happen.  This is closely related, highlighting the necessary condition for the statement's validity.

反义词:

* conclusion: A judgment or decision reached after consideration. This is the opposite because presuppositions are assumptions *before* any consideration or conclusion.
* result: Something that happens as a consequence of something else.  This is the opposite because presuppositions are prior to the result or outcome of a statement.


词源：

The word "presupposition" comes from the prefix "pre-" (before) + "supposition" (an assumption or belief).  "Supposition" itself comes from the Latin word "suppositus," meaning "placed under" or "assumed."  Therefore, a presupposition is an assumption placed before something else.
