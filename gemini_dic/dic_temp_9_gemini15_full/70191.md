fibrinogens:/faɪˈbrɪnədʒənz/ | n. |纤维蛋白原 | A group of glycoproteins found in blood plasma that are essential for blood clotting.  When activated, they convert into fibrin, forming a mesh-like structure that traps blood cells and platelets, stopping bleeding. | Example:  High levels of fibrinogens can increase the risk of blood clots. 高水平的纤维蛋白原会增加血栓的风险。  The doctor ordered a blood test to check the patient's fibrinogen levels. 医生下令进行血液检查以检查病人的纤维蛋白原水平。|近义词：clotting factors, coagulation factors |反义词： (no direct antonym, but low fibrinogen levels can lead to impaired clotting)
