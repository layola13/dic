obstruent:/ˈɒbstrʊənt/| /ˈɑːbstrʊənt/| n. adj.|阻塞物；闭塞音|A sound produced with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract, such as a stop or fricative consonant.  An obstruent is any consonant sound that creates an obstruction of airflow in the vocal tract. This contrasts with sonorants, which are produced with relatively open airflow.|The /p/ in "pin" is an obstruent because it involves a complete closure of the lips.  The /f/ in "fin" is also an obstruent, as it involves partial closure creating friction.|近义词：blockage, impediment, consonant|反义词：sonorant


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in linguistic contexts and does not have typical grammatical usages like a verb such as "to be."  Therefore, standard grammatical tenses (present, past, future etc.) are not applicable.  Instead, examples will focus on its usage in describing sounds.

Example 1 (describing a sound):
The voiceless alveolar stop /t/ is a common obstruent in English. = 英語中，清齒齦塞音/t/是一個常見的阻塞音。


Example 2 (comparing sound types):
Obstruents, unlike sonorants, involve significant airflow restriction. = 與濁音不同，阻塞音會顯著地限制氣流。
