词源:

The word "sentimentalistic" is derived from the adjective "sentimental," which itself comes from the French word "sentimental," ultimately from the Latin word "sentire," meaning "to feel."  The suffix "-istic" is added to denote an excessive or characteristic quality.  Therefore, "sentimentalistic" emphasizes an exaggerated or overly dramatic display of sentiment.
