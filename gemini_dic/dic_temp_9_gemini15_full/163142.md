USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't naturally lend itself to conjugation across verb tenses.  The usage depends on the context of the command being prepared.  Examples would show the command *following* the precommand, not the precommand itself changing tense.

The precommand initializes the printer; the print command then sends the document. 预指令初始化打印机；然后打印命令发送文档。

Example with a following command in past simple:
The precommand set the target coordinates; the fire command was then executed. 预指令设置了目标坐标；然后执行了发射命令。
