词源:  Derived from the word "deformed," which itself comes from the Old French "deforme" (meaning "misshapen") and ultimately from the Latin "deformare" (to disfigure, alter the form of), a compound of "de-" (away from) and "formare" (to form, shape).  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix denoting a state or quality.
