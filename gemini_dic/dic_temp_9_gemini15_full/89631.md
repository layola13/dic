词源:

The word "hookable" is derived from the verb "hook," which ultimately comes from the Old English word "hōc," meaning "hook."  The "-able" suffix is a common English suffix that forms adjectives meaning "capable of being" or "worthy of being." Therefore, "hookable" literally means "capable of being hooked."  The figurative extension to mean "easily captivating" developed naturally from the literal meaning.
