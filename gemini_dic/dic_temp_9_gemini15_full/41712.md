词源:

The word "corroboratively" derives from the verb "corroborate," which comes from the Medieval Latin word "corroborare," meaning "to strengthen."  This, in turn, is composed of the prefix "con-" (together) and "roborare" (to strengthen), ultimately stemming from the Latin word "robur," meaning "strength" or "oak" (referring to the strength of oak wood).
