词源:  The word "icehouse" is a straightforward compound of "ice" and "house," reflecting its simple function as a structure for storing ice.  The origins of ice storage itself go back to antiquity, with various cultures developing methods for preserving ice,  but the specific term "icehouse" likely emerged with the more widespread construction of dedicated structures for this purpose during the 18th and 19th centuries.
