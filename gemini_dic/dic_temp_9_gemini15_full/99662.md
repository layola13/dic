The word "interlibeled" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  However, we can speculate on possible intended meanings and offer analysis based on potential root words.

If "interlibeled" was intended to combine "inter-" and "libeled,"  we can analyze these components separately:

**inter-:** /ˈɪntər/ | prefix |  之间，相互 |  A prefix meaning "between," "among," "mutually," or "reciprocally." | Example: interact (相互作用)


**libeled:** /ˈlaɪbəld/ | v. (past tense of libel) | 诽谤，中伤 | To make a false and damaging statement about someone, typically in written form. | Example:  He was libeled in the newspaper article. (他在报纸文章中被诽谤了。)


Therefore, a potential interpretation of "interlibeled" could be:

* **Hypothetical Meaning:** Mutually libeled; each person libeled the other.  Or, perhaps, a libel that involved multiple parties.


**If we were to create a hypothetical entry for "interlibeled" based on this interpretation, it would look something like this (note that this is entirely speculative):**


interlibeled: /ˌɪntərˈlaɪbəld/ | v. (past participle) |  相互诽谤，互相中伤 |  To have mutually libeled each other; to have been involved in a libelous exchange between multiple parties. | Example: The two politicians interlibeled each other throughout the campaign. (两位政治家在整个竞选期间互相诽谤。) | Near Synonyms:  mutually slandered, reciprocally defamed | Antonyms:  praised, complimented


**USAGE (Hypothetical, based on the speculative meaning):**

This section would follow the format you provided, using examples of the hypothetical verb "interlibeled" in various tenses.  Since this word doesn't exist, providing examples would be entirely speculative and potentially misleading.


**PHRASE (Hypothetical):**

No common phrases using "interlibeled" would exist, as the word is not part of standard English.


It's crucial to remember that this entire entry is based on a hypothetical interpretation of a non-existent word.  If you encountered "interlibeled" in a specific context, providing that context would help determine the intended meaning and allow for a more accurate analysis.
