词源:

* **non-**:  Prefix meaning "not."
* **fortuitous**: Adjective meaning "happening by a lucky chance; fortunate."  This derives from the Latin word "fortuitus," which means "chance," related to "fors," meaning "luck" or "fate."


用法说明:

由于nonfortuitously是一个副词，它主要修饰动词，表示动作或事件发生的方式并非偶然。它通常用于强调事件的计划性和必然性，与偶然性或幸运性形成对比。
