The word "sife" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's possible:

* It's a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* It's a word from a very specialized field or dialect not widely known.
* It's a newly coined word or slang.
* It's a proper noun (name, place).

Please provide more context or clarify the spelling if you'd like me to help you further.
