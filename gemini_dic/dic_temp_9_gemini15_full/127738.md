词源:
From Latin *negotiāri ("to carry on business," "to trade"), from *nēgōtiātor ("businessman"), from nēgōtium ("business," "occupation," "affair"), from nēgō ("I deny, refuse, say no").  The original meaning reflects the idea of  "business dealings" often involving overcoming obstacles and reaching a compromise.
