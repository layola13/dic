词源:
From paraboloid + -ic. Paraboloid itself is from Parabola + -oid.  Parabola comes from the Greek word παραβολή (parabolé), meaning "application," "comparison," or "placing side by side."  The Greek mathematician Apollonius of Perga coined the term to describe a specific conic section.  The suffix "-ic" indicates relating to or characteristic of.
