/ˌhaɪpəˈmɑːdəstnisɪz/ | n. | 过分谦逊的诸多表现 |  The word "hypermodestnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, likely formed by combining "hyper" (meaning excessive or extreme), "modest" (meaning humble or unassuming), and the plural suffix "-nesses."  It suggests an excessive or exaggerated display of modesty, possibly to a point of being insincere or affected. There is no established definition or usage in standard dictionaries.  The word would likely be understood contextually, referring to multiple instances of extreme modesty. |  The numerous hypermodestnesses of the speaker made it difficult to understand his actual accomplishments. (说话人过分的谦逊使人难以了解他的实际成就。)  |  Excessive humility, affected modesty, false modesty |  Arrogance, boastfulness, pride |  n.
