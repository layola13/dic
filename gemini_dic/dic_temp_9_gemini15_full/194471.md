词源:
The word "self-respect" is a compound word formed from "self" and "respect."  "Self" is an Old English word meaning "one's own person." "Respect" comes from the Old French word "respect," ultimately derived from the Latin "respectus," meaning "regard," "attention," or "consideration."  The combination therefore literally means "regard for oneself."
