inflectionless:/ɪnˈflɛkʃənles/ | adj. | 无变化的；不变形的 | Lacking inflection; not inflected.  This term typically refers to languages or words that do not change their form to indicate grammatical function (such as tense, number, or case).  For example, some languages have fewer inflectional morphemes than others.  | Example:  The sentence structure of the language is largely inflectionless, relying instead on word order.  这个语言的句子结构很大程度上是无变化的，更多地依赖于词序。 | 近义词: uninflected, unchanging | 反义词: inflected, variable | 词性：形容词


USAGE->
There is no typical usage of "inflectionless" in the same way as a verb like "to be" or "to have."  The word describes a linguistic property.  Therefore, grammatical tenses, moods, or voices are not applicable.  Instead, examples will show its use in different contexts.

Example 1 (Describing a language):
Many languages are highly inflectional, while others are relatively inflectionless. = 许多语言都高度屈折，而另一些语言则相对无变化。

Example 2 (Describing a word):
In this context, the word "run" is used inflectionless as a noun. = 在这种语境下，“run”一词被用作无变化的名词。

Example 3 (Comparing linguistic features):
The verb system of this language is much more inflectionless than that of Latin. = 这种语言的动词系统比拉丁语的动词系统无变化得多。

Example 4 (Discussing morphology):
Inflectionless morphology is a characteristic of many isolating languages. = 无变化的形态学是许多孤立语的特征。

Example 5 (In a technical linguistic analysis):
The analysis reveals an inflectionless system of noun phrases. = 分析揭示了一个无变化的名词短语系统。
