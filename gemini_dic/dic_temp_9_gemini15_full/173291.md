词源:
The word "quasi-conventional" is a compound word.  "Quasi" is derived from Latin, meaning "as if," "seemingly," or "almost."  "Conventional" comes from the French "conventionnel," ultimately from the Latin "conventio," meaning "agreement" or "assembly."  Therefore, "quasi-conventional" literally means "almost conventional" or "resembling a convention."
