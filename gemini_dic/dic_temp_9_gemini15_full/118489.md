词源:
From "mesmerize," coined from the name of Franz Mesmer (1734-1815), an Austrian physician who developed a system of therapy based on "animal magnetism," a concept now considered pseudoscientific.  His techniques involved inducing a trance-like state in patients, thus contributing to the word's association with hypnosis.
