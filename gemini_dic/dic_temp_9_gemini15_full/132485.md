Word Origin:

The word "nondescriptiveness" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), the adjective "descriptive" (meaning "serving to describe"), and the suffix "-ness" (forming nouns of quality or state).  Therefore, it literally means "the state of not being descriptive."  "Descriptive" itself comes from the verb "describe," ultimately tracing back to the Latin word "describere," meaning "to write down, to delineate."
