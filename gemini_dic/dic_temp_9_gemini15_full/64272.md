equirotal: /ˌɛkwɪˈroʊtəl/ | adj. | 等角的，等旋转的 |  Equirotal refers to a system or process that involves equal rotations or angles.  It often describes geometric shapes or mechanical systems where rotations are balanced or uniform.  | Example: The equirotational design of the turbine blades ensures efficient energy transfer. 等角设计的涡轮叶片确保了高效的能量转换。 | 近义词：isogonal, equiangular | 反义词：unequirrotational (not a standard word, but conveys the opposite meaning) |  词性：形容词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The design is equirotational. = 这个设计是等角的。
