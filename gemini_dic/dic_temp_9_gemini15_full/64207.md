词源:

The word "equidistant" is derived from the prefix "equi-" meaning "equal," and the words "distant" and "distance".  "Distant" comes from the Old French word "distant," ultimately from the Latin "distans," present participle of "distare," meaning "to stand apart."

用法说明:

Equidistant is primarily used as an adjective to describe the spatial relationship between points or objects.  It implies a precise and equal measurement of distance.  The word is commonly used in mathematics, geometry, and other fields involving spatial relationships.  It can also be used in more figurative contexts to describe things that are equally balanced or spaced out in some way, though this is less common.
