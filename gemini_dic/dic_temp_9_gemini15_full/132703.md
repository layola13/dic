词源:

* **non-**:  prefix meaning "not"
* **distinguish**: verb meaning "to recognize or treat (someone or something) as different"
* **-able**: suffix making an adjective from a verb, meaning "capable of being"
* **-ly**: suffix turning an adjective into an adverb

The word is formed by combining the negative prefix "non-" with the adjective "distinguishable" (which itself is derived from the verb "distinguish"), and then adding the adverbial suffix "-ly".  Therefore, it literally means "not distinguishably."
