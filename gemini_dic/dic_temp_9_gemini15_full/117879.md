词源:
melodramatic  源自 melodrama (n.) + -ic (adj. suffix)

Melodrama itself comes from the Greek words  μέλος (melos, "song, melody") and δράμα (drama, "drama").  Originally, melodramas were plays that incorporated music, especially songs, to heighten the emotional impact.  Over time, the term came to refer to any excessively emotional or sentimental dramatic presentation.
