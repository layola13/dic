词源:  The word "restlessness" derives from the Old English word "rest," meaning "to remain,"  combined with the suffix "-lessness," indicating the absence of rest or a state of being without rest.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the feeling of anxiety and inability to relax associated with a lack of rest.
