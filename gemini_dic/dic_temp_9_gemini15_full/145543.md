The word "overcommon" is not a standard word in the English language.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a complete analysis following the requested format is impossible.  To provide analysis, we would need a valid English word.
