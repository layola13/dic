词源：

* **furrow:**  This noun means a long narrow trench in the ground, especially one made by a plow.  It also refers to a wrinkle or crease in the skin. Its origin is Old English *furh*, related to Old High German *fura* (furrow).

* **-less:** This suffix means "without" or "lacking."  It's of Old English origin, derived from *lēas*.

Therefore, *furrowless* literally means "without furrows."
