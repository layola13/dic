The word "dengues" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:** Perhaps you meant a different word, such as "dengue" (the name of a disease).  Or perhaps it's a proper noun, a name, or a word from another language.

2. **A neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a slang term, or a word used within a specific community or context.  Without more context, it's impossible to define.

3. **A typographical error:**  A simple typing mistake could have produced this word.


To provide a proper analysis in the requested format, please provide the correct spelling or context in which you encountered this word.  If it's a misspelling of "dengue," I can provide information on that word.
