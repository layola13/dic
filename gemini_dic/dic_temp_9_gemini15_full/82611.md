The word "guas" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:** Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
2. **It's a slang term or regional dialect word:** If so, providing more context (where you encountered the word) would be helpful.
3. **It's a word from another language:** If it's from a different language, please specify the language so I can attempt a translation and analysis.


Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis. Please clarify the word or provide additional context.
