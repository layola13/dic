The word "mixtion" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, part of speech, meaning, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide a response in the requested format.  It's possible there's a misspelling or it's a very obscure or technical term.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer more assistance.
