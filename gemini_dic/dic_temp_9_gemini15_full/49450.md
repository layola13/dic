deltafication:/ˌdɛltəfɪˈkeɪʃən/| n. |三角洲形成；成三角洲作用|The process by which a river deposits sediment to form a delta.  This involves the interplay of fluvial processes (river flow), marine processes (ocean currents and tides), and sediment characteristics.  The shape and size of the delta are influenced by a variety of factors, including sediment supply, river discharge, wave energy, and tidal range. |例句：The deltafication of the Mississippi River has created a vast and fertile wetland. 密西西比河的三角洲形成创造了一个广阔而肥沃的湿地。

The deltafication of the Nile River has been significantly impacted by human activities. 尼罗河的三角洲形成受到了人类活动的重要影响。|近义词：delta formation, alluvial deposition |反义词：erosion, degradation
