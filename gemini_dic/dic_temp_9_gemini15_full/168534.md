procarcinogen:/ˌproʊˈkɑːrsɪnədʒən/ | n. |促癌剂，潜在致癌物 | A substance that is not itself carcinogenic but can be converted into a carcinogen by metabolic processes in the body.  | Example:  Certain chemicals found in cigarette smoke are procarcinogens, meaning they require metabolic activation to become carcinogenic. 某些香烟烟雾中的化学物质是促癌剂，这意味着它们需要代谢激活才能变成致癌物。 |近义词：precarcinogen, potential carcinogen |反义词：anticarcinogen


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The liver processes many procarcinogens. = 肝脏处理许多促癌剂。
Scientists study how procarcinogens become carcinogens. = 科学家研究促癌剂如何变成致癌物。


一般过去时:
Researchers identified a new procarcinogen in the study. = 研究人员在研究中发现了一种新的促癌剂。
The experiment showed how a procarcinogen was activated. = 实验显示了促癌剂是如何被激活的。


现在完成时:
Studies have shown the link between procarcinogens and cancer. = 研究已经表明了促癌剂与癌症之间的联系。
Scientists have identified many different procarcinogens. = 科学家已经鉴定了许多不同的促癌剂。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, this substance was not known as a procarcinogen. = 在发现之前，这种物质并不被认为是促癌剂。
They had already tested several compounds for procarcinogenic activity. = 他们已经测试了几种化合物的促癌活性。


将来时:
Future research will focus on identifying more procarcinogens. = 未来的研究将集中在鉴定更多促癌剂上。
Scientists will investigate how the procarcinogen is metabolized. = 科学家将研究促癌剂是如何代谢的。


虚拟语气:
If this substance were a procarcinogen, it would be a serious concern. = 如果这种物质是促癌剂，那将是一个严重的问题。
It is important that we carefully evaluate potential procarcinogens. = 我们仔细评估潜在的促癌剂非常重要。


被动语态:
Many procarcinogens are metabolized in the liver. = 许多促癌剂在肝脏中代谢。
The procarcinogen was found to be activated by enzyme X. = 发现促癌剂被酶X激活。


疑问句:
Is this compound a known procarcinogen? = 这种化合物是已知的促癌剂吗？
What are the metabolic pathways of this procarcinogen? = 这种促癌剂的代谢途径是什么？


否定句:
This substance is not a procarcinogen. = 这种物质不是促癌剂。
The study did not find any evidence of procarcinogenic activity. = 该研究没有发现任何促癌活性的证据。


PHRASE->
procarcinogen activation = 促癌剂活化
procarcinogen metabolism = 促癌剂代谢
potential procarcinogen = 潜在促癌剂
identification of procarcinogens = 促癌剂的鉴定
procarcinogen bioactivation = 促癌剂生物活化
