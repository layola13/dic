* It's a very uncommon or obsolete word:  If you encountered this word in a specific context (e.g., a very old text), providing that context might help in determining its meaning.
* It's a neologism or slang:  It might be a newly coined word or a slang term not yet widely recognized.  Again, context is crucial.
