词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost."
* **eternal**: From Latin *aeternalis*, from *aevum* ("age," "lifetime").

The word combines the sense of "almost" or "approaching" with the concept of "eternal," creating a nuanced term that suggests a very long duration but not true infinity.
