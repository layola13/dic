plastide:/ˈplæstɪd/| n.|质体|A plastid is a membrane-bound organelle found in the cells of plants and algae. Plastids are involved in various functions, including photosynthesis, storage of starch and other nutrients, and the synthesis of certain molecules.  Different types of plastids exist, each specialized for a particular function.  For example, chloroplasts are plastids that carry out photosynthesis.|Chloroplasts are a type of plastid that contains chlorophyll and carries out photosynthesis.  The leaves of plants are green because of the chlorophyll in their chloroplasts. |近义词：organelle|反义词:None
