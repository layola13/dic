/ˌoʊvərˈlɒdʒɪkəlˌnɛsɪz/ | n. |过度逻辑性；过度理性 |The word "overlogicalnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a nonce word, formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" (indicating plurality of qualities) to "overlogical," which itself is a combination of "over-" (excessive) and "logical" (relating to logic or reasoning). It implies an excessive or unreasonable adherence to logic, potentially to the point of absurdity or impracticality.  There are no standard synonyms or antonyms, as the word is not established in the lexicon. The usage would be highly context-dependent and would likely be used in a humorous or satirical context to describe someone overly reliant on strict logic or someone who takes things too literally.  Because it's a nonce word, providing grammar examples is not possible in the way it is for regular words.


例句：His arguments were filled with such overlogicalnesses that they lost all persuasive power.  他的论点充满了如此过度的逻辑性，以至于失去了所有的说服力。
