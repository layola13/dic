precession:/prɪˈsɛʃən/| n.| 岁差；旋进；优先；领先 | The slow, conical movement of Earth's axis of rotation, which is caused by the gravitational pull of the sun and moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. It completes one cycle in approximately 26,000 years.  | Example: The precession of the equinoxes causes the seasons to shift slightly over time.  岁差现象导致季节随时间推移略有变化。| 近义词：advance, precedence, priority | 反义词：recession, regression


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The Earth's axis experiences precession. = 地球的轴线正在经历岁差。
Precession affects the timing of the seasons. = 岁差影响季节的时间。

一般过去时:
Scientists observed the precession of the equinoxes. = 科学家们观测到春分点的岁差。
The ancient astronomers understood precession. = 古代天文学家理解岁差。

现在完成时:
Astronomers have measured the rate of precession. = 天文学家们已经测量了岁差的速率。
Researchers have studied precession for centuries. = 研究人员们已经研究岁差几个世纪了。

过去完成时:
Before the discovery of precession, the celestial mechanics were not fully understood. = 在发现岁差之前，天体力学并没有被完全理解。
They had not anticipated the effect of precession on their calculations. = 他们没有预料到岁差对他们计算的影响。


将来时:
Future observations will further refine our understanding of precession. = 未来的观测将进一步完善我们对岁差的理解。
The precession will continue to affect the Earth's climate. = 岁差将继续影响地球的气候。


虚拟语气:
If the Earth were perfectly spherical, there would be no precession. = 如果地球是完美的球体，就不会有岁差。
I wish I had understood precession earlier in my studies. = 我希望在我学习的早期就理解岁差。


被动语态:
The rate of precession is precisely measured by astronomers. = 岁差的速率由天文学家精确测量。
The effects of precession are felt on Earth's climate. = 岁差的影响在地球的气候中感受到。


疑问句:
What causes the precession of the equinoxes? = 什么导致春分点的岁差？
How long does it take for one full cycle of precession? = 一个完整的岁差周期需要多长时间？


否定句:
The Earth's rotation is not perfectly stable; it undergoes precession. = 地球的自转并不完全稳定；它经历着岁差。
Early astronomers did not fully understand the phenomenon of precession. = 早期天文学家并没有完全理解岁差现象。


PHRASE->
axial precession:  轴向岁差
lunisolar precession:  日月岁差
precession of the equinoxes:  分点岁差
general precession: 一般岁差
precession of the perihelion: 近日点岁差
