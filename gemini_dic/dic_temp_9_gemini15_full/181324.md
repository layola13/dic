词源:

The word "reinterventions" is formed from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back"), the verb "intervene" (meaning "to come between; to interfere; to take action to improve a situation"), and the suffix "-tions" (forming a noun meaning "the action or process of").  Therefore, it literally means "the act of intervening again."  The root of "intervene" is Latin: *inter* (between) + *venire* (to come).
