词源:
The word "sap" ultimately derives from the Old French "sape," meaning "sap" (the juice of a plant). Its meaning evolved to encompass the sense of vitality and later, the weakening or draining of vitality.  The sense of a foolish person is a later development, likely derived from the idea of someone being easily manipulated or "drained" of their good sense.
