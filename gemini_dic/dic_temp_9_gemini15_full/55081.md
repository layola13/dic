The word is derived from "disreputable" (not respectable, shameful) + "-ness" (suffix indicating a state or quality) + "-es" (plural suffix).  "Disreputable" itself comes from "dis-" (negative prefix) + "reputable" (having a good reputation).  The ultimate roots lie in the Latin "reputare" (to think, consider).
