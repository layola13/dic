pseudobedding:/ˈsuːdoʊˌbɛdɪŋ/ | n. |假层理，假成层构造 | False bedding or cross-bedding is a sedimentary structure where inclined layers are deposited within a larger horizontal bed.  This is formed by the movement of sediment in a current, such as a river or wind. The inclined layers are called cross-strata.  | The sandstone showed clear evidence of pseudobedding, indicating a depositional environment with significant water currents. 砂岩显示出明显的假层理迹象，表明沉积环境存在明显的洋流。|cross-bedding, cross-stratification |massive bedding, parallel bedding|名词
