/ˌoʊvər dɪˈprɛs/ | adj. |过度压抑的；极度沮丧的 | Extremely depressed; overwhelmed by sadness or despair.  This word is not a standard dictionary entry and is likely a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively) and "depress."  Therefore, a direct etymological tracing is not possible in the traditional sense. However, we can analyze its components. "Over-" comes from Old English *ofer, meaning "over, above," and "depress" comes from Latin *de- ("down") + *premere ("to press"). |  He felt overdepressed after the loss of his job and his home. 他在失去工作和家园后感到极度沮丧。  She was overdepressed and needed professional help. 她过度沮丧，需要专业人士的帮助。 | extremely sad, deeply unhappy, despondent | elated, cheerful, joyful | adjective
