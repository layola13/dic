词源:
The word "constitutionals" is derived from the word "constitution," meaning the physical state of someone's body, especially in terms of health and strength.  Taking a walk was seen as beneficial to one's constitution, hence the term "constitutionals" to describe such walks.  The usage gradually shifted to emphasize the health benefits of the walk.
