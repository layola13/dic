词源:

The word "demonized" comes from the noun "demon," ultimately derived from the Greek word "δαίμων" (daimōn), meaning a spirit, deity, or fate.  The suffix "-ized" indicates the process of making something into a demon or treating it as such.  The transformation of the meaning from a neutral "spirit" to a negative "evil spirit" happened over time.
