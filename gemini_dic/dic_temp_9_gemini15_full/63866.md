epigynous:/ɪˈpɪdʒɪnəs/| adj. |子房上位花的；子房下位的|  Referring to a flower in which the receptacle (the part of the flower stalk where the floral organs are attached) is fused to the ovary, resulting in the other floral parts (sepals, petals, stamens) appearing to arise from the top of the ovary.  This is in contrast to hypogynous flowers, where the receptacle is below the ovary. |例句：The apple flower is an example of an epigynous flower, where the sepals, petals, and stamens appear to be attached above the ovary. 苹果花就是一个子房下位花的例子，花萼、花瓣和雄蕊看起来都着生在子房之上。

The ovary in an epigynous flower is inferior, meaning it is below the attachment point of the other floral parts.  This is different from a hypogynous flower, where the ovary is superior and sits above the attachment point of the other floral parts.  |近义词：inferior-ovaried |反义词：hypogynous
