词源:
The word "lagnappe" is of French origin, derived from the French word "lagniappe," which itself has a somewhat uncertain etymology.  One theory suggests it comes from the Spanish word "la niña," meaning "the girl," referring to a young girl who might have given away an extra item.  Another possibility involves a corruption of a Choctaw word.  Regardless of its precise origin, it has been used in Louisiana and other parts of the southern United States for centuries.
