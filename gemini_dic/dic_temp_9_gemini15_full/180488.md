regelling:/rɪˈɡɛlɪŋ/| v.|再统治；重新管理 |  The word "regelling" is not a standard English word. It's likely a neologism or a misspelling.  It seems to be formed from "re-" (again) and "gelling" (to become or make firm or solid).  Therefore, a possible meaning could be "to rule again" or "to re-establish control," or, in a more metaphorical sense, "to solidify again" or "to re-establish order." However, without a clear context, its meaning remains ambiguous.  There are no standard dictionaries that list this word. | Example sentences cannot be provided because the word is not established. | 近义词: (depending on intended meaning)  reruling, re-establishing,  reorganizing | 反义词: (depending on intended meaning) overthrowing, destabilizing | 动词
