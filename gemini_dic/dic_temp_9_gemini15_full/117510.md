词源:
The word "meekly" is derived from the adjective "meek," which traces back to the Old English word "mēok," meaning "mild," "gentle," or "humble."  This Old English word is related to the Old High German "miuh," meaning "soft," and ultimately shares a common Germanic ancestor.  The "-ly" suffix is an adverbial ending, transforming the adjective "meek" into the adverb "meekly."
