词源:
The word "housemasterships" is derived from "housemaster" + "-ship".  "Housemaster" itself combines "house" (referring to a residential unit in a boarding school) and "master" (implying authority and responsibility). The suffix "-ship" denotes a state, condition, office, or skill.  Therefore, "housemasterships" signifies the positions or roles of housemasters.
