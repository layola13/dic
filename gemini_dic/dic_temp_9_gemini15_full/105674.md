词源:

The word "kingpin" originally referred to a large pin or bolt that acts as a central pivot in a machine or structure, particularly in bowling.  Its figurative use, referring to a central and crucial person, evolved from this mechanical meaning, highlighting the importance of the kingpin in holding everything together.  The "king" part emphasizes its dominance and crucial role.
