词源:
The word "preindulge" is a relatively modern coinage, formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") with the verb "indulge" (meaning "to allow oneself to enjoy a luxury or pleasure").  Therefore, its etymology traces back to the Latin roots of "pre-" and "indulgere" (to be kind, to yield).
