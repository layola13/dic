celluloses:/ˈsɛljuˌloʊsiz/| n. |纤维素（复数）|Celluloses are complex carbohydrates consisting of chains of glucose units, forming the main structural component of plant cell walls.  They are also found in some algae and bacteria.  The term "celluloses" is the plural form of "cellulose".  While technically correct, it is less commonly used than "cellulose" which is often used to refer to the general material. |例句：The researchers studied the various types of celluloses found in different plant species. 研究人员研究了不同植物物种中发现的各种纤维素。

The chemical properties of these celluloses were analyzed.  这些纤维素的化学性质被分析了。|近义词：cellulose (singular), plant fibers|反义词：无

词源:
The word "celluloses" is derived from the word "cellulose," which in turn comes from the French word "cellulose," coined in the early 19th century from "cellule" (cell) + "-ose" (a suffix used to denote a carbohydrate).  The "-es" ending indicates the plural form.
