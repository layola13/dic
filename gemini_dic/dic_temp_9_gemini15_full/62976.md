enodi:/ˈɛnoʊdaɪ/| n. | 节点，结点；（植物的）节；（解剖学）结节 | A node is a point in a network or a system where lines or pathways intersect or branch. In botany, a node is the part of a stem from which one or more leaves emerge. In anatomy, a node is a knot or swelling.  |例句：The network has several key nodes.  这个网络有几个关键节点。

The plant's nodes were spaced evenly along the stem. 植物的节沿着茎均匀分布。|近义词：knot, joint, point |反义词：internode (植物学)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The network has many nodes. = 这个网络有很多节点。
This plant shows clear nodes along its stem. = 这株植物的茎上有清晰的节。


一般过去时:
The technician identified the faulty node. = 技术人员找到了有故障的节点。
The botanist carefully examined the nodes of the specimen. = 植物学家仔细检查了标本的节。


现在完成时:
We have added several new nodes to the network. = 我们已经向网络添加了几个新节点。
The gardener has noticed the increased spacing between nodes this year. = 园丁注意到今年节间距增加了。


过去完成时:
They had already removed the damaged node before I arrived. = 我到达之前他们已经移除了损坏的节点。
The researchers had identified the specific nodes responsible for the disease before publishing their findings. = 研究人员在发表研究结果之前已经确定了导致该疾病的特定节点。


将来时:
We will install more nodes to improve network performance. = 我们将安装更多节点以提高网络性能。
The scientist predicts that the nodes will grow closer together under these conditions. = 科学家预测在这些条件下，节会长得更靠近。


虚拟语气:
If we had more nodes, the network would be more stable. = 如果我们有更多节点，网络就会更稳定。
If the nodes were closer together, the plant would likely be taller. = 如果节更靠近，植物可能会更高。


被动语态:
The nodes were carefully examined under a microscope. = 节点在显微镜下被仔细检查。
The new nodes are being installed by the IT team. = 新节点正在由IT团队安装。


疑问句:
How many nodes are there in this network? = 这个网络有多少节点？
Where are the nodes located on this plant stem? = 这株植物茎上的节位于何处？


否定句:
The network does not have enough nodes. = 这个网络没有足够的节点。
This plant does not show clearly defined nodes. = 这株植物没有显示出清晰的节。


PHRASE->
network node = 网络节点
data node = 数据节点
root node = 根节点
leaf node = 叶节点 (树状结构)
sensor node = 传感器节点
