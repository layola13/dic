词源:
The word "readmission's" is derived from the verb "readmit," which combines the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") with the verb "admit" (meaning "to allow entry").  The suffix "-ion" forms a noun, and the apostrophe-s indicates the plural possessive form.  Therefore, "readmission's" signifies the plural possessive instances of readmission.
