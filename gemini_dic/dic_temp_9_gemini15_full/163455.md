precontention:/ˌpriːkənˈtɛnʃən/| n. |预张力，预应力|The stress or tension applied to a material before it is subjected to a load.  It's used to improve the strength and stability of structures. |例句：The bridge was built using precontention in the concrete beams to increase their load-bearing capacity. 这座桥梁在混凝土梁中使用了预应力来提高其承重能力。  The precontention of the steel cables is crucial for the stability of the suspension bridge. 钢索的预张力对于吊桥的稳定性至关重要。|近义词： prestress, prestrain |反义词： slack, relaxation |名词


USAGE->

过去完成时:
The workers had already released the precontention. =工人们已经释放了预张力。
The inspectors had verified the precontention before the load test. =检查员在负载测试前已经验证了预张力。


将来时:
We will increase the precontention gradually. =我们将逐渐增加预张力。
The contractor will monitor the precontention throughout the process. =承包商将在整个过程中监测预张力。


虚拟语气:
If we had more precontention, the structure would be stronger. =如果我们有更大的预张力，结构将会更坚固。
It is crucial that the precontention is properly controlled. =预张力的正确控制至关重要。


被动语态:
