词源:

* **open:**  From Old English *open*, meaning "unclosed, not shut."  This further derives from Proto-Germanic *upan*, meaning "to open."

* **end:** From Old English *ende*, meaning "end, conclusion." This has roots in Proto-Germanic *andiz*, related to words meaning "extreme, limit."

* **-ed:**  Past participle suffix, indicating a quality or state.

* **-ness:**  Suffix forming abstract nouns indicating a state, quality, or condition.


Therefore, "open-endedness" literally means the "state of being open at the end," implying a lack of a fixed conclusion or predetermined outcome.
