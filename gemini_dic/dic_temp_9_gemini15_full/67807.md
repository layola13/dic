eyespot:/ˈaɪspɑːt/ | n. |眼点，眼斑 |A small, pigmented spot on the body of an organism, often serving as a simple eye or light-sensitive organ.  It typically contains photoreceptor cells that detect light direction and intensity, enabling the organism to orient itself towards or away from light. |例句：The single eyespot of the euglena allows it to move towards light. 单细胞藻类眼虫的单个眼点使它能够向光移动。

The larval stage of many marine invertebrates exhibit prominent eyespots. 许多海洋无脊椎动物的幼虫期都具有明显的色素斑。|近义词：ocellus, photosensitive spot |反义词：blind spot
