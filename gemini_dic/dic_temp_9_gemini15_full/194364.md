词源:
self- :  itself indicates that the focus is on oneself.
preoccupation: comes from "preoccupy," which means to dominate or fill someone's mind completely.  "Pre-" means before or in advance, and "occupy" means to fill or take up space or time. Thus, "preoccupation" means a state of being filled with thoughts or concerns, usually to an excessive degree.  The suffix "-tion" transforms the verb into a noun, denoting the state or action.
