词源:
The word "confectionary" ultimately derives from the Latin word "confectus," the past participle of "conficere," meaning "to make up," "to prepare," or "to accomplish."  Over time, "confectus" evolved into the Old French word "confiture," which referred to preserved fruits and sweets. This then led to the Middle English word "confection," and eventually to the modern "confectionary," referring both to the sweet goods themselves and the place where they are sold.
