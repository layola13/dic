myelin: /ˈmaɪəlɪn/ | n. |髓磷脂|A fatty white substance that forms a sheath around the axons of many nerves, especially in the brain and spinal cord; it enables vastly increased transmission speed of nerve impulses.|Myelin sheaths insulate nerve fibers and allow for faster transmission of electrical signals.  髓磷脂鞘绝缘神经纤维，并允许更快地传输电信号。|近义词：myelinated fiber|反义词：demyelination
