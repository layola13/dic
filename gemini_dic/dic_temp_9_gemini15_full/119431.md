microgravity: /ˌmaɪkroʊˈɡrævɪti/ | n. |微重力，近似失重|The condition in which the force of gravity is greatly reduced, such as that experienced by astronauts in orbit. It's not true weightlessness, as some gravitational pull still exists, but it's significantly less than on Earth's surface.  |Example:  Astronauts conduct many experiments in microgravity to study its effects on various materials and biological processes.  宇航员在微重力环境下进行许多实验，以研究其对各种材料和生物过程的影响。


Example: The International Space Station provides a unique environment for studying the effects of long-term microgravity on human health. 国际空间站为研究长期微重力对人体健康的影响提供了独特的环境。 |近义词：near-weightlessness, near zero gravity |反义词：normal gravity, terrestrial gravity |词性：名词
