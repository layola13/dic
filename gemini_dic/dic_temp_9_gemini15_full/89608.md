词源:

The word "hoodwinkable" is derived from the verb "hoodwink," which itself has a complex etymology.  While the exact origin isn't definitively settled, the most widely accepted theory links it to the obsolete word "hood," meaning a covering for the head (like a hood on a cloak), and "wink," meaning to shut the eyes or to deceive.  The combination suggests the act of covering someone's eyes to deceive them.  The "-able" suffix transforms the verb into an adjective, signifying capability or susceptibility.
