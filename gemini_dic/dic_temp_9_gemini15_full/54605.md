词源:
The word "dismay" comes from the Old French word "desmaier," which means "to faint, to lose courage."  It is formed from the prefix "des-" (meaning "to do away with," "remove," or "reverse") and the Old French word "maier," which is related to the Old English word "magan," meaning "to be able." The original meaning, therefore, involves the loss of ability or courage.  Over time, the meaning shifted to the feeling of discouragement and disappointment we understand today.
