molecularity:/ˌmɒlɪkjʊˈlærɪti/ /ˌmɑːlɪkjʊˈlærɪti/| n. |分子数；分子性 |The number of molecules that participate in an elementary reaction.  It describes the number of reactant molecules involved in a single step of a reaction mechanism.  For example, a unimolecular reaction involves only one molecule, a bimolecular reaction involves two molecules, and a termolecular reaction involves three molecules.  Termolecular reactions are rare. |例句：The molecularity of the reaction is two, indicating a bimolecular process.  = 该反应的分子数为二，表明这是一个双分子过程。

The molecularity of this reaction is three; it is a termolecular process. = 这个反应的分子性是三，这是一个三分子过程。|近义词：reaction order (although not directly interchangeable, as molecularity refers to the mechanism while reaction order refers to the rate law)|反义词：N/A|名词
