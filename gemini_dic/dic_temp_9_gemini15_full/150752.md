paracrystalline:/ˌpærəˈkrɪstəlaɪn/| adj.|准晶体；似晶体的|  Relating to or denoting a state of matter intermediate between crystalline and amorphous, characterized by a degree of order greater than that of an amorphous solid but less than that of a true crystal.  Paracrystalline structures exhibit short-range order but lack the long-range periodicity of true crystals. This state is often observed in polymers, liquid crystals, and some biological materials.| Example: The polymer exhibited a paracrystalline structure, showing some degree of order but not true crystallinity.|近义词：semicrystalline, partially crystalline|反义词：amorphous, crystalline
