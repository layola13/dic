non-extensive:/ˌnɒnɪkˈstɛnsɪv/| adj. |非广泛的；非广延的；非 extensive 的|Not exhibiting extensive properties;  referring to systems where the properties of the whole are not simply the sum of the properties of its parts.  This is often contrasted with extensive properties like volume or mass, which scale linearly with system size.| 例句：Entropy is a non-extensive quantity. 熵是一个非广延量。 The social impact of the event was non-extensive, affecting only a small community. 事件的社会影响并不广泛，只影响了一个小社区。|近义词：limited, restricted, localized|反义词：extensive, comprehensive, widespread
