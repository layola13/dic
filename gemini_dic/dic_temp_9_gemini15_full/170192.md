protostar:/ˈproʊtoʊstɑːr/|/ˈprəʊtəʊstɑːr/| n. |原恒星|A protostar is a very young star that is still in the process of formation.  It is a large, dense cloud of gas and dust that is collapsing under its own gravity.  As it collapses, the protostar heats up and begins to shine.  Eventually, the protostar will become a main-sequence star. |例句：The protostar continues to accrete mass from the surrounding molecular cloud. 原恒星继续从周围的分子云中吸积物质。

The protostar is still surrounded by a thick disk of gas and dust. 原恒星仍然被厚厚的尘埃气体盘所包围。|近义词：pre-main-sequence star, young stellar object |反义词：main-sequence star, giant star


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Protostars form in giant molecular clouds. = 原恒星形成于巨型分子云中。
A protostar gradually increases in temperature. = 原恒星的温度逐渐升高。

一般过去时:
Astronomers observed the protostar's evolution. = 天文学家观测了原恒星的演化。
The protostar collapsed under its own gravity. = 原恒星在自身引力作用下坍缩。

现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered many protostars. = 科学家们已经发现了许多原恒星。
The protostar has accreted significant mass. = 原恒星已经吸积了大量的物质。

过去完成时:
Before the protostar ignited, it was a cold cloud. = 在原恒星点燃之前，它是一团冷云。
The cloud had collapsed before forming a protostar. = 云团在形成原恒星之前已经坍缩了。

将来时:
This protostar will eventually become a star. = 这颗原恒星最终将变成一颗恒星。
The protostar will continue to grow in size. = 原恒星将继续增大。

虚拟语气:
If the protostar had more mass, it would become a giant star. = 如果原恒星质量更大，它将变成一颗巨星。
