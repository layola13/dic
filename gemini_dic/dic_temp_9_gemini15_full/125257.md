词源:
The word "multidwelling" is a compound word.  "Multi-" is a prefix meaning "many" or "multiple," derived from Latin "multus" (much, many). "Dwelling" is a noun meaning "a house, apartment, or other place of residence,"  from Old English "dwellan" (to live).  Therefore, "multidwelling" literally means "having many dwellings."
