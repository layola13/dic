The word "launcegaye" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or etymology resources.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a very obscure dialect, or a proper noun (like a place name) not widely known.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide the requested information, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about its origin and usage.
