词源:
The word "concupiscible" comes from the Late Latin word *concupiscibilis*, which is derived from the verb *concupiscere*, meaning "to desire eagerly," "to lust after."  *Concupiscere* itself is a combination of the prefix *con-* (meaning "together" or "intensively") and *cupiscere* (meaning "to desire").  Therefore, the root meaning points to a strong and intense desire, often with sexual connotations.
