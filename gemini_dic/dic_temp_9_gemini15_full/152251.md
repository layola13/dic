词源:

From the Latin *patronus*, meaning "protector," "advocate," or "sponsor."  The original sense of the English word was connected to the Roman system of patronage, where powerful individuals protected and supported clients.  Over time, the meaning evolved to include the sense of being a regular customer, and later, the negative connotation of condescending treatment.
