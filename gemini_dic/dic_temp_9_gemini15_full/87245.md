WORD ORIGIN->

The word is a compound of three elements:

* **hereto:**  This is an archaic adverb meaning "to this," "in this respect," or "until now." It's a contraction of "heretofore."
* **fore:**  An Old English word meaning "before."
* **time:**  The common English word for a period of duration.


Therefore, "heretoforetime" literally means "to this before time," effectively meaning "until this time."  The word's construction highlights the passing of time and the present moment as a boundary.
