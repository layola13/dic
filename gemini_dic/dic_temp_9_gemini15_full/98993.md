interabsorption: /ˌɪntəræbˈsɔːrpʃən/ | n. |互相吸收；相互吸收作用 | The process where two or more substances mutually absorb each other.  This often involves the incorporation of one substance into the structure of another.  The term is commonly used in physics and chemistry, particularly in contexts like the absorption of light or sound waves, or the mixing of liquids. | Example: The interabsorption of light in a dense fog reduces visibility.  = 浓雾中的光线相互吸收降低了能见度。 The interabsorption of different dye molecules can affect the final color of a fabric. = 不同染料分子的相互吸收会影响织物的最终颜色。 |近义词：mutual absorption, reciprocal absorption | 反义词：separation, segregation |  词性：名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "hello."  The grammatical structures below apply to sentences *using* "interabsorption," not to the word itself.


一般现在时:
The interabsorption of gases is a key process in atmospheric chemistry. = 气体的相互吸收是大气化学中的一个关键过程。
Interabsorption of light affects the color of the solution. = 光的相互吸收会影响溶液的颜色。

一般过去时:
The interabsorption of the two liquids was complete after several hours. = 两种液体在几个小时后完全相互吸收。
Scientists studied the interabsorption of energy in the experiment. = 科学家们在实验中研究了能量的相互吸收。

现在完成时:
Researchers have observed significant interabsorption of signals in the experiment. = 研究人员在实验中观察到了明显的信号相互吸收。
The system has shown a high degree of interabsorption of the components. = 该系统显示出组分的较高的相互吸收度。

过去完成时:
Before the reaction concluded, substantial interabsorption had occurred. = 在反应结束之前，已经发生了大量的相互吸收。
The scientists had already documented the interabsorption effects in their previous research. = 科学家们已经在之前的研究中记录了相互吸收效应。


将来时:
The experiment will demonstrate the interabsorption of electromagnetic waves. = 该实验将演示电磁波的相互吸收。
The new technology will allow for precise measurement of interabsorption rates. = 新技术将允许对相互吸收速率进行精确测量。

虚拟语气:
If there were no interabsorption, the signal strength would be much higher. = 如果没有相互吸收，信号强度会高得多。

被动语态:
Interabsorption of the reactants was observed in the experiment. = 在实验中观察到了反应物的相互吸收。
The effects of interabsorption are widely studied in many fields. = 相互吸收的影响在许多领域都被广泛研究。


疑问句:
What causes the interabsorption of these two substances? = 什么导致了这两种物质的相互吸收？
Is the interabsorption a reversible process? = 相互吸收是一个可逆过程吗？


否定句:
There was no significant interabsorption detected in the control group. = 在对照组中未检测到明显的相互吸收。
The absence of interabsorption indicates a different chemical process. = 没有相互吸收表明存在不同的化学过程。


PHRASE->
degree of interabsorption = 相互吸收程度
rate of interabsorption = 相互吸收速率
effects of interabsorption = 相互吸收的影响
mechanism of interabsorption = 相互吸收机制
