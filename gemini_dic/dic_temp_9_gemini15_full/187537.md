The word "romancy" does not exist as a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).

If you intended a different word, please provide the correct spelling.  If you meant to create a new word,  consider providing context or intended meaning so I can offer suggestions on how to create a definition, including pronunciation, usage, etc., based on your vision.
