USAGE->
This word is a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "what".  Therefore, verb tenses (present, past, future, etc.) and voice (active/passive) are not applicable.  The word itself is a statement of the nature of the speech.

例句1：Her explanation was pure habnab. 她的解释纯属胡说八道。
例句2：Don't fill my head with habnab. 不要跟我说废话。


PHRASE->
There are no common set phrases directly using "habnab" as it's a relatively informal and rarely used word.  Phrases would be built around it, describing the habnab, rather than "habnab" being a core component of a set phrase.  For example:

a load of habnab 一堆废话
nothing but habnab  全是胡说八道
utter habnab  纯粹的胡说八道
speak habnab 说胡话
full of habnab  充满废话
