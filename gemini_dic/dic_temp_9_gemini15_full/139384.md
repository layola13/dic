词源:
The word derives from "observable" (adjective), adding the suffix "-ness" (to form a noun denoting a quality or state) and then the plural "-es."  "Observable" comes from the verb "observe" + "-able" (capable of being).  "Observe" ultimately derives from the Latin "observare" (to keep watching, observe).
