nondimensional:/ˌnɒn.daɪˈmɛnʃənəl/ | adj. | 无量纲的，无因次的 |  Lacking physical dimensions; expressed as a pure number.  Nondimensional quantities are often used to simplify equations and make them easier to understand and solve in various fields like physics and engineering.  They are obtained by dividing a quantity by a combination of other quantities with dimensions so that the resulting quantity has no dimensions.  For example, the Reynolds number is a nondimensional quantity used in fluid mechanics. | The Reynolds number is a nondimensional quantity used to predict whether fluid flow will be laminar or turbulent.  雷诺数是一个无量纲量，用于预测流体流动是层流还是湍流。

The Mach number is a nondimensional quantity representing the ratio of the speed of an object to the speed of sound. 马赫数是一个无量纲量，表示物体速度与声速之比。| dimensionless, unitless | dimensional |
