词源:The word "conjubilant" is a relatively rare word, formed by combining the prefix "con-" (meaning "together" or "with") and "jubilant," which comes from the Latin "jubilare" (to shout for joy).  The combination suggests a shared or collective feeling of great joy.  While not as common as "jubilant," it emphasizes a sense of shared triumph and celebration.
