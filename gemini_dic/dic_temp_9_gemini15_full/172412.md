**Regarding the Etymology:**

The name "PricewaterhouseCoopers" is derived from the mergers of several accounting firms:

* **Price Waterhouse:**  This firm had a long history, tracing back to 1849 in London.  The etymology of the names "Price" and "Waterhouse" would involve researching the founders' family history, which is beyond the scope of this response.

* **Coopers & Lybrand:**  Similarly, this firm's history is complex, involving mergers and changes over time.  The name reflects the founders' names.


The merger that created PricewaterhouseCoopers occurred in 1998.  Therefore, the etymology is a combination of the histories and names of the predecessor firms.
