The word "nonintuitivenesses" is not a commonly used word.  It's a relatively rare formation created by adding the plural suffix "-es" to "nonintuitiveness," which itself is formed by adding the prefix "non-" to "intuitiveness."


**Word Formation:**

* **Intuitive:**  This is the base word, meaning easily understood or learned; instinctive.  Its origin is from the Latin word *intueri*, meaning "to look at, contemplate, consider."

* **Intuitiveness:** This is a noun derived from "intuitive," referring to the quality of being intuitive.

* **Nonintuitiveness:** This adds the prefix "non-," meaning "not," creating the antonym of "intuitiveness," signifying the lack of intuitive quality; something that is not easily understood or learned.

* **Nonintuitivenesses:** This is the plural form of "nonintuitiveness," referring to multiple instances or aspects of a lack of intuitiveness.


**Usage Note:**

While grammatically correct, using "nonintuitivenesses" is generally considered cumbersome and overly formal.  Simpler alternatives, like "lack of intuitiveness," "unintuitive features," or "counterintuitive aspects," are preferred in most contexts.



**Example Sentences (Illustrating the concept, not necessarily using "nonintuitivenesses"):**

There is no need to provide grammatical examples (tense, voice, etc.) as the word itself is a noun and doesn't conjugate like verbs. The examples above sufficiently illustrate the concept.  The word's rarity makes extensive grammatical examples impractical.
