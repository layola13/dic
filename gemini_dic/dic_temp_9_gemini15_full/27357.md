词源:
The word "cambrel" likely derives from a combination of Old French and medieval Latin roots, possibly related to words meaning "curved" or "bent," reflecting the shape of the object it describes.  The precise etymology is debated among linguists, but its historical usage strongly links it to the curved components of saddles and shoes.
