dimensionless:/daɪˈmɛnʃən.ləs/| adj. |无量纲的，无维度的|Lacking dimensions; having no units.  A dimensionless quantity is a pure number, without any physical units.  For example, the ratio of two lengths is dimensionless because the units cancel out.  Dimensionless quantities are often used in physics and engineering to simplify calculations and make results more general. |Example: The Reynolds number is a dimensionless quantity used in fluid mechanics to predict whether flow will be laminar or turbulent.|近义词:unitless, scalar|反义词:dimensional
