metacentre:/ˈmɛtəsɛntər/ | n. |形心, 稳心 |The point of intersection of the vertical line through the centre of buoyancy of a floating body and a line through the centre of buoyancy parallel to the waterline, when the body is slightly inclined.  It is a crucial point in determining the stability of a floating body.  | The metacentre is located above the centre of buoyancy. If the metacentre is above the centre of gravity, the body is stable; if it is below, the body is unstable. |近义词: centre of buoyancy, centre of gravity (in relation to stability) |反义词: N/A


USAGE->

词源:

The word "metacentre" is derived from the Greek words "meta-" (meaning "beyond" or "after") and "centre".  It refers to a point that is beyond or related to the centre of buoyancy.
