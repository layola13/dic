词源:

The word "restorable" comes from the verb "restore," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "restorer," meaning "to restore, rebuild, or bring back."  "Restorer" itself comes from the Latin word "re-," meaning "again," and "stare," meaning "to stand."  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or possibility.
