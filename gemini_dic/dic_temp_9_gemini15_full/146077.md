词源:

The word "overedited" is a compound word formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the past participle "edited" (from the verb "to edit").  The verb "to edit" itself comes from the Middle English word "editen," ultimately deriving from the Old French "editer," meaning "to publish" or "to prepare for publication."  The shift in meaning from publication to the act of revision and correction occurred over time.
