词源:

The word's origin is uncertain, but it's likely a blend or alteration of  "high-falutin'," which itself is of uncertain origin.  The "high" suggests elevated status or style, while "falutin'" may be a playful alteration of a word related to "falsetto" (a high-pitched voice), hinting at artificiality.  The shift from "high-falutin'" to "hifalutin" is a natural phonetic evolution.
