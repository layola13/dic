词源:
The word "mouldability" is derived from the verb "to mould" (or "to mold" in American English), meaning to shape or form something, plus the suffix "-ability," indicating capacity or potential.  The root of "mould" can be traced back to Old English "mōld," meaning "earth," "soil," or "dust," reflecting the original use of earth and clay as moldable materials.
