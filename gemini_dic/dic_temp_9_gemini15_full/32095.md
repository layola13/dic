词源:

The word "cheesy" is derived from "cheese," referring to the strong, sometimes overwhelming, smell and taste of cheese.  The figurative use evolved from the association of an overpowering or artificial quality with the strong flavor of cheese, extending to describe things that are overly sentimental, insincere, or of poor quality.
