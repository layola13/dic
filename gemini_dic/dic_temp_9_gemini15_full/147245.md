词源:

The word "overmelodious" is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great extent) and "melodious" (meaning having a pleasant melody).  "Melodious" ultimately derives from the Greek word "melos" (μέλος), meaning "song" or "melody," combined with the "-ous" suffix to form an adjective.
