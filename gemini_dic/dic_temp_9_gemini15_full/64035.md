词源:
The word "epitheloid" is a combination of "epithelial" and "-oid," a suffix meaning "resembling" or "like."  "Epithelial" refers to epithelium, the lining of body cavities and surfaces.  Therefore, epithelioid describes something that resembles epithelium in appearance or function.


用法说明:
The adjective "epithelioid" is primarily used in a medical context, particularly in histology and pathology. It's used to describe cells (often immune cells like macrophages) that have taken on a morphology similar to epithelial cells, characterized by their size, shape, and arrangement in tissues.  It's important to note that epithelioid cells are not actually epithelial cells; they are other cell types that have adopted an epithelial-like appearance.  This change in appearance is often associated with inflammatory or infectious processes.
