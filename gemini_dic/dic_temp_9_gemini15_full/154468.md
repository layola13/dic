perovskite:/pəˈrɒvskʌɪt/ | /pəˈrɑːvskʌɪt/ | n. |钙钛矿|A perovskite is a mineral composed of calcium titanate (CaTiO₃), characterized by its specific crystal structure.  This structure has been adopted as a model for a large class of materials with similar structures, often involving different elements substituting for calcium, titanium, and oxygen.  These materials are also called perovskites and are known for their diverse applications, especially in solar energy. | Example:  Many researchers are studying perovskite solar cells due to their potential for high efficiency and low cost.  许多研究人员正在研究钙钛矿太阳能电池，因为它们具有高效率和低成本的潜力。|近义词：calcium titanate (only in the mineral sense)|反义词：无|名词
