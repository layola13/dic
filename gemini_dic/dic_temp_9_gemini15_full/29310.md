词源:
The word "castellation" comes from the Late Latin word *castellatio*, meaning "fortification," which in turn derives from *castellum*, meaning "small castle" or "fort."  The suffix "-ation" indicates the process or result of something.  Therefore, "castellation" literally means "the act of making something like a small castle" or "the resulting structure resembling a small castle."
