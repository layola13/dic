词源:
The word "gutsiness" is derived from the word "guts," which originally referred to the internal organs.  Over time, "guts" came to be associated with courage and determination, likely because facing danger requires inner strength.  The suffix "-iness" is added to create the noun form, indicating a quality or state of having guts.
