词源:
The word "butcher" ultimately comes from the Old French "bocchier," which referred to a person who slaughtered animals.  The sense of "to mutilate or spoil" (as in "butcher a performance") developed later.  The slang use referring to a lesbian is a relatively recent development and carries a complex history of marginalization and reclaimed language.
