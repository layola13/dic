The word "petuskin" is not a recognized word in English or any major dictionary.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It is possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a neologism:** It might be a newly coined word, specific to a certain community or context.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, it might be possible to understand its meaning.
* **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a name or place name not widely known.
* **It's a made-up word:**  It may be a fictional word invented for a specific purpose (like in a book or game).
