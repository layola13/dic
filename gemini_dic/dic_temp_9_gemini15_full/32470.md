词源:

The word "chinas" originates from the word "China," referring to the country.  The association with porcelain comes from the fact that high-quality porcelain was originally produced in China and became widely known and exported globally.  Over time, "china" became synonymous with porcelain itself.  The plural form "chinas" is used to refer to multiple pieces of porcelain.
