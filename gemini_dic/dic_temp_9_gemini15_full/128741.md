词源:
The word "niggardliness" is derived from the Old English word "nigard," meaning "miser" or "stingy."  This, in turn, has uncertain origins, possibly related to Old Norse or Old Dutch words with similar meanings. The "-liness" suffix is a common English suffix that transforms adjectives into nouns, signifying a quality or state.  It's important to note that the word "niggard" itself has fallen out of common use due to its phonetic similarity to a deeply offensive racial slur. While the etymology is unrelated, the association renders "niggard" and its derivatives largely unusable in modern English.  "Niggardliness" therefore exists primarily in dictionaries and older texts.
