The word "matajuelo" is not found in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a word from a specific dialect or language, possibly Spanish.  To provide an analysis, I need more context.  Is it Spanish?  If so, please provide that information so I can provide the requested analysis.  I can't generate a complete entry without knowing the language and its meaning.
