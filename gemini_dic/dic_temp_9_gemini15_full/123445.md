monopoloid:/ˈmɒnəpɔɪd/| adj.| 单倍体的；单倍性的 | Having a single set of chromosomes.  A monopoloid cell or organism possesses only one set of chromosomes, unlike diploid organisms which have two sets. This is often found in gametes (sex cells) before fertilization. | Example:  The gametes are monopoloid, containing only half the number of chromosomes found in somatic cells.  单倍体配子只包含体细胞中染色体数量的一半。|近义词：haploid |反义词：diploid, polyploid


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The plant is monopoloid. = 这植物是单倍体的。
This cell remains monopoloid. = 这个细胞保持单倍体状态。


一般过去时:
The scientists created a monopoloid strain. = 科学家们创造了一个单倍体菌株。
The sample was initially monopoloid. = 样本最初是单倍体的。


现在完成时:
Researchers have successfully produced a monopoloid organism. = 研究人员已经成功地培育出一种单倍体生物。
They have observed that the cells are monopoloid. = 他们已经观察到这些细胞是单倍体的。


过去完成时:
The experiment had shown that the cells were monopoloid. = 实验已经表明这些细胞是单倍体的。
Scientists had determined that the organism was monopoloid. = 科学家们已经确定该生物是单倍体的。


将来时:
We will induce monopoloidy in the cells. = 我们将诱导细胞成为单倍体。
The treatment will result in a monopoloid state. = 此治疗将导致单倍体状态。


虚拟语气:
If it were monopoloid, it would reproduce differently. = 如果它是单倍体，它的繁殖方式就会不同。
I wish I had known that the sample was monopoloid earlier. = 我真希望我早点知道这个样本是单倍体的。


被动语态:
The cells were engineered to be monopoloid. = 这些细胞被设计成单倍体。
Monopoloidy was induced using a specific technique. = 使用一种特定的技术诱导单倍性。


疑问句:
Is the organism monopoloid? = 这个生物是单倍体吗？
Are these cells monopoloid or diploid? = 这些细胞是单倍体还是二倍体？


否定句:
The plant is not monopoloid; it is diploid. = 这植物不是单倍体；它是二倍体。
The results did not indicate that the cells were monopoloid. = 结果并没有表明这些细胞是单倍体的。


PHRASE->
monopoloid organism = 单倍体生物
monopoloid culture = 单倍体培养物
induced monopoloidy = 诱导单倍性
monopoloid gamete = 单倍体配子
