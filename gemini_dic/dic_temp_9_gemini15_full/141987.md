/ˌɔːrɡænɪˈkælənəsɪz/ | n. | 有机性；有机体的性质 | The word "organicalnesses" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be an artificially created word, likely formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" (indicating a plural of qualities or states) to "organical," itself an adjective meaning relating to or characteristic of living organisms.  Therefore, a direct translation and detailed grammatical analysis is not possible.  The intended meaning might be something like "various aspects or qualities of organic matter or living things."  However, the word is unusual and would not be used in typical English writing or speech.  There are no standard synonyms or antonyms as the word itself is not standard.
