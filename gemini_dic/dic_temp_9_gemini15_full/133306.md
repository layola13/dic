例句：

词源:

The word is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "explanative" (derived from "explain").  "Explain" ultimately comes from the Late Latin *explanare,  a combination of *ex- ("out") and *planare ("to make level, smooth, or plain").  Therefore, "nonexplanative" literally means "not making something level, smooth, or plain" in terms of understanding.


用法说明：

This word is primarily used in academic or formal contexts to describe something that fails to provide sufficient explanation or clarification.  It highlights the lack of interpretative detail or context, implying a deficiency in understanding.  It is less common in everyday conversation.
