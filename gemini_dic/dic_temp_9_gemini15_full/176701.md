词源:

The word "reactionariness" is derived from the adjective "reactionary," which itself originates from the noun "reaction."  "Reaction" in this context stems from the French word "réaction," ultimately tracing back to the Latin "re-" (back, again) and "agere" (to do, to act).  Thus, "reactionariness" literally describes the state or quality of being characterized by a backward-looking, resistant response to change.


用法说明:

Reactionariness is typically used to describe ideologies, policies, or movements characterized by resistance to change and a desire to revert to previous states.  It carries a negative connotation, suggesting a stubborn clinging to outdated ideas and a rejection of progress.  The term is often applied in political discourse to criticize those who oppose social or political reform.  It’s important to note that while conservatism shares some similarities, reactionariness is generally considered more extreme and resistant to even moderate change.
