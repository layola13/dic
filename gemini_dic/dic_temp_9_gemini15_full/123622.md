/ˈmʌnθliːst/ | adj. | 每月一次的；最每月；最常见的 |  The word "monthliest" is not a standard word in English. It seems to be a blend of "monthly" and "most," attempting to convey the meaning of "most monthly" or "occurring most frequently each month."  However, this is grammatically incorrect and unnatural. To express this meaning, use "most frequent monthly," "occurring most often each month," or a similar phrase. |  The rain was monthliest during July. (Incorrect usage; should be: The rain was most frequent in July.) |近义词：most frequent, most common |反义词：least frequent, rarest |形容词
