Etymology:

The word "inveteracy" comes from the Latin word "inveteratus," the past participle of "inveterare," meaning "to make old, to grow old."  The prefix "in-" intensifies the meaning, while "-acy" is a suffix forming nouns of state or quality.  Therefore, the word literally refers to a state of being deeply ingrained or long-established.
