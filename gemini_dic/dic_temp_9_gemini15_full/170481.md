词源:

The word "prurient" comes from the Latin word "prurire," meaning "to itch."  It originally referred to a physical itching sensation, but over time, its meaning shifted to describe an intense, almost insatiable craving or desire, particularly in the context of sexual matters.  The association likely stems from the idea of an irresistible urge or longing, similar to the feeling of an itch one must scratch.
