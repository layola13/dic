The word "nonfrustrations" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  To offer a helpful response, we need to understand the intended meaning.  Is it meant to be the opposite of "frustrations"? If so, a more appropriate word would be "satisfactions" or "achievements".

If you can provide context where you encountered this word, I can offer a more accurate interpretation and potentially suggest suitable alternatives.
