The word "choops" is not a standard English word found in dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is not possible.  It's likely a:

* **Non-standard spelling:** Perhaps a misspelling of another word, a regional dialect word, or an invented word.  More context is needed to determine its intended meaning.
* **Interjection:** It might function as an interjection expressing surprise, mild annoyance, or a similar emotion, similar to "oops."


To provide an analysis, I need more information about where you encountered this word and the context in which it was used.  With additional context, I might be able to offer a more informed interpretation.
