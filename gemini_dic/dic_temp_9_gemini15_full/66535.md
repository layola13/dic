WORD ORIGIN->
The word "exhaustiveness" is derived from the adjective "exhaustive," which comes from the verb "exhaust," ultimately from Old French *exhauster (to empty, drain), from Latin *exhaurire (to draw out, drain).  The suffix "-ness" is added to form the noun, indicating the quality or state of being exhaustive.
