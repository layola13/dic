The word "geld's" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a word from a specific dialect or context not widely recognized.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, more context is needed.  Is this from a book, a conversation, or another source? Knowing the source would help determine the intended word and allow for a proper analysis.
