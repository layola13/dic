/ˌoʊvərəˈpriːʃieɪtɪvnəsɪz/ | n. |过度感激；过分欣赏 |The word "overappreciativenesses" is extremely rare and arguably not a legitimate word in standard English.  It's a hyper-formed noun, indicating multiple instances of excessive appreciation. It is formed by adding "-ness" (to create the noun "overappreciativeness") and then "-es" (to create the plural "overappreciativenesses").  There's no established usage or dictionary entry for this word.  Its creation is based on the combining of "over" (too much), "appreciate" (to value highly), and multiple pluralizing suffixes.  Because of its unusual and unwieldy nature, it's best to avoid using this word.  Instead, use clearer and more concise alternatives. | Example sentences are difficult to construct naturally due to the word's awkwardness.  One might contrive something like: "His overappreciativenesses bordered on the obsessive; he thanked everyone repeatedly for even the smallest gesture." but this sounds unnatural. |近义词: excessive expressions of gratitude, multiple instances of over-appreciation |反义词: underappreciation, ingratitude | n.
