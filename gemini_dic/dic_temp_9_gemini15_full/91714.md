/ˌhaɪpərˌkɒnstɪˈtjuːʃənəlɪzəm/| n. | 超级宪政主义 |  Hyperconstitutionalism refers to a theoretical and practical approach to constitutional law and governance that goes beyond traditional understandings of constitutionalism. It emphasizes the dynamic and evolving nature of constitutions, often advocating for greater judicial activism, stronger protection of fundamental rights, and a more robust role for constitutional courts in shaping societal norms and values. It can involve innovative interpretations of existing constitutional texts and the development of new constitutional principles to address contemporary challenges.  Unlike traditional constitutionalism, which focuses primarily on the text and original intent of a constitution, hyperconstitutionalism embraces a more fluid and context-sensitive approach.  | The rise of hyperconstitutionalism is evident in the increasing willingness of courts to engage in judicial review and to strike down legislation deemed incompatible with evolving standards of human rights and social justice. |  (近义词难以找到精确的对应词，因为这是个相对较新的学术概念，可以考虑用“advanced constitutionalism” 或 “expansive constitutionalism”作部分近似) | (反义词难以找到精确的对应词，可以考虑用 “traditional constitutionalism” 或 “strict constitutionalism”) | 名词
