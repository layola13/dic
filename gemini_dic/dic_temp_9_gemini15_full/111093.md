词源:  The word "litany" comes from the Late Latin word *litania*, which in turn derives from the Greek word *litaneia* (λιτάνεια), meaning "supplication," "entreaty," or "prayer."  The Greek word is related to the verb *litaneuein* (λιτανεύειν), meaning "to beseech" or "to implore."  The original meaning thus referred to a religious procession or prayer service involving repeated supplications.
