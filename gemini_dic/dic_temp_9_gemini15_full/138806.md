numpy:/ˈnʌmpi/| n. |NumPy(数值Python)|NumPy is a fundamental Python library for scientific computing.  It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a vast collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.|Example:  `import numpy as np; array = np.array([1, 2, 3]); print(array)`  导入NumPy库并创建一个数组。|近义词：SciPy (部分功能重叠)|反义词：无|名词


USAGE->
This word is a proper noun and doesn't conjugate like a verb.  It's used as a library name, not a verb or adjective. Therefore, grammatical tenses and moods are not applicable.  The following examples show its usage in code:


Example 1: Creating an array
```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(arr) # Output: [1 2 3 4 5]
```
This code imports the NumPy library and creates a one-dimensional array.


Example 2: Performing mathematical operations
```python
import numpy as np
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
arr2 = np.array([4, 5, 6])
sum_arr = arr1 + arr2
print(sum_arr) # Output: [5 7 9]
```
This code adds two NumPy arrays element-wise.


Example 3:  Reshaping arrays
```python
import numpy as np
arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
reshaped_arr = arr.reshape(3, 2)
print(reshaped_arr)
```
This code reshapes a 2x3 array into a 3x2 array.


PHRASE->
NumPy arrays are often used with:

1. `np.array()`:  To create arrays.
2. `np.shape()`: To get the dimensions of an array.
3. `np.mean()`: To calculate the mean of an array.
4. `np.sum()`: To calculate the sum of elements in an array.
5. `np.dot()`: For matrix multiplication.
