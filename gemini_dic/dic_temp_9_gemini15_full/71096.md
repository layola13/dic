The term "fish-slice" does not exist as a standard English word with a recognized definition in dictionaries or common usage.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  It might be:

1. **A newly coined word:** Perhaps it's a neologism, a newly invented word or phrase, specific to a niche community, a fictional work, or a brand name.  More context is needed to understand its meaning.

2. **A misspelling:** It could be a misspelling of a similar-sounding word or phrase.

3. **A compound word:** It appears to be a compound of "fish" and "slice," suggesting a possible meaning related to a slice of fish, but without more information, this is purely speculative.


To provide the requested analysis, I would need additional context, such as:

* **The source where you encountered this term:** A book, article, website, conversation, etc.
* **The surrounding text:** The sentences or paragraphs in which the term appears would help clarify its meaning.


Without this information, I cannot provide the requested format with pronunciation, word class, definition, examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage.
