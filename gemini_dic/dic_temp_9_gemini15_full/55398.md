distensibility:/ˌdɪˌstenʃəˈbɪləti/| n.| 延展性，可扩张性 | The ability of a material to expand or stretch when subjected to pressure or tension.  It often refers to the ability of a hollow organ (like the bladder or blood vessel) to expand in response to increased volume. | Example: The distensibility of the arteries is crucial for maintaining blood flow. 动脉的延展性对于维持血流至关重要。The balloon's high distensibility allowed it to expand to a large size. 气球的高延展性使其能够膨胀到很大的尺寸。|近义词：expandability, elasticity, compliance | 反义词：rigidity, inelasticity
