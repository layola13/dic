sheriffdoms: /ˈʃɛrɪfdəm/ | n. |郡县；司法管辖区 | The territories under the jurisdiction of a sheriff.  Sheriffdoms represent the areas of authority for sheriffs, often encompassing counties or similar administrative divisions.  These areas can vary significantly in size and population depending on the region and legal framework. |Example: The old sheriffdoms of the region were reorganized into larger administrative units.  这个地区的旧郡县被重组成了更大的行政单位。


The history of the term sheriffdom is intertwined with the evolution of the office of sheriff itself.  The word "sheriff" originates from the Old English "scīrgerefa," meaning "shire reeve."  "Shire" referred to a territorial division, and "reeve" denoted a government official or steward.  Thus, a sheriff was originally a royal officer responsible for maintaining order and enforcing the law within a specific shire.  Over time, the term "sheriffdom" emerged to denote the area under a sheriff's jurisdiction.  The term's usage is primarily historical or found in contexts referring to specific historical or fictional regions.
