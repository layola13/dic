nonmutant: /ˈnɑːnˈmjuːtənt/ | adj. | 非突变体的；未突变的 | Not exhibiting a mutation; of or relating to an organism or cell that has not undergone mutation.  | Example: The nonmutant strain showed normal growth patterns.  非突变菌株显示正常的生长模式。 | 近义词：wild-type, normal, unaltered | 反义词：mutant, mutated


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The nonmutant bacteria reproduce rapidly. = 非突变细菌繁殖迅速。
This nonmutant strain is resistant to the antibiotic. = 这种非突变菌株对该抗生素具有抗性。

一般过去时:
The researchers studied the nonmutant cells. = 研究人员研究了非突变细胞。
The nonmutant allele was expressed normally. = 非突变等位基因正常表达。

现在完成时:
Scientists have observed the behavior of the nonmutant organism. = 科学家们已经观察了非突变生物的行为。
They have confirmed that the nonmutant gene functions correctly. = 他们已经证实非突变基因功能正常。

过去完成时:
Before the experiment, the scientists had prepared the nonmutant samples. = 实验前，科学家们已经准备好了非突变样本。
The researchers had already analyzed the nonmutant DNA. = 研究人员已经分析了非突变DNA。

将来时:
We will compare the nonmutant phenotype with the mutant phenotype. = 我们将比较非突变性状和突变性状。
They will sequence the genome of the nonmutant organism. = 他们将对非突变生物体的基因组进行测序。

虚拟语气:
If this were a nonmutant cell, it would divide normally. = 如果这是一个非突变细胞，它会正常分裂。
It is essential that the nonmutant control group be maintained. = 必须保持非突变对照组。

被动语态:
The nonmutant gene was identified by the researchers. = 非突变基因被研究人员鉴定出来。
The nonmutant samples were carefully prepared for the analysis. = 非突变样本被仔细地准备用于分析。

疑问句:
Is this a nonmutant strain or a mutant strain? = 这是非突变菌株还是突变菌株？
Are the observed effects due to the nonmutant genotype? = 观察到的效果是由于非突变基因型吗？

否定句:
This is not a nonmutant organism; it has several mutations. = 这不是非突变生物；它有几个突变。
The results were not consistent with the expectations for a nonmutant phenotype. = 结果与非突变表型的预期不一致。
