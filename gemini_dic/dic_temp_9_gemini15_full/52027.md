词源:  The word "dialectal" is derived from the noun "dialect," which ultimately comes from the Late Latin word *dialectus*, meaning "conversation, discourse, language."  This, in turn, stems from the Greek word *dialektos* (διάλεκτος), which combines *dia-* (διά), meaning "through," "across," or "between," and *legein* (λέγειν), meaning "to speak."  Thus, the original meaning hinted at a conversation or way of speaking that was specific to a certain group or region. The suffix "-al" is added to form the adjective "dialectal."
