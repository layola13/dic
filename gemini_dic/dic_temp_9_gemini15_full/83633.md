haemodynamics:/ˌhiːməʊˈdaɪnæmɪks/| n. |血液动力学|The study of blood flow and pressure within the circulatory system.  It involves the forces that influence the circulation of blood. This includes the pumping action of the heart, the physical properties of blood, and the characteristics of the blood vessels.| Example:  The doctor ordered a haemodynamic assessment to evaluate the patient's heart function.  医生下令进行血液动力学评估以评估病人的心脏功能。|近义词：circulation dynamics, cardiovascular dynamics |反义词：N/A
