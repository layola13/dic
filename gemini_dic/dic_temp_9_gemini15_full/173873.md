quasi-recently:/ˈkwɑːzaɪ ˈriːsntli/ | adj. |准最近地，近来地 |  This word is not a standard English word. It's a combination of "quasi-" (meaning seemingly, apparently, or to a certain extent) and "recently." It implies something that is somewhat recent but not entirely so;  it suggests a period of time that is relatively close to the present but not definitively recent.  It is used to express a degree of uncertainty or vagueness about the exact timeframe.  The word is rarely used in formal writing. |  The project was quasi-recently completed, meaning it finished within the last few months, but the exact date is unclear.  | 近义词:relatively recently, approximately recently | 反义词: long ago, a long time ago | adj.
