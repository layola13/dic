词源:
The word "forlornness" is derived from the adjective "forlorn," which ultimately traces back to Old English "forloren," meaning "lost," "abandoned," or "deserted."  "Forloren" itself is composed of "for-" (a prefix indicating loss or deprivation) and "loren" (past participle of "losan," meaning "to lose").  Thus, the root meaning of "forlornness" is the state of being lost, abandoned, or hopeless.
