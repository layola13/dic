homotaxy:/hoʊˈmætəksi/ | n. | 同序; 同位; 同层位 |  The occurrence of similar or identical sequences of events in different lineages or regions, especially in the geological context of similar rock formations.  This refers to a similarity in the order of events, not necessarily a causal relationship.  For example, two different geographical areas might have experienced similar sequences of rock formation, even if the underlying processes were distinct. | Example: The homotaxy of the fossil assemblages in the two regions suggests a similar evolutionary history, although the actual species involved might differ.  两个地区的化石组合的同序性表明它们具有相似的进化史，尽管所涉及的物种可能不同。| 近义词：correspondence, similarity, parallelism | 反义词：heterotaxy
