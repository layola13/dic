词源:

Etiolation comes from the Late Latin word *etiolatus*, the past participle of *etiolare*, meaning "to become pale."  This, in turn, likely derives from Latin *etiolus*, a diminutive of *etus*, meaning "tender shoot" or "sprout."  The sense of paleness developed from the observation that plants grown in darkness appear pale and weak.
