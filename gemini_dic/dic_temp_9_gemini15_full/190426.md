The word "SARS" does not follow the requested format because it is an acronym, not a single word with etymology and grammatical variations in the way "what" would be.  I cannot provide a full grammatical breakdown as requested.  However, I can provide information about SARS.

SARS: /sɑːrz/ | n. |严重急性呼吸综合征 | Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome | SARS is an acronym for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, a viral pneumonia caused by a coronavirus.  The outbreak in 2002-2003 caused significant global concern. | Example: The SARS outbreak of 2003 led to significant changes in public health protocols.  严重急性呼吸综合征2003年的爆发导致公共卫生协议发生了重大变化。|近义词:  Coronavirus (in this context)|反义词: N/A


There is no verb, adjective, or other grammatical form for "SARS"  as it functions solely as a noun.  Therefore, sections like USAGE (with tense variations), PHRASE, etc., are not applicable.
