nonconductibility:/ˌnɒnkɒndʌktɪˈbɪləti/ | n. | 非导电性，不导电性 | The inability of a substance to conduct electricity or heat.  This property is crucial in electrical insulation. | Example: The high nonconductibility of rubber makes it ideal for electrical wire coatings.  橡胶的高非导电性使其成为电线涂层的理想材料。 | 近义词：insulation, resistance | 反义词：conductivity, conductance


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "to be", "to have" etc.  It describes a property and therefore doesn't change in tense.  Grammatical usage examples will focus on sentence structures where "nonconductibility" plays a role.


Simple Sentence:
The nonconductibility of this material is surprisingly high. = 这种材料的非导电性出奇地高。
The experiment demonstrated the nonconductibility of the sample. = 实验证明了样品的非导电性。


Complex Sentence:
Because of its high nonconductibility, the material is suitable for use in high-voltage applications. = 由于其高非导电性，该材料适用于高压应用。
We chose this insulator due to its superior nonconductibility compared to other options. = 我们选择这种绝缘体是因为它比其他选择具有更好的非导电性。


Compound Sentence:
The material showed excellent nonconductibility; therefore, it passed the safety test. = 该材料表现出优异的非导电性；因此，它通过了安全测试。
The nonconductibility was measured accurately, and the results confirmed our hypothesis. = 非导电性被精确测量，结果证实了我们的假设。


PHRASE->
high nonconductibility = 高非导电性
low nonconductibility = 低非导电性
degree of nonconductibility = 非导电程度
test for nonconductibility = 非导电性测试
measurement of nonconductibility = 非导电性测量
