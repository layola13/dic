词源:

The word "exaggeratory" is derived from the verb "exaggerate," which itself comes from the Late Latin word "exagero," a compound of "ex-" (out, beyond) and "aggero" (to heap up, pile up).  Thus, the root meaning points to "heaping up beyond," indicating an overstatement or amplification.


用法说明:

Exaggeratory is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that is exaggerated or characterized by exaggeration.  It is less frequently used than the verb "exaggerate" but serves a useful purpose when directly describing the nature of something as being overstated.  It is often found in formal writing and speech.
