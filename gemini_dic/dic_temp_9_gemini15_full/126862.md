词源:

The etymology of "nappa" is uncertain, but it's widely believed to originate from the city of Napa in Italy, a region historically known for its leather production. However, definitive historical evidence linking the leather type directly to Napa, Italy is lacking.  The term's usage evolved to describe the specific type of soft leather rather than a geographical origin.
