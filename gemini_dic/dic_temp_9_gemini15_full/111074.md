The word "listeric" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  If you can provide the intended word or more context, I can offer a more helpful response.
