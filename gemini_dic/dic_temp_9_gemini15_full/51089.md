The word "despeed" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized field.

To help you, I can offer some possibilities:

* **If it's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of words like "despise" or  "dispeed" (though "dispeed" also isn't a standard word).  If you can provide the context where you encountered "despeed," I might be able to suggest a likely intended word.

* **If it's a neologism or specialized term:**  If it's a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field (like technology or engineering), more context is needed to understand its meaning and usage.  Could you provide the sentence or paragraph where you saw this word?


Without further information, I cannot provide an analysis using your requested format. Please provide context for the word "despeed".
