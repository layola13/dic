cosmic-string: /ˈkɒzmɪk strɪŋ/ | n. |宇宙弦|

英文解析：In cosmology, a cosmic string is a hypothetical one-dimensional topological defect, a type of theoretical object predicted by some models of the early universe.  They are thought to be extremely thin, incredibly dense, and to have immense gravitational effects.  Their existence is still unproven.

例句：

The theory suggests that cosmic strings could have played a significant role in the formation of galaxies. = 理论认为宇宙弦可能在星系的形成中发挥了重要作用。

Some physicists believe that the detection of gravitational waves could provide evidence for the existence of cosmic strings. = 一些物理学家认为引力波的探测可以为宇宙弦的存在提供证据。
