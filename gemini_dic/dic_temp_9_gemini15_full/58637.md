词源:
The word "dumbest" is the superlative form of "dumb," which ultimately derives from the Old English word "dumb," meaning "mute," "silent," or "speechless."  Over time, the meaning shifted to include the sense of "stupid" or "unintelligent."  The addition of "-est" creates the superlative, indicating the highest degree of dumbness.
