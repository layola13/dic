词源:  The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or too much) and "focuses" (the third-person singular present tense of the verb "focus," meaning to concentrate or direct attention).  The root of "focus" comes from the Latin word "focus," meaning "hearth" or "fireplace," referencing the point where rays of light converge.  The metaphorical extension to concentration is relatively recent.
