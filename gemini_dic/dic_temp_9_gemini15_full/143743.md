词源:
The word "outmaneuver" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "to surpass" or "to exceed") and the word "maneuver," which comes from the Old French word "manoeuvre," ultimately derived from the Latin "manus" (hand) and "opera" (works).  Therefore, the original meaning related to skillful handling, and "outmaneuver" extends this to skillful strategic surpassing.
