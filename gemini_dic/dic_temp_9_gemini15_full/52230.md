词源:  The word "diatribe" comes from the Greek word "diatribe" (διατριβή), which means "a prolonged discourse," "a way of life," or "a manner of living."  In classical Greek rhetoric, it originally referred to a philosophical discussion, but over time, its meaning shifted to its current connotation of a bitter and prolonged attack.
