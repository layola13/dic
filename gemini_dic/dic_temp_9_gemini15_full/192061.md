词源:
The word "Scotsman" is a compound word.  "Scot" derives from the Old English word "Scotta," referring to the Gaelic-speaking people of Scotland.  The suffix "-man" is a common Old English suffix indicating a male person of a particular nationality or group.  Therefore, "Scotsman" literally means "a man from the land of the Scotta."
