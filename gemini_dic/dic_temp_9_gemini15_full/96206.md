词源:

The term "index-linked" is a compound word.  "Index" derives from the Latin word "index," meaning "pointer" or "indicator."  "Linked" comes from the Old English word "linc," meaning "a chain" or "connection." Therefore, "index-linked" literally means "connected to or based on an index."


用法说明:

"Index-linked" is primarily used as an adjective to describe financial instruments or schemes whose value or returns are directly related to the movement of a specific index.  The index could be a measure of inflation (e.g., Consumer Price Index), a stock market index (e.g., S&P 500), or another relevant economic indicator.  The purpose of index-linking is often to protect against the erosion of value due to inflation or other market fluctuations.
