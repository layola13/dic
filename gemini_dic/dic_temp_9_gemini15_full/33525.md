词源:  The word "cicisbeo" is derived from the Italian word "cicisbeo," which itself is of uncertain origin. Some etymologists suggest it might be derived from a dialectal form of "cicisbeo," which may be related to the word "cicisbeo" meaning "fop" or "dandy".  Ultimately, its precise origin remains debated.
