词源:

The word "invulnerability" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the root word "vulnerable" (meaning "capable of being wounded or hurt"), and the suffix "-ity" (meaning "state or condition").  Therefore, "invulnerability" literally means "the state of not being vulnerable."  "Vulnerable" itself has Latin roots, stemming from  "vulnus," meaning "wound."
