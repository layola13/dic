presufficient:/ˌpriːsəˈfɪʃənt/| adj. |预先充分的；先期充足的 |  A word not found in standard dictionaries.  It appears to be a newly coined word, combining "pre-" (meaning before) and "sufficient" (meaning enough). It would logically describe something that is sufficient *before* a particular point in time or event. There is no established meaning, usage, synonyms, or antonyms.  Since it's not a recognized word, providing grammatical examples is not possible.  The meaning would depend entirely on context.
