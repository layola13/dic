词源:The term "redneck" originated in the late 19th century in the Southern United States.  The "red neck" referred to the sunburned necks of poor white farmers who worked outdoors. Over time, it evolved into a derogatory term to describe people perceived as uneducated, unsophisticated, and often racist or prejudiced, typically from rural areas.  The association with sunburned necks is less relevant in modern usage, with the term now primarily carrying negative social connotations.
