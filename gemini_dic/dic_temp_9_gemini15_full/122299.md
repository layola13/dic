The word "mitsu" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a word from another language, possibly Japanese.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full etymological analysis, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., in the requested format.  To analyze a word, I need a word that exists in a language I am trained on.  If you provide a word from English or another language I'm familiar with, I'll be happy to help.
