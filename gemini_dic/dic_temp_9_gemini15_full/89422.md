homozygote:/ˈhoʊməˌzaɪɡoʊt/ | n. | 同型合子 | An individual having two identical alleles of a particular gene or genes.  A homozygote may be homozygous dominant (e.g., AA) or homozygous recessive (e.g., aa).  | Example:  The homozygous recessive individual showed the phenotypic expression of the recessive allele.  这个同型合子个体表现出隐性等位的表型表达。|近义词: homozygous individual | 反义词: heterozygote


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The plant is a homozygote for flower color. = 这株植物的花色是同型合子。
He is a homozygote for the gene responsible for eye color. = 他的眼睛颜色基因是同型合子。


一般过去时:
The researchers identified the individual as a homozygote for the disease gene. = 研究人员确定该个体是该疾病基因的同型合子。
Scientists found that the sample was a homozygote for the specific marker. = 科学家发现该样本是该特定标记的同型合子。


现在完成时:
Geneticists have confirmed that the patient is a homozygote. = 遗传学家已经确认该患者是同型合子。
We have discovered several homozygotes in our study population. = 我们在研究人群中发现了几个同型合子。


过去完成时:
They had already determined the individual was a homozygote before running further tests. = 在进行进一步测试之前，他们已经确定该个体是同型合子。
It had been established that the organism was a homozygote for the trait in question. = 已经确定该生物体是该性状的同型合子。


将来时:
The analysis will show whether the individual is a homozygote or heterozygote. = 分析将显示该个体是同型合子还是杂合子。
We will determine if the offspring are homozygotes for the recessive allele. = 我们将确定后代是否是隐性等位的同型合子。


虚拟语气:
If it were a homozygote, the phenotype would be different. = 如果它是同型合子，表型就会不同。
If the parents were both homozygotes, all offspring would be homozygotes. = 如果父母都是同型合子，所有后代都将是同型合子。


被动语态:
The individuals were classified as homozygotes based on their genotype. = 根据基因型，这些个体被归类为同型合子。
The samples were analyzed and determined to be homozygotes. = 样本经过分析，确定为同型合子。


疑问句:
Is this organism a homozygote or a heterozygote? = 这个生物是同型合子还是杂合子？
Are all the individuals in this group homozygotes? = 这个群体中的所有个体都是同型合子吗？


否定句:
The individual is not a homozygote; it's a heterozygote. = 该个体不是同型合子；它是杂合子。
The results showed that the plants were not homozygotes for the desired trait. = 结果表明，这些植物并非所需性状的同型合子。
