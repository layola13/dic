词源:
The term "crapshooting" derives from the game of craps, which itself has a complex and debated etymology.  While the exact origin is unclear, it's likely a corruption of the word "crabs," possibly referencing the sideways movement of the dice or a slang term for something crooked or dishonest.  The "-shooting" suffix indicates the action of throwing the dice.
