词源:

The word "evolutility" is a relatively recent coinage, a blend of "evolution" and "utility."  "Evolution" derives from the Latin word "evolutio," meaning "an unrolling,"  referring to the gradual development of something.  "Utility" comes from the Latin "utilitas," meaning "usefulness."  Therefore, "evolutility" combines the concepts of evolutionary development and practical usefulness.
