self-reduction:/selfrɪˈdʌkʃən/| n. | 自归约 |  The process of reducing an instance of a problem to a smaller instance of the same problem. This is a common technique in algorithm design, particularly in proving the tractability of problems.  In self-reduction, a larger problem is broken down into smaller, self-similar subproblems that can be solved recursively or iteratively.  If the reduction process is efficient, then the overall solution becomes efficient as well. | Example:  The problem of finding the maximum element in an unsorted array can be self-reduced by recursively comparing the first element to the maximum element in the rest of the array. | 近义词：recursive reduction | 反义词：None (the opposite concept would be a reduction to a different problem) | 名词
