词源:
The origin of "hookey" in the sense of playing truant is uncertain.  Some etymologists suggest a possible connection to the obsolete word "hook," meaning to steal or snatch, or to a related sense of "hook" as a trick or deception.  Another theory links it to the Dutch word "hoek," meaning "corner," suggesting perhaps a student hiding in a corner to avoid class.  The definitive origin remains unclear, but the association with truancy is well-established.
