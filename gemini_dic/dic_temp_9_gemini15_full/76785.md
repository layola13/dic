词源:

The word "gamified" is derived from the verb "gamify," which is a relatively recent coinage.  "Gamify" itself combines the noun "game" with the suffix "-ify,"  a suffix that means "to make or become." Therefore, "gamify" means "to make something like a game."  "Gamified" is the past participle and adjectival form of "gamify."
