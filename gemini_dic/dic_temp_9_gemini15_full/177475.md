词源：The word "rebelliousness" is derived from the verb "rebel," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "rebell," meaning "to return to war," or "to revolt." This word, in turn, has roots in the Latin prefix "re-" (again, back) and the verb "bellāre" (to wage war).  Thus, the core meaning points to a renewed or repeated state of warfare against authority. The suffix "-ness" is added to transform the adjective "rebellious" into a noun, signifying the quality or state of being rebellious.
