outslander:/ˈaʊtslændər/| n. |局外人，外地人，陌生人 |A person who is unfamiliar or unwelcome in a particular place or group.  It often implies a sense of being excluded or marginalized.| 例句：He felt like an outslander in the small, close-knit community. 他在这个紧密团结的小社区里感觉像个局外人。


The term "outslander" lacks a direct etymological root in the way many words do. It's a relatively modern coinage, formed by combining "out-" (meaning outside or away from) with "lander" (referencing someone belonging to a particular land or region).  The "lander" suffix itself has roots in Old English and Germanic languages, relating to land and inhabitants.  The word doesn't appear in historical dictionaries, suggesting its recent emergence in informal English.
