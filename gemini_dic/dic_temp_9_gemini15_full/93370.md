词源:

The word "illegitimation" is derived from the adjective "illegitimate" and the suffix "-ation," which indicates the process or result of an action.  "Illegitimate" itself comes from the Old French word "illegitime," which is composed of "il-" (meaning "not") and "legitimate" (meaning "lawful," "born in wedlock").  The root ultimately traces back to Latin "legitimus," meaning "lawful."
