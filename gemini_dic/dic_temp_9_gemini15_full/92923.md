英文解析:

The word "identicalnesses" is the plural form of "identicalness," which itself is a noun derived from the adjective "identical."  It refers to the state or quality of being identical; the instances or aspects of things being exactly alike.  While grammatically correct, it's a relatively uncommon word.  The simpler and more frequently used alternative is "identities" or descriptions highlighting the similarities.
