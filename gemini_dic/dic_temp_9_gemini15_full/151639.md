词源:
The word "particularism" is derived from the adjective "particular," meaning "relating to a single or specific person, thing, or instance," combined with the suffix "-ism," indicating a doctrine, system, or practice.  The root traces back to the Latin word "particula," meaning "a small part."  Therefore, particularism essentially refers to a system or practice that emphasizes individual cases or specific circumstances over general rules or principles.
