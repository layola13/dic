词源:  The word "dispassionate" comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the word "passionate". "Passionate" originates from the Latin word "passionātus," the past participle of "passionārī," meaning "to suffer."  Thus, dispassionate literally means "not suffering" or "not feeling strong emotion."
