oxysulphide:/ˈɒksiˌsʌlfaɪd/ | n. | 硫氧化物 | An oxysulfide is a chemical compound containing both oxygen and sulfur anions bonded to a metal cation.  These compounds often exhibit interesting optical and electronic properties.  They are found in various minerals and are also synthesized for use in materials science. | Example:  Many rare earth oxysulfides are being investigated for their potential applications in optoelectronics.  许多稀土硫氧化物正在被研究其在光电领域的潜在应用。 | 近义词:  (Depending on the specific compound) sulfide oxide, oxosulfide | 反义词: None specifically, but the absence of either oxygen or sulfur would define a different compound.
