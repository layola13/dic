词源:

The word "oracularness" is derived from "oracular," which in turn comes from "oracle."  "Oracle" traces back to the Latin word "oraculum," meaning "a sacred shrine where a deity reveals the future," ultimately connected to the Latin verb "orare," meaning "to speak" or "to pray."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, signifying the quality or state of being oracular.
