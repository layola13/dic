词源:
The word "discommodate" comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the word "commodate," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "commodus," meaning "convenient" or "suitable." Therefore, "discommodate" literally means "to make not convenient" or "to make unsuitable."
