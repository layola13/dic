The word "kahani" is not an English word.  It's a word from Hindi and Urdu, meaning "story". Therefore, a standard English word analysis is not applicable.  I can, however, provide information about the word within its native linguistic context.

例句:

*  "Dadi ne ek khoobsurat kahani sunayi." = Grandma told a beautiful story.

*  "Yeh ek sachchi kahani hai." = This is a true story.


近义词: (In Hindi/Urdu)  batai,  qissa,  dastan (These have slightly different nuances, with dastan often implying a longer, more epic tale.)

反义词:  There isn't a direct antonym, as the opposite wouldn't be a "non-story," but rather the absence of a narrative.  One could perhaps use words implying "fact" or "reality" as a contrasting concept, depending on the context.
