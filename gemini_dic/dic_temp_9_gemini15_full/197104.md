词源:
The word "shammy" comes from "chamois," referring to the chamois animal whose soft leather was traditionally used to make these cleaning cloths.  Over time, "shammy" became a shortened and more common term for the cloth itself, regardless of whether it was made from actual chamois leather or a synthetic material.
