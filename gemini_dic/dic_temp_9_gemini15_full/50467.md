词源:

The word "deprehensible" comes from the Late Latin word *deprehendere*, meaning "to catch, seize, detect," which is composed of the prefix *de-* ("down, off, from") and *prehendere* ("to seize, grasp").  The word passed through Middle French and ultimately into English, evolving to its current meaning of deserving condemnation.
