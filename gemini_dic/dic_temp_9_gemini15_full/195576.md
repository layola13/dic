英文解析:The word "semiprofane" combines the prefix "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partly") with the adjective "profane" (meaning "not sacred; irreverent; showing contempt for sacred things").  Therefore, "semiprofane" describes something that is somewhat profane, not entirely so, but still containing elements of disrespect or irreverence towards what is considered sacred or serious.  It implies a less severe or explicit level of profanity compared to outright vulgarity or blasphemy.


例句:

词源:

* **semi-**: From Latin "semi-", meaning "half," "partly," or "incomplete."

* **profane**: From Latin "profanus," meaning "outside the temple," "unholy," or "irreverent."  This ultimately derives from "pro-" (before) and "fanum" (temple).  Thus, something profane is literally "outside the temple" in terms of sacredness.
