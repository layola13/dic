scalenohedral:/ˌskeɪlɪnoʊˈhiːdrəl/| adj. |斜方体形的；不等边体形的 | Relating to or characterized by a scalenohedron.  A scalenohedron is a type of crystal with unequal faces and edges.  The term combines "scalene" (unequal sides) and "hedron" (face).|The mineral calcite can crystallize in a scalenohedral form.|近义词：rhombohedral (in some contexts)|反义词：isometric


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in crystallography and mineralogy.  Therefore, tense usage is limited to descriptions of crystal structures and their properties.  There's no common usage in everyday conversation.  Examples below illustrate the descriptive and defining use.

一般现在时:
Calcite sometimes presents itself in a scalenohedral habit. = 方解石有时呈现斜方体形。
The scalenohedral crystals exhibit distinct asymmetry. = 斜方体晶体表现出明显的非对称性。


一般过去时:
The geologist identified the sample as a scalenohedral variety of quartz. = 地质学家将样本鉴定为一种斜方体的石英。
Scientists previously believed the mineral structure was scalenohedral. = 科学家以前认为这种矿物的结构是斜方体形的。


现在完成时:
Researchers have observed various scalenohedral forms in this mineral deposit. = 研究人员在这个矿床中观察到各种斜方体形状。
Geologists have confirmed that the crystals are indeed scalenohedral. = 地质学家已经证实这些晶体确实是斜方体形的。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, they had suspected a scalenohedral crystal structure. = 在分析之前，他们怀疑是斜方体晶体结构。
It had been previously assumed that the crystals were of scalenohedral habit. = 以前人们认为这些晶体是斜方体形的。


将来时:
Further analysis will determine if the crystals are truly scalenohedral. = 进一步的分析将确定这些晶体是否确实是斜方体形的。
We will investigate the scalenohedral morphology of this newly discovered mineral. = 我们将研究这种新发现矿物的斜方体形态。


虚拟语气:
If the crystals were scalenohedral, they would exhibit specific optical properties. = 如果晶体是斜方体形的，它们将表现出特定的光学特性。
I wish I had known that the specimen was scalenohedral earlier. = 我希望我早点知道标本是斜方体形的。


被动语态:
The scalenohedral form of the crystal was meticulously documented. = 晶体的斜方体形态被仔细记录下来。
The crystal's structure is believed to be scalenohedral, but further studies are needed. = 人们认为该晶体的结构是斜方体形的，但需要进一步的研究。


疑问句:
Is this mineral exhibiting a scalenohedral habit? = 这种矿物是否表现出斜方体形态？
Are the facets of this crystal consistent with a scalenohedral structure? = 该晶体的刻面是否与斜方体结构一致？


否定句:
The crystals are not scalenohedral; they are rhombohedral. = 这些晶体不是斜方体形的；它们是菱面体形的。
The mineral does not display a characteristic scalenohedral morphology. = 该矿物没有显示出特征性的斜方体形态。


PHRASE->
scalenohedral crystal = 斜方体晶体
scalenohedral calcite = 斜方体方解石
scalenohedral form = 斜方体形态
scalenohedral habit = 斜方体习性
scalenohedral structure = 斜方体结构
