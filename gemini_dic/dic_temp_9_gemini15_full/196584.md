词源:

The noun "set-to" originates from the earlier phrase "set to," meaning "to begin" or "to apply oneself to a task." This phrase, dating back to the 16th century, used "set" in the sense of "put" or "place," and "to" as an adverb indicating direction or purpose. Over time, "set to" evolved into the noun "set-to," acquiring its connotation of a vigorous engagement, whether a fight or a work task.  The sense of a fight or argument developed later, likely from the energetic and often confrontational nature of the activities described by the phrase.
