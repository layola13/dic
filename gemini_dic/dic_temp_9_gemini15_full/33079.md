The word "krishna" is not in the English language.  It's a proper noun of Sanskrit origin.  Therefore, a standard English dictionary entry is not possible.  However, I can provide information about its meaning, origin, and usage.


krishna: /ˈkrɪʃnə/ | n. | 克里希纳 | Krishna is a major deity in Hinduism. He is worshipped as the eighth avatar of the god Vishnu and also as the supreme being in his own right.  He is known for his divine playfulness, wisdom, and love. He is often depicted as a dark-complexioned, handsome young man, playing a flute and surrounded by his devotees, the gopis. His story is told in the Bhagavad Gita and other Hindu scriptures. |  The temple dedicated to Krishna is magnificent.  | 近义词: Vishnu (as an avatar), Govinda, Murari | 反义词: (No direct antonyms, as it's a proper noun) | Noun
