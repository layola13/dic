USAGE->

This word is primarily used in a technical context and does not have common usage in everyday conversation.  Therefore, providing examples for all verb tenses would be artificial and unhelpful.  Instead, examples demonstrating its use in different programming scenarios are provided.

Example 1 (Simple assignment):

Before rebinding:
`let myVariable = 10;`  =  在重新绑定之前：`myVariable`变量的值为10

After rebinding:
`myVariable = "hello";` = 重新绑定后：`myVariable`变量的值变为"hello"


Example 2 (Event handling):

A rebindable event handler can be replaced with a new one during runtime.

`function myEventHandler(event) {
  console.log("Original handler:", event);
}

//Later, rebind the handler:
button.addEventListener("click", newEventHandler);` = 一个可重新绑定的事件处理程序可以在运行时用新的处理程序替换。


Example 3 (Data structure):


In a data structure, a node's reference could be rebindable.

`node.next = newNode;` = 在一个数据结构中，节点的引用可以重新绑定。


PHRASE->

There are no common idiomatic phrases using "rebindable."  Its usage is highly specialized within computer science and programming.
