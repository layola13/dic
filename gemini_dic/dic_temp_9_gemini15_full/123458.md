/ˌmɒnəʊˈɔːrɡænɪk/ | adj. | 单器官的；单细胞的 |  Relating to or characterized by a single organ or cell.  The word is a neologism, and its usage is limited, mostly found in scientific contexts.  It combines "mono-" (meaning "one" or "single") and "organic" (referring to living organisms and their structures).  There is no established common usage or readily available examples in general dictionaries. Therefore, providing example sentences, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage in the same manner as a common word is not feasible.  The word needs further contextual information for proper usage illustration.
