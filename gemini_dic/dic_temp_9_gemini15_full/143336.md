词源:
The word "outequivocated" is formed from the prefix "out-" (meaning "completely" or "to a great extent") and the word "equivocated" (meaning "to use ambiguous language").  Therefore, "outequivocated" implies a complete and unambiguous expression, leaving no room for misinterpretation.  The root is from Latin "aequus" (equal) and "vox" (voice), suggesting a balance or equality in the expression, which is contradicted by the prefix "out-".  The addition of "out-" intensifies the meaning to the opposite of equivocation.
