词源:
The word "pinion" ultimately derives from the Latin word "pinna," meaning "feather" or "wing."  Through Old French "pignon" (meaning "wing, pinion"), it entered English, retaining its original sense related to wings and subsequently developing the wider meanings of opinion, gear, and restraint.
