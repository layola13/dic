词源:
The word "intergrappled" is formed by combining the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") with the verb "grappled".  "Grapple" comes from the Middle English "grapelen," ultimately from Old Norse "grepja" meaning "to seize, grasp."  Therefore, "intergrappled" literally means "seized or wrestled with each other".
