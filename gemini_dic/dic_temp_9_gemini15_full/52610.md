词源:

The word "digestibleness" is derived from the verb "digest" + "-ible" (making it an adjective) + "-ness" (turning the adjective into a noun).  "Digest" itself comes from the Latin word "digerere," meaning "to carry apart," "to distribute," or "to dissolve."  This reflects the process of breaking down food.
