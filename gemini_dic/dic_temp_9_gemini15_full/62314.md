词源:
The word "endearment" comes from the verb "endear," meaning "to make dear or beloved."  "Endear" itself is derived from the Old English "ge-dearn," meaning "to make dear," which is composed of the prefix "ge-" and the root "dearn," related to the word "dear."  The "-ment" suffix indicates a state or result of the action. Therefore, "endearment" literally means "the state of being made dear."
