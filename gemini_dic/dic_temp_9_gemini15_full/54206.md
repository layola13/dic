词源:
The word "disfavour" is a combination of the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the noun "favour."  "Favour" ultimately derives from the Old French "favour," meaning "good will," "kindness," or "grace," which in turn originates from the Latin "favor," having the same meanings.  Therefore, "disfavour" literally means "not favour" or the opposite of favour.
