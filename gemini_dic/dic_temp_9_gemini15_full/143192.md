词源：
The word "outcompliment" is a relatively rare word formed by combining the prefix "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent than") and the verb "compliment" (meaning "to praise or express admiration").  It's a relatively modern coinage, not found in older dictionaries, reflecting its infrequent use.
