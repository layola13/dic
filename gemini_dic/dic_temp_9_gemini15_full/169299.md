WORD ORIGIN->
The word "promisingnesses" is derived from the adjective "promising" (full of promise; likely to be successful), which in turn comes from the verb "promise" (to make a commitment or assurance).  The suffix "-ness" is added to transform the adjective "promising" into a noun, denoting the state or quality of being promising. The addition of another "-es" indicates a plural form, referring to multiple instances of promising qualities or potentials.
