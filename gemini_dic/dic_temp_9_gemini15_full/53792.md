词源:
The word "discomposition" is derived from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the noun "composition," which comes from the Latin word "compositio," meaning "a putting together" or "arrangement."  Therefore, "discomposition" literally means "a lack of putting together" or "a state of disarrangement."
