词源:
The word "lounger" derives from the verb "lounge," which entered English in the late 16th century from the Middle French word "lounger," meaning "to loiter" or "to idle."  The noun form, "lounger," developed later, reflecting the act of lounging.  The connection to relaxation and comfortable seating is a natural extension of the verb's meaning.
