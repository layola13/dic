The word "nonassaults" does not exist as a standard English word.  It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, possibly formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") and "assaults" (the plural of "assault").  Therefore, a full analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  However, we can analyze the component parts:


**non-**

/nɒn/ | prefix | 非，不 |  Used as a prefix to indicate negation or absence. |  Examples: non-profit, non-violent, non-existent |  Near synonyms: un-, in-, a- | Antonyms:  pro-, with-


**assaults**

/əˈsɔːlts/ | n. | 袭击；攻击 | An act of attacking someone physically or verbally.  Can also refer to a sudden or violent attack on something non-physical, such as a problem or a task. | Examples:  He was the victim of a brutal assault.  The project was met with an assault of criticism. | Near synonyms: attacks, offenses, aggressions | Antonyms: defenses, protections


Since "nonassaults" is not a word, we cannot provide usage examples, tenses, or phrases.  To illustrate how such a word *might* be used (hypothetically), if it were to be coined, one could imagine it referring to instances of *lack* of assault or instances where an assault *did not* occur.  For example, one might (hypothetically)  say:  "The statistics showed a high number of nonassaults in the community this year," implying a low incidence of assault.  However, this usage remains highly speculative and unconventional.  The proper way to express this would be to use phrases such as "absence of assaults," "non-violent incidents," or similar constructions.
