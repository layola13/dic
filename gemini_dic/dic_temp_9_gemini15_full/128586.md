词源:  The word "nice" has a surprisingly complex etymology. It originates from the Latin word "nescius," meaning "ignorant" or "foolish."  Over time, its meaning evolved through Old French ("nice," meaning "foolish," "silly," or "cowardly") and Middle English, gradually shifting to its current positive connotations.  The transition involved intermediate meanings such as "delicate," "precise," and "subtle," before finally settling on its modern sense of "pleasant" and "agreeable."
