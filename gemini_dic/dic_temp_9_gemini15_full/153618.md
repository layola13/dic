pentatomic:/ˌpentəˈætɒmɪk/| adj.|五原子的|Consisting of five atoms; referring to a molecule composed of five atoms.  Pentatomic molecules can be homonuclear (all atoms the same element) or heteronuclear (atoms of different elements).  Examples include phosphorus (P₄) which is tetra-atomic, not pentatomic; and water (H₂O) which is triatomic, not pentatomic.  A true pentatomic molecule would be something like phosphorus pentoxide (P₄O₁₀) which is a complex molecule with 14 atoms. However, some simplified representations may consider it pentatomic. |The structure of pentatomic molecules can vary greatly depending on the atoms involved and their bonding.|

Examples:
While a perfect example of a simple pentatomic molecule is hard to find, one could discuss the theoretical properties of a hypothetical pentatomic molecule.

A more accurate example would be discussing a pentatomic unit within a larger molecule. For instance, one could analyze a specific five-atom group within a complex polymer chain as a pentatomic unit.
