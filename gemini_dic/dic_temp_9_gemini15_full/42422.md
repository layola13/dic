/ˌkaʊntərkɔːs/ | adj. | 反向交叉的；对立的 |  Countercross is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It appears to be a blend or a newly coined word combining "counter" (against, opposite) and "cross" (intersecting, opposing).  Its meaning would likely derive from the context in which it is used, suggesting something that crosses or opposes another thing in a counter-manner.  For example, it could describe a counter-strategy that intersects with an opponent's plan, or a conflicting pattern that runs opposite to an existing one.  Without a specific context, a precise definition is impossible. |  Example:  "Their countercross marketing campaign directly targeted the competitor's new product line." (假设例句) |  近义词: counter, opposite, contrary, opposing, conflicting | 反义词: parallel, supporting, complementary |  词性: adjective
