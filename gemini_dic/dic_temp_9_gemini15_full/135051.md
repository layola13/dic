nonnormal:/ˌnɑːnˈnɔːrməl/| adj. |非正态的，非常态的|Not conforming to the normal distribution; deviating significantly from the expected pattern or standard.|The data showed a nonnormal distribution, requiring a different statistical analysis.|近义词：abnormal, atypical, irregular|反义词：normal, typical, regular


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The data shows a nonnormal distribution. = 数据显示非正态分布。
This process is nonnormal in its operation. = 这个过程在运行中是非正态的。


一般过去时:
The results indicated a nonnormal distribution. = 结果表明是非正态分布。
The system behaved nonnormally during the test. = 系统在测试期间表现异常。


现在完成时:
Studies have shown that the distribution has been nonnormal. = 研究表明该分布一直是非正态的。
The measurements have revealed nonnormal patterns. = 测量结果显示出非正态模式。


过去完成时:
The analysis showed that the data had been nonnormally distributed. = 分析表明数据先前呈非正态分布。
They had discovered that the system was operating nonnormally before the failure. = 他们在系统故障前发现其运行异常。


将来时:
The upcoming analysis will likely show a nonnormal distribution. = 即将进行的分析可能会显示非正态分布。
We expect the system to behave nonnormally under stress. = 我们预计系统在压力下会表现异常。


虚拟语气:
If the data were nonnormal, we would use a different test. = 如果数据是非正态的，我们将使用不同的检验方法。
It would be helpful if the distribution was truly nonnormal. = 如果分布确实是异常的，那将会有所帮助。


被动语态:
A nonnormal distribution was observed in the experiment. = 在实验中观察到非正态分布。
Nonnormal behavior was detected in the system. = 在系统中检测到异常行为。


疑问句:
Is the distribution nonnormal? = 分布是非正态的吗？
Is the system operating nonnormally? = 系统运行是否异常？


否定句:
The distribution is not nonnormal; it's perfectly normal. = 分布不是非正态的；它是完全正态的。
The system is not operating nonnormally at this time. = 系统目前运行正常。


PHRASE->
nonnormal distribution = 非正态分布
nonnormal data = 非正态数据
nonnormal probability = 非正态概率
nonnormal behavior = 异常行为
