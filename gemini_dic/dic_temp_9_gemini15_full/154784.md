词源：The word "pertinency" is derived from the Old French word "pertinence," which itself comes from the Latin word "pertinēns," the present participle of "pertinēre," meaning "to belong, to extend, to reach."  The Latin root "per" means "through" or "thoroughly," and "tinēre" means "to hold."  Therefore, "pertinency" originally implied something that "holds through" or is thoroughly connected to something else.
