词源:
The word "hazardously" is derived from the adjective "hazardous," which ultimately comes from the Arabic word "azar," meaning "chance" or "luck," particularly bad luck.  The word passed through Old French ("hasard") and Middle English before arriving at its modern form.  The "-ously" suffix indicates an adverbial form, signifying "in a hazardous manner."
