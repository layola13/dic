词源：

源自于英语单词 "exemplary" ，意为“作为模范的；值得效仿的”。  "exemplary"  又源于拉丁语 "exemplaris"，由 "exemplum" (example) 派生而来。


用法说明：

"Exemplarily" is an adverb that describes how something is done. It indicates that the action or accomplishment is done in an exemplary or model way, setting a high standard for others to follow.  It emphasizes the exceptional quality and effectiveness of the action.  It is often used to describe actions, behaviors, or achievements that are worthy of praise and imitation.


注意：

"Exemplarily" is less common than its adjective form "exemplary".  While both convey the same core meaning, "exemplarily" specifically modifies verbs, describing *how* something was done, while "exemplary" modifies nouns, describing the *quality* of something.
