词源:  The word derives from the adjective "relentless," which itself comes from the verb "relent," meaning "to soften or become less severe."  The suffix "-less" negates this meaning, resulting in "relentless," meaning "unyielding" or "unrelenting."  The suffix "-ness" then turns the adjective into a noun, signifying the quality or state of being relentless.  Therefore, "relentlessness" describes the state of being persistent and unwavering, often to an extreme degree.
