词源:
The word "salesmanship" is a combination of "sales" (from Old French *sales, meaning "sale," ultimately from Latin *salis, the genitive of *sal, "salt," referring to the exchange of goods) and "manship" (from Middle English manshyp, meaning "skill, craft," ultimately from Old English mannscipe, "manhood, behavior").  Therefore, it literally means "the skill or craft of sales."
