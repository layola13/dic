词源:
Cornucopia comes from the Latin words "cornu" (horn) and "copia" (abundance).  It refers to the horn of plenty, a symbol of abundance and nourishment in Greek mythology.  The adjective "cornucopiate" is a relatively modern derivation, formed by adding the suffix "-ate" to create an adjectival form.
