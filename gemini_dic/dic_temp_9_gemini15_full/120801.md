词源:  The word "misassembling" is formed by combining the prefix "mis-" (meaning wrongly or badly) with the verb "assembling" (the act of putting together parts or components).  "Assemble" itself comes from the Old French "assembler," from "assembler" (to gather together), ultimately from Latin "ad-" (to) + "semblare" (to resemble, to be like).  Therefore, "misassembling" literally means "wrongly putting together."
