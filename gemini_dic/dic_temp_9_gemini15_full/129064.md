nitrocarbol:/ˌnaɪtroʊˈkɑːrbɒl/ | n. |硝基碳化合物|A nitrocarbol is an organic compound containing both a nitro group (-NO2) and a carbonyl group (C=O).  These compounds are often synthesized through nitration reactions and can exhibit various properties depending on the specific structure. They are commonly used in chemical synthesis as intermediates or building blocks for other molecules, but can also have other applications depending on their specific chemical structure. |Nitrocarbol derivatives are used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other specialty chemicals. |近义词:nitroketone, nitroaldehyde |反义词: (no direct antonym, but compounds without nitro or carbonyl groups could be considered opposite in terms of functional groups)
