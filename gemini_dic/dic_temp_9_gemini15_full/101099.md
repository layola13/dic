inverses:/ˈɪnvɜːrsɪz/ | n. |逆元；反函数；反数 | The mathematical concept of an inverse refers to something that reverses or undoes the effect of another thing.  For example, in arithmetic, the inverse of addition is subtraction, and the inverse of multiplication is division.  In functions, an inverse function reverses the operation of the original function. | Example:  Finding the inverse of a matrix is a common operation in linear algebra. 找到矩阵的逆矩阵是线性代数中的常见运算。  The inverse of the function f(x) = 2x is f⁻¹(x) = x/2. 函数f(x) = 2x的反函数是f⁻¹(x) = x/2。|近义词：reciprocals, opposites |反义词： originals, direct functions |名词
