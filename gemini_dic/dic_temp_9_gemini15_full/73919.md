The word "forswonk" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide a response in the requested format.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific dialect or jargon, or a fictional word.
