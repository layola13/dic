词源:
The word "jinxed" comes from the word "jinx," which is of uncertain origin.  Some etymologists suggest a possible connection to  "jynx," an Old English word meaning a witch or sorceress.  However, the precise etymological pathway remains unclear, with the modern usage developing primarily in the 20th century.
