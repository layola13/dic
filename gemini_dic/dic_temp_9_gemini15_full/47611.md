词源:
From Middle French *débauchement, from débaucher "to debauch," from Old French desbaucher, from des- (variant of dis-) "off, away" + baucher "to toss, to shake" (of unknown origin, possibly related to Old High German bouhhan "to bend").  The meaning evolved from "to dislodge," "to unsettle," to its modern sense of moral corruption.
