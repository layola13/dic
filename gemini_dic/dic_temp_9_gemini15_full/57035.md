double-threaded: /ˈdʌbəlˌθredɪd/ | adj. | 双螺纹的，双线程的 | Having two threads.  This term is used in several contexts, most commonly in textiles and computer science. In textiles, it refers to a fabric or yarn with two threads running parallel. In computer science, it often refers to processes or programs that utilize two threads concurrently. | Example: The double-threaded fabric was incredibly strong and durable.  这条双螺纹织物非常结实耐用。  The software uses double-threaded processing for faster execution. 该软件使用双线程处理以加快执行速度。|近义词: dual-threaded, multi-threaded (in the context of computer science) |反义词: single-threaded (in the context of computer science)
