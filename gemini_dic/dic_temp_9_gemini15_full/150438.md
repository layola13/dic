The word "pantable" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or technical field.

To help, you might want to:

* **Check for spelling errors:** Double-check the spelling.  Is there a similar-sounding or -looking word you intended to use?
* **Provide context:** Where did you encounter this word? Knowing the context (sentence, paragraph, document) will help determine its intended meaning.
* **Consider related words:** Are there any related words that might shed light on the meaning?


Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.
