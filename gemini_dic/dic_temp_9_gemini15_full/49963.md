The word "deniance" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's a misspelling, a newly coined word, or a word from a very specialized field.  If you could provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more informed response.  For example, did you see it in a book, article, or conversation?  Knowing the context would help determine its intended meaning and allow for a proper analysis.
