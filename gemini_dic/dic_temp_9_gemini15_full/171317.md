词源:
From Middle English *pubes, from Old French pube, from Latin pubes (nominative plural pubes), from pubis "adult, man, downy beard," from the Proto-Indo-European root *peu- "to grow."  The word originally referred to the downy hair on the face and body of young men, later specializing in its current meaning.
