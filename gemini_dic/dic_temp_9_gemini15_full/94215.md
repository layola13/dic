词源:
The word "imperforata" is derived from Latin.  "Im-" is a negative prefix meaning "not," "per-" means "through," and "foratus" is the past participle of "forare," meaning "to bore" or "to pierce." Therefore, "imperforata" literally means "not pierced through" or "without holes."

用法说明：
imperforata主要用作形容词，修饰名词，描述物体缺乏孔洞或穿孔的特性。在生物学中，常用来描述某些生物的壳或骨骼结构；在地质学中，则用于描述岩石或土壤的特性。  它通常用于科学文献和技术报告中。  在日常生活中较少使用。
