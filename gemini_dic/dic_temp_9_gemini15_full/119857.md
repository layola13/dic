词源:The word "milepost" is a compound word.  "Mile" comes from the Old English "mīl," meaning "a thousand paces," ultimately derived from the Latin "mille" (thousand). "Post" comes from the Old French "poste," meaning "position," "place," or "post,"  itself from the Latin "positus" (placed).  Therefore, a milepost literally means a post placed at each mile marker.
