词源:
The word "overcommunicated" is a relatively modern term, formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the verb "communicate" and adding the past participle ending "-ed".  "Communicate" itself comes from Latin "communicare," meaning "to share," "to make common," ultimately deriving from "communis," meaning "common."  Therefore, "overcommunicated" literally means "having shared too much information."
