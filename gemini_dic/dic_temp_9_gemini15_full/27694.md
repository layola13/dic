词源:
The word "candlewick" is a compound word.  "Candle" refers to a wax light source, and "wick" is the fibrous material that draws the melted wax up to be burned. The name derives from the original use of this type of thick, loosely spun thread in making candle wicks.  Over time, the term broadened to include the fabric itself that uses this type of thread in its construction.
