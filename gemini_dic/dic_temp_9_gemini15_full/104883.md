词源:
The phrase "keep track" comes from the metaphorical use of "track" meaning "path" or "course."  To "keep track" originally meant to stay on the correct path or course, and has evolved to mean to stay informed or updated on something.  The use of "keep" reinforces the continuous nature of the monitoring.
