The word "preomiting" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word not yet widely accepted.  If you could provide the intended word or more context, I can offer a more helpful response.
