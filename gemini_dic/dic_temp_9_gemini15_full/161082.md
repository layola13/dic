postdentals:/ˌpoʊstˈdɛntəlz/ | n. |后齿音|Postdentals are sounds produced with the tongue contacting the back of the alveolar ridge (the gum ridge behind the upper teeth).  They are a subset of sounds often categorized as alveolo-palatal or postalveolar consonants.  The exact phonetic classification can vary depending on the linguistic framework used.  They are typically fricatives or affricates.  Examples include the "sh" sound in "ship" and the "zh" sound in "measure".| The "sh" sound in "ship" is a postdental fricative. The "ch" sound in "church" is often considered a postdental affricate. |近义词: postalveolar, alveolo-palatal (depending on the specific sound)|反义词:  None directly (it's a category, not a specific sound) |n.


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in linguistic analysis and phonetic descriptions.  Therefore, it doesn't have typical verb conjugations or sentence structures like "what".  Instead, example usages would involve describing sounds:

Example 1:
The English sounds /ʃ/ (as in "ship") and /ʒ/ (as in "measure") are considered postdental fricatives. = 英語的/ʃ/(如"ship")和/ʒ/(如"measure")音被認為是後齒摩擦音。


Example 2:
The articulation of postdental sounds involves placing the tongue slightly further back than for alveolar sounds. = 後齒音的發音涉及將舌頭放置在比齒齦音更靠後的位置。


PHRASE->

There are no common phrases specifically using "postdentals".  The term is highly technical and used within the context of phonetics and phonology.
