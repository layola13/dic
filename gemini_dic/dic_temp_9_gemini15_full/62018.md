enantiopathy:/ɪˌnæntiˈɒpəθi/ | n. |对抗疗法；反向疗法 |  A treatment that uses a substance that has the opposite effect to the condition being treated. This is a relatively rare and specialized medical term, often used in homeopathy and alternative medicine contexts where "like cures like" is challenged by the idea of using opposing remedies.  It involves treating a disease with a substance that produces opposite symptoms.  | Example: The doctor explored the possibility of enantiopathy to treat the patient's persistent inflammation.  | 近义词:  contrary therapy (less specific) | 反义词:  isopathy (same substance treatment), homeopathy (like cures like) |  名词
