renormalization:/ˌriːˌnɔːrməlaɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 重正规化；重整化 | The process of removing infinities from calculations in quantum field theory by systematically redefining the parameters of the theory.  This involves absorbing divergent terms into redefinitions of the coupling constants, masses, and wave functions.  It's a crucial technique to obtain finite and physically meaningful results. | Example: Renormalization is essential for making sense of the predictions of quantum electrodynamics.  重整化对于理解量子电动力学的预测至关重要。 |近义词： regularization | 反义词：无  | 名词

词源:

The word "renormalization" comes from the combination of "re-" (meaning "again" or "anew") and "normalization" (the process of adjusting something to a standard or norm).  The "normalization" part refers to the mathematical process of adjusting values to fall within a specific range or to meet certain criteria. In the context of quantum field theory, it specifically refers to the process of removing infinities from calculations by redefining the parameters of the theory.
