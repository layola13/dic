protomerite:/ˈproʊtoʊˌmaɪraɪt/| n.| 原体；原生体 | A protomerite is a structural unit in some organisms, particularly in certain protozoa, that is considered a fundamental building block of a more complex structure.  It often refers to a segment or part of a cell or organism that may repeat to form a larger structure.  The term is less common in modern biological literature, having been largely replaced by more specific and descriptive terminology.  | Example: The protomerite of this ciliate is clearly visible under the microscope.  这个纤毛虫的原体在显微镜下清晰可见。|近义词：segment, subunit, component |反义词：whole, complete
