词源:

The word "overinstructive" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively"), the noun "instruction" (the act of teaching or guiding), and the suffix "-ive" (forming adjectives meaning "having the nature of" or "tending to").  Therefore, it literally means "excessively giving instruction".
