The word "enmove" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specific technical field or dialect.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer further assistance.
