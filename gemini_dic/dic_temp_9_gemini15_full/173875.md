词源：

* **quasi-**:  from Latin *quasi* meaning "as if," "almost," "like."
* **reconciled**: from  Middle English *reconcilien*, from Old French *reconcilier*, from Latin *reconciliare*, from *re-* (again) + *conciliare* (to bring together, reconcile).


用法说明：

quasi-reconciled is an adjective used to describe a state or relationship where a reconciliation has taken place, but it's not complete or genuine. There's an implication of underlying tension, unresolved issues, or the possibility of future conflict.  It's not a commonly used word, but it's useful in situations where a full reconciliation hasn't been achieved.


(Note:  Because "quasi-reconciled" is a relatively uncommon word,  providing examples of its use in different grammatical tenses is less meaningful than illustrating its core meaning and usage context. The focus should be on understanding its nuanced meaning within a sentence.)
