词源:
The word "multi-partist" is a compound word.  "Multi-" is a prefix meaning "many" or "multiple," derived from Latin "multus" (many). "Parti" comes from the French word "parti," meaning "party," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "pars" (part). "-ist" is a suffix that forms nouns or adjectives referring to persons, things, or doctrines related to something.  Therefore, "multi-partist" literally means "relating to many parties."
