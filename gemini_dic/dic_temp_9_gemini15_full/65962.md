词源:
The word "exaggerated" comes from the verb "exaggerate," which in turn originates from the late Middle English word "exaggarate," borrowed from the Late Latin word "exaggerare."  This Latin word is formed from the prefix "ex-" (out, beyond) and "aggerare" (to heap up, pile up).  Therefore, the original meaning implied piling up or adding to something beyond its proper measure.  The "-ed" suffix transforms the verb into its past participle form, functioning as an adjective in this case.
