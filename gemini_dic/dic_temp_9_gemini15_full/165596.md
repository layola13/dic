The word "prementions" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word not yet widely adopted.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need a correct word.  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word, or could you provide more context where you encountered this word?
