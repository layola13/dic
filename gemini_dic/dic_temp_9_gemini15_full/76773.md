词源:  Derived from the adjective "game," meaning brave, spirited, and courageous.  This sense of "game" is now largely archaic except in this superlative form.  The word "game" in this context is related to Old English *gamen meaning "joy, pleasure, sport," and ultimately to Proto-Germanic *gamaną.  The transition from "joy" to "bravery" likely stems from the association of bravery with spirited competition and the enjoyment of challenges.
