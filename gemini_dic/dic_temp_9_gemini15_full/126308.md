myolemma:/ˌmaɪəˈlɛmə/| n. |肌膜|The myolemma is the plasma membrane of a muscle fiber (myofiber).  It surrounds the sarcoplasm (the cytoplasm of a muscle cell) and regulates the passage of substances into and out of the muscle fiber.  It plays a crucial role in muscle excitation-contraction coupling, and is involved in processes such as action potential propagation and calcium ion regulation. | The myolemma's integrity is essential for proper muscle function. Damage to the myolemma can lead to muscle cell death and various muscular disorders. | 近义词：muscle cell membrane, sarcolemma (often used interchangeably)| 反义词：None directly applicable|  n.
