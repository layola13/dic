The word "loting" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, examples, synonyms, antonyms, or usage examples in the requested format.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), it might be possible to offer a better explanation.
* **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name or place name.
