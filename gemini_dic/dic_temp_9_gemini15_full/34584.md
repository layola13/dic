USAGE->
This word is grammatically unusual.  "Clearness" is a noun, and adding "'s" creates a possessive form, which is rarely used with abstract nouns like "clearness."  Therefore, providing grammatical tense examples is not applicable in the standard way.  The usage would depend heavily on the context.

Example 1:  The project's success hinged on the team's meticulousness and the project manager's clearness's prioritization of tasks.  (Here, "clearness's" awkwardly suggests that the project manager *possessed* a specific instance of clearness which was important to the project's success).

Example 2: The photograph's sharpness, and the scene's clearness's overall effect, were breathtaking. (Here "clearness's" is grammatically unusual but conveys a sense of the scene's clarity contributing to the overall effect).

To avoid such awkward constructions, it is generally better to rephrase using alternative wording, such as:

* The project's success hinged on the team's meticulousness and the project manager's clear prioritization of tasks.
* The photograph's sharpness and the overall clarity of the scene were breathtaking.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "clearness's".  The possessive form is unnatural with this noun.
