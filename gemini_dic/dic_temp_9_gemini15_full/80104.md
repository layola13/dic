词源:
The origin of "gobbledygook" is uncertain, but it's believed to be a blend of onomatopoeia ("gobble," the sound of a turkey) and possibly other nonsense syllables.  The word gained popularity in the mid-20th century, coinciding with increasing public frustration with overly complex bureaucratic language.  It is not derived from a single known root.
