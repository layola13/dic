self-variance:/ˌsɛlfˈveriəns/| n. | 自方差 |  Self-variance refers to the variance of a random variable calculated using only observations from that variable itself, without reference to other variables or external factors. It's a measure of the dispersion or spread of the data points around their mean.  In simpler terms, it quantifies how much the individual data points deviate from the average of the data set.  | Example:  The self-variance of the daily stock prices was high, indicating significant price fluctuations.  自变量每日股价的自身方差很高，表明价格波动很大。|近义词：dispersion, scatter, spread | 反义词：constancy, uniformity

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The self-variance of this dataset is quite high. = 这个数据集的自身方差相当高。
What is the self-variance of the sample mean? = 样本均值的自身方差是多少？


一般过去时:
The self-variance of the experiment's results was unexpectedly low. = 实验结果的自身方差出乎意料地低。
Researchers calculated the self-variance to determine data reliability. = 研究人员计算自身方差以确定数据的可靠性。


现在完成时:
Scientists have determined the self-variance of the phenomenon. = 科学家已经确定了该现象的自身方差。
We have found that the self-variance is significantly affected by external factors. = 我们发现自身方差受外部因素的影响很大。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, they had already calculated the self-variance of the control group. = 在分析之前，他们已经计算了对照组的自身方差。
By that point, they had understood the importance of self-variance in their research. = 到那时，他们已经了解了自身方差在研究中的重要性。


将来时:
We will calculate the self-variance after collecting all the data. = 我们收集所有数据后将计算自身方差。
The researchers will analyze the self-variance to identify outliers. = 研究人员将分析自身方差以识别异常值。


虚拟语气:
If the self-variance were lower, the results would be more reliable. = 如果自身方差较低，结果将更可靠。
It would be helpful if we understood the sources of the high self-variance. = 如果我们了解高自身方差的来源，将会有所帮助。


被动语态:
The self-variance was calculated using a standard deviation formula. = 自身方差是使用标准差公式计算的。
The self-variance is often misinterpreted in statistical analysis. = 自身方差在统计分析中经常被误解。


疑问句:
How is the self-variance affected by sample size? = 样本量如何影响自身方差？
What does a high self-variance indicate about the data? = 高自身方差表明数据有什么特点？


否定句:
The self-variance was not significantly different between the two groups. = 两组之间的自身方差没有显著差异。
The study did not account for the high self-variance in its conclusions. = 该研究在其结论中没有考虑高自身方差。


PHRASE->
