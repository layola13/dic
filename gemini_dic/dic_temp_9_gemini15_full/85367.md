词源:
The word "harrowment" derives from the verb "to harrow," meaning to distress or torment.  The verb itself ultimately comes from the Old English word "heriʒian," meaning "to drag, to rake." This refers to the agricultural practice of harrowing, which involves dragging a heavy harrow (a type of farm tool) across the ground to break up clods of earth.  The metaphorical extension of this meaning to emotional distress reflects the painful and arduous nature of the process.
