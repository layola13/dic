conicities:/ˌkɒnɪˈsɪtiz/ | n. |圆锥度；锥度；锥形度 | Conicities refers to the degree of tapering or the state of being conical. It describes the gradual narrowing of something towards a point, similar to the shape of a cone.  The term is often used in technical contexts, particularly in engineering and geometry, to describe the shape of objects or the variation in dimensions along a length. | The conicities of the rocket nozzle were carefully calculated to optimize thrust. 火箭喷嘴的锥度经过仔细计算以优化推力。The designer considered the conicities of the various parts to ensure a cohesive aesthetic. 设计师考虑了各个部件的锥度，以确保整体美观和谐。 | taper, narrowing |  straightness (反义词较为抽象，难以直接对应)
