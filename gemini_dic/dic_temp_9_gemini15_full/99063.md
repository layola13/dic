interassuring: /ˌɪntərəˈʃʊərɪŋ/ | adj. |互相保证的，互相安慰的 |  This word is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a nonce word, meaning it's created for a specific occasion and isn't found in standard dictionaries. It's likely formed by combining "inter-" (meaning between or among) and "assuring" (meaning to guarantee or comfort). The intended meaning would be something like a mutual act of reassurance or a feeling of mutual comfort and security between parties. | There are no standard examples, as the word isn't established.  A possible example, illustrating the intended meaning, would be:  "Their interassuring glances conveyed a sense of shared confidence." = 他们互相安慰的眼神传达了一种共同的信心。 |  近义词: mutually reassuring, comforting each other, supporting one another | 反义词:  unsettling each other, mutually discouraging, undermining each other |  词性: adjective
