hydroxide:/haɪˈdrɒksaɪd/| n. |氢氧化物|A compound containing the hydroxide ion (OH−). Hydroxides are formed when a metal reacts with water, producing hydrogen gas and a hydroxide solution.  They are typically bases, meaning they have a pH greater than 7.|例句：Sodium hydroxide is a strong base used in many industrial processes. 氢氧化钠是一种强碱，广泛用于许多工业过程。|例句：The presence of hydroxide ions indicates an alkaline solution. 氢氧根离子的存在表明溶液呈碱性。|近义词： alkali (in some contexts)|反义词：acid
