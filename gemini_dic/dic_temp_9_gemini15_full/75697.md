The word "fulimart" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or common usage.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a proper noun (like a brand name), or a word from a specific jargon or dialect.

To provide a response in the requested format, I need a valid English word. Please provide a different word for analysis.
