The word "readorning" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and detailed grammatical explanation are not possible.  To provide a helpful response, we need to consider potential interpretations:


**Possible Interpretations and Analysis:**

It's likely a combination of "re-" (again) and "adorning" (decorating).  If so, we can analyze it as follows:


**1.  If interpreted as "re-adorning":**


/ˌriːəˈdɔːrnɪŋ/ | v. |重新装饰，再次装饰 | Decorating or embellishing something again.  This word would function as the present participle (gerund) of the verb "re-adorn."


* **Etymology:**  "re-" (Old French, meaning "again, back") + "adorn" (Old French *adurner, from Latin *ad-ornāre,  "to equip, furnish").


* **Usage Example:**

* **Word Class:** Verb (present participle)



**Grammatical Considerations (for "re-adorn"):**


This would follow standard verb conjugation patterns.  Below are examples using "re-adorn" which is the base verb.  You can adapt these for "re-adorning" as the gerund.

In summary, without more context, a precise analysis of "readorning" is challenging.  However, assuming it's a combination of "re-" and "adorning," the above analysis provides a reasonable interpretation.  If you have additional context where you encountered this word, providing it would help determine its intended meaning and allow for a more accurate analysis.
