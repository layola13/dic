反义词：romantic, sexual, intimate


词源:  The word derives from the name of the ancient Greek philosopher Plato (Πλάτων, Plátōn), whose writings discussed the ideal of a non-sexual love between men, often interpreted as a model for a higher form of friendship.  This idealized form of friendship became associated with the adjective "Platonic."
