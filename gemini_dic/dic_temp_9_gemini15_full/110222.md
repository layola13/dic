词源:

The word "lifecycle" is a compound word formed from "life" and "cycle".  "Life" comes from Old English *līf, meaning "life, living being". "Cycle" comes from Middle English, ultimately from Late Latin *cyclus, from Greek *kýklos, meaning "circle, wheel, cycle".  Therefore, "lifecycle" literally refers to the circular or recurring stages of life.
