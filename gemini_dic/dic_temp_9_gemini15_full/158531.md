pleonasms:/ˈpliːənæzəmz/ | n. |累赘，冗余，词语重复 |The use of more words than are necessary to convey a meaning; redundancy in expression.  Pleonasms often arise from a desire for emphasis or clarity, but can also result from carelessness or a lack of precision.  They can be stylistic choices, but in formal writing, they are generally considered to be flaws.|例句：The phrase "free gift" is a pleonasm because all gifts are free.  免费礼物这个词组是累赘，因为所有的礼物都是免费的。  Another example is "advance planning," as all planning is inherently done in advance. 另一个例子是“提前规划”，因为所有的规划本来就是在提前进行的。|近义词：redundancy, tautology, superfluity |反义词：conciseness, brevity
