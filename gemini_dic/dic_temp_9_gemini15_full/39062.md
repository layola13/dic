conformator: /kənˈfɔːrmətər/ | n. |构象异构体，构象体 | A molecule that can exist in two or more different conformations.  A conformer is a specific spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule, which can interconvert without breaking any chemical bonds.  Different conformers have different energies, and the most stable conformer is usually the most populated. | Example:  The chair conformation is a more stable conformer of cyclohexane than the boat conformation.  环己烷的椅式构象比船式构象更稳定。|近义词: rotamer (for specific types of conformers)|反义词: N/A
