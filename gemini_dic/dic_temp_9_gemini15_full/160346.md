The word "poost" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. It's a misspelling:  Could you be thinking of another word?  If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it might be possible to guess the intended word.

2. It's a slang term or neologism:  Slang words are often regionally specific or used within particular groups, and therefore may not appear in dictionaries.

3. It's a proper noun:  It could be a name, place, or brand.

4. It's a made-up word:  It might be a word invented for a specific purpose, such as in fiction or a game.
