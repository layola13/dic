microperthite:/ˌmaɪkroʊˈpɜːrθaɪt/| n. |微斜长石|A fine-grained variety of perthite in which the exsolution lamellae of albite are too thin to be resolved with the unaided eye.  It is a type of feldspar mineral composed primarily of alkali feldspar with intergrown lamellae of albite.  The name comes from the fact that it appears as a micro-scale version of perthite.|The thin sections showed microperthite, a variety of alkali feldspar.|近义词:perthite, feldspar|反义词:  None specifically, but contrasting terms could include minerals with different crystal structures or compositions.

词源:
The word "microperthite" is a compound word.  "Micro-" is a prefix meaning "small," derived from the Greek word "mikros" (μικρός). "Perthite" refers to a feldspar mineral with alternating layers of albite and orthoclase, named after Perth, Ontario, Canada, where it was first discovered.  Therefore, "microperthite" describes a variety of perthite where the alternating layers are too small to see without magnification.
