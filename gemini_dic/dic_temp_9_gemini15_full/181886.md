词源:
The word "relying" comes from the verb "rely," which  originates from the Old French word "relier," meaning "to bind back, connect again."  This reflects the idea of being connected to or dependent upon something or someone for support. The "-ing" suffix indicates the present participle form, functioning as a gerund (a verb acting as a noun) or an adjective.
