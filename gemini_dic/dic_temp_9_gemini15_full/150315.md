PHRASE->

There are no common phrases using "pangful" due to its infrequent use.  The word itself is a somewhat intensified version of "painful," so phrases using "painful" could be adapted, but it wouldn't be idiomatic. For instance,  "a painfully slow process" could be theoretically adapted to "a pangfully slow process," but this is not recommended due to the word's archaic nature.
