词源:
The word "comfit" comes from the Old French word "confit," meaning "preserved," "candied," or "sweetmeat."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin "confectus," the past participle of "confingere," meaning "to make up," "to prepare," or "to concoct."  The evolution reflects the historical process of making comfits—candied fruits and sweets were carefully prepared confections.
