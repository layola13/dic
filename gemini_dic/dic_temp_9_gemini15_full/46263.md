cytula:/ˈsɪtʃʊlə/| n. |细胞 |A cytula is a fertilized ovum (egg cell) in the earliest stage of development, before cleavage begins.  It represents the single-celled zygote immediately following fertilization. |Example: The cytula, a single cell, holds the potential to develop into a complex organism.  细胞，一个单细胞，蕴含着发育成为复杂生物体的潜能。|近义词：zygote (受精卵)|反义词：N/A

一般现在时:
The cytula divides rapidly. = 细胞快速分裂。
A cytula contains all the genetic information. = 一个细胞包含所有遗传信息。

一般过去时:
The cytula formed after fertilization. = 受精后形成细胞。
Scientists observed the cytula's development. = 科学家观察了细胞的发育。

现在完成时:
The cytula has already begun to divide. = 细胞已经开始分裂。
Researchers have studied the cytula extensively. = 研究人员已经广泛研究了细胞。

过去完成时:
The cytula had already divided before the observation. = 在观察之前，细胞已经分裂了。
