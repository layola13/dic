The word "hamous" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling: Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a neologism (newly coined word): If it's a newly invented word, more context is needed to understand its meaning and usage.
* It's a word from a specific dialect or technical field: If this is the case, please specify the context where you encountered this word.


Please provide the correct spelling or more context so I can assist you.
