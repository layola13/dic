词源:

The word "disarrangements" is derived from the verb "disarrange," which is formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") to the verb "arrange."  "Arrange" itself has roots in the Old French "arranger," ultimately stemming from the Latin "ad" (to) + "rangare" (to arrange in a row). Thus, "disarrangements" literally means "the state of being not arranged" or "a state of lacking arrangement."
