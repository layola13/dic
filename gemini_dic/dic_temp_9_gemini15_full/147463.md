词源:

The word "overofficiousness" is derived from "officious," which comes from the Latin word "officiosus," meaning "obliging," "kind," or "helpful."  The addition of "over-" indicates an excessive degree, transforming the positive connotation of helpfulness into a negative one of excessive or unwanted meddling.
