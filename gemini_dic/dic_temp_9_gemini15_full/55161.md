词源:
The word "dissemble" comes from the Old French word "dessembler," which means "to un-assemble" or "to separate."  Over time, its meaning shifted to the opposite, signifying the act of concealing or masking something, likely from the idea of separating one's outward appearance from one's inner feelings.  The prefix "dis-" indicates negation or reversal, adding to the sense of hiding or concealing.
