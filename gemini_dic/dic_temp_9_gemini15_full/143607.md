**Hypothetical "outintriguing":**

If someone were to coin the word "outintriguing," it might attempt to convey a meaning similar to "surpassing in intrigue" or "more intriguing than." However, its usage would be highly unusual and context-dependent.  It would need to be defined within the specific context where it's used.


Because "outintriguing" isn't a real word, I cannot provide the requested grammatical usage examples, phrases, etc., as they would be entirely speculative and nonsensical outside a fictional context.  To analyze a word, it must exist and be used within a recognized linguistic framework.
