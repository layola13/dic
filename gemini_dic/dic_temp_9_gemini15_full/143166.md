The word "outcities" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis following your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need to consider possibilities:

**Possibility 1: Misspelling**

The word might be a misspelling of one of the following:

* **Outskirts:** /ˈaʊtskɜːrts/ | n. |郊区，边缘 | The outskirts of the city are less crowded. |城市郊区人比较少。|近义词：periphery, suburbs |反义词：center, downtown

* **Cities:** /ˈsɪtiz/ | n. |城市 | Many large cities have traffic problems. |许多大城市都有交通问题。|近义词：towns, metropolises |反义词：countryside, rural areas


**Possibility 2:  Neologism (New Word)**

If "outcities" is intended as a new word, its meaning would depend entirely on context. It might imply:

* **Cities outside a specific area:**  For example, "The outcities of the metropolitan area experienced slower growth."  This would refer to cities located outside a defined metropolitan region.
* **Cities that are less important/significant:** In a comparative sense, it could denote cities less prominent than a main city or group of cities.
