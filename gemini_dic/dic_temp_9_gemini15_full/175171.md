词源:  The adverb "raggedly" derives from the adjective "ragged," which ultimately comes from the Old Norse word "rögg," meaning "a tuft of hair, a shred, a rag."  This reflects the original meaning of "ragged" as being torn or worn, and hence unkempt.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, signifying "in a ragged manner."
