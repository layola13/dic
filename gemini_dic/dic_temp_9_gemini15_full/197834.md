The word "shinta" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries or etymology resources.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a proper noun, a word from another language, a misspelling, or a neologism (newly coined word).

To provide an analysis, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (a book, website, conversation, etc.)
* **What is the surrounding text or context?** This will help determine its meaning and potential origin.

Once you provide this additional information, I can attempt a more accurate analysis.
