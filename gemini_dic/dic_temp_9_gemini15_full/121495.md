词源:

The word "misleadingness" is derived from the adjective "misleading," which is formed by adding the prefix "mis-" (meaning "wrongly" or "badly") to the present participle "leading."  "Leading" comes from the verb "to lead," meaning to guide or direct.  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun, indicating a state or quality.  Therefore, "misleadingness" literally means "the state of wrongly guiding or directing."
