词源:
The word "overawed" comes from the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great extent) and the verb "awe,"  meaning a feeling of reverence, respect, or fear, often caused by something majestic or powerful.  The root of "awe" is uncertain but may be related to Old Norse words associated with fear or reverence.
