The provided word "{like-to}" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a combination of "like" and "to," often used informally to express a preference or desire.  It doesn't have a dictionary entry as a single lexical unit.  Therefore, a detailed analysis in the requested format is not possible.  Instead, I can provide analyses of "like" and "to" individually, and then show how they function together in the informal expression.


**like:**

/laɪk/ | adj., v., prep., n. | 喜欢，类似，像 | To have a feeling of fondness or affection for someone or something; resembling; similar to. |  I like pizza. 我喜欢披萨。 She looks like her mother. 她长得像她母亲。|  love, enjoy | dislike, hate | adj., v., prep., n.


**to:**

/tuː, tə/ | prep., part. | 到，向，对于 |  Expressing motion in the direction of a place; expressing purpose or intention; infinitive marker. | I went to the store. 我去了商店。 I need to go. 我需要去。| towards, unto | from, away from | prep., part.


**Usage of "like to" (informal):**

The phrase "like to" is used informally to express habitual actions or preferences. It's not grammatically the same as "would like to" which expresses a desire in a specific situation.  It's closer to "tend to" or "usually".


Example:

"I like to go for a walk in the mornings." = 我喜欢早上散步。(This implies it's a regular habit)


This informal "like to" doesn't fit neatly into standard grammatical tense classifications.  It doesn't conjugate like a standard verb.


**Note:** There is no "like-to" entry in standard dictionaries.  The analysis above addresses the individual components and their common informal usage together.
