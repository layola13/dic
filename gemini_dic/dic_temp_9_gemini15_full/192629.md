Etymology:

The word "scurrilousness" is derived from the Middle English word "scurrile," which in turn comes from the Late Latin word "scurribilis," meaning "jesting, buffoonish."  This ultimately traces back to the Latin word " scurra," meaning "buffoon, jester, parasite."  The "-ness" suffix is a common English suffix that transforms adjectives into nouns, indicating a quality or state.  The original sense of jesting and buffoonery evolved over time to encompass the more negative connotations of vulgarity and obscenity that are now central to the word's meaning.
