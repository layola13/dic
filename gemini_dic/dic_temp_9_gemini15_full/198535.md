词源:
The word "shrouder" derives from "shroud," which comes from the Old English word "scrūd," meaning "clothing," "garment," or "covering."  Over time, its meaning narrowed to specifically refer to the cloth used to wrap a corpse.  The "-er" suffix denotes an agent or doer of the action, hence "shrouder" indicating a person who makes or uses shrouds.
