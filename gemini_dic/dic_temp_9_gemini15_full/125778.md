The word "murenger" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical information as requested.  There is no etymology to provide because the word does not exist.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you intended another word. Could you double-check the spelling?
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word, a regionalism, or slang specific to a certain group or context.  If this is the case, please provide more context (where you encountered the word).
* **It's a proper noun:**  It could be a name (person, place, or thing) which would not be found in a general dictionary.

Please clarify the word or provide more context so I can assist you.
