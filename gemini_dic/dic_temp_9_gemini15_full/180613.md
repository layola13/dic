The word "regle" is not a standard English word.  It is likely a misspelling or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis according to your requested format.  To help you, I need clarification:

1. **Is this a misspelling?**  If so, what word were you intending to write?  For example, is it a misspelling of "rule", "regal", or another word?

2. **Is this a word from another language?** If so, please specify the language.  Knowing the language will allow for accurate translation and etymology.


Once you provide this information, I can give you a proper analysis.
