词源:
From Latin *septentrionalis, from septem "seven" + triones "plough oxen" (referring to the seven stars of Ursa Major, the Great Bear, a constellation used for navigation in the Northern Hemisphere).  The seven stars were imagined as oxen pulling a plough, hence the constellation's use in determining north.
