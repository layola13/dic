词源:

The word "fatefully" derives from the adjective "fateful," which in turn originates from the Old English word "fæt," meaning "fate," "destiny," or "what is destined."  The suffix "-ful" signifies "full of" or "characterized by," creating "fateful," meaning "full of fate" or "destined."  The adverbial suffix "-ly" is then added to form "fatefully."  The root "fat" is also related to words in other Germanic languages with similar meanings.
