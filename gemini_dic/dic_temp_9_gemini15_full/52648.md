词源:
The word "digitalize" is derived from "digital," which itself comes from the Latin word "digitus," meaning "finger."  The original sense of "digital" related to counting on fingers.  The suffix "-ize" is a verb-forming suffix indicating "to make or become."  Therefore, "digitalize" means "to make something digital" or "to convert something into a digital format."
