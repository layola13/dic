The word "hounders" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a regional dialect word, or a newly coined word with limited usage.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide a response, I need clarification on what word you intended to use.  If it's a misspelling, please provide the correct word.
