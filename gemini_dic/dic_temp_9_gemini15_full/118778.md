metalloid:/ˈmɛtəlɔɪd/| n.|准金属；类金属|An element that has properties of both metals and nonmetals.  Metalloids are semiconductors, meaning they can conduct electricity under certain conditions but not others. They are often used in electronics.|Example: Silicon is a metalloid used in computer chips. 硅是一种用于计算机芯片的准金属。|近义词: semimetal|反义词:metal, nonmetal

PHRASE->
metalloid semiconductor = 准金属半导体
metalloid element = 类金属元素
metalloid properties = 准金属特性
metalloid character = 类金属特性
metalloid behavior = 准金属行为


词源:
The word "metalloid" is derived from the combination of "metal" and the suffix "-oid," meaning "resembling" or "having the form of."  It reflects the fact that metalloids share some characteristics with metals but also exhibit properties typical of nonmetals.
