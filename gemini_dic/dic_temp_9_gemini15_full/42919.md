covalents: /ˈkoʊvələnts/ | adj. | 共价的 | Describing a chemical bond formed by the sharing of electrons between atoms.  Covalent bonds are a type of chemical bond where two or more atoms share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration. This sharing results in a strong attraction between the atoms, holding them together to form molecules. | Example: Water (H₂O) is a molecule formed through covalent bonds between two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.  | 近义词:shared-electron | 反义词:ionic


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Covalent bonds hold many molecules together. = 共价键结合许多分子。
The atoms share electrons in a covalent bond. = 原子在共价键中共用电子。


一般过去时:
Scientists discovered the nature of covalent bonds. = 科学家发现了共价键的性质。
The experiment demonstrated covalent bonding. = 实验证明了共价键。


现在完成时:
Researchers have studied covalent bonding extensively. = 研究人员已经广泛研究了共价键。
We have learned about covalent compounds in chemistry class. = 我们在化学课上学到了关于共价化合物的知识。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, scientists had not understood covalent bonding. = 在发现之前，科学家们不了解共价键。
They had already completed the study of covalent compounds. = 他们已经完成了对共价化合物的研究。


将来时:
Scientists will continue to study covalent bonds. = 科学家们将继续研究共价键。
We will learn more about covalent chemistry next semester. = 下学期我们将学习更多关于共价化学的知识。


虚拟语气:
If the atoms did not share electrons, there would be no covalent bond. = 如果原子不共享电子，就不会有共价键。
I wish I had understood covalent bonding better in high school. = 我希望我在高中时能更好地理解共价键。


被动语态:
Covalent bonds are formed by sharing electrons. = 共价键是通过共享电子形成的。
The properties of the molecule are determined by the covalent bonds. = 分子的性质是由共价键决定的。


疑问句:
Are all chemical bonds covalent? = 所有化学键都是共价键吗？
How many electrons are shared in this covalent bond? = 这个共价键共享多少个电子？


否定句:
Ionic bonds are not covalent bonds. = 离子键不是共价键。
This molecule does not contain only covalent bonds. = 这个分子不只包含共价键。
