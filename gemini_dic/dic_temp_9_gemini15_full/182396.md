词源:
The word "renege" comes from the Old French word "renegat," meaning "apostate" or "renegade."  This ultimately derives from the Latin "renegare," meaning "to deny again."  The shift in meaning from "to deny" to "to go back on a promise" reflects a semantic evolution where breaking a promise is viewed as a form of denial of one's commitment.
