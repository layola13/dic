endosymbionts:/ˌɛndoʊˈsɪmbaɪɒnts/ | n. |内共生生物 |Organisms that live within the cells or tissues of another organism (the host) in a mutually beneficial relationship.  Endosymbiosis is a long-term biological interaction in which one organism lives inside another, and both organisms benefit from the relationship.  Examples include mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells. |Example:  Mitochondria are considered endosymbionts because they were once free-living bacteria that became incorporated into eukaryotic cells.  线粒体被认为是内共生生物，因为它们曾经是自由生活的细菌，后来被整合到真核细胞中。|近义词：symbionts (更广义的共生生物)|反义词：parasites (寄生生物)


USAGE->
