词源:
The word "scapulary" comes from the Late Latin word *scapulare, which means "of or pertaining to the shoulders." This in turn derives from the Latin word *scapula, meaning "shoulder blade." The religious use of the word evolved from the original meaning, referring to the garment's placement on the shoulders.
