词源:

The word "sculptural" is derived from the noun "sculpture," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "sculptura," meaning "a carving," "sculpture," or "engraving."  "Sculptura" itself is derived from the verb "sculpere," meaning "to carve," "to engrave," or "to sculpt."  The suffix "-al" is added to create the adjective form.
