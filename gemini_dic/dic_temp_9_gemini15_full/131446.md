词源:
The word "noncoercion" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "coercion."  "Coercion" itself comes from the Latin word "coercere," meaning "to restrain, check, keep in."  Therefore, "noncoercion" literally means "not restraining" or "the absence of restraint by force or threat."
