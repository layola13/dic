词源:
The word "shipmaster" is a compound word formed from "ship" and "master".  "Ship" derives from Old English "scip," meaning "ship."  "Master" comes from Old French "maistre," ultimately from Latin "magister," meaning "teacher, master, ruler."  Therefore, "shipmaster" literally means "the master of a ship."
