The word "piccaninnies" is a deeply offensive racial slur. Its origins lie in the colonial era and are rooted in racist stereotypes of Black people.  While etymologically it may derive from a word meaning "small child" in various Aboriginal Australian languages, its adoption and use by colonizers transformed it into a tool of oppression and dehumanization.  Avoid using this word at all costs.  There are many other, respectful ways to refer to children of any race.
