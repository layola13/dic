词源:
The word "encyclopaedia" comes from the Greek words  "enkyklios" (ἐγκύκλιος) meaning "circular" or "general," and "paideia" (παιδεία) meaning "education" or "instruction."  It originally referred to a general course of education encompassing all branches of knowledge.  The word evolved through various forms in Latin and other languages before settling into its current form.
