词源:
The word "hanker" comes from the Middle English word "hankeren,"  meaning "to long for" or "to yearn." This word itself likely has Germanic origins.  "-ers" is a suffix used to create a noun, indicating a person who performs the action of the verb. Therefore, "hankerers" means "those who hanker."
