chilognatha:/ˌkaɪləɡˈnɑːθə/| n. |唇足纲|A subclass of myriapods, characterized by their many legs and the fusion of their mandibles into a single structure called a gnathochilarium.  They are primarily herbivores and detritivores, playing an important role in decomposition and nutrient cycling in their environments.  Examples include millipedes.|例句：The study focused on the diversity of Chilognatha in the rainforest ecosystem. 这项研究集中在雨林生态系统中唇足纲的多样性。|近义词：millipede (as a common example)|反义词：N/A
