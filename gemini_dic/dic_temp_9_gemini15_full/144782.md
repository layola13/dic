over-expresses:/ˌoʊvərɪkˈsprɛsɪz/ | v. | 过度表达，超量表达 | To express (a gene or protein) at a higher than normal level.  This often refers to the production of a gene product (like a protein) in significantly larger quantities than what is typically seen in a normal cell or organism. This can be due to various factors including genetic mutations or experimental manipulation. | The cancer cells over-expresses the HER2 protein.  癌细胞过度表达HER2蛋白。|  hyper-express, upregulate | downregulate, underexpress | 动词
