否定句:
The reaction did not take place in a microsecond; it was much slower. = 反应并没有在一微秒内发生；它慢得多。
The system did not respond within the expected microseconds. = 系统没有在预期的微秒内响应。


PHRASE->
a few microseconds =  几微秒
in microseconds = 以微秒为单位
order of microseconds = 微秒级
within microseconds = 在微秒内
microsecond timer = 微秒计时器

词源:
The word "microsecond" is a compound word.  "Micro-" is from the Greek word "mikros," meaning "small," and "second" refers to the base unit of time.  Therefore, a microsecond is a very small unit of time.
