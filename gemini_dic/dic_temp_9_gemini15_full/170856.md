Instead, it's often due to differential compaction or other tectonic processes.|The sedimentary layers in this formation exhibit a pseudogyrate structure, suggesting a complex deformation history.  这地层中的沉积层呈现出假旋回结构，表明其具有复杂的变形历史。|近义词：pseudo-cyclical, deformed, contorted|反义词：gyrate (in the sense of truly rotational), undeformed, stratified
