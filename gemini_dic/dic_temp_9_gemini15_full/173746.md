词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin "quasi," meaning "as if," "almost," or "like."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation.
* **negligibly**: From "negligible," which comes from the Latin "negligentia," meaning "negligence" or "carelessness."  In this context, it refers to something so small it can be safely ignored.  The "-ly" suffix turns the adjective "negligible" into an adverb.
