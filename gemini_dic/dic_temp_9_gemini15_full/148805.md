overvarieties: /ˌoʊvər vəˈraɪətiz/ | n. | 超变种；过度多样化 |  The term "overvarieties" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism, likely formed by combining "over-" (meaning excessive or too much) and "varieties" (different types or forms).  Its meaning would depend heavily on context, but it likely refers to a situation where there is an excessive or undesirable level of diversity or variation. For example, in biology it might refer to an excessive number of subspecies or variants within a species, hindering classification or study. In linguistics, it could refer to an overwhelming number of dialects or variations of a language.  There are no established usages, synonyms, or antonyms for this word due to its non-standard nature.  Therefore, providing examples of usage in different tenses or grammatical structures is not possible without inventing contexts and interpretations.
