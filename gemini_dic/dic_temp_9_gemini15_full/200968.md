The word "silly" does not follow the prompt's request for a detailed analysis because it is a single word and does not exhibit the grammatical structures and sentence formations requested in the example.  The example is designed for interrogative words like "what."  A single adjective like "silly" cannot be used to illustrate those grammatical structures.

However, I can provide a detailed analysis of "silly" in the requested format:


silly: /ˈsɪli/ | adj. | 傻的；愚蠢的；荒谬的 | Foolish, unwise, or lacking good sense.  Characterized by foolishness or lack of seriousness.  |  例句：That's a silly idea.  = 那是個傻主意。


  That was a silly mistake. = 那是个愚蠢的错误。


近义词：foolish, stupid, absurd, ridiculous, daft, nonsensical | 反义词：wise, intelligent, sensible, clever, smart


USAGE->
This section is not applicable as "silly" is an adjective and cannot be conjugated like a verb.  It modifies nouns.


PHRASE->
silly goose = 傻瓜
silly putty = 橡皮泥
make a silly face = 做鬼脸
feel silly = 感到傻
act silly = 行为愚蠢

词源:  The word "silly" ultimately derives from the Old English word "sely," meaning "happy," "blessed," or "innocent."  Over time, its meaning shifted, evolving to denote a lack of wisdom or good sense, likely through a process of semantic bleaching (loss of original meaning) and then pejorative shift (a change to a negative connotation).  The modern meaning of "silly" solidified in the Middle English period.
