词源:
The word "derange" comes from the Old French word "desrengier," which means "to put out of rank or order."  The prefix "de-" means "away from" or "off," and the root "-range" is related to the Old French word "range," meaning "row" or "order."  Thus, the original meaning of "derange" was to disrupt order or arrangement, which evolved to include the sense of mental disorder.
