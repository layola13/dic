词源:  The word "respected" derives from the verb "respect," which comes from the Old French word "respect," meaning "regard, consideration."  This in turn has roots in the Latin word "respectus," a past participle of "respicere," meaning "to look back at," "to consider," or "to regard."  The suffix "-ed" indicates the past participle or adjectival form.
