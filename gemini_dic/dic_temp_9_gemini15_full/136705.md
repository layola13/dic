This process is nonseismic in nature. = 这个过程本质上是非地震的。


一般过去时:
The researchers investigated nonseismic activity. = 研究人员调查了非地震活动。
The damage was determined to be nonseismic in origin. = 确定损坏的起因是非地震的。


现在完成时:
Geologists have identified several nonseismic hazards. = 地质学家已经确定了几种非地震危害。
Scientists have studied the effects of nonseismic ground deformation. = 科学家们研究了非地震地面变形的影响。


过去完成时:
They had already ruled out nonseismic causes for the land shift. = 他们已经排除了导致土地位移的非地震原因。
It had been previously thought that the phenomenon was nonseismic. = 此前人们认为这种现象是非地震的。


将来时:
Future research will focus on nonseismic land changes. = 未来的研究将侧重于非地震土地变化。
We will explore the nonseismic factors contributing to the instability. = 我们将探讨导致不稳定的非地震因素。


虚拟语气:
If the cause were nonseismic, the damage would be different. = 如果原因是非地震的，损坏将有所不同。
I wish the explanation for the event was simply nonseismic. = 我希望该事件的解释仅仅是非地震的。


被动语态:
Nonseismic factors were considered in the analysis. = 在分析中考虑了非地震因素。
The subsidence was attributed to nonseismic processes. = 沉降归因于非地震过程。


疑问句:
Are the observed changes primarily nonseismic? = 观察到的变化主要是非地震的吗？
Could the ground movement be explained by nonseismic forces? = 地面运动能否用非地震力来解释？


否定句:
The event was not nonseismic; it was clearly an earthquake. = 事件并非非地震的；它显然是地震。
The damage was not caused by nonseismic factors alone. = 损坏并非仅仅由非地震因素造成的。
