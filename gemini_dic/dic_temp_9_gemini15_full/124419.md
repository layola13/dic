Etymology:

The word "motorcade" is a blend of "motor" and "cavalcade."  "Motor" refers to a vehicle powered by an engine, while "cavalcade" comes from the French word "cavalcade," which ultimately derives from the Italian "cavalcata," meaning a ride on horseback.  The original meaning of "cavalcade" was a procession of horsemen, but it evolved to include any procession of vehicles.  The combination creates a word specifically denoting a procession of motor vehicles.
