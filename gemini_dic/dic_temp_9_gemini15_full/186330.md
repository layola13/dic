rhotacism:/ˈroʊtəˌsɪzəm/ | n. | 齿龈颤音化；卷舌音化；r音化 | The substitution of a sound for /r/, especially the substitution of another consonant or a vowel for /r/.  This can manifest as a speech impediment or a phonetic shift in a language's evolution.  For example, a person with rhotacism might pronounce "red" as "wed" or "led".  It can also refer to a historical linguistic change where a sound other than /r/ becomes /r/.|Example:  The pronunciation of "card" as "cad" is an example of rhotacism.  齿龈颤音化的一个例子是把“card”读作“cad”。  Another example is the historical rhotacism in some dialects of English where the intervocalic /l/ has become /r/, as in the pronunciation of "milk" as "mirk".  另一个例子是某些英语方言中历史上的齿龈颤音化，其中元音间的 /l/ 变成了 /r/，例如将“milk”读作“mirk”。 |近义词:  r-coloring, r-substitution,  |反义词:  None specifically, but the antonym would be the *absence* of rhotacism, or the correct pronunciation of /r/ sounds.
