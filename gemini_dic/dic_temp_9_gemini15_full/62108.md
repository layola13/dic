词源:

* **enchantress:**  This word is derived from the verb "enchant," which itself has a rich history.

* **enchant:**  It comes from the Old French "enchanter," which combines the prefix "en-" (meaning "in" or "into") and "chanter" (meaning "to sing" or "to chant").  Originally, "enchanter" referred to the act of putting someone under a spell through singing or chanting.  The implication of magic and captivating influence is inherent in the original meaning.

* **-ess:** The suffix "-ess" is a feminine suffix, indicating the female form of a word.  It is added to the stem "enchant" to create "enchantress," signifying a female practitioner of enchantment.
