词源:
The word "role" comes from the Old French word "rolle," meaning "scroll" or "roll of parchment."  This refers to the practice in medieval times of writing down the parts of a play on scrolls.  Over time, the meaning shifted to refer to the part played by an actor, and subsequently to a more general sense of a part or function someone has in a situation.
