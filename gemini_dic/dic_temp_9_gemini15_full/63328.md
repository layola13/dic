词源:
The word "entitle" comes from the Old French word "entitler," which itself is derived from the Latin word "intitulāre."  "In-" is a prefix meaning "in" or "into,"  "titulus" means "title."  Thus, the original meaning was to give a title to something.  Over time, the meaning broadened to include the granting of rights or privileges.
