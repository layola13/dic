词源:
The word "remembering" comes from the Old English word "gemǣnan," which means "to make common," implying that something is brought to mind and shared in consciousness.  Over time, this evolved into the Middle English "remembren," and finally to the modern English "remember."  The "-ing" suffix indicates the present participle or gerund form, denoting the act or process of remembering.
