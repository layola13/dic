词源:

* **inter-**:  prefix meaning "between," "among," or "reciprocally."
* **trans-**: prefix meaning "across," "through," or "beyond."
* **lat-**:  relating to the Latin word "latus," meaning "carried" or "brought."
* **-able**: suffix meaning "capable of" or "worthy of."
* **-ity**: suffix forming nouns of quality or state.

Therefore, intertranslatability literally means "the capability of being carried or brought across (languages) reciprocally."
