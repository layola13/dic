The word "readvocated" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a neologism,  a newly coined word or expression.  It's likely formed by combining "re-" (again) and "advocated" (to publicly support or recommend a cause or policy).  Therefore, a proper analysis as requested is not possible.  To provide a response that follows the requested format, we need to analyse a real word.  Let's use "advocated" instead.

advocated: /ˈædvəkeɪtɪd/ | v. | 提倡；主张；拥护 | To publicly recommend or support a particular cause or policy. |  She advocated for stricter gun control laws. 她主张更严格的枪支管制法。 | supported, championed, promoted | opposed, resisted, condemned | Verb
