The word "presuspected" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  To help you, I need clarification.  Is it possible you meant a different word?  Perhaps you could provide more context where you encountered this word.
