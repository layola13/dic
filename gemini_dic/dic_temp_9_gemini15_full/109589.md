USAGE->
This word is a relatively uncommon noun and doesn't have common usage in different tenses like verbs.  The grammatical structures would be used in sentences *about* lethalnesses, rather than with lethalnesses itself as the main verb.  Therefore, tense examples are not applicable in the same way as with a verb.

例句1：The study examined the lethalnesses of different toxins on various animal species. 这项研究检查了不同毒素对各种动物物种的致死性。
例句2：The report highlighted the varying lethalnesses of the chemicals used in the manufacturing process. 报告强调了制造过程中使用的化学品的不同致死性。

例句2： degree of lethalness 致死程度
例句3： potential lethalness 潜在致命性
