eutexia:/juːˈtɛksiə/| n. |共晶; 共熔|The lowest temperature at which a mixture of substances can exist as a liquid.  It is the point at which a mixture of two or more substances melts or solidifies at a single temperature, rather than over a range of temperatures. This is because the solid and liquid phases have the same composition at this point.|例句：The eutectic point of water and salt is significantly lower than the freezing point of pure water.  水和盐的共晶点远低于纯水的冰点。


例句：Understanding eutexia is crucial in metallurgy for creating alloys with specific melting points. 了解共晶在冶金学中对于创造具有特定熔点的合金至关重要。
