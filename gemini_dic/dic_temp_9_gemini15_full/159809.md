polygons:/ˈpɒlɪɡɒnz/ /ˈpɑːlɪɡɑːnz/ | n. |多边形 |A polygon is a plane figure with at least three straight sides and angles.  It is a closed figure, meaning that all the sides are connected.  The sides can be of different lengths, and the angles can be of different sizes. | Examples: Triangles, squares, pentagons, hexagons are all polygons.  The stop sign is an octagon, a type of polygon. |近义词：multi-sided figure |反义词：circle, curve


USAGE->
一般现在时:
This shape is a polygon. = 这个形状是一个多边形。
These polygons are similar in shape. = 这些多边形的形状相似。


一般过去时:
We studied polygons in geometry class. = 我们在几何课上学习了多边形。
He drew a polygon on the whiteboard. = 他在白板上画了一个多边形。


现在完成时:
She has identified all the polygons in the diagram. = 她已经识别出图中所有的多边形。
We have learned about the properties of polygons. = 我们已经学习了多边形的特性。


过去完成时:
They had already calculated the area of the polygon before the presentation. = 他们在演示之前就已经计算出多边形的面积了。
I had never seen such a complex polygon before. = 我以前从未见过如此复杂的多边形。


将来时:
We will draw different types of polygons tomorrow. = 我们明天将绘制不同类型的多边形。
She will explain the angles of polygons in detail. = 她将详细解释多边形的角度。


虚拟语气:
If this were a regular polygon, its sides would be equal. = 如果这是一个正多边形，它的边长将相等。
I wish I understood the formulas for calculating the area of irregular polygons. = 我希望我能理解计算不规则多边形面积的公式。


被动语态:
The polygon was divided into smaller triangles. = 多边形被分成较小的三角形。
The areas of the polygons are being calculated by the computer. = 多边形的面积正在由计算机计算。


疑问句:
Is this figure a polygon? = 这个图形是多边形吗？
How many sides does this polygon have? = 这个多边形有多少边？


否定句:
This shape is not a polygon; it has a curved side. = 这个形状不是多边形；它有一条曲线边。
That figure is not a regular polygon because its sides are unequal. = 那个图形不是正多边形，因为它的边长不相等。


PHRASE->
regular polygon = 正多边形
irregular polygon = 不规则多边形
convex polygon = 凸多边形
concave polygon = 凹多边形
polygon mesh = 多边形网格
