constatives:/ˈkɒnstətɪvz/ | n. | 陈述句；描述句 | Statements that describe or report facts, as opposed to performatives which perform actions.  Constatives are traditionally considered verifiable as true or false. However, this distinction is debated in philosophy of language.  | Example: "The cat is on the mat." is a constative statement.  | 近义词:descriptive statements, assertions | 反义词:performatives


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in philosophical discussions and doesn't have typical grammatical tenses like "what" does.  Therefore, providing example sentences in various tenses is not applicable.  Instead, we will illustrate its usage in different contexts within philosophical discourse.


Example 1 (Truth value):
"The Earth is round." is a constative statement; its truth can (in principle) be verified. = “地球是圆的”是一个陈述句；它的真假原则上是可以验证的。


Example 2 (Contrast with performatives):
"I promise to pay you back." is a performative utterance; it doesn't describe a fact, but performs the act of promising.  In contrast, "I made a promise to pay you back" is a constative statement describing a past action. = “我答应还你钱”是一个施为句；它并不描述一个事实，而是执行了许诺的行为。相比之下，“我答应还你钱”是一个陈述句，描述了过去的行为。


Example 3 (Verifiability debate):
The verifiability of constatives is a complex issue. Statements like "God exists" are traditionally considered constatives, but their truth is difficult to empirically verify. = 陈述句的可验证性是一个复杂的问题。“上帝存在”传统上被认为是陈述句，但其真假难以经验证明。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "constatives" as it's a technical philosophical term.  The term itself is the phrase.
