词源:
Latenesses is the plural form of lateness, derived from the adjective "late".  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating a state or quality.  "Late" itself has Old English roots, tracing back to words meaning "hidden," "secret," or "slow."  The evolution to its modern meaning of "after the expected or proper time" happened gradually.
