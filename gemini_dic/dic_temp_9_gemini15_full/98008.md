词源:

The word "inoperative" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "operative," which derives from the verb "operate."  "Operate" ultimately comes from the Late Latin word "operari," meaning "to work," "to labor," or "to act."


用法说明：

Inoperative is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that is not functioning correctly or at all. It often implies a temporary state, but it can also describe something permanently broken or disabled.  It is frequently used in technical contexts to describe machinery, equipment, or systems that are not working as intended.  It can also be used in a more figurative sense to describe something that is ineffective or powerless.
