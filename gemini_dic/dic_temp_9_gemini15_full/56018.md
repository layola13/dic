词源:

* **do:**  This is a common English verb meaning "to perform an action." Its origins trace back to Proto-Germanic *dōn, and ultimately to Proto-Indo-European *dʰeh₁- "to put, to do."

* **bidding:** This is a noun form of the verb "bid," meaning "to offer (a price), to command, to invite."  "Bidding" thus refers to the commands or requests being made.  The verb "bid" comes from Old English *biddan, related to words meaning "to pray" or "to ask."  The sense of command evolved from the idea of making a formal request or invitation.
