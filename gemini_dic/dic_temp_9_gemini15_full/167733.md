词源:
The word "prigger" likely originated as a slang term, possibly derived from the verb "prig," meaning to steal or pilfer, which itself has uncertain origins but may be related to Middle English words suggesting stealth or sly behavior.  Its use to describe a meddlesome person is a later development.
