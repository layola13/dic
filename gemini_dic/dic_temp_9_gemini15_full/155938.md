photoelectric-cells:/ˌfoʊtoʊɪˈlɛktrɪk sɛlz/| n.|光电管;光电电池|A photoelectric cell is a device that converts light energy into electrical energy.  It works based on the photoelectric effect, where photons of light strike a material and cause the emission of electrons. This flow of electrons generates an electric current.  The current produced is proportional to the intensity of the light shining on the cell.|例句：Solar panels are made up of many photoelectric cells. 太阳能电池板由许多光电电池组成。|例句：The photoelectric cells in the streetlight automatically turn on at dusk. 街灯里的光电电池在黄昏时自动开启。|近义词：photocell, light sensor|反义词：N/A

词源:
photo-  (from Greek phōs, phot-), meaning "light"
electric-  (from Greek elektron), meaning "amber" (originally referring to static electricity)
-cell  (from Latin cella), meaning "small room," "chamber"

The term combines the action of light ("photo-") creating an electrical effect ("-electric-") within a contained unit ("-cell").
