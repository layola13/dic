reentrant:/ˈriːeɪntrənt/ | adj. | 可重入的，可递归的 |  Able to be re-entered or called again before a previous call has completed;  specifically referring to a subroutine or function that can be interrupted during its execution and safely called again without causing conflicts or undefined behavior.  This typically requires that the subroutine doesn't modify global variables or use static data in a way that would be corrupted by concurrent calls. |

例句：
The reentrant code is crucial for multitasking operating systems.  可重入代码对于多任务操作系统至关重要。

The function is designed to be reentrant, ensuring thread safety. 该函数设计为可重入的，以确保线程安全。

词源:The word "reentrant" is formed from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") and the word "entrant," which itself is derived from the verb "enter."  Thus, "reentrant" literally means "able to be entered again." The specific technical meaning evolved in the context of computer programming and subroutine calls.
