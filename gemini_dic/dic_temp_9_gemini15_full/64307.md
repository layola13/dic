英文解析:

The word "equivocalnesses" is the plural form of "equivocalness," which refers to the state or quality of being equivocal.  Equivocal means open to more than one interpretation; ambiguous.  Therefore, "equivocalnesses" highlights the multiple instances or aspects of ambiguity or uncertainty present in something.

词源:

The word derives from the Latin "aequus" (equal) and "vox" (voice).  The combination suggests a situation where two or more "voices" or interpretations are equally possible.  Through Old French, this evolved into the English "equivocal," and subsequently, "equivocalness" and "equivocalnesses."
