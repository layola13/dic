词源：

The word "monotoned" is derived from the word "monotone," which itself comes from the Greek words "monos" (single) and "tonos" (tone).  It originally referred to a single musical tone, but has expanded to describe anything lacking variety or interest.


用法说明:

"Monotoned" is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that is characterized by a lack of variation or interest.  It is often used to describe sounds (like voices or music), but can also be applied to describe things like landscapes, tasks, or even personalities.  It implies a sense of dullness and repetitiveness.  It's less common than "monotonous," but conveys a similar meaning with an emphasis on the tonal aspect.
