词源:
The word "pumpernickel" is of German origin.  Its etymology is somewhat uncertain, but it's likely a compound word. One theory suggests it derives from "pumpen" (to pump or puff up) and "nickel" (a small coin or a diminutive form of "Nicholas"), perhaps referencing the bread's size or the price.  Another theory suggests a connection to "Pumper," a type of rye grain.  Its origins remain debated among etymologists.
