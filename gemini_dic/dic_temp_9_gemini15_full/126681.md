词源:

The word "namby-pamby" itself is of uncertain origin, but it's generally believed to be a whimsical or invented word, possibly onomatopoeic, meaning something weak or soft.  Its first recorded use was by Henry Carey in the early 18th century.  It's believed to be a playful alteration of words implying weakness or childishness.  The "-y" and "-by" suffixes contribute to the sense of childishness and weakness.  The precise etymology remains debated.
