WORD ORIGIN->
The word derives from "quenchable," meaning capable of being quenched or satisfied.  Adding "-ness" creates the noun form "quenchableness,"  meaning the state or quality of being unquenchable. The plural "-nesses" indicates multiple instances of this quality.  The root "quench" comes from Old English "quenchen," meaning to extinguish or put out (a fire, thirst, etc.).
