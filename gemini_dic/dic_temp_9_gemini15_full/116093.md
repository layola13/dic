词源:
The word "martyrize" comes from the word "martyr," which originates from the Greek word "μάρτυς" (martys), meaning "witness."  Early Christians who died for their faith were called martyrs because their deaths were seen as a testament to their beliefs.  The verb "martyrize" developed later, taking on the meaning of inflicting suffering similar to that experienced by martyrs.
