morula:/ˈmɔːrjuːlə/| n. |桑椹胚|A morula is an early stage embryo, appearing as a solid ball of cells (blastomeres) resulting from cleavage of a fertilized egg.  It is formed after the zygote undergoes several rounds of cell division without significant growth in overall size. The morula stage precedes the blastocyst stage of embryonic development. |Example: After fertilization, the zygote rapidly divides to form a morula.受精后，受精卵迅速分裂形成桑椹胚。|近义词：early embryo |反义词：blastocyst (in terms of developmental stage)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The morula stage is crucial for early embryonic development. = 桑椹胚阶段对早期胚胎发育至关重要。

疑问句:
What are the characteristics of a morula? = 桑椹胚的特征是什么？
How many cells are typically found in a morula? = 桑椹胚通常有多少个细胞？

否定句:
The zygote did not develop into a morula. = 受精卵没有发育成桑椹胚。
There was no visible morula in the sample. = 样本中没有观察到明显的桑椹胚。
