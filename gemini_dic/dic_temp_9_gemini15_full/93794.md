词源:
The word "immerse" comes from the Latin word "immergere," which is a compound of "in-" (in, into) and "mergere" (to dip, to plunge).  Therefore, the original meaning directly relates to submerging something in a liquid.  Over time, the meaning extended to include the figurative sense of being deeply involved or engrossed in something.
