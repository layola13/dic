equiatomic:/ˌɛkwɪəˈætɒmɪk/| adj. |等原子比的，等原子数的 | Having equal numbers of atoms of each constituent element.  This term is typically used in the context of alloys or compounds where the different elements are present in a 1:1 ratio. For example, an equiatomic alloy of gold and copper would contain an equal number of gold and copper atoms. | Example: The equiatomic NiTi alloy exhibits shape memory effect. 等原子比的镍钛合金表现出形状记忆效应。|近义词：stoichiometric (in the context of a 1:1 ratio) |反义词：non-equiatomic
