prehandicapped:/ˌpriːˈhændɪkæpt/| adj.| 预先残疾的，先天残疾的 |  Describes a condition or disability present from birth or very early in life.  This term is now considered outdated and potentially offensive due to its negative connotations and ableist language.  It implies a pre-determination of a person's capabilities based on a disability.  More appropriate and respectful terminology focuses on the individual and their abilities, rather than labeling them by their disability. | Example: The child was prehandicapped with cerebral palsy. (This sentence is outdated and should be avoided. A better phrasing would be: "The child was born with cerebral palsy.") | 近义词: congenitally disabled, born with a disability | 反义词: able-bodied, healthy |  词性: adjective
