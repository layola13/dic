WORD ORIGIN->

The word "semi-empirical" is a combination of two elements:

* **semi-**:  A prefix meaning "half," "partly," or "partially."  It comes from Latin "semi-," itself from "sex" meaning "six" (half of twelve).

* **empirical**:  An adjective meaning "based on observation or experience rather than theory or pure logic." It comes from the Greek word "empeirikos," meaning "experienced," from "empeiros," meaning "skilled," "expert."


Therefore, "semi-empirical" literally means "partly based on experience or observation."
