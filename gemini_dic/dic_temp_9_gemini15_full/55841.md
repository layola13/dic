The word "dividuuous" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis as requested.  To help you, I need clarification on the intended word.  Is it a misspelling of a known word?  Could you provide context where you encountered this word?
