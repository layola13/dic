The term describes a structure composed of thin, flat layers or plates, often overlapping like the plates of a fish's scales.  |例句：The gills of many fish are lamelliform, allowing for efficient gas exchange.  许多鱼的鳃是片状的，允许高效的气体交换。

The microscopic structure of the bone showed a lamelliform arrangement of collagen fibers. 骨骼的微观结构显示出胶原纤维的片状排列。


近义词：lamellar, plate-like, foliate|反义词：tubular, cylindrical, acicular


词源: From Latin *lamella ("thin plate") + -form ("having the form of").  The Latin word lamella itself is a diminutive of lamina ("thin plate, layer").
