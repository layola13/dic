词源:
The word "evade" comes from the Old French word "evader," which means "to escape, to avoid."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "evadere," which combines the prefix "e-" (out) and the verb "vadere" (to go).  Therefore, the original meaning literally translates to "to go out" or "to get away."
