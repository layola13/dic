词源:
The word "photographing" comes from the noun "photograph" and the suffix "-ing," which indicates the present participle (or gerund) form of a verb.  "Photograph" itself is a combination of "photo" (from Greek *phos, "light") and "graph" (from Greek *graphein, "to write").  Therefore, "photographing" literally means "the act of writing with light."
