词源:  The word "gangling" ultimately derives from the Old English word "gang," meaning "to go" or "to walk."  Over time, this evolved into a sense of moving awkwardly or clumsily. The "-ling" suffix adds a diminutive or descriptive element, suggesting something small or somewhat underdeveloped but also awkward.  The connection to awkward gait and movement solidified the meaning we use today.
