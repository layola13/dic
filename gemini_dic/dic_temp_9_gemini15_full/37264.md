The word "comini" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a slang term or neologism:  If it's a newly coined word or used within a specific community, providing context would be helpful.
* It's from another language: If it's from a different language, please specify the language so a translation and analysis can be attempted.


To help me provide the analysis you're looking for, please clarify the word's origin and context.
