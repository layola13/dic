liquefaction:/lɪˈkwæfækʃən/ | n. |液化；液化作用 |The transformation of a substance from a solid or gaseous state into a liquid state.  Liquefaction is a process that can occur naturally or be induced artificially.  Examples include the melting of ice or the condensation of steam. In geology, it refers to the process by which water-saturated sediments lose strength and behave like a liquid during an earthquake. |例句：The intense heat caused the liquefaction of the metal.剧烈的热量导致金属液化。

The earthquake caused soil liquefaction, leading to building collapses. 地震引起土壤液化，导致建筑物倒塌。|近义词：melting, fusion, condensation |反义词：solidification, freezing
