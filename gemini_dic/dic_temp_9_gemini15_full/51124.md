词源:
The word "despise" comes from the Old French word "despiser," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "despicere," meaning "to look down upon" or "to scorn."  The prefix "de-" means "down," and "specere" means "to look."  Thus, the word's origin literally reflects the act of looking down on someone or something with contempt.
