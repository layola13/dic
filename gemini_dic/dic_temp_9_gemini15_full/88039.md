The term "highbrow" originated in the early 20th century as a slang term.  It is a metaphorical expression, contrasting with "lowbrow," suggesting that those with superior intellectual tastes are perceived as having their foreheads higher than those with more commonplace preferences.  The term's use reflects social stratification and distinctions in cultural tastes.
