meson:/ˈmeɪsɒn/| n. |介子|A meson is a subatomic particle composed of one quark and one antiquark, bound together by the strong interaction. Mesons are hadrons, meaning they are made up of quarks. They are unstable and decay rapidly into other particles.  Different mesons have different masses and properties, depending on the types of quarks they contain.  They play a crucial role in understanding the strong nuclear force and the structure of matter. | Example: The discovery of the pion, a type of meson, was a significant milestone in particle physics. 介子的发现，一种介子，是粒子物理学中的一个重要里程碑。 |近义词: hadron |反义词: lepton
