naplessnesses:/ˈneɪplɪsnɪsəz/ | n. | 无毛的状态（复数）| The state of being without nap (a short sleep).  This word is extremely rare and almost never used in everyday conversation or writing. It's essentially the plural of "naplessness," which itself is uncommon. The word emphasizes the multiple instances or aspects of lacking a nap or nap-like qualities, perhaps in different contexts or for different things. | Example: The naplessnesses of the long journey left the travelers exhausted. (旅程中的多次无法小睡让旅行者们筋疲力尽。) | 近义词:  (No direct synonyms exist, as the word is so unusual.  One might use phrases like "repeated lack of naps," "instances of sleep deprivation," or "multiple periods without rest" to convey a similar meaning.)| 反义词: (The antonym would involve the opposite of a lack of naps;  phrases like "opportunities for rest," "frequent naps," or "periods of sleep" would be more appropriate.) | 名词


USAGE->
This word is so rare that providing grammatical examples across different tenses is impractical and misleading.  It's important to understand that the word itself is not commonly used and would sound highly unnatural in most contexts.


PHRASE->
No common phrases exist using "naplessnesses."  The word's rarity precludes its use in common phrases.
