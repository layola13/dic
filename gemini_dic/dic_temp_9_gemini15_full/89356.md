homomorphism:/ˈhɒməmɔːrfɪzəm/ | n. | 同态映射 | A homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures (such as groups, rings, or vector spaces) of the same type.  It preserves the operations defined on these structures. For example, a group homomorphism preserves the group operation (e.g., addition or multiplication). | Example:  The map f: Z → Z₂ defined by f(x) = x mod 2 is a homomorphism from the group of integers under addition to the group of integers modulo 2 under addition.  This is because f(x + y) = (x + y) mod 2 = (x mod 2) + (y mod 2) = f(x) + f(y). |近义词: structure-preserving map |反义词:  (No direct antonym, but a map that doesn't preserve the structure would be a counter-example) |无
