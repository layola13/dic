pharyngobranchii:/ˌfærɪŋɡoʊˈbræŋkiˌaɪ/| n. |咽鳃弓|  The pharyngobranchii are the gill arches located in the pharynx of certain animals, particularly fishes. They are skeletal structures that support the gills and play a role in respiration and feeding.  | Example: The study focused on the development and morphology of the pharyngobranchii in larval zebrafish.  这项研究侧重于斑马鱼幼虫咽鳃弓的发育和形态。|近义词: gill arches, branchial arches |反义词:  (no direct antonym,  but contrasting structures might include operculum or jaws)|名词
