词源:  The word "inharmonic" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "harmonic," which comes from the Greek word "harmonikos" (harmonious). "Harmonikos" itself is derived from "harmonia," meaning "agreement" or "fitting together." Thus, "inharmonic" literally means "not harmonious."
