homotropal: /hoʊmoʊˈtroʊpəl/ | adj. | 向性相同的；正向的 |  Referring to a tropism where the direction of the response is the same as the direction of the stimulus.  For example, in positive phototropism, the plant grows towards the light source (the stimulus and response are in the same direction).  | Example:  The plant exhibited homotropal growth towards the sunlight.  植物表现出向阳光生长的正向性。 | 近义词：orthotropic (in some contexts) | 反义词：plagiotropic,  diageotropism (depending on the specific tropism) |


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in botany and related scientific fields, so the grammatical examples below will reflect that context.  General grammatical usage follows standard English rules.

一般现在时:
The roots demonstrate homotropal growth towards gravity. = 根系表现出向地性的正向生长。
The shoots exhibit homotropal response to light. = 茎表现出对光的正向反应。


一般过去时:
The seedlings showed homotropal behavior. = 幼苗表现出正向行为。
The experiment demonstrated homotropal responses in the plants. = 实验证明了植物的正向反应。


现在完成时:
Researchers have observed homotropal growth in many species. = 研究人员已在许多物种中观察到正向生长。
Scientists have documented homotropal responses to various stimuli. = 科学家已经记录了对各种刺激的正向反应。


过去完成时:
Before the light source was changed, the plants had shown homotropal growth. = 在改变光源之前，植物已经表现出正向生长。
The researchers had expected to see homotropal responses, but they were surprised. = 研究人员曾预计会看到正向反应，但他们感到惊讶。


将来时:
We will observe homotropal growth in the next phase of the experiment. = 我们将在实验的下一阶段观察正向生长。
The study will investigate homotropal responses to different wavelengths of light. = 该研究将调查对不同波长光的正向反应。


虚拟语气:
If the stimulus were stronger, the response would be more homotropal. = 如果刺激更强，反应将更具正向性。
It is hypothesized that if the conditions were ideal, the plant growth would be completely homotropal. = 假设如果条件理想，植物生长将完全正向。


被动语态:
Homotropal growth was observed in the control group. = 在对照组中观察到正向生长。
Homotropal responses to gravity are often studied in plants. = 植物的向地性正向反应经常被研究。


疑问句:
Is the growth pattern homotropal or plagiotropal? = 生长模式是正向的还是斜向的？
Does the plant show a purely homotropal response to light? = 植物对光线是否表现出纯粹的正向反应？


否定句:
The growth was not entirely homotropal; some plagiotropism was observed. = 生长并非完全正向；观察到一些斜向生长。
The response to the stimulus was not homotropal in all cases. = 并非在所有情况下对刺激的反应都是正向的。


PHRASE->
There are limited common phrases directly using "homotropal," as it's a technical term.  Phrases would typically describe the *type* of homotropal growth or response observed, not use "homotropal" as a core element of a phrase.  Examples of related phrases might include:
Positive homotropism
Negative homotropism
Homotropal growth response
Homotropal root development
Directional homotropal movement
