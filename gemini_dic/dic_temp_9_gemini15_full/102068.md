isonicotine: /ˌaɪsoʊˈnɪkoʊtiːn/ | n. | 异烟碱 | Isonicotine is a pyridine alkaloid found in tobacco and other plants. It is a structural isomer of nicotine, differing only in the position of a methyl group. It's less toxic than nicotine, but still possesses some pharmacological activity.  | Example: Studies have shown that isonicotine is present in varying concentrations in different tobacco varieties.  | 近义词:  (structural isomers of nicotine,  requires more specific context for true synonyms)| 反义词: (no direct antonym)| 名词
