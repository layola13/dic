词源:
The word "selflessness" is derived from the word "selfless," which combines the prefix "self-" (meaning "of or relating to oneself") and the suffix "-less" (meaning "without").  Therefore, "selfless" means "without self," implying a lack of concern for oneself. Adding the suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "selfless" into the noun "selflessness," signifying the quality or state of being selfless.
