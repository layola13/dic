词源:The word "kersey" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "kersey," which in turn likely originated from a place name in the Netherlands, possibly referring to a region known for producing this type of cloth.  The exact etymology is debated, but the connection to cloth production in the Low Countries is widely accepted.
