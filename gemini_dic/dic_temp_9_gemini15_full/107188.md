They are characterized by their large incisors, which continue to grow throughout their lives. They are herbivores and are found in a variety of habitats around the world. | Example:  The study focused on the evolutionary history of the Lagomorpha order. 这项研究的重点是兔形目的进化史。  The classification of the species into Lagomorpha was confirmed by genetic analysis.  物种被归类为兔形目这一分类结果得到了基因分析的证实。|近义词: None (as it's an order, not a species)|反义词: None (as it's an order, not a species)|名词
