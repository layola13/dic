The word "nonepically" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word, or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are not possible.  To provide a response in the requested format would be inaccurate and misleading.

To help, we could analyze what the word *might* mean based on its apparent construction:

It seems to be formed by combining "nonepi-" (possibly intended as a negative prefix related to "epic") and "-ically" (an adverbial suffix).  Therefore, a possible interpretation (though not a standard word) would be "not in an epic way," or "unepicly," "unheroically," or "in a non-grand manner."

If you can provide context where you encountered this word, it might be possible to offer a more precise interpretation and suggest appropriate synonyms.
