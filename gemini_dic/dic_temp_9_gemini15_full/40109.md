The word "contek" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a word from a specific jargon, slang, or a proper noun (like a brand name).

To provide a helpful response, I need more context. Where did you encounter this word? Knowing the source will help determine its meaning and potential origin.
