protovertebra:/ˌproʊtoʊˈvɜːrtɪbrə/ | n. | 原生椎体，原椎 | A protovertebra is a paired segmental structure in the early embryonic development of vertebrates.  These structures are precursors to the definitive vertebrae. They are formed during the process of somitogenesis and eventually fuse or differentiate to form the adult vertebral column.  Research on protovertebrae is crucial for understanding the development of the spine and related congenital anomalies. | Example:  Studies on chick embryos have provided valuable insights into the formation and segmentation of protovertebrae.  鸡胚胎的研究为了解原生椎体的形成和分节提供了宝贵的见解。| 近义词:somite (in the context of early vertebral development) | 反义词: vertebra (fully formed)


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a scientific context, specifically in embryology and developmental biology.  Therefore, its usage in different tenses is largely restricted to descriptions of the developmental process.  Examples below are illustrative, not exhaustive.

一般现在时:
Protovertebrae form in the early stages of embryonic development. = 原生椎体在胚胎发育的早期阶段形成。
The researcher observes the segmentation of the protovertebrae under the microscope. = 研究人员在显微镜下观察原生椎体的分节情况。

一般过去时:
The scientists studied how protovertebrae fused to form vertebrae. = 科学家研究了原生椎体如何融合形成椎骨。
The experiment demonstrated the role of specific genes in protovertebrae formation. = 实验论证了特定基因在原生椎体形成中的作用。

现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several genes involved in protovertebrae development. = 研究人员已经确定了几个参与原生椎体发育的基因。
Scientists have extensively studied the morphology of protovertebrae in various species. = 科学家已经广泛研究了各种物种中原生椎体的形态。

过去完成时:
Before the fusion, the protovertebrae had already undergone significant changes. = 在融合之前，原生椎体已经发生了显著的变化。
Once the somitogenesis was complete, the protovertebrae had begun to differentiate. = 一旦体节发生完成，原生椎体就开始分化。

将来时:
Future studies will likely focus on the molecular mechanisms regulating protovertebrae formation. = 未来的研究可能会侧重于调控原生椎体形成的分子机制。
Researchers will investigate the relationship between protovertebrae defects and spinal abnormalities. = 研究人员将调查原生椎体缺陷与脊柱异常之间的关系。
