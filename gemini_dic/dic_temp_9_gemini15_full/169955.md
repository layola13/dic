词源:
The word "prostrator" is derived from the verb "prostrate," which comes from the Late Latin word *prostratus*, the past participle of *prosternere*.  *Prosternere* is composed of the prefix *pro-* (forward) and *sternere* (to spread, to throw down).  Therefore, the original meaning relates to throwing oneself forward to the ground.  The evolution to its religious connotation happened over time.
