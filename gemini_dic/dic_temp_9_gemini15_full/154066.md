periblast:/ˈpɛrɪblæst/| n. |周缘盘，胚周细胞|The periblast is a region of cytoplasm surrounding the yolk in the egg of certain animals, such as insects and some fish.  It plays a role in early embryonic development.  In insects, the periblast is involved in the formation of the extraembryonic membranes. | Example: The periblast in Drosophila embryos contributes to the formation of the serosa.  果蝇胚胎中的周缘盘有助于浆膜的形成。|近义词: yolk, germ plasm|反义词:  embryo (in the context of being the central developing structure)|词性 n.


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the field of developmental biology and embryology, so common grammatical tenses and sentence structures are less relevant than the context of its use in scientific writing.  Therefore, I will provide examples related to its use in scientific papers and explanations.

Example 1 (Passive Voice): The periblast was observed to migrate towards the developing embryo. 周缘盘被观察到迁移到发育中的胚胎。

Example 2 (Present Tense):  The periblast functions in nutrient transport to the embryo. 周缘盘的功能是向胚胎运输营养物质。

Example 3 (Past Tense):  Researchers studied the role of the periblast in yolk absorption. 研究人员研究了周缘盘在卵黄吸收中的作用。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "periblast" as it is a highly specialized scientific term.  Phrases would typically be composed of  "periblast" combined with descriptive terms within the context of developmental biology such as: "periblast migration," "periblast development," "periblast formation," "periblast differentiation," "periblast function".
