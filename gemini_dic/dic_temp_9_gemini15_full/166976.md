词源:

The word "prestudious" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and the adjective "studious" (meaning "devoted to study; diligent").  Therefore, it literally means "studious beforehand" or "having studied beforehand".  The word's origin traces back to the Latin word "studere" (to study), which further contributes to the meaning of diligent study.
