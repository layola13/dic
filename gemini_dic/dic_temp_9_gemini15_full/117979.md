词源:
The word "memorably" is derived from the adjective "memorable," which in turn comes from the Old French word "memorable," meaning "worthy of being remembered."  The ultimate origin traces back to the Latin word "memorabilis," formed from "memorare" (to remind, to mention) + "-bilis" (capable of).
