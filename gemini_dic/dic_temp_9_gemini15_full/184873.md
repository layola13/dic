词源:  The word "retackling" is formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") to the verb "tackling," which itself originates from the noun "tackle," meaning "equipment" or "to grapple with."  The original meaning related to handling ropes and equipment on a ship, but has evolved to mean addressing a problem or challenge.
