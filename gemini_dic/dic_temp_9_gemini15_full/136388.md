nonrestricting: /ˌnɒn.rɪˈstrɪktɪŋ/ | adj. | 非限制性的，无限制的 |  A nonrestrictive element adds extra information to a sentence but is not essential to its grammatical structure.  It is usually set off by commas, dashes, or parentheses.  It provides additional detail or clarification about something already mentioned. |


例句：

My brother, who lives in London, is a doctor.  我的哥哥住在伦敦，是一名医生。(The information about him living in London is extra; the sentence would still be grammatically correct without it.)

The book, which I borrowed from the library, was very interesting.  我从图书馆借的那本书很有趣。(The source of the book is extra information.)
