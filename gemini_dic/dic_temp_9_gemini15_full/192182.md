词源:

The adverb "scrapingly" derives from the verb "scrape," which ultimately originates from Old English *scroppian, meaning "to scratch or scrape."  The addition of "-ing" forms the present participle, and the further addition of "-ly" transforms it into an adverb, modifying the manner in which an action is performed.  The sense of humility and servility arises from the image of scraping or bowing low to please someone.
