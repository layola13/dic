词源:
The word "packet" ultimately derives from the Old French word "pacquet," meaning "bundle" or "package."  This, in turn, has roots in the Latin word "paccus," meaning "a pack" or "bundle."  The modern English usage reflects this original sense of a container or bundle of items, extended to the digital realm of data transmission.
