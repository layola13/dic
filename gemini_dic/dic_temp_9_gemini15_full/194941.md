词源:
The word "semi-major" is a compound word.  "Semi-" is a prefix derived from Latin "semi-" meaning "half" or "partly". "Major" is derived from Latin "maior" meaning "greater" or "larger".  Therefore, "semi-major" literally means "half-greater" or "partially greater", but in the context of ellipses, it refers to the longer of the two axes.
