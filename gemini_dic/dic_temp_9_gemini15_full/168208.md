pro-Eskimo: /ˌproʊˈɛskɪmoʊ/ | adj. | 亲爱斯基摩人的；支持爱斯基摩人的 |  Supporting or favoring the Eskimo people; showing approval or advocacy for their interests and well-being.  The term is now considered outdated and potentially offensive, as it implies a patronizing or paternalistic attitude towards the indigenous people of the Arctic.  It's preferable to use more respectful and accurate terms like "Inuk" (singular) or "Inuit" (plural) when referring to people from Inuit communities.
