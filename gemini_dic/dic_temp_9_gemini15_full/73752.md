词源:  The word "forlornest" comes from the Middle English word "forloren," meaning "lost," "abandoned," or "deserted."  This, in turn, derives from the Old English "forloren," a past participle of "forleosan," meaning "to lose."  The "-est" suffix indicates the superlative degree, signifying the highest or most extreme degree of the adjective.
