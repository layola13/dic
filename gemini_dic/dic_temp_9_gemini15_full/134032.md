nonhyperbolic:/ˌnɒnˌhaɪpəˈbɒlɪk/| adj.|非双曲线的，非双曲型的|Not exhibiting hyperbolic properties; lacking the characteristics of a hyperbola.  This term is primarily used in mathematics, specifically in geometry and dynamical systems.  It describes systems or shapes that do not possess the properties of a hyperbola, such as constant negative curvature in geometry or specific divergence behaviors in dynamical systems.|The nonhyperbolic system exhibited stable behavior over time.  非双曲系统随着时间的推移表现出稳定的行为。


The Poincaré map of this nonhyperbolic fixed point is not easily understood. 这个非双曲不动点的庞加莱映射不容易理解。|近义词：non-hyperbolic|反义词：hyperbolic
