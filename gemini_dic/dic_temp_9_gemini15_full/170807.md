词源:

* **pseudo-**:  From Greek *pseudēs*, meaning "false," "sham," or "counterfeit."
* **electoral**: From *elect*, ultimately from Latin *eligere*, meaning "to choose" or "to select."  The suffix *-al* forms an adjective.

Therefore, *pseudoelectoral* literally means "falsely relating to elections" or "sham election-related."
