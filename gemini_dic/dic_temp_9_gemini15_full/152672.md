/piːkiʃnəsiz/| n. |古怪之处；奇特之处；最高点；顶峰；|The word "peakishnesses" is not a standard English word. It seems to be a nonce word, formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" (meaning "qualities or states") to "peakish," which itself is an informal adjective meaning "somewhat like a peak or summit; slightly peaked or pointed."  Therefore, it likely refers to the various odd or unusual characteristics or qualities associated with something that is slightly peaked or pointed, or perhaps to the multiple instances of such qualities.  It lacks a clear and established meaning in standard dictionaries.|例句：The artist's work displayed a series of strange peakishnesses, unexpected angles and sharp protrusions.  (这位艺术家的作品展示了一系列奇怪的尖锐之处，意想不到的角度和尖锐的突出部分。)  |近义词：eccentricities, peculiarities, oddities, quirks |反义词：normalities, regularities, commonalities |名词
