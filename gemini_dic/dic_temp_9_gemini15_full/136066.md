This word is a plural form, derived from "nonreceptive" and then adding the plural "-nesses" suffix.

* **nonreceptive:**  This is an adjective formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "receptive."

* **receptive:** This comes from the verb "receive," ultimately from the Old French "receivre" and Latin "recipere" (to take back, receive).  It means "willing or able to receive and accept something."

Therefore, "nonreceptivenesses" refers to multiple instances or states of being unreceptive, unwilling, or unable to receive or accept something.  The word is quite rare and often considered overly formal or cumbersome.  Simpler alternatives usually exist.

The word itself doesn't lend itself to grammatical tense variations in the way verbs do.  The grammatical function is solely that of a noun in the plural.  It would be used in sentences similarly to other plural nouns describing states or qualities.  Because of its rarity, providing examples of usage across different tenses is impractical and would be artificial.

PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "nonreceptivenesses" due to its rarity.  Instead, phrases would use synonyms.  For example:

* **instances of resistance:**  抵抗的例子
* **signs of unresponsiveness:**  冷漠的迹象
* **a wall of rejection:** 一堵拒绝的墙
* **refusal to engage:** 拒绝参与


Note:  The word "nonreceptivenesses" is a very uncommon word.  In most contexts, a simpler, more readily understood alternative would be preferred.
