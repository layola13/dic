近义词: anticipatory, proactive, preemptive, preventative


反义词: reactive,  unprepared,  unforeseeing


词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "pre-" (before) + "concessive" (yielding; admitting).  "Concessive" itself comes from the Latin "concedere" (to yield, grant).  Therefore, "preconcessive" literally means "yielding or admitting beforehand."
