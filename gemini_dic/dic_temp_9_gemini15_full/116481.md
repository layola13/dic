词源:  The word "materialistically" derives from the adjective "materialistic," which itself comes from "materialism."  "Materialism" is formed from "material" (meaning relating to physical matter) + "-ism" (a suffix indicating a doctrine or system of belief).  Therefore, the word's roots trace back to the concept of prioritizing physical matter and possessions.
