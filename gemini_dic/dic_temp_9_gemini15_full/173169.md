词性：形容词

USAGE->  (由于quasi-audibly本身是形容词，没有动词变化，故此部分略去)


PHRASE-> (由于quasi-audibly本身是形容词，没有常用词组，故此部分略去)

词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation.

* **audibly**: From "audible," derived from Latin *audibilis*, meaning "hearable," from *audire*, "to hear."

Therefore, "quasi-audibly" combines the sense of "almost" or "nearly" with the ability to be heard, resulting in its meaning of being almost, but not quite, loud enough to be clearly heard.
