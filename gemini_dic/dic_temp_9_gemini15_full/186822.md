词源:

The term "ring-fenced" is a relatively modern coinage, originating in the late 20th century. It's a figurative use of "ring-fence," where "ring" refers to a circle and "fence" to an enclosure. The imagery suggests creating a protected boundary around something.  The precise origin is difficult to pinpoint, but its usage became widespread in the context of budgetary allocations and financial management.
