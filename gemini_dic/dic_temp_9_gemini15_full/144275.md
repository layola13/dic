词源:
The word "outsourced" is a relatively modern word, formed from the verb "outsource" which is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning "outside" or "beyond") and the noun "source."  The meaning evolved from the practice of obtaining goods or services from external sources, which became increasingly common with globalization and the rise of specialized service providers.
