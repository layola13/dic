Etymology:

The word "sea-borne" is a compound word formed from "sea" and "borne".

* **Sea:**  From Old English *sēo, *sæ,  from Proto-Germanic *saiwiz,  ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *séli-.  This root refers to bodies of water, especially the sea.

* **Borne:**  The past participle of the verb "bear," meaning to carry.  This comes from Old English *boren, from Proto-Germanic *beraną,  and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *bher- (to carry, bear).
