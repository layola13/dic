词源:
The word "demobilized" comes from the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "reverse") and the word "mobilized".  "Mobilized" in turn originates from the word "mobile" (capable of movement), ultimately stemming from the Latin word "mobilis".  Therefore, "demobilized" literally means "to reverse the process of mobilization".
