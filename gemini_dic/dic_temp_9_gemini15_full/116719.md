词源:  The word's origin is ultimately from Mary Magdalene, a follower of Jesus in the New Testament.  In medieval art, she was often depicted weeping profusely, leading to the association of her name with excessive sentimentality.  The word evolved from a sense of excessive piety to its current meaning.
