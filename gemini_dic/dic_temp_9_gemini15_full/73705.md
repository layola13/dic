词源:

The word "forgo" is a combination of the Old English prefix "for-" (meaning "completely" or "away") and the Old English verb "gan" (meaning "to go").  Therefore, the original meaning literally meant "to go away from" or "to do without".  Over time, the meaning evolved to its current sense of willingly giving something up.
