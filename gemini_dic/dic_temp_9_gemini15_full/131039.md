USAGE->
This word is so rare and complex that providing examples across all verb tenses is impractical and unnatural.  The word itself is a highly specialized term used in specific academic contexts (e.g., political science, systems theory).  Illustrative sentences would focus on its core meaning.


Example Sentences:


*   The study highlighted the various nonautonomousnesses that characterized the region's political landscape.  这项研究突出了该地区政治格局中存在的各种非自主性。

*   Overcoming the inherent nonautonomousnesses within the organization proved to be a significant challenge. 克服组织内在的各种非自主性被证明是一个巨大的挑战。



PHRASE->
Because "nonautonomousnesses" is a rarely used word, providing common phrases is not relevant.  The word functions as a standalone noun describing a complex condition.
