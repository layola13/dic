The word "respreading" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  It appears to be a newly coined word, or a very rare and specialized term.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and detailed grammatical explanation are impossible.  However, we can infer its meaning and possible usage based on its constituent parts.

/ˌriːˈspredɪŋ/ | adj.  | 再传播；重新传播 |  The word "respreading" combines "re-" (meaning again or anew) and "spreading" (the act of extending or distributing something over a wider area). It suggests the act of spreading something again, or spreading it to a new or wider audience after an initial spreading. |


Example (hypothetical, as this is not a standard word):

The respreading of misinformation on social media is a serious concern. =  社交媒体上虚假信息的再次传播令人担忧。


Near Synonyms (depending on context):  redistribution, retransmission, dissemination, propagation


Antonyms:  containment, suppression, restriction


Because "respreading" is not a standard word, providing grammatical examples in various tenses and moods is not meaningful.  The word would be treated grammatically like other "-ing" words, possibly as a gerund (noun) or present participle (adjective).
