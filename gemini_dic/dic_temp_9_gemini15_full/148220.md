词源：

The word "oversight" comes from the Old English word "ofersīht," which literally meant "looking over" or "supervision."  The "over" prefix indicates a position of authority or control, while "sight" refers to observation or perception. The modern meaning evolved from the original sense of supervision to encompass instances where a lack of observation leads to an error or mistake.
