The word "minations" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word not yet widely accepted.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need a correctly spelled word.  Please provide the correct spelling, and I will happily provide the analysis.
