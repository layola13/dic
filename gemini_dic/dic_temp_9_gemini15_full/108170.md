词源:  The word "latrine" comes from the French word "latrine," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "lavare," meaning "to wash."  While seemingly counterintuitive, the connection lies in the Roman practice of using latrines as places for washing and cleaning, in addition to their primary function.  The term evolved to specifically refer to a toilet facility, particularly in military contexts.
