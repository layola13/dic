词源:

The word "pawning" comes from the Old French word "pan" meaning "pledge" or "guarantee."  This ultimately derives from the Latin word "pannus," meaning "cloth," as pledges were originally often made using cloth.  The transition to the modern sense of pawning an item for a loan developed over time.
