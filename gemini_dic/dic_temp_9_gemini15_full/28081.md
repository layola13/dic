capillary:/ˈkæpɪləri/| n.|毛细血管；毛细管；细管|A capillary is a tiny blood vessel that connects arteries and veins.  Capillaries are responsible for the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between the blood and the body's tissues.|例句：Blood flows through the capillaries to deliver oxygen to the cells. 血液通过毛细血管向细胞输送氧气。|例句：The experiment used a capillary tube to measure surface tension. 实验使用毛细管测量表面张力。|近义词：vessel, tube|反义词：artery, vein|名词
