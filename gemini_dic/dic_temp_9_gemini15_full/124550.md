词源:

The word "mountebank" originates from the Italian phrase "monta banca," which literally translates to "mounts a bench."  Historically, mountebanks would set up their stalls on benches in public squares to sell their wares and perform their tricks.  The word evolved through French ("montebanc") before entering English.
