photoheterotrophic:/ˌfoʊtoʊˌhɛtərəˈtroʊfɪk/| adj. |光能异养的|  An organism that uses light as an energy source but obtains carbon from organic compounds.  These organisms are capable of photosynthesis, but unlike photoautotrophs, they cannot use carbon dioxide as their sole carbon source and require pre-formed organic molecules.  | Example:  Many purple non-sulfur bacteria are photoheterotrophic.  许多紫色的非硫细菌是光能异养的。| 近义词:photoorganotrophic | 反义词:photoautotrophic, chemoautotrophic, chemoheterotrophic


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The purple bacteria are photoheterotrophic. = 紫细菌是光能异养的。
This organism uses light for energy and organic compounds for carbon. = 这个生物利用光作为能量，利用有机化合物作为碳源。


一般过去时:
The researchers found that the bacteria were photoheterotrophic. = 研究人员发现这些细菌是光能异养的。
The experiment showed that the organism required organic carbon sources. = 实验表明该生物需要有机碳源。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified many photoheterotrophic species. = 科学家们已经鉴定了许多光能异养物种。
This research has significantly advanced our understanding of photoheterotrophy. = 这项研究极大地促进了我们对光能异养的理解。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, little was known about photoheterotrophic metabolism. = 在这一发现之前，人们对光能异养代谢知之甚少。
They had already established that the organism was not autotrophic. = 他们已经确定该生物不是自养的。


将来时:
Further research will explore the diversity of photoheterotrophic organisms. = 今后的研究将探索光能异养生物的多样性。
Scientists will likely discover more photoheterotrophic species in extreme environments. = 科学家们可能会在极端环境中发现更多光能异养物种。


虚拟语气:
If the organism were photoautotrophic, it would not require organic carbon. = 如果该生物是自养的，它就不需要有机碳。
I wish we had more data on the photoheterotrophic metabolism of this species. = 我希望我们有更多关于该物种光能异养代谢的数据。


被动语态:
Many photoheterotrophic species have been identified in various ecosystems. = 在各种生态系统中已经鉴定了许多光能异养物种。
The metabolic pathways of photoheterotrophs are currently being studied. = 目前正在研究光能异养生物的代谢途径。


疑问句:
Is this bacterium photoheterotrophic or photoautotrophic? = 这种细菌是光能异养的还是光能自养的？
What are the key characteristics of photoheterotrophic organisms? = 光能异养生物的主要特征是什么？


否定句:
This organism is not photoheterotrophic; it is chemoheterotrophic. = 此生物不是光能异养的；它是化能异养的。
The experiment did not confirm that the species was photoheterotrophic. = 该实验并未证实该物种是光能异养的。
