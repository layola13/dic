词源:
The word "profanities" derives from the word "profanity," which comes from the Late Latin word *profanitas*, meaning "profane" (common, secular, not sacred).  The suffix "-ities" denotes a plural form.  The root meaning connects to the idea that these words are considered unholy or disrespectful to sacred things, hence their taboo nature.
