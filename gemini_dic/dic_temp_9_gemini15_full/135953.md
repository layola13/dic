词源:
The word "nonpursuant" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "pursuant" (meaning "in accordance with," "following," or "conforming to").  "Pursuant" itself derives from the past participle of the verb "pursue," ultimately from the Old French "pursuer" and Latin "prosequi" (to follow, to prosecute).
