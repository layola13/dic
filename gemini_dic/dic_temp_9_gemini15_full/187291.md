The name "Rochester" originates from the town of Rochester in Kent, England.  The name itself is believed to derive from the Old English elements "Hroðcēaster," meaning "Hroðgar's fortress" or "Hroðgar's Roman fort."  Hroðgar was a legendary king in Anglo-Saxon tradition.  Many places in the United States, including the prominent city in New York, were named after this English town, carrying the same historical etymology.
