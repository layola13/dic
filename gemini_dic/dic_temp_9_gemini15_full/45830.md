词源:
The word "customizable" is derived from the word "customize," which itself is a combination of "custom" and the suffix "-ize."  "Custom" originates from Old French "costume," meaning "manner, habit, fashion," ultimately from Latin "consuetudo" (habit, custom). The suffix "-ize" is a verb-forming suffix indicating "to make or become." Therefore, "customizable" means "capable of being made into a custom or specific form."
