/ˌhaɪpərˌræʃəˈnælətiz/ | n. | 超理性思维方式；过度理性化 |  The study of hyperrationalities explores the potential pitfalls of excessive rationality in decision-making.  This field examines situations where an overreliance on logic and data can lead to suboptimal or even harmful outcomes.  It delves into cognitive biases and limitations that arise when individuals or groups prioritize pure rationality above other important factors like intuition, emotions, and social context.  Hyperrationalities often manifest in overly complex strategies, rigid adherence to plans, and a neglect of unforeseen circumstances.  |  例句：The company's downfall was attributed to its hyperrationalities, as their meticulous planning failed to account for unforeseen market fluctuations. 公司的倒闭归因于其过度理性的思维方式，因为他们细致的计划未能考虑到不可预测的市场波动。


The excessive focus on logic and efficiency led to a neglect of employee morale, illustrating the dangers of hyperrationalities in management.  对逻辑和效率的过度关注导致忽视了员工士气，这说明了管理中过度理性思维方式的危险性。 | 近义词：overrationalization, excessive rationality,  logical extremism | 反义词：irrationality, intuition, emotionality |  词性：名词

词源:

The word "hyperrationalities" is a relatively new term, formed by combining:

* **hyper-:**  A prefix meaning "excessive," "above," or "beyond."
* **rationality:**  The quality of being based on or in accordance with reason or logic.
* **-ities:** A suffix forming plural nouns, indicating multiple instances or qualities.

Therefore, "hyperrationalities" refers to multiple instances or aspects of excessive or overly strict adherence to rationality.  It's a term used primarily in academic and research contexts, particularly in fields like behavioral economics and decision-making theory.
