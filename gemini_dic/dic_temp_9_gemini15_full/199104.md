The word "sikhes" is not a recognized English word.  There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "Sikhs"?

2. **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a proper noun (like a surname or place name) not found in general dictionaries.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word or a slang term not yet widely recognized.

4. **It's from another language:** It might be a word from another language, transliterated incorrectly.

If you can provide more context or clarify the spelling, I can attempt a more accurate analysis.
