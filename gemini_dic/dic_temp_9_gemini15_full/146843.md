词源:
The term "overindexed" is a relatively recent addition to the lexicon, stemming from the combination of "over" (meaning exceeding or surpassing) and "indexed" (referring to the process of assigning a value or weight to something, often relative to a larger whole).  Its widespread use is largely due to its application in data analysis and market research.
