conspansion:/kɒnˈspænʃən/|  n.|  共同扩展，共同扩张|  There is no established word "conspansion" in standard English dictionaries. It seems to be a newly coined word, possibly a blend of "con-" (meaning together or with) and "expansion."  Therefore, a precise definition and usage examples are difficult to provide without further context.  The intended meaning would likely relate to a simultaneous or joint expansion of something. |  例句：This analysis needs a further example sentence.  | 近义词: This analysis needs a further example sentence.  | 反义词: This analysis needs a further example sentence.| 名词
