Etymology:

The word "portico" comes from the Late Latin *porticus, which in turn derives from the Latin word "porticus," meaning a "covered walkway," "porch," or "gallery."  The Latin word itself likely has roots in the Proto-Italic *por-tīkus, possibly related to the verb *portare ("to carry"), suggesting an association with carrying things or providing shelter (as a covered walkway would).  The plural "porticoes" simply adds the standard English plural suffix "-es".
