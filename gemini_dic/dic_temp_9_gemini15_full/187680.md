词源:  The word "rookery" originates from "rook," a type of crow, specifically the Eurasian rook ( *Corvus frugilegus*).  The suffix "-ery" denotes a place or collection of things. Therefore, "rookery" literally means "a place where rooks gather".  Its meaning expanded over time to include other animals that congregate in large groups for breeding or resting.
