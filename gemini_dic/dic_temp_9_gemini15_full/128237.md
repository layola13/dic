neuroglandular: /ˌnʊroʊˈɡlændʒələr/ | adj. | 神经腺的 | Relating to both the nervous system and the glands.  This term describes structures, processes, or functions involving interactions between the nervous system and the endocrine (glandular) system. The nervous system and endocrine system are closely intertwined, with the nervous system often regulating the activity of glands.


英文解析:The word "neuroglandular" is a combination of "neuro-" (relating to nerves or the nervous system) and "-glandular" (relating to glands). It signifies a connection or interaction between the nervous and endocrine systems.  The term is used to describe junctions or relationships where neural signals influence glandular secretions or where glandular hormones affect neural activity.

近义词:neurosocrine (often used interchangeably, though "neurosocrine" might emphasize hormonal aspects more)


反义词:There isn't a direct antonym, as it describes a specific type of interaction.  One could use terms implying separation or independence of nervous and endocrine systems, but it wouldn't be a true antonym.
