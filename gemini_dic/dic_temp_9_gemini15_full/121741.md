词源:

The word "misproposal" is a compound word formed by combining the prefix "mis-" with the noun "proposal."

* **mis-**: This prefix indicates something is wrong, bad, or faulty.  It derives from Old English *mis*, meaning "wrongly," "badly," or "ill."

* **proposal**: This noun means a plan or suggestion, especially a formal one. It comes from the verb "propose," which ultimately traces back to Latin *proponere*, meaning "to put forward," "to offer," or "to suggest."  This Latin word is composed of *pro* ("forward") and *ponere* ("to put").
