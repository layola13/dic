词源:
The word "misfocusses" is formed by adding the prefix "mis-" (meaning wrong or badly) to the verb "focusses" (the present tense third-person singular of "focus").  The root "focus" comes from the Latin word "focus," meaning "hearth" or "fireplace,"  later developing the metaphorical sense of "a point of convergence." The shift in meaning reflects the development of the lens and its ability to bring light to a central point.
