semistiffnesses:/ˈsemiˈstɪfnəsiz/ | n. | 半刚度；半刚性 |  The term "semistiffnesses" refers to the properties of materials or structures that exhibit behavior between fully rigid and completely flexible. It describes a state of partial stiffness, indicating resistance to deformation but not to the same extent as a fully rigid material.  The specific meaning depends heavily on the context (e.g., in structural engineering, geotechnical engineering, or material science).  It's a less common term and often used in specialized technical literature. | The bridge's design incorporates a system of semistiffnesses to absorb seismic shocks. 桥梁的设计结合了一个半刚度系统来吸收地震冲击。 The soil's semistiffnesses affected the foundation's stability. 土壤的半刚性影响了地基的稳定性。 |  partial stiffness, intermediate stiffness |  full rigidity, complete flexibility | n.
