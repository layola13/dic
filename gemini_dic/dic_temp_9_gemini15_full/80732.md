The word "gorsier" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
2. **It's a neologism or slang:**  It might be a newly coined word, a regional dialect word, or slang not yet included in standard dictionaries.
3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name (of a person, place, or thing)  that doesn't follow standard English spelling conventions.
4. **It's from another language:** The word might originate from a different language.  If you can provide context (where you encountered the word), it may be possible to determine its origin and meaning.


To help me provide the analysis you requested, please provide more information, such as:

* **The context in which you saw the word:**  This will help determine its meaning and possible origin.
* **Possible alternative spellings:** If you're unsure of the spelling, list any variations you can think of.


Without this additional information, I cannot fulfill your request.
