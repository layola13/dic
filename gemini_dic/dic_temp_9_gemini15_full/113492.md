lysimeter:/ˈlaɪsɪmiːtər/| n. |蒸渗仪，蒸渗计 |A lysimeter is an instrument used to measure the amount of water that evaporates from and transpires through a plant or soil.  It is typically a container of soil or a section of land that is isolated and weighed regularly to determine water loss. | Example: Researchers used a lysimeter to study the evapotranspiration rates of different plant species.  研究人员用蒸渗仪研究不同植物物种的蒸散速率。|近义词：evaporation meter, evapotranspiration gauge |反义词：None.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The lysimeter measures water loss accurately. = 蒸渗仪精确地测量水分流失。
Scientists use lysimeters in various experiments. = 科学家在各种实验中使用蒸渗仪。


一般过去时:
The lysimeter showed significant water loss yesterday. = 蒸渗仪昨天显示出大量水分流失。
Researchers weighed the lysimeter daily during the experiment. = 研究人员在实验期间每天称量蒸渗仪。


现在完成时:
The scientists have used this lysimeter for many years. = 科学家们已经使用了这个蒸渗仪多年了。
They have collected a lot of data using the lysimeter. = 他们利用蒸渗仪收集了大量数据。


过去完成时:
The experiment had already begun before they installed the lysimeter. = 在他们安装蒸渗仪之前，实验已经开始了。
The team had calibrated the lysimeter carefully before starting. = 团队在开始之前仔细校准了蒸渗仪。


将来时:
We will use a new lysimeter for the next experiment. = 我们将在下一次实验中使用新的蒸渗仪。
The researchers will analyze the data from the lysimeter next week. = 研究人员将在下周分析蒸渗仪的数据。


虚拟语气:
If we had a larger lysimeter, we could study a wider area. = 如果我们有一个更大的蒸渗仪，我们可以研究更广阔的区域。
It would be helpful if the lysimeter was more precise. = 如果蒸渗仪更精确一些就好了。


被动语态:
The lysimeter is regularly monitored by the researchers. = 蒸渗仪定期由研究人员监测。
The data from the lysimeter are being analyzed. = 蒸渗仪的数据正在被分析。


疑问句:
What type of lysimeter is best for this experiment? = 对于这个实验，哪种类型的蒸渗仪最好？
How often is the lysimeter weighed? = 蒸渗仪多久称重一次？


否定句:
The lysimeter did not show any significant water loss. = 蒸渗仪没有显示任何明显的水分流失。
We did not have enough time to calibrate the lysimeter properly. = 我们没有足够的时间来正确校准蒸渗仪。
