microseismograph:/ˈmaɪkroʊˈsaɪzməɡræf/ | n. | 微震仪 | A microseismograph is a sensitive instrument used to detect and record extremely small ground movements, often those caused by seismic waves too small to be felt by humans.  These instruments are crucial for monitoring subtle seismic activity, such as those associated with volcanic eruptions, microearthquakes, or even ocean waves. | The microseismograph detected a series of tiny tremors preceding the volcanic eruption. 微震仪在火山爆发前探测到一系列轻微的震动。  Scientists use microseismographs to study the Earth's crust and detect subtle changes in seismic activity. 科学家使用微震仪来研究地壳并检测地震活动的细微变化。| seismometer, seismograph |  (None readily available as an antonym; the opposite would be a device that doesn't detect microseisms, which isn't a specific instrument.) | noun
