inheritability: /ˌɪnˌhɛrɪtəˈbɪləti/ | n. |遗传性，可遗传性 | The extent to which a characteristic is determined by genetic factors and hence passed from parent to offspring.  It refers to the proportion of variation in a trait within a population that is due to genetic variation.  | Example: The inheritability of intelligence is a complex and much-debated topic. 遗传智力的程度是一个复杂且备受争议的话题。

The high inheritability of eye color is well-established.  眼睛颜色的高遗传性是公认的。|近义词：heredity, transmissibility |反义词：environmental influence, acquired characteristic


USAGE->

疑问句:
What is the inheritability of this particular gene? = 这个特定基因的遗传性是多少？
How is the inheritability of complex traits measured? = 如何测量复杂性状的遗传性？


否定句:
The inheritability is not solely determined by genetics. = 遗传性并非完全由基因决定。
This trait does not show high inheritability. = 这种性状没有表现出高遗传性。
