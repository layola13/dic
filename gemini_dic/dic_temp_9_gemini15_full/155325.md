词源:
The word "pharisaism" derives from the  Pharisees, a prominent Jewish sect in the time of Jesus.  They adhered strictly to the Law of Moses, but were accused by Jesus and others of hypocrisy and self-righteousness.  This negative portrayal led to the term "pharisaism" being used to describe hypocritical piety and outward religious observance without inner sincerity.
