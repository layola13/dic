词源:
The word "courageously" is derived from the Old French word "corageusement," which itself comes from the Latin word "cor," meaning "heart."  The suffix "-ously" indicates an adverbial form, meaning "in a courageous manner."  The evolution reflects the historical understanding of courage as stemming from one's heart and spirit.
