词源:
The word "distract" comes from the Latin word "distrahere," which means "to draw apart" or "to pull in different directions."  The prefix "dis-" means "apart" or "away," and the root "-trahere" means "to draw" or "to pull."  Therefore, the original meaning of "distract" implied pulling something away from its focus or course.
