词源:
The word "encrisped" is derived from the verb "crisp," meaning to make or become brittle and crisp, and the prefix "en-," which intensifies the meaning.  The ultimate origin lies in the Middle English word "crispe,"  itself coming from the Old French "crispe" and ultimately from the Latin "crispus," meaning "curly, wavy."
