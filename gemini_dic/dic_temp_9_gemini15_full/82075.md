词源:
The word "grizelin" ultimately derives from the Old French word *gris, meaning "grey."  The addition of "-elin" is a diminutive suffix, suggesting a smaller or less intense version of grey, resulting in the greyish-brown or greyish-white meaning.  The association with horses' coats is likely why the word persists, as this specific shade is often seen in their coloring.
