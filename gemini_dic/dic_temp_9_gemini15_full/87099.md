词源:
The word "herald" comes from the Old French word "heralt," which ultimately derives from the Germanic word for "army" or "warrior."  Originally, heralds were messengers and officials in medieval courts who made proclamations and announcements, often involving warfare or tournaments.  Their role evolved, but the connection to announcing important events remains central to the word's meaning.
