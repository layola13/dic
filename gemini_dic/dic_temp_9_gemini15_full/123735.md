词源:
The word "moonshine" in the context of illicit liquor production emerged in the 19th century.  Its origin lies in the clandestine nature of the activity.  The distilling process often took place at night, under the light of the moon, hence the name.  The word's earlier meanings related to nonsense or foolishness, but the association with illegal alcohol production became predominant.
