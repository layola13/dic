The word "nonendings" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word or expression.  Therefore, a full etymological breakdown and standard grammatical analysis are impossible.  However, we can analyze its potential meaning and structure:


/nɑːnˈɛndɪŋz/ | n. | 非结尾；非终结 |  The word is formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") with "endings," suggesting something that lacks endings or is not conclusive.  It could refer to:


* **Open-ended structures or processes:**  Things that continue indefinitely without a clear conclusion.  For example, an ongoing conversation might be described as having "nonendings" if it's constantly evolving without a definitive end point.


* **Literary or artistic techniques:**  In creative writing or art, it could refer to a style that avoids closure or resolution, leaving the audience with ambiguity or unanswered questions.


* **Abstract concepts:** It might describe a philosophical idea of continuous change or the absence of finality.


**Example (Illustrative, as the word is not standard):**

"The film's nonendings left the audience pondering its multiple interpretations." = 这部电影的开放式结局让观众不断思考它的多种解读。


**Near Synonyms (depending on context):**

* Open-endedness
* Inconclusiveness
* Ambiguity
* Ongoingness
* Perpetualness


**Antonyms (depending on context):**

* Conclusions
* Resolutions
* Finality
* Definitiveness
* Closure


**USAGE:** Because "nonendings" is not a recognized word, providing grammatical examples in various tenses is not possible.  The word would need to be used in the context of a specific sentence, and the usage would depend on the intended meaning.

**PHRASE:** There are no established phrases using "nonendings."  The word itself would constitute a phrase when used in a sentence.


**Note:**  The lack of a standard dictionary entry prevents a complete analysis.  If the word was used in a specific text, providing the context would allow for a more accurate interpretation.
