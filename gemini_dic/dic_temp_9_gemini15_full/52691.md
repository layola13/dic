词源:
dignitary derives from the late Middle English word "dignitarie,"  ultimately from the Latin "dignitas," meaning "worthiness," "rank," or "importance."  The suffix "-ary" indicates a person associated with a particular quality or thing.  Thus, a dignitary is a person of high worth, rank, or importance.
