词源:
The word "ensuring" comes from the verb "ensure," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "enseurer," meaning "to make sure" or "to secure."  The prefix "en-" is of Germanic origin, intensifying the meaning.  The suffix "-ure" is a common noun-forming suffix in English, derived from Old French.
