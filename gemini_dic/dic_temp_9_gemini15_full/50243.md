词源:
The word "dependence" comes from the Old French word "dependence," which itself derives from the Latin word "dependentia," meaning "hanging down from" or "something that hangs down."  The Latin root is "pendere," meaning "to hang," "to weigh," or "to be suspended."  The prefix "de-" in "dependentia" indicates "from" or "away from," implying a state of being reliant on something else.  The English word evolved through a gradual shift in meaning, from the literal sense of something hanging down to the figurative meaning of reliance or being controlled by something else.
