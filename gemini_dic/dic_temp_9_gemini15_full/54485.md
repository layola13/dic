词源:
dis- (否定前缀) + inter (between) + ment (名词后缀)  The word ultimately derives from the Latin word "inter" (between, among) and implies the action of placing something "between" or "among" other things (in the ground).  The prefix "dis-" reverses this action, indicating the removal or taking out from between.
