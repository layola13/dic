The word "relade" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Perhaps you could provide more context where you encountered this word.

2. **It's a neologism or slang:**  Newly coined words or slang terms aren't always found in dictionaries.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **It's from a specific field or language:** It might be a technical term, a word from another language, or a proper noun.


Without more information, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical explanations as requested in the format.  Please provide the context in which you saw "relade," and I'll do my best to help.
