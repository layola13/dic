diphycercal:/ˌdaɪfɪˈsɜːrkl/| adj.| 双尾形的；两侧对称的 | Having a tail that is symmetrical and pointed at the end, as opposed to heterocercal or homocercal.  This term is primarily used in zoology, specifically in describing the tails of fishes. | Example: The fossil fish showed a diphycercal tail, indicating a possible evolutionary link to more primitive forms.  | 近义词：symmetrical (in the context of tail structure) | 反义词：heterocercal, homocercal


Etymology:

The word "diphycercal" is derived from Greek:

* **di- (δι-)**:  meaning "two," "twice," or "double."
* **phy- (φυ-)**:  relating to "growth" or "nature."  This is related to the root found in words like "phylogeny" (evolutionary history).
* **cerc- (κερκ-)**: meaning "tail."  This root is also seen in words like "cercal" (referring to the tail).
* **-al**:  an adjectival suffix.


Therefore, diphycercal literally translates to "having a two-part, symmetrical tail."


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a descriptive manner within the context of zoology and paleontology.  It does not have a verb form or conjugate through tenses in the same way as common verbs.  It is always used as an adjective.  Therefore, tense conjugation examples are not applicable.


Example sentences illustrating its usage:

* **Descriptive:**  "The larval stage of the fish exhibits a diphycercal tail, which later transforms into a heterocercal tail." (幼鱼阶段的鱼具有双尾形的尾巴，后来变成歪尾形的尾巴。)

* **Comparative:** "Unlike the homocercal tail of most modern bony fishes, the extinct coelacanth possessed a diphycercal tail." (与大多数现代硬骨鱼的正尾不同，已灭绝的腔棘鱼具有双尾形的尾巴。)

* **Scientific writing:** "Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the diphycercal tail is a plesiomorphic character in this lineage." (系统发育分析表明，双尾形的尾巴是这个谱系中的祖征。)


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases that specifically use "diphycercal."  Its use is limited to scientific and academic contexts.
