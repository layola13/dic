词源:  From Middle English *ecstasie, from Old French extase, from Late Latin extasis, from Greek ἔκστασις (éktasis), from ἐκ- (ek-) "out" + στῆναι (stênai) "to stand".  The original Greek meaning referred to a state of being "out of one's senses," often in a religious context.  The modern meaning evolved from this, focusing on the overwhelming feeling of joy and happiness.
