词源:

The word "effeteness" is derived from the adjective "effete," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "effētus," meaning "worn out," "exhausted," or "barren."  The Latin word is the past participle of the verb "effēri," meaning "to bear offspring," but its usage shifted to emphasize the state of being spent or depleted after bearing offspring, eventually leading to the current meaning of weakness and decadence.
