The word "{inous}" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure field.  If you could provide more context where you encountered this word, it might be possible to offer a more helpful response.
