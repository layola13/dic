词源:
The adverb "romantically" derives from the adjective "romantic," which ultimately traces back to the French word "romantique,"  itself stemming from the Romance languages and ultimately related to the concept of "romance," referring to medieval tales of chivalry and love.  The evolution reflects the shift in the meaning of "romantic" from its original association with medieval romances to its modern connotation of idealized love and passion.
