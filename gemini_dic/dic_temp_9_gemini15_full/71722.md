词源:  The word "flawed" comes from the Old English word *flēon*, meaning "to flee" or "to avoid."  Over time, the meaning shifted to suggest something that was "escaped" or "missed" in the process of creation, resulting in an imperfection.  The modern sense of "flawed" developed from the noun "flaw," which itself has roots in the Middle English word "flawe," likely derived from Old Norse or Old French.
