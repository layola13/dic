The word "moia" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of another word.  More context is needed to determine what word it might be intended to represent.
* **A proper noun:** It might be a proper noun (a name of a person, place, or thing) specific to a particular context or language.
* **A word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language, requiring translation from that language.
* **Neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word or slang term not yet widely recognized.


To provide the requested analysis, please provide more context where you encountered this word.  For example:

* **The sentence or phrase where it appears.**
* **The source of the word (book, website, conversation, etc.).**
* **Any clues about its meaning or origin.**


With more information, I can attempt a more accurate analysis.
