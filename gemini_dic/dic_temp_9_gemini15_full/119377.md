microcracking:/ˈmaɪkroʊˌkrækɪŋ/| n.|微裂;微裂纹|The formation of many small cracks in a material, often too small to be seen with the naked eye but detectable by other means such as ultrasonic testing.  These cracks can significantly weaken the material and reduce its overall strength and durability.  |例句：The concrete showed signs of microcracking after the earthquake. 地震后混凝土出现了微裂的迹象。
The excessive heat caused microcracking in the ceramic tiles. 过高的温度导致瓷砖出现微裂纹。|近义词：fissuring, cracking (in a small scale)|反义词：integrity, soundness|名词
