词源：
This word is a neologism,  formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to "etherealnesses," which itself is the plural form of "ethereality" (a state of being ethereal).  "Ethereal" derives from the Middle English "etherial," ultimately from Late Latin *aetherius, from Greek αἰθήρ (aithēr), meaning "upper air," "clear sky," or "heaven."  Therefore, "nonetherealnesses" refers to the absence or opposite of qualities associated with lightness, delicacy, and immateriality.
