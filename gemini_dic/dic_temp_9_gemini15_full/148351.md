PHRASE->

There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "overspeculates."  The word itself is used in a more formal and analytical context.  However, phrases incorporating similar concepts include:

Wild guess = 疯狂猜测

Reading too much into = 过度解读
Making assumptions = 作出假设
Baseless speculation = 无根据的推测

词源:

The word "overspeculates" is formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the verb "speculates."  "Speculate" comes from the Late Latin word "speculatus," the past participle of "speculare," meaning "to observe, watch, look at." This ultimately derives from the Latin "specere," meaning "to look" or "to see."  Therefore, "overspeculates" means to look or observe excessively, leading to unwarranted conclusions.
