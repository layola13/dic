词源:

The term "nonarchitecture" is a relatively recent coinage, emerging in the late 20th century within discussions of postmodern and avant-garde architecture. It's a straightforward combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and "architecture."  The prefix indicates a negation or opposition to the established norms and practices of traditional architecture.  Its precise meaning and application have evolved within architectural discourse, reflecting ongoing debates about the nature and purpose of built environments.
