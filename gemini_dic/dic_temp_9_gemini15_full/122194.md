词源:
The word "misunderstood" is formed by the prefix "mis-" (meaning wrongly or badly) + "understood" (the past participle of the verb "understand").  The root of "understand" traces back to Old English *understandan,  from *under- + *standan ("to stand"). The sense evolved from "to stand by, support" to "to comprehend." Therefore, "misunderstood" literally means "wrongly or badly comprehended."
