词源:

The word "garrulous" originates from the Late Latin word *garrulus*, meaning "chattering," "babbling," or "talkative."  This, in turn, is derived from the Latin verb *garrire*, meaning "to chatter" or "to clack."  The connection is clear: the root suggests the sound of noisy, continuous talk.


用法说明:

Garrulous is primarily used as an adjective to describe a person who talks excessively, often about unimportant things.  While it implies talkativeness, it carries a slightly negative connotation, suggesting that the talk is rambling, excessive, and perhaps even tiresome to listeners.  It's not simply being sociable; it's being overly talkative to the point of being annoying.  The emphasis is on the excessive and often pointless nature of the speech.
