词源:
The word "overdiversifies" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "diversifies" (from "diversify," meaning "to make or become more diverse").  "Diversify" itself comes from the Late Latin word "diversificare," which is composed of "diversus" (diverse, different) and "facere" (to make).  Therefore, "overdiversifies" literally means "to make excessively diverse."
