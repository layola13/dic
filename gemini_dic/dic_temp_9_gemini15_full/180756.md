regularization:/ˌreɡjʊləraɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 正则化；规范化 | The process of adding penalty to a loss function to prevent overfitting in machine learning.  It discourages overly complex models by penalizing large weights.  Regularization techniques include L1 and L2 regularization (also known as Lasso and Ridge regression respectively).| 例句：Regularization helps to improve the generalization ability of a model.  正则化有助于提高模型的泛化能力。 | 例句：The use of regularization reduced overfitting and improved the model's performance on unseen data. 使用正则化减少了过拟合并提高了模型对未见数据的性能。| 近义词：regularization, normalization, standardization | 反义词：overfitting


USAGE->

PHRASE->
L1 regularization:  L1正则化
L2 regularization:  L2正则化
Regularization parameter: 正则化参数
Ridge regression:岭回归 (a type of L2 regularization)
Lasso regression: 套索回归 (a type of L1 regularization)

WORD ORIGIN->
The word "regularization" is derived from the verb "regularize," which means to make something regular or conform to a rule.  The suffix "-ation" indicates the process or action of regularizing.  The root word "regular" originates from the Latin word "regularis," meaning "according to rule."
