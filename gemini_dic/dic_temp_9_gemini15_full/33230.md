词源:

The word "chronographer" is derived from two Greek words:

* **chrono-**:  From the Greek word "chronos," meaning "time."
* **-grapher**: From the Greek word "graphein," meaning "to write" or "to record."

Therefore, a chronographer literally means a "time recorder" or "time writer."  This accurately reflects its function of measuring and recording elapsed time.
