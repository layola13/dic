/ˌoʊvərˈbriːft/ | adj. | 过度简报的；信息不足的 |  The word "overbriefed" is not a standard English word. It's a newly coined word, likely formed by analogy with words like "underbriefed". It implies that someone has been given insufficient information or briefing, leading to a lack of understanding or preparation.  This is the opposite of being "overbriefed," which would suggest giving too much information. There is no standard dictionary definition.  |  The team felt overbriefed before the crucial presentation, leading to a shaky performance.  团队在关键演示之前感到信息不足，导致表现不稳定。 | underinformed, unprepared | well-informed, well-prepared | adj.
