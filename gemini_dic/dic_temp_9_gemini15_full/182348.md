词源:
The word "encounter" comes from the Old French word "encontre," which means "meeting," "meeting place," or "encounter."  The Old French word itself derives from the Latin phrase "in contra," meaning "against" or "opposite."  This highlights the original sense of a meeting, often implying some degree of opposition or conflict, although this is not always the case in modern usage.
