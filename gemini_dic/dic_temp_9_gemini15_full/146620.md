overhandicapped:/ˌoʊvərˈhændikæpt/| adj.|过度残疾的，残疾程度过高的|  This word describes a situation where someone is considered to have a disability level exceeding what is typically understood or accounted for. It suggests an excessive or overwhelming degree of handicap.  This term is rarely used and can be considered insensitive.
