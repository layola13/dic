词源:  The word "deputy" comes from the Old French word "depute," meaning "appointed," "delegated," or "entrusted." This Old French word, in turn, is derived from the Latin word "deputare," meaning "to reckon," "to compute," or "to assign." The sense of "appointing" or "delegating" evolved from the original meaning of assigning or allocating a task or responsibility to someone.
