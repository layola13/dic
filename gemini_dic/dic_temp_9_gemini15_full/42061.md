cotectic:/ˌkoʊˈtɛktɪk/| adj.|共晶的，共熔的| Relating to or denoting a mixture of substances that melts and solidifies at a single temperature, and that has a composition different from either of its components.  It refers to a specific point on a phase diagram where two or more solid phases melt to form a liquid phase at a constant temperature. |The cotectic point in the binary phase diagram represents the eutectic composition.|共晶点在二元相图上代表共晶成分。|近义词：eutectic (often used interchangeably)|反义词：N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The cotectic point is crucial for understanding alloy behavior. = 共晶点对于理解合金行为至关重要。
This mixture exhibits cotectic properties. = 这种混合物表现出共晶特性。


一般过去时:
Scientists studied the cotectic reaction in detail. = 科学家们详细研究了共晶反应。
The experiment demonstrated the cotectic point of the alloy. = 实验演示了该合金的共晶点。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several cotectic systems. = 研究人员已经确定了几种共晶系统。
We have observed the cotectic temperature in this material. = 我们已经观察到这种材料的共晶温度。


过去完成时:
They had already determined the cotectic composition before the experiment. = 他们在实验之前就已经确定了共晶成分。
The analysis had revealed the presence of a cotectic structure. = 分析已经揭示了共晶结构的存在。


将来时:
They will analyze the cotectic behavior of the new material. = 他们将分析这种新材料的共晶行为。
We will determine the exact cotectic point using advanced techniques. = 我们将使用先进的技术确定精确的共晶点。


虚拟语气:
If the composition were exactly cotectic, the melting would occur at a single temperature. = 如果成分完全是共晶的，则熔化将发生在单一温度下。
It would be helpful if we had a better understanding of cotectic systems. = 如果我们对共晶系统有更好的理解，那将会有所帮助。


被动语态:

The phase diagram was carefully analyzed to find the cotectic point. = 仔细分析了相图以找到共晶点。


疑问句:
Is this alloy a cotectic mixture? = 这种合金是共晶混合物吗？
What is the cotectic temperature of this substance? = 这种物质的共晶温度是多少？


否定句:
This mixture is not a cotectic composition. = 这种混合物不是共晶成分。
The material did not show a distinct cotectic point. = 该材料没有显示出明显的共晶点。
