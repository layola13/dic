词源:
The word "non-renewable" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "renewable" (capable of being renewed or replaced naturally).  "Renewable" itself comes from the verb "renew," ultimately from Old French *renouveller, from re- "again" + *nouveler, from *nouvel "new."
