词源:
From "chiffon," a French word meaning "rag" or "shred," ultimately derived from the Old French word "chifre" meaning "rag" or "tatter."  The word "chiffon" entered the English language in the 19th century to describe the lightweight, gauzy fabric.  The adjectival form "chiffony" followed naturally.
