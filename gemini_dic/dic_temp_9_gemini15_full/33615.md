词源:

The name "Cincinnati" is derived from the Society of the Cincinnati, a hereditary organization of officers of the Continental Army formed after the American Revolutionary War.  The society was named after Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus, a Roman general known for his civic virtue and his willingness to return to his farm after achieving military success.  因此，“辛辛那提”这个名字源于辛辛那提协会，这是一个在独立战争结束后由大陆军军官组成的世袭组织。该协会以卢修斯·昆克图斯·辛西纳图斯命名，他是一位罗马将军，以其公民美德和在取得军事成功后愿意回到农场而闻名。
