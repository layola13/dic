词源:  The word "motey" likely derives from the Middle English word "mote," meaning "spot" or "speck," referring to the small spots or flecks of color that create a variegated or multicolored effect.  The "-y" suffix adds an adjectival quality, indicating the presence of many such spots or a generally speckled appearance.
