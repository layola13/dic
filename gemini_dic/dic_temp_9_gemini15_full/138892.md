nutation:/nuˈteɪʃən/| n. |章动；摆动；颤动 |The slight wobbling motion of a spinning body, such as the Earth's axis.  This oscillation causes a small periodic variation in the Earth's precession.  |例句：The Earth's nutation causes slight variations in the position of the celestial pole.|近义词：oscillation, wobble, vibration |反义词：stability, stillness


USAGE->
