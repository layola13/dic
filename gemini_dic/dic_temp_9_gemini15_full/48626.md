This word is extremely rare and not commonly used in modern English.  It's a plural form of "defencelessness," which itself is less common than "defenselessness."  The word is formed by adding the plural "-es" to the noun "defencelessness."


**Word Formation:**

* **defenceless:**  (adjective)  lacking the ability to defend oneself.  This is formed from "defence" (or "defense" in American English) + "-less" (suffix indicating lack of).
* **defencelessness:** (noun) the state or quality of being defenceless.  This is formed by adding the "-ness" suffix to the adjective "defenceless," creating a noun.
* **defencelessnesses:** (noun, plural) multiple instances or states of defencelessness.


**Usage Notes:**

Because "defencelessnesses" is a very uncommon word, there are no readily available examples of its usage in common texts or corpora.  The best way to understand its meaning is through its component parts: multiple instances of a lack of defense.

**Examples (constructed, as natural usage is extremely rare):**
