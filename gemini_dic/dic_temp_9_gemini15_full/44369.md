cross-correlation:/ˌkrɒsˌkɒrəˈleɪʃən/| n. |互相关;交叉相关|Cross-correlation is a measure of similarity between two waveforms as a function of a time-lag applied to one of them.  It is used to find repeating patterns, or motifs, within a single signal or between two different signals.  It's a mathematical process that reveals how similar two signals are at different time offsets. For example, it can be used to detect the presence of a known signal within a noisy background. |Example: The cross-correlation function revealed a strong similarity between the two seismic signals, indicating a potential link between the earthquakes.  交叉相关函数揭示了两个地震信号之间的高度相似性，表明地震之间可能存在联系。|近义词：correlation, similarity, correspondence|反义词：lack of correlation, dissimilarity


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't conjugate like a verb.  It does not have tenses, aspects or moods as verbs do.  Therefore, typical verb conjugations are not applicable.  It can be used in various grammatical structures, however.


Example in a simple sentence:
The researchers analyzed the cross-correlation between the EEG and fMRI data. 研究人员分析了脑电图和功能磁共振成像数据之间的互相关性。


Example in a more complex sentence:
A high value of cross-correlation between the two audio signals confirmed the presence of the echo.  两个音频信号之间的高互相关值证实了回声的存在。


Example using prepositions:
The study focused on the cross-correlation of the signals with respect to time. 这项研究侧重于信号相对于时间的互相关性。

The results showed a low cross-correlation despite the similar waveforms.  尽管波形相似，但结果显示互相关性较低。


PHRASE->
cross-correlation function: 互相关函数
cross-correlation analysis: 互相关分析
cross-correlation coefficient: 互相关系数
cross-correlation matrix: 互相关矩阵
time-lag cross-correlation: 时滞互相关
