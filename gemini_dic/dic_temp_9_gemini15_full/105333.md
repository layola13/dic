词源:

The phrase combines "kick" (to strike forcefully) and "butt" (informal term for the buttocks).  The meaning evolved to express something powerful and effective, implying a forceful and impactful positive effect, rather than literal kicking.  Its origin is likely rooted in American slang and popular culture.
