The word "datsu" is not an English word.  It appears to be a transliteration of a word from another language, most likely Japanese.  Therefore, a full English-language analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a response, I need the original language of the word and its meaning in that language.  Then I can provide a translation, phonetic transcription, and potential English equivalents.
