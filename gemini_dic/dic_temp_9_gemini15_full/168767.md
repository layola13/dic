词源:
From Middle French *prodigence, from Latin *prodigent- (stem of prodigens), present participle of prodigī, "to squander, lavish," from prodigi, "to squander."  The ultimate root is likely Proto-Indo-European *pro- ("forth") + *deg- ("to lead, to do").  The sense development reflects the idea of something being "led forth" or expended wastefully.
