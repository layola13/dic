odometry:/oʊˈdɑːmətri/|/əˈdɒmɪtri/| n. |里程计法；里程测量；计程仪测量|The process of estimating the position and orientation of a mobile robot by using data from its movement sensors.  Odometry is often used in robotics and autonomous navigation systems to track the robot's location without relying on external references like GPS. |Example:  The robot's odometry system provided an estimate of its position, but it was subject to drift over time.  机器人里程计系统提供了其位置的估计，但它会随着时间推移而漂移。

|近义词：position estimation, path integration, travel measurement |反义词：N/A|
