electrine:/ɪˈlɛktrɪn/| n. |电子，电子流|A hypothetical particle, sometimes proposed in early theories of electricity, similar to an electron but with different properties.  The term is largely obsolete in modern physics.|例句：The old textbooks mentioned an electrine, a hypothetical particle carrying a unit of electrical charge.|近义词：electron (though not a perfect synonym, as electrine is obsolete)|反义词：N/A


USAGE->
