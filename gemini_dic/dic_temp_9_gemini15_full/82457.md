WORD ORIGIN->

The word "grumousness" derives from the adjective "grumpy," which itself has uncertain origins.  Some etymologists suggest a possible connection to the Old English word "grum," meaning "to growl" or "to grumble."  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being grumpy.  Therefore, "grumousness" essentially means "the state of being grumpy."
