confinedness's:/kənˈfaɪndɪdnəsɪz/| n. |局限性；有限性；禁闭状态|The word "confinedness's" is not a standard English word.  It seems to be an attempt to form the possessive of "confinedness," which itself is a noun referring to the state of being confined or restricted.  The correct possessive form is simply "confinedness's."  However, using the possessive form is often awkward with this word. It's more natural to rephrase the sentence. | The confinedness of the small room was oppressive.  这间小屋的局促压抑。The feeling of confinedness increased as the day wore on.  随着时间的推移，局促感越来越强。|limitation, restriction, constraint|freedom, openness, spaciousness|名词
