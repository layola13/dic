/kənˈflʌksɪbɪləti/ | n. | 汇合性；融合性；可融合性 |  The word "confluxibility" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word.  Based on its construction, it seems to combine "conflux" (meaning a flowing together of streams or a merging of things) and "-ibility" (a suffix indicating capacity or capability). Therefore, a possible definition would be the capacity or capability of things to merge, blend, or flow together.  However, without established usage, its meaning and applications remain uncertain. |  There are no standard examples because the word is not in common use.  A possible example (using the inferred meaning) would be: *The confluxibility of the two cultures was evident in their shared artistic traditions.*  (The ability of the two cultures to merge was clear in their shared art.) |  近义词:  mergeability, fusibility, integrability, compatibility | 反义词:  incompatibility, separability,  irreconcilability | noun
