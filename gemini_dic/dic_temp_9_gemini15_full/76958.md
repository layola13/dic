词源:
The word "garbage" ultimately derives from the Old French word "garber," meaning "to sift," "to sort," or "to glean."  This refers to the process of separating edible parts from waste.  Over time, the meaning shifted to refer to the waste itself.  The word evolved through Middle English forms before reaching its modern usage.
