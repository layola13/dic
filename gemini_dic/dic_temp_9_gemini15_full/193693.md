词源:
The word "self-complacencies" is derived from the adjective "self-complacent," which is a combination of "self" and "complacent."  "Self" is a straightforward English word meaning oneself. "Complacent" comes from the Old French "complaisant," meaning "pleasing," ultimately rooted in the Latin "complacēre," meaning "to please."  The "-cies" suffix indicates a plural noun form, referring to multiple instances of self-complacency.
