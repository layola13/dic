词源:
The word "incommoded" comes from the Old French word "incommoder," which itself is derived from the Latin words "in-" (meaning "in" or "into") and "commodus" (meaning "convenient" or "suitable").  The prefix "in-" in this context indicates a negative or opposite meaning, thus "incommodus" essentially means "inconvenient."  The word evolved through Middle English before arriving at its modern form.
