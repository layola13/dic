词源:The word is a compound of "eye" and "wash," referring to the act of washing the eyes.  The figurative meaning developed from the idea of something superficially cleansing but ultimately ineffective. The figurative use likely emerged in the 19th century.  The "wash" part is connected to the verb "to wash," meaning to cleanse or purify, but in this context it implies a superficial or inadequate cleansing.
