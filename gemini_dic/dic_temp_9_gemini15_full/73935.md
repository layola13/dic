The word "forter" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a detailed analysis following your requested format.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:** Perhaps you meant a different word?  Could you double-check the spelling or provide more context where you encountered this word?
* **A neologism or technical term:**  It might be a newly coined word or a term specific to a particular field. If so, please provide context.
* **A word from a dialect or archaic English:** It might be a word used in a specific region or a historical form of English.  Again, more context would be needed.
