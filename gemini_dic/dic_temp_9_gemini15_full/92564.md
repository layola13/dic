词源:
From "hysteria" + "-genic".  "Hysteria" originates from the Greek word "ὑστέρα" (hystera), meaning "womb," reflecting the historical (and erroneous) belief that hysteria was a female-specific disorder caused by problems with the uterus. "-genic" is a combining form meaning "producing" or "causing."
