词源:
The word "outgambles" is a combination of the prefix "out-" (meaning to surpass or exceed) and the verb "gambles" (participating in games of chance).  It's a relatively recent formation, arising from the common use of the "out-" prefix to create verbs expressing superiority in competitive activities.
