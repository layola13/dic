词源：The word "groundswell" originates from the nautical term "swell," referring to a long, rolling wave on the ocean's surface.  The "ground" prefix adds the connotation of a deep, underlying movement or force, originating from the base or foundation.  Therefore, a "groundswell" suggests a powerful, widespread movement that starts from the base of a population or society.
