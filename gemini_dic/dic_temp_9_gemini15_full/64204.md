equidifferent:/ˌiːkwɪˈdɪfərənt/| adj.|等差的，等距的|Having a constant difference between consecutive terms in a sequence.|The numbers 2, 5, 8, 11 form an equidifferent series because the difference between consecutive terms is always 3.|近义词：arithmetical, equidistant|反义词：unequidistant


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in mathematical contexts, so tense variations are less relevant.  The focus is on describing a relationship between numbers or terms.

Example sentences illustrating the use of "equidifferent" in different contexts:

Simple declarative sentence:
The sequence is equidifferent. = 这个数列是等差数列。


Sentence with a relative clause:
The points plotted on the graph represent an equidifferent series, which is readily apparent from their spacing. = 图表上绘制的点代表一个等差数列，从它们的间距可以很容易地看出这一点。


Sentence with a prepositional phrase:
In an equidifferent progression, the common difference is crucial. = 在等差数列中，公差至关重要。

Sentence emphasizing the constant difference:
An equidifferent sequence has a constant difference between successive elements. = 等差数列的相邻元素之间存在一个常数差。


Sentence in a comparative context:
Unlike the geometric series, the equidifferent series shows a constant additive difference. = 与等比数列不同，等差数列显示出恒定的加法差。


Sentence where the concept is negated:
The data points are not equidifferent; the intervals are irregular. = 数据点不是等差的；区间是不规则的。


PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases directly using "equidifferent." The word itself is fairly specific to mathematical contexts.  Instead, related phrases would use terms like "arithmetic progression," "common difference," or "constant difference."

Examples of related phrases:

Arithmetic progression:  An arithmetic progression is an equidifferent sequence. = 等差数列是一个等差数列。(Illustrative, showing the relationship, not a phrase with "equidifferent")

Common difference: The common difference in the arithmetic progression is 5. = 等差数列中的公差是5。(Illustrates a concept related to equidifferent sequences.)

Constant difference: The sequence demonstrates a constant difference between consecutive terms. = 数列显示出连续项之间的恒定差。(Illustrates a key characteristic of equidifferent sequences.)

Equidistant points: Equidistant points on a line form an equidifferent sequence of their positions. = 直线上等距的点构成它们位置的等差数列。(Shows a geometric interpretation related to the mathematical concept.)

Arithmetic mean: The arithmetic mean of the equidifferent sequence is easily calculated. = 等差数列的算术平均值很容易计算。(Illustrates a calculation frequently performed on equidifferent sequences.)
