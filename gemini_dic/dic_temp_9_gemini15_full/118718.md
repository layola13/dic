metafictionists: /ˌmɛtəfɪkʃənɪsts/ | n. | 元小说家 | Writers of metafiction.  They are authors who self-consciously and explicitly draw attention to the artificiality of their narratives. Their works often blur the lines between fiction and reality, and comment on the process of writing itself. | Example: Many postmodern metafictionists employ techniques like unreliable narrators and self-reflexive narratives. 许多后现代元小说家采用不可靠的叙述者和自我反思的叙事手法。 | 近义词: self-reflexive novelists, experimental writers | 反义词: realist writers (反义词较为宽泛，因为元小说家并不一定和现实主义作家完全对立)
