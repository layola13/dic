The word "deutches" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a misspelling or a word from another language.  It's likely a misspelling of "Deutsch," the German word for "German."  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis according to your requested format.  To provide the analysis, I need a valid English word.
