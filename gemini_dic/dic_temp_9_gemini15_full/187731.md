rootcap:/ˈruːtkæp/| n.|根冠|The rootcap is a protective layer of cells covering the tip of a plant root.  It protects the delicate meristematic tissue (the region of active cell division) from damage as the root pushes through the soil. The rootcap also secretes mucilage, a slimy substance that lubricates the root's passage through the soil and helps with water and nutrient uptake.|例句：The rootcap protects the apical meristem from abrasion as the root grows through the soil. 根冠保护根尖分生组织在根穿过土壤时免受磨损。|The rootcap also helps the plant to sense gravity and moisture.  根冠还有助于植物感知重力和湿度。|近义词：root tip, root apex|反义词：None
