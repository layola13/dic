词源:
The word "reliquiae" is the plural form of the Latin word "reliquia," meaning "something left behind," "remains," or "remnant."  It entered English through the Medieval Latin use of the term to describe the remains of saints and other holy figures.  This religious association is reflected in its continued use.
