The word "itza" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical attributes, translation, analysis, examples, synonyms, antonyms, or usage examples in the requested format.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:** Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name, place, or brand.
* **It's a word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.
* **It's a newly coined word or slang:**  New words are constantly being created.

If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, the surrounding text, etc.), I might be able to offer a more informed response.
