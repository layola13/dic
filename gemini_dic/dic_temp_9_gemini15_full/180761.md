regularizers:/ˈrɛɡjələraɪzərz/| n. |正则化器，正则项|Terms or functions added to a model's objective function to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.  They penalize complex models, encouraging simpler solutions that are less prone to memorizing the training data and better at predicting unseen data.  Common examples include L1 and L2 regularization.|Example:  The model's performance improved significantly after applying L2 regularizers.  正则化器应用后，模型的性能得到了显著提高。|近义词：penalty terms, regularization terms|反义词：None (it's a technique, not something with a direct opposite)|名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the context of machine learning and statistics, so grammatical examples in the typical tenses are not applicable.  Instead, here are examples demonstrating its use in different contexts within that field:


Defining Regularizers:

L1 regularizers are also known as Lasso regularization. = L1正则化器也被称为Lasso正则化。
L2 regularizers are also known as Ridge regularization. = L2正则化器也被称为Ridge正则化。


Describing the application of regularizers:

We used L1 regularizers to reduce the number of features in our model. = 我们使用L1正则化器来减少模型中的特征数量。
Applying different regularizers resulted in varying degrees of model complexity. = 应用不同的正则化器导致了不同程度的模型复杂性。


Comparing Regularizers:

The impact of L1 regularizers on feature selection is greater than that of L2 regularizers.= L1正则化器对特征选择的影响大于L2正则化器。
The choice between L1 and L2 regularizers depends on the specific dataset and model. = L1和L2正则化器的选择取决于特定的数据集和模型。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "regularizers". The term is used within technical descriptions and equations rather than in everyday language.  Examples are more likely to be found in the context of  mathematical formulations:

L1 regularization term = L1正则化项
L2 regularization term = L2正则化项
regularization strength = 正则化强度
applying regularizers = 应用正则化器
effect of regularizers = 正则化器的效果
