Etymology:

The word "illiterateness" is derived from the adjective "illiterate" and the suffix "-ness."

* **illiterate:** This word itself is a combination of "il-" (a negative prefix meaning "not") and "literate."
* **literate:**  This stems from the Latin word "litteratus," meaning "educated,"  "learned," or "versed in letters."  This, in turn, comes from "littera," meaning "letter" (of the alphabet).


Therefore, the entire etymology traces back to the Latin root meaning "letter" and expresses the concept of "not having knowledge of letters" or being uneducated.
