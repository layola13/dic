hydrogenize:/ˈhaɪdrədʒənaɪz/ | vt. |使氢化；加氢 |To combine (a substance) with hydrogen, especially by catalytic action. This process is often used in the chemical industry to saturate unsaturated compounds, turning them into saturated ones.  For example, vegetable oils can be hydrogenated to create margarine. |例句：The unsaturated fats in the oil were hydrogenated to make it solid at room temperature. 油中的不饱和脂肪被氢化以使其在室温下呈固态。

The process hydrogenates the liquid oil, changing its properties.  该过程使液态油氢化，改变了它的特性。| 近义词：saturate (in the context of adding hydrogen) | 反义词：dehydrogenate | 词性:动词


USAGE->
