词性：形容词


词源:

* **quasi-**:  from Latin *quasi* meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation.

* **critical**: from Greek *kritikos* meaning "able to judge," deriving from *krinein* meaning "to separate," "to decide," or "to judge."  This root gives rise to the modern understanding of critical as involving judgment, analysis, and evaluation.

Therefore, "quasi-critically" combines the sense of "almost" or "resembling" with the act of critical judgment, resulting in a description of something that appears critical but falls short of complete critical analysis.
