词源:
The word "oversentimentalize" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and the verb "sentimentalize," which itself comes from the adjective "sentimental" (from the French word "sentimental," ultimately derived from the Latin word "sentire," meaning "to feel").  Therefore, "oversentimentalize" means to make something excessively sentimental.
