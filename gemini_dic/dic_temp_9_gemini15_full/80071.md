词源:
The word "goaltender" is a compound word.  "Goal" refers to the objective in a game, and "tender" means one who cares for or protects something.  Therefore, a goaltender is literally one who tends or protects the goal.  The word evolved from the older term "goalkeeper," which is still commonly used, especially in soccer.
