sarcoblast:/ˈsɑːrkəʊblæst/| n. |肌原细胞|A sarcoblast is a cell that develops into a muscle fiber (myocyte).  It's a precursor cell during myogenesis, the process of muscle formation.  Sarcoblast are involved in the development and regeneration of muscle tissue.|Example:  During embryonic development, sarcoblast differentiate and fuse to form multinucleated muscle fibers.|近义词：myoblast|反义词：无
