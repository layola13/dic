greisen:/ˈɡraɪzən/| n.|格里森岩|A greisen is a type of rock formed by the alteration of granite or other igneous rocks by hydrothermal fluids.  It is typically composed of quartz and muscovite, often with topaz, tourmaline, and other minerals. Greisens are often associated with tin, tungsten, and molybdenum deposits.|The greisenization process involved the introduction of volatiles and elements such as fluorine and boron.|格里森化过程涉及挥发物和氟、硼等元素的引入。|近义词：altered granite, hydrothermal alteration product|反义词：N/A
