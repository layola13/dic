词源:
The word "extraneize" is a relatively recent coinage, derived from the German word "Verfremdungseffekt" (estrangement effect), a term coined by Bertolt Brecht to describe a theatrical technique aimed at preventing the audience from becoming too emotionally involved in the play.  The prefix "extra-" suggests "outside" or "beyond," implying a removal from familiarity.  The suffix "-ize" indicates the act of making something.
