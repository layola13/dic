词源：

The word "shareholding" is a compound word.  "Share" comes from Old English *scearu, meaning "a portion, a part," and ultimately from Proto-Germanic *skairō. "Holding" is a gerund form of the verb "to hold," originating from Old English *haldan, meaning "to possess, to keep."  Therefore, "shareholding" literally signifies the act of possessing or owning a share or shares.
