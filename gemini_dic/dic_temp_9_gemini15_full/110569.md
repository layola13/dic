The word "limitaneous" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established meaning, pronunciation, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis following the specified format.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure field.  If you could provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more informed response.
