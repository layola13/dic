lakyn:/ˈleɪkɪn/| n. |莱肯（人名）| Lakyn is a fairly modern given name, primarily used for girls.  It's a variant spelling of the name  Laken, which itself has various possible origins. One possible origin is from the Old English word "lake," meaning a body of water, potentially signifying someone near or associated with a lake. Another suggestion traces it to the name "Lakin," a diminutive of "Lachlan."  It doesn't have a wide range of established meanings or strong historical connections like some older names.|Example: My friend Lakyn is a talented artist. 我的朋友莱肯是一位有才华的艺术家。|近义词:Laken,  Lacy (similar sound)|反义词:N/A|名词
