exothermicity:/ˌɛksoʊθɜːrmɪˈsɪti/| n. |放热性，放热反应|The property of a reaction or process that releases heat to its surroundings.|The combustion of methane is a classic example of exothermicity, releasing a significant amount of heat.|近义词：heat release, heat evolution|反义词：endothermicity


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The reaction shows significant exothermicity. = 反应显示出明显的放热性。
This process exhibits high exothermicity. = 这个过程表现出高放热性。


一般过去时:
The experiment demonstrated high exothermicity. = 实验显示出高放热性。
The reaction's exothermicity was measured. = 反应的放热性被测量了。


现在完成时:
Scientists have observed significant exothermicity in this reaction. = 科学家们在这个反应中观察到了明显的放热性。
Researchers have confirmed the high exothermicity of the process. = 研究人员证实了该过程的高放热性。


过去完成时:
The researchers had already noted the exothermicity before the experiment concluded. = 研究人员在实验结束前就已经注意到了放热性。
They had anticipated the high exothermicity of the reaction. = 他们已经预料到反应的高放热性。


将来时:
The experiment will likely demonstrate substantial exothermicity. = 实验很可能显示出大量的放热性。
We expect the process to exhibit considerable exothermicity. = 我们预计该过程将表现出相当大的放热性。


虚拟语气:
If the reaction had more exothermicity, it would be more efficient. = 如果反应有更高的放热性，它将更有效率。
It is important that the reaction possess sufficient exothermicity. = 反应具有足够的放热性是很重要的。


被动语态:
The exothermicity of the reaction was carefully monitored. = 反应的放热性被仔细监测。
The high exothermicity was attributed to the catalyst used. = 高放热性归因于所使用的催化剂。


疑问句:
What is the exothermicity of this chemical reaction? = 这个化学反应的放热性是多少？
Does this process exhibit any significant exothermicity? = 这个过程是否表现出任何明显的放热性？


否定句:
The reaction did not show any significant exothermicity. = 该反应没有显示任何明显的放热性。
The process lacked the necessary exothermicity for efficient operation. = 该过程缺乏高效运行所需的放热性。



PHRASE->
high exothermicity 高放热性
significant exothermicity 明显的放热性
degree of exothermicity 放热程度
measurement of exothermicity 放热性的测量
control of exothermicity 放热性的控制
