词源:
The word "control" comes from the Old French word "controller," which means "to check" or "to verify."  This, in turn, is derived from the Medieval Latin word "contrarotulare," meaning "to counter-roll" (as in, to check a roll of accounts against another).  The "counter" prefix reflects the idea of comparison or verification, highlighting the checking aspect of the word's origins.
