词源:
The word "predefaulted" is a relatively recent addition to the English lexicon, formed by adding the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "prior to") to the past participle of the verb "default."  This indicates that the default occurred before a specific point in time or before a certain action was taken.  The root "default" itself comes from the Old French word "defaut," meaning "defect" or "lack."
