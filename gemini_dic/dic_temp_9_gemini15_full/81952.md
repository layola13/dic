词源:

The word "griminess" derives from the adjective "grim," which ultimately comes from Old Norse "grimr," meaning "fierce, cruel, wrathful."  Over time, "grim" acquired a secondary meaning associated with something unpleasant and dirty.  The suffix "-iness" is added to create the noun "griminess," indicating a state or quality of being grim (in its secondary sense).
