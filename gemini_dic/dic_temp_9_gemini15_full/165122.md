The word "preincludes" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis following your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  To provide a helpful response, I need clarification on the intended word.  Is there a similar-sounding or related word you meant to use?  Perhaps providing the context in which you encountered "preincludes" would help.
