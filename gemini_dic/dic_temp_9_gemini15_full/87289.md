词源：  From Late Latin *hermeticus, from Greek Hermeticos, from Hermes, the Greek god associated with alchemy and magic.  The term originally referred to writings attributed to Hermes Trismegistus, a legendary figure believed to possess esoteric knowledge.  The association with airtight seals developed later, possibly due to the alchemists' use of sealed vessels in their experiments.
