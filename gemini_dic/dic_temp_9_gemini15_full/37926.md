completednesses: /kəmˈpliːtɪdnəsɪz/ | n. | 完成状态的复数 | The state of being completed; multiple instances of completion.  This word is extremely rare and largely considered incorrect or overly verbose.  It's better to use simpler phrasing like "completions" or "instances of completion." |  The professor evaluated the students' completednesses across multiple projects.  教授评估了学生在多个项目中的完成情况。(Note:  This sentence is grammatically correct but stylistically awkward. "The professor evaluated the students' project completions" would be far preferable.) | completions, fulfillments | incompletions, failures | 名词
