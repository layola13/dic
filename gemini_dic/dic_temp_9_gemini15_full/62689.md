词源:
The word "engender" comes from the Old French word "engendrer," meaning "to beget; to produce."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "ingenerare,"  a combination of "in-" (in) and "generare" (to beget, to produce).  The root "generare" is related to the Latin word "genus," meaning "kind," "race," or "birth."
