Etymology:

The name "February" derives from the Latin word *februarius*, meaning "purification."  This is linked to the Roman festival of purification, *Februa*, which was held during this month.  The month's association with purification likely stems from its position at the beginning of the agricultural year in the Roman calendar, before the spring planting season.
