electroviscosity: /ɪˌlɛktrəʊvɪsˈkɒsɪti/ | n. | 电粘度 | The increase in viscosity of a fluid under the influence of an electric field.  This phenomenon arises from the polarization of particles within the fluid, leading to increased interparticle forces and resistance to flow. | Example: The researchers observed a significant increase in electroviscosity when a high voltage was applied to the suspension.  研究人员在对悬浮液施加高电压时观察到电粘度显着增加。 | 近义词: electrophoretic viscosity | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, but the absence of an electric field would result in a lower viscosity.) |
