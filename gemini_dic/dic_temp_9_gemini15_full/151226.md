parelectronomic: /ˌpærɪˌɛləkˈtrɒnɪk/ | adj. | 副电子的 | Relating to or denoting the parelectronic state of an atom, molecule, or ion.  This refers to a state where the number of electrons in the atom/molecule/ion is greater than the number of protons.  The term is less common and primarily used in advanced chemistry and physics. |  The parelectronomic state of the ion was analyzed using advanced spectroscopic techniques.  | 近义词: (No direct synonyms, as the term is highly specialized) | 反义词: (No direct antonyms, needs a contrasting concept like isoelectronic) | 词性: adjective
