词源:

The word "extortionate" derives from the noun "extortion," which comes from the Old French word "extorcion" and ultimately from the Latin word "extortio," meaning "a wrenching out, extortion." The Latin word is formed from "extorquere," meaning "to twist out, wrest away by force," which is composed of the prefix "ex-" (out) and "torquere" (to twist).  Thus, the core meaning revolves around forcefully taking something from someone.  The "-ate" suffix transforms the noun into an adjective, describing something characterized by extortion.
