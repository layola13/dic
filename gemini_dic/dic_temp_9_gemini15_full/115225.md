词源:

The word "manifolded" comes from the Middle English word "manifold," which itself originates from the Old English "manigfald," meaning "many-fold."  The prefix "mani-" is related to "many," and "-fold" indicates a multiple or repetition.  The "-ed" suffix transforms the adjective "manifold" into its past participle form, often used attributively.
