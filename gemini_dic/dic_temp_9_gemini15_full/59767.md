词源:
The word "economize" comes from the Old French word "economiser," which in turn derives from the Late Latin word "oeconomicus." This ultimately traces back to the Greek word "οἰκονομικός" (oikonomikos), meaning "of household management," from "οἶκος" (oikos, "house") + "νέμειν" (nemein, "to manage").  The core meaning of managing resources efficiently has evolved into the modern sense of saving or conserving.
