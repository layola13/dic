overtimidities:/ˌoʊvərˈtɪmɪdətiz/| n.|过度胆怯；过分胆小；胆怯过度|The word "overtimidities" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a neologism, formed by combining "over" (meaning excessively) and "timidities" (plural of timidity, meaning shyness or lack of confidence).  Therefore, a precise definition and usage examples are difficult to provide. However, based on its construction, it would likely refer to excessive instances or displays of shyness or fear.|例句：There is no standard usage of this word, as it is not established in the lexicon.  An example sentence using it would be contrived and thus unhelpful.|近义词:excessive shyness, extreme timidity, overcautiousness|反义词:boldness, courage, audacity|名词
