词源：
The word "chorus" comes from the Ancient Greek word  χορός (chorós), meaning "dance," "band of dancers," or "crowd."  In ancient Greek theatre, the chorus was a group of performers who sang and danced, commenting on the action of the play.  Over time, the meaning evolved to primarily refer to the group of singers in a musical piece and the repeated section of a song.
