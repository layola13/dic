recursions:/rɪˈkɜːʒənz/ | n. | 递归；循环 | The process of a function calling itself, either directly or indirectly.  It's a fundamental concept in computer science and mathematics.  Recursive functions break down a problem into smaller, self-similar subproblems until a base case is reached, at which point the recursion stops and the results are combined back up.  | Example:  The calculation of the factorial of a number is a classic example of recursion.  The factorial of n (n!) is defined as n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1.  A recursive function would calculate n! by calling itself with n-1, then n-2, and so on, until it reaches the base case of 1!. | 近义词：iteration, repetition | 反义词：iteration (in some contexts, as recursion and iteration are different approaches to solving repetitive tasks) |
