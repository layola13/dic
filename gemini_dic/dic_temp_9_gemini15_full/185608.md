Etymology:

The word "revengeless" is formed from the word "revenge" and the suffix "-less".  "Revenge" originates from Old French "revenger" (to avenge), ultimately from Latin "re-" (again) + "vindecta" (vengeance). "-less" is a common English suffix indicating the absence or lack of something.  Therefore, "revengeless" literally means "without revenge".
