词源:

The word "diligence" comes from the Old French word "diligence," meaning "care," "attention," or "effort."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "diligentia," which is a combination of "diligens," meaning "careful" or "attentive," and the suffix "-ia," forming a noun.  "Diligens" itself is formed from "diligere," meaning "to choose carefully," "to love," or "to esteem."  Therefore, the root meaning emphasizes careful selection and attention to detail.
