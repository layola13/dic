The word "poseyer" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a specific dialect or jargon, or a proper noun.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide the requested information, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered "poseyer."
