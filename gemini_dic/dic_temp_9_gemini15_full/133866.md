用法说明：

This adverb is used to describe actions or offers that are not free, not given out of kindness or generosity, but rather for a specific reason, often self-serving.  It highlights the lack of altruism or goodwill involved.  The word carries a negative connotation, suggesting that the action is motivated by something other than genuine helpfulness or goodwill.
