词源:

The word "estrogen" is derived from the Greek words "oestrus" (οἶστρος), meaning "frenzy" or "madness" (referring to the heat in animals), and "-gen," meaning "producing" or "forming."  Therefore, estrogen literally means "heat-producing" or "frenzy-producing," referring to its role in the estrous cycle.
