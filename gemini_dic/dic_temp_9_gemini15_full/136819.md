/ˌnɒnˈsɪbɪlənsɪz/| n. |非咝音|Nonsibilances are sounds in speech that are not produced with the tongue close to the teeth, creating a hissing or buzzing sound.  They are sounds that lack the characteristic friction or "hissing" quality of sibilants.  This contrasts with sounds like /s/, /z/, /ʃ/, /ʒ/, /tʃ/, and /dʒ/, which are all sibilants.|The study of phonetics often distinguishes between sibilants and nonsibilants.  For example, the /p/ sound in "pen" is a nonsibilant, while the /s/ sound in "sun" is a sibilant. |近义词：non-fricatives (in some contexts)|反义词：sibilants|名词
