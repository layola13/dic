词源:  The word "cuckoldy" derives from the word "cuckold," which itself has a long and complex history.  The original Old French word "cucul" referred to a cuckoo bird, known for its habit of laying its eggs in other birds' nests. This behavior was metaphorically extended to describe a man whose wife is unfaithful, as the cuckoo's egg is a deceptive imposition in the nest.  The suffix "-y" adds an adjectival quality, signifying "full of," "characterized by," or "tending towards."  Therefore, "cuckoldy" describes something or someone exhibiting the characteristics of a cuckold – betrayal, deception, and humiliation within a relationship.
