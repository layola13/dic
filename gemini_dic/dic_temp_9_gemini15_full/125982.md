musket:/ˈmʌskɪt/| n.|火枪|A musket is a type of firearm that was widely used from the 16th to the 19th centuries.  It is a smoothbore shoulder firearm, meaning it has a smooth barrel (unlike a rifle, which has a rifled barrel) and is fired from the shoulder.  Muskets were heavier and less accurate than later firearms, but were effective in massed formations. |Example: The soldiers marched forward, their muskets gleaming in the sun.  士兵们向前行进，他们的火枪在阳光下闪闪发光。|近义词：firearm, gun|反义词：sword, bow and arrow
