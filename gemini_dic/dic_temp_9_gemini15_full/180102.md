词源:

The word "reflow" is a combination of the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the verb "flow."  The sense of "flowing" text or images reflects the way elements rearrange themselves in a new layout.  The use of "reflow" in the context of typography and page layout gained prominence with the rise of desktop publishing and digital design.
