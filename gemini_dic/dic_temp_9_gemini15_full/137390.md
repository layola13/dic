/ˌnɑːnˈtɛnəblˈnɛsɪz/ | n. | 不可维持性；站不住脚的事实；无法辩护的理由 | The nontenablenesses of the defendant's arguments were readily apparent to the jury.  被告的论点站不住脚，陪审团很容易就看出来了。| 近义词：unjustifiability, invalidity, untenability | 反义词：validity, justifiability, defensibility | 名词


This word is extremely rare and not commonly used.  It's a noun formed from the adjective "untenable," meaning incapable of being defended or maintained.  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective into a noun, and the "-es" indicates a plural form. Therefore, "nontenablenesses" refers to multiple instances or aspects of something being indefensible or unsustainable.

Because of its rarity, providing extensive grammatical examples (like those requested for "what") is impractical. The grammatical usage would follow standard plural noun patterns.  For example:

* **Simple Present:** The nontenablenesses of his claims were obvious. (他的说法站不住脚，显而易见。)
* **Simple Past:** The nontenablenesses of the previous arguments became clear after further investigation. (经过进一步调查，之前的论点站不住脚变得清晰了。)


There are no common phrases or idioms using "nontenablenesses".  The word itself is so uncommon that creating example sentences beyond simple grammatical structures would be artificial and unhelpful.  The focus should be on understanding the meaning and its derivational history from "untenable."
