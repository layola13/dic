The word "copile" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "compile," "co-pilot," or another word entirely.
2. **It's a neologism or technical term:**  It might be a newly coined word or a term used within a specific field or community.
3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or place name.
