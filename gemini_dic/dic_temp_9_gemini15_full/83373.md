gyroscope:/ˈdʒaɪrəˌskoʊp/| n. |陀螺仪，回转仪 |A gyroscope is a spinning wheel or disc in a frame that is free to turn in any direction. It maintains its orientation regardless of the motion of the frame, making it useful for navigation and stabilization.  |Example: The airplane uses a gyroscope to maintain its balance.  这架飞机使用陀螺仪来保持平衡。  The ship's navigation system relies on a sophisticated gyroscope. 这艘船的导航系统依赖于一个复杂的陀螺仪。|近义词：stabilizer, rotational sensor |反义词：None.

词源:
The word "gyroscope" comes from the Greek words  γῦρος (gyros), meaning "circle" or "rotation," and σκοπέω (skopeō), meaning "to see" or "to observe."  It literally means "circle viewer" or "rotation observer," reflecting its function of observing and measuring rotation.
