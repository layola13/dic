词源:
The word "mitrailleuse" is a French word.  It's derived from the French word "mitraille," meaning "grapeshot" (a type of ammunition consisting of a cluster of small shot fired from a cannon), plus the suffix "-euse," which indicates a device or agent.  Therefore, it literally means "grapeshot-making machine" or "machine that fires grapeshot," reflecting the early machine guns' firing of multiple projectiles rapidly.
