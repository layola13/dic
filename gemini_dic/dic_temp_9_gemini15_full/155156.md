词源:

The word "petty bourgeois" is a compound word.  "Petty" comes from Old French *petiz, meaning "small," and ultimately from Latin *parvus, also meaning "small." "Bourgeois" comes from Old French *bourgeois, referring to an inhabitant of a borough or town, and ultimately from Latin *burgensis, meaning "citizen of a borough." The term "bourgeoisie" historically referred to the middle class, particularly those who owned property or businesses but did not belong to the aristocracy or landed gentry.  The "petty" prefix specifies a lower or less significant segment of this middle class, often associated with small-scale businesses or trades.


用法说明:

The term "petty bourgeois" is often used in Marxist and socialist theory to describe a social class situated between the proletariat (working class) and the bourgeoisie (capitalist class).  It encompasses small business owners, shopkeepers, independent professionals, and others who own the means of production but on a small scale.  The term is frequently used critically, highlighting characteristics such as conservatism, materialism, and a tendency to uphold the existing social order.  It's important to note that the usage and connotations of the term vary across different contexts and ideological perspectives.  In some instances, it might be used descriptively without the negative connotations.
