hexahedrons: /ˌhɛksəˈhiːdrɒnz/ | n. | 六面体复数 | Six-sided solid figures;  polyhedrons with six faces.  |例句：The crystal structure of salt is composed of many hexahedrons.  盐的晶体结构是由许多六面体组成的。

The model displayed various hexahedrons, each a different color and size. 模型展示了各种六面体，每个都有不同的颜色和大小。


近义词：six-sided solids, hexahedra (单数) | 反义词：无直接反义词，可考虑与其他多面体对比，如tetrahedrons (四面体)


词源：hexa- (six) + hedron (face, side)  源自希腊语，hexa 表示“六”，hedron 表示“面”。
