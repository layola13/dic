词源:

The word "nincompoop" (the singular form) is of uncertain origin, but it's likely a blend or alteration of earlier words.  Some etymological suggestions involve combining elements like "ninny" (a fool) and possibly "compoop" (a possible obsolete term, perhaps related to "comptroller," implying incompetence in managing things).  The "-eries" suffix is added to create a plural form and implies a collection or series of actions.  Therefore, "nincompooperies" refers to multiple instances of foolish behavior or statements.
