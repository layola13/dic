halophytism:/ˈhæləˌfɪtɪzəm/| n. |嗜盐性，盐生植物特性|The ability of plants to tolerate and thrive in saline conditions.  Halophytism involves physiological and morphological adaptations to survive high salt concentrations.  These adaptations might include salt exclusion, salt secretion, or succulence. |Example: The halophytism of mangroves allows them to flourish in coastal areas with high salinity.  嗜盐植物红树林的嗜盐性使其能够在高盐度的沿海地区繁盛。|近义词: salt tolerance, salinity tolerance |反义词: glycophytism (the ability to thrive in non-saline conditions)
