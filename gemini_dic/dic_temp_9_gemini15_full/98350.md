Etymology:

The word "insipidness" derives from the adjective "insipid," which itself comes from the Latin word "insipidus."  "In-" is a negative prefix, while "sipidus" relates to "sapor," meaning "taste" or "flavor." Therefore, "insipidus" originally meant "tasteless" or "without flavor."  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being insipid.
