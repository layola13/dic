词源:
The word "multitiered" is a combination of "multi-" (meaning many or multiple) and "tiered" (meaning arranged in tiers or layers).  "Tier" itself originates from the Old French "tierce," meaning "third," referring to a third part or division.  Over time, it evolved to describe a row or rank, leading to its current meaning of a level or layer in a structure.
