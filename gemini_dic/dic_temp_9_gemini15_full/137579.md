nontransposable: /ˌnɒn trænsˈpoʊzəbəl/ | adj. |不可转位的，不可易位的|  Not capable of being transposed or moved from one place to another.  The term often refers to genetic elements, specifically those that cannot be moved from one location in a genome to another. | Example:  The nontransposable element remained fixed in its chromosomal location.  这个不可转位的元件保持在其染色体位置不变。 | 近义词: immobile, fixed, stationary | 反义词: transposable, movable, mobile


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a scientific context, particularly in genetics and molecular biology.  Therefore, grammatical tense usage depends on the specific sentence construction within a scientific paper or report. Examples below illustrate possible uses:

Present Simple:
This gene is nontransposable. = 这个基因是不可转位的。
The element remains nontransposable under these conditions. = 在这些条件下，该元件保持不可转位。


Past Simple:
The researchers found the sequence to be nontransposable. = 研究人员发现该序列是不可转位的。
The experiment demonstrated that the fragment was nontransposable. = 实验表明该片段是不可转位的。


Present Perfect:
Scientists have identified many nontransposable elements in the human genome. = 科学家已经在人类基因组中发现了许多不可转位的元件。
We have confirmed that this segment is nontransposable. = 我们已经证实了这部分是不可转位的。



Future Simple:
Future studies will examine whether this newly discovered element is nontransposable. = 未来的研究将考察这个新发现的元件是否不可转位。

PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "nontransposable".  The term is highly technical and used within specific scientific contexts.  


词源:

The word "nontransposable" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"),  "transposable" (capable of being transposed or moved), which itself derives from "transpose" (to move from one place to another), and the suffix "-able" (capable of being).  The root of "transpose" comes from the Latin "trans-" (across, beyond) and "ponere" (to place).
