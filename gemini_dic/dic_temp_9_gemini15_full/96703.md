词源:

* **in-**:  prefix meaning "not" or "without"
* **efface**: verb meaning "to wipe out," "to erase," or "to obliterate."  It comes from the Old French *efacer*, from *e-* (out) + *facer* (to make).  *Facer* is related to the Latin *facere* (to do or make).

Therefore, *ineffaceable* literally means "not able to be erased."
