devaporation:/ˌdiːˌevæpəˈreɪʃən/| n. |脱水；蒸发减少|The process by which the rate of evaporation is reduced, often through external intervention.  This is not a standard English word; it's likely a neologism or a misspelling. It seems to combine "de-" (meaning removal or reduction) and "evaporation".  A more accurate term would depend on the context.  For example, if referring to reducing the rate of evaporation, "evaporation suppression" or "reduction of evaporation" would be better choices. |例句: The experiment aimed to measure the devaporation of water from the soil under different conditions.  (This sentence uses the word, but it's not grammatically correct or standard usage.) |近义词:  evaporation reduction,  desiccation (if referring to drying), dehydration (if referring to biological processes) |反义词:  increased evaporation, hydration (if referring to biological processes) |名词
