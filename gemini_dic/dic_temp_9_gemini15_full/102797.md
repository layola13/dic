The word "jards" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "yards," "jards" (a possible regional dialect word), or something else entirely?

* **It's a proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (like a place name or a person's name) that isn't widely known.

* **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word or a slang term used within a specific community or context.


To provide the analysis you requested, I need the correct spelling or more context about where you encountered this word.
