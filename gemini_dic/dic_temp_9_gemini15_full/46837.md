词源: The word "dapper" likely originated in the early 19th century, possibly from a Dutch word meaning "brave" or "active," or perhaps from a Scottish word with a similar meaning.  Its exact etymology remains somewhat uncertain.  However, its current meaning developed from the connotation of neatness and alertness associated with these earlier senses.
