equant:/ˈiːkwɒnt/| n.| 均匀点，等分点 | In astronomy, an equant is a point offset from the center of a circular orbit around which a planet appeared to move at a uniform rate.  This was a crucial element in the geocentric model of the solar system developed by Ptolemy.  | Example: Ptolemy's model of planetary motion utilized an equant to account for observed irregularities. 托勒密行星运动模型利用均分点来解释观察到的不规则性。| 近义词：center (in a limited context) | 反义词：irregular point, eccentric point| 名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily a historical term used in the context of astronomy. Therefore, the grammatical usage examples below are limited and contextualized to this specific application.  There are no common everyday uses that would warrant typical tense conjugations.
