Etymology:

The word "mutualness" is derived from the adjective "mutual," which ultimately comes from the Latin word "mutuus," meaning "interchanged," "borrowed," or "reciprocal."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun, indicating the state or quality of being mutual.  Therefore, "mutualness" signifies the quality or condition of being shared, reciprocal, or interdependent.
