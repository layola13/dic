词源:
The word "engraftment" comes from the verb "engraft," which itself is a combination of "en-" (meaning "in" or "into") and "graft" (meaning to insert a cutting from a plant into another plant to grow).  The "-ment" suffix indicates a process or result.  Therefore, "engraftment" literally means the act or process of grafting or inserting something into something else.
