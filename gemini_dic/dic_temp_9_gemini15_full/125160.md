multiaxially:/ˌmʌltiˈæksiəli/| adj. |多轴向的，多轴线的|  Relating to or having multiple axes.  This term is often used in materials science and engineering to describe the properties of materials subjected to stresses or strains along multiple axes. For example, a material might be described as having multiaxially aligned fibers if its reinforcing fibers are aligned in multiple directions.  |例句：The composite material exhibited superior strength due to its multiaxially oriented fibers.  该复合材料由于其多轴取向纤维而表现出优异的强度。

The stress test subjected the component to multiaxial loading.  该应力测试使部件承受多轴载荷。|近义词：multidirectional, polyaxial |反义词：uniaxial, monoaxial


USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective and doesn't have verb conjugations or tenses like "What" does.  Therefore, standard tense breakdowns (present, past, future etc.) are not applicable.  The usage is always descriptive.


PHRASE->
