词源:
The word "energised" comes from the noun "energy" and the suffix "-ised" (or "-ized" in American English), which is a common suffix used to form verbs or adjectives indicating the process of making something or becoming something.  "Energy" itself has roots in the Greek word "energeia," meaning "activity," "operation," or "work."
