quasi-prompt:/ˈkwɑːziˌprɒmpt/ | adj. | 准提示；类似提示的 |  Relating to or resembling a prompt, but not fully or strictly a prompt.  It often refers to a stimulus that is similar to a prompt in its effect, but may lack some of the defining characteristics of a traditional prompt. For example, in the context of large language models, a quasi-prompt might be an indirect or subtle suggestion rather than a direct instruction. | The model generated a coherent response even without a direct prompt; it seemed to be triggered by a quasi-prompt in the previous conversation.  |近义词：near-prompt, suggestive, implicit | 反义词：explicit prompt, direct instruction |
