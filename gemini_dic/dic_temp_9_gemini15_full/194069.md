词源:
The term "self-help" is a compound word combining "self" and "help".  "Self" refers to oneself, and "help" signifies assistance or aid.  The term emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, gaining prominence as a distinct category of literature and practice in the latter half of the 20th century.  The rise of self-help can be linked to increased individualism and a focus on personal growth and responsibility.
