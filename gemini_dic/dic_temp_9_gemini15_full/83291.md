gynander:/ˈɡaɪnændər/| n.|雌雄同体（生物）|A gynander is an organism that possesses both male and female reproductive organs or characteristics.  It's often used in biology and botany to describe individuals exhibiting intersex traits.  The term implies a mixture of male and female characteristics, not necessarily a perfect 50/50 blend.|Example: The butterfly displayed gynandromorphism, exhibiting characteristics of both male and female on opposite sides of its body.  这只蝴蝶表现出雌雄嵌合现象，在其身体的相对两侧展现出雄性和雌性的特征。|近义词：hermaphrodite, intersex|反义词：unisex, monosexual
