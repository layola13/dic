词源：

The word "maudlin" (and hence "maudlinness") ultimately derives from the name "Mary Magdalene," a significant figure in the Christian Gospels.  Over time, artistic depictions often portrayed Mary Magdalene as excessively sorrowful and weeping, leading to the association of the name with excessive sentimentality.  The transition from the proper noun "Magdalene" to the adjective "maudlin" involved a series of phonetic shifts and semantic evolution.

用法说明:

Maudlinness is a noun describing a state or quality of being excessively sentimental, often to the point of being annoying or pathetic.  It implies an over-indulgence in feelings of sadness, pity, or self-pity, often expressed through tears or excessive displays of emotion.  The term carries a negative connotation, suggesting a lack of restraint or good judgment in expressing emotion.  It's often used to describe something overly emotional and melodramatic.
