divalent:/ˈdaɪveɪlənt/| adj.|二价的，二价态的|Having a valency of two; able to form two chemical bonds.|例句：Calcium is a divalent metal. 钙是一种二价金属。

例句：Many transition metals can exist in divalent states. 许多过渡金属可以以二价态存在。


近义词：bivalent|反义词：monovalent, trivalent


词源:
The word "divalent" comes from the combination of "di-" (meaning "two") and "valent" (relating to valency or combining power in chemistry).  "Valent" itself originates from the Latin word "valēns," meaning "strong" or "powerful," referring to the strength of an element's bonding capacity.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The calcium ion is divalent. = 钙离子是二价的。
This compound contains a divalent metal. = 这种化合物含有二价金属。


一般过去时:
The experiment showed the ion was divalent. = 实验表明该离子是二价的。
Scientists determined the metal to be divalent. = 科学家确定该金属为二价的。


现在完成时:
Researchers have confirmed that the element is divalent. = 研究人员已经证实该元素是二价的。
Chemists have identified several divalent compounds. = 化学家已经鉴定了几种二价化合物。


过去完成时:
They had already known the cation was divalent before the analysis. = 他们在分析之前就已经知道阳离子是二价的了。
Scientists had discovered that the element exhibited divalent properties. = 科学家们已经发现该元素表现出二价特性。


将来时:
The analysis will show that the ion is divalent. = 分析将表明该离子是二价的。
Future studies will explore the divalent forms of this element. = 未来的研究将探索该元素的二价形式。


虚拟语气:
If it were divalent, it would react differently. = 如果它是二价的，它将以不同的方式反应。
If the metal were divalent, the compound would be more stable. = 如果金属是二价的，化合物将更稳定。


被动语态:
The compound was shown to be divalent by the analysis. = 分析表明该化合物是二价的。
The divalent nature of the metal ion was confirmed by experiment. = 实验证实了金属离子的二价性质。


疑问句:
Is this ion divalent? = 这个离子是二价的吗？
Is the metal in this compound divalent? = 这种化合物中的金属是二价的吗？


否定句:
The ion is not divalent; it's trivalent. = 该离子不是二价的；它是三价的。
This element does not exist in a divalent state under these conditions. = 在这些条件下，该元素不存在二价态。


PHRASE->
divalent cation = 二价阳离子
divalent metal = 二价金属
divalent ion = 二价离子
divalent compound = 二价化合物
divalent state = 二价态
