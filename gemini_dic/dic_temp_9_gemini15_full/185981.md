rewarrants: /ˌriːˈwɒrənts/ | n. | 再授权，重新授权 |  This word is not found in standard English dictionaries. It appears to be a blend or a newly coined word, possibly combining "re-" (again) and "warrants" (authorizations or justifications).

If encountered, one would need to understand the specific context in which it's used to determine its intended meaning.  For example, it might refer to a renewed authorization, a re-issuance of a warrant, or something similar. |  Example:  The court *rewarrants* the search of the property. (This is a hypothetical example based on a possible interpretation.) |  近义词: reauthorization, renewal, reissue  | 反义词: revocation, cancellation |  词性: Noun
