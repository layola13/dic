The word "pervicacy" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  To provide you with a helpful response, I need clarification:

1. **Is there a different word you intended to write?**  Please double-check the spelling.  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word, or a word with a related meaning.

2. **Is this a technical term from a specific field?**  If so, please provide the context where you encountered this word.

Once you provide this information, I can offer a more accurate analysis.
