词源:
The word "forgo" comes from Old English *forgān,  meaning "to go without,"  a combination of the preposition "for" and the verb "go".  The "for" indicates deprivation or lack, while "go" refers to the act of leaving something behind or passing it by.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the deliberate act of relinquishing something.
