词源：

The word "misconstructions" is derived from the verb "misconstrue," which itself is a combination of the prefix "mis-" (meaning "wrongly" or "badly") and the verb "construe," meaning "to interpret" or "to understand."  "Construe" ultimately comes from the Latin verb "construere," meaning "to build" or "to construct," reflecting the idea of building an interpretation from available information.

It is typically used to describe situations where multiple people have misunderstood something, or where a single thing has been misunderstood in multiple ways.  It carries a negative connotation, implying that the misunderstanding has led to problems or confusion.
