mio:/ˈmiːoʊ/| pron.|我的（意大利语）|It is the Italian word for "my".  It's used as a possessive pronoun, indicating ownership or belonging.|Questo è mio. = This is mine. |近义词:mine(English)|反义词:yours, his, hers, theirs


USAGE->
This word is not used in English grammar in the same way as "what", "is", etc.  Therefore, grammatical conjugations like past tense, future tense, passive voice, etc., are not applicable.  It's a single word, a possessive pronoun used within the Italian language.  English grammar structures don't apply to it.


PHRASE->
Because "mio" is an Italian word, English phrases using it would be borrowed Italian phrases in English sentences, not English phrases themselves.  Examples:

Il mio libro = My book.
La mia casa = My house.
I miei amici = My friends.
Le mie sorelle = My sisters.
Il mio cane = My dog.
