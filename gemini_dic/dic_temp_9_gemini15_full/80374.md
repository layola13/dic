词源:  The word "links" in this context derives from the Old English word "hlinc," meaning a ridge or mound of land.  Over time, this evolved to refer to areas of undulating, often sandy, land suitable for the game of golf, particularly along coastlines. The term "golf-links" combines "golf" with "links" to specifically denote a golf course situated on this type of terrain.  The connection to the terrain is crucial; not all golf courses are golf links.
