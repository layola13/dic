nonintuitively:/ˌnɒnɪnˈtʃuːɪtɪvli/|/ˌnɑːnɪnˈtuːɪtɪvli/| adv.|非直觉地，违反直觉地 | Contrary to what one would intuitively expect.  This adverb describes something that is unexpected or surprising because it goes against common sense or intuition. | The software's interface was nonintuitively designed, making it difficult for users to navigate.  软件的界面设计反直觉，使用起来很困难。| intuitively, expectedly | intuitively, expectedly
