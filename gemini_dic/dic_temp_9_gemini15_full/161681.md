词源:
The word "pourveyance" comes from the Anglo-French word *purveiance*, which ultimately derives from the Old French *purveir* meaning "to provide, procure."  The "pur-" prefix suggests "forth" or "forward," while "-veir" relates to "to see" or "to look after."  Therefore, the original meaning encompassed the idea of looking ahead and providing for future needs.
