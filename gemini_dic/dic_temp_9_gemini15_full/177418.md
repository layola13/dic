rebalancing:/ˌriːˈbælənsɪŋ/ | v. n. | 再平衡；重新平衡；调整平衡 | The act of restoring equilibrium or balance; adjusting the proportions of a portfolio to maintain a desired asset allocation. |


英文解析:Rebalancing refers to the process of adjusting the proportions of assets in a portfolio to bring it back into line with the investor's original asset allocation strategy.  This is done to maintain a desired level of risk and return.  It involves selling some assets that have performed well and buying assets that have underperformed, thus re-establishing the target allocation.  Rebalancing can also apply to other contexts, such as adjusting the workload to maintain productivity.
