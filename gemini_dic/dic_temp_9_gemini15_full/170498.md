词源:  Derived from the verb "pry," meaning to inquire too closely into a person's private affairs.  The suffix "-ingly" transforms the verb into an adverb, indicating the manner in which the action is performed.  The root of "pry" is likely connected to Old English words relating to leverage or prying something open, suggesting an intrusive action.

USAGE->

例句二：She asked pryingly about his family background. 她打探性地询问了他的家庭背景。(Here, "pryingly" modifies the verb "asked")
