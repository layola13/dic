英文解析:

The adjective "numerable" means capable of being counted or numbered.  It implies that the items in question can be individually identified and tallied. While often used synonymously with "countable,"  "numerable" can sometimes carry a stronger sense of  a large, perhaps overwhelming, quantity that could theoretically be counted but is practically impossible to do so.

需要注意的是，虽然“numerable”和“countable”意思相近，但在使用中可能存在细微差别。“countable”更侧重于“能够被计数”的可能性，而“numerable”有时暗示数量之大，即使理论上可数，实际上也难以计数。
