词源:
The word "scurry" likely originates from a combination of Old English and Middle English terms, suggesting a connection to quick, scrambling movements. The exact etymology is somewhat debated, but it's likely a blend of onomatopoeic elements (words imitating sounds) and descriptive terms relating to rapid, disordered motion.  No single definitive source points to a concrete origin.
