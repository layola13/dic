词源:

* **low:**  Old English *lāg*, from Proto-Germanic *lagwaz, meaning "lying down", "low".  This root relates to the sense of something being physically lower.
* **resolution:**  Late Middle English: from Old French *resolucion, from Latin *resolutionem (nominative *resolutio), from *resolvere* "to loosen, untie, dissolve", from *re-* "again" + *solvere* "to loosen". In the context of images, resolution refers to the "untying" or breaking down of an image into its constituent parts (pixels).
