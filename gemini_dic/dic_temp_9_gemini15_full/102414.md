词源:
The word "jack" in this context ultimately derives from Old French *jacque, a diminutive of Jacques (James).  Its use to refer to a lifting device likely arose from its association with a type of small portable crane or hoist. The use of "jack" to refer to a sudden increase (like in "jack up the price") is a later development, likely a metaphorical extension of the lifting action.
