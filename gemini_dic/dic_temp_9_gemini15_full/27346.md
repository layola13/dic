词源:
The word "cambistry" is derived from the word "cambio," which is Italian for "exchange."  The word entered English in the 16th century, likely through the French "cambiste," referring to a money changer.  The suffix "-istry" denotes an art, science, or practice.  Therefore, cambistry signifies the art or practice of exchanging money or bills of exchange.
