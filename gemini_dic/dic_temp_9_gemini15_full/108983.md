词源:
The word "left-hand" is a compound word, combining "left" and "hand".  "Left" originates from Old English *lyft, meaning "weak, feeble".  This reflects the historical association of the left side with weakness or inferiority in many cultures. "Hand" has origins in Proto-Germanic *handuz and ultimately Proto-Indo-European *gʷʰendʰ-.
