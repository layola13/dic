photostable: /ˈfoʊtoʊˌsteɪbəl/ | adj. | 光稳定的；耐光的 | Resistant to degradation or change by exposure to light.  Photostable molecules maintain their chemical structure and properties when exposed to light, unlike photolabile molecules which readily decompose or change under similar conditions. | Example:  The newly synthesized dye is photostable and suitable for long-term use in sunlight.  这种新合成的染料具有光稳定性，适合在阳光下长期使用。 | 近义词：lightfast, light-stable | 反义词：photolabile, photosensitive
