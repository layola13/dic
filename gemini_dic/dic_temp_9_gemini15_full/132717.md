nondistributiveness:/ˌnɒnˌdɪstrɪˈbjuːtɪvnəs/ | n. |非分配性，非分配律| The property of an operation not satisfying the distributive law.  For example, in Boolean algebra, multiplication is distributive over addition (A*(B+C) = A*B + A*C), but addition is not distributive over multiplication (A+(B*C) ≠ (A+B)*(A+C)).  Nondistributiveness refers to the failure of this property. |Example: The nondistributiveness of the logical OR operator over the logical AND operator means that A ∨ (B ∧ C) ≠ (A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∨ C).  非逻辑或运算符对逻辑与运算符的非分配性意味着 A ∨ (B ∧ C) ≠ (A ∨ B) ∧ (A ∨ C).|近义词：lack of distributivity |反义词：distributivity |名词
