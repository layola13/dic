homomorphic:/ˌhoʊməˈmɔːrfɪk/| adj. |同态的；同形的| Preserving the structure of a mathematical system.  A homomorphic mapping is a function between two algebraic structures of the same type (e.g., two groups, two rings, or two vector spaces) that preserves the operations of the structures. For example, if we have a group homomorphism from group G to group H, then the image of the product of two elements in G is equal to the product of their images in H.  This concept is crucial in abstract algebra and has applications in cryptography and computer science.|Example:  The function f(x) = x² is a homomorphism from the group of real numbers under addition to the group of non-negative real numbers under multiplication.  f(x + y) = (x + y)² = x² + 2xy + y² ≠ f(x) * f(y) = x²y².  However, it is a homomorphism from the multiplicative group of positive real numbers into itself.  The mapping between a group of transformations and their associated matrices is often homomorphic.|近义词：isomorphic (in some contexts, depending on the specific type of structure and the properties preserved)|反义词：non-homomorphic


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in mathematical and technical contexts and doesn't have common usage in everyday conversations.  Therefore, providing example sentences across various tenses and grammatical structures would be artificial and unhelpful.  The examples below illustrate the concept in mathematical contexts.


Example 1 (Illustrating the concept):

The logarithm function is a homomorphism from the multiplicative group of positive real numbers to the additive group of real numbers.

对数函数是从正实数的乘法群到实数的加法群的同态映射。


Example 2 (Illustrating a specific application):

In cryptography, homomorphic encryption allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without decryption.

在密码学中，同态加密允许对加密数据进行计算而无需解密。


Example 3 (Illustrating a contrast):

While addition modulo n is a homomorphic operation, subtraction modulo n is not always a homomorphic operation.


虽然模n加法是同态运算，但模n减法并不总是同态运算。
