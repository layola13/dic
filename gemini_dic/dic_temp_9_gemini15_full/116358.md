词源:  The word "masticador" comes from the Latin verb "masticare," meaning "to chew."  The suffix "-dor" is a Spanish suffix indicating an agent or doer of an action. Therefore, "masticador" literally means "one who chews" or "chewer," but in anatomical usage, it specifically refers to the muscles involved in chewing.
