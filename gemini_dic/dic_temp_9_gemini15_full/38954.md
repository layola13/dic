词源:
The word "confidingness" derives from the adjective "confiding," which in turn comes from the verb "confide."  "Confide" ultimately traces back to the Latin word "confidere," meaning "to trust," which is composed of the prefix "con-" (together) and "fidere" (to trust). Therefore, "confidingness" essentially means the state or quality of being trusting and open.
