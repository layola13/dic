词源:

The word comes from the combination of "ham" (meaning "a clumsy person") and "fisted" (referring to the hand).  The "ham" element likely originates from the now-archaic sense of "ham" as a clumsy or awkward person, possibly connected to the idea of a ham actor's exaggerated and often clumsy gestures.  The overall meaning suggests the awkward, heavy-handed movements of someone with large, clumsy hands.
