词源:
The word "sandwiched" is derived from the noun "sandwich," which itself originated in the 18th century, named after John Montagu, the 4th Earl of Sandwich, who is said to have invented this convenient meal of meat between slices of bread to avoid interrupting his gambling.  The verb form and the adjective "sandwiched" arose later, reflecting the idea of something being placed between other elements, similar to the structure of a sandwich.
