The term "cost-out" is a compound word formed by combining "cost" and "out."  "Cost" refers to the amount of money needed to produce something, and "out" suggests the complete and thorough process of determining this amount.  Its usage likely evolved from the practice of detailed cost accounting and budgeting in business and industry.  There's no single historical event pinpointing its origin, rather its emergence reflects the increasing need for precise cost management in modern economics.
