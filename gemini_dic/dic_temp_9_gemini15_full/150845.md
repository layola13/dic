USAGE->
This word is primarily used in linguistic analysis and is not commonly used in everyday conversation.  Therefore, providing examples of tenses, voices, etc. is not applicable in the same way as for common words like "what."  The usage is primarily descriptive, to identify a specific phonetic phenomenon.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "paragogic."  The term itself describes a linguistic process rather than forming part of common expressions.
