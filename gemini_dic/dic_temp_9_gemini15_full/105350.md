词源：The term "kickback" likely originates from the idea of money being "kicked back" to someone secretly, as a form of illicit payment.  The etymology is not definitively traced to a single source, but it reflects the clandestine nature of the transaction.  The use of "kick" to imply a forceful or sudden return of something adds to the sense of illegality and underhandedness.
