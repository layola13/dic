词源:
The word "remoulder" is formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "anew") to the word "moulder," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "mouldre" (to grind or crumble).  The meaning evolved to encompass shaping and forming, especially with malleable materials like clay.  Thus, "remoulder" signifies the act of reshaping or reforming something.
