The word "enring" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.  There's no pronunciation, part of speech, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical explanations available for a non-existent word.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a word from a very specialized field, or a word from another language.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more informed response.
