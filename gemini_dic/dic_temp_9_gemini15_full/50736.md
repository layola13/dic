The word "derotremata" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or recognized scientific nomenclature.  Therefore, a complete analysis as requested is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a term from a highly specialized field not widely known.  To provide the requested analysis, I need a valid word.
