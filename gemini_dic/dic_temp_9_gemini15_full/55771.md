词源:

The word "diversifying" comes from the verb "diversify," which itself is derived from the Late Latin word "diversificare," meaning "to make diverse."  "Di" is a prefix meaning "apart" or "away," and "versificare" relates to "versare," meaning "to turn" or "to change."  Thus, the root meaning points to the act of turning or changing something into different forms or aspects.
