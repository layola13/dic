gonocalyx:/ˌɡoʊnoʊˈkeɪlɪks/ | n. | 闭合花萼；合生萼 |  A gonocalyx refers to a calyx (the sepals of a flower) in which the sepals are fused together, forming a single, united structure.  This is in contrast to a chorisis calyx where the sepals are free and separate.  The term is primarily used in botanical descriptions of plant morphology. | Example: The flower exhibited a gamosepalous gonocalyx, indicating the sepals were fused into a single unit.  闭合花萼的花显示出合生萼，表明萼片融合成一个单元。| 近义词：gamosepalous calyx, united calyx | 反义词：chorisepalous calyx, free calyx | 名词
