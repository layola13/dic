词源:

The word "overhauler" is derived from the verb "overhaul," which combines "over" (meaning completely or thoroughly) and "haul" (meaning to pull or drag).  The original sense referred to the thorough repair and maintenance of machinery, particularly ships' rigging.  The noun form, "overhaulers," simply refers to the people who perform this action.
