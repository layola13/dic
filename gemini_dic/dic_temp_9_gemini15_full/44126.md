词源:
The word "crispy" comes from the Middle English word "crisp," which meant "curled or crisp."  This, in turn, comes from the Old Norse word "krisp," which may be related to the Proto-Germanic word "*kruspa-", meaning "twisted, curled".  The modern sense of "easily crumbled or broken" developed later.
