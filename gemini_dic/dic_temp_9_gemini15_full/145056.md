词源:
The word "overalls" comes from the combination of "over" and "all."  It literally means something worn over all of one's other clothing, hence the design covering the entire body.  The term emerged in the 19th century, initially referring to protective garments worn over other clothes, then evolving to specifically denote the bib-and-strap trousers we know today.
