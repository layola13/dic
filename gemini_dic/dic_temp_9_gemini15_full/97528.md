词源:

The word "ingracious" is derived from the Old French word "ingracieux," which itself comes from the Latin "in-" (not) + "gratia" (grace, thankfulness, favour).  Therefore, it literally means "without grace" or "lacking grace."


用法说明:

Ingracious is primarily used as an adjective to describe a person's behavior or manner as unpleasant, discourteous, or lacking in charm and politeness. It emphasizes a lack of grace, kindness, and consideration for others.  It's often used to describe actions or words that are deliberately offensive or insensitive.  The word carries a stronger negative connotation than simply being "impolite."
