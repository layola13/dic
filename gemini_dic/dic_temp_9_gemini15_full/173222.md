词源:
The word is a combination of "quasi," meaning "seemingly" or "resembling," and "commandingly," the adverbial form of "commanding," which means to give an order or to have authority.  Therefore, "quasi-commandingly" describes something that has the appearance or effect of a command, but without the directness of a formal order.
