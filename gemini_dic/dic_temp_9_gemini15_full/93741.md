WORD ORIGIN->

The word "immaterialness" is derived from the adjective "immaterial" and the suffix "-ness," which forms nouns denoting a state or quality.

"Immaterial" itself comes from the prefix "im-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "material," meaning "physical" or "important."  Therefore, "immaterial" means "not physical" or "unimportant."  The suffix "-ness" transforms this adjective into a noun signifying the state of being immaterial.  The word's etymology thus traces back to Latin roots.
