英文解析:
Perfunctoriness refers to the act of doing something in a routine or mechanical way, without genuine interest or care. It implies a lack of enthusiasm, attention to detail, or effort.  It suggests that the task is performed simply to fulfill an obligation rather than out of genuine commitment or concern.


例句:

词源:

The word "perfunctoriness" derives from the adjective "perfunctory," which comes from the Latin "perfunctorius," meaning "performed as a duty."  "Per" means "through" or "thoroughly," and "functus" means "having performed." The original meaning, therefore, implied a task properly completed, but the modern meaning has shifted to emphasize the lack of enthusiasm or care involved.
