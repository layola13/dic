词源:
The word "clamour" ultimately derives from the Old French word "clamer," meaning "to shout" or "to cry out." This in turn has roots in the Latin word "clamare," with the same meaning.  The shift from a verb to a noun reflects the common linguistic process where a verb's action becomes associated with the resulting sound or state.
