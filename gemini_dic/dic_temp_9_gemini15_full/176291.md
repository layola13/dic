词源:  The word is formed by the prefix "re-" (meaning again) and the past participle "digested" of the verb "digest."  "Digest" itself comes from the Latin "digerere," meaning "to distribute, arrange, carry off," ultimately deriving from "dis-" (apart) and "gerere" (to carry).  Thus, "re-digested" literally means "carried apart again," reflecting the process of breaking down and re-processing information or food.
