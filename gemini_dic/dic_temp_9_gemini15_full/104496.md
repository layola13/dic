The word "kalan" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  To provide such an analysis, I would need a valid English word.  If you have misspelled the word or it is from a specific dialect or specialized vocabulary, please provide more context or the correct spelling.
