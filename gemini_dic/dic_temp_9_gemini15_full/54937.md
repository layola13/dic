词源:
The word "dispossessed" comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away from" or "opposite of") and the verb "possess" (meaning "to have or own").  Therefore, "dispossessed" literally means "deprived of possession."  The root of "possess" traces back to the Latin word "possidere," meaning "to sit upon" or "to occupy."
