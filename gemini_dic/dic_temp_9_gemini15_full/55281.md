The word "dislanderous" does not exist in standard English.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  The intended word is probably "scandalous" or perhaps a combination of "dis-" and another word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis as requested.  To help, please provide the correct spelling or context where you encountered this word.
