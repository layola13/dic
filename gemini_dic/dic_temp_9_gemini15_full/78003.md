词源:

gentlemanliness is derived from "gentleman" + "-liness",  "-liness" is a suffix forming nouns meaning "state or quality of being".  "Gentleman" itself has a complex history, evolving from "gentle" (meaning well-born, refined) + "man".  The evolution reflects the historical association of refined manners and honorable behavior with the upper classes.
