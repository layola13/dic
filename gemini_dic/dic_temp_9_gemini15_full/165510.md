/ˌpriːlʌɡˈʒʊəriəsnəsəz/ | n. | 过度奢侈的事物；过分豪华的享受 |  The word "preluxuriousnesses" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, likely formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before or in advance of), "luxurious" (meaning extremely comfortable and expensive), and "-nesses" (a plural suffix indicating qualities or states).  It suggests an excessive or premature indulgence in luxury. There are no established dictionaries entries or common usage.  Therefore, providing examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical usage is impossible as it lacks established meaning and usage.   The word would likely be understood contextually, based on the writer's intended meaning.
