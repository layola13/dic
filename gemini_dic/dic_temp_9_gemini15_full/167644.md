The word "price" comes from the Old French word "preis," meaning "price, value, worth."  This, in turn, is derived from the Latin word "pretium," also meaning "price, value, reward."  The evolution of the word reflects the enduring importance of assigning a value to goods and services across different cultures and time periods.
