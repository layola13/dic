词源:
The word "comportment" comes from the Old French word "comportement," which means "bearing, conduct."  The Old French word itself is derived from the verb "comporter," meaning "to bear oneself, behave."  The prefix "com-" indicates "together" or "with," while "porter" means "to carry" or "to bear."  Thus, the original meaning suggests the way one carries or presents oneself.
