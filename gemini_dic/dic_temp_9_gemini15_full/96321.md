词源:
The word "indigitate" comes from the Latin word "indigito," which means "to point out."  The prefix "in-" intensifies the meaning, while "-digito" is related to the word "digit," referring to a finger. Thus, the word literally means "to point out with a finger," hence its meaning of accusing or pointing out someone's guilt.
