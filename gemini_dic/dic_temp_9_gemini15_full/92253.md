hypervariabilities:/ˌhaɪpərvɛəriəˈbɪlətiz/| n. |高变异性，高度变异性 |The term refers to regions of the genome characterized by exceptionally high rates of mutation and polymorphism.  These regions often play a significant role in adaptation and evolution.  They are frequently found in genes related to immune response, reproduction, and other rapidly evolving functions. |Example:  The study focused on the hypervariabilities within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes.|近义词：high variability, extensive polymorphism |反义词：monomorphism, conservation
