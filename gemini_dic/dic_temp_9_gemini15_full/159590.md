The word "pollening" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need clarification:

1. **Is it a misspelling?**  If so, what word were you trying to spell?  (e.g., pollen, pollinating, pollination)

2. **Is it a newly coined word within a specific context?** If so, please provide the context (e.g., a scientific paper, a fictional work).  This will help determine its meaning and usage.


Once you provide this information, I can offer a detailed analysis similar to your example.
