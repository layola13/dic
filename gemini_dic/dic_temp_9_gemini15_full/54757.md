词源:

The word "dispatch" comes from the Old French word "despecher," meaning "to hasten," "to expedite," or "to send off quickly."  This, in turn, is derived from the Old French "pescher," meaning "to hurry" and "des-," a prefix indicating "away from" or "removal."  The word evolved through Middle English and eventually took on its current meanings.
