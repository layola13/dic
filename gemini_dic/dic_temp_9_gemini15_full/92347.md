近义词和反义词的补充说明：

近义词:  Understatement and litotes are very close synonyms, all emphasizing a point by downplaying it.  The difference is subtle; litotes specifically uses double negatives.

反义词: Hyperbole is the direct opposite; it uses exaggeration for emphasis.


词源：

From Greek *hypobole*, from *hypo- “under” + bole “throw, cast.”*  The term refers to the "underthrowing" or downplaying of the truth for rhetorical effect.
