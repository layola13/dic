词源:  Derived from "grunge," which originally referred to a style of music characterized by a raw, unpolished sound, and later extended to describe a related aesthetic of unkempt appearance and a generally messy, dirty look.  The suffix "-ier" adds a comparative meaning, indicating a higher degree of grunginess.
