词源:
The word "confusional" derives from the noun "confusion," which comes from the Latin word "confusio," meaning "a pouring together, a mingling, disorder." The suffix "-al" is added to create the adjectival form, signifying "relating to" or "characterized by."  Therefore, "confusional" means "relating to or characterized by confusion."
