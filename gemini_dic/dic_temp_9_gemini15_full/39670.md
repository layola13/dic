词源:  The word "conservatory" comes from the late Middle English word *conservatoire*, which itself is derived from the French word *conservatoire*.  The French word ultimately stems from the verb *conserver*, meaning "to preserve" or "to conserve," reflecting the original purpose of these structures – to preserve delicate plants from harsh weather.  The later use to describe a music school emerged from the idea of "preserving" and passing on musical knowledge and traditions.
