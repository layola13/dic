词源:
The word "packaging" comes from the verb "to package," which itself is derived from the earlier word "package," ultimately originating from the Old French word *pacquet, meaning "bundle" or "packet."  The suffix "-ing" transforms the verb into a noun, referring to the act or process of packaging.
