词源:

Dismiss comes from the Old French word "desmettre," which means "to put away," "to remove," or "to send away."  It is composed of the prefix "des-" (away) and the verb "mettre" (to put).  The meaning evolved over time to encompass the ideas of removing someone from a position or rejecting something as unimportant.
