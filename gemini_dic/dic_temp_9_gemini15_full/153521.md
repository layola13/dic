pentachenium:/ˌpɛntəˈkiːniəm/| n. |五价钋|Pentachenium refers to the hypothetical pentavalent cation of polonium (Po⁵⁺).  It is not a stable or readily observed species due to the high oxidation potential of polonium. The existence of pentachenium is primarily theoretical and discussed within the context of computational chemistry and theoretical studies of polonium's oxidation states.  There are no known practical applications or common usage examples.| | | | | |
