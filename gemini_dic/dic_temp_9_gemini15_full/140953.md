WORD ORIGIN->

The word "one-sidedness" is formed from "one-sided" + "-ness".  "One-sided" means having or showing only one side of an issue or situation, lacking balance or objectivity. The suffix "-ness" is a noun suffix that converts adjectives into nouns, indicating a state, quality, or condition.  Therefore, "one-sidedness" denotes the state or quality of being one-sided.
