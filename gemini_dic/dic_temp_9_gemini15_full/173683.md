词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin, meaning "as if," "seemingly," or "apparently."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation to something but not a complete identity.

* **luxuriously**: From "luxury," ultimately from Latin *luxuria*  (excessive indulgence, extravagance).  "-ously" is an adverbial suffix.

Therefore, "quasi-luxuriously" literally means "in a manner resembling or approximating luxury."
