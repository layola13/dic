词源:
The word "mistico" is ultimately derived from the Greek word "μυστικός" (mystikos), meaning "secret" or "mysterious."  It passed into Latin as "mysticu"s" and then into various Romance languages, including Spanish, from which "místico" (and its English borrowing "mistico") originates.  The suffix "-ico" is a common Spanish suffix indicating an adjective or noun related to the root word.
