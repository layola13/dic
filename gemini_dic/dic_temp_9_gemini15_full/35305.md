The word "cmes" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  Perhaps a misspelling of "comes," "seems," or a similar word? Please double-check your spelling.
* **It's a proper noun or abbreviation:** It might be a name, an acronym, or an abbreviation specific to a certain field.  More context is needed.
* **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word or a slang term not yet widely recognized.


To provide the analysis you requested, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered "cmes."
