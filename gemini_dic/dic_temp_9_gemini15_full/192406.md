词源：From "scrofula" + "-itic," a suffix indicating a disease or condition. "Scrofula" itself ultimately derives from Latin "scrofa" meaning "sow," referencing the belief that the disease was curable by the touch of a king (the "king's evil").  This belief connected the disease to pigs, hence the association with "scrofa."
