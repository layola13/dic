ethenyl:/ˈɛθɪnɪl/| n. |乙烯基|Ethenyl is a chemical group consisting of a vinyl group (CH2=CH−). It's an unsaturated hydrocarbon group derived from ethene (ethylene) by removing one hydrogen atom. It's often found in polymers and other organic compounds.| Example: Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) contains many ethenyl groups in its polymer chain.|近义词: vinyl group|反义词:  无直接反义词，但可以考虑与饱和烷基对比|名词
