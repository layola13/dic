词源：

The word "disobliging" is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the word "obliging."  "Obliging" comes from the verb "oblige," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "obliger," meaning "to bind" or "to constrain."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "obligare," which has the same meaning.  Therefore, "disobliging" literally means "not binding" or "not constrained to help," leading to its current meaning of being unwilling to help or cooperate.
