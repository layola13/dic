This word is not commonly used.  It's a relatively rare and complex word formed by combining "non-" (not), "specious" (superficially plausible, but actually wrong), and "-nesses" (a plural suffix indicating qualities or states).  Therefore, it refers to the qualities or instances of being not superficially plausible, or the lack of things that seem plausible but are actually false.

Because of its rarity, providing example sentences for various grammatical tenses is impractical.  The word functions grammatically like other plural nouns.  It would typically be used in academic or highly formal contexts.  The word itself is a very heavy and unusual word.   Most writers would avoid using it unless they are intentionally writing in a very formal and academic style.  It's better to use simpler terms to convey the same meaning.
