词源:

The word "nonindictable" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "indictable" (meaning "subject to indictment").  "Indictable" itself derives from "indictment," which comes from the Old French "enditement" (to accuse, to present a charge).  Ultimately, the root goes back to the Latin "dictare" (to say, to dictate).
