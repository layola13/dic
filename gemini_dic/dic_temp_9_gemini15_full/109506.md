lernaeacea: /ˌlɜːniˈeɪsiə/ | n. | 鲤科 | The Lernaeacea are a family of parasitic copepods.  They are commonly known as fish lice. These crustaceans are characterized by their elongated, worm-like bodies and their parasitic lifestyle on fish. They attach themselves to the gills, skin, or other parts of the fish host, feeding on the fish's blood and tissues. Different species of Lernaeacea infect various fish species, causing various degrees of harm depending on the intensity of the infestation.  The life cycle of Lernaeacea involves several developmental stages, including free-swimming larval stages that seek out suitable fish hosts. |  The parasitic copepod *Lernaea cyprinacea* infects many freshwater fish. = 寄生桡足类动物 *Lernaea cyprinacea* 感染许多淡水鱼。


The study of Lernaeacea is important for understanding fish health and managing fish populations. =  对鱼虱的研究对于了解鱼类健康和管理鱼类种群至关重要。| 近义词:  fish lice (this is a common name, not a scientific synonym) | 反义词:  (no direct antonym, as it refers to a specific taxonomic group)|  名词
