go-the-vole: /ɡoʊ ðə ˈvoʊl/ | n. | 田鼠之歌，(俚语)愚蠢的行为 |  This term is not a standard English word found in dictionaries.  It appears to be a humorous or invented phrase, possibly combining "go" (to proceed), "the" (definite article), and "vole" (a small rodent). The meaning is derived from context and likely implies an absurd or futile action, much like a vole's seemingly insignificant activities.  There is no established etymology or usage beyond potential informal or whimsical application.  Therefore, providing detailed grammatical examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., is not possible.


例句：He spent all day trying to build a tiny house for his pet hamster. It was a real go-the-vole situation.  = 他花了一整天时间试图为他的宠物仓鼠建造一个小房子。这真是件愚蠢的事。
