This word "imperialness's" is not a standard English word.  It's a grammatically incorrect construction.  It appears to be an attempt to make "imperialness" possessive, but the apostrophe-s is redundantly applied to a word already ending in -ness (which is a noun suffix).

**imperialness:**

/ɪmˈpɪəriəl.nəs/ | n. | 帝王气派；帝国主义特性；专制性 | The quality or state of being imperial;  characteristics of an empire or emperor. It suggests grandeur, power, dominance, and often authoritarianism.
