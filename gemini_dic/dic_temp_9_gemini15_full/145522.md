词源:  The word "overcoloration" is a compound word. It combines the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the noun "coloration" (referring to the arrangement or application of colors). "Coloration" itself comes from the word "color," ultimately deriving from Old French "color" and Latin "color," meaning "color, appearance."
