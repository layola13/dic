USAGE->
This word is relatively rare and doesn't readily lend itself to the typical grammatical structures shown in the example.  It's primarily used in academic discussions of linguistics and historical analysis.  Therefore, providing examples for all tenses and voices would be artificial and misleading.  The word is best understood within the context of its definition.


PHRASE->
There are no common or idiomatic phrases using "diachronicnesses".  The word itself is highly specialized.
