retro-fire:/ˈrɛtroʊfaɪər/| v. |反向点火；逆向点火|To ignite or fire a rocket engine in the opposite direction of intended travel, typically for course correction or a controlled descent.|例句：The spacecraft will retro-fire its engines to slow its descent and achieve a soft landing.  航天器将反向点火以减缓下降速度并实现软着陆。
例句：The pilot retro-fired the rockets to adjust the trajectory of the missile. 飞行员反向点火以调整导弹的轨迹。|近义词：reverse thrust, counter-thrust|反义词：ignite, propel


USAGE->
