词源:
The word "mug" in the sense of "stupid person" dates back to the early 19th century. Its etymology is uncertain, but it's possibly related to earlier uses of "mug" meaning "face" or "mouth," suggesting a connection to a person's expression or appearance.  Another theory suggests a connection to the word "mugs" referring to a type of drinking vessel, implying someone who drinks heavily or is easily intoxicated.  The exact origin remains debated.
