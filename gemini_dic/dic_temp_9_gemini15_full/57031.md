Etymology:

The term "doublespeak" was coined by William Lutz, an American professor of English, who popularized its use in his writings on language and political rhetoric.  While the concept of deceptive language has existed for centuries, Lutz's work in the late 20th century solidified "doublespeak" as a widely understood term.  It's a blend of "double" (meaning two) and "speak" (referring to language), highlighting the deceptive nature of using two seemingly contradictory meanings simultaneously.
