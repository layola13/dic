The word "cakeyest" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a very niche context.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need clarification:

1. **Is this word a misspelling?** If so, what do you think it should be?  Knowing the intended word will allow me to provide the analysis you requested.

2. **Is it a neologism?** If so, from what context does it originate?  Knowing the context will help determine its intended meaning and potential usage.


Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis.
