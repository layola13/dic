词源:
The word "decimate" originates from the Latin word "decimāre," which literally means "to take a tenth." In ancient Rome, decimation was a military punishment where one tenth of the soldiers in a unit were executed as punishment for mutiny or defeat.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass the broader sense of greatly reducing or destroying a large portion of something, even if it's not exactly one tenth.
