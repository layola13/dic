词源:

The word "mentalize" is a relatively modern coinage, derived from the adjective "mental" (meaning relating to the mind) and the suffix "-ize," which creates verbs signifying "to make or become."  Therefore, "mentalize" essentially means "to make mental" or "to process mentally."  Its usage is primarily within the fields of psychology and cognitive science.
