scillitin:/ˈsɪlɪtɪn/| n.|西里替林|Scilliroside, also known as scilliroside, is a cardiotonic glycoside found in the squill plant (Urginea maritima). It is a potent cardiac stimulant and has been used in traditional medicine for treating heart conditions. However, due to its narrow therapeutic index and potential toxicity, its use is limited and requires careful monitoring.|The scilliroside content in squill bulbs varies widely depending on the growing conditions and the time of harvest. This makes standardization of preparations challenging.|Example:  Research on scilliroside's cardiotonic effects continues to reveal its complex mechanism of action. = 对西里替林强心作用的研究仍在揭示其复杂的机制。|近义词:  (lacks close synonyms due to its specific chemical nature)|反义词: (lacks direct antonyms)|名词
