dasypaedic: /ˌdæzɪˈpiːdɪk/ | adj. | 缓慢的；迟缓的；行动迟钝的 |  Relating to or characterized by slowness or sluggishness of movement.  The word suggests a lack of energy or a difficulty in moving quickly. |


The word "dasypaedic" is not commonly used in modern English.  Its use is largely confined to specialized contexts or literary works aiming for a particular effect (e.g., evoking a sense of ancient or archaic style).  There are no readily available examples of its usage in everyday conversation or contemporary writing.


Etymology: The word is formed from the Greek elements:

*  "dasys" (δασεύς) meaning "hairy," "rough," or "thick."  This element contributes to the sense of slowness or impeded movement.
* "paidion" (παιδίον) meaning "child," although in this context, it's likely contributing to the overall sense of immaturity or underdeveloped state, which might be linked to a lack of physical dexterity.

The combination implies a state of being slow or sluggish, perhaps associated with a physical impediment or a general lack of agility.  The precise etymological connection to "slowness" is not directly apparent in the individual Greek words, but the overall constructed meaning of the word seems to have evolved in that direction.
