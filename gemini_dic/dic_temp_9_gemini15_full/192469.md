词源:  The word "scrummage" likely originated in the late 19th century, connected to the rugby term "scrum," which describes a tightly packed formation of players. The sense of a chaotic, forceful pushing and shoving in a scrum likely contributed to the development of the verb "scrummage" to describe a similar kind of energetic, somewhat disorganized searching.
