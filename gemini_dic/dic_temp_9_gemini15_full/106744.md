l-glucose: /ˈɛl ˈɡluːkoʊs/ | n. | L-葡萄糖 | L-glucose is a type of glucose, a simple sugar, that is the mirror image of the more common D-glucose.  It's a stereoisomer of D-glucose, differing only in the spatial arrangement of atoms around one carbon atom.  It is less common in nature and does not play a significant role in biological metabolism in most organisms. | Example:  The research focused on the enzymatic synthesis of L-glucose from readily available substrates.  研究重点是利用易得的底物酶促合成L-葡萄糖。 | 近义词: L-glucopyranose | 反义词: D-glucose
