The word "semih" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?

2. **A name:** It might be a name of Turkish origin.  In Turkish, "semih" (pronounced roughly as /seˈmiːx/) means "noble," "generous," or "high-minded."  If this is the case, it functions as a proper noun and doesn't have grammatical properties like other parts of speech.

3. **A word from another language:** It could be a word from a language other than English.  Please provide more context if possible so I can help you find the correct meaning and usage.


Without further information, I cannot provide the requested analysis following the format you specified.  Please clarify the word's origin and context.
