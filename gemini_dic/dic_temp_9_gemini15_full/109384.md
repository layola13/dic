lenticel:/ˈlɛntɪsɛl/| n. |皮孔；透气孔|A lenticel is a small pore, typically elongated, in the bark of woody plants, that allows gas exchange between the atmosphere and the internal tissues.  Lenticels are usually visible as slightly raised, porous areas on the surface of stems and branches. They are essential for respiration in the plant, allowing oxygen to enter and carbon dioxide to escape.|Example: The lenticels on the apple's skin were clearly visible.|近义词：pore, stoma|反义词：无


USAGE->

We observed the lenticels on the tree bark. = 我们观察了树皮上的皮孔。


现在完成时:
Researchers have studied the function of lenticels for decades. = 研究人员几十年来一直在研究皮孔的功能。
The damage to the lenticels has affected the plant's health. = 皮孔的损伤影响了植物的健康。


过去完成时:
The lenticels had already begun to form before the leaves fell. = 叶子落下之前，皮孔就已经开始形成了。
Scientists had discovered the importance of lenticels long ago. = 科学家很久以前就发现了皮孔的重要性。


将来时:
We will study the lenticels in detail next week. = 我们下周将详细研究皮孔。
The experiment will show the role of lenticels in plant growth. = 实验将显示皮孔在植物生长中的作用。


虚拟语气:
If the lenticels were blocked, the plant would suffocate. = 如果皮孔被堵塞，植物就会窒息。

The function of lenticels is still being researched. = 皮孔的功能仍在研究中。


疑问句:
What is the function of lenticels? = 皮孔的功能是什么？
How do lenticels help plants breathe? = 皮孔如何帮助植物呼吸？


否定句:
The plant did not have any visible lenticels. = 植物没有可见的皮孔。
The experiment did not show any significant effects on the lenticels. = 实验没有显示对皮孔的任何显著影响。
