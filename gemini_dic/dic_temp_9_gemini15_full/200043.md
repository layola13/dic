词源：

The word "skeptical" originates from the Greek word "skeptikos," meaning "inquiring," "investigative," or "doubting."  This, in turn, is derived from the verb "sképtesthai," meaning "to consider," "to examine," or "to look about."  The Greek Skeptics were a philosophical school who emphasized the importance of questioning and examining beliefs rather than accepting them unquestioningly.


用法说明：

skeptical通常作形容词使用，可以修饰人或其态度、观点等。  它通常表示对某事或某人的真实性、有效性或可靠性持有怀疑。


以下是一些skeptical在不同语境中的例句，以进一步说明其用法：


1.  The scientist approached the new theory with a skeptical eye. = 科学家以怀疑的眼光看待这个新理论。
2.  Many people are skeptical of government statistics. = 许多人对政府统计数据持怀疑态度。
3.  Her skeptical tone made it clear she didn't believe his story. = 她怀疑的语气清楚地表明她不相信他的话。
4.  I'm skeptical that the project will be completed on time. = 我怀疑这个项目能否按时完成。
5.  He listened to the salesman’s pitch with a skeptical expression. = 他带着怀疑的表情听着推销员的推销。


需要注意的是，“skeptical”并不一定意味着完全否定或不相信，而更倾向于表示一种谨慎的、需要更多证据的态度。  它是一种理性的怀疑，而不是盲目的否定。
