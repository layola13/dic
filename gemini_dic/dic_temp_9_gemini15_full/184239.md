The word "resolvableness" is derived from the verb "resolve," ultimately tracing back to the Latin word "resolvere," which means "to loosen, untie, dissolve, solve."  The suffix "-able" indicates capability or possibility.  Therefore, "resolvableness" signifies the quality of being capable of being resolved or solved.
