Etymology:

The word "cogenial" comes from the Middle English word "congenial," which itself is derived from the Late Latin word "congenialis."  "Con-" is a prefix meaning "together" or "with," and "-genialis" is related to the Latin word "genus," meaning "kind," "race," or "birth." Thus, the root meaning points to a shared nature or origin, leading to the sense of compatibility and pleasant agreement.
