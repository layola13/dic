词源:
The word "cuttlefish" comes from "cuttle" + "fish".  "Cuttle" is derived from the Old English word "cudele," which ultimately comes from a Proto-Germanic root related to the idea of cutting or splitting.  This may refer to the way the cuttlebone can be broken apart or perhaps to the way the cuttlefish cuts through the water.  The addition of "fish" simply clarifies that this is a type of fish-like creature.
