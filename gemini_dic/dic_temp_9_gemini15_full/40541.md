词源:
From "controversy" + "-alist".  "Controversy" comes from the Old French "controversie," ultimately from the Latin "controversia," meaning "dispute," from "controvertere," to turn against, oppose. "-alist" is a suffix forming nouns denoting a person who practices or is an expert in a specified activity or field.
