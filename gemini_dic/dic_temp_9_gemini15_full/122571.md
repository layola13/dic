词源:
From Middle French *moderation, from Latin moderatio, from moderāre "to restrain, regulate, keep within bounds," from modus "measure, manner, limit."  The sense evolution shows a progression from the literal act of regulating or controlling something to the figurative sense of self-control and restraint.
