词源:
The word "infiltrator" is derived from the verb "infiltrate," which comes from the Latin "infiltrare," meaning "to filter in" or "to soak through."  The prefix "in-" means "into," and "filtrare" is related to "filtrum," meaning "filter."  Thus, the original meaning implied a gradual permeation or seepage.  The modern usage extends this to the secret entry of a person or thing into a place or organization.
