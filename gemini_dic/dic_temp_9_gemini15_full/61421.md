词源:
The word "emboldener" is derived from the verb "embolden," which itself comes from the Old French word "enboldir," meaning "to make bold."  The prefix "en-" means "in" or "into," and "boldir" is related to the Old French word "bold," meaning "brave" or "courageous."  Therefore, "embolden" ultimately traces back to the concept of "making brave" or "giving courage."
