词源:

Discordable derives from the verb "discord," meaning to be in disagreement or conflict.  The suffix "-able" signifies "capable of being" or "worthy of being." Therefore, "discordable" literally means "capable of being in discord" or "likely to cause discord."  The word's roots trace back to Old French "discorde" and ultimately to the Latin "discordia," meaning "disagreement" or "strife."
