词源:
The word "insignificant" is derived from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "significant," which comes from the Latin word "significans," meaning "making a sign" or "expressing meaning."  Therefore, insignificant literally means "not making a sign" or "not expressing meaning," thus implying lack of importance.
