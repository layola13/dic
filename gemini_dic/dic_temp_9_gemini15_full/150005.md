The word "palmitolic" is derived from "palmitic" (referring to palm oil) and the suffix "-olic," which is used to form adjectives related to organic compounds, particularly fatty acids.  "Palmitic" itself comes from the Latin word "palma," meaning "palm tree," reflecting the origin of palmitic acid from palm oil.
