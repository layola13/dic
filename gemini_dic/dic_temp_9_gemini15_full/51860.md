dextroglucoses: /ˌdɛkˈstroʊˈɡluːkoʊsiːz/ | n. | 右旋葡萄糖（复数） | Dextrose,  a form of glucose, is a simple sugar that is found naturally in fruits and honey.  The term "dextrose" refers to the fact that it rotates plane-polarized light to the right (dextrorotatory).  "Dextroglucoses" is the plural form, referring to multiple instances of this sugar. | The solution contained high concentrations of dextroglucoses.  该溶液含有高浓度的右旋葡萄糖。  The experiment measured the effects of different concentrations of dextroglucoses on enzyme activity.  该实验测量了不同浓度的右旋葡萄糖对酶活性的影响。 | glucose, dextrose | levulose | noun
