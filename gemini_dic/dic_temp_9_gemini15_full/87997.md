词源:

The term "high-resolution" is a compound adjective.  "High" signifies a superior level or degree. "Resolution" comes from the Latin word "resolvere," meaning "to loosen, untie, solve," and in the context of imaging, refers to the clarity and detail of an image, determined by the number of pixels.  Therefore, "high-resolution" literally means a high degree of image clarity and detail.
