scintillation: /ˌsɪntɪˈleɪʃən/| n. |闪烁；闪光；闪烁现象 |The emission of light from a substance, especially as a result of bombardment by ionizing radiation.  It often refers to the tiny flashes of light produced by individual particles or photons interacting with a material.  |例句：The night sky was alive with the scintillation of countless stars. 夜空因无数星星的闪烁而充满生机。

The scintillation detector registered a high count rate, indicating a significant radiation source. 闪烁探测器记录到高计数率，表明存在重要的辐射源。|近义词：twinkling, glimmering, sparkling, flashing |反义词：dullness, darkness
