Etymology:

The word "rosebush" is a compound word formed from "rose" and "bush".

* **Rose:**  Originates from Old French *rose*, ultimately from Latin *rosa*.  The Latin word has cognates in many other Indo-European languages, indicating a very ancient word with roots in Proto-Indo-European.

* **Bush:**  Comes from Middle English *busk*, possibly from Old Norse *buskr* or Old French *bosc* (meaning "wood," "forest").  The meaning evolved to denote a low, shrubby plant.
