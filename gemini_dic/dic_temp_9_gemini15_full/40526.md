词源:
The word "controllership" is derived from the word "controller," which itself comes from the Old French word "contrôleur," meaning "examiner," "checker," or "supervisor."  The "-ship" suffix indicates a state, condition, office, or function.  Therefore, "controllership" signifies the office, function, or state of being a controller.
