/ˈkoʊpəlɪsnəsɪz/ | n. | 无应对能力的状态；缺乏应付能力的各种情况 | The copelessnesses of the situation were overwhelming.  | 近义词：helplessness, powerlessness, inability | 反义词：capability, competence


This word is not found in standard English dictionaries. It appears to be a nonce word, meaning it's a word coined for a specific occasion and not in common usage.  It's formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" (indicating a plural of abstract qualities) to "copeless," which itself is not a standard English word.  "Copeless" would logically mean "without coping mechanisms" or "unable to cope."  Therefore, "copelessnesses" would refer to multiple instances or aspects of this lack of coping ability.


Because it's a nonce word, there are no standard grammatical usages or example sentences from established literature.  Any usage would depend on the context in which the word was created.  A hypothetical example based on its probable meaning follows:


例句：The myriad copelessnesses of the refugee camp were evident in the despairing faces of the inhabitants. = 难民营中各种各样的无应对能力的状态在居民绝望的脸上显而易见。
