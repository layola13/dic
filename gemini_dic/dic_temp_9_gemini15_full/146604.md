The word "overgrievousness" is formed by combining:

* **over-**:  A prefix indicating "too much," "excessive," or "beyond."
* **grievous**:  An adjective meaning "causing grief or sorrow; serious; distressing."  This word itself derives from Old French *grievous*, from *griever* "to grieve," ultimately from Latin *gravis* "heavy."
* **-ness**: A suffix forming nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.

Therefore, "overgrievousness" literally means the state or condition of being excessively grieved or sorrowful.
