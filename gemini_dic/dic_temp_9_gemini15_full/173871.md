词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."

* **rebelliously**: From "rebellious," derived from the verb "rebel," ultimately from Old French *rebele* and Latin *rebellāre*, meaning "to wage war again," "to revolt."  The "-ously" suffix indicates a manner or way of being.

Therefore, "quasi-rebelliously" combines the idea of "almost" or "seemingly" with the act of rebelling, describing an action or attitude that only partially or subtly reflects rebellion.
