colliquefaction: /ˌkɒlɪkwɪˈfækʃən/ | /ˌkɑːlɪkwɪˈfækʃən/ | n. |液化；熔化；溶解|The process of transforming a solid or semi-solid substance into a liquid state, often through the application of heat or pressure.  This term is often used in geology to describe the transformation of soil from a solid to a liquid state due to seismic activity.|例句：The intense heat caused the colliquefaction of the rock.剧烈的热量导致了岩石的液化。 The earthquake led to widespread colliquefaction of the ground, causing buildings to collapse. 地震导致了大范围的地面液化，导致建筑物倒塌。|近义词：liquefaction, melting, fusion|反义词：solidification, freezing

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The intense heat causes the colliquefaction of the rock. = 剧烈的热量导致了岩石的液化。
Colliquefaction often occurs during volcanic eruptions. = 火山爆发时经常发生液化现象。

一般过去时:
