词源:

The phrasal verb "go out with" evolved from the more general meaning of "go out," which implies leaving one's home or place of residence to engage in social activities.  The addition of "with" specifies that this activity involves another person, and the context of dating or romantic involvement became the dominant usage over time.  The meaning developed naturally from the social context of leaving the house together for dates or other social encounters.
