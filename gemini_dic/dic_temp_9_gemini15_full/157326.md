词源:
The word "pioneer" comes from the French word "pionnier," meaning "foot soldier who clears paths."  Ultimately, it derives from the Latin word "pedo," meaning "foot."  The original meaning reflects the role of pioneers in clearing the way for others to follow, whether literally clearing a path through a forest or figuratively clearing a path in a new field of endeavor.
