The word "hormonic" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no such word with established meaning, pronunciation, or usage.  Therefore, a detailed analysis following your requested format is impossible.  It's possible there's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized field.  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
