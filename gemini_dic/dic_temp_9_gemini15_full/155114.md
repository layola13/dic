词源:  The word is a combination of "petrous" (from Latin *petra*, meaning "rock," referring to the hard, rocky nature of the temporal bone's petrous portion) and "mastoid" (from Greek *mastos*, meaning "breast," referring to the breast-like shape of the mastoid process).  Therefore, petromastoid literally means "relating to the rock-like and breast-like structures" of the temporal bone.
