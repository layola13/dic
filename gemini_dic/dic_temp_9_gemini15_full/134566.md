nonlocal:/ˈnɒnˈləʊkəl/| adj.| 非局部的；非本地的 | Relating to or denoting a variable in a nested function that is not local to that function but is in an enclosing function.  It indicates that the variable is not defined within the current function's scope but in a lexically enclosing function. | Example:  The `nonlocal` keyword in Python allows modification of a variable in an outer function's scope from within a nested function.

```python
def outer_function():
    x = 10
    def inner_function():
        nonlocal x  # Access and modify x from the outer function
        x = 20
    inner_function()
    print(x)  # Output: 20
```

This code demonstrates a `nonlocal` variable in Python.  Without `nonlocal`, modifying `x` inside `inner_function` would create a new local variable, leaving `x` in `outer_function` unchanged.
