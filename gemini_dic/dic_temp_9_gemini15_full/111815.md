logarithms:/ˈlɒɡərɪð(ə)mz/| n. |对数；对数表| Logarithms are mathematical functions that can simplify complex calculations by converting multiplication and division into addition and subtraction. They are based on the concept of exponents.  For example, the logarithm base 10 of 100 is 2, because 10 raised to the power of 2 equals 100.  Logarithms are widely used in various fields, including science, engineering, and finance. | Example:  The scientist used logarithms to calculate the intensity of the earthquake. 科学家用对数来计算地震的强度。

The use of logarithms significantly reduced the time needed for complex calculations before the advent of computers.  使用对数在电脑出现之前极大地减少了复杂计算所需的时间。|近义词：exponent (in a mathematical context)|反义词：无

词源:
The word "logarithm" is derived from two Greek words:  "logos" (λόγος), meaning "ratio" or "proportion," and "arithmos" (ἀριθμός), meaning "number."  John Napier, a Scottish mathematician, coined the term in the early 17th century.  The concept was developed to simplify complex calculations involving large numbers.
