词源:
From Middle English *recorden, from Old French recorder (“to record, to recite, to recount”), from Vulgar Latin *recordare (“to remember, to recall”), from Latin recordari (“to remember, to recall”). The noun use is from the 14th century.  The sense of "phonograph record" developed in the late 19th century.
