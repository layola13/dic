词源:
The term "self-expansion" is a relatively modern coinage, combining the prefix "self-" (referring to oneself) with the noun "expansion" (meaning the process of increasing in size, scope, or importance).  Its roots trace back to the broader concepts of self-perception and personal growth, which have been explored in philosophy and psychology for centuries.  The formal use of "self-expansion" as a psychological term likely emerged in the late 20th century with the rise of research on self-concept and identity.

用法说明:
