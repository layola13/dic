词源:
The term "gerrymandering" is a portmanteau of "Gerry" and "salamander."  It originated in 1812 when Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry signed a bill redrawing the state's electoral districts.  The resulting map of one district resembled a salamander, prompting a political cartoon that coined the term.  "Gerry" was a nickname for Governor Gerry, and "mander" was added to create a word resembling "salamander."
