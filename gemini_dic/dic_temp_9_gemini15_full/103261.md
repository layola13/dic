词源:  The word "jewfish" originated in the early 19th century. While its exact etymology is debated, it likely arose from a combination of factors.  One theory suggests that it was a corruption of "Jew's fish," possibly referring to its large size or the fact that it was sometimes sold by Jewish merchants.  Another theory links it to the mistaken belief that the fish was kosher. However, regardless of its origin, the term's association with antisemitic stereotypes and slurs renders it highly offensive.  The use of this term should be avoided completely.  Modern usage favors alternative names like grouper.
