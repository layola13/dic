词源:
The word "offend" comes from the Old French word "offendre," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "offendere," meaning "to strike against, to attack, to stumble against."  The sense of causing offense evolved from the literal meaning of physical striking to a metaphorical sense of striking against someone's feelings or sensibilities.
