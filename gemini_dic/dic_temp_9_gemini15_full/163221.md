precompulsions: /ˌpriːkəmˈpʌlʒənz/ | n. | 预先强迫行为；先兆性强迫行为 |  The term "precompulsions" refers to behaviors or rituals performed before a compulsive act, often to reduce anxiety or manage the urge to perform the compulsive act itself.

They represent a stage in the compulsive cycle leading up to the main compulsion. |  He engaged in precompulsions, meticulously arranging his desk before starting his work, a ritual designed to quell his anxiety about making a mistake. 他从事预先强迫行为，在开始工作之前一丝不苟地整理他的办公桌，这是一种旨在消除他对犯错焦虑的仪式。
