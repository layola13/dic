词源:

The word "proportionality" is derived from the Latin word "proportio," meaning "proportion," which itself combines "pro" (for, in favor of) and "portio" (part, share).  The suffix "-ality" indicates a quality or state.  Therefore, proportionality signifies the quality or state of being proportionate.
