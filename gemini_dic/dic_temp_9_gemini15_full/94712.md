词源:

The word "improperia" is derived from the Late Latin word "improperium," which itself comes from the classical Latin "improperare," meaning "to reproach," "to upbraid," or "to insult."  The Latin prefix "im-" implies "into" or "against," while "properare" is related to "propero," meaning "to hasten" or "to hurry"—suggesting a swift and forceful attack with words.  The evolution reflects a shift from the action of reproaching to the reproach itself, resulting in the noun "improperia."
