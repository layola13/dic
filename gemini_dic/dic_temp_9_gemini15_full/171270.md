pteropoda: /ˈtɛrəpɒdə/ | n. | 翼足类 |  Marine gastropod mollusks that have developed swimming appendages resembling wings.  They are a diverse group found in both pelagic and benthic environments, known for their unique locomotion and ecological roles.  | 例句：The pteropods are an important part of the marine food web.  翼足类是海洋食物网的重要组成部分。


The study focused on the impact of ocean acidification on pteropod shells.  这项研究的重点是大洋酸化对翼足类贝壳的影响。 | 近义词：sea butterfly (informal) | 反义词： N/A
