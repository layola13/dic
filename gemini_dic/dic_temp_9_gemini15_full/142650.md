词源:
The word "ostracize" comes from the ancient Greek practice of ostracism, where citizens could vote to banish a person from the city-state for a period of time.  This was done by writing the person's name on a shard of pottery (an ostracon).  The word thus derives from the Greek word ὀστρακισμός (ostrakismos), meaning "ostracism," which in turn comes from ὄστρακον (ostrakon), meaning "potsherd" or "shell."
