词源:

The word "ineffectualness" is derived from the adjective "ineffectual," which itself comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the adjective "effectual" (meaning "having the desired effect"), and the suffix "-ness" (forming nouns of state or quality).  "Effectual" ultimately traces back to the Latin word "effectus," the past participle of "efficere," meaning "to bring about, accomplish."
