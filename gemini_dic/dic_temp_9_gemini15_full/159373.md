词源:
The word "pokier" is the comparative form of the adjective "poky," meaning slow, cramped, or dull.  While the connection isn't immediately obvious,  the evolution likely stems from the idea that someone who is overly inquisitive or meddlesome is often perceived as slow-witted or interfering in a way that's considered bothersome and intrusive, similar to the negative connotations of "poky."  The transition in meaning is a semantic shift.
