USAGE->
This word, being a relatively rare and specialized term, doesn't lend itself to standard grammatical tense examples. Its usage is primarily within discussions of linguistics, rhetoric, and literature.

Example 1 (Simple Sentence): The comedian's use of heterophemy in his routine was highly effective.  = 喜剧演员在节目中使用异音异义词非常有效。

Example 2 (More Complex Sentence):  Analysis of the poem reveals a skillful deployment of heterophemy, creating layers of meaning and ambiguity. = 对这首诗的分析揭示了巧妙的异音异义词的使用，创造了多层含义和歧义。


PHRASE->
Because heterophemy itself is a phrase describing a linguistic phenomenon, it doesn't have common phrasal combinations in the same way as common words.  Instead, examples would be phrases *containing* heterophemy:

Example 1:  "He's a *mean* machine." (using "mean" to mean both "unkind" and "exceptionally good") = 他是一台“厉害”的机器。

Example 2: "That's a *bad* joke." (using "bad" to mean both "unpleasant" and "excellent") =  那是个“好”笑话。

Example 3:  "A *right* royal mess" (using "right" to mean both "correct" and "very") = 一团糟

Example 4: "Time heals all *wounds*." (using "wounds" to mean both physical injuries and emotional hurts) = 时间治愈一切创伤。

Example 5: "Playing it *cool*." (using "cool" to mean both temperature and calm/unfazed) = 保持冷静。
