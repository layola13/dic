词源:
The word "dispositionally" is derived from the noun "disposition," which comes from the Old French word "disposicioun," meaning "arrangement, order, inclination."  This, in turn, traces back to the Latin word "dispositio,"  combining "dis-" (apart) and "ponere" (to place). The "-ally" suffix transforms the noun into an adverb, indicating a manner or way.
