porosity:/pɔːˈrɒsɪti/| n. |孔隙率，多孔性 |The porosity of a material refers to the amount of empty space within it, expressed as a percentage of the total volume.  It's crucial in various fields, affecting properties like permeability and strength.  For example, high porosity in soil allows for better water drainage, while high porosity in a building material might reduce its strength. | The sandstone's high porosity allowed for significant groundwater storage.  这砂岩的高孔隙率允许大量的地下水储存。 The low porosity of the clay made it unsuitable for drainage.  粘土的低孔隙率使其不适合排水。 | permeability, perviousness | impermeability, density |
