granulite:/ˈɡrænjʊlaɪt/| n.|麻粒岩|A high-grade metamorphic rock formed under high temperature and pressure conditions. It is characterized by its granular texture and typically contains minerals such as garnet, pyroxene, and feldspar.| 例句：The geologist identified the sample as a granulite facies rock. 地质学家将样本鉴定为麻粒岩相岩石。|近义词：gneiss, schist|反义词: none
