词源:
The word "enjoin" comes from the Old French "enjoindre," which itself derives from the Latin "injungere."  "In-" is a prefix meaning "in" or "into," and "jungere" means "to join" or "to yoke."  Therefore, the original meaning implied "to join in," "to unite," or "to bind." Over time, the meaning evolved to the current sense of commanding or ordering.
