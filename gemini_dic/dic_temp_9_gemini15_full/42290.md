词源:
The word "counter-indicate" is a compound word formed from the prefix "counter-" (meaning "against" or "opposite") and the verb "indicate" (meaning "to point out" or "to suggest").  Therefore, it literally means "to indicate against" or "to suggest the opposite of."  Its medical usage developed from this literal meaning.
