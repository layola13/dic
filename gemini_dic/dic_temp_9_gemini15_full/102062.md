isomorph:/ˈaɪsəmɔːrf/ | n. | 同形体；同构体 |  A structure or system that has the same form as another, especially one in a different medium or context.  An isomorph is a one-to-one correspondence between two mathematical structures of the same type that preserves the relationships between the elements.  | Example: The two graphs are isomorphic because they have the same number of vertices and edges, and the connections between the vertices are identical. 这两张图是同构的，因为它们具有相同数量的顶点和边，并且顶点之间的连接是相同的。 |近义词：analogue, equivalent | 反义词：heteromorph


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The chemical structures are isomorphic. = 这些化学结构是同构的。
This graph is isomorphic to that one. = 这个图与那个图同构。


一般过去时:
The researchers found the two systems were isomorphic. = 研究人员发现这两个系统是同构的。
The proof demonstrated that the groups were isomorphic. = 证明表明这些群是同构的。


现在完成时:
We have shown that the two models are isomorphic. = 我们已经证明这两个模型是同构的。
Mathematicians have discovered many isomorphic structures. = 数学家们已经发现了许多同构结构。


过去完成时:
They had already determined that the structures were isomorphic before the presentation. = 他们在演示之前就已经确定这些结构是同构的了。
Scientists had previously found an isomorphic relationship between the two phenomena. = 科学家们之前已经发现了这两种现象之间存在同构关系。


将来时:
We will prove that these two systems are isomorphic. = 我们将证明这两个系统是同构的。
Future research will explore the isomorphic properties of these networks. = 未来的研究将探索这些网络的同构特性。


虚拟语气:
If the structures were isomorphic, the theorem would hold. = 如果结构是同构的，那么定理就会成立。
I wish I knew whether these groups were isomorphic. = 我真希望知道这些群是否是同构的。


被动语态:

The relationship was found to be isomorphic. = 发现这种关系是同构的。


疑问句:
Are the two graphs isomorphic? = 这两张图是同构的吗？
Is this structure isomorphic to that one? = 这个结构与那个结构同构吗？


否定句:
The two structures are not isomorphic. = 这两个结构不是同构的。
The mapping is not an isomorphism. = 这个映射不是同构。
