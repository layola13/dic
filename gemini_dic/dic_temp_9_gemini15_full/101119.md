invertin:/ɪnˈvɜːrtɪn/| n. |转化酶|Invertase is an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose. 转化酶是一种催化蔗糖水解成葡萄糖和果糖的酶。|近义词：sucrase, β-fructofuranosidase|反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Invertase breaks down sucrose. = 转化酶分解蔗糖。
The enzyme inverts sucrose into glucose and fructose. = 这种酶将蔗糖转化为葡萄糖和果糖。


一般过去时:
The experiment inverted the sucrose successfully. = 实验成功地转化了蔗糖。
The scientist studied how invertase inverted the sugar. = 科学家研究了转化酶如何转化糖。


现在完成时:
Scientists have used invertase for many years. = 科学家们已经使用转化酶多年了。
The company has successfully produced a new type of invertase. = 公司成功地生产了一种新型转化酶。


过去完成时:
They had already added invertase before the reaction started. = 反应开始前他们已经添加了转化酶。
The researchers had discovered a novel invertase before the publication. = 研究人员在发表论文之前已经发现了一种新型转化酶。


将来时:
We will use invertase in our next experiment. = 我们将在下一次实验中使用转化酶。
The industry will likely use more invertase in the future. = 未来该行业可能会使用更多的转化酶。


虚拟语气:
If we had more invertase, the reaction would be faster. = 如果我们有更多的转化酶，反应就会更快。
I wish we had known about this type of invertase earlier. = 我希望我们早点知道这种转化酶。


被动语态:
Sucrose is inverted by invertase. = 蔗糖被转化酶转化。
A new type of invertase is being developed. = 一种新型转化酶正在研发中。


疑问句:
What type of invertase are you using? = 你在使用哪种转化酶？
Does invertase work at low temperatures? = 转化酶在低温下有效吗？


否定句:
The reaction did not proceed because we didn't add enough invertase. = 反应没有进行，因为我们没有添加足够的转化酶。
This enzyme is not invertase; it's something else. = 这种酶不是转化酶；它是其他的东西。


PHRASE->
invertase activity = 转化酶活性
invertase production = 转化酶生产
invertase assay = 转化酶测定
invertase stability = 转化酶稳定性
invertase enzyme = 转化酶
