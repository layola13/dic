词源:  The word "butterer" derives from the verb "to butter," meaning to flatter or praise excessively. This usage is figurative, drawing a parallel between smoothly applying butter and smoothly applying praise to gain favor.  The original meaning of "butter" relates to the dairy product, and the figurative extension reflects the smoothness and often insincere nature of flattery.
