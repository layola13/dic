词源:
The word "cockbill" originates from the Old English word "cocc," meaning "cock," referring to a rooster.  The term likely derives from the way a rooster holds its head proudly, at an angle. The "-bill" suffix likely refers to a beak or projecting part, emphasizing the angled posture.  The nautical use likely evolved from the similar angled appearance of a sail set at an angle.
