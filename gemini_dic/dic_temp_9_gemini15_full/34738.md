client-server:/ˈklaɪənt ˈsɜːrvər/ | n. | 客户端-服务器 | A client-server model is a distributed application structure that partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients.  Clients request services from servers, and servers respond to those requests. This architecture is the basis for many internet applications and services. | Example:  Email uses a client-server architecture, where your email client (like Outlook or Gmail) is the client, and the email server is where your emails are stored and managed.  Many online games also rely on client-server architecture for multiplayer functionality. |近义词：distributed system, peer-to-peer (in contrast) |反义词：peer-to-peer
