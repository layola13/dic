methylation pattern = 甲基化模式


词源:
The word "methylate" comes from "methyl," referring to the methyl group (CH3), combined with the suffix "-ate," indicating a process or action.  "Methyl" itself originates from "methane" (甲烷), a simple hydrocarbon, and the suffix "-yl" used to form names of radicals.
