inertias:/ɪˈnɜːrʃəz/ | n. |惯性，惰性，阻力 |The property of a body to remain at rest or to continue in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force.  Inertia is a fundamental concept in physics, explaining why objects resist changes in their state of motion. |例句：The car's inertia kept it moving even after the brakes were applied. 这辆车的惯性使其即使在刹车后仍然继续运动。

例句：Overcoming the inertia of the bureaucracy proved to be a significant challenge. 克服官僚机构的惰性证明是一个巨大的挑战。
