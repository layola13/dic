词源:

The word "nonsolvent" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "solvent," which means "able to pay one's debts."  "Solvent" itself derives from the Latin word "solvere," meaning "to loosen, untie, solve, pay."  Therefore, "nonsolvent" literally means "not able to pay debts."
