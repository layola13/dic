consonantlike: /ˈkɒnsənəntlaɪk/ | adj. | 类似辅音的 | Resembling a consonant in sound or quality.  This term is often used in phonetics and phonology to describe sounds that share characteristics with consonants, but may not strictly fit the definition of a consonant. For example, a sound might be described as consonantlike if it has a relatively constricted articulation, but lacks the complete closure characteristic of a stop consonant.  | The approximants /j/ and /w/ are often considered consonantlike because they involve some constriction of the vocal tract, but don't fully obstruct airflow. | 近义词: consonantal | 反义词: vowel-like
