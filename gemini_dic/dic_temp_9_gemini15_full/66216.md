词源：excited comes from the verb "excite," which originates from the Old French word "exciter," meaning "to rouse, stir up."  The prefix "ex-" means "out" or "from," and the root "-cit-" is related to the Latin word "citare," meaning "to summon, to rouse."  Therefore, "excited" literally means "to be roused or stirred up from within."
