词源:

The word "disparate" comes from the Late Middle English word "disparat," which itself is derived from the Old French word "disparé," meaning "unequal."  The Old French word, in turn, comes from the Latin word "disparātus," the past participle of "disparāre," meaning "to separate" or "to make unequal."  The prefix "dis-" indicates separation or negation, while the root "-parātus" relates to "prepare" or "make ready," suggesting something made unequal or set apart.


用法说明:

Disparate is primarily used as an adjective to describe things that are fundamentally different or distinct in quality or character.  It implies a significant degree of difference, often to the point of incompatibility or incongruity.  It is stronger than simply saying things are "different" and highlights the lack of common ground between the items being described.  It's often used to describe a collection of items that are strikingly unlike one another.
