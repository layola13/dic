deuteroscopy:/ˌdjuːtəˈrɒskəpi/ | n. | 氘镜检查 | Examination of the deuterium content of a substance, typically using spectroscopic methods.  Deuteroscopy is a specialized technique used in various scientific fields to analyze the isotopic composition of materials, particularly the ratio of deuterium (heavy hydrogen) to protium (ordinary hydrogen). This analysis provides valuable insights into the origin, formation processes, and chemical transformations of substances.  | The researchers used deuteroscopy to determine the origin of the ancient water sample. | 近义词： isotopic analysis, mass spectrometry | 反义词：无
