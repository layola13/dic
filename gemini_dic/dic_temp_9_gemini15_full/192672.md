词源:
The word "scuttle" comes from the Old Norse word *skytta, meaning "to shoot" or "to dart".  Later, it evolved to mean "to move quickly", and then to the specific meanings of sinking a ship and abandoning a plan.  The nautical use likely developed from the idea of quickly making holes in a ship's hull to sink it.
