词源:
The word "glower" ultimately derives from the Old English word "glōwan," meaning "to glow" or "to shine."  Over time, the meaning shifted to express a fierce or angry stare, likely due to the association of intense heat and light with anger and aggression.  The modern sense of a dark, angry stare developed through Middle English.
