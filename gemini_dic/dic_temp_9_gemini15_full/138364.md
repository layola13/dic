词源:
The word "notifying" comes from the verb "notify," which itself originates from the Old French word "notifier," meaning "to make known." This ultimately derives from the Latin "notificare," a combination of "notus" (known) and "facere" (to make).  Therefore, the core meaning has remained consistent throughout its history—to make something known.
