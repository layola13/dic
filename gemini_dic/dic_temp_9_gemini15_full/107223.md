词源：The word "laidly" is of Old English origin, deriving from the Old English word *læðlic*, which means "hateful, loathsome, terrible."  It's related to the adjective *læð*, meaning "hateful" or "loathsome."  The modern spelling reflects a later evolution of the word's form.  The word maintained its negative connotations throughout its history.


用法说明：

"Laidly" is primarily used as an adjective to describe something visually unpleasant or morally reprehensible. It carries a strong negative connotation. While it shares similarities with words like "ugly" and "hideous," "laidly" often suggests a more profound sense of repulsiveness or moral disgust.  It is less common in modern usage than its synonyms.  It is more often found in literature evoking older styles or settings.
