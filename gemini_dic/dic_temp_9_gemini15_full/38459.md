WORD ORIGIN->
The word "concessive" comes from the Latin word "concedere," meaning "to yield," "to grant," or "to admit."  The "con-" prefix indicates "together" or "with," and "-cedere" is related to the word "cede," meaning to yield or surrender.  Therefore, "concessive" implies a yielding or granting of a point or argument.
