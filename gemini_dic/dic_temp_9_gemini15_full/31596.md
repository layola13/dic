词源:

The word "chasteners" derives from the verb "chasten," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "chastier," meaning "to punish, correct, or subdue."  This, in turn, has roots in the Latin word "castigare," which has similar meanings.  The "-er" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, indicating an agent or instrument of the action.
