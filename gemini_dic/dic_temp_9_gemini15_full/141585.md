词源:
The word "oppressiveness" is derived from the verb "oppress," which comes from the Late Latin word "oppressus," the past participle of "opprimere."  "Opprimere" is composed of the prefix "ob-" (meaning "against" or "toward") and "premere" (meaning "to press" or "to weigh down"). Therefore, "oppressiveness" ultimately refers to the state of being pressed down upon, burdened, or suppressed.
