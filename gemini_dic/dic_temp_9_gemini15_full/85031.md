词源:

The word "harbinger" comes from the Old French word "herbergier," meaning "lodger" or "host."  In Middle English, it evolved to mean "foreteller," "announcer," or "messenger" and later took on its modern meaning of "a person or thing that indicates the approach of something."  The connection is that a messenger or host arriving would often foreshadow the arrival of a larger group or event.
