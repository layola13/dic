词源:  The word "enveigle" comes from the Old French word "enveogler," which itself is of uncertain origin.  Some etymologists suggest a possible connection to the Latin word "vinculum," meaning "bond" or "tie," reflecting the idea of binding someone to a course of action through persuasion. However, the precise etymology remains debated.
