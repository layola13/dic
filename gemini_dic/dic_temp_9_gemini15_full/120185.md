WORD ORIGIN->
The word "mindlessnesses" is derived from "mindless" + "-ness" (suffix indicating a state or quality) + "-es" (plural suffix).  "Mindless" itself comes from "mind" (the faculty of consciousness) + "-less" (suffix indicating absence or lack of).  Therefore, the word literally means "multiple instances of lacking a mind" or "multiple instances of lacking thought or consideration."
