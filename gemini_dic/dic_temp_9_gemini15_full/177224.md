The word "reasonabilities" is not a standard word in common English usage. It's a noun formed by adding the suffix "-ilities" to "reasonableness," which itself is a noun derived from the adjective "reasonable."  While grammatically correct, it sounds awkward and unnatural to most native speakers.  It attempts to express the plural of "reasonableness," but using the word "reasonablenesses" would be more common, though still somewhat cumbersome.  A more natural way to express the plural idea might be to use phrases like "several reasonable points" or "various reasonable arguments."


USAGE->
There is no standard grammatical usage for "reasonabilities" as it's not a commonly used word.  The usage would follow the rules for plural nouns, but it's recommended to avoid using this word and opt for clearer alternatives.

within reason = 在合理范围内
reasonable doubt = 合理怀疑
reasonable price = 合理价格

reasonable expectation = 合理的期望
