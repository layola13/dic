WORD ORIGIN->
The word "pragmaticality" is derived from the adjective "pragmatical," which itself originates from the Greek word "pragma" (πράγμα), meaning "deed," "action," or "thing."  The "-ical" suffix transforms it into an adjective, and the "-ity" suffix further transforms it into a noun, signifying a quality or state.  The word's evolution reflects a shift from a focus on actions to a focus on a practical, results-oriented approach.
