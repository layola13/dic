Etymology:

The word "obtrusionist" derives from the verb "obtrude," which itself comes from the Latin "obtrudere," meaning "to thrust upon, to force upon."  The prefix "ob-" means "against" or "toward," and "trudere" means "to thrust" or "to push." Thus, the core meaning is "to thrust something against or upon someone." The suffix "-ist" denotes a person or thing characterized by a particular quality or action, creating the adjective "obtrusionist" to describe something or someone exhibiting the act of obtruding.
