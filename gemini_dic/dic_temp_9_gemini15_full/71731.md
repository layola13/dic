词源:

The word "flawlessness" is derived from the word "flaw," meaning an imperfection or defect.  Adding the suffix "-lessness" negates the meaning of "flaw," resulting in "flawlessness," meaning the absence of flaws or imperfections.  The word's history thus traces back to Old English and Germanic roots related to breaking or splitting.
