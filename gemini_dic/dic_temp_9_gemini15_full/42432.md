词源:

The word "counterculturists" is a modern term, a combination of "counterculture" and "-ists".  "Counterculture" itself emerged in the mid-20th century, combining "counter" (meaning against or opposite) with "culture". The "-ists" suffix indicates people who belong to or practice something.  Therefore, the word implies those who actively participate in a culture that opposes the dominant culture.
