词源:
The word "manners" originates from the Old French word "maniere," meaning "manner, way, kind, sort."  This further derives from the Latin word "maneria," meaning "to manage, conduct, direct." The shift in meaning from general way of doing something to specifically social etiquette occurred over time.
