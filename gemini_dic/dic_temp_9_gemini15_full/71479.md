flammability:/ˌflæməˈbɪləti/ | n. | 易燃性，可燃性 | The flammability of the material is a major safety concern.  这种材料的易燃性是一个主要的安全隐患。|近义词：inflammability |反义词：nonflammability, fire resistance

英文解析：The ability of a substance to catch fire and burn easily.  It refers to how readily a material will ignite and how intensely it will burn.  Flammability is often expressed in terms of flash point, which is the lowest temperature at which a liquid can form an ignitable mixture in air.  Higher flammability indicates a greater risk of fire.


例句：

The flammability of gasoline makes it a dangerous substance to handle.  汽油的易燃性使其成为一种危险的物质。

The building codes require materials with low flammability to be used in construction. 建筑规范要求在建筑中使用低易燃性材料。


词源:

From flammable + -ity.  Flammable itself derives from the Latin *flamma (flame) + -able (capable of).  The suffix "-ity" creates a noun signifying a state or quality.
