词源:

The word "preapprehension" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") and the noun "apprehension" (meaning "anxiety" or "fear").  Therefore, it literally means "anxiety or fear before" something.  The root of "apprehension" traces back to the Latin word "apprehendere," which means "to seize" or "to grasp,"  but in its evolution, it took on the meaning of understanding, and then the emotional response of anxiety or fear associated with anticipation.
