sesquisulphide:/ˈsɛskwɪˈsʌlfaɪd/| n.|倍硫化物|A sesquisulphide is a chemical compound containing one and a half sulfur atoms for each metal atom.  The term is often used in older chemical literature and implies a non-stoichiometric ratio, indicating a variable composition that typically falls around a 2:3 ratio (metal:sulfur).  It is not a precise term in modern chemistry.  More precise nomenclature now specifies the exact ratio of elements. | Example:  The mineral pyrrhotite, often described as a ferrous sesquisulfide, actually has a variable composition ranging from FeS to Fe₇S₈.| 近义词:sulfide (with a specified stoichiometric ratio)| 反义词: N/A
