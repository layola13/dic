metapectic: /ˌmɛtəˈpɛktɪk/ | adj. | 中间果胶的；半果胶的 | Relating to or denoting the intermediate stage in the breakdown of pectin, characterized by the formation of metapectates.  Metapectic substances are produced by the partial hydrolysis of pectin. They are less easily precipitated by alcohol than pectin itself. | Example: The enzymatic breakdown of pectin leads to the formation of metapectic acids.  酶促分解果胶导致中间果胶酸的形成。 | 近义词: partially degraded pectin | 反义词: protopectic, fully degraded pectin


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The enzymatic breakdown of pectin produces metapectic substances. = 酶促分解果胶产生中间果胶物质。
This process is crucial in fruit ripening. = 这个过程对水果成熟至关重要。


一般过去时:
Scientists studied the metapectic substances in the fruit. = 科学家们研究了水果中的中间果胶物质。
The experiment demonstrated the formation of metapectic acids. = 实验证明了中间果胶酸的形成。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several enzymes involved in metapectic acid formation. = 研究人员已经确定了几种参与中间果胶酸形成的酶。
The study has shown the importance of metapectic substances in food texture. = 研究表明中间果胶物质对食品质地的重要性。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, the sample had been treated to extract metapectic substances. = 在分析之前，样品已经过处理以提取中间果胶物质。
They had already observed the formation of metapectic substances during the fermentation. = 他们在发酵过程中已经观察到中间果胶物质的形成。


将来时:
We will investigate the role of metapectic substances in plant cell walls. = 我们将研究中间果胶物质在植物细胞壁中的作用。
Future research will focus on the application of metapectic enzymes in food processing. = 未来的研究将集中在食品加工中中间果胶酶的应用。


虚拟语气:
If the pectin were completely hydrolyzed, there would be no metapectic substances. = 如果果胶完全水解，就不会有中间果胶物质。
It is unlikely that the metapectic substances would remain stable under those conditions. = 在那种条件下中间果胶物质不太可能保持稳定。


被动语态:
Metapectic substances are often found in overripe fruits. = 过熟的水果中经常发现中间果胶物质。
The metapectic acids were analyzed using chromatography. = 中间果胶酸是用色谱法分析的。


疑问句:
What are the characteristics of metapectic acids? = 中间果胶酸的特点是什么？
How are metapectic substances formed? = 中间果胶物质是如何形成的？


否定句:
The sample did not contain significant amounts of metapectic substances. = 样品不含有大量的中间果胶物质。
The process did not produce metapectic acids as expected. = 这个过程并没有像预期那样产生中间果胶酸。


PHRASE->

metapectic substances: 中间果胶物质
degree of metapectinization: 中间果胶化程度
metapectic enzyme: 中间果胶酶
formation of metapectic substances: 中间果胶物质的形成
