词源:

The word "misgiving" comes from the Old English "misgifan," meaning "to betray," "to deceive," or "to fail."  The prefix "mis-" indicates a wrong or bad action, while "gifan" is related to the modern English "give."  Over time, the meaning shifted from a betrayal of trust to a feeling of doubt or apprehension arising from a lack of trust or confidence.
