词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "almost," or "somewhat."

* **artistic**: From "art" (from Old French *art*, from Latin *ars, artis*) + "-istic" (a suffix indicating "characteristic of" or "relating to").


Therefore, "quasi-artistically" literally means "as if artistically," or "almost artistically."
