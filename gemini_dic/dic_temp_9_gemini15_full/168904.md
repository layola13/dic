词源:
The word "professionalists" is derived from "professional," which comes from the Middle English word "professione," ultimately from the Late Latin word "professio," meaning "declaration," "avowal," or "public declaration of one's beliefs."  The suffix "-ists" is added to form a noun meaning "those who are engaged in a profession."  The word therefore implies a level of skill and expertise acquired through training and experience.
