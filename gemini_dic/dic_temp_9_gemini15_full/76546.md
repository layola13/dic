词源:
The word "gallant" comes from the Old French word "galant," meaning "lover," "courtier," or "brave man."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin "gallus," meaning "cock" or "Gaul" (ancient inhabitant of Gaul, modern-day France).  The association with bravery likely stems from the cock's aggressive nature.  Over time, the meaning evolved to encompass both bravery and courtly manners.
