preexistentism:/ˌpriːɪɡˈzɪstənˌtɪzəm/ | n. | 预存论，先存论 | The philosophical view that all events, past, present, and future, exist equally and simultaneously.  It contrasts with presentism (the view that only the present exists) and eternalism (a similar view, but with a focus on timelessness). | Example:  Preexistentism is a difficult concept to grasp, as it challenges our intuitive understanding of time.  预存论是一个难以理解的概念，因为它挑战了我们对时间的直觉理解。
