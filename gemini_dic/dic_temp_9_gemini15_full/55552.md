Etymology:  The word "district" comes from the Old French word "district," meaning "region," which itself is derived from the Latin word "districtus," meaning "separated, set apart,"  from the verb "distinguere," meaning "to distinguish" or "to separate."  The Latin root reflects the idea of districts as geographically or administratively distinct areas.
