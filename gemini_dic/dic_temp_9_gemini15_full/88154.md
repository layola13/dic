It is a compound word combining "hill" and "billy," a colloquial term for a man or fellow. Initially, it was a relatively neutral term referring to people who lived in the hills. However, over time, it became associated with negative stereotypes. The term's usage reflects broader societal biases and prejudices against rural populations and distinct cultural groups.
