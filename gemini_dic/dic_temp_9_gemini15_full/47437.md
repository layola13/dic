turn a deaf ear to:  to ignore someone or something.  = 对…充耳不闻
fall on deaf ears: to be ignored.  = 石沉大海，不被理会
deaf and dumb:  (archaic and potentially offensive term) deaf and unable to speak. = 又聋又哑 (过时且可能冒犯的词语)


**Important Note:**  When referring to deaf individuals, it's essential to use person-first language (e.g., "a person who is deaf") unless the individual prefers identity-first language ("a deaf person").  The use of terms like "deaf and dumb" is considered outdated and offensive.
