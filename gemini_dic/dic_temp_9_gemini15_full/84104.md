词源:

The word is a compound adjective.  "Half" indicates a portion or fraction, and "Irish" refers to the people of Ireland or their culture.  The etymology of "Irish" traces back to the Old English "Ír,"  itself deriving from the Latin "Hiberni" (referring to the inhabitants of Hibernia, the Roman name for Ireland).
