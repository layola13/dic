用法说明:

Sleighty is primarily used as an adjective to describe someone's skill, often implying a degree of deception or trickery.  While it can describe genuine dexterity, it more often carries a connotation of cunning or slyness.  The word is not frequently used in modern English, appearing more often in literary contexts or to evoke a sense of archaic style.
