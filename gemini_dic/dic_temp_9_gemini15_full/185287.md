词源:

The word "retreading" is formed from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the verb "treading," which ultimately comes from the Old English word "traedan," meaning "to tread."  Therefore, "retreading" literally means "treading again," referring to the process of applying new tread to a tire.  The application to repeating past actions is a metaphorical extension of this original meaning.
