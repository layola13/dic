词源:
The word "proctorization" is derived from the noun "proctor," which ultimately comes from the Old French word "procureur," meaning "prosecutor" or "agent."  Over time, the meaning shifted to refer to someone who oversees or manages something, particularly examinations.  The "-ization" suffix indicates the process or act of proctoring.
