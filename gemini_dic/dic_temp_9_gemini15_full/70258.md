词源：From Latin *fictitius, from fingere "to fashion, invent".  The word ultimately derives from the Proto-Indo-European root *dheigh-, meaning "to knead, to form."  This reflects the idea of shaping or creating something from nothing.


用法说明：

Fictitious is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that is not real or true, but rather invented or imagined.  It's often used in reference to stories, characters, names, events, and accounts.  The word carries a connotation of deliberate invention, not necessarily deception.  While something fictitious might be untrue, it is not always meant to mislead.  For example, a fictitious name used on a survey is not intended to deceive, but to protect the respondent's privacy.
