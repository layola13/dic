词源:

The word is a compound of "half" (meaning partially) and "reactionary" (referring to opposition to progressive changes). "Reactionary" itself derives from the noun "reaction," ultimately from the Latin "re-" (back) and "agere" (to do, to drive).  The sense of resisting change developed over time.
