词源:

The word "magpie" comes from the Old English word "mægepie," which is a compound of "mæge" (meaning "mag") and "pie" (meaning "pie").  The "mag" element is thought to be related to the bird's call or perhaps a reference to its spotted appearance.  The "pie" element likely refers to the piebald (black and white) coloring of the bird, linking it to other birds with similar markings. The word's evolution reflects the bird's distinctive appearance and behavior.
