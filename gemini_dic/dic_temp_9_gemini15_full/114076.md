magnetos:/mæɡˈniːtoʊz/| n. |磁电机，磁发电机 |A magneto is a device that generates electricity using a magnet.  It's typically used in older engines, especially those in aircraft and motorcycles, to provide ignition.  Modern vehicles generally use alternators instead. |例句：The old airplane’s magneto was unreliable, leading to several aborted takeoffs.|近义词：generator, alternator |反义词：N/A
