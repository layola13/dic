词源：

The word is a combination of "quasi," meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent," and "remarkable," meaning "worthy of notice or attention."  "Quasi" comes from Latin, while "remarkable" has roots in the Old French "remarquer" (to notice).  Therefore, "quasi-remarkable" literally means "seemingly remarkable" or "to a certain extent remarkable."
