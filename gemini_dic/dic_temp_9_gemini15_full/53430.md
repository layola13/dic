disappendency:/ˌdɪsæˈpɛndənsi/| n. |从属关系的消失；脱离；独立|The word "disappendency" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) formed by combining "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and "appendency" (meaning "the state of being appended or subordinate").  Therefore, a precise definition and usage are difficult to provide without further context.  However, based on its morphological structure, it would likely refer to the state of no longer being appended or subordinate; a state of independence or separation.|例句：There is no standard usage example as this is not a standard word.|近义词:independence, autonomy, separation|反义词:dependence, subordination, attachment
