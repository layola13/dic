The word "dring" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a word from a dialect, or a neologism (newly coined word).  To provide an analysis, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered this word.
