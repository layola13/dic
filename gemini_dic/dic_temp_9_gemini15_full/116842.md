词源:
The word "maximations" is derived from the word "maxim," which comes from the Latin word "maximus," meaning "greatest."  A maxim is a concise statement expressing a general truth or principle.  The suffix "-ations" indicates a collection or a process of forming.  Therefore, "maximations" refers to a collection of maxims or the act of creating or compiling them.
