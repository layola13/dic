词源：The word's origin is uncertain, but it is thought to derive from a Middle English term related to "harry" (meaning to harass or raid), suggesting a woman who aggressively bothers others.  Some etymological sources suggest a possible connection to "harried," implying a woman who is constantly harassed or worried, but this is less certain.  Its usage began to appear in the 16th century.
