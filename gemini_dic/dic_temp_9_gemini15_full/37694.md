词源:
The word "companioned" is derived from the noun "companion," which comes from the Old French word "compaignon," meaning "fellow soldier, comrade."  The suffix "-ed" transforms the noun into a past participle, functioning as an adjective or verb.  The ultimate roots lie in the Latin word "cum" (with) and "panis" (bread), referring to the sharing of bread, a symbol of companionship.
