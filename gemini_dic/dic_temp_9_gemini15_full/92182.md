hyperstatic:/ˌhaɪpərˈstætɪk/| adj.|超静定的，多余约束的|Having more supports or constraints than are necessary for static equilibrium;  A hyperstatic structure is one that is over-constrained, meaning it has more supports than are needed to maintain stability. This can lead to increased stress and potential for instability under load.  |例句：The bridge is hyperstatic, making it more resistant to collapse but also more complex to analyze. 这座桥是超静定的，使其更能抵抗坍塌，但也更难分析。  The hyperstatic frame resisted the earthquake forces better than the isostatic one. 超静定框架比静定框架更能抵抗地震力。|近义词：overconstrained,redundant|反义词：isostatic, statically determinate


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The beam is hyperstatic. = 这根梁是超静定的。
This structure is hyperstatic due to the extra supports. = 由于额外的支撑，这个结构是超静定的。


一般过去时:
The engineer determined that the building was hyperstatic. = 工程师确定该建筑物是超静定的。
The analysis showed the system to be hyperstatic. = 分析表明该系统是超静定的。


现在完成时:
They have found that the bridge is hyperstatic. = 他们已经发现这座桥是超静定的。
We have determined the structure to be hyperstatic after the analysis. = 分析后我们确定该结构是超静定的。


过去完成时:
The inspector had already noted that the design was hyperstatic. = 检查员已经注意到该设计是超静定的。
Before the collapse, engineers hadn't realized the structure was hyperstatic. = 在坍塌之前，工程师们没有意识到该结构是超静定的。


将来时:
The software will calculate whether the design is hyperstatic. = 该软件将计算设计是否超静定。
The new bridge will be hyperstatic for increased stability. = 新桥将采用超静定结构以提高稳定性。


虚拟语气:
If the structure were hyperstatic, it would be more resistant to deformation. = 如果结构是超静定的，它将更能抵抗变形。
It would be safer if the building design were not hyperstatic. = 如果建筑设计不是超静定的，会更安全。


被动语态:
The hyperstatic nature of the design was confirmed by the analysis. = 设计的超静定特性已通过分析得到证实。
The problem was identified as a hyperstatic condition. = 问题被确定为超静定条件。


疑问句:
Is the system hyperstatic or isostatic? = 该系统是超静定的还是静定的？
Is this bridge designed to be hyperstatic? = 这座桥的设计是超静定的吗？


否定句:
The structure is not hyperstatic; it's isostatic. = 该结构不是超静定的；它是静定的。
The analysis showed that the system was not hyperstatic. = 分析表明该系统不是超静定的。


PHRASE->
hyperstatic indeterminate structure = 超静不定结构
hyperstatic analysis = 超静定分析
degree of hyperstaticity = 超静定度
hyperstatic framework = 超静定框架
hyperstatic system = 超静定系统
