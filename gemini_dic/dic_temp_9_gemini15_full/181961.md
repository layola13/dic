词源:  The word is a combination of "re-" (again) and "marshal" (to arrange or assemble).  "Marshal" itself comes from Old French *maréchal*, ultimately from Germanic roots related to "horse" and "servant," indicating its original meaning relating to the care and organization of horses and later, troops.
