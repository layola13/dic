isotrimorphism:/ˌaɪsoʊˈtrɪmərfɪzəm/| n. |同晶现象|The phenomenon in which two or more substances crystallize in the same crystalline system with similar axial ratios and angles, despite having different chemical compositions.  This is often observed in minerals where similar ionic radii and charges allow for substitution within the crystal lattice. |Example: The isotrimorphism of the carbonates of calcium, magnesium, and zinc is a well-known example in mineralogy.  同晶现象在矿物学中表现为钙、镁、锌的碳酸盐的同晶现象。|近义词：isomorphism (though less specific)|反义词：polymorphism
