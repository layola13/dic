词源:
The word "haggard" ultimately derives from the Old French word "hagard," meaning "wild," "untamed," or "feral."  This referred to a wild hawk, one that had not been tamed. The connection to the modern meaning of "haggard" lies in the wild, untamed, and exhausted appearance of such a bird. Over time, the word shifted to describe a person's appearance, emphasizing the worn and exhausted look.
