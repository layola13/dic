The word "hoppestere" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or obscure lexicon.  To provide an analysis, I would need more context about where you encountered this word.
