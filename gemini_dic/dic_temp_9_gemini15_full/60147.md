词源：源自于动词effect（产生，造成）加上后缀-uate（使…），表示“使…生效”的意思。  The word's history traces back to the Middle English word "effecten," which itself comes from the Old French "efforcer" (to strive, to achieve).  The suffix "-uate" is a common Latinate suffix that creates verbs denoting to make or cause something to become.
