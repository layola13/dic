词源:
The word "gentle" comes from the Old French word "gentil," meaning "noble," "well-born," or "of good family." This sense eventually evolved to encompass the more modern meaning of kind, soft, and mild.  The Old French "gentil" itself derives from the Latin word "gentilis," which had similar meanings related to lineage and family.
