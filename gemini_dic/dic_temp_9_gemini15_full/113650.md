machineabilities:/ˌmæʃiːnəˈbɪlətiz/| n. |机器能力；机器性能|The term "machineabilities" is not a standard English word. It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word, combining "machine" and "abilities."  It refers to the capabilities and potential of machines, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence and automation. It suggests the range of tasks and functions a machine can perform.  The word emphasizes the inherent potential and skillset of a machine, rather than simply its functionality.|Example:  The research team explored the machineabilities of the new AI system, testing its capacity for learning and problem-solving.|近义词: machine capabilities, machine intelligence, automation potential|反义词:  incapabilities (of machines), limitations (of machines)
