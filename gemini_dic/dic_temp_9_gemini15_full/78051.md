词源:

The word "Genuss" comes from the Middle High German word "genuz," meaning "enjoyment, pleasure."  This, in turn, derives from the Old High German word "genuzz," which shares roots with words meaning "use," "utility," and "enjoyment" in other Germanic languages.  The ultimate origin is likely Proto-Germanic *ganōtan, meaning "to enjoy."
