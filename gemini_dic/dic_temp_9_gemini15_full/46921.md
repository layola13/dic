词源:

The word "darky" is derived from "dark," referring to skin color, combined with a diminutive suffix "-y." Its origins are tied to the era of slavery in the United States and other parts of the world where people of African descent were enslaved. The term was used to dehumanize and demean Black individuals, reducing them to a racial stereotype.  Its use was prevalent in minstrel shows and other forms of racist entertainment, further solidifying its negative connotations.  The evolution of the term reflects a long history of systemic racism and oppression.
