presolving: /ˈpriːsɒlviŋ/ | v. | 预处理，预求解 |  The process of simplifying or improving a problem before applying a solution algorithm. This often involves techniques to reduce the problem's size or complexity, making it easier and faster to solve.  | Example: Presolving techniques significantly reduced the computation time required for solving the linear programming problem. 预处理技术显著减少了解决线性规划问题所需的计算时间。 | 近义词：preprocessing, simplification | 反义词：postprocessing


USAGE->

虚拟语气:
If we presolved the data, the results would be more reliable. = 如果我们预处理数据，结果将更可靠。
It would be beneficial if they presolved the problem before attempting a solution. = 如果他们在尝试解决方案之前预处理问题，那将是有益的。


被动语态:
The data was presolved by the program before analysis. = 数据在分析之前由程序预处理。
