词源:
From the Greek word  ἐπίθετον (epithetōn), the neuter plural of ἐπίθετος (epithetōs), meaning "added," "attributed," related to  ἐπι- (epi-) "upon," "on," +  τιθέναι (tithenai) "to place," "to put."  The original meaning referred to an adjective added to a noun for descriptive purposes, later evolving to its current usage.
