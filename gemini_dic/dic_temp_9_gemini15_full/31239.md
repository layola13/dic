词源:
The word "chanticleer" is derived from Old French *chanticleer*, which itself comes from *chanter* ("to sing") + *clair* ("clear").  Therefore, it literally means "clear singer" or "one who sings clearly," referring to the rooster's crow.  The word was popularized in English literature through Geoffrey Chaucer's *The Canterbury Tales*, where it is used to describe the rooster in the "Nun Priest's Tale."
