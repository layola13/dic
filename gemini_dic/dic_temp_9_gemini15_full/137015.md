英文解析:
The word "nonstainable" is formed by adding the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") to the adjective "stainable" (meaning "capable of being stained").  Therefore, it describes something that resists staining or is difficult to color.  This resistance can be due to the material's inherent properties or a treatment applied to it.


例句：

The lab coat is made of a nonstainable fabric. = 这件实验服是由不易染色的织物制成的。

This nonstainable countertop is perfect for a busy kitchen. = 这种不易染色的台面非常适合繁忙的厨房。


词源:

* **stain:** From Old French *estaindre* "to extinguish, quench," from Latin *extinguere*, from *ex-* "out" + *stinguere* "to extinguish," akin to *stinctus* "extinguished."  The sense evolved from "quenching" a fire to "quenching" a color.

* **-able:** A suffix forming adjectives from verbs and nouns, signifying "capable of," "worthy of," or "liable to."

* **non-:** A prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of."


注意：由于“nonstainable”本身是一个形容词，因此没有动词、名词等其他词性变化的用法。  它主要用于描述物质的特性。
