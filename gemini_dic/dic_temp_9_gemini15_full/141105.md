近义词：Ontarian (as a noun) could be loosely replaced with "resident of Ontario", "Onta-rioan"  (though less common). There isn't a direct antonym as it's a proper adjective/noun referring to a specific place.  You could use terms like "Quebecer" or "Albertan" to refer to residents of other Canadian provinces as contrasting examples.
