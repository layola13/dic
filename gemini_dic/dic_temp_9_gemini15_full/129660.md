词源:
The word "non-deductible" is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the adjective "deductible" (able to be deducted).  "Deductible" comes from the verb "deduct," ultimately derived from the Latin word "deducere," meaning "to lead away or down."  Therefore, "non-deductible" means "not able to be subtracted or deducted."
