The word "shaleyest" is not a standard English word.  It does not appear in any major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical explanation are impossible.  To provide an answer in the requested format would be misleading.

To help, if you can provide context where you encountered this word (sentence, paragraph, etc.), I might be able to offer a guess as to its intended meaning and a possible correction.  Alternatively, if it's a word from a specific field of study or a fictional context, providing that information would also be useful.
