USAGE->
This word is largely obsolete and doesn't lend itself to grammatical tense variations in the same way as common verbs or nouns.  Its usage is primarily descriptive and historical, referring to a now-outdated classification system.  Therefore, examples of verb tenses etc. are not applicable.

PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "moneron".  The word itself is rarely used in modern biological contexts.
