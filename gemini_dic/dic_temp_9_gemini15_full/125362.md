Etymology:

The word "multiloquous" is derived from the Latin prefix "multi-" meaning "many" or "much," and the Latin word "loquor," meaning "to speak."  Therefore, it literally translates to "speaking much."


Usage Examples:

1.  He was known for his multiloquous speeches, often rambling on for hours. 他以冗长的演讲而闻名，经常滔滔不绝地讲上几个小时。

2. The multiloquous professor kept the students engaged despite the lecture's length.  这位话多的教授尽管讲座很长，但还是让学生们保持了兴趣。


Note:  There's no specific grammatical tense or voice associated with the adjective "multiloquous."  Its usage remains consistent across different grammatical structures.  It simply describes a characteristic of a person or their speech.  The verb forms (speaking, spoke, etc) would describe the actions of speech itself.
