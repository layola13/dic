词源:

The word "quarterback" originated in American football.  The term combines "quarter" (referring to the position on the field, originally positioned a quarter of the way down the field) and "back" (referring to the player's position behind the offensive line).  The exact etymology is debated, but its usage solidified in the early 20th century as the role of the quarterback evolved.
