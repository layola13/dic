The word "califs" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a variant spelling of "caliphs."  Therefore, I will provide the analysis for "caliphs."


caliphs:/ˈkælifs/| n. |哈里发（复数）|Caliphs are the successors to the Prophet Muhammad as the religious and political leaders of Islam.  The caliphate was a significant period in Islamic history, marked by expansion, intellectual flourishing, and political intrigue.
