例句 2:  The medication aimed to neutralize the stomach's peptohydrochloric environment. 该药物旨在中和胃的胃蛋白酶盐酸环境。


PHRASE->
Peptohydrochloric activity: 胃蛋白酶盐酸活性
Peptohydrochloric digestion: 胃蛋白酶盐酸消化
Peptohydrochloric environment: 胃蛋白酶盐酸环境

词源:
The word "peptohydrochloric" is a combination of:

* **pepto-**: From "pepsin," an enzyme found in gastric juice that breaks down proteins.  "Pepsin" itself originates from Greek πέψις (pēpsis), meaning "digestion."
* **hydro-**: From Greek ὕδωρ (hydōr), meaning "water."
* **chloric**: From "chloric acid,"  a general term referring to acids containing chlorine (Though in this context it relates to hydrochloric acid).  "Hydrochloric" comes from "hydro-" and "chloric," referring to its composition of hydrogen and chlorine.


Therefore, "peptohydrochloric" literally means "relating to pepsin and hydrochloric acid."
