semidependences:/ˌsɛmiˈdɪpɛndənsiz/| n. |半依赖关系，部分依赖性|Partial dependencies in a database, where a non-key attribute is functionally dependent on only part of a candidate key.  This violates the rules of normalization, potentially leading to data redundancy and update anomalies.| Example: In a table with attributes (OrderID, CustomerID, CustomerName, OrderTotal), CustomerName is semidependent on OrderID because it only depends on CustomerID (part of the composite key OrderID, CustomerID).|近义词:partial dependencies|反义词:full dependencies, complete dependencies|名词


例句：

The database design suffered from numerous semidependences, resulting in update anomalies.  数据库设计存在许多半依赖关系，导致更新异常。

Resolving the semidependences improved the database's efficiency and integrity.  解决半依赖关系提高了数据库的效率和完整性。


词源:

The word "semidependences" is a combination of "semi-" (meaning "half" or "partly") and "dependences" (the plural of "dependence," meaning a state of relying on something else).  The term arises from database normalization theory, where it describes a specific type of relationship between attributes in a database table.
