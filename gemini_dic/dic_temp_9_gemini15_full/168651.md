The word "procompromise" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your format is impossible.  To help you, I can offer possibilities based on what the word *might* be intended to mean:

**Possibility 1:  A misspelling of "compromise"**

**Possibility 2:  A prefix "pro-" added to "compromise"**

This would suggest a word meaning something like "in favor of compromise" or "supporting compromise."  However, this isn't a standard word.  The meaning would depend heavily on context.  There's no established usage or dictionary entry.


**Conclusion:**

Without more context about where you encountered "procompromise," it's impossible to give a definitive analysis.  If it was a typo, the analysis of "compromise" above is relevant. If it's a newly coined word, its meaning and usage would need further clarification.
