词源:
From Middle English *clerical, from Old French clericale, from Latin clericālis, from clericus "clerk," from Greek κλῆρος (klēros) "lot, heritage, clergy".  The connection lies in the fact that in the early Christian church, clerks were assigned tasks based on lots or assignments, and later developed into the administrative roles we now associate with the word.
