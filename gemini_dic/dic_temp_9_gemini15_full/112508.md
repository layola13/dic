词源:
The word "lousiness" is derived from the adjective "lousy," which ultimately comes from the Middle English word "louse," meaning "louse" (a small insect).  The connection is that something lousy is considered to be infested with lice, implying something unpleasant, worthless, or of poor quality.  The suffix "-iness" creates a noun meaning "the state or quality of being lousy."
