The word "nowes" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or archaic dialect.
