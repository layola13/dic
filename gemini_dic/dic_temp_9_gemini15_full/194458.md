self-reproduction:/ˌsɛlfˌriːprəˈdʌkʃən/| n. |自我复制，自体繁殖|The ability of an organism or system to create copies of itself.  This process is fundamental to life and is seen in various forms, from cellular division in living organisms to the replication of viruses and even the self-replication of certain computer programs.  |例句：The virus exhibited remarkable self-reproduction, quickly overwhelming the host's defenses.  病毒表现出显著的自我复制能力，迅速压倒了宿主的防御机制。|例句：Cellular self-reproduction is a complex process involving DNA replication and cell division. 细胞的自我复制是一个复杂的过程，涉及DNA复制和细胞分裂。|近义词：replication, duplication, self-replication|反义词：destruction, decay|名词
