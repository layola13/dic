mercantilism:/ˈmɜːkəntaɪlɪzəm/| n. |重商主义|An economic system (dating roughly from the 16th to the 18th century) in which a nation's wealth is measured by its accumulation of gold and silver.  Mercantilist policies aimed to maximize exports and minimize imports, often through government regulation and protectionist measures.  The goal was to create a favorable balance of trade, leading to increased national power and prosperity. |Example:  The British Empire's prosperity during the 17th and 18th centuries was, in part, a result of its mercantilist policies. = 17和18世纪大英帝国的繁荣，部分原因是其重商主义政策的结果。

The rise of mercantilism coincided with the growth of nation-states and the expansion of overseas trade.  Mercantilist ideas heavily influenced colonial policies, with colonies often serving as sources of raw materials and markets for finished goods from the mother country.  Critiques of mercantilism emerged during the 18th century, with proponents of free trade arguing that it led to inefficiency and hindered economic growth. |近义词：protectionism, economic nationalism |反义词：free trade, laissez-faire
