The word "professionary" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  If it were intended to mean something related to a profession, the correct word would be "professional".  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis as requested.  If you meant "professional", please let me know and I will gladly provide the analysis.
