词源:  Derived from "gimbal," which itself has a complex etymology.  The word "gimbal" likely originates from the Old French "gimbale," possibly related to the Old High German "kimbal" meaning "cup" or "bowl," referring to the shape of the early gimbal rings.  The "-ed" suffix indicates the past participle,  describing something that has been treated or fitted with a gimbal.
