nonrefracting: /ˌnɒnˈrɪfræktɪŋ/ | adj. | 不折射的 | Not bending or changing the direction of light.  This term describes materials that allow light to pass through without being bent or deflected.  | Example: The lens is made of nonrefracting material to avoid distortion.  该透镜由不折射的材料制成，以避免失真。 | 近义词: transparent, clear, achromatic | 反义词: refracting


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The glass is nonrefracting. = 这个玻璃是不折射的。
This material is nonrefracting to visible light. =这种材料对可见光是不折射的。


一般过去时:
The experiment showed the material was nonrefracting. = 实验表明该材料是不折射的。
The scientist confirmed that the substance was nonrefracting. = 科学家证实该物质是不折射的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have developed a new nonrefracting material. = 科学家已经开发出一种新型的不折射材料。
They have found that this substance is nonrefracting. = 他们发现这种物质是不折射的。


过去完成时:
Researchers had already determined that the crystal was nonrefracting. = 研究人员已经确定该晶体是不折射的。
Before the test, they had assumed the medium was nonrefracting. = 在测试之前，他们假设介质是不折射的。


将来时:
We will use a nonrefracting lens in the next experiment. = 我们将在下一次实验中使用一个不折射的透镜。
They will test whether the new material is truly nonrefracting. = 他们将测试新材料是否真正不折射。


虚拟语气:
If the material were nonrefracting, the image would be clearer. = 如果材料是不折射的，图像就会更清晰。
I wish the lens were nonrefracting. = 我希望这个透镜是不折射的。


被动语态:
A nonrefracting lens is used in this type of microscope. = 此类显微镜使用不折射透镜。
The properties of the nonrefracting material are being investigated. = 正在研究不折射材料的特性。


疑问句:
Is this material nonrefracting? = 这种材料是不折射的吗？
Are there any known naturally occurring nonrefracting substances? = 有任何已知的天然不折射物质吗？


否定句:
The lens is not completely nonrefracting; it shows slight refraction. = 该透镜并非完全不折射；它显示出轻微的折射。
This substance is not nonrefracting; it bends light significantly. = 这种物质不是不折射的；它会显著弯曲光线。


PHRASE->
nonrefracting lens = 不折射透镜
nonrefracting medium = 不折射介质
nonrefracting window = 不折射窗口
nonrefracting material = 不折射材料
nonrefracting optical element = 不折射光学元件
