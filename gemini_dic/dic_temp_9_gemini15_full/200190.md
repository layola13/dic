词源:The word "skinflint" originates from the obsolete word "flint," which referred to a hard, stony substance.  The implication is that a skinflint is as hard and unyielding as flint when it comes to parting with their money. The "skin" part might emphasize the close grip they have on their possessions, almost as if their money is part of their skin.
