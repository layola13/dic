hyphae:/ˈhaɪfiː/| n. |菌丝| Branched filaments that collectively make up the mycelium of a fungus.  Hyphae are the basic structural units of most fungi, absorbing nutrients and spreading throughout their substrate. | Example: The hyphae of the mushroom extended deep into the soil, absorbing nutrients.  菌丝体延伸到土壤深处，吸收养分。  |近义词：filament, thread |反义词：N/A


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The hyphae grow rapidly in warm, moist conditions. = 菌丝在温暖潮湿的条件下生长迅速。
Fungal hyphae absorb nutrients from the surrounding environment. = 真菌菌丝从周围环境中吸收养分。

一般过去时:
The hyphae extended several centimeters into the wood. = 菌丝延伸到木材中几厘米。
Scientists observed the hyphae under a microscope. = 科学家在显微镜下观察菌丝。

现在完成时:
The hyphae have colonized the entire petri dish. = 菌丝已经遍布整个培养皿。
Researchers have studied the hyphae's role in decomposition. = 研究人员已经研究了菌丝在分解中的作用。

过去完成时:
The hyphae had already spread before the treatment began. = 在治疗开始之前，菌丝已经蔓延。
The experiment showed that the hyphae had reacted to the change in temperature. = 实验表明菌丝已经对温度变化做出了反应。

将来时:
The hyphae will continue to grow if the conditions remain favorable. = 如果条件仍然有利，菌丝将继续生长。
Scientists predict that the hyphae will reach the other side of the container soon. = 科学家预测菌丝很快就会到达容器的另一侧。

虚拟语气:
If the hyphae were exposed to sunlight, they would die. = 如果菌丝暴露在阳光下，它们就会死亡。
It is essential that the hyphae remain moist for optimal growth. = 菌丝保持湿润对于最佳生长至关重要。

被动语态:
The hyphae were observed under a high-powered microscope. = 菌丝在高倍显微镜下被观察。
The growth of the hyphae was significantly affected by the change in pH. = 菌丝的生长受到pH值变化的显著影响。

疑问句:
How long do the hyphae take to colonize a new substrate? = 菌丝需要多长时间才能定殖新的基质？
What are the characteristics of these hyphae? = 这些菌丝的特性是什么？

否定句:
The hyphae did not grow in the dry conditions. = 菌丝在干燥条件下没有生长。
The experiment showed that the hyphae were not affected by the chemical. = 实验表明菌丝不受该化学物质的影响。


PHRASE->
