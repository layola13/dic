词源:
The word "rumouring" derives from the noun "rumour" (or "rumor" in American English), which itself ultimately comes from the Old French word "romor," meaning "murmur," "noise," or "rumble."  The Old French word, in turn, has roots in the Latin word "rumor," with a similar meaning.  The "-ing" suffix transforms the noun into a present participle, indicating an ongoing action.
