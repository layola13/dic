词源：

* **quasi-**: This prefix comes from Latin, meaning "as if," "apparently," or "seemingly."  It indicates something that resembles or partially possesses the characteristics of something else.

* **doubtfully**: This word is derived from "doubt," which comes from Old French "douter" and ultimately from Latin "dubitare," meaning "to hesitate" or "to be in doubt."  The "-fully" suffix transforms the adjective "doubtful" into an adverb, modifying verbs to describe how an action is performed.


Therefore, "quasi-doubtfully" combines the sense of "seemingly" or "partially" with "doubtfully," resulting in a nuanced description of an action or expression conveying partial or hesitant doubt.
