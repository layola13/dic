词源:

The word "seamanship" is derived from the Old English word "sǣmann," meaning "sailor" or "seaman," combined with the suffix "-ship," indicating skill, ability, or condition.  The "-ship" suffix is common in English, appearing in words like "friendship," "leadership," and "scholarship." Therefore, "seamanship" literally means "the skill or quality of a seaman."
