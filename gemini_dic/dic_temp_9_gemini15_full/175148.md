词源:
The word "ragamuffin" is a compound word.  "Rag" refers to old, torn cloth, and "muffin" was originally a term of contempt or for a simple, unrefined person. The combination creates a vivid image of a person dressed in tattered clothes, typically a child.  The exact origin of the "muffin" part in this context is unclear, but it likely evolved from its association with something common and unassuming.
