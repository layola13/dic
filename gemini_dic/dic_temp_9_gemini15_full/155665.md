词源:  The word "phlegmiest" is the superlative form of "phlegmatic," which ultimately derives from the Greek word "phlegma" (φλέγμα), meaning "phlegm." In ancient Greek medicine, phlegm was one of four humors believed to govern temperament. An excess of phlegm was associated with a calm, unemotional disposition.  The suffix "-iest" indicates the superlative degree, signifying the highest degree of the quality.
