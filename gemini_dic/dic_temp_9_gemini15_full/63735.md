epiboly:/ˈɛpɪbəli/| n. |外包，上胚层扩展|The spreading of the blastoderm over the yolk in the developing embryo.  Epiboly is a crucial process in gastrulation, leading to the formation of germ layers.|例句：During gastrulation, epiboly of the ectoderm covers the yolk.|近义词：overgrowth, expansion |反义词：involution


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Epiboly occurs during early embryonic development. = 外包发生在胚胎早期发育过程中。
The ectoderm undergoes epiboly to cover the yolk. = 外胚层进行外包以覆盖卵黄。

一般过去时:
Epiboly completed before gastrulation began. = 在原肠胚形成开始之前，外包完成了。
The researchers observed epiboly in the zebrafish embryos. = 研究人员在斑马鱼胚胎中观察到了外包。

现在完成时:
Scientists have studied epiboly extensively. = 科学家们已经广泛研究了外包。
The model has successfully simulated the process of epiboly. = 该模型已成功模拟了外包过程。

过去完成时:
The yolk had already been covered by epiboly before the next stage. = 在下一阶段之前，卵黄已经被外包覆盖了。
The researchers had found evidence of incomplete epiboly in some embryos. = 研究人员在一些胚胎中发现了外包不完全的证据。

将来时:
Further research will investigate the mechanisms of epiboly. = 进一步的研究将调查外包的机制。
We will observe the epiboly process in real-time using microscopy. = 我们将使用显微镜实时观察外包过程。

虚拟语气:
If epiboly failed, gastrulation would be affected. = 如果外包失败，原肠胚形成就会受到影响。
It is important that epiboly occurs correctly for proper development. = 外包正确发生对于适当的发育至关重要。

被动语态:
Epiboly is driven by cell division and cell rearrangement. = 外包是由细胞分裂和细胞重排驱动的。
The timing of epiboly is carefully regulated. = 外包的时间被仔细调节。

疑问句:
What factors influence the rate of epiboly? = 哪些因素影响外包的速度？
How does epiboly contribute to gastrulation? = 外包如何促进原肠胚形成？

否定句:
Incomplete epiboly can lead to developmental defects. = 外包不完全会导致发育缺陷。
The experiment did not show significant changes in epiboly. = 实验没有显示外包的显著变化。


PHRASE->
rate of epiboly = 外包速度
mechanism of epiboly = 外包机制
stages of epiboly = 外包阶段
control of epiboly = 外包控制
inhibition of epiboly = 外包抑制
