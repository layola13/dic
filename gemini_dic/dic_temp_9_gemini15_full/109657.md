leucitoid:/ˈluːsɪtɔɪd/| adj.| 类白榴石的，似白榴石的 | Resembling leucite in appearance or crystallographic properties.  A leucitoid mineral exhibits characteristics similar to leucite, a potassium aluminum silicate mineral.  | Example: The newly discovered mineral displayed leucitoid characteristics, leading researchers to further investigate its composition.  The rock sample contained several leucitoid crystals. |近义词：leucite-like |反义词：无


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The mineral sample shows leucitoid characteristics. = 矿物样本显示出类白榴石的特性。
This rock contains several leucitoid crystals. = 这块岩石包含几个类白榴石晶体。


一般过去时:
Geologists identified leucitoid structures in the volcanic rock. = 地质学家在火山岩中发现了类白榴石结构。
The analysis revealed the presence of leucitoid minerals. = 分析显示存在类白榴石矿物。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered several new leucitoid minerals. = 科学家们已经发现了多种新的类白榴石矿物。
Researchers have confirmed the leucitoid nature of the sample. = 研究人员已经证实了样品的类白榴石性质。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, they had suspected leucitoid inclusions. = 在分析之前，他们怀疑有类白榴石包裹体。
The geologists had already documented similar leucitoid formations. = 地质学家们已经记录了类似的类白榴石构造。


将来时:
Future studies will investigate the formation of leucitoid minerals. = 未来的研究将调查类白榴石矿物的形成。
Researchers will analyze the sample for leucitoid characteristics. = 研究人员将分析样品的类白榴石特性。


虚拟语气:
If the mineral were leucitoid, it would have a specific crystal structure. = 如果矿物是类白榴石的，它将具有特定的晶体结构。
I wish I had known more about leucitoid minerals before the expedition. = 我希望在考察之前对类白榴石矿物了解更多。


被动语态:
The leucitoid crystals were identified under a microscope. = 类白榴石晶体在显微镜下被识别出来。
The rock's leucitoid composition was confirmed by X-ray diffraction. = 岩石的类白榴石成分通过X射线衍射得到证实。


疑问句:
Is this mineral truly leucitoid in nature? = 这种矿物本质上真的是类白榴石的吗？
Are there any other leucitoid formations in this region? = 这个地区还有其他类白榴石构造吗？


否定句:
The sample did not exhibit typical leucitoid features. = 样本没有表现出典型的类白榴石特征。
This mineral is not considered leucitoid based on its chemical composition. = 根据其化学成分，这种矿物不被认为是类白榴石。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "leucitoid" as it is a relatively specialized term in geology.  The word itself is primarily used in descriptive contexts within scientific writing.  Instead, related phrases might be:

leucite-like minerals: 类白榴石状矿物
similar to leucite: 与白榴石相似
pseudo-leucite: 假白榴石 (a specific type of leucitoid)
presence of leucite: 白榴石的存在
characteristics of leucite: 白榴石的特性
