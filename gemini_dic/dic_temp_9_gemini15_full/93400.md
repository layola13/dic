illision:/ɪˈluʒən/| n.|幻想；错觉；假象|The magician created an illusion of a disappearing rabbit.  魔术师创造了一个兔子消失的幻觉。|近义词：delusion, hallucination, fantasy|反义词：reality, truth|


英文解析：An illusion is a deceptive appearance or impression; something that looks or seems different from what it really is.  It often involves a misinterpretation of sensory information, leading to a false perception of reality. Illusions can be created intentionally (like in magic tricks) or unintentionally (due to psychological factors or physical limitations).
