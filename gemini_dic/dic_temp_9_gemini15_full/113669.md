The word "{machs}" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling, a word from another language (possibly German, where "machst" means "you do" or "you make"), or a very informal or slang term.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis in the requested format.  To help me assist you, please provide the correct spelling or context where you encountered this word.
