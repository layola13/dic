词源:
The word "earnest" ultimately derives from the Old English word "earnæst," meaning "serious, sincere, true."  This word, in turn, is related to the verb "earn," suggesting a connection to something of value or worth, something gained through effort and commitment.  The evolution of meaning reflects a shift from a sense of seriousness and sincerity to the more concrete concept of a payment or deposit as a sign of seriousness in a transaction.
