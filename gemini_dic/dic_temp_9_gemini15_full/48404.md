词源:
The word "dedication" comes from the Latin word "dedicatio," which is a combination of "dedicare," meaning "to dedicate," and the suffix "-atio," indicating an action or process.  "Dedicare" itself is formed from "de-" (intensive prefix) and "dicare," meaning "to proclaim," "to declare," or "to consecrate."  The original sense therefore implied a formal act of proclaiming something sacred or setting it apart for a specific purpose.
