jahvist: /ˈdʒɑːvɪst/ | n. | 犹太教雅威教派信徒 | A follower of Yahwism, a religion centered on the worship of Yahweh (Jehovah).  This term is primarily used in academic religious studies to refer to those who worshipped Yahweh before the development of Judaism as a fully codified religion.  It doesn't represent a specific, unified religious group in the way "Christian" or "Muslim" do. | Example:  Scholars debate the practices and beliefs of early Jahvists in the Canaanite region.  学者们争论迦南地区早期雅威教派信徒的习俗和信仰。 | 近义词: early Israelite, proto-Israelite (these terms are related but not exact synonyms)| 反义词:  None specifically, as it describes a religious affiliation rather than a position on a moral spectrum. |  n.
