词源:

The word "pontificals" derives from the Latin word "pontifex," meaning "bridge-builder," a title originally associated with Roman priests responsible for maintaining bridges and other public works.  Over time, the term "pontifex maximus" ("greatest bridge-builder") became associated with the chief priest of the Roman religion, and eventually evolved into the title "Pope" in the Catholic Church.  The suffix "-ical" denotes something relating to or characteristic of. Thus, "pontificals" refers to items or actions related to the Pope's office and authority.
