preinsulated:/ˌpriːˈɪnsjʊleɪtɪd/ | adj. | 预先绝缘的 |  Preinsulated refers to something that has been insulated before being installed or used.  This typically applies to pipes, conduits, or other components where insulation is applied at the factory rather than on-site.  This method offers improved efficiency and reduces installation time and cost. | Example: The preinsulated pipes were easily connected to the system, saving significant installation time.  The building used preinsulated ductwork to minimize heat loss. | 近义词: pre-insulated, factory-insulated | 反义词: uninsulated
