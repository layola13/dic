schizocoelous:/ˌskɪzoʊˈsiːləs/| adj. |裂体腔的|  Relating to or characterized by schizocoely, the formation of the coelom (body cavity) by splitting of the mesoderm (middle germ layer) during embryonic development.  This is in contrast to enterocoely, where the coelom forms from outpocketings of the gut. | Example:  "The development of the coelom in annelids is schizocoelous."  =  环节动物的体腔发育是裂体腔的。|近义词:  (lacks direct synonyms, but related terms include: mesodermal, coelomic)|反义词: enterocoelous


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in a biological context, specifically in zoology and embryology.  There aren't common everyday usages like with words like "hello".  The grammatical usage follows standard adjective rules.

一般现在时:
The annelid's coelom formation is schizocoelous. = 环节动物的体腔形成是裂体腔的。
This organism exhibits a schizocoelous developmental pattern. = 这种生物表现出裂体腔发育模式。


一般过去时:
The textbook described the schizocoelous development of mollusks. = 教材描述了软体动物的裂体腔发育。
Scientists observed a schizocoelous coelom in the embryo. = 科学家在胚胎中观察到裂体腔。


现在完成时:
Researchers have confirmed the schizocoelous nature of this species. = 研究人员已经证实了该物种的裂体腔性质。
Studies have shown that many protostomes are schizocoelous. = 研究表明许多原口动物是裂体腔的。


过去完成时:
Before the discovery, the developmental pathway was thought not to be schizocoelous. = 在发现之前，人们认为发育途径不是裂体腔的。
They had previously believed the coelom formation to be enterocoelous, not schizocoelous. = 他们之前认为体腔形成是肠体腔的，而不是裂体腔的。


将来时:
Future research will investigate the genetic basis of schizocoelous development. = 未来的研究将调查裂体腔发育的遗传基础。
We will determine if this invertebrate displays schizocoelous characteristics. = 我们将确定这种无脊椎动物是否显示裂体腔特征。


虚拟语气:
If the organism were schizocoelous, we would expect this morphology. = 如果生物是裂体腔的，我们会预期这种形态。
It would be surprising if this species were not schizocoelous. = 如果这个物种不是裂体腔的，那将是令人惊讶的。


被动语态:
The schizocoelous development of the coelom was described in detail. = 体腔的裂体腔发育被详细描述。
The evolutionary origins of schizocoely are being actively researched. = 裂体腔的进化起源正在积极研究中。


疑问句:
Is the coelom formation in this animal schizocoelous or enterocoelous? =  这种动物的体腔形成是裂体腔的还是肠体腔的？
Are all protostomes characterized by schizocoelous development? = 所有原口动物都具有裂体腔发育特征吗？


否定句:
The coelom in this species is not schizocoelous; it's enterocoelous. =  这个物种的体腔不是裂体腔的；它是肠体腔的。
The hypothesis that all animals are schizocoelous is not supported by evidence. = 所有动物都是裂体腔的这一假设没有证据支持。
