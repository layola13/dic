inductorium:/ɪnˈdʌktəriəm/| n. |感应线圈；感应器|An inductorium is an early type of induction coil used to generate high-voltage pulses from a low-voltage direct current source.  It was a crucial component in early experiments with electricity and played a significant role in the development of telegraphy and other electrical technologies.  It typically consisted of two coils of wire wound around a core, often made of iron. One coil, the primary coil, carried a low-voltage current, and the other coil, the secondary coil, produced a high-voltage output.  The switching of the primary current induced a high-voltage pulse in the secondary coil. |The scientist used an inductorium to create sparks for his experiments.  科学家用感应线圈进行实验产生火花。|induction coil, Ruhmkorff coil |  (no direct antonym, as it describes a specific device)|名词
