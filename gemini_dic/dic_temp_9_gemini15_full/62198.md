词源:
The word "encounter" comes from the Old French word "encontrer," which means "to meet, to run into."  This word itself is derived from the prefix "en-" (meaning "in" or "into") and the verb "contrer" (meaning "to meet" or "to oppose").  The ultimate origin can be traced to the Latin word "contra" meaning "against" or "opposite".  This reflects the original sense of the word, often implying a meeting that could be confrontational or challenging, although modern usage is more neutral.
