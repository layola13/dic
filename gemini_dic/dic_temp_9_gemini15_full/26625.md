词源：The word is a combination of "cack" (a sound suggesting ineptitude or foolishness) and "handedly" (referring to the manner of using one's hands).  The "cack" element might be related to the onomatopoeic word for the sound a hen makes, suggesting a somewhat disorderly or uncontrolled action.  The exact etymology is unclear and the word is relatively informal.
