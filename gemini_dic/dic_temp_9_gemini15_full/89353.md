homology:/hɒˈmɒlədʒi/ /həˈmɑːlədʒi/ | n. | 同源性，同系，同源 | The study of homology focuses on similarities in structure, physiology, or development between different organisms, suggesting a shared evolutionary ancestry. Homology implies that the structures or characteristics being compared originated from a common ancestor, even if their current functions may differ.  For example, the forelimbs of humans, bats, and whales are homologous structures, all derived from the same ancestral limb, despite their different functions (manipulation, flight, and swimming, respectively). |  The homologous structures of the bat wing and the human hand demonstrate a shared ancestry.  =  蝙蝠翅膀和人手的同源结构证明了它们有共同的祖先。

The evolutionary relationship between the horse and the donkey is shown by their homologous chromosomes. = 马和驴的进化关系可以通过它们的同源染色体来体现。


近义词：similarity, analogy, correspondence | 反义词：analogy (when used to contrast with true homology),  antagonism


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Homology explains the similarities between seemingly disparate species. = 同源性解释了看似不同的物种之间的相似之处。

过去完成时:
Before the discovery, they hadn't understood the homology between the two species. = 在发现之前，他们没有理解这两个物种之间的同源性。
The scientists had already confirmed the homology of the fossils. = 科学家们已经证实了这些化石的同源性。


将来时:
Future research will explore the homology of more complex systems. = 未来的研究将探索更复杂系统的同源性。

虚拟语气:
If the homology were more obvious, the relationship would be easier to understand. = 如果同源性更明显，关系就更容易理解。
It is important that the homology analysis be rigorously conducted. =  同源性分析必须严格进行。


被动语态:
Homologous structures are often used to infer evolutionary relationships. = 同源结构通常被用来推断进化关系。
The homology of the genes was determined through sequencing. = 基因的同源性是通过测序确定的。


疑问句:
What is the homology between these two proteins? = 这两种蛋白质之间的同源性是什么？
Does the homology suggest a close evolutionary relationship? = 同源性是否表明存在密切的进化关系？


否定句:
The structures are not homologous; they are analogous. = 这些结构不是同源的；它们是类似的。
The study did not reveal any significant homology between the species. = 这项研究没有揭示这些物种之间有任何显著的同源性。
