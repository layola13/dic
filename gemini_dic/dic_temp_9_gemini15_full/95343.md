incenter:/ˈɪnsɛntər/| n. |内心；内心点；内心圆|The point of concurrency of the angle bisectors of a triangle.  It is also the center of the inscribed circle (incircle) of the triangle. |例句：The incenter of an equilateral triangle is also its centroid, circumcenter, and orthocenter.|近义词：center, midpoint|反义词：circumcenter


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The incenter is located inside the triangle. = 内心位于三角形内部。
The incenter determines the incircle's radius. = 内心决定内切圆的半径。


一般过去时:
We calculated the incenter's coordinates. = 我们计算了内心的坐标。
The students found the incenter of the triangle. = 学生们找到了三角形的内心。


现在完成时:
They have determined the incenter's position. = 他们已经确定了内心的位置。
We have used the incenter to solve the geometry problem. = 我们已经利用内心来解决几何问题。


过去完成时:
They had already found the incenter before the presentation. = 他们在演示之前就已经找到了内心。
The students had calculated the incenter's coordinates by then. = 学生们那时已经计算出了内心的坐标。


将来时:
We will locate the incenter using the angle bisectors. = 我们将使用角平分线来确定内心。
They will calculate the incenter's distance from the vertices. = 他们将计算内心到顶点的距离。


虚拟语气:
If the triangle were equilateral, the incenter would be at the centroid. = 如果三角形是等边的，那么内心就在重心处。
I wish I knew how to easily find the incenter of this irregular triangle. = 我希望我知道如何轻松找到这个不规则三角形的内心。


被动语态:
The incenter was accurately calculated by the computer. = 内心被计算机精确计算出来。
The incenter's position is determined by the intersection of angle bisectors. = 内心的位置由角平分线的交点确定。


疑问句:
Where is the incenter located in this triangle? = 在这个三角形中，内心位于何处？
How do you find the incenter of a triangle? = 你如何找到三角形的内心？


否定句:
The point is not the incenter; it's the circumcenter. = 这个点不是内心；它是外心。
The calculation did not correctly determine the incenter's position. = 计算没有正确确定内心的位置。


PHRASE->
incenter coordinates = 内心坐标
incenter of a triangle = 三角形的内心
distance from incenter = 到内心的距离
incenter and circumcenter = 内心和外心
incenter theorem = 内心定理
