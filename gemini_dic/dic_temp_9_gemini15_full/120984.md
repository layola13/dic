miscibility:/ˌmɪsɪˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可混溶性，互溶性 | The ability of two or more liquids to mix together to form a homogeneous solution.  Miscibility is dependent on the intermolecular forces between the molecules of the liquids.  If the intermolecular forces are similar, the liquids are likely to be miscible. If they are significantly different, the liquids will likely be immiscible. | Example: The miscibility of water and ethanol is high, while the miscibility of oil and water is low. 水和乙醇的可混溶性很高，而油和水的可混溶性很低。|近义词：solubility (in the context of liquids), compatibility |反义词：immiscibility
