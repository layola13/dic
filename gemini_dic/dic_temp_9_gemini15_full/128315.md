neurotome:/ˈnʊroʊtoʊm/| n. |神经节|A neurotome is a segment of the developing embryo that gives rise to a spinal nerve and its associated structures, including muscles, skin, and other tissues.  It represents a basic unit of the body plan in vertebrates.  The neurotome develops from the neural tube and is involved in the formation of the peripheral nervous system.|The neurotome segments are crucial for the development of the somatic nervous system.|近义词：somite (although somites are more broadly defined)|反义词：无


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The neurotome develops from the neural tube. = 神经节由神经管发育而来。
Each neurotome gives rise to a spinal nerve. = 每个神经节都产生一条脊神经。


一般过去时:
Researchers studied the development of the neurotome. = 研究人员研究了神经节的发育。
The neurotome segments were clearly visible under the microscope. = 在显微镜下神经节节段清晰可见。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified the genes involved in neurotome formation. = 科学家们已经确定了参与神经节形成的基因。

过去完成时:
Before the experiment, the researchers had prepared the neurotome samples. = 在实验之前，研究人员已经准备好了神经节样本。
They had already observed the segmentation of the neurotome in earlier studies. = 他们在早期的研究中已经观察到神经节的分节现象。


将来时:
Future research will focus on the precise mechanisms of neurotome development. = 未来的研究将集中在神经节发育的精确机制上。
Scientists will continue to investigate the role of the neurotome in various diseases. = 科学家们将继续研究神经节在各种疾病中的作用。


虚拟语气:
If the neurotome development were disrupted, severe malformations could occur. = 如果神经节发育受到破坏，可能会发生严重的畸形。
It is hypothesized that if a certain gene were mutated, the neurotome formation would be affected. = 假设如果某个基因发生突变，神经节的形成就会受到影响。


被动语态:
The neurotome is formed during early embryonic development. = 神经节是在胚胎早期发育过程中形成的。
The structure of the neurotome has been extensively studied. = 神经节的结构已经被广泛研究。


疑问句:
What are the key factors influencing neurotome development? = 影响神经节发育的关键因素是什么？
How does the neurotome contribute to the formation of the peripheral nervous system? = 神经节如何促进周围神经系统的形成？


否定句:
The neurotome does not develop independently of other embryonic structures. = 神经节并非独立于其他胚胎结构而发育。
The study did not find any significant differences in neurotome formation between the two groups. = 该研究没有发现两组之间神经节形成的任何显著差异。
