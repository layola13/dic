/ˌkoʊˈproʊmoʊtər/| n. |协同启动子；共同启动子|A copromoter is a DNA sequence that enhances the transcription of a gene by working in conjunction with another promoter. It often involves two or more promoters that work together to regulate gene expression.  Copromoters can be located near or far from the gene they regulate. They are often found in operons, where multiple genes are transcribed together. | Example:  The research team identified a copromoter region that significantly increased the expression of the target gene.  研究团队发现了一个协同启动子区域，显著提高了目标基因的表达。|近义词：enhancer, upstream activating sequence (UAS)|反义词：repressor, silencer|名词
