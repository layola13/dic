词源:

The word "harangueful" is derived from the noun "harangue," meaning a long, angry, and critical speech.  The suffix "-ful" adds the meaning of "full of" or "characterized by," thus creating the adjective "harangueful."  The ultimate origin of "harangue" lies in the Old French word "harangue," which likely has Germanic roots.
