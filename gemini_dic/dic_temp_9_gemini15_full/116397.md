词源:
The word "masturbate" is derived from the Latin word "masturbatio," which itself has a complex and uncertain etymology.  Some theories suggest it originated from the Italian word "masturbazione," possibly related to the Italian word "mano" (hand).  However, the exact origin remains debated among etymologists.  The word entered English in the 18th century.
