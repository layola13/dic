词源:
The word "murder" comes from the Old French word "murderer," which ultimately derives from the Old Norse word "morðr," meaning "murder, death, killing."  The Old Norse word is related to the Old English word "morðor," which also meant "murder."  The -er suffix was added later to form the agent noun "murderer," and then the noun "murder" was subsequently derived from it.
