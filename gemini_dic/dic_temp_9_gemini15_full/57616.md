词源:

The word "draughtboard" is a compound word.  "Draught" comes from the Old English word *draught*, meaning "a draw," referring to the drawing of pieces in the game of draughts (checkers).  "Board" is from the Old English word *bord*, meaning a flat surface.  Thus, "draughtboard" literally means "a board for playing draughts."
