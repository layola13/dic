词源:

The word "cantankerousness" derives from "cantankerous," which itself has an uncertain etymology.  The most likely origin is from  a combination of Middle English "cantel" (meaning "corner" or "angle") and possibly "anker" (meaning "to anchor" or "to cling").  The resulting image is of something that is stubbornly fixed in its position, hence difficult or argumentative.  The "-ousness" suffix transforms the adjective "cantankerous" into a noun, indicating a state or quality.
