The word "hympne" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "hymn," "hem," or another word entirely?

2. **It's a neologism or very rare word:** It could be a newly coined word, a word from a very specialized field, or a word from a dialect or archaic language not widely used.  More context is needed.

3. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or place name.

Without more information or a corrected spelling, I cannot provide the requested analysis.  Please provide the correct spelling or more context.
