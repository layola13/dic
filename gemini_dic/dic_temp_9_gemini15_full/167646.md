词源:

The word "priceless" is a compound word formed from the prefix "price-" and the suffix "-less".  "Price" comes from Old French "pris," meaning "value, price," ultimately from Latin "pretium" with the same meaning.  "-less" is a common suffix in English indicating a lack of something, derived from Old English "-lēas."  Therefore, "priceless" literally means "without price."


用法说明:

虽然字面意思是“没有价格”，但通常表示某事物价值极高，无法用金钱衡量，强调的是其价值的非凡和不可替代性，而不是字面上的“没有价值”。  它通常用于形容艺术品、文物、经验、或个人关系等。
