词源:
The word "collectability" is derived from the noun "collection" and the suffix "-ability," which indicates capacity or potential.  "Collection" itself comes from the verb "collect," ultimately stemming from the Latin word "colligere," meaning "to gather together."  Therefore, "collectability" essentially means the capacity or potential to be collected and valued as a collectible item.
