词源:

The word "overswung" is a past participle of the verb "overswing," formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") to the verb "swing."  "Swing" itself has Old English roots, relating to movement and swaying. Therefore, "overswung" literally describes something that has swung too far.
