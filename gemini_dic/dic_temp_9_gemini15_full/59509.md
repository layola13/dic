eastness's:/ˈiːst.nəs.ɪz/| n. |东部性质；东方特征的复数形式|The term "eastness's" is grammatically unusual.  It appears to be an attempt to pluralize "eastness," which itself is a noun referring to the quality or state of being east or oriented towards the east.  However,  "eastness" is not typically pluralized.  A more correct way to express multiple instances of eastward characteristics would be to use "aspects of eastness" or similar phrasing.|例句：The artist's paintings captured different aspects of eastness.  这位艺术家的绘画作品捕捉到了东方特征的不同方面。|近义词：orientalism (in a cultural context), eastwardness|反义词：westness
