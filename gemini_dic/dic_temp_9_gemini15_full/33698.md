The word "{cion}" is not a valid English word.  There is no word in standard English dictionaries that uses this spelling.  Therefore, I cannot provide an analysis according to the requested format.  It's possible there's a misspelling or it's a word from a specialized field or a neologism (newly coined word).  If you can provide the correct spelling or more context, I can help.
