词源：
The word "enamel" comes from the Old French word "esmal," which itself is derived from the Latin word "smaltum," meaning "a kind of blue pigment."  The word's evolution reflects its early use in creating colored glazes, particularly blues, for pottery and metalwork.  Over time, the meaning broadened to encompass all types of hard, glassy coatings.
