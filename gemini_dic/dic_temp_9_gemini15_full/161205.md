词源:

The word is a combination of "post-" (meaning after or following) and "inflationary" (relating to inflation).  "Inflationary" itself derives from "inflation," which comes from the Latin word "inflatio," meaning "a swelling."  The concept of economic inflation developed over time, with the modern understanding solidifying in the 20th century.  Therefore, "postinflationary" is a relatively modern word reflecting this specific economic concept.
