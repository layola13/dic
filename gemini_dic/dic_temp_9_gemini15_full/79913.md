gneissoid:/ˈnaɪsoɪd/ | adj. | 片麻状的；似片麻岩的 | Resembling gneiss; having a banded texture.  The term describes a rock texture characterized by a parallel arrangement of mineral grains, often resulting in a layered or foliated appearance. This texture is similar to that found in gneiss, a metamorphic rock. | Example: The metamorphic rock exhibited a gneissoid banding, suggesting regional metamorphism.  这块变质岩呈现片麻状条带，表明发生了区域变质作用。|近义词：banded, foliated, schistose | 反义词：massive, unfoliated


USAGE->
This word is an adjective and doesn't have verb conjugations like "hello".  It describes the texture of a rock, and therefore doesn't follow typical verb tense structures.  The usage is descriptive.
