词源:

The word "outflanking" is derived from the verb "outflank," which combines the prefix "out-" (meaning "surpass" or "exceed") and the noun "flank" (referring to the side of a military formation or an area).  Therefore, it literally means "to surpass or exceed by attacking from the flank."  The military origin is evident in its usage.
