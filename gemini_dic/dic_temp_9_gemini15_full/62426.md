endoparasite:/ˌɛndoʊˈpærəsaɪt/| n. |内寄生虫|An endoparasite is a parasite that lives within the body of its host organism.  This contrasts with ectoparasites, which live on the external surface of the host. Endoparasites can inhabit various locations within the host, such as the digestive tract, circulatory system, or tissues.  They often have specialized adaptations for survival within the host's internal environment, including mechanisms for attachment, nutrient absorption, and evasion of the host's immune system.|Example: Tapeworms are a common example of an endoparasite, living in the intestines of their host and absorbing nutrients.|近义词：internal parasite|反义词：ectoparasite|名词
