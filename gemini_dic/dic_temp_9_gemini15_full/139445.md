词源:

The word "obsolescent" comes from the Latin word "obsolēscere," which means "to grow out of use," "to become obsolete."  It's a combination of the prefix "ob-" (meaning "away from" or "against") and the verb "solēre" (meaning "to be accustomed to" or "to be used to").  Therefore, the original meaning points to something that is moving away from being customary or usual.
