operant:/ˈɒpərənt/ /ˈɑːpərənt/| adj.| 操作的；起作用的；有效的 | Relating to or denoting a type of learning in which behavior is modified by its consequences. Operant conditioning is a learning process where behavior is strengthened if followed by a reinforcer or diminished if followed by a punisher.  | Example:  Operant conditioning is a powerful tool for shaping behavior. 操作性条件反射是塑造行为的有力工具。  The operant response was rewarded with a treat.  起作用的反应得到了奖励。|近义词：effective, functional, active |反义词：ineffective, inactive, dormant |
