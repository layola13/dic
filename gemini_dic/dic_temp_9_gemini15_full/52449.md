diedral:/ˈdaɪˌiːdrəl/| n. |二面角，二面体角|A dihedral angle is the angle between two intersecting planes.  It is measured as the angle between two lines, one in each plane, that are both perpendicular to the line of intersection of the planes.  Dihedral angles are used in various fields including chemistry (to describe the spatial arrangement of atoms in molecules), crystallography (to describe the angles between crystallographic planes), and geometry. |Example: The dihedral angle between the two planes of the molecule was measured to be 60 degrees.  二面体角的度数为60度。

The dihedral angle in this protein structure is crucial for its function.  这个蛋白质结构中的二面角对其功能至关重要。|近义词：interfacial angle |反义词：无
