词源:
The term "diamond-like" is a compound adjective formed from "diamond," referring to the gemstone, and "-like," a suffix indicating resemblance.  The word "diamond" originates from the Old French "diamant," ultimately derived from the Ancient Greek "ἀδάμας" (adámas), meaning "unbreakable" or "invincible," reflecting the exceptional hardness of the stone.
