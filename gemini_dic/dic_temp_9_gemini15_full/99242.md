词源:
The word "intercommonage" is a compound word formed from "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and "commonage" (meaning the right to use common land).  "Commonage" itself derives from "common" (shared land) and the suffix "-age" (signifying the right or act of).  Therefore, intercommonage literally refers to the shared right of using common land among multiple parties.
