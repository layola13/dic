rhizine:/ˈraɪziːn/| n. |假根；根状菌丝|A rhizine is a root-like filament found in certain lower plants, such as fungi and lichens, that serves to anchor the organism to a substrate.  It is not a true root, lacking the vascular tissue of roots. |Example: The lichen was firmly attached to the rock by numerous rhizines.  这地衣由许多假根牢牢地附着在岩石上。|近义词：holdfast, rootlet (in some contexts)|反义词：root (true root with vascular tissue)
