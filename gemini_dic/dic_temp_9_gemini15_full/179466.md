redusted: /rɪˈdʌstɪd/ | adj. | 重新除尘的；重新拂去灰尘的 |  The word "redusted" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It's likely a newly coined word or a misspelling.  It is formed by combining the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") and the past participle "dusted" (from the verb "to dust").  Therefore, it implies something has been dusted again, or had its dust removed a second time. | 例句：The antique furniture had been redusted for the exhibition.  = 古董家具为展览重新除尘了。 | 近义词：recleaned, re-cleaned, cleaned again | 反义词：dusty, dirty
