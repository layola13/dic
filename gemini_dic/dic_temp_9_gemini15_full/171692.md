pulvillio:/pʌlˈvɪliəʊ/| n. |吸垫；足垫|A pulvillus is a small, adhesive pad found on the feet of many insects and other arthropods.  These pads allow the insects to cling to smooth surfaces.  They are usually located between the claws and are composed of soft, hairy structures that secrete a sticky substance.|Example: The fly's pulvilli allowed it to walk upside down on the ceiling.  这只苍蝇的吸垫使它能够在天花板上倒立行走。|近义词：arolium (in some contexts)|反义词：无|


USAGE->

The researchers had hypothesized that the pulvilli played a crucial role in locomotion. = 研究人员曾假设吸垫在运动中起着至关重要的作用。


将来时:
We will examine the pulvilli's microstructure in detail. = 我们将详细检查吸垫的微观结构。
Scientists will further investigate the mechanism of adhesion of the pulvilli. = 科学家们将进一步研究吸垫的粘附机制。
