preromanticism:/ˌpriːˈroʊmænɪtɪzəm/| n. |前浪漫主义|Preromanticism refers to a transitional period in European art, literature, and music that bridges the late 18th century and the early 19th century.  It acts as a bridge between the Enlightenment and Romanticism, characterized by a growing emphasis on emotion, intuition, and the individual, but without the full-blown characteristics of Romanticism.  It foreshadows many of the key themes and styles that would define the Romantic movement. |The Sturm und Drang movement in German literature is a key example of preromanticism.  Many artists and writers of this period show a growing fascination with the natural world and a rejection of strict classical forms.|近义词：proto-romanticism, pre-romanticism |反义词：N/A
