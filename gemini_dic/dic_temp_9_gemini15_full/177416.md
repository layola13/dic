词源:
The word "rebalanced" is formed from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "anew") and the verb "balanced," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "balancer" (to sway, to swing).  The concept of balance itself has ancient roots, reflecting the fundamental importance of equilibrium in various aspects of life, from physical mechanics to financial markets.
