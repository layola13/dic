meiosis:/maɪˈoʊsɪs/| n. |减数分裂|The process of cell division in sexually reproducing organisms that reduces the number of chromosomes in the parent cell by half and produces four gametes (sex cells). This process is essential for sexual reproduction because it ensures that the offspring have the correct number of chromosomes.  |Example: Meiosis is crucial for the genetic diversity of offspring. 减数分裂对于后代的遗传多样性至关重要。|近义词：gametogenesis|反义词：mitosis
