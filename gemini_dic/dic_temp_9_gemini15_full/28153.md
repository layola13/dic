The word "caple" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* **It's a proper noun:**  It might be a name, place, or brand.
* **It's a neologism or slang:**  It could be a newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.
* **It's a regional dialect word:** It might be used in a specific geographic area.

To help me provide the analysis you need, please:

1. **Verify the spelling:** Make sure the word is correctly spelled.
2. **Provide context:** Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the source will help determine its meaning and usage.
