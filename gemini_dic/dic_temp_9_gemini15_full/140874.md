词源:

* **on:** preposition, indicating circumstance.
* **the:** definite article.
* **spur:** noun, originally referring to a pointed object used to urge a horse onward;  metaphorically, a sudden urge or impulse.  From Old French *esporon* and ultimately from Latin *spina* ("thorn").
* **of:** preposition, indicating origin or cause.
* **the:** definite article.
* **moment:** noun, a very brief period of time. From Latin *momentum* ("movement, impulse").

The phrase's meaning evolved from the literal image of acting on a sudden impulse, like a horse spurred into action, to the broader figurative meaning of impulsive action.
