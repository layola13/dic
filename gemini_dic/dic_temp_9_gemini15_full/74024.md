用法说明:

"Forwardly" is an adverb that modifies a verb, describing how an action is performed.  It implies a certain lack of tact or consideration, often suggesting an overly bold or presumptuous approach.  However, it can also simply mean "in a forward direction" or "early," depending on the context.


The word carries a slightly negative connotation when used to describe someone's behavior, suggesting they are perhaps too assertive or immodest.  In contrast, when describing a process or timing, the connotation is neutral.
