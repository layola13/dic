WORD ORIGIN->
The word "ill-fated" is a compound word.  "Ill" means bad or evil, and "fated" means destined or predetermined. The combination suggests something destined for misfortune.  "Fated" traces back to Old English "fæt" (fate), ultimately related to words like "weave" suggesting a predetermined course of events, a woven destiny.
