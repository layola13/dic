cirrigrade:/ˈsɪrɪɡreɪd/| adj.|纤毛运动的；纤毛爬行的| Relating to or characterized by locomotion by means of cilia.  Cirrigrade locomotion is common in many small aquatic organisms. |The cirrigrade movement of the ciliates was observed under the microscope. 纤毛虫的纤毛运动在显微镜下被观察到。| 近义词：ciliated, ciliary | 反义词：sessile (lacking locomotion)
