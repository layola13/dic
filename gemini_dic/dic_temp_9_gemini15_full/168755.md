prodeltaic:/ˌproʊˈdɛltɪk/| adj.|三角洲前缘的；前三角洲的|Relating to or characteristic of a prodelta, which is a gently sloping, fine-grained sediment deposit located at the seaward edge of a delta.  It's the area where the river's sediment load begins to be significantly affected by marine processes.|The prodeltaic sediments were characterized by their fine grain size and high organic content.|近义词：deltaic (but with a different location)|反义词：N/A
