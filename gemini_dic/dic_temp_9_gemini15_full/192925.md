WORD ORIGIN->
The word "seaworthinesses" is derived from "seaworthiness," which is a combination of:

* **sea:**  Old English *sǣ*, meaning "sea".
* **worthy:** Old English *wyrþe*, meaning "worth, value, deserving".  This combines with the suffix *-iness* to create the noun form, indicating a state or quality.  The suffix *-es* denotes the plural.

Therefore, "seaworthinesses" literally means "the multiple qualities or states of being worthy of the sea (fit for sea travel)."
