The word "gade" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a regional dialect word, or a word from another language.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), a more accurate analysis might be possible.
