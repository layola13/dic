endosperm:/ˈɛndoʊspɜːrm/| n. |胚乳|The nutritive tissue in a seed, formed from the fusion of a sperm nucleus with two polar nuclei during double fertilization. It provides nourishment for the developing embryo.|Example: The endosperm of corn kernels is a rich source of starch.|近义词:albumen|反义词:embryo

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The endosperm provides nutrients to the developing embryo. = 胚乳为发育中的胚胎提供营养。
The endosperm’s composition varies between different plant species. = 不同植物物种的胚乳成分各不相同。

一般过去时:
The endosperm nourished the seedling until it could photosynthesize. = 胚乳滋养幼苗，直到它能够进行光合作用。
Scientists analyzed the endosperm to determine its nutritional content. = 科学家分析了胚乳以确定其营养成分。

现在完成时:
Researchers have studied the endosperm's role in seed germination. = 研究人员已经研究了胚乳在种子萌发中的作用。
Botanists have identified various types of endosperm in different plants. = 植物学家已经鉴定了不同植物中各种类型的胚乳。

过去完成时:
The embryo had already consumed much of the endosperm before germination. = 在萌发之前，胚胎已经消耗了大部分胚乳。
The seed had lost most of its endosperm by the time it was discovered. = 当种子被发现时，它已经失去了大部分胚乳。

将来时:
Future research will explore the genetic control of endosperm development. = 未来的研究将探索胚乳发育的基因控制。
Scientists will analyze the endosperm to understand its impact on crop yield. = 科学家将分析胚乳以了解其对作物产量的影响。

虚拟语气:
If the endosperm were deficient, the seed would not germinate. = 如果胚乳不足，种子将无法萌发。
I wish we had a better understanding of endosperm development. = 我希望我们对胚乳发育有更好的了解。

被动语态:
The endosperm is used by the embryo as a food source. = 胚乳被胚胎用作食物来源。
The endosperm’s composition is being investigated by scientists. = 胚乳的成分正在被科学家们研究。

疑问句:
What is the function of the endosperm in seed development? = 胚乳在种子发育中的功能是什么？
What are the different types of endosperm found in plants? = 植物中有哪些不同类型的胚乳？

否定句:
The seed did not have a significant endosperm reserve. = 种子没有大量的胚乳储备。
This plant species does not produce a large endosperm. = 这种植物物种不产生大量的胚乳。


PHRASE->
endosperm development = 胚乳发育
endosperm transfer = 胚乳转移
endosperm cell = 胚乳细胞
endosperm formation = 胚乳形成
endosperm tissue = 胚乳组织
