词源:  Derived from "hawthorn," a thorny shrub or small tree belonging to the genus *Crataegus*.  The "-y" suffix adds an adjectival quality, meaning "full of" or "resembling."  Therefore, "hawthorny" literally means "resembling or full of hawthorn," extending to the thorny and potentially unpleasant connotations associated with the plant.
