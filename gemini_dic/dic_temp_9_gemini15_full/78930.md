词源:  The word "giraffoid" is a combination of "giraffe" and the suffix "-oid," which means "resembling" or "having the form of."  Thus, "giraffoid" literally means "giraffe-like." The term is relatively rare and primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly in paleontology and zoology, to describe features reminiscent of giraffes in other animals, both extant and extinct.
