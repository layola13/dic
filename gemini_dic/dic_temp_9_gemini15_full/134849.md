词源:  The word is a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "moderates" (referring to people who hold moderate views).  "Moderate" comes from the Latin word "moderatus," the past participle of "moderari," meaning "to restrain," "to regulate," or "to keep within bounds."  Therefore, "nonmoderates" describes those who are not restrained or regulated in their views, hence holding extreme positions.
