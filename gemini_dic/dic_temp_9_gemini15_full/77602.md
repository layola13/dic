词源:
The word "geek" originally referred to a performer in a circus or sideshow who would bite the heads off of live chickens or perform other unusual feats.  Its modern meaning, referring to a person with an intense interest in a particular subject, developed in the latter half of the 20th century.  The exact etymology of the original meaning is uncertain, but possible origins include the Dutch word "geck" (fool) or a variation of the archaic English word "geck" (a simpleton).  The shift in meaning reflects a change in cultural perception, where what was once considered strange or abnormal is now often celebrated as a form of expertise.
