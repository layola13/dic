词源:
The word "overarranging" is a relatively modern term, formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the verb "arranging" (meaning "putting things in order").  The root of "arrange" traces back to the Old French "arranger," itself deriving from the Latin "ad" (to) + "rangare" (to range or set in a row).
