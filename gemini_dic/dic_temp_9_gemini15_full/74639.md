词源:  The word is a compound of "free" and "enterprising."  "Free" signifies independence and lack of restraint. "Enterprising" derives from "enterprise," which comes from the Old French "entreprise" (undertaking), ultimately from the Latin "interprendere" (to undertake).  Thus, "free-enterprising" signifies undertaking ventures with freedom and initiative.
