pepsinogen:/pɛpˈsɪnədʒən/| n. |胃蛋白酶原|An inactive precursor of pepsin, a digestive enzyme.  Pepsinogen is secreted by chief cells in the stomach and converted to pepsin upon exposure to hydrochloric acid. |Example:  The chief cells in the stomach lining secrete pepsinogen, which is then activated to pepsin.|近义词：proenzyme, zymogen|反义词：pepsin


USAGE->
一般现在时:
Pepsinogen is secreted by chief cells. = 胃蛋白酶原由主细胞分泌。
The stomach produces pepsinogen. = 胃产生胃蛋白酶原。


一般过去时:
The researchers measured pepsinogen levels. = 研究人员测量了胃蛋白酶原的水平。
The patient's pepsinogen levels were low. = 病人的胃蛋白酶原水平低。


现在完成时:
Scientists have studied pepsinogen extensively. = 科学家们已经广泛研究了胃蛋白酶原。
We have found elevated pepsinogen in the sample. = 我们在样本中发现了升高的胃蛋白酶原。


过去完成时:
The pepsinogen had already been activated before the test. = 在测试之前，胃蛋白酶原已经被激活了。
They had suspected low pepsinogen levels. = 他们怀疑胃蛋白酶原水平低。


将来时:
We will analyze the pepsinogen sample tomorrow. = 我们明天将分析胃蛋白酶原样本。
The doctor will order a pepsinogen test. = 医生将下令进行胃蛋白酶原测试。


虚拟语气:
If the pepsinogen were activated, digestion would begin. = 如果胃蛋白酶原被激活，消化就会开始。
I wish I had known the pepsinogen levels earlier. = 我希望我早点知道胃蛋白酶原的水平。


被动语态:
Pepsinogen is converted to pepsin by hydrochloric acid. = 胃蛋白酶原被盐酸转化为胃蛋白酶。
The pepsinogen levels were carefully monitored. = 胃蛋白酶原的水平被仔细监测。


疑问句:
What is the role of pepsinogen in digestion? = 胃蛋白酶原在消化中的作用是什么？
Are pepsinogen levels affected by diet? = 胃蛋白酶原水平受饮食影响吗？


否定句:
The sample did not contain pepsinogen. = 样本不含胃蛋白酶原。
There was no significant change in pepsinogen levels. = 胃蛋白酶原水平没有显著变化。


PHRASE->
pepsinogen secretion = 胃蛋白酶原分泌
pepsinogen levels = 胃蛋白酶原水平
pepsinogen activation = 胃蛋白酶原激活
serum pepsinogen = 血清胃蛋白酶原
gastric pepsinogen = 胃胃蛋白酶原
