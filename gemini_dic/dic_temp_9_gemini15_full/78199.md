geothermometer:/ˌdʒioʊθɜːˈmɒmɪtər/| n. |地热温度计|A geothermometer is a method or instrument used to estimate the temperature of a geothermal system (e.g., a hydrothermal system) based on the chemical composition of its fluids or rocks.  It relies on the principle that certain chemical reactions and mineral equilibria are temperature-dependent. Different geothermometers utilize different chemical indicators and are applicable to various geological settings. |Example:  Geochemists used a silica geothermometer to estimate the subsurface temperature of the geothermal reservoir.  地化学家使用二氧化硅地热温度计来估算地热储层的地下温度。|近义词：geothermal indicator, temperature indicator|反义词：N/A
