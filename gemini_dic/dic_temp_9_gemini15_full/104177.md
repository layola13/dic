词源:
The word "junket" ultimately derives from the Old French word "jonchée," meaning a "rush mat" or a "bed of rushes."  Over time, the word evolved to refer to a sweet, creamy dessert served on such mats, and later, to any kind of feast or celebration. The modern meaning, referring to an often luxurious trip, especially one funded by public money, emerged later.
