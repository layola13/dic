词源:
The word "compensator" is derived from the verb "compensate," which comes from the Late Latin word "compensare," meaning "to weigh equally," "to make amends," or "to counterbalance."  The suffix "-ator" forms nouns denoting agents or instruments.  Therefore, "compensator" literally means "something that compensates."
