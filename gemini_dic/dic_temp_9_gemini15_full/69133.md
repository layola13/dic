词源:
Favoritism comes from the word "favor," meaning preferential treatment, which in turn is derived from the Old French "favor" and ultimately from the Latin "favor," meaning "kindness, goodwill, grace." The suffix "-ism" denotes a system, practice, or doctrine.  Therefore, favoritism signifies a system or practice of showing favor or preferential treatment.
