反义词：None directly opposite, but "healthy" could be considered an antonym in the context of periodontal health.


词源:  Derived from "periodontium" + "-ally".  "Periodontium" itself comes from Greek:  "peri-" (around) + "odous" (tooth) + "-ium" (tissue).  Thus, it literally means "around the tooth tissue".
