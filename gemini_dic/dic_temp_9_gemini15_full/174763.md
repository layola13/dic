词源:
The word "rabble-rouser" is a compound word.  "Rabble" refers to a disorderly crowd or mob, originating from the Old French word "rabable," meaning "trash" or "rubbish." "Rouser" means someone who stirs up or excites, derived from the verb "rouse," meaning to awaken or stir to action.  Therefore, a "rabble-rouser" literally means someone who stirs up a mob.
