nondarkest: /ˌnɒnˈdɑːrkɪst/ | adj. |非最黑暗的，不太黑暗的 |  This word is not a standard English word and lacks a formal definition in dictionaries. It's likely a newly coined word or a misspelling.  It appears to be formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") with "darkest" (the superlative form of "dark"). It suggests something that is not the darkest, implying a relatively less dark state or condition.  |Example: The nondarkest corner of the room still held a faint glimmer of light. (这房间最不黑暗的角落里仍然有一丝微光。) |近义词: less dark, dimmer, slightly illuminated |反义词: darkest, blackest
