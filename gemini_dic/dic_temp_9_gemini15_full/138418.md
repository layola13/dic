词源:
The word "what" originates from Old English *hwæt,  a combination of *hwa (who) and *æt (that).  Its usage has evolved over time, expanding from its original interrogative function to include exclamations and other uses.


用法说明:
"What" is one of the most common words in the English language.  It primarily functions as an interrogative pronoun, used to ask questions about things, situations, or qualities. It can also be used as an adjective, an exclamation, and even a noun in certain contexts. The specific meaning often depends on the context of the sentence.  As a pronoun, it can stand alone or be followed by nouns, clauses, or phrases.  As an adjective, it precedes a noun it modifies.  As an exclamation, it shows surprise, disbelief, or astonishment.
