词源:

The word "re-feeding" is a compound word formed from the prefix "re-" (meaning "again" or "back") and the verb "feeding" (the act of giving food).  Its use in the context of medical treatment is a relatively recent development, tied to the increased understanding of eating disorders and their treatment.
