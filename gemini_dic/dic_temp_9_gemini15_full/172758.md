quadratics:/kwɑːˈdrætɪks/ | n. | 二次方程式；二次曲线 |  Quadratics are mathematical equations where the highest power of the variable is two.  They are often expressed in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants and a ≠ 0.  Solving quadratic equations involves finding the values of x that satisfy the equation.  These values are called roots or solutions.  Quadratics can also represent curves called parabolas. | Example:  The equation x² + 3x + 2 = 0 is a quadratic equation.  The solutions are x = -1 and x = -2. | 近义词：quadratic equations | 反义词：linear equations (线性方程)
