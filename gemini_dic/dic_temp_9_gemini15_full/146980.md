The word "overjoyousness" is a relatively modern creation, formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or to a great degree) with the noun "joyousness" (meaning the state of being joyful).  "Joyousness" itself derives from "joy," ultimately from the Old French "joie" and the Latin "gaudium."
