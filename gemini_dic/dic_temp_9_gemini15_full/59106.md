词源:
The word "dyke" originates from the Middle Dutch word "dijke," meaning "dike" or "embankment."  Its later offensive use as a slur against lesbians emerged in the 20th century, likely associated with negative stereotypes and prejudices.  The shift in meaning and the negative connotations associated with the word are important to understand when using it.
