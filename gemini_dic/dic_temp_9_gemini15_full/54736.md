词源:  The adverb "disparagingly" is derived from the verb "disparage," which comes from the Old French word "desparager," meaning "to make unequal" or "to lower in rank."  This, in turn, has roots in the Latin prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart" or "away") and the word "par" (meaning "equal").  Thus, the original sense implied making something unequal or less than equal, leading to its modern meaning of belittling or disparaging.
