prion:/ˈpraɪɒn/| n. |朊病毒|A prion is an infectious agent composed primarily of protein.  Unlike most other infectious agents, such as viruses, bacteria, or fungi, prions do not contain any genetic material (DNA or RNA).  They cause a variety of fatal neurodegenerative diseases by inducing abnormal folding of normal cellular proteins.  The misfolded proteins then aggregate, forming plaques that damage brain tissue. |Prions are responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or "mad cow disease") in cattle, and scrapie in sheep.|近义词：infectious agent, pathogenic protein|反义词：无
