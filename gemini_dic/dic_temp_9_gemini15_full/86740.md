词源:

The word "helotry" derives from the ancient Greek word "helot" (ἥλωτος), which referred to the state-owned serfs of Sparta.  The exact etymology of "helot" is debated, but some theories suggest it might be connected to words meaning "captured" or "taken prisoner."  The suffix "-ry" indicates a state or condition.
