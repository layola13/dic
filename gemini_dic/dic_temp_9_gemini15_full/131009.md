/ˌnɒnəˈtrɪbjʊtɪvnəsɪz/ | n. | 非属性性；非归属性 | The word "nonattributivenesses" refers to the instances or qualities of lacking attributiveness.  Attributiveness, in linguistics, refers to the capacity of a word or phrase to function as an attribute or modifier of another word or phrase.  Therefore, nonattributivenesses are situations where this modifying capacity is absent. This is a very uncommon and potentially awkward word; it's much more likely to encounter discussions of "lack of attributiveness" or similar phrasing. |  The abstract nature of "nonattributivenesses" makes it difficult to provide concrete examples in a simple sentence.  Its usage would be highly specialized, likely within linguistic analysis. For instance, one might discuss "the nonattributivenesses of certain prepositional phrases in this corpus." |  N/A (due to rarity and specialized usage) | N/A (due to rarity and specialized usage) | noun
