phosphonium:/fɒsˈfoʊniəm/| n. | 鏻 | A positively charged polyatomic ion consisting of a phosphorus atom bonded to four alkyl or aryl groups.  It's a type of phosphine derivative where the phosphorus atom has a positive charge due to the four bonds.  Phosphonium salts are commonly used as catalysts and reagents in organic chemistry. | Example: Tetraphenylphosphonium bromide is a common phosphonium salt used as a phase-transfer catalyst.  四苯基溴化鏻是一种常用的作为相转移催化剂的鏻盐。| 近义词:  (None directly equivalent, as it's a specific ion) | 反义词: (None directly opposite, but its counterions in salts could be considered opposites depending on the context)|  名词

词源:

The word "phosphonium" is derived from "phosphorus" (磷),  the nonmetal element, and the suffix "-onium," which is used to denote a positively charged ion.  The "-onium" suffix indicates a cationic species.  The word reflects the chemical composition of the ion, indicating a phosphorus atom at its core.
