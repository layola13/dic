词源:
The word "gurdwara" comes from the Punjabi words "gur" (गुरु), meaning "teacher" or "guru," and "dwara" (द्वारा), meaning "door" or "gateway."  Therefore, gurdwara literally means "the gateway to the guru" or "the guru's door."  It signifies the place where one can approach and connect with the Guru.
