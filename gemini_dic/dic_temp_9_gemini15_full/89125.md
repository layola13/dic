词源:
The word "homestead" comes from the Middle English word "homestud," meaning "home-place" or "manor house."  The "-stead" element is an Old English suffix indicating a place or location.  The modern usage, especially related to land acquisition in the American West, developed in the 19th century with the Homestead Acts.
