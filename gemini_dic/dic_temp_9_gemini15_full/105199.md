keyframe:/ˈkiːfreɪm/| n. |关键帧|A keyframe is a single image in a sequence of images that defines the start and/or end point of an animation or transition.  It represents a specific point in time within the animation, and the software interpolates (fills in) the frames between keyframes to create the illusion of movement.  In essence, keyframes are the anchor points for animation. |Example:  The animator meticulously placed keyframes to create a smooth, realistic walk cycle.  动画师精心放置关键帧以创建流畅逼真的行走循环。|近义词：anchor point, pivotal frame |反义词：intermediate frame
