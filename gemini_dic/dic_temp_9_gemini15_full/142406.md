The word "orvietan" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide a response in the requested format.  It's possible that this is a misspelling, a proper noun specific to a certain field, or a neologism (newly coined word).  More context is needed to determine its possible meaning and usage.
