词源:
The term "metaverse" is a portmanteau of "meta" (meaning beyond or transcending) and "universe."  It was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 science fiction novel *Snow Crash*.  The prefix "meta" suggests a level of reality beyond the typical physical universe, while "universe" indicates a comprehensive and all-encompassing space.  The combination creates a term denoting a virtual reality environment that acts as a comprehensive and advanced digital world.
