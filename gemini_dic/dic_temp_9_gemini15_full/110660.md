词源:  The word "lincture" ultimately derives from the Latin word "linctus," meaning "something licked," referring to the manner of administering the medicine.  The suffix "-ure" is a noun-forming suffix.  Therefore, the original sense implies a medicine to be licked or swallowed in small quantities.
