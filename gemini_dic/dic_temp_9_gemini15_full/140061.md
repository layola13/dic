词源：

The word is derived from "oestrogen" (or "estrogen" in American English),  a hormone primarily responsible for the development and regulation of the female reproductive system, plus the suffix "-ically," which creates an adverbial or adjectival form indicating "in a manner of" or "relating to."  "Oestrogen" itself originates from the Greek words "oestrus" (meaning "frenzy" or "heat," referring to the female animal's estrous cycle) and "-gen" (meaning "producing" or "generating").
