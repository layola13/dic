词源:

The word "flabbergasted" is a relatively recent addition to the English language, emerging in the late 19th or early 20th century.  Its etymology is somewhat uncertain, but the most widely accepted theory connects it to the Dutch word "flabbergasten," meaning "to stun" or "to amaze."  The "flab" element likely relates to a sense of being "limp" or "flabby" with surprise, while "gast" is connected to the Dutch word "gast," meaning "guest"—suggesting the idea of a guest being so surprised they are rendered speechless or inactive.  The word's evolution involved a blending of Dutch and English elements, with the final "-ed" suffix indicating the past participle form of a verb, solidifying its use as an adjective.
