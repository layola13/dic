词源:  The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "exploitative," which is derived from the verb "exploit." "Exploit" comes from the Old French word "exploiter," meaning "to utilize," "to make use of," or "to utilize for gain."  The modern sense of exploitation, carrying the connotation of unfair advantage, developed later.
