词源:
The word "epithumetical" derives from the Greek word "epithalamium," meaning "a song or poem sung at a wedding."  While the original meaning was specific to wedding songs, the word evolved to describe anything characterized by the concise and memorable quality often found in such celebratory verses.  The "-ical" suffix transforms the noun into an adjective.
