词源:

non-  (否定前缀) + accumulative (累积的) + -ness (名词后缀) + -es (复数后缀)

`non-` is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of".
`accumulative` derives from the verb "accumulate,"  meaning "to gather or acquire an increasing number or quantity of something."  This in turn comes from the Latin word "accumulare," formed from "ad-" (to) + "cumulus" (heap).
`-ness` is a suffix that turns adjectives into nouns, indicating a state, quality, or condition.
`-es` is the plural suffix for nouns ending in "-s," "-sh," "-ch," "-x," or "-z".


Therefore,  "nonaccumulativenesses" refers to the multiple instances or aspects of something *not* accumulating or having the quality of not accumulating.  It's a relatively uncommon word, mostly found in scientific or technical contexts.
