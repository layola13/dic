/ˌɪntərˈsæmplɪŋ/| n. |样本间采样，内插采样|The process of obtaining data points between existing data points in a discrete data set.  This is often used in signal processing to reconstruct a continuous signal from a discrete representation.  It involves estimating the values of the signal at intermediate points based on the known values. |Example: Intersampling is crucial in digital audio processing to create a smoother and higher-quality sound.|近义词：resampling, interpolation|反义词：downsampling


USAGE->
