The word "reparks" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need clarification on the intended word.  Is it a misspelling of another word?  If so, please provide the correct spelling.
