The word "sledger" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, definition, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide the requested analysis in the specified format.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a regional dialect word, or a word from a specific context (like a fictional work).  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I may be able to offer a more helpful response.
