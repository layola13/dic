词源:
The word "consult" comes from the Old French word "consulter," which in turn derives from the Latin word "consulere," meaning "to deliberate, take counsel, advise."  The Latin root further breaks down into "con-" (together) and "sulere" (to be accustomed, to be wont).  Thus, the original sense implies a coming together to deliberate or advise.
