petawatt:/ˈpɛtəˌwɒt/|/ˈpɛtəˌwɑːt/| n. |拍瓦，千万亿瓦|A petawatt (PW) is a unit of power equal to 10^15 watts (one quadrillion watts).  It's used to measure extremely high power levels, often in the context of astrophysics or theoretical energy production.|The sun's total power output is approximately 3.828 × 10^26 watts, or 382.8 yottawatts (YW), which is equivalent to 382,800,000,000,000 petawatts.|近义词：None (it's a specific unit)|反义词：None (it's a unit of measurement)|名词
