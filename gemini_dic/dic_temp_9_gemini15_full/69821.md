ferrate:/ˈfɛreɪt/ | n. |铁酸盐；铁酸酯 |A ferrate is a salt or ester of ferriate acid (HFeO₄).  Ferrates are characterized by the presence of iron in the +6 oxidation state. They are strong oxidizing agents and have potential applications in water treatment and other areas. | Example: Potassium ferrate(VI) is a powerful oxidant used in wastewater treatment.  钾铁酸盐(VI)是一种用于废水处理的强氧化剂。| 近义词：ferriate (less common)| 反义词：无直接反义词
