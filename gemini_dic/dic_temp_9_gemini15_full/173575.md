词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost."  It indicates something that resembles something else but isn't exactly the same.

* **identically**: From "identical," meaning exactly the same; from Latin *identica* (feminine of *identicos*), from *idem* ("the same").  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb.
