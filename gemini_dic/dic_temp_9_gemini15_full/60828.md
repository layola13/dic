词源:

* **electro-**:  From Greek *elektron*, meaning "amber," referring to static electricity.
* **retino-**: From Greek *retina*, meaning "net," referring to the retina of the eye.
* **-graphy**: From Greek *-graphia*, meaning "writing" or "recording."

Therefore, electroretinography literally means "the recording of the electrical activity of the retina."
