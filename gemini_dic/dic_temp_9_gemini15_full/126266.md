myeloidin: /ˈmaɪəlɔɪdɪn/ | n. |骨髓素|A substance found in bone marrow, the exact nature and function of which are not fully understood.  Research suggests potential roles in hematopoiesis (blood cell formation) and immune regulation, but more investigation is needed.  |例句：The researchers are studying the effects of myeloidin on hematopoietic stem cells. 研究人员正在研究骨髓素对造血干细胞的影响。|近义词：There are no established direct synonyms as the substance is not fully characterized.|反义词：N/A|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The bone marrow produces myeloidin. = 骨髓产生骨髓素。
Scientists study the function of myeloidin. = 科学家研究骨髓素的功能。


一般过去时:

They had already analyzed the myeloidin samples before presenting their findings. = 他们在提交研究结果之前就已经分析了骨髓素样本。


将来时:
Further research will elucidate the precise function of myeloidin. = 进一步的研究将阐明骨髓素的确切功能。

被动语态:
Myeloidin was first isolated in [Year]. = 骨髓素首次分离于[年份]。
The properties of myeloidin are being actively studied. = 骨髓素的特性正在积极研究中。


疑问句:
What is the precise role of myeloidin in immune regulation? = 骨髓素在免疫调节中的确切作用是什么？
How does myeloidin influence hematopoiesis? = 骨髓素如何影响造血？


否定句:
Myeloidin is not yet fully understood. = 骨髓素尚未被完全理解。
The function of myeloidin is not completely clear. = 骨髓素的功能尚不清楚。


PHRASE->
Myeloidin concentration=骨髓素浓度
Myeloidin extraction=骨髓素提取
Myeloidin analysis=骨髓素分析
Myeloidin synthesis=骨髓素合成
Myeloidin levels=骨髓素水平
