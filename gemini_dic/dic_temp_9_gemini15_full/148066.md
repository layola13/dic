词源:

The word "oversanguinenesses" is derived from:

* **over-**:  A prefix indicating excess or too much.
* **sanguine**:  An adjective meaning cheerfully optimistic, hopeful, or confident.  It originates from the Latin word "sanguis," meaning "blood," as it was believed in ancient times that a ruddy complexion (indicative of good blood flow) was a sign of health and optimism.
* **-ness**: A suffix forming nouns of state, condition, or quality.  It transforms the adjective "sanguine" into the noun "sanguineness," meaning "optimism."
* **-es**: Plural suffix, indicating multiple instances of over-sanguineness.


Therefore, "oversanguinenesses" refers to multiple instances or aspects of excessive optimism or overconfidence.
