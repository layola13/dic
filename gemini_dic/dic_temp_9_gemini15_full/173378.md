词源:

The word is a combination of "quasi-" and "doubtful."

* **quasi-**:  This prefix, derived from Latin "quasi" meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly," indicates something that resembles or has the characteristics of something else but is not entirely or strictly that thing.

* **doubtful**: This word comes from the Old English "duhtfull," meaning "full of doubt."  It reflects the inherent uncertainty or lack of conviction.
