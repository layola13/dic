The word "prezzes" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a regional dialect word, a neologism, or a proper noun.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  To help, please provide context where you encountered this word.  Possible explanations include:


* **Misspelling:** It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you be thinking of "presses" (meaning to exert force, printing machines, or to urge strongly)? Or perhaps another word entirely?

* **Regional Dialect:**  Some words are used only in specific regions or communities.  Knowing the geographical origin of the word would be helpful.

* **Neologism (newly coined word):**  It could be a recently invented word, not yet included in dictionaries.  Again, context is essential.

* **Proper Noun:** It could be a name or a brand name.
