/ˈrʊrbæk/| n. |鲁尔巴赫（姓氏） |Roorbach is a surname of German origin.  It is likely a topographic name for someone who lived near a stream or brook, derived from the Middle High German *rur, meaning "brook" or "stream," combined with the suffix *-bach, also meaning "brook" or "stream."  Therefore, the name might literally translate to "brook brook" or "stream stream," which is somewhat redundant, suggesting a particularly prominent or noteworthy stream. The meaning could also be more nuanced, perhaps indicating a location characterized by multiple streams or a particularly significant stream. |The Roorbach family has a long history, with branches in various countries.  |近义词:|  (无直接近义词，因其为专有名词)|反义词:| (无)|名词
