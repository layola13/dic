The word "quellable" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's not possible to provide a detailed analysis with pronunciation, parts of speech, meaning, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., following the requested format.  It might be a misspelling, a newly coined word, or a word from a specific jargon or dialect.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer some speculation about its intended meaning.
