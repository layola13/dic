近义词：passionate, intimate, sensual, deeply connected | 反义词：Platonic, purely intellectual, superficial


词源: The term is a compound word formed from "post-" (meaning "after" or "beyond") and "Platonic" (referring to the philosophy of Plato, particularly his concept of idealized love as purely spiritual and non-physical).  The word emerged as a way to describe relationships that incorporate elements of both Platonic and non-Platonic ideals.
