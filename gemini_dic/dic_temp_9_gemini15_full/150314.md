pangeometry:/ˌpænˈdʒiːəmɪtri/| n. |泛几何学|The study of geometries beyond Euclidean geometry, encompassing various non-Euclidean geometries and other systems of geometry.|Example: Pangeometry explores geometries where parallel lines can intersect or where the sum of angles in a triangle is not 180 degrees.|近义词:higher geometry,generalized geometry|反义词:Euclidean geometry


USAGE->
This word is a relatively specialized term and doesn't lend itself to the same range of grammatical constructions as common words like "what."  The following examples showcase its use in declarative and interrogative sentences, reflecting its typical academic context.

Declarative Sentences:
This research project focuses on the principles of pangeometry. = 这个研究项目专注于泛几何学的原理。

The professor lectured on the different models within pangeometry. = 教授讲授了泛几何学中不同的模型。


Interrogative Sentences:
Does this theorem hold true in all systems of pangeometry? = 这个定理在所有泛几何体系中都成立吗？

What are the fundamental axioms of pangeometry? = 泛几何学的基本公理是什么？


PHRASE->
