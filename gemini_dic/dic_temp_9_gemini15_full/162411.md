preadherent: /ˌpriːˈædɪərənt/ | adj. | 预先粘附的，预先结合的 |  Describes something that is attached or bonded before a main process or event.  It often implies a preparatory step or a pre-existing condition.  | Example: The preadherent cells formed a layer before the main cell culture began.  预先粘附的细胞在主要的细胞培养开始之前形成了一层。 | 近义词: preattached, prebound, preliminary bonded | 反义词: post-adherent, unattached


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The preadherent molecules are essential for the process. = 预先粘附的分子对于该过程至关重要。
This preadherent layer facilitates cell growth. = 这层预先粘附的层促进了细胞生长。


一般过去时:
The preadherent cells were observed under a microscope. = 预先粘附的细胞在显微镜下观察。

现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several types of preadherent proteins. = 研究人员已经鉴定了几种类型的预先粘附蛋白。
The team has successfully tested the preadherent material. = 该团队已经成功测试了预先粘附的材料。


过去完成时:
The cells had already become preadherent before the experiment started. = 在实验开始之前，细胞已经预先粘附了。
They had prepared the preadherent surface in advance. = 他们事先准备好了预先粘附的表面。


将来时:
The new material will be preadherent to the surface. = 新材料将预先粘附到表面。
Scientists will investigate the properties of preadherent layers. = 科学家们将研究预先粘附层的特性。


虚拟语气:
If the cells were preadherent, the experiment would be more successful. = 如果细胞是预先粘附的，实验将会更成功。
It is important that the surface be preadherent before cell seeding. = 在细胞接种之前，表面预先粘附非常重要。


被动语态:
The substrate was prepared to be preadherent. = 基质被制备成预先粘附的。
The preadherent layer is being studied extensively. = 预先粘附层正在被广泛研究。


疑问句:
Are the cells already preadherent? = 细胞已经预先粘附了吗？
Is the preadherent treatment necessary? = 预先粘附处理是必要的吗？


否定句:
The cells were not yet preadherent. = 细胞尚未预先粘附。
The surface was not properly preadherent. = 表面没有正确地预先粘附。


PHRASE->
preadherent cells = 预先粘附细胞
preadherent layer = 预先粘附层
preadherent molecules = 预先粘附分子
preadherent substrate = 预先粘附基质
preadherent treatment = 预先粘附处理


词源:
The word "preadherent" is a combination of the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and the adjective "adherent" (meaning "sticking to something").  Therefore, it literally means "sticking before" or "attached beforehand".
