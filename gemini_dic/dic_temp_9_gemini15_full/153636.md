pentene:/ˈpɛnˌtiːn/| n. |戊烯|Pentene refers to any of several isomers of alkene hydrocarbons with the chemical formula C5H10.  These isomers differ in the position of the double bond and/or the arrangement of the carbon atoms (e.g., straight chain vs. branched chain).  They are colorless, volatile liquids with characteristic hydrocarbon odors.  Pentenes are used primarily as intermediates in the chemical industry for the production of various chemicals and polymers. |例句：1-Pentene is a common monomer used in the production of polyethylene. 一戊烯是生产聚乙烯的常用单体。

例句：The mixture contained several isomers of pentene, requiring careful separation. 该混合物包含几种戊烯异构体，需要仔细分离。|近义词：alkene, olefin (general terms)|反义词：无 (no direct antonym, as it's a specific chemical)|词性：noun


USAGE->
(Pentene itself is not a verb, adjective, or used in typical grammatical tenses like "hello".  Its usage is primarily within the context of chemistry and chemical engineering.)

PHRASE->
(Phrases involving "pentene" are highly specialized to chemistry and would not be common in everyday language. Examples would relate to specific reactions, processes, or chemical properties.)  For example:  "pentene polymerization", "1-pentene isomerization", "pentene oxidation".
