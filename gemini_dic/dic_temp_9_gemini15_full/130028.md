non-osmotic: /ˌnɒnɒzˈmɒtɪk/ | adj. |非渗透性的；非渗透压的 | Not involving or relating to osmosis.  Describes a process or substance that does not cause or involve the movement of water across a semipermeable membrane due to differences in solute concentration. | Example: The non-osmotic drug delivery system ensures targeted release of the medication.  非渗透性药物递送系统确保药物的靶向释放。|近义词：non-diffusive, impermeable (in the context of water movement)|反义词：osmotic

否定句:
The solution is not non-osmotic; it's osmotic. = 该溶液不是非渗透性的；它是渗透性的。
The process is not entirely non-osmotic. = 该过程并非完全是非渗透性的。


PHRASE->
non-osmotic drug delivery = 非渗透性药物递送
non-osmotic pressure = 非渗透压
non-osmotic hydration = 非渗透性水合作用
non-osmotic volume expansion = 非渗透性容积扩张
non-osmotic transport = 非渗透性转运


词源:
The word is a combination of "non-" (meaning "not") and "osmotic" (relating to osmosis).  Osmosis itself comes from the Greek word "osmos," meaning "push" or "impulse," reflecting the pressure driving the movement of water across a membrane.
