词源:  The word "secondsightedness" is a combination of "second sight" (a term referring to the ability to see beyond the ordinary) and the suffix "-ness," which indicates a state or quality.  "Second sight" itself likely derives from older beliefs in a "second sight" or "second vision" separate from ordinary perception.  The exact etymological roots are complex and interwoven with folklore and belief systems.
