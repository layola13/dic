gyroscopes:/ˈdʒaɪrəˌskoʊps/ | n. |陀螺仪，回转仪 | A gyroscope is a spinning wheel or disc in a frame that is free to turn in any direction.  It maintains its orientation regardless of the movement of the frame.  Gyroscopes are used in many applications, including navigation systems, stabilizing devices, and toys. | Example: The airplane uses gyroscopes to maintain its balance. 这架飞机使用陀螺仪来保持平衡。  The spinning top is a simple type of gyroscope. 旋转的陀螺是一种简单的陀螺仪。|近义词：stabilizer, rotator |反义词：None
