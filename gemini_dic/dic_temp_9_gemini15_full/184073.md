词源:
The word "resignation" comes from the Old French word "resignacion," which itself derives from the Latin word "resignatio."  "Re-" is a prefix meaning "again" or "back," and "signatio" is related to "signare," meaning "to sign" or "to seal."  Thus, the original meaning implied a "signing back" or a relinquishing of something previously held, like a position or a claim.  Over time, the meaning narrowed to specifically refer to the act of leaving a job.
