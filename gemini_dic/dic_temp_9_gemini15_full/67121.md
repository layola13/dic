exponentials:/ˌɛkspəˈnɛnʃəlz/| n.|指数，指数函数|Exponential functions describe quantities that increase or decrease at a rate proportional to their current value.  They are characterized by a constant base raised to a variable exponent.  Exponentials are fundamental in various fields, including mathematics, physics, finance, and biology. |例句：The growth of bacteria follows an exponential curve. 细菌的生长遵循指数曲线。

例句：Understanding exponentials is crucial for comprehending compound interest. 理解指数函数对于理解复利至关重要。


近义词：powers, indices|反义词：logarithms
