planarity:/plæˈnærəti/ | n. |平面性；平面度|The property of being planar; the state or quality of being flat or two-dimensional.  It refers to the ability of a graph to be embedded in a plane without any edges crossing. In geometry, it describes the flatness of a surface. In graph theory, it signifies the ability of a graph's representation to be drawn on a plane without edge crossings. |Example: The planarity of the circuit design is crucial for its manufacturability.  电路设计的平面性对其可制造性至关重要。 The planarity of a graph is a significant factor in determining its algorithmic complexity. 图的平面性是决定其算法复杂度的重要因素。|近义词：flatness, two-dimensionality |反义词：non-planarity, three-dimensionality |名词
