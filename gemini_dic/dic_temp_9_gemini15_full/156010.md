photolithographer:/ˌfoʊtoʊlɪˈθɑːɡrəfər/| n. |光刻技师，光刻员|A photolithographer is a skilled technician who uses photolithographic techniques to create microelectronic circuits and other micro-fabricated devices. They operate sophisticated equipment and follow precise procedures to transfer patterns onto silicon wafers, a crucial step in semiconductor manufacturing.  |Example: The experienced photolithographer meticulously aligned the mask to ensure the precise transfer of the circuit pattern onto the wafer.  经验丰富的光刻技师一丝不苟地调整掩膜版，以确保电路图案精确地转移到晶圆上。|近义词：microfabrication technician, lithographer |反义词：N/A
