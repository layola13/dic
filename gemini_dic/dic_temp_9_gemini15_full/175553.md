词源:  The word "rancour" comes from the Old French word "rancor," which itself derives from the Vulgar Latin "rancorem," a noun formed from the verb "rancere," meaning "to grow rancid" or "to become sour."  This reflects the idea of a feeling that has become bitter and unpleasant over time, similar to spoiled food.
