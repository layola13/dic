词源:
The word "citrus" comes from the Old French word "citron," which itself is derived from the Arabic word "limun," meaning "lemon."  The Arabic word ultimately traces back to the Persian word "līmu," also meaning "lemon."  The widespread cultivation and trade of citrus fruits, particularly lemons, throughout the Middle East and beyond, accounts for the spread of the word across various languages.
