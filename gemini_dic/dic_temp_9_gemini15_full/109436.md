The word "leops" is not a recognized word in standard English.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?
* **A neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or a term used within a specific community or context.  If this is the case, please provide more context.
* **A proper noun:**  Possibly a name, place, or abbreviation.  Again, more context is needed.

Please provide more information so I can assist you accurately.
