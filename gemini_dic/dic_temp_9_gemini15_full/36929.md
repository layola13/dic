词源:

The word "colossus" comes from the Greek word "κόλοσσος" (kolossos), which referred to a large statue, particularly the bronze statue of the sun god Helios in Rhodes, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.  The Greek word itself may be related to the verb "κολλοῦμαι" (kolloumai), meaning "I am mutilated," suggesting perhaps an association with a large, imposing, and perhaps somewhat flawed or incomplete figure.
