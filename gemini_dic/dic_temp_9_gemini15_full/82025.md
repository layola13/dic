Etymology:

The word "grippingnesses" is derived from the adjective "gripping," meaning "exciting and holding one's attention."  "Gripping" itself comes from the verb "to grip," meaning "to hold firmly."  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective into a noun, indicating a quality or state.  The final "-es" adds the plural marker.  Therefore, "grippingnesses" refers to multiple instances or aspects of something being gripping or exciting.
