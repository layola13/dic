The word "impenitencies" is derived from the word "impenitent," which itself comes from the Latin word "impœnitens," meaning "not repenting."  The prefix "im" means "not," and "pœnitens" is the present participle of "pœnitet," meaning "it causes regret."  The suffix "-cies" indicates a plural noun form.
