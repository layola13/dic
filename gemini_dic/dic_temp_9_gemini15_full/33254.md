chronotropic:/ˌkroʊnəˈtrɒpɪk/ | adj. | 影响心率的；变时性的 | Affecting the heart rate; relating to or causing a change in the rate of the heart.  | Example:  The drug had a chronotropic effect, increasing the heart rate. 这药物对心率有影响，使其加快。 |近义词:  tachycardic (if increasing heart rate), bradycardic (if decreasing heart rate) | 反义词:  (depending on context) -  chronolytic (if referring to inhibiting a heart rate change)


词源:

* **chrono-**:  From Greek *χρόνος* (chronos), meaning "time."
* **-tropic**: From Greek *τρέπειν* (trepein), meaning "to turn" or "to change."  In this context, it signifies "affecting" or "influencing."

Therefore, "chronotropic" literally means "time-turning" or "time-changing," referring to its effect on the timing or rate of the heart's contractions.


用法说明:

Chronotropic effects are often categorized as positive or negative:

* **Positive chronotropic effect:** Increases heart rate.  For example,  sympathetic nervous system stimulation has a positive chronotropic effect.

* **Negative chronotropic effect:** Decreases heart rate. For example, parasympathetic nervous system stimulation has a negative chronotropic effect.

The term is commonly used in pharmacology, cardiology, and physiology to describe the influence of substances or stimuli on heart rate.  It's an adjective, not a noun or verb.  It modifies nouns describing things that affect the heart rate, such as "effect," "agent," or "drug."
