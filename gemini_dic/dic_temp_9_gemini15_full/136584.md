The word "nonsalvations" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism (newly coined word), a misspelling, or a word from a very specialized or fictional context.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide a response in the requested format would be misleading and inaccurate.
