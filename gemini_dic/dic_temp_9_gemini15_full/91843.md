PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "hyperhilariously".  The word itself functions as a standalone intensifier.


词源:

The word is a combination of:

* **hyper-:**  A prefix meaning "excessive," "over," or "beyond."  It comes from Greek ὑπέρ (hupér).
* **hilariously:** An adverb meaning "in a hilariously funny manner."  "Hilarious" derives from "hilarious" (adjective), ultimately connected to "hill" (Old English *hyll*) possibly through a sense of "joyful exhilaration" associated with hills.  The exact etymological link is debated and not completely clear.

Therefore, "hyperhilariously" means "excessively hilariously," emphasizing the extreme degree of humor.
