integrability: /ˌɪntɪɡrəˈbɪləti/ | n. | 可积性，可整合性 | The quality or state of being integrable; the property of a function or system that allows it to be integrated.  Integrability refers to the ability of a mathematical object (like a function or a differential form) to be integrated.  In physics, it often refers to the ability of a system to be described by a Hamiltonian, which then allows for the application of various conservation laws and other powerful tools. | Example:  The integrability of the function depends on its behavior at infinity.  可积性取决于函数在无穷大处的行为。  The integrability of the system is crucial for determining its long-term stability.  系统的可积性对于确定其长期稳定性至关重要。 | 近义词：integrability condition (可积性条件) | 反义词：non-integrability (不可积性)


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in mathematical and physical contexts and doesn't have common verb conjugations like "hello."  The grammatical usage revolves around its use as a noun.

Example sentences demonstrating noun usage in different contexts:

Simple Present: The integrability of this equation is currently under investigation. 这个方程的可积性目前正在研究中。
Simple Past: The researchers proved the integrability of the model. 研究人员证明了该模型的可积性。

Present Perfect: We have confirmed the integrability of the system. 我们已经证实了系统的可积性。
Past Perfect: They had already established the integrability before the conference. 他们在会议之前就已经确定了可积性。

Future Simple:  We will investigate the integrability of the new function next week. 我们下周将研究新函数的可积性。
Future Perfect: They will have completed the analysis of the integrability by the end of the year. 他们将在年底完成可积性分析。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases directly using "integrability." Its usage is highly technical.  However, we can illustrate related concepts:

condition of integrability: 可积性条件
proof of integrability: 可积性证明
loss of integrability: 可积性损失
problem of integrability: 可积性问题
study of integrability: 可积性研究

词源:

The word "integrability" is derived from the verb "integrate," which comes from the Latin word "integrare," meaning "to make whole" or "to restore."  The mathematical concept of integration is related to finding the area under a curve, essentially "making whole" the area.  The suffix "-ability" indicates the capacity or potential for being integrated.
