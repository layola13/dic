词源:  The word "harlot" ultimately derives from the Old French word *harlot*, which itself comes from the Old Norse word *herlota*, meaning "a mistress."  The evolution of the word shows a shift in meaning from simply a mistress to a woman engaged in prostitution, with a corresponding increase in negative connotation over time.
