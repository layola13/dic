词源:
The word "rave" ultimately derives from Old Norse *hræfa, meaning "to scold, rebuke," or "to rave, be delirious." This suggests an earlier meaning connected to uncontrolled or excited speech. Over time, its meaning shifted, retaining the element of energetic and uncontrolled expression, but emphasizing the positive aspects, like enthusiasm and praise.
