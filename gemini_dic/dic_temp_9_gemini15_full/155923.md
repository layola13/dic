photodegradation: /ˌfoʊtoʊdeɡrəˈdeɪʃən/ | n. | 光降解；光致降解 | The deterioration of a material caused by exposure to light.  This process often involves chemical changes within the material, leading to a loss of its original properties.  | Example:  The photodegradation of plastics in sunlight is a significant environmental concern.  光降解塑料在阳光下的现象是重要的环境问题。  The rapid photodegradation of the dye reduced its effectiveness. 染料的光降解迅速降低了它的效力。|近义词：light degradation, photodecomposition | 反义词：photostabilization


USAGE->
