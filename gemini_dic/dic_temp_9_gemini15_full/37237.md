词源:  From Middle English *comfortere, from Old French *comforteur, from *comforter,  ultimately from Latin *comfortare "to strengthen," from *com- "together" + *fortis "strong." The sense evolved from "strengthener" to "one who strengthens the spirit" to "one who comforts." The meaning of "bedding" developed later.
