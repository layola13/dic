The word "monchy" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling? Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a slang term or regional dialect word:**  If it's slang, its meaning would be highly context-dependent and likely not found in standard dictionaries.  More information about where you encountered the word would be helpful.
* **It's a newly coined word:**  New words are constantly entering the language, but without more context, it's impossible to determine the meaning.

Please provide more information so I can assist you better.
