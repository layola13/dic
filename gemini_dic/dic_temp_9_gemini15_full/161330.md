postpositive:/ˌpəʊstˈpɒzɪtɪv/| adj.|后置的，后缀的|Placed after the word it modifies.  A postpositive adjective follows the noun it describes, rather than preceding it as most adjectives do. This is less common in English than in some other languages.|例句：The heir apparent, though a young man, was already burdened by responsibilities. (Here, "apparent" is a postpositive adjective.)  这个继承人虽然年轻，却已承担了沉重的责任。(这里，“apparent”是一个后置形容词。)  例句：The children, happy and excited, ran home. (Here, "happy" and "excited" are postpositive adjectives.) 孩子们又高兴又兴奋地跑回家。(这里，“happy”和“excited”是后置形容词。)|近义词：suffixal (when referring to word formation)|反义词：prepositive|形容词
