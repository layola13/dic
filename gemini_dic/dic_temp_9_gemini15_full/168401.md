proalien:/proˈeɪliən/| adj.| 亲外星人(的)；支持外星人(的)|  Pro-alien describes someone who supports or advocates for aliens, often in the context of extraterrestrial life or the potential for contact with alien civilizations. It's a relatively new term, combining the prefix "pro-" (meaning "in favor of") with "alien." The word doesn't have a long history or established usage like some other words, and its meaning is highly dependent on context.  | Example:  The pro-alien group organized a conference to discuss the possibility of life beyond Earth. 亲外星人团体组织了一次会议来讨论地球以外生命存在的可能性。|近义词: pro-extraterrestrial, alien-friendly|反义词: anti-alien, xenophobic|形容词
