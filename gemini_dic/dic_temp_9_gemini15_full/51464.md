词源:
The word "detonator" comes from the verb "detonate," which itself is derived from the French word "détoner," meaning "to thunder" or "to make a loud noise."  The suffix "-ator" indicates an agent or instrument that performs the action. Therefore, a detonator is an instrument that causes a loud noise (explosion).
