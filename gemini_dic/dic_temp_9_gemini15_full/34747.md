The word "clienter" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a particular field or jargon.

If you intended a different word, please provide the correct spelling.  If "clienter" is indeed a newly coined word, please provide context so I can attempt to understand its intended meaning and offer a possible analysis based on that context.
