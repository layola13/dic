fissionability:/ˌfɪʃənˈæbɪləti/| n. |裂变性，可裂变性|The ability of a nucleus to undergo fission.  This property is crucial in nuclear reactions, particularly in the context of nuclear power generation and weaponry.  The fissionability of a nucleus depends on several factors, including its size and the stability of its configuration.|例句：The high fissionability of uranium-235 makes it suitable for use in nuclear reactors.  铀-235的高裂变性使其适合用于核反应堆。

The fissionability of plutonium is even higher than that of uranium. 钚的裂变性甚至高于铀。|近义词：fissile, fissibility|反义词：infissionability (This is not a commonly used word, and "non-fissionable" is preferred.)
