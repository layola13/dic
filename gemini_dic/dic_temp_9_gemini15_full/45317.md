Etymology:

From Middle English *cumbrous, from Anglo-French *cumbrous, from Old North French *combroius, from Old French combre "obstacle, hindrance," of uncertain origin, possibly related to Old High German *chumbro "barrier, obstacle."  The evolution of meaning reflects the shift from a physical obstruction to something difficult to manage due to its size or complexity.
