词源:

The word "miter" ultimately derives from the Old French word *mitre*, meaning "mitre" (the bishop's headdress).  This in turn comes from the Latin word *mitra*, of Greek origin, referring to a head covering.  The application to woodworking likely arose from the similarity in shape between the angled joint and the pointed shape of the mitre.
