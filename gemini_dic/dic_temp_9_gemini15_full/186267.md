rhizoid:/ˈraɪzɔɪd/| n. |假根，根状体| A rhizoid is a root-like structure in some plants, especially in lower plants such as mosses and liverworts, that anchors the plant to a substrate and absorbs water and nutrients.  Unlike true roots, rhizoids lack vascular tissue. |Example: The moss plant anchored itself to the rock surface using its rhizoids.  苔藓植物利用它的假根固定在岩石表面。|近义词：rootlet (in some contexts), filament |反义词：root (true root)
