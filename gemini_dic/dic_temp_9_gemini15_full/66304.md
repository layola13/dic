词源:

The word "excrementitious" is derived from the Latin word "excrementum," meaning "excrement" or "waste matter."  The suffix "-itious" is added to create an adjectival form, indicating a quality or characteristic of something.  Therefore, the word literally means "having the nature of excrement."
