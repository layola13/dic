The word "cantred" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* **It's a dialect word:** It might be a regional or archaic term not widely known.  If you encountered it in a specific context (book, conversation, etc.), providing that context would be helpful.
* **It's a neologism:** It could be a newly coined word not yet established in common usage.


To get the information you need, please provide more context or clarify the spelling.
