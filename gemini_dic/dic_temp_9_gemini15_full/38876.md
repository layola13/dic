词源:
The word "conferenced" derives from the verb "confer," meaning to discuss something with someone.  "Confer" ultimately comes from the Latin word "conferre," meaning "to bring together,"  formed from the prefix "con-" (together) and "ferre" (to carry, bear).  The "-ed" suffix indicates the past participle form, used here adjectivally.
