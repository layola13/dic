proostracum:/ˌproʊˈstrɑːkəm/| n. |原肠胚|The proostracum is a term used in developmental biology to refer to the earliest stage of gastrulation in some animals, specifically those undergoing invagination. It represents the initial inward folding of the blastula, forming a primitive gut or archenteron.  This structure is crucial for the formation of the germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) and the establishment of body axes.  The term is less common than "gastrula," which refers to a later stage of development. |例句：The formation of the proostracum marks the beginning of gastrulation in this species. = 该物种原肠胚的形成标志着原肠胚形成的开始。|近义词：gastrula (later stage)|反义词：blastula (earlier stage)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The proostracum forms during early development. = 原肠胚在早期发育过程中形成。

疑问句:
What is the role of the proostracum in development? = 原肠胚在发育中的作用是什么？
How does the proostracum form? = 原肠胚是如何形成的？


否定句:
The proostracum is not visible at this stage of development. = 在这个发育阶段，原肠胚是不可见的。
We did not observe any abnormalities in the proostracum. = 我们没有观察到原肠胚有任何异常。
