词源:  The word is a combination of "pre-" (meaning before) and "tabulation" (the act of arranging data in a table).  "Tabulation" originates from the Latin word "tabula," meaning "board" or "tablet," referring to the surface upon which data was written or inscribed.  The suffix "-ation" indicates the process or result of an action.
