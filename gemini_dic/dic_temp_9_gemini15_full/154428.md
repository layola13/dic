词源:
The word "permitted" comes from the verb "permit," which originates from the Old French word "permettre," meaning "to allow" or "to grant permission."  The Old French word ultimately derives from the Latin prefix "per-" (through, thoroughly) and the verb "mittere" (to send, to let go).  Therefore, the root meaning points to the idea of "letting something through" or "allowing something to pass."
