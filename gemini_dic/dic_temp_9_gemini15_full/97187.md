infixion:/ɪnˈfɪkʃən/| n.| 词缀；嵌入式；嵌入 | An infixion is a morpheme inserted into the middle of a word.  It's a type of affix that doesn't occur at the beginning (prefix) or end (suffix) of a word.  Infixion is relatively rare in English but more common in other languages. | Example:  While not common in English, some might argue that "-bloody-" in "abso-bloody-lutely" acts as an infix. (Note: This is a debated point and not a universally accepted example of infixion in English). |近义词：interfix (less common)|反义词：prefix, suffix|名词
