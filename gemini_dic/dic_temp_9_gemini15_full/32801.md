词源:
The word "choirest" derives from the Old English word "cēorl," meaning a freeman or peasant.  Over time, it evolved to mean "choir," a group of singers.  The superlative suffix "-est" was then added to create "choirest," signifying "of the highest quality"  ,  likely referencing the superior skill and selection within a choir.  While the direct etymological link to "choir" isn't fully established, the semantic shift highlights the association of "choirest" with excellence and selection, reminiscent of the careful selection of voices in a choir.
