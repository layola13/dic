The word "sapia" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  It might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer suggestions.

2. **A neologism or a word from another language:** It might be a newly coined word, a technical term, or a word from another language that hasn't been adopted into English.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **A proper noun:** It could be a name (person, place, or thing).

Without more information, I cannot provide the requested details (pronunciation, word class, meaning, etc.). Please provide context or clarify the spelling.
