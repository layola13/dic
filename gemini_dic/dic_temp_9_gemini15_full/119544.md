microservices:/ˈmaɪkroʊˌsɜːrvɪsɪz/ | n. |微服务 |Microservices are a software development technique where complex applications are built as a suite of small, independent services. Each service focuses on a specific business function and communicates with other services through lightweight mechanisms like APIs.  This approach contrasts with monolithic architectures where all functionalities are tightly coupled within a single application. | Example:  Our company adopted a microservices architecture to improve scalability and maintainability of our platform.  我们的公司采用了微服务架构来提高平台的可扩展性和可维护性。 |近义词：distributed services, modular services |反义词：monolithic architecture
