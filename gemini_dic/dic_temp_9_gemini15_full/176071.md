近义词：ecstatically, delightedly, enthusiastically, fervently (for the positive sense); violently, brutally (for the negative sense - use cautiously)


反义词：indifferently, apathetically, unenthusiastically, coldly (for the positive sense); gently, respectfully (for the negative sense - use cautiously)


词源：源自动词 "ravish," which originally meant "to seize and carry away," often in a violent or forceful manner.  Over time, it developed a second meaning, "to overwhelm with delight or pleasure."  The adverb "ravishedly" reflects both meanings, though the positive one is more common in modern usage.  The negative sense should be used with extreme caution, as it can be deeply offensive.
