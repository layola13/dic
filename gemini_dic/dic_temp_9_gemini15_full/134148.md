/ˌnɒnɪmprɛʃənəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. |非印象力，不可感知性 |  The word "nonimpressionabilities" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, formed by combining "non-" (not), "impression" (the act of making an impression or impact), and "-abilities" (the state or quality of being able). It suggests a lack of ability to make an impression or be perceived.  There are no standard dictionaries or corpora that list this word.  Therefore, providing usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical tenses is impossible.  The word needs to be understood within the context where it was used to ascertain its intended meaning.  |  No example sentence can be provided as this is not a recognised word. | No synonyms or antonyms can be provided. |n.
