schottky:/ˈʃɒtki/|/ˈʃɑːtki/| n.|肖特基|A Schottky diode is a semiconductor diode that uses a metal-semiconductor junction instead of a p-n junction.  This results in a lower forward voltage drop and a faster switching speed compared to conventional p-n junction diodes.|例句：The circuit uses a Schottky diode to improve efficiency.  这个电路使用肖特基二极管来提高效率。|近义词：metal-semiconductor diode|反义词：p-n junction diode
