pyrophorus:/paɪˈrɒfərəs/| n. |萤火虫属的一种甲虫；发光甲虫| A genus of click beetles (family Elateridae) known for their bioluminescence.  They are often called fireflies, but are distinct from the true fireflies in the family Lampyridae.  The light produced is used for attracting mates and possibly for defense. | Example:  The *Pyrophorus* genus exhibits a remarkable ability to produce light. = *Pyrophorus*属表现出非凡的发光能力。|近义词：firefly (in some contexts), click beetle |反义词：N/A


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The *Pyrophorus* beetle produces light. = 萤火虫属的甲虫发光。
These insects attract mates using bioluminescence. = 这些昆虫利用生物发光吸引配偶。


一般过去时:
Scientists studied the *Pyrophorus* beetle's light. = 科学家研究了萤火虫属甲虫的光。
The light attracted predators last night. = 昨夜，灯光吸引了捕食者。


现在完成时:
Researchers have discovered new species of *Pyrophorus*. = 研究人员已经发现了新的萤火虫属物种。
The beetle has already used its light to attract a mate. = 甲虫已经用它的光吸引了配偶。


过去完成时:
Before the experiment, the scientists had observed the beetle's behavior. = 在实验之前，科学家们已经观察了甲虫的行为。
They had already documented several light patterns. = 他们已经记录了几种发光模式。


将来时:
Scientists will study the chemical reactions involved in bioluminescence. = 科学家们将研究生物发光中涉及的化学反应。
We will observe the beetle's light display tonight. = 我们今晚将观察甲虫的发光展示。


虚拟语气:
If the beetle didn't produce light, it wouldn't attract mates. = 如果甲虫不发光，它就不会吸引配偶。
I wish I could witness the *Pyrophorus* beetle's light show. = 我希望我能目睹萤火虫属甲虫的光亮表演。


被动语态:

否定句:
The *Pyrophorus* beetle does not belong to the Lampyridae family. = 萤火虫属的甲虫不属于萤火虫科。
This species did not exhibit the typical bioluminescent patterns. = 这个物种没有表现出典型的生物发光模式。


PHRASE->
