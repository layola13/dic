词源:
The word "flounder" comes from the Middle English word "floundren," meaning "to struggle in mud or water."  This is likely connected to the Old English word "flōndrian," suggesting a connection to the action of a fish floundering, which is also the origin of the name of the flatfish.  The meaning then broadened to include struggling generally.
