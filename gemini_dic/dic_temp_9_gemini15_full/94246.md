反义词：mortality, transience, ephemerality, perishability, decay


词源:

* **im-:**  prefix meaning "not" or "without"
* **perish:** verb meaning "to die" or "to decay"
* **-able:** suffix forming adjectives meaning "capable of" or "worthy of"
* **-ity:** suffix forming nouns meaning "state or quality of"

Therefore, "imperishability" literally means "the state of not being able to perish" or "the state of not decaying".  It evolved from the root word "perish" through the addition of negative and nominalizing suffixes.
