nonsynchronous:/ˌnɒnˈsɪŋkrənəs/| adj. |不同步的，异步的|Not occurring at the same time; not synchronized.|The two processes were nonsynchronous, leading to data inconsistencies. 这两个进程不同步，导致数据不一致。|synchronous, simultaneous|asynchronous, simultaneous|形容词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The system is nonsynchronous. = 系统不同步。
These events are nonsynchronous. = 这些事件不同步。


一般过去时:
The clocks were nonsynchronous. = 钟表不同步。
The signals were nonsynchronous. = 信号不同步。


现在完成时:
The processes have been nonsynchronous. = 这些进程一直不同步。
The data streams have run nonsynchronously. = 数据流一直异步运行。


过去完成时:
The computers had been nonsynchronous before the upgrade. = 升级之前，电脑一直不同步。
The network had operated nonsynchronously for several hours. = 网络异步运行了几个小时。


将来时:
The operations will be nonsynchronous. = 操作将不同步。
The software will run nonsynchronously. = 软件将异步运行。


虚拟语气:
If the systems were nonsynchronous, we would have problems. = 如果系统不同步，我们将会有问题。
I wish the timing were not nonsynchronous. = 我希望时间不是不同步的。


被动语态:
The data was processed nonsynchronously. = 数据被异步处理。
The tasks were performed nonsynchronously. = 任务被异步执行。


疑问句:
Are the two systems nonsynchronous? = 这两个系统不同步吗？
Is the operation nonsynchronous? = 操作不同步吗？


否定句:
The tasks are not nonsynchronous; they are synchronized. = 任务不是不同步的；它们是同步的。
The processes are not nonsynchronous; they are working together. = 进程不是不同步的；它们一起工作。


PHRASE->
nonsynchronous communication = 异步通信
nonsynchronous data processing = 异步数据处理
nonsynchronous operation = 异步操作
nonsynchronous transfer = 异步传输
nonsynchronous parallel processing = 非同步并行处理
