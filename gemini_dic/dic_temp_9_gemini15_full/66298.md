词源:

The word "excreable" is derived from the Latin word "excreare," meaning "to separate," "to reject," or "to excrete."  Over time, the meaning shifted to denote something that is rejected as unpleasant or loathsome.  The suffix "-able" transforms the verb into an adjective, signifying something capable of being or worthy of being described as such.


用法说明:

Excreable is a strong adjective used to describe something that is intensely unpleasant or repulsive, often evoking disgust or strong disapproval. It's typically used to describe things like smells, tastes, actions, or situations, rather than abstract concepts. It is less common than its synonyms but carries a stronger sense of revulsion.
