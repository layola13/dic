词源:  The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to an extreme degree) and "feminize" (to make or become feminine). "Feminize" itself comes from "feminine" + "-ize" (a suffix forming verbs indicating to make or become something).  Ultimately, "feminine" traces back to Latin "femina" (woman).
