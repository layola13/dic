词源:
The word "definitely" comes from the Old French word "definitivement," which itself is derived from the Latin word "definitivus."  "Definitivus" is formed from "definire," meaning "to define,"  and the suffix "-tivus," indicating a quality or characteristic.  Therefore, the root meaning relates to something being clearly defined or established.


用法说明:
"Definitely" is an adverb used to emphasize that something is true or certain. It strengthens the assertion it modifies. It is generally considered a fairly formal adverb, but it's commonly used in everyday conversation.
