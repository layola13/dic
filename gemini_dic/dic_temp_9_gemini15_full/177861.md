receptors:/rɪˈsɛptərz/| n.|受体，感受器|A receptor is a protein or a group of proteins that receives chemical signals from outside a cell or organism and initiates a response inside the cell or organism.  Receptors are crucial for cell communication and various physiological processes.|例句：Nerve cells have receptors that detect changes in pressure. 神经细胞具有检测压力变化的受体。|例句：The drug binds to specific receptors in the brain.  这种药物与大脑中的特定受体结合。|近义词：sensor, detector|反义词:transmitter, effector|名词


USAGE->
