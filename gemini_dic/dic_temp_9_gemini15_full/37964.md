词源：
The word "complexity" comes from the Late Latin word "complexitas," which is a combination of "complexus" (meaning "entwined," "involved," or "woven together") and the suffix "-itas" (which forms nouns of quality or state).  Therefore, the word's roots suggest a state of being intricately interwoven or interconnected, leading to difficulty in understanding or managing.
