discriminant: /dɪˈskrɪmɪnənt/ | n. |判别式，判别物|The discriminant is a value calculated from the coefficients of a polynomial equation, used to determine the nature of its roots (solutions).  It helps to classify the types of solutions, whether they are real, complex, or repeated. For example, in a quadratic equation ax² + bx + c = 0, the discriminant is b² - 4ac. If the discriminant is positive, the equation has two distinct real roots; if it is zero, it has one repeated real root; and if it is negative, it has two complex conjugate roots.|The discriminant of the quadratic equation x² - 5x + 6 = 0 is 1, indicating two distinct real roots.|determinant,  indicator|nondiscriminatory|
