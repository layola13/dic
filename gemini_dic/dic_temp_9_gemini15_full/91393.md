hydrotrope:/ˈhaɪdrətroʊp/| n.|助溶剂|A hydrotrope is a substance that increases the solubility of one substance in another, typically increasing the solubility of a poorly soluble substance (hydrophobe) in water.  This happens without significantly altering the surface tension of the water. Hydrotropes work by interacting with both the solute and the solvent, forming micelles or other structures that help to disperse the solute more effectively. They are often used in cleaning products and other industrial applications to improve the solubility of surfactants and other ingredients.|例句：Sodium xylene sulfonate is a common hydrotrope used in detergents to increase the solubility of other components.  = 十二烷基苯磺酸钠是一种常用的助溶剂，用于洗涤剂中以增加其他成分的溶解度。
