The word "recrent" is not a word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  If you can provide the intended word or context, I can help you analyze it.
