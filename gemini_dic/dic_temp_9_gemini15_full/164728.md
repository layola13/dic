prefamiliarities:/ˌpriːfəˌmɪliˈærətiz/| n.| 预先熟悉；事先了解；初步了解 |  A state of being somewhat familiar with something or someone before a more thorough acquaintance.  This word is a relatively rare neologism, a blend of "pre-" (before) and "familiarities" (instances of familiarity).  It implies a superficial or initial understanding, not a deep or complete knowledge.  | 例句：His prefamiliarities with the subject matter allowed him to grasp the lecture's main points quickly.  = 他对主题的预先了解使他能很快抓住讲座的主要内容。
