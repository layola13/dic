This substance is easily nitrifiable. = 此物质易于硝化。


一般过去时:
The waste was nitrifiable. = 废物是可硝化的。
The water sample was determined to be nitrifiable. = 水样被确定为可硝化的。


现在完成时:
Scientists have found many nitrifiable compounds. = 科学家们已经发现了许多可硝化的化合物。
The researchers have shown that this material is nitrifiable. = 研究人员已经证明这种材料是可硝化的。


过去完成时:
The engineers had ensured the waste was nitrifiable before treatment. = 工程师们在处理前已确保废物可硝化。
It had been determined that the material was indeed nitrifiable. = 人们已经确定该物质确实是可硝化的。


将来时:
This process will make the waste nitrifiable. = 此过程将使废物可硝化。
The new technology will allow for more efficient nitrification of nitrifiable materials. = 新技术将允许更有效地硝化可硝化的物质。


虚拟语气:
If the material were nitrifiable, the process would be much simpler. = 如果该物质可硝化，则该过程将简单得多。
It is essential that the wastewater be nitrifiable before entering the treatment plant. = 废水进入处理厂前必须是可硝化的。


被动语态:
