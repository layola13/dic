oospore:/ˈoʊəspoʊr/| n. | 卵孢子 | A thick-walled resting spore formed by the fusion of two gametes in certain fungi, algae, and water molds.  It is a diploid cell, resistant to adverse conditions, and capable of germinating to produce a new organism. | Example: The oospore of Phytophthora infestans, the causal agent of late blight in potatoes, can survive in the soil for extended periods.  卵孢子疫霉（马铃薯晚疫病的病原体）的卵孢子可以在土壤中存活很长时间。 |近义词：zygospore (in some contexts)|反义词：gamete (as it's formed from the fusion of gametes)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The oospore survives harsh conditions. = 卵孢子能在恶劣的环境中存活。

Scientists observed the formation of the oospore. = 科学家观察了卵孢子的形成。


现在完成时:
The oospore has survived the winter. = 卵孢子已经度过了冬天。
Researchers have identified the oospore as a key stage in the life cycle. = 研究人员已经确定卵孢子是生命周期中的一个关键阶段。


过去完成时:
The oospore had already germinated before the analysis. = 在分析之前，卵孢子已经发芽了。
The plant had produced many oospores the previous season. = 植物在上一季已经产生了大量的卵孢子。


将来时:
The oospore will germinate in the spring. = 卵孢子将在春天发芽。
The experiment will show how the oospore develops. = 实验将展示卵孢子是如何发育的。


虚拟语气:
If the conditions were right, the oospore would germinate immediately. = 如果条件合适，卵孢子会立即发芽。
It is important that the oospore remains dormant until conditions are favorable. = 卵孢子在条件有利之前保持休眠状态很重要。


被动语态:

疑问句:
How long can the oospore survive? = 卵孢子能存活多久？
What triggers the germination of the oospore? = 什么会触发卵孢子的发芽？


否定句:
The oospore did not germinate in the dry soil. = 卵孢子在干燥的土壤中没有发芽。
The experiment did not show any evidence of oospore formation. = 实验没有显示任何卵孢子形成的证据。
