词源:
The term "first-footers" is a compound word combining "first" (meaning the first to do something) and "footers" (referring to those who visit).  It reflects the Scottish and other British Isles traditions around New Year's Day where the first person to enter a home after midnight on New Year's Eve is believed to bring either good luck or bad luck to the household for the coming year.  The practice and the term itself are relatively modern, arising from the popularization of the tradition. There isn't a direct etymological origin tracing back centuries.
