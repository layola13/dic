词源:
The word "projector" comes from the verb "project," meaning "to throw or cast forward."  The suffix "-or" indicates an agent or instrument.  The root of "project" comes from the Latin word "proicere," which is a combination of "pro" (forward) and "iacere" (to throw).  Therefore, a projector is literally a device that throws or casts an image forward.
