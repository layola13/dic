词源:

The word "limitedness's" derives from the adjective "limited" (meaning restricted or having boundaries), adding "-ness" to form the noun "limitedness" (meaning the state or quality of being limited), and finally adding the possessive apostrophe-s ("'s") to indicate possession or belonging.  The "-ness" suffix is a common way to create abstract nouns in English from adjectives.  The root is likely the verb "limit" deriving from Latin "limitare".
