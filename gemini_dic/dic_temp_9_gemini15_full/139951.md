odontogeny:/ˌɒdɒnˈtɒdʒəni/|/ˌoʊdɒnˈtɑːdʒəni/| n. |牙发生，牙齿发育|The process by which teeth are formed and develop.  It encompasses all stages from the initial formation of dental tissues to the eruption of fully formed teeth into the oral cavity.  This complex process involves various signaling pathways, gene expression, and cellular interactions.|The study of odontogeny helps us understand dental anomalies and develop treatments for various dental diseases. |近义词：tooth development, dentition development|反义词：无
