/ˌnɑːnˌnɑːmɪˈneɪʃənz/ | n. | 未提名；未被提名的人或事 | The nonnominations were as noteworthy as the nominations themselves.  未被提名的人或事和被提名的人或事一样引人注目。|近义词： omissions, oversights | 反义词： nominations


The word "nonnominations" is not a standard dictionary entry. It's a compound word formed from "non-" (meaning "not") and "nominations" (the act of nominating someone or something). Therefore, its meaning is derived directly from its constituent parts.  There is no specific etymology beyond the combination of the prefix "non" (from Latin, meaning "not") and "nominations" (from Latin "nominatio", a naming or appointing).

USAGE->
This word, being a noun, doesn't have verb conjugations like the example word "what".  It functions grammatically as a plural noun.


Example Sentences:


The number of nonnominations surprised everyone. = 未被提名的人数让每个人都感到惊讶。

The committee reviewed both the nominations and the nonnominations. = 委员会审查了提名和未提名的情况。


PHRASE->

There are no common phrases specifically using "nonnominations".  Phrases would need to be context-specific.  For example:


"A list of nonnominations" = 未提名名单
"Reasons for the nonnominations" = 未提名原因
"Analysis of the nonnominations" = 未提名分析
"The significance of the nonnominations" = 未提名事件的重要性
"Debate over the nonnominations" = 关于未提名事件的辩论
