词源:
The word "overpublicizing" is a combination of "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") and "publicizing" (the act of making something known to the public).  "Publicizing" itself comes from "public" (meaning "of or concerning the people") and "-ize" (a suffix forming verbs).  Therefore, the word's roots lie in the concept of making something excessively known to the public.
