词源:
The word "quirkinesses" is derived from the noun "quirk," meaning an oddity or peculiarity.  "Quirk" itself has uncertain origins, possibly related to Middle English words suggesting twisting or turning.  The suffix "-ness" indicates a state or quality, and the further suffix "-es" denotes the plural form.
