词源:
The word "macroeconomic" is a compound word formed from "macro-" and "economic".  "Macro-" is derived from the Greek word "μακρός" (makrós), meaning "large" or "long". "Economic" comes from the Greek word "οἰκονομία" (oikonomia), meaning "management of a household" or "administration".  Therefore, "macroeconomic" literally refers to the study of the economy on a large scale, as opposed to microeconomics which focuses on individual economic agents.
