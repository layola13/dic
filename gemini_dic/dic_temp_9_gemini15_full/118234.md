The word "merce" does not exist as a standalone word in standard English.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  The word might be a misspelling, a very rare archaic word, or a word from another language.  If you can provide more context (like a sentence where you encountered it), I can offer a more informed response.
