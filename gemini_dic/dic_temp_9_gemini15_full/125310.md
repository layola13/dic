multigrid:/ˈmʌltiɡrɪd/ | n. |多重网格法，多网格法 | A numerical technique for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), especially elliptic PDEs. It uses a hierarchy of grids of different resolutions to accelerate the convergence of iterative methods.  The coarser grids provide a global overview of the solution, while the finer grids capture local details. | Example: Multigrid methods are highly effective for solving large-scale systems of linear equations arising from the discretization of PDEs. 多重网格法非常有效地解决了由偏微分方程离散化产生的庞大线性方程组。 | 近义词：hierarchical grid methods, multilevel methods | 反义词：single-grid method


USAGE->
This word is primarily a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "hello".  Therefore, verb tenses (present, past, future, etc.) are not applicable.  The usage focuses on how "multigrid" is used in sentences within the context of numerical methods and scientific computing.


Example sentences demonstrating usage:

1. The performance of the multigrid solver was significantly better than the single-grid approach. 多重网格求解器的性能明显优于单网格方法。

2.  Researchers are exploring new algorithms to improve the efficiency of multigrid methods for fluid dynamics simulations. 研究人员正在探索新的算法，以提高流体动力学模拟中多重网格方法的效率。

3.  The accuracy of the solution depends on the choice of the multigrid parameters, such as the number of levels and smoothing iterations. 解的精度取决于多重网格参数的选择，例如层数和平滑迭代次数。

4.  Implementing a multigrid method requires careful consideration of the grid hierarchy and transfer operators.  实现多重网格方法需要仔细考虑网格层次结构和传递算子。
