pretemperate: /ˌpriːˈtɛmpəreɪt/ | adj. | 预先调和的；预先缓和的 |  Not found in standard dictionaries. It seems to be a less common or possibly a newly coined word formed by combining "pre-" (before) and "temperate" (moderate, mild).  Therefore, a precise definition and usage examples require more context.  A likely meaning would be something that is made moderate or mild beforehand. | Example: The pretemperate response prevented further escalation. (This is a hypothetical example based on the likely meaning.) |  Near Synonyms (depending on context): pre-mediated, pre-arranged,  moderated, mitigated | Antonyms (depending on context):  unmitigated, extreme, immoderate | adj.
