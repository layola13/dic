词源:
The word "morals" comes from the Old French word "morals," which in turn derives from the Latin word "mores," meaning "customs," "manners," or "character."  The Latin word is related to the Greek word "mos," meaning "custom."  The evolution from custom to moral principles reflects the gradual development of ethical frameworks within societies.
