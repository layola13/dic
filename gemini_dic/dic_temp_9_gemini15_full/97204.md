词源:
From "inflammable," combining the prefix "in-" (meaning "in" or "on") with "flammable," derived from the Latin "flamma" (flame).  The word "inflammable" originally meant "capable of being set on fire," but due to confusion with the prefix "in-" sometimes meaning "not," the term "flammable" is now preferred in many contexts to avoid ambiguity.
