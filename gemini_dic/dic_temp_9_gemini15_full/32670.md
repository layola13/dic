词源：The word "chivalrous" comes from the Old French word "chevalerie," meaning "knighthood" or "horsemanship."  The concept of chivalry evolved from the medieval knightly code, emphasizing honor, courage, courtesy, and loyalty.  "Chevalerie" itself is derived from "cheval," meaning "horse," reflecting the central role of horses in medieval warfare and knightly life.
