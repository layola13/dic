词源:

The word "disciplining" comes from the word "discipline," which originates from the Old French word "discipline,"  itself derived from the Latin word "disciplina," meaning "instruction, teaching, learning."  The Latin word further derives from "discipulus," meaning "pupil, learner, disciple."  The evolution reflects the shift in meaning from pure instruction to the broader concept of training and control, including punitive measures when necessary.
