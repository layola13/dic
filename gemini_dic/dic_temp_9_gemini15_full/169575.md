词源:  Comes from the noun "prophet" + the suffix "-like," indicating resemblance. "Prophet" itself originates from the Old French "profete" and ultimately from the Late Latin "propheta," derived from the Greek "προφήτης" (prophētēs), meaning "one who speaks for another," "interpreter," or "speaker."  The "-like" suffix is a common English derivational suffix indicating similarity or resemblance.
