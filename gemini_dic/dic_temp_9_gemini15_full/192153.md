词源:
The word "scramble" ultimately derives from the Old Norse word "skramla," meaning "to climb," "to clamber," or "to scrape."  This reflects the action of climbing or moving quickly and awkwardly, which is still a core meaning of the word.  Over time, the meaning expanded to include the act of mixing things together in a haphazard way, particularly in the context of cooking eggs.
