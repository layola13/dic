cystolith:/ˈsɪstoʊlɪθ/| n. |膀胱结石；细胞结晶体|A cystolith is a concretion of calcium salts, typically calcium oxalate, that forms within a plant cell, usually in the leaf epidermis. They are often visible as small, shiny crystals.  |Example:  Microscopic examination revealed numerous cystoliths within the leaf tissue. 显微镜检查显示叶组织内有许多膀胱结石。|近义词：calcium oxalate crystal (in this context)|反义词：无|名词
