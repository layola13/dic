词源：

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi* meaning "as if," "as it were," "almost," or "seemingly."

* **submissively**: From "submissive," derived from the Latin *submittere*, meaning "to submit," composed of *sub-* (under) and *mittere* (to send, let go).  The "-ly" suffix indicates an adverbial form.


用法说明：

The adverb "quasi-submissively" describes an action or behavior that exhibits some characteristics of submissiveness but lacks the full extent or conviction of true submission. It suggests a reluctance or a degree of internal resistance alongside the outward display of compliance.  The "quasi-" prefix softens the meaning of "submissively," adding a nuance of uncertainty, hesitation, or incompleteness to the submission.
