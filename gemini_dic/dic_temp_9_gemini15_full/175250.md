词源:
The word "railway" comes from the combination of "rail" and "way."  "Rail" ultimately derives from Old French "raille," meaning "a bar," or "a rod," while "way" is a very old word of Germanic origin related to the concept of a path or road.  The combination thus literally means a "way of rails."
