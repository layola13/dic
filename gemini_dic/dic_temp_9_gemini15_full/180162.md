The word "reformade" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or archaic vocabulary.  To provide an analysis, further context (e.g., the source where you encountered the word) is needed.
