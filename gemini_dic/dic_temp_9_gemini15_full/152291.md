词源:  The word derives from "patter," which originally meant rapid, light, or indistinct speech.  This word, in turn, likely comes from an imitative origin, reflecting the sound of quick, repetitive speech.  The "-er's" suffix indicates possession or relationship, thus "patterer's" signifies something belonging to or characteristic of a patterer.
