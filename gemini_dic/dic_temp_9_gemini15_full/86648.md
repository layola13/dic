The word "helle" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant "hello," "hell," or another word entirely.
2. **A proper noun:** A place name, person's name, or brand name.
3. **A word from another language:**  It might be a word from a different language that has been incorrectly transcribed or is not widely known.

If you could provide more context, I can try to help you figure out what word you intended.  For example, where did you encounter this word? What was the surrounding text or conversation?
