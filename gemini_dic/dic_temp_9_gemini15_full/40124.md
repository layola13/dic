词源:
The word "contemplating" comes from the Latin word "contemplari," which means "to consider," "to observe," or "to survey."  The prefix "con-" means "together" or "with," and the root "-templari" is related to the word "temple," suggesting a place of reflection and worship.  Thus, the original sense implied a focused and often reverent observation.
