The word "moellon" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?

2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name, place, or brand name.  More context is needed.

3. **It's a word from another language:**  It might be a word from a different language, possibly with a similar-sounding word in English.  If you can provide the language of origin, I might be able to help.

4. **It's a neologism or highly specialized term:** It could be a newly coined word or a term used in a very specific field (e.g., technical, scientific).  Providing the context where you encountered this word would be helpful.
