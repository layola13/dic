词源:
The word "mercifulness" derives from the adjective "merciful," which in turn comes from the Old French word "merceable" and ultimately from the Latin word "misericordia," meaning "mercy."  The suffix "-ness" is a common English suffix that turns adjectives into nouns, indicating a quality or state.
