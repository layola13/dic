词源:  The word "illogically" is derived from the word "logical," which comes from the late Middle English word "logical," itself ultimately from Late Latin *logicālis, from Latin logica ("logic"), from Greek λογική (logikḗ, "possessed of reason, intellectual, dialectical"), from λόγος (lógos, "word, speech, reason"). The prefix "il-" is a negative prefix meaning "not."  Therefore, "illogically" means "not logically."
