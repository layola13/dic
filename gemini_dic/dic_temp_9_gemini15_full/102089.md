isopycnic:/ˌaɪsoʊˈpɪknɪk/| adj.|等密度的；等比重的|Of or relating to equal density.  Isopycnic refers to a condition of equal density, often used in the context of density gradient centrifugation, where particles separate based on their density relative to the surrounding medium.|例句：Isopycnic centrifugation is a powerful technique for separating macromolecules based on their buoyant density. 等密度离心是根据大分子物质的浮力密度分离它们的一种强大的技术。|近义词：isodense|反义词：anisopycnic
