cyclone-separators:/ˈsaɪkləʊnˌsepəreɪtərz/| n. |旋风分离器|A cyclone separator is a piece of equipment that uses centrifugal force to separate solids from a gas stream or liquids from a liquid stream.  It works by spinning the mixture rapidly, causing the heavier particles to be thrown outwards to the walls of the separator, where they are collected. The lighter phase (gas or liquid) then flows out of the center.|The factory uses cyclone separators to remove dust from the exhaust air.|近义词：dust collector, centrifugal separator|反义词：None specifically, but devices that don't separate by centrifugal force could be considered opposites, such as filters based on other principles.


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Cyclone separators remove particulate matter from gas streams. = 旋风分离器去除气流中的颗粒物。
These cyclone separators operate continuously. = 这些旋风分离器连续运行。


一般过去时:
The cyclone separator separated the sand from the air. = 旋风分离器将沙子与空气分离。
Engineers installed new cyclone separators last week. = 工程师们上周安装了新的旋风分离器。


现在完成时:
The plant has used cyclone separators for years. = 该工厂多年来一直使用旋风分离器。
They have improved the efficiency of the cyclone separators. = 他们提高了旋风分离器的效率。


过去完成时:
The dust collector had malfunctioned before the cyclone separator was implemented. = 在安装旋风分离器之前，集尘器就已经发生故障了。
The engineers had already designed the cyclone separators before the project started. = 工程师们在项目开始之前就已经设计好了旋风分离器。


将来时:
We will install new cyclone separators next month. = 我们下个月将安装新的旋风分离器。
The company will be using larger cyclone separators in the future. = 公司将来会使用更大的旋风分离器。


虚拟语气:
If we had used better cyclone separators, the air would be cleaner. = 如果我们使用了更好的旋风分离器，空气会更干净。
It is important that the cyclone separators are regularly maintained. = 定期维护旋风分离器非常重要。


被动语态:
The dust is removed by cyclone separators. = 灰尘由旋风分离器去除。
The cyclone separators are regularly inspected for wear and tear. = 旋风分离器定期检查磨损情况。


疑问句:
What type of cyclone separators do you use? = 你使用哪种类型的旋风分离器？
How efficient are these cyclone separators? = 这些旋风分离器效率如何？


否定句:
The cyclone separator did not remove all the particles. = 旋风分离器并没有去除所有颗粒。
We don't need to replace the cyclone separators yet. = 我们现在还不需要更换旋风分离器。


PHRASE->
cyclone separator design = 旋风分离器设计
cyclone separator efficiency = 旋风分离器效率
high-efficiency cyclone separator = 高效旋风分离器
cyclone separator selection = 旋风分离器选择
cyclone separator application = 旋风分离器应用
