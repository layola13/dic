/ˈpɪtɔɪd/ | adj. | 可怜的，悲惨的 | pitiable; deserving or causing pity.  The pitiroid child was abandoned on the street.  | 近义词：pathetic, lamentable, miserable | 反义词：fortunate, lucky, blessed |  adj.


The word "pityroid" is not a standard English word.  There's no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  If it was intended to be a word, it might be an attempt to create a word related to "pity," possibly meaning something that evokes or resembles pity.  However, without further context or a definition from the source where it appeared, a proper analysis, including usage examples, is impossible.
