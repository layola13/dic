This word is extremely rare and is essentially the plural of "quantitativeness," which itself is not frequently used.  It refers to multiple instances or aspects of something being measurable or expressed numerically.  There's no established single best translation, as the most appropriate word depends on the context.  The word is formed by adding the plural suffix "-es" to the noun "quantitativeness."

The word is derived from "quantitative," which comes from the Latin word "quantitas," meaning "quantity." The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "quantitative" into a noun, indicating the state or quality of being quantitative.  The final "-es" adds the plural form.


Because of its rarity, providing example sentences using various tenses or grammatical structures is impractical.  The word is essentially only applicable in highly specialized contexts, mostly within academic or scientific writing where precise measurement is crucial.  Standard English would generally prefer alternative phrasing to avoid the word altogether.  For example, instead of "The study examined the quantitativenesses of the results," one might write "The study examined the quantitative aspects of the results" or "The study examined the various quantitative measures obtained."
