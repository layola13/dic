词源:
The word "marginalization" is derived from the adjective "marginal," meaning "situated on the edge or border."  "Marginal" itself comes from the Old French word "marginal," ultimately from the Latin word "marginalis," meaning "belonging to the margin" (from "margo," "margin").  The suffix "-ization" indicates the process of making something marginal or the state of being marginalized.
