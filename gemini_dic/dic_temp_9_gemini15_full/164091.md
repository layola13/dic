词源:

The word "predisgrace" is a relatively modern coinage. It combines the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "prior to") with the noun "disgrace." The word's formation reflects a desire to express the idea of disgrace that precedes a more significant event.  There is no classical or historical root beyond the combination of these two existing elements.
