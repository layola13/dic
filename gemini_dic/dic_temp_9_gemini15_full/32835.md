The word "cholate" is not a valid English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It may be a misspelling or a word from a specialized field not widely known.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis as requested.  If you could provide the correct spelling or more context, I would be happy to help.
