词源:
The word "reforming" comes from the verb "reform," which is derived from the Old French "reformer" and ultimately from the Latin "reformare."  "Re-" is a prefix meaning "again" or "anew," and "formare" means "to form" or "to shape."  Thus, "reforming" literally means "to form again" or "to reshape."
