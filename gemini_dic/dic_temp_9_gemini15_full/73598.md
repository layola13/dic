词源:

The word "forethought" is a compound word formed from "fore-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and "thought" (referring to the act of thinking or considering).  Its origins trace back to Old English "forþþanc," combining "forþ" (forth, forward) and "þanc" (thought).  The meaning has remained consistent over time, emphasizing the element of prior consideration.
