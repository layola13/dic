saccholactate:/ˌsækəˈlækteɪt/ | n. | 蔗糖乳酸盐 | Saccharolactate is a salt formed from the reaction of saccharic acid and a lactate.  It's a relatively uncommon term and specific information requires context, such as the specific lactate involved.  It's likely encountered in specialized fields like food science or biochemistry. |  The specific properties and uses of saccholactates would depend on the exact chemical composition.  Further information is needed for a more precise definition and application. | 近义词: (Requires context for appropriate synonyms) | 反义词: (Requires context for appropriate antonyms)

This word is not common enough for typical grammatical examples.  It's usage is highly specialized and context-dependent.  Grammatical structures would be typical for a noun.  For instance:


一般现在时:
The researcher studies the properties of the saccholactate. = 研究人员正在研究蔗糖乳酸盐的特性。
This product contains a specific type of saccholactate. = 此产品含有特定类型的蔗糖乳酸盐。


一般过去时:
They analyzed the saccholactate sample yesterday. = 他们昨天分析了蔗糖乳酸盐样品。
The experiment used a modified form of saccholactate. = 该实验使用了改良形式的蔗糖乳酸盐。


现在完成时:
Scientists have identified several types of saccholactates. = 科学家已经鉴定出几种类型的蔗糖乳酸盐。
We have investigated the effects of the saccholactate on the reaction. = 我们已经研究了蔗糖乳酸盐对反应的影响。


过去完成时:
The team had already prepared the saccholactate solution before the experiment. = 在实验之前，团队已经准备好蔗糖乳酸盐溶液。
