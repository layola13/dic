pressurage:/ˈprɛʃərɪdʒ/ | n. |加压；压力处理 | The process of applying pressure, typically to a fluid or gas, for a specific purpose.  This often involves increasing the pressure to improve performance or achieve a desired outcome.  It's a less common word, often found in specialized contexts. | Example: The pipeline requires regular pressurage to maintain efficient flow.  管道需要定期加压以保持高效的流量。 The pressurage of the hydraulic system is critical for its operation. 液压系统的加压对其操作至关重要。| 近义词：pressurization, pressurizing | 反义词：depressurization, depressurizing | 名词
