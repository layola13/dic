词源:

* **non-:**  A prefix meaning "not."
* **manner-:** From Old French *maniere*, ultimately from Latin *manus* ("hand").  Relates to the way something is done, a style or characteristic way of behaving or doing something.
* **-istic:** A suffix forming adjectives meaning "relating to," "characteristic of," or "of the nature of."


用法说明:

"Nonmanneristic" is primarily used to describe art, literature, or music that avoids exaggerated or overly distinctive stylistic features.  It suggests a natural, straightforward, and perhaps even understated approach, prioritizing content or meaning over showy technique.  It's the opposite of "mannered," which implies artificiality, affectation, or excessive adherence to a particular style.
