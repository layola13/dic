The word "dowset" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., following the requested format.  It may be:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or spelled word.  Could you double-check the spelling or provide more context where you encountered this word?
* **A neologism or slang:** A newly coined word or a word used within a specific community or context.  If this is the case, more information about its origin and usage is needed.
* **A proper noun:**  It might be a name, place, or brand, in which case a different approach would be required.

Please provide more information so I can assist you better.
