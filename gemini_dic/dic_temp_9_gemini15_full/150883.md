They have accounted for the paralactic effect in their analysis. = 他们在分析中考虑了视差效应。


过去完成时:
Before the correction, the paralactic effect was significant. = 校正之前，视差效应很大。
The scientists had already addressed the paralactic error in their earlier work. = 科学家们在其早期的工作中已经解决了视差误差。


将来时:
We will determine the paralactic angle using this new method. = 我们将使用这种新方法来确定视差角。
The results will show the influence of paralactic displacement. = 结果将显示视差位移的影响。


虚拟语气:
If the paralactic angle were known, we could calculate the distance. = 如果已知视差角，我们就可以计算距离。

疑问句:
What is the paralactic angle of this star? = 这颗星的视差角是多少？
Does paralactic error significantly affect the measurements? = 视差误差是否会显著影响测量结果？


否定句:
The paralactic effect is not always easy to detect. = 视差效应并不总是容易检测到。
This method does not account for paralactic displacement. = 此方法没有考虑视差位移。


PHRASE->
paralactic angle: 视差角

paralactic ellipse: 视差椭圆
paralactic inequality: 视差不等式
paralactic equation: 视差方程


词源:
From Greek *παράλλαξις (parallaxis, "alteration," "change"), from παρά (para, "beside," "beyond") + ἀλλάξις (allaxís, "change").  The term refers to the apparent change in position of an object due to a change in the observer's position.
