The word "quasi-poorly" does not exist as a standard English word.  It's a combination of "quasi" and "poorly," attempting to create a nuanced description, but it's not lexically established.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  However, we can analyze the component words individually:

**quasi:**

/ˈkwɑːzaɪ/ | adj. |准的，类似的，半的 |  Meaning "to a certain extent," "somewhat," or "resembling." It indicates something that has some of the characteristics of something else but not all. | Example: "The country is in a quasi-war state." 这个国家处于准战争状态。| Near synonyms: semi-, pseudo-, near-, almost- | Antonyms: completely, fully, entirely |


**poorly:**

/ˈpʊrli/ | adv. | 差地，不好地，贫寒地 |  Describing something done badly, inadequately, or in a state of ill health.  | Example 1: "He played the piano poorly." 他钢琴弹得很差。| Example 2: "She's been feeling poorly all week." 她整个星期都感觉不舒服。|Near synonyms: badly, inadequately, insufficiently | Antonyms: well, excellently, superbly |


**Hypothetical Usage of "quasi-poorly"**:

If someone were to *coin* the word "quasi-poorly," they might intend to describe something that is *somewhat* bad or done *somewhat* inadequately, but not entirely so.  For example:

"The project was completed quasi-poorly; while functional, it lacked the polish of previous efforts."  项目完成得马马虎虎；虽然能用，但缺乏以前项目的精细。


Because "quasi-poorly" is not a recognized word,  providing grammatical examples in various tenses, moods, and voices would be artificial and unhelpful.  Similarly, creating phrase examples would be speculative.  The meaning would heavily depend on context and would need to be clearly defined by the user.
