词源:
The word "inconcealable" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not"), the verb "conceal" (meaning "to hide"), and the suffix "-able" (meaning "capable of being").  Therefore, it literally means "not capable of being hidden."  The root "celare" is from Latin, meaning "to hide" or "to conceal".
