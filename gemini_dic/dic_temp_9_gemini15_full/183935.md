词源:
The word "reserving" comes from the Old French word "reserver," meaning "to keep back, reserve." This, in turn, derives from the Latin verb "reservare," which combines the prefix "re-" (again, back) with "servare" (to keep, preserve, save).  Therefore, the core meaning has always been about setting something aside or keeping it for later.
