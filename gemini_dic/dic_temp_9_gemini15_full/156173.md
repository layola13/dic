phragmocone:/ˈfræɡmoʊkoʊn/| n. |隔壁锥|Aphragmocone is a type of shell found in certain extinct cephalopods, particularly ammonoids and nautiloids. It's characterized by its series of chambers separated by septa, which are often ornamented with complex patterns. Unlike the simple, straight chambers of some nautiloids, the chambers in a phragmocone are typically curved or coiled, contributing to the overall shape of the shell. The phragmocone is filled with gas or liquid, helping to control buoyancy and movement in the water.  The animal lived in the outermost chamber, called the body chamber.|The fossil record reveals numerous examples of phragmocones, providing valuable insights into the evolution and ecology of ancient cephalopods.|近义词：septate shell (though less specific)|反义词：无|
