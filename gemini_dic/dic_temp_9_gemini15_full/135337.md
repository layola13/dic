PHRASE->

There are not many common phrases directly using "nonpenetrabilities". The concept is usually expressed using related terms like "high impermeability," "strong resistance to penetration," etc.  However,  we can construct some examples:

degree of nonpenetrabilities  = 不可渗透性程度
testing of nonpenetrabilities = 不可渗透性测试
limits of nonpenetrabilities = 不可渗透性极限
analysis of nonpenetrabilities = 不可渗透性分析
improvement of nonpenetrabilities = 不可渗透性改进
