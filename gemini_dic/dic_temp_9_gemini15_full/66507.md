词源:
The word "exfoliating" comes from the Latin word "exfoliare," which means "to strip off leaves."  The prefix "ex-" means "out" or "off," and "foliare" is related to "folium," meaning "leaf."  The connection to skin care comes from the visual similarity of removing dead skin cells to shedding leaves from a tree.
