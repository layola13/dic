rysimeter:/ˈraɪzɪmiːtər/| n. |蒸渗仪|A lysimeter is a device used to measure the amount of water that evaporates from the soil and the amount of water that percolates through the soil.  It is essentially a container of soil that is carefully monitored to measure water movement.  Lysimeters come in various sizes and designs, depending on the specific research application. |The researchers used a lysimeter to study the evapotranspiration rates of different plant species.|近义词:evaporation pan, soil moisture meter|反义词:None.
