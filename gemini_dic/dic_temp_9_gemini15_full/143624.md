The word "outjinxing" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a newly coined word, a misspelling, or a word from a niche community or slang.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need more context on where you encountered this word.  For example:

* **Source:** Where did you see or hear this word? (e.g., a book, a website, a conversation)
* **Intended meaning:** What do you think the word might mean?

Once you provide this additional information, I can offer a more informed interpretation and possibly a breakdown similar to the requested format, perhaps by considering it as a combination of existing words or offering potential meanings based on context.
