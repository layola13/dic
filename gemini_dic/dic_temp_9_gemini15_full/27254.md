calorimeter:/ˌkæləˈrɪmɪtər/ | n. |量热器 |A calorimeter is a device used to measure the amount of heat released or absorbed during a chemical reaction or physical process.  It works by isolating the reaction or process and precisely measuring the temperature change of the surrounding medium. This temperature change is then used to calculate the heat transfer using known physical constants. |The experiment used a calorimeter to determine the heat of combustion of the fuel.  实验用量热器测定燃料的燃烧热。|calorimetry apparatus, heat meter|  |n.
