The word "ideational" comes from the noun "idea" + the suffix "-ational," which denotes relating to or characterized by.  The root "idea" traces back to the Late Latin *idea, and ultimately to the Ancient Greek word *ἰδέα (idea), meaning "form," "shape," or "appearance."  This Greek word is related to the verb *ἰδεῖν (idein), meaning "to see."  Thus, the original sense of "idea" was connected to the visual perception of a form or pattern, later evolving to encompass mental concepts and notions.
