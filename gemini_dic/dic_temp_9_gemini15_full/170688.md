用法说明：

Pseudoaggressive behavior is a form of indirect aggression.  It's characterized by a lack of direct confrontation, often manifesting as procrastination, subtle sabotage, sulking, or other forms of passive resistance.  The individual expressing pseudoaggressive behavior may appear outwardly compliant or even agreeable, while inwardly harboring resentment or anger.  This makes it more challenging to address than overt aggression.  The term is primarily used in psychology and related fields.
