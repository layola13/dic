词源:

The word "rambunctiousness"  is a relatively modern coinage. It's derived from "rambunctious," which itself is of uncertain origin.  Some etymologists suggest a possible connection to a now-obsolete word meaning "rough" or "boisterous," perhaps with influences from onomatopoeia (words imitating sounds). The "-ousness" suffix simply adds a noun quality, indicating a state or condition.
