由于"half-rise"并非一个标准的英语单词，字典中查不到其定义。它可能是由"half"和"rise"组合而成的合成词，但其含义需要根据上下文推断。  以下提供基于词根的推断和分析：


/ˌhæfˈraɪz/ | adj. n. | 半升，半起，部分上升 |  Describes a partial or incomplete rise, either in a physical or figurative sense.  The exact meaning depends heavily on context. It could refer to a partially risen bread dough, a partially raised structure, or a partial increase in something like prices or temperature. | 例句：The half-rise in the stock market was encouraging, but not enough to quell investor concerns.  股票市场的小幅上涨令人鼓舞，但不足以消除投资者的担忧。


The bread only achieved a half-rise before it was baked. 面包只发酵了一半就烤了。


近义词: partial rise, slight increase, incomplete ascent | 反义词: full rise, complete ascent, total increase


词性:  既可以作为形容词(adj.)修饰名词，也可以作为名词(n.)独立存在。
