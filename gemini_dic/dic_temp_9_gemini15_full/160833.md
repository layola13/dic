词源:  Derived from the adjective "possessive," which comes from the Old French *possessif*, ultimately from Latin *possessio* "possession," from *possidere* "to possess," from *potis* "able" + *sedere* "to sit," implying "to have power over."  The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective into an adverb.
