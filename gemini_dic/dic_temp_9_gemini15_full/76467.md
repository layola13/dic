词源:  The word "gaiters" ultimately derives from the Old French word "galoche," meaning "wooden shoe" or "clog." Over time, the word evolved to refer to various types of footwear coverings, eventually settling on its current meaning of ankle and lower leg coverings.  The spelling shift from "galoche" to "gaiters" reflects phonetic changes and adaptations in English.
