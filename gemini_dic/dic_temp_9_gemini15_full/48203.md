deconcoct:/ˌdiːkənˈkɒkt/| vt.|调制；炮制；编造(谎言)|To concoct means to prepare or make something, especially a drink or a medicine, by mixing different things.  It can also mean to invent or devise something, especially a story or plan.

词源:
The word is formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "to reverse" or "to undo") to the verb "concoct."  "Concoct" comes from the Late Latin word *concoquere*, which means "to cook together," itself from *con-* (together) + *coquere* (to cook).  Therefore, "deconcoct" literally means "to uncook together" or "to take apart what has been cooked together," extending metaphorically to dismantling any complex creation.
