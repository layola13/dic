词源:

The word derives from the verb "chasten," which ultimately comes from the Old French "chastier" meaning "to punish, chastise."  The "-ingly" suffix transforms the verb into an adverb, indicating the manner in which an action is performed.  The evolution reflects a shift in meaning from purely physical punishment to a more nuanced sense of correction and humbling.
