词源:  Derived from the verb "desire" + the adverbial suffix "-ingly".  "Desire" itself comes from Old French *desirer, from Latin *desiderare, from de- ("away from") + sidus ("star").  The original sense was to "long for the stars," implying a reaching for something unattainable or distant.  The "-ingly" suffix transforms the adjective "desiring" into an adverb, modifying verbs to indicate the manner in which an action is performed.
