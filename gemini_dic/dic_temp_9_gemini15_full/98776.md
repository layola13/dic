词源:  The word derives from the verb "interfere," which comes from the Old French "interferir" (to strike against, clash), ultimately from Latin "interferire,"  formed from "inter" (between, among) + "ferire" (to strike). The "-ingly" suffix transforms the verb into an adverb, indicating the manner in which the action is performed.
