词源:
The word "coppers" originates from the Middle English word "coper," which referred to the metal copper.  Since copper was commonly used to make coins (particularly pennies), the term became associated with the coins themselves. The use of "coppers" to refer to police officers is a slang term originating in the 19th century; the association likely stems from the copper buttons historically worn on police uniforms.
