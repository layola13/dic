词源:
The word "reprehensibilities" is derived from the verb "reprehend," which comes from the Latin word "reprehendere," meaning "to reprove," "to rebuke," or "to blame."  The suffix "-ibility" denotes the quality or state of being something, in this case, the quality or state of being deserving of rebuke.  Therefore, "reprehensibilities" refers to the actions or qualities that make something or someone worthy of blame.
