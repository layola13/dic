词源:  Derived from "dandy," which originally meant a man who paid excessive attention to his clothes and appearance.  "Dandy" itself has a complex etymology, possibly originating from a Scottish slang term or even related to the Dutch word "dandt."  The "-ishly" suffix transforms the noun into an adverb, indicating a manner or style.
