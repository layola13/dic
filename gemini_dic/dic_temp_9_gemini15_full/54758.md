词源:
The word "dispatch" comes from the Old French word "despecher," meaning "to hasten," "to send off quickly," or "to expedite."  This ultimately derives from the Latin word "expedire," meaning "to disentangle," "to free," or "to make ready."  The sense of "sending off quickly" evolved from the idea of freeing something up for its journey or purpose.
