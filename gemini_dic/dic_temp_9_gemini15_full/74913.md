词源:
The verb "fret" meaning to worry comes from Old English *frēotan, meaning "to eat away,"  "corrode," or "devour."  The "away" in "fret away" emphasizes the gradual and destructive nature of the worrying.  Therefore, the word's meaning has evolved from a physical process of erosion to a metaphorical one of emotional and mental erosion.
