词源：

* **imply (v.)** :  Comes from the Latin word "implicare," meaning "to enfold, involve, entangle."  This root sense suggests a hidden or indirect connection.

* **-ive (suffix)**: This suffix transforms verbs into adjectives, indicating a quality or tendency.  For example, "active" from "act," "passive" from "pass."

* **-ly (suffix)**: This suffix transforms adjectives into adverbs, indicating manner or way. For example, "quickly" from "quick," "slowly" from "slow."


Therefore, "implicatively" traces its origins back to the Latin "implicare," evolving through the creation of the adjective "implicative" and finally the adverb "implicatively."


用法说明：

"Implicatively" is an adverb that modifies verbs, describing how an action is performed.  It indicates that something is suggested or implied rather than stated directly.  The implication is often indirect, requiring the listener or reader to infer the intended meaning.

The word carries a nuance of subtlety and indirectness. It suggests that the speaker or writer is not being completely transparent, perhaps for reasons of tact, diplomacy, or to avoid direct confrontation.
