The word "calcus" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  It's possible it's:

1. **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word like "calculus," "calyx," or another word entirely.  Please double-check your spelling.

2. **A technical term:** It might be a term used in a very specific field (e.g., a specialized branch of medicine or geology).  If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it would be helpful in determining its meaning.

3. **A neologism or invented word:** It could be a newly coined word, or a word created for a particular purpose (e.g., in fiction).


Without more information, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  If you can provide the context in which you saw "calcus," I can try to assist you further.
