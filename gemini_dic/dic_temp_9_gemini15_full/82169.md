词源:
The origin of "groovy" is uncertain, but it's believed to have emerged in the African American Vernacular English (AAVE) community before gaining wider popularity in the 1960s.  Its earlier meanings possibly related to "groove" in the sense of a rut or furrow, then evolving to imply something smoothly appealing or stylish. The association with the 1960s counterculture solidified its meaning as something excellent or fashionable.
