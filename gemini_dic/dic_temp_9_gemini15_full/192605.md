The word "scunges" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a slang term, a dialect word, or a newly coined word with limited usage.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide the requested analysis, we'd need more context about where you encountered this word.

If you can provide the context (sentence, paragraph, source), it might be possible to offer a more informed guess as to its meaning and intended usage.  Otherwise, I can only suggest possible explanations:

* **Misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of other words.  Possible candidates would depend on the context.

* **Slang or Dialect:** It might be informal slang or a word used within a specific regional dialect or community.  Knowing the geographic location or social group where it was used would help.

* **Neologism:** It could be a newly coined word, perhaps used in a fictional context or within a particular online community.

Please provide more information for a more accurate response.
