词源:
The phrase "cook the books" originates from the practice of literally altering physical accounting ledgers.  Before computerized accounting, financial records were kept in large bound books.  To falsify the records, someone might literally "cook" or alter the entries using methods such as erasing, changing, or adding entries.  The metaphorical meaning of manipulating financial records evolved from this literal practice.
