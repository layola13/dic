词源:
The word "cannoneer" comes from the word "cannon" + "-eer", a suffix that indicates a person who does something.  "Cannon" itself has a complex etymology, ultimately deriving from Old French *canon, referring to a large tube or pipe, and originally from Greek κάννα (kanna), meaning "reed" or "cane".  The association with a large tube for projecting projectiles developed over time.
