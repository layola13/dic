PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases using "quasi-strenuously".  The word is used sparingly due to its somewhat awkward construction.  Instead, one would use more common adverbs like "almost strenuously" or "nearly vigorously".

词源:
The word is a combination of "quasi" (Latin, meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly") and "strenuously" (from "strenuous," derived from Latin "strenuus," meaning "active," "vigorous," or "energetic").  Therefore, "quasi-strenuously" literally means "almost strenuously" or "in a way that is almost strenuous".
