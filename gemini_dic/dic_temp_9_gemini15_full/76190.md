词源:  The word "fussy" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "fuson," meaning "to bustle about," or "to make a fuss."  This older word then evolved through various forms, ultimately leading to the modern adjective "fussy," which now emphasizes the aspect of being overly concerned with details or difficult to please, often linked to a state of irritability.
