probabilist: /ˈprɒbəbɪlɪst/ | /ˈprɑːbəbɪlɪst/ | n. | 概率学家；概率论者 | A probabilist is a mathematician specializing in probability theory.  They study random phenomena and the mathematical frameworks used to model and analyze them. Probabilists develop and apply mathematical methods to quantify uncertainty and make predictions based on probabilistic models. | Example:  Many prominent probabilists contributed to the development of modern statistical mechanics.  许多著名的概率学家为现代统计力学的發展做出了貢獻。|近义词: statistician (in some contexts)|反义词:  (no direct antonym)
