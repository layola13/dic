词源：

From Late Latin *dialecticus, from Greek διαλεκτικός (dialektikós), from διάλεκτος (diálektos, “conversation, discussion, dialect”).  The Greek term ultimately derives from διαλέγεσθαι (dialégesthai, “to converse, discuss”).  The core meaning thus points to a process of reasoned discourse and exchange of ideas.
