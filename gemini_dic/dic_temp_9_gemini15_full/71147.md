词源:

The word "fishwife" is a compound word.  "Fish" refers to the fish they sell, and "wife" historically referred to a woman, often implying a lower social standing or a working-class woman. The term acquired its negative connotation over time, associating it with loud, boisterous, and aggressive behavior.  The evolution of its meaning reflects societal biases against women in certain professions and the use of derogatory terms to describe assertive female behavior.
