interanimates: /ˌɪntərˈænɪmeɪts/ | adj. |互相赋予生命的；相互活化的|  This word is a relatively rare neologism, not found in standard dictionaries. It's likely formed by combining "inter-" (between, among) and "animates" (gives life to; makes lively).  It suggests a reciprocal process of bringing life or energy to each other.  There is no established usage, and its meaning is highly contextual.  Its use would need careful explanation within its specific context. | Example: The two artistic styles, though seemingly disparate, interanimate each other in a surprising and dynamic interplay.  两个看似迥异的艺术风格，却以一种令人惊讶的动态互动方式相互赋予生命。| 近义词:  There aren't direct synonyms, as the word is unique.  One might use phrases like "mutually enliven," "reciprocally vitalize," or "dynamically interact" depending on the context. | 反义词:  There aren't direct antonyms either.
