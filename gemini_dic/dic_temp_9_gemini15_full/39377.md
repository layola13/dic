词源:

Derived from the noun "conjunction," meaning a word or phrase that connects words, phrases, clauses, or sentences.  The suffix "-ally" transforms the noun into an adverb, indicating a manner or way.  The root traces back to Latin "con-" (together) and "jungere" (to join).


用法说明:

Conjunctionally is primarily used to emphasize the simultaneous or interconnected nature of two or more events, actions, or elements.  It highlights the collaborative or combined effect, rather than separate or independent occurrences.  It's less common than words like "jointly" or "simultaneously," but provides a more formal and precise way to convey the idea of things happening together in a coordinated way.
