词源:  The word "opinionist" is a relatively modern coinage, deriving from the noun "opinion" (from Old French  "opinion," ultimately from Latin "opinio")  and the suffix "-ist," indicating a person who does or believes something.  The suffix "-ist" is productive in English, forming nouns denoting practitioners, believers, or adherents to various ideas or practices.
