词源:

The word "opportunist" comes from the French word "opportuniste," which is derived from the Latin word "opportunus," meaning "suitable" or "convenient." The "-ist" suffix indicates a person who engages in a particular practice or holds a particular belief.  The word thus originally referred to someone who acted in a timely or advantageous manner, but it later developed a more negative connotation, associating it with self-serving behavior.
