recursively:/rɪˈkɜːrsɪvli/ | adv. | 递归地，循环地 |  Recursively describes a process or function that calls itself.  It's a common technique in computer science and mathematics to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, self-similar subproblems.  | Example: The function recursively calls itself until it reaches a base case.  递归函数自身调用直到达到基本情况。| 近义词：iteratively, repeatedly | 反义词：iteratively (in a non-self-referential way)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The program recursively searches the directory. = 程序递归地搜索目录。
The function recursively calculates the factorial. = 函数递归地计算阶乘。


一般过去时:
The algorithm recursively sorted the list. = 算法递归地排序了列表。
The program recursively traversed the tree structure. = 程序递归地遍历了树状结构。


现在完成时:
The program has recursively processed all the data. = 程序已经递归地处理了所有数据。
The system has recursively updated the database. = 系统已经递归地更新了数据库。


过去完成时:
The function had recursively computed the result before the timeout. = 函数在超时之前已经递归地计算出了结果。
The process had recursively copied the files before the error occurred. = 在错误发生之前，进程已经递归地复制了文件。


将来时:
The function will recursively calculate the Fibonacci sequence. = 函数将递归地计算斐波那契数列。
The program will recursively find the solution to the puzzle. = 程序将递归地找到谜题的解决方案。


虚拟语气:
If the function were to call itself recursively, it would lead to a stack overflow. = 如果函数递归地调用自身，则会导致堆栈溢出。
If the program recursively processed the data, it would be much more efficient. = 如果程序递归地处理数据，它将会更加高效。


被动语态:
The data was recursively processed by the program. = 数据被程序递归地处理了。
The problem was solved recursively by the algorithm. = 问题由算法递归地解决了。


疑问句:
Does the function call itself recursively? = 函数是否递归地调用自身？
Is the algorithm designed to work recursively? = 该算法是否设计为递归工作？


否定句:
The function does not call itself recursively. = 函数不递归地调用自身。
The program did not recursively search the entire database. = 程序没有递归地搜索整个数据库。


PHRASE->
recursively defined function = 递归定义的函数
recursively enumerable set = 递归可枚举集
recursively solvable problem = 递归可解问题
recursively called procedure = 递归调用的过程
recursive descent parsing = 递归下降分析


词源:
The word "recursively" is derived from the word "recurse," which is formed from the prefix "re-" (again, back) and the verb "curse" (to run).  However, the modern meaning is not directly related to the original meaning of "curse." The "curse" part evolved through "cursus" (Latin for "running"), implying a repeated or cyclical process.  The "re-" prefix emphasizes the repetition.  Therefore, "recursively" means "in a manner of repeatedly running or processing."
