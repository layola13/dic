词源:
The word "outcavils" is derived from the verb "cavil," meaning "to raise trivial objections."  The prefix "out-" intensifies the meaning, indicating an excessive or extreme degree of caviling.  The root of "cavil" is uncertain, but likely of French or Latin origin, possibly related to words suggesting quibbling or fault-finding.
