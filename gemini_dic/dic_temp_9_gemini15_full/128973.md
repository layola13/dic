niobiums:/naɪˈbiːmɪmz/ | n. | 铌（複数形） | Niobiums are a chemical element, a transition metal with the symbol Nb (formerly Cb) and atomic number 41.  It is a hard, gray, ductile metal, and is used in various alloys and applications, particularly in high-strength, low-weight alloys for aerospace applications and superconductors. | Example:  Many high-performance alloys contain niobiums to improve their strength and durability.  许多高性能合金都含有铌以提高其强度和耐久性。 | 近义词: none (as it is a specific element) | 反义词: none (as it is a specific element) | 名词
