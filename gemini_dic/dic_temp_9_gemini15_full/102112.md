isotherms:/ˈaɪsəʊθɜːrmz/ | n. | 等温线 | Lines on a map connecting points of equal temperature.  Isotherms are used in meteorology and climatology to represent the distribution of temperature across a geographical area. They can reveal patterns of temperature variation, such as the influence of latitude, altitude, and ocean currents. | Example: The isotherms on the weather map showed a sharp temperature gradient across the mountain range. 等温线气象图上显示山脉横跨区域的温度梯度急剧变化。|近义词：isopleth (for temperature)|反义词：None specifically, but concepts like "isobars" (lines of equal pressure) represent different meteorological variables. |名词
