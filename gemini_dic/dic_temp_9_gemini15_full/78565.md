ghouls:/ɡuːlz/ | n. | 食尸鬼，恶鬼 | A ghoul is a supernatural being, often depicted as a corpse-eating demon or spirit.  They are typically associated with graveyards, cemeteries, and other places associated with death. In modern usage, the term can also refer to someone who is considered morbid, gruesome, or unpleasant. | Example: The horror movie featured gruesome ghouls rising from their graves.  这部恐怖电影以从坟墓中爬出的可怕食尸鬼为特色。

The legend of the ghoul originated in Arabic folklore as a jinn or evil spirit that roams graveyards and feeds on corpses.  This imagery was later adopted and adapted by Western cultures, resulting in the modern understanding of ghouls as monstrous creatures.
