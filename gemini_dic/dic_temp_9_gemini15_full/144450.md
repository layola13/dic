词源:

The word "outswindling" is a combination of "out-" (meaning completely or thoroughly) and "swindle".  "Swindle" itself originates from the Middle English word "swinden," meaning to go away or disappear.  Over time, its meaning shifted to describe the act of deceiving someone for financial gain.  The "out-" prefix intensifies the meaning, suggesting a more complete or decisive act of swindling.
