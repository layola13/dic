diploidal: /dɪˈplɔɪdəl/ | adj. | 二倍体的；双倍体的 | Having two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent.  A diploid cell or organism has paired chromosomes, one chromosome of each pair from each parent. This is in contrast to haploid, which has only one set of chromosomes. | Example:  Human somatic cells are diploid, containing 23 pairs of chromosomes. 人体体细胞是二倍体，含有23对染色体。

The term "diploid" is derived from the Greek words "diploos" (διπλοῦς), meaning "double," and "eidos" (εἶδος), meaning "form" or "kind."  It refers to the doubled set of chromosomes characteristic of most somatic cells in sexually reproducing organisms.

近义词:  doubled, paired

反义词: haploid
