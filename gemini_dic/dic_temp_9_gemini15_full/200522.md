词源:
The word "slapdash" is of uncertain origin.  It's believed to be a combination of "slap" (to strike or hit with the hand) and "dash" (to move or act quickly and forcefully). This suggests a hurried and careless manner of doing things.  The implication is that things are done quickly and without proper care or attention to detail, like someone slapping things together in a rush.
