preharmonies:/ˌpriːˈhɑːrməniz/| n.| 预先和谐；前奏和谐 |  The word "preharmonies" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word.  It combines the prefix "pre-" (meaning before) with "harmonies," suggesting musical or compositional elements that precede and establish a sense of harmony later in a piece.  The meaning would depend heavily on context. For example, it might refer to preliminary chords or melodic fragments that hint at the overall harmony of a musical work.  A composer might use the term in their notes or analysis. | Example: The composer meticulously crafted the preharmonies, ensuring a smooth transition into the main theme.  作曲家精心制作了前奏和谐，确保平稳过渡到主旋律。| 近义词:  preludes, introductions, anticipations | 反义词:  dissonances, clashes, aftereffects | 名词
