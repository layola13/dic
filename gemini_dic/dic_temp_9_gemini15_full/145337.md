词源：
The word is a combination of "over-" (meaning excessively or to an excessive degree) and "brutalizing" (the present participle of "brutalize," meaning to treat with cruelty or savagery).  The root "brutal" comes from the Old French "brutal," ultimately deriving from the Latin "brūtus," meaning "stupid, dull, senseless," but later taking on the connotation of "savage, ferocious."
