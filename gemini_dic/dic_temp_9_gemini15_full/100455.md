词源:

The word "intertwinements" is derived from the verb "intertwine," which itself combines the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and the verb "twine" (meaning "to twist or wind together").  Therefore, "intertwine" means "to twist or wind together," and "intertwinements" is the noun form, referring to the result of this action or the state of being intertwined.
