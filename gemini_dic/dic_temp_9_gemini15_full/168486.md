词源:
From the Middle English word *proben*, meaning "to test, try," from the Old French word *prober*,  meaning "to test, try, prove," ultimately deriving from the Latin word *probare*, meaning "to test, try, prove".  The modern English sense of "to explore or investigate thoroughly" developed later.
