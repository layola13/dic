词源:
The word "scrupulous" comes from the Latin word "scrūpulus," meaning "a small sharp stone," or "a pebble."  This referred to a small obstacle or difficulty.  The sense evolved to mean a feeling of doubt or hesitation, often relating to moral questions.  Over time, the word took on its current meaning of being diligent and careful, often with a moral dimension.


用法说明:

Scrupulous can describe both a person's actions and their character.  When describing actions, it highlights the meticulousness and attention to detail involved. When describing character, it emphasizes their strong moral principles and honesty.  The word often carries a positive connotation, implying a high level of integrity and commitment to doing things correctly.

However, in some contexts, "scrupulous" can also imply an excessive concern for detail, potentially hindering progress or efficiency.  This usage is less common but should be kept in mind.
