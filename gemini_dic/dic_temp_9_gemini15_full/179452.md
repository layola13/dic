词源:
The word "redundancy" originates from the Latin word "redundantia," which is a combination of "red-" (back, again) and "undare" (to flow, to wave).  The original sense implied an overflowing or surplus.  The modern English meaning evolved from this etymological root, encompassing both literal and figurative excesses.
