The word "nonvalidations" is a compound word formed from:

* "non-": a prefix meaning "not" or "absence of"
* "validations": the plural of "validation," which comes from the verb "validate" (to confirm or verify the validity or accuracy of something).  "Validate" ultimately derives from the Latin word "validus," meaning "strong" or "powerful."
