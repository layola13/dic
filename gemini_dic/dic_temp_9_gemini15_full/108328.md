lautverschiebung:/ˈlaʊtvərˌʃiːbʊŋ/| n. |音变|The term "Lautverschiebung" is a German word meaning "sound shift."  It refers to a systematic change in the pronunciation of consonants that occurred in Proto-Germanic, distinguishing it from other Indo-European languages.  This shift is crucial in understanding the historical development of Germanic languages, including English, German, and others.  The most well-known aspect involves the shift of voiceless stops (p, t, k) to voiceless fricatives (f, θ, h) in certain contexts. |The Great German Consonant Shift, or Grimm's Law, is an example of Lautverschiebung.  This shift helps explain why the English word "father" is cognate with the German word "Vater," even though their initial consonants appear different.  |近义词：sound change, consonant shift |反义词：sound preservation,  (no direct antonym, as it describes a specific historical process)|
