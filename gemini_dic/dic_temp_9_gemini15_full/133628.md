/ˌnɑːnˈfɒrɪnəsnɪsiːz/ | n. | 非外来性；非外国特征 | The absence of foreign characteristics or influences; the state of being not foreign.  This word is extremely rare and largely theoretical, created by adding the prefix "non-" to "foreignnesses". It lacks common usage and established definitions beyond its literal meaning.  There are no readily available examples in standard corpora. | 近义词:  indigeneity, nativeness | 反义词: foreignness, exoticism


USAGE->
This word is so rare that providing grammatical examples across tenses is impractical and unhelpful.  The word's usage would mirror that of "foreignness" with the addition of negation.

For instance, consider the sentence:  "The committee noted the nonforeignnesses of the design, praising its adherence to local traditions."  This would mean the design lacked foreign influences.

PHRASE->
Because the word is so rare, no common phrases exist.
