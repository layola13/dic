The word "hulan" is not found in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical explanation are impossible.  It's likely a proper noun (a name or place), a word from a specific dialect or language, or a neologism (newly coined word).  To provide the requested information, more context is needed.  For example:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (A book, a website, a conversation, etc.)
* **What was the context of its use?** (This will help determine its meaning and grammatical function.)

Without this information, I can only offer a generic template showing what the response *would* look like if "hulan" were a standard English word.
