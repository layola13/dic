isotherm:/ˈaɪsəʊθɜːrm/|/ˈaɪsoʊθɜːrm/| n. |等温线|A line on a map connecting points of equal temperature.  Isotherms are used in meteorology and climatology to represent temperature patterns across geographical areas.  They can show the distribution of temperature at a specific time or as an average over a period.  | Example: The isotherms on this map show a significant temperature gradient between the coast and the inland regions.  这个地图上的等温线显示了海岸地区和内陆地区之间明显的温度梯度。|近义词：isopleth (for lines of equal value)|反义词：None directly;  the concept is relative to differing temperatures.


USAGE->
