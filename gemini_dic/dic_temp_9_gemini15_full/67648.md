extrinsicism: /ɛkˈstrɪnsɪˌsɪzəm/ | n. | 外在主义；外部论 | The philosophical view that emphasizes external factors in determining meaning, value, or truth.  It contrasts with intrinsicism, which focuses on inherent qualities.  Extrinsicism often appears in discussions of value (e.g., moral or aesthetic value), meaning (e.g., the meaning of a word or a life), and truth (e.g., the truth of a statement). | Example:  The critic argued for an extrinsicist approach to art, emphasizing the social and historical context of the artwork rather than its inherent qualities.  = 批评家主张对艺术采取外在主义的方法，强调艺术品的社会和历史背景，而不是其内在品质。


Example: Some philosophers advocate extrinsicism, claiming that the meaning of a word is determined by its use in a community rather than by its inherent properties. = 一些哲学家倡导外在主义，声称一个词的意义是由其在社区中的使用决定的，而不是由其固有的属性决定的。
