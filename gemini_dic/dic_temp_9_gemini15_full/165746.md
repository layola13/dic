preneural: /ˌpriːˈnjʊərəl/ | adj. | 前神经的；神经之前的 | Relating to the period or structures before the development of the nervous system.  This term is used primarily in developmental biology and neuroscience to describe the stages of embryonic development preceding the formation of the nervous system.  | Example: Preneural development in vertebrates involves the formation of the three primary germ layers.  前神经发育在脊椎动物中包括三个主要胚层的形成。| 近义词:  prenervous (less common)| 反义词: postneural


USAGE->
This word is primarily used as an adjective, and therefore doesn't have verb conjugations.  The grammatical uses would be consistent with any other adjective.
