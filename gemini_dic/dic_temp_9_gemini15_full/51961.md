diacid: /ˈdaɪæsɪd/ | n. |二元酸|A diacid is an acid containing two acidic hydrogen atoms per molecule, capable of donating two protons (H⁺) in an acid-base reaction.  These acids often have two carboxyl groups (-COOH) or other acidic functional groups. |Example: Oxalic acid is a diacid, readily donating two protons. 草酸是一种二元酸，可以很容易地给出两个质子。|近义词: dibasic acid |反义词: monobasic acid


USAGE->
