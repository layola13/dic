This is typically done in a violent or brutal manner, often as part of torture or a gruesome act.

近义词：eviscerate (more formal), disembowel (synonym)


反义词：  There isn't a direct antonym, as the action is inherently destructive.  One might use words suggesting preservation or restoration, depending on the context.  For example,  "repair," "restore," or "heal" could be used in a contrasting sense if referring to the opposite of damage caused by disbowelling.


词性: Verb (transitive)


词源:  The word is a combination of the prefix "dis-" (meaning "apart," "away," or "reverse") and "bowel" (referring to the intestines).  Therefore, it literally means "to remove the bowels."  The word's origins trace back to the Old English word "bogel," meaning "belly" or "intestines."  The prefix "dis-" has roots in Latin.
