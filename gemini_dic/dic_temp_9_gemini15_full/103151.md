词源:

The term "gerrymandering" is a portmanteau of "Gerry" and "mandering".  "Gerry" refers to Elbridge Gerry, the Governor of Massachusetts (1810-1812), whose administration created a bizarrely shaped electoral district in 1812.  "Mandering" is derived from the word "mander," meaning to manipulate or manage.  The oddly shaped district resembled a salamander, leading to the satirical cartoon and the term's creation.
