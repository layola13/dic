The word "fermerere" is not a word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?  Providing the context where you encountered this word would be helpful.

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, a term specific to a certain community or field, or slang not yet widely recognized.

3. **It's from another language:** It might be a word from a different language, possibly with a similar-sounding English equivalent.  If you can provide the language of origin, I may be able to assist you.

Without knowing the correct spelling or context, I cannot provide the requested information (pronunciation, word class, meaning, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc.).  Please provide more information so I can help.
