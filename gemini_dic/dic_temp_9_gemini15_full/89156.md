词源:
The word "homeliest" is the superlative form of "homely," which ultimately derives from "home."  The original meaning was "simple, plain, unpretentious," reflecting the simplicity often associated with a home. Over time, the meaning shifted to also include the connotation of lacking elegance or refinement, especially in relation to appearance.
