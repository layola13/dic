A high genotypicity suggests a strong genetic component, while a low genotypicity indicates a greater influence from environmental factors. |Example:  The study investigated the genotypicity of plant height, finding a high correlation between specific genes and plant size.  这项研究调查了植物高度的基因型性，发现特定基因与植物大小之间存在高度相关性。|近义词:heritability, genetic determination|反义词:environmental influence, phenotypic plasticity|名词
