词源:
The word "desperately" comes from the adjective "desperate," which originates from the Old French word "desperer," meaning "to lose hope."  "Desperer" itself is formed from the prefix "de-" (meaning "away from" or "without") and "esperer" (meaning "to hope"). Therefore, "desperate" literally means "without hope." The adverbial form "-ly" is added to create "desperately," modifying verbs and phrases to express the intensity of hopelessness or urgency.
