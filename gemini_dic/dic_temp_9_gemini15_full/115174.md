PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "manic-depressives" as a core component.  The term is primarily used descriptively within clinical or informal contexts.  Instead, phrases would revolve around the condition itself (bipolar disorder) or its symptoms.  Examples:

experiencing manic episodes
suffering from depression
mood swings
bipolar disorder treatment
mental health support


词源:
The term is a compound word. "Manic" derives from the Greek word "μανικός" (manikos), meaning "mad" or "insane," relating to the manic phase of bipolar disorder. "Depressive" is derived from "depress," ultimately from the Latin "deprimere," meaning "to press down," reflecting the depressive phase.  "Depressives" functions as a noun here, referring to those experiencing depression.  The combined term describes individuals experiencing both phases.
