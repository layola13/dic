词源:
The phrasal verb "go through with" originates from the combination of the verb "go" and the prepositional phrase "through with."  "Go" indicates movement or action, while "through with" implies completion or finishing something. The sense of overcoming obstacles or reluctance is implied in the context of the phrase.  The etymology is straightforward, based on established meanings of the individual words, rather than originating from a specific historical source.
