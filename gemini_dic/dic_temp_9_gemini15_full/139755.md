The word "ocreate" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to your requested format is not possible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or technical field.  If you can provide more context on where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more informed response.
