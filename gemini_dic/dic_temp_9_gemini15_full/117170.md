The word "mear" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Please double-check the spelling.
* **It's a dialect word or archaic term:**  It might be a word used in a specific region or a historical word no longer in common usage.  If you encountered it in a specific context (book, conversation, etc.), providing that context would help.
* **It's a proper noun:** It could be a name or place name.

Please provide more information or correct the spelling for a proper analysis.
