词源:

The word "nonservile" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "servile" (meaning "of or relating to a slave; slavishly submissive").  "Servile" itself derives from the Latin word "servus," meaning "slave." Therefore, "nonservile" literally means "not like a slave" or "not submissive."
