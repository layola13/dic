The word "shikaree" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a word from a specific dialect, or a word borrowed from another language.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis cannot be provided.  To provide the requested analysis, I need a correctly spelled and commonly used English word.
