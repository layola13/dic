WORD ORIGIN->

The word is formed from:

* **non-**: a prefix meaning "not"
* **deprecating**:  from the verb "deprecate," meaning to express disapproval of; to belittle.  This comes from Latin *deprecāri* "to pray against, avert," from *de-* "away" + *precari* "to pray, beg."

Therefore, "nondeprecatingly" means "in a way that does not express disapproval or belittlement."
