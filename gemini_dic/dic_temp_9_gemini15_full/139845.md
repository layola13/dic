octoradiated: /ˌɒktəʊˈreɪdieɪtɪd/ | adj. | 经过八次辐射的；八次辐射照射的 |  Describes something that has been subjected to radiation eight times.  This word is a combination of "octo-" (eight) and "radiated" (subjected to radiation). It's a rare and highly specialized term, primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly in fields like nuclear physics or radiation oncology.  There isn't a common usage for this word outside of these specialized fields.  Therefore, providing examples in everyday language is not practical.
