词源:
The word "cherry" comes from the Old French word "cherise," which in turn is derived from the Latin word "cerasus."  "Cerasus" referred to the cherry tree, and its origins trace back to the ancient Greek word "kerasos," ultimately from the town of Cerasus on the Black Sea coast, where cherries were cultivated.
