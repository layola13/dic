The word "coten" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), a technical term from a specific field, or a word from a dialect or language other than English.

To provide a helpful response, please clarify:

* **Did you misspell a word?**  If so, please provide the word you intended to use.
* **Is it a technical term?** If so, please specify the field (e.g., law, medicine, engineering).
* **Is it a word from another language?** If so, please specify the language.

Once you provide this additional information, I can offer a proper analysis.
