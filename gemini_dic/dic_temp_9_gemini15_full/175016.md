radio-telescopes:/ˈreɪdioʊ ˈtɛləskoʊps/| n. |射电望远镜|A radio telescope is a large parabolic antenna used to receive radio waves from astronomical objects. Unlike optical telescopes that collect visible light, radio telescopes detect radio emissions from space, providing information about celestial bodies that cannot be seen with optical telescopes.  They are crucial tools in radio astronomy, allowing scientists to study various aspects of the universe, such as pulsars, quasars, and the cosmic microwave background radiation.|Example: The Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico housed one of the largest single-dish radio telescopes in the world.|近义词：radio antenna, radio receiver|反义词：optical telescope
