词源:
The word "cool" originally meant "slightly cold," and its transition to describing something fashionable or excellent occurred in the mid-20th century, particularly within African American Vernacular English (AAVE).  The superlative form "-est" is a standard English grammatical suffix added to create the highest degree of comparison.
