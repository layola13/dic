英文解析:Painstakingnesses is the plural form of painstakingness,  which refers to the quality of being painstaking; characterized by or showing great care and thoroughness. It implies a significant amount of effort and attention to detail, often to the point of being laborious.


例句:

The artist's painstakingnesses were evident in every brushstroke of the painting.  = 画家的细致入微在画作的每一笔笔触中都显而易见。

The report showcased the painstakingnesses of the research team, who spent years compiling data. = 这份报告展示了研究团队的细致工作，他们花了数年时间收集数据。


词源:

The word is derived from "painstaking," which itself combines "pain" (meaning effort or difficulty) and "taking" (meaning the act of doing something).  The suffix "-ness" adds the quality or state of being. Therefore, painstakingnesses signifies the state of being extremely careful and thorough, often involving considerable effort.
