词源:
The word "paedophiliac" is derived from the Greek words "pais" (παις), meaning "child," and "philia" (φιλία), meaning "love" or "friendship," combined with the suffix "-iac," indicating a person or thing characterized by a particular quality.  Therefore, it literally means "child-loving," though the term's modern usage carries highly negative connotations due to its association with sexual abuse.  The term "pedophile" is a more common and often preferred term, avoiding the archaic spelling of "paedophile".
