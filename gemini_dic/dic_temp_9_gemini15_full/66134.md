词源:

The word "exceptional" comes from the Latin word "exceptio," meaning "exception" or "exclusion."  It developed through the Old French word "excepcioun" before entering English. The "-al" suffix indicates an adjectival form, meaning "relating to" or "characterized by."  Therefore, "exceptional" originally meant "forming an exception," but its meaning shifted to emphasize the positive aspects of being unusual or outstanding.
