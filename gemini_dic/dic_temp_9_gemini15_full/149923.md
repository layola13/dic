词源:
The word "pallet" comes from the Old French word "palette," meaning "small flat board," ultimately deriving from the Latin word "palea," meaning "straw."  The original meaning referred to a small, flat board used by artists (a painter's palette), and the meaning expanded to include the larger platforms used for shipping and storage.
