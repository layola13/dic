racemate:/ˈreɪsɪmeɪt/| n. | 外消旋体；消旋混合物 | A racemate is a mixture of equal amounts of the left-handed and right-handed enantiomers of a chiral molecule.  It is optically inactive because the rotations of the enantiomers cancel each other out. | Example: The synthesis yielded a racemate of the drug, requiring further separation to obtain the active enantiomer.  合成得到药物的外消旋体，需要进一步分离才能获得活性对映体。|近义词：racemic mixture |反义词：enantiomer, pure enantiomer
