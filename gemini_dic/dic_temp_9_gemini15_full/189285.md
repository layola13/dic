词源:
From the name of the Austrian physician Leopold von Sacher-Masoch (1836–1895), who wrote about deriving pleasure from being subjected to pain (masochism), and whose name was later used to coin the term "sadism" to describe the opposite behavior.  The term was coined by Richard von Krafft-Ebing in his book Psychopathia Sexualis (1886).
