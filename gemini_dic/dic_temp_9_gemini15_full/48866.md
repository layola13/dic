deformers:/dɪˈfɔːrmərz/ | n. |变形器，形变器 |  Components or processes that alter the shape or form of something, often used in computer graphics, animation, and engineering.  They can manipulate meshes, surfaces, or other geometric data to create various effects. | Example:  The animators used advanced deformers to create realistic facial expressions.  动画师使用先进的变形器来创建逼真的面部表情。|近义词：modifiers, distorters, warpers |反义词：restorers, stabilizers |名词

The artists had experimented with different deformers before settling on the best one. = 在确定最佳变形器之前，艺术家们尝试过不同的变形器。


将来时:
The next update will include improved deformers for cloth simulation. = 下次更新将包括改进的布料模拟变形器。
We will use more sophisticated deformers to create more realistic characters. = 我们将使用更复杂的变形器来创建更逼真的角色。


虚拟语气:
If we had better deformers, the animation would look more natural. = 如果我们有更好的变形器，动画看起来会更自然。
I wish we had access to more powerful deformers for this project. = 我希望我们能够在这个项目中使用更强大的变形器。


被动语态:
The mesh was deformed using various types of deformers. = 网格是使用各种类型的变形器进行变形的。
The animation quality was greatly enhanced by the sophisticated deformers. = 精密的变形器极大地提高了动画质量。


疑问句:
What types of deformers are available in this software? = 此软件中有哪些类型的变形器？
Which deformers are best suited for this particular animation task? = 哪些变形器最适合这项特定的动画任务？


否定句:
The model wasn't deformed enough using the existing deformers. = 使用现有的变形器，模型变形不足。
They didn't use deformers to create the effect; they did it manually. = 他们没有使用变形器来创建效果；他们手动完成的。
