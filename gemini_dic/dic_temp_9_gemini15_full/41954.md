cosmotheism:/ˈkɒzməθiːɪzəm/ | n. |宇宙神论，泛神论 |Cosmotheism is a philosophical viewpoint that identifies the cosmos (the universe) with God.  It asserts that the universe itself is divine, or that God is immanent in the universe and inseparable from it. Unlike pantheism, which often views God as being *in* everything, cosmotheism often suggests a more direct equivalence: the universe *is* God.  This can lead to varying interpretations, some emphasizing the immanence of God, others focusing on the divinity of the universe itself. |Example:  Some interpretations of Spinoza's philosophy are seen as forms of cosmotheism, where God and nature are considered identical.  |近义词: pantheism, panentheism |反义词: atheism, deism
