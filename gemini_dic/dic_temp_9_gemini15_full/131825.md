nonconserving: /ˌnɒnkənˈsɜːvɪŋ/ | adj. | 不守恒的，非守恒的 | Not conserving; failing to conserve something, especially energy or a resource.  | Example: The nonconserving algorithm uses significantly more memory.  非守恒算法使用了更多的内存。 The nonconserving process resulted in a significant loss of energy.  非守恒过程导致了大量的能量损失。 |近义词: dissipative, wasteful | 反义词: conserving, conservative


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The system is nonconserving in its energy usage. = 这个系统在能源使用方面是非守恒的。
This process is nonconserving of resources. = 这个过程不节约资源。


一般过去时:
The experiment demonstrated a nonconserving reaction. = 实验表明这是一个非守恒反应。
The old machine was nonconserving of electricity. = 老机器耗电量很大（非守恒）。


现在完成时:
The company has implemented a nonconserving production method. = 公司已经实施了一种不节约资源的生产方法。
The project has shown itself to be nonconserving of time. = 项目证明其浪费时间（非守恒）。


过去完成时:
They had realized the algorithm was nonconserving before the deadline. = 他们在截止日期前已经意识到该算法是非守恒的。
The engineers had discovered the system was nonconserving of fuel. = 工程师们已经发现该系统耗油量很大（非守恒）。


将来时:
The new design will be more nonconserving of resources than the old one. = 新设计将比旧设计更浪费资源（非守恒）。
We anticipate that the new process will be nonconserving in terms of energy. = 我们预计新过程在能源方面将是非守恒的。


虚拟语气:
If the process were nonconserving, we would have to redesign it. = 如果这个过程是非守恒的，我们就必须重新设计它。
I wish the algorithm were not so nonconserving of memory. = 我希望该算法不要这么浪费内存。


被动语态:
The energy loss was shown to be caused by a nonconserving process. = 能量损失被证明是由非守恒过程引起的。
The system's inefficiency was attributed to its nonconserving design. = 系统的低效率归因于其非守恒的设计。


疑问句:
Is the proposed method truly nonconserving of resources? = 提出的方法真的不节约资源吗？
Are there any nonconserving aspects to this new technology?  这项新技术是否存在任何非守恒的方面？


否定句:
The system is not nonconserving; it's actually quite efficient. = 该系统并非非守恒的；它实际上相当高效。
The reaction is not nonconserving; it obeys the law of conservation of energy. = 该反应并非非守恒的；它遵循能量守恒定律。


PHRASE->
nonconserving algorithm: 非守恒算法
nonconserving process: 非守恒过程
nonconserving reaction: 非守恒反应
nonconserving system: 非守恒系统
