词源:

The word "settlement" comes from the Old French word "settlement," which means "to settle" or "to establish."  This in turn derives from the Latin word "sedimentum," which means "settling" or "a deposit." The modern English meaning developed gradually over centuries, encompassing both the physical act of settling in a place and the resolution of conflicts.
