The word "semilor" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized field.  If you can provide more context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more informed guess.
