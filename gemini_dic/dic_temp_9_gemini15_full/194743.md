反义词：different, dissimilar, unlike

词源:  The word is a compound of "self" and "same," reflecting its meaning of being the very same thing.  Both "self" and "same" have long histories in English, tracing back to Proto-Germanic and Proto-Indo-European roots.

用法说明:

selfsame is primarily used as an adjective, modifying a noun to emphasize its absolute identity.  It is a more emphatic and slightly archaic version of "the same" or "identical."  Its use often adds a touch of formality or literary style.  Overuse can sound overly emphatic or stiff.
