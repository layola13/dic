naphthide: /ˈnæfθaɪd/ | n. |萘负离子 | A naphthide is an anionic species derived from naphthalene, containing a negatively charged naphthalene ring.  It's a highly reactive organometallic compound used in certain organic synthesis reactions.  It's rarely encountered outside of specialized chemical research. | Example:  The reaction of naphthalene with a strong reducing agent yielded the naphthide anion. 萘与强还原剂反应生成萘负离子。 | 近义词:  (No direct synonyms, as it's a specific chemical species) | 反义词: (No direct antonyms)
