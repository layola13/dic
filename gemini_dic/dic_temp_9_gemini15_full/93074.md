词源:
The word "idoloclast" is a combination of two Greek words:

* **eidōlon (εἴδωλον):** meaning "image," "idol," or "phantom."
* **klastēs (κλαστής):** meaning "breaker" or "destroyer."


Therefore, the word literally means "idol breaker" or "image destroyer," reflecting its meaning as someone who attacks or destroys established beliefs or institutions.
