/ˌmaɪkroʊˈzoʊəspɔːr/ | n. | 微动孢子 | A microzoo spore is a microscopic, motile spore produced by some microorganisms, typically found in aquatic environments.  It is a stage in the life cycle of certain organisms, allowing for dispersal and survival in harsh conditions. | Example: The researchers discovered several species of microzoo spores in the sediment samples from the lake.  研究人员在湖泊沉积物样本中发现了数种微动孢子。 | 近义词: zoospore (a more general term) | 反义词: N/A


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in scientific contexts, particularly within microbiology and aquatic ecology.  Therefore, grammatical tense usage depends entirely on the context of the scientific writing or discussion.  Examples below illustrate possible uses:


Present Simple:  Microzoo spores are crucial for the dispersal of certain aquatic fungi. 微动孢子对于某些水生真菌的传播至关重要。
Present Perfect:  Scientists have recently identified a new species of microzoo spore in the Amazon River. 科学家最近在亚马逊河中发现了一种新的微动孢子物种。


Past Simple:  The experiment demonstrated that microzoo spore germination was inhibited by high salinity. 实验表明高盐度抑制了微动孢子的萌发。
Past Perfect: The researchers had already observed the microzoo spores before they started the experiment. 研究人员在开始实验之前就已经观察到微动孢子了。


Future Simple:  Further research will investigate the role of microzoo spores in the nutrient cycling of the ecosystem.  进一步的研究将调查微动孢子在生态系统养分循环中的作用。
Future Perfect: By next year, we will have completed the analysis of the microzoo spores collected from the expedition. 到明年，我们将完成对探险队收集的微动孢子的分析。


Conditional: If the water temperature increases, the microzoo spores may not survive. 如果水温升高，微动孢子可能无法存活。
Conditional Perfect: If the water temperature had been lower, the microzoo spores would have germinated. 如果水温更低，微动孢子就会萌发。



Passive Voice: The microzoo spores were observed under a microscope. 微动孢子在显微镜下观察。
Passive Voice Perfect: The presence of microzoo spores had been confirmed by DNA analysis. 微动孢子的存在已通过DNA分析得到证实。


PHRASE->
Due to the specialized nature of the word, common phrases are not applicable in the same way as for common words.  Instead, relevant phrases would involve scientific terminology related to the life cycle, morphology, or ecology of the organism producing the microzoo spores.  Examples could be:


"Microzoo spore germination rates" 微动孢子萌发率
"Microzoo spore morphology" 微动孢子形态
"Microzoo spore dispersal mechanisms" 微动孢子传播机制
"Microzoo spore ecological significance" 微动孢子的生态意义
"Microzoo spore population dynamics" 微动孢子种群动态
