词源:
The word "humility" comes from the Latin word "humilitas," meaning "lowliness," "humility," or "groundliness."  This in turn is derived from "humilis," meaning "low," "humble," or "near the ground."  The evolution of the word reflects the concept of humility as a state of being low or unassuming.
