quintelligence:/kwɪnˈtɛlɪdʒəns/| n. |五元智能；五重智能|The term "quintelligence" is a neologism, a newly coined word, not yet widely accepted or defined in standard dictionaries.  It's likely a combination of "quin-" (meaning five) and "intelligence," suggesting a model of intelligence encompassing five distinct components or aspects.  The specific components would need to be defined within the context where the term is used. There is no established definition or widely accepted meaning for "quintelligence". It could potentially refer to a theoretical framework combining five types of intelligence, such as linguistic, logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, and interpersonal intelligence (as in Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences), or it could refer to five levels or stages of intelligence.  Further context is needed for precise understanding. |例句：The researcher proposed a model of quintelligence, incorporating emotional, social, cognitive, creative, and practical intelligence. (研究人员提出了一种五元智能模型，其中包含情感、社会、认知、创造力和实践智能。)  |近义词:  multiple intelligence, five-fold intelligence (depending on the specific definition)|反义词:  None directly applicable, as the meaning is context-dependent.
