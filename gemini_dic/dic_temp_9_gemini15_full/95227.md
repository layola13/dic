inbreeding's: /ˈɪnˌbriːdɪŋz/ | n. | 近亲繁殖的结果 | The effects of inbreeding, such as increased risk of genetic disorders. | 近义词：consanguinity, close breeding | 反义词：outcrossing


英文解析：Inbreeding's refers to the consequences or results of inbreeding, which is the breeding of closely related individuals.  It often leads to a higher chance of recessive genes manifesting, potentially causing genetic disorders or weaknesses in the offspring.  The term is typically used in biology, genetics, and animal husbandry.


例句：

The study highlighted the detrimental inbreeding's observed in the isolated population.  这项研究强调了在孤立种群中观察到的有害的近亲繁殖结果。


The farmer was concerned about the negative inbreeding's affecting his herd's health.  这位农民担心负面的近亲繁殖结果影响了他的牛群健康。


USAGE->

一般现在时:

The inbreeding's of this population are well documented.  这个种群的近亲繁殖结果已被充分记录。

These inbreeding's show a clear link to the high rate of genetic diseases. 这些近亲繁殖的结果清楚地表明与高发病率的遗传疾病有关。


一般过去时:

The inbreeding's of the previous generation were devastating.  上一代的近亲繁殖结果是毁灭性的。

Scientists studied the inbreeding's that occurred in the wild dog pack. 科学家研究了野生犬群中发生的近亲繁殖结果。


现在完成时:

The inbreeding's have significantly reduced the genetic diversity of the species.  近亲繁殖的结果已大大降低了该物种的遗传多样性。

Researchers have documented numerous negative inbreeding's in isolated communities. 研究人员已经记录了在孤立社区中许多负面的近亲繁殖结果。


过去完成时:

Before the conservation program, the inbreeding's had already caused significant damage. 在保护项目开始之前，近亲繁殖的结果已经造成了严重的损害。

They realized that the inbreeding's had weakened the entire population. 他们意识到近亲繁殖的结果已经削弱了整个种群。


将来时:

Further inbreeding's will likely lead to more genetic problems.  进一步的近亲繁殖很可能会导致更多的遗传问题。

We predict that the inbreeding's will become increasingly apparent in future generations. 我们预测，近亲繁殖的结果将在未来的几代人中变得越来越明显。


虚拟语气:

If there had been less inbreeding's, the population would be healthier. 如果近亲繁殖较少，种群会更健康。

It's a shame that the inbreeding's were so extensive; the breed might have been saved. 近亲繁殖如此广泛，真是可惜；这个品种本来可以被拯救。


被动语态:

The detrimental inbreeding's were highlighted in the report.  报告中强调了有害的近亲繁殖结果。

The long-term effects of these inbreeding's are still being studied.  这些近亲繁殖结果的长期影响仍在研究中。


疑问句:

What are the most significant inbreeding's observed in this study?  在这项研究中观察到的最重要的近亲繁殖结果是什么？

Are there any visible inbreeding's in this animal population?  在这个动物种群中是否有任何明显的近亲繁殖结果？


否定句:

There were no obvious inbreeding's apparent in the initial examination.  在初步检查中没有发现明显的近亲繁殖结果。

The study found that there were fewer negative inbreeding's than initially predicted.  研究发现，负面的近亲繁殖结果比最初预测的要少。


PHRASE->

There are no common phrases specifically using "inbreeding's" as a noun phrase. The focus is usually on the act of inbreeding itself or its consequences.  Instead, phrases would revolve around the effects, such as:  "signs of inbreeding depression," "evidence of inbreeding," "risks of inbreeding,"  "genetic consequences of inbreeding," "reducing inbreeding."
