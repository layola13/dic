The word "dividually" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries like Merriam-Webster, Oxford English Dictionary, or Cambridge Dictionary.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word not yet widely accepted.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis as requested.  If you meant a different word, please provide the correct spelling.
