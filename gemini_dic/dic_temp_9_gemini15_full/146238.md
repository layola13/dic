overexpresses:/ˌoʊvərɪkˈsprɛsɪz/ | v. |过度表达，超量表达 |To express (a gene or protein) at a higher than normal level.  This typically happens due to genetic mutations, gene amplification, or other regulatory mechanisms. |例句：The cancer cells overexpresses the HER2 protein.  癌细胞过度表达HER2蛋白。|例句：The experiment showed that the plant overexpresses a specific enzyme under stress conditions. 实验表明，该植物在胁迫条件下过度表达一种特定酶。|近义词：hyperexpress, upregulate |反义词：underexpress, downregulate
