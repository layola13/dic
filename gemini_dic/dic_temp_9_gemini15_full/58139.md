/drɒˈsɒfɪliː/ | n. |果蝇属 |The word "drosophilae" is the plural form of "drosophila," referring to a genus of small flies in the family Drosophilidae.  These flies are often used in genetic research due to their short life cycle, ease of breeding, and relatively simple genome.  The genus includes the well-known fruit fly, *Drosophila melanogaster*.|Example:  Scientists conducted experiments on various drosophilae species to study genetic mutations.  科学家们对不同种类的果蝇进行了实验以研究基因突变。|近义词: fruit flies (informal)|反义词: N/A
