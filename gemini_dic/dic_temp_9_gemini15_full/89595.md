词源:
The word "hoodlum" is of uncertain origin, with several theories proposed.  One popular theory links it to "hood," referring to a person's head or a neighborhood, and "lum," a slang term possibly derived from "lumper," meaning a clumsy or awkward person.  The combination suggests a clumsy or rough person from a particular neighborhood, fitting the modern definition.  Another theory connects it to a specific person or group's name, but lacks definitive proof.  Its usage solidified in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, especially in association with gang activity.
