词源:

The word "nice-looking" is a compound adjective formed from "nice" and "looking."  "Nice," originally meaning "foolish" or "ignorant,"  evolved through Old French "nice" (from Latin "nescius," meaning "ignorant") to its modern meaning of "pleasant" or "agreeable."  "Looking," derived from the verb "look," describes the appearance of something.  The combination creates a descriptive adjective emphasizing the pleasantness of someone's or something's appearance.
