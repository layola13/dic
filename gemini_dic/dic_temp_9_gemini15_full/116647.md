WORD ORIGIN->
The adverb "matter-of-factly" is derived from the adjective "matter-of-fact," which itself combines "matter" (meaning "fact" or "substance") and "of fact" (emphasizing the factual nature). The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective into an adverb, indicating the manner or way in which something is done.
