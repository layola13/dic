/ˌoʊvərˈhoʊmlinəsiz/ | n. | 过分家常；过度舒适；过于居家 | The word "overhomelinesses" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a newly coined word, formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" to "overhomeliness," which itself is not a common word.  It attempts to convey the plural of a state or condition of being excessively homely or comfortable to the point of being undesirable.  The word suggests an excess of domesticity, coziness, or familiarity, potentially to a degree that is overwhelming or unpleasant.  There are no direct synonyms or antonyms as it's not a standard word.  Because it's not a standard word, providing example sentences, grammatical usage, or phrases is not possible in a meaningful way.  The word needs to be understood within the context in which it was created.
