The word "renning" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "running," "renouncing," or a similar word?

2. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (a name of a person, place, or thing) specific to a certain context.  More information is needed to understand its meaning.

3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word or slang term not yet widely recognized.

4. **It's a word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language, and its meaning would depend on the language of origin.

Without more context or a corrected spelling, a detailed analysis as requested is impossible.  Please provide more information so I can assist you.
