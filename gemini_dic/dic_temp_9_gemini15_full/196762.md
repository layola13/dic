词源:
The word "sexism" is a relatively modern coinage, emerging in the mid-20th century.  It combines "sex" (referring to the biological differences between male and female) with the suffix "-ism," which typically indicates a belief system, ideology, or practice.  The suffix "-ism" denotes a doctrine, system, or way of thinking. Thus, sexism describes a system of beliefs and practices that privileges one sex over another.
