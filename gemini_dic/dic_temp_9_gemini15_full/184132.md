resister:/rɪˈzɪstər/ | n. |电阻器，抵抗者 |A resister is a component in an electrical circuit that opposes the flow of current.  It can also refer to a person who resists or opposes something. |例句：The circuit needs a 100-ohm resister.  电路需要一个100欧姆的电阻器。 He was a resister of the regime. 他是该政权的抵抗者。|近义词： resistor (for electrical component), opponent, opponent, rebel |反义词：conductor (for electrical component), supporter, collaborator


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The resister limits the current flow. = 电阻器限制电流流动。
He resists change. = 他抵制改变。


一般过去时:
The old resister burned out. = 旧电阻器烧坏了。
They resisted the invaders. = 他们抵抗侵略者。


现在完成时:
The engineer has installed a new resister. = 工程师安装了一个新的电阻器。
She has resisted all temptations. = 她抵制住了所有的诱惑。


过去完成时:
The circuit malfunctioned because the resister had failed. = 电路故障是因为电阻器坏了。
They had resisted for months before surrendering. = 他们抵抗了几个月才投降。


将来时:
We will install a higher-wattage resister. = 我们将安装一个更高瓦数的电阻器。
He will resist pressure to resign. = 他将抵制辞职的压力。


虚拟语气:
If the resister were stronger, the circuit would work better. = 如果电阻器更强，电路就会工作得更好。
If he had resisted more strongly, the outcome might have been different. = 如果他抵抗得更强烈，结果可能会有所不同。


被动语态:
The current is resisted by the resister. = 电流被电阻器阻碍。
The new policy was resisted by many. = 许多人抵制这项新政策。


疑问句:
What type of resister is needed? = 需要什么类型的电阻器？
Who is resisting the reforms? = 谁在抵制改革？


否定句:
The circuit doesn't have enough resistance. = 电路没有足够的电阻。
He didn't resist arrest. = 他没有反抗逮捕。


PHRASE->
variable resister = 可变电阻器
power resister = 功率电阻器
high-value resister = 高值电阻器
current-limiting resister = 限流电阻器
precision resister = 精密电阻器
