The word "praxonos" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis including pronunciation, word class, meaning, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, and grammatical examples as requested.  It's possible that:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  A slight alteration might reveal a known word.
* **It's a neologism:** It might be a newly coined word, a technical term, or jargon specific to a particular field.  If you can provide the context where you encountered this word, it might help determine its meaning.
* **It's a word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language that hasn't been widely adopted into English.  Knowing the language of origin would be helpful.

Please provide more information about the word's origin or context so I can assist you further.
