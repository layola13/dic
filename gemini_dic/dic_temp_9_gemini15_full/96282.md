The word "indiest" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a non-standard variation.  There's no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It might be intended as a superlative form of "indie" (independent), but this isn't grammatically correct in standard English.  To provide an analysis, we'll need to assume it's meant to be a comparative or superlative form of "indie."


If "indiest" is intended to mean "most independent," we can analyze it as follows, based on the word "indie":


/ˈɪndi/ | adj. | 独立的，另类的 | Independent, especially in music, film, or art; not affiliated with a major label or studio.  It often implies a DIY or underground aesthetic. | Example:  "The band released their indiest album yet, showcasing their unique sound."  | 近义词: independent, alternative, underground | 反义词: mainstream, commercial
