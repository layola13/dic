Etymology:

The word "chairman" is a compound word.  It combines "chair" and "man."

* **Chair:**  From Old French *chaiere*, ultimately from Latin *cathedra*, meaning "seat," especially a seat of authority or a bishop's throne.  This reflects the chairman's position of authority in a meeting or organization – they literally "sit in the chair" of leadership.

* **Man:** From Old English *mann*, meaning "human being," "person."  In this context, it simply indicates the person holding the chair of authority.
