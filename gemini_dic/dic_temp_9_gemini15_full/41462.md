cornification:/ˌkɔːrnɪfɪˈkeɪʃən/| n. |角质化，角化 |The process by which cells become hard and keratinized.  This process is crucial for the formation of the skin's outer layer (stratum corneum) and provides a protective barrier against the environment.  |Example:  The cornification of the epidermis protects against dehydration and infection. 角质层角质化保护皮肤免受脱水和感染。|近义词：keratinization |反义词：desquamation (脱屑), softening

If the cornification process were disrupted, the skin would be vulnerable. = 如果角质化过程被打扰，皮肤就会变得脆弱。
It is essential that the cornification process proceeds normally for healthy skin. = 角质化过程正常进行对健康皮肤至关重要。


被动语态:
Cornification is influenced by various factors, including genetics and environment. = 角质化受多种因素影响，包括遗传和环境。
The rate of cornification can be altered by certain medications. = 某些药物可以改变角质化的速度。


疑问句:
