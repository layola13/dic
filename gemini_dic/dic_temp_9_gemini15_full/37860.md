The word "compien" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Please double-check the spelling.
2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name (place, person, etc.) not found in general dictionaries.  More context is needed.
3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word, a term specific to a certain community, or slang not yet widely recognized.  Again, more context is necessary.
4. **It's from another language:**  It might be a word from a different language. If you can provide the language of origin, I can attempt a translation and explanation.


To provide the requested analysis, I need the correct spelling or more information about the context in which you encountered this word.
