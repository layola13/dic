USAGE->

His predisagreeing attitude made collaboration difficult. = 他事先反对的态度使合作变得困难。


PHRASE->

This word is not typically used in phrases in the same way as "what".  Phrases would involve the use of the word in a sentence, not as a standalone phrase.  For example:

A predisagreeing atmosphere: 一种事先持反对意见的氛围
Predisagreeing comments: 事先反对的评论
Showing predisagreement: 表现出事先反对
Having a predisagreeing stance: 采取事先反对的立场


词源:

The word "predisagreeing" is formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") with the verb "disagree" (-ing is the present participle form).  Therefore, it literally means "disagreeing beforehand".
