词源：

The word "self-monitoring" is a compound word.  "Self" is an Old English word meaning "one's own," and "monitoring" comes from the verb "to monitor," which has its roots in the Latin word "monēre," meaning "to warn" or "to remind."  Therefore, "self-monitoring" literally means "the act of one's own warning or reminding oneself." The evolution to its current meaning reflects the shift in the meaning of "monitor" to encompass observation and regulation.
