The word "refries" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  It could be a misspelling of another word.  Could you please double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant "refries" as a plural of "refry"?  If so, I can provide an analysis of "refry".
* **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, a slang term, or specific to a certain dialect or community. More context is needed.
* **It's a proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (name of a person, place, or thing), in which case a definition would depend on its specific context.


Please provide more information or context so I can help you.  If you meant "refry," I will happily provide the analysis as requested in the format you provided.
