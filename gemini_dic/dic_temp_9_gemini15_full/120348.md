minimelodramas:/ˌmɪniˈmɛləˌdrɑːməz/| n.|小型戏剧，小情小调|Mini-melodrama refers to small-scale or insignificant melodramatic events or situations. It implies a level of drama that is disproportionate to the actual importance of the event, often characterized by exaggeration, sentimentality, and emotional intensity.  The "mini" prefix diminishes the scale of the melodrama, suggesting it's less grand or significant than a full-blown melodrama.  |例句：Her anxieties over a misplaced earring were nothing more than minimelodramas.  她的耳环丢了，为此焦虑不安，不过是小题大做罢了。
The office spat over the stapler was a minimelodramas compared to the company's financial troubles. 办公室里为订书机发生的争执，与公司面临的财务困境相比，简直是小巫见大巫。|近义词：petty dramas, minor crises, trivial incidents, insignificant troubles |反义词：major tragedies, significant events, grand dramas

词源:
The word "minimelodramas" is a compound word.  "Mini" is a prefix meaning "small" or "little," derived from the Latin word "minimus" (the superlative of "parvus," meaning "small"). "Melodrama" comes from the Greek words "melos" (melody) and "drama" (action).  Originally, melodramas were plays that featured musical accompaniment to heighten the emotional impact of the scenes.  Over time, "melodrama" came to describe any exaggerated or sensationalized dramatic situation.  Therefore, "minimelodramas" describes smaller, less significant instances of this exaggerated dramatic style.
