词源:

The word "indistinct" comes from the Old French "indistinct," meaning "not distinct," which in turn comes from the Latin "indistinctus," a combination of the prefix "in-" (not) and "distinctus" (separated, distinguished).  The suffix "-ible" makes it an adjective meaning "capable of being."  Therefore, "indistinctible" means "not capable of being distinguished."
