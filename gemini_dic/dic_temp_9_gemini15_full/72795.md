词源:
The word "foist" comes from the Middle English word "foisten," which meant "to thrust" or "to push."  The origin is ultimately uncertain, but some etymologists suggest a possible connection to Old French words related to pushing or thrusting.  The modern meaning evolved from the sense of pushing something unwelcome onto someone else.
