词源:

The word "politicized" is derived from the noun "politics" and the suffix "-ized," which indicates the process of making something into something else.  "Politics" itself originates from the Greek word "politikos," meaning "of, for, or relating to citizens."  The "-ized" suffix is of Greek origin as well, related to the verb "izein," meaning "to cause to be." Therefore, politicized essentially means "to make political."
