USAGE->
This word is extremely rare and almost never used.  Therefore, providing example sentences across various grammatical tenses is impractical and would be artificial.  The word itself is a neologism (newly coined word) and its usage would be highly contextual and dependent on the specific scientific or academic field where it might appear.


PHRASE->
There are no established phrases using "nonpredatorilyness".  Its rarity precludes the development of common collocations.
