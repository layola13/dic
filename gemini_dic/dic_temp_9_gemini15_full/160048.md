polytope:/ˈpɒliˌtoʊp/ /ˈpɑːliˌtoʊp/| n. |多胞体|A polytope is a geometric object with flat sides.  In higher dimensions, it generalizes the notion of a polygon (in two dimensions) and a polyhedron (in three dimensions).  It is a bounded region of space defined by a set of linear inequalities. |Example: A cube is a three-dimensional polytope, while a square is a two-dimensional polytope.  The study of polytopes is a significant area in geometry and combinatorics. |近义词：polyhedron (in 3D), polygon (in 2D) |反义词：None (no direct antonym)
