词源:

The word "overgoverning" is a compound word formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the noun "governing" (relating to the act of governing or controlling).  "Governing" itself comes from the verb "govern," which traces back to Old French "governer" and ultimately to Latin "gubernāre" (to steer, to direct).
