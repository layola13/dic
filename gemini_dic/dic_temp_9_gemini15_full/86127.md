词源:
The word "heartener" is derived from the verb "to hearten," meaning "to encourage," "to give heart to," or "to strengthen the spirits of."  The suffix "-er" forms a noun, indicating something that performs the action of the verb.  Ultimately, it connects to the Old English word "heorte," meaning "heart," highlighting the emotional impact of encouragement.
