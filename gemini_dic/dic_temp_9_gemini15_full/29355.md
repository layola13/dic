词源:  The word "castor" ultimately derives from the Latin word *castor*, meaning "beaver."  This is because beaver fur was historically used to make hats, and the small wheels used on furniture were sometimes called "castor wheels" due to their resemblance to the shape of a beaver's foot, or perhaps because the wood used to make the wheels was associated with the beaver's habitat.  The association with the castor bean plant is later and likely due to a phonetic similarity.
