nonantigenic: /ˌnɒnˌæntiˈdʒɛnɪk/ | adj. |非抗原性的| Not capable of stimulating an immune response.  Substances that are nonantigenic do not trigger the production of antibodies or other immune responses in the body.  This is often because they are too small, too simple, or chemically inert to be recognized as foreign by the immune system. |

例句：

Many synthetic polymers are nonantigenic and thus suitable for use in biomedical implants.  许多合成聚合物是非抗原性的，因此适合用于生物医学植入物。

The drug was designed to be nonantigenic to minimize adverse reactions. 该药物的设计目的是非抗原性的，以最大限度地减少不良反应。
