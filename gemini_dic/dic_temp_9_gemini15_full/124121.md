词源:  The word "mortgage" comes from Old French *mort gage*, literally meaning "dead pledge".  This reflects the fact that the property serves as collateral, and if the loan isn't repaid, the ownership is essentially "dead" to the borrower.  The Old French term itself derives from the Old Norman French *mort gage*, combining the words "mort" (dead) and "gage" (pledge).
