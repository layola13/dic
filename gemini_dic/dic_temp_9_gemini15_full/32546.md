The word "chippangu" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries or etymological resources.  It's likely a misspelling, a word from a specific dialect or jargon, or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, further context is needed, such as:

* **Where did you encounter this word?** (e.g., a book, website, conversation)
* **What was the context?**  Understanding the surrounding words and sentences will help determine the intended meaning.

Without this information, I can only speculate.  It *might* be a misspelling of a similar-sounding word, but without more context, I cannot offer a valid analysis.
