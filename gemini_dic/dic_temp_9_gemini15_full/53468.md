词源:
The word "disarmer" comes from the verb "disarm," which is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "to remove or undo") and the noun "arm" (meaning "weapon").  Therefore, "disarm" literally means "to remove weapons." The noun "disarmer" then naturally follows as a person or thing that performs this action.
