词源:
From French macabre, from Medieval Latin machab(a)eus, from Hebrew Maḥabhē, from the name of the Maccabees (a family of Jewish patriots who lived in the 2nd century BCE),  associated with a medieval French danse macabre ("dance of death") which depicted skeletons dancing with people of all social classes, signifying the universality of death.  The association with death and the grotesque evolved from this imagery.
