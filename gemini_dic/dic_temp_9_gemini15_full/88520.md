"hit's" is a contraction of "hit is" or (less commonly) "hit has," which are verb phrases, not single words.  Therefore, applying the requested format directly to "hit's" is inappropriate.  To provide a helpful response, we need to analyze "hit" and its use in the contracted form "hit's" separately.
