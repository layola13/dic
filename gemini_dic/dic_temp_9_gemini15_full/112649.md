词源:
The word "lowbred" is a compound word.  "Low" signifies a low social rank or position, while "bred" refers to upbringing and social background.  Therefore, "lowbred" literally means "of low breeding" or "poorly bred."  The word's roots trace back to Old English, with "low" having Germanic origins and "bred" deriving from the Old English "brēdan," meaning "to bring up," "to nourish," or "to rear."
