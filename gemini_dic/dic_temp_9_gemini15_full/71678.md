词源:  The word "flaundrish" is derived from the obsolete adjective "flaundry," meaning "showy" or "ostentatious."  This, in turn, likely originates from the Middle Dutch word "vlaenderen," referring to Flanders, a region in Belgium known for its rich and often elaborate textiles and artistic styles. The implication is that the style associated with Flanders was considered overly ornate or flamboyant by some.  The word fell out of common usage, but survives in some older texts.
