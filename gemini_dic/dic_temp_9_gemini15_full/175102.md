rads:/rædz/| n.|弧度|A radian is a unit of angle, equal to the angle at the center of a circle subtended by an arc equal in length to the radius of the circle.  It's a fundamental unit in mathematics and physics, particularly in calculus and trigonometry.  |Example: The angle is approximately 1.57 rads.  这个角度大约是1.57弧度。|近义词: degree (though a different unit)|反义词:无|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The angle measures 2 rads. = 这个角度测量为2弧度。
How many rads are in a circle? = 一个圆有多少弧度？


一般过去时:
The wheel rotated 10 rads. = 轮子旋转了10弧度。
We calculated the angle in rads. = 我们用弧度计算了角度。


现在完成时:
The pendulum has swung through many rads. = 钟摆已经摆动了很多弧度。
Scientists have measured the angle in rads. = 科学家们已经用弧度测量了这个角度。


过去完成时:
The car had turned through several rads before stopping. = 汽车在停下之前已经转过了好几个弧度。
They had already converted the degrees to rads. = 他们已经将角度转换为弧度了。


将来时:
The satellite will rotate 360 rads. = 卫星将旋转360弧度。
We will measure the angle in rads next. = 我们接下来将用弧度测量这个角度。


虚拟语气:
If the angle were 90 degrees, it would be π/2 rads. = 如果角度是90度，那么它将是π/2弧度。
I wish I had known the angle was measured in rads. = 我希望我知道角度是用弧度测量的。


被动语态:
The angle was measured in rads. = 这个角度是用弧度测量的。
The calculations are being performed in rads. = 计算正在用弧度进行。


疑问句:
How many rads is that? = 那是多少弧度？
What is the angle in rads? = 这个角度是多少弧度？


否定句:
The angle is not expressed in rads. = 这个角度不是用弧度表示的。
The calculations did not use rads. = 计算没有使用弧度。


PHRASE->
rads per second (rad/s) = 弧度每秒
angular velocity in rads = 角速度（弧度）
convert degrees to rads = 将度数转换为弧度
radians per second squared (rad/s²) = 弧度每二次方秒
measuring angles in rads = 用弧度测量角度
