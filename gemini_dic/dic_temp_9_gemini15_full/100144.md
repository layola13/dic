词源:

The word "interracial" is a combination of the prefix "inter-" (meaning "between" or "among") and the word "racial" (relating to race).  "Racial" derives from "race," ultimately from the Old French word "race," meaning "kind," "breed," or "lineage."  The modern understanding of "race" as a social and biological construct is a later development.
