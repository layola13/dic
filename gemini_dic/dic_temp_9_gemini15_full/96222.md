词源:
The word "Indian" originates from a historical misunderstanding.  Christopher Columbus mistakenly believed he had reached the East Indies (modern-day Indonesia) when he landed in the Americas.  Thus, he called the indigenous peoples "Indians," a misnomer that persists to this day.  The term's use for people from India derives from the British colonial period.
