gentilitious:/ˌdʒɛn.tɪˈlɪʃəs/| adj.|表示种族的；表示氏族的；表示家族的| Relating to a gentile; of or relating to the gentiles.  The term often implies a distinction from a dominant or ruling group, often in a historical or cultural context.  It may carry connotations of politeness or courtesy, but its primary focus is on group affiliation. |例句：The gentilitious name "Smith" doesn't reveal much about its bearer's ancestry. 史密斯这个姓氏并不能揭示其持有人的祖先信息。


The use of "gentilitious" is quite specialized and less frequently used than other words conveying similar meanings.  It doesn't have commonly used verb, noun, or adverb forms.  Therefore, grammatical examples in various tenses are not applicable in the same way as with a common verb like "to be".


近义词：ethnic, tribal, racial (in some contexts), clannish


反义词：This word doesn't have a direct antonym, as its meaning is descriptive rather than evaluative.  The opposite concept would be "non-gentilitious," but this is rarely used.  Words like "universal" or "individual" could be considered opposite in the sense of focusing on the individual rather than group affiliation.
