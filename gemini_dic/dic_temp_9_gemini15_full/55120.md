词源:
disruptive comes from the verb "disrupt," which is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away" or "not") and the verb "rupt" (meaning "to break").  The original Latin root is "rumpere" meaning "to break".  Therefore, "disrupt" literally means "to break apart" or "to interrupt."  The adjective "disruptive" then follows naturally from this meaning.
