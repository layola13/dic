词源:
The word "remoulade" comes from the French word  "remouler," meaning "to grind" or "to remould," referring to the process of finely grinding ingredients for the sauce.  The sauce itself likely originated in the region of  Provence, France, and eventually spread to other areas and cuisines, particularly in Louisiana, USA, where it is frequently used in Cajun and Creole cooking.
