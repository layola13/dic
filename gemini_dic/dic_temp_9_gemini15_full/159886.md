polymorph:/ˈpɒliˌmɔːrf/ /ˈpɑːliˌmɔːrf/| n. adj.|多形体；多晶型；多态性|A polymorph is a substance that exists in more than one crystalline form.  It refers to the ability of a substance to exist in two or more different forms, each with a distinct crystal structure. This can affect properties like density, melting point, and solubility. In computer science, it refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms.|例句：Diamond and graphite are polymorphs of carbon.  金刚石和石墨是碳的多晶型体。|The mineral calcite exhibits polymorphism. 方解石矿物表现出多晶型现象。|近义词： allotrope, variant|反义词：monomorph
