WORD ORIGIN->

Gracefulness derives from the adjective "graceful," which in turn comes from the Old French word "gracieux," meaning "pleasing, grateful."  The ultimate origin is the Latin word "gratia," meaning "grace, favor, thanks."  The "-fulness" suffix adds the meaning of "full of" or "characterized by."
