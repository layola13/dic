词源:
The word "debted" comes from the Old French word "debet," which means "debt."  The suffix "-ed" transforms the noun "debt" into an adjective describing a state of being in debt or owing something.  The sense of gratitude developed later, reflecting the obligation felt towards someone who has extended a kindness or favor.
