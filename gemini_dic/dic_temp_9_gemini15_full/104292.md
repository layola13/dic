词源:

The word "justifiably" derives from the adjective "justifiable," which in turn comes from the verb "justify."  "Justify" ultimately originates from the Old French word "justifier,"  which itself is derived from the Latin word "iustificare," a combination of "ius" (meaning "law," "right," or "justice") and "facere" (meaning "to make" or "to do").  Therefore, "justifiably" traces its roots back to the concept of making something right or just.
