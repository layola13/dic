词源:

The word "colloquialism" comes from the Late Latin word *colloquialis*, which is derived from the verb *colloqui*, meaning "to converse" or "to speak together."  The prefix *col-* means "together," and *loqui* means "to speak."  Therefore, the word's roots point directly to its meaning as words or phrases used in everyday conversation.
