词源:The term "prime time" originates from the broadcasting industry. "Prime" means "of first importance or quality," and "time" refers to a specific period.  The combination suggests the most valuable or important time slot for broadcasting, due to the largest viewership.  The usage evolved from its literal meaning to encompass other contexts where a period is considered optimal.
