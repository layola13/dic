The word "hypergeneticalness's" is not a recognized word in standard English.  It appears to be a neologism, or newly coined word, formed by incorrectly combining and adding suffixes to existing words. Let's break down the attempted construction:


* **hypergenetical:** This seems to be an attempt to combine "hyper-" (meaning "excessive" or "beyond") with "genetical" (relating to genetics).  However, "genetical" itself is less common than "genetic."  A proper word would be "hypergenetic," but even this is not a widely used term.  It might be used in a very specialized scientific context to describe something excessively related to genetics or gene expression.

* **hypergeneticalness:** Adding "-ness" creates a noun form, suggesting a state or quality of being hypergenetical. However, due to the dubious base word, this is nonsensical in standard English.

* **hypergeneticalness's:**  The possessive apostrophe-s ("'s") is grammatically correct if applied to a proper noun, but makes no sense here because "hypergeneticalness" is not a proper noun, and adding a possessive suffix further obscures the meaning.


Therefore, there is no standard pronunciation, definition, usage, synonyms, or antonyms for "hypergeneticalness's."  If encountered, it should be considered a misspelling or an invented term within a specific, highly specialized, and likely informal context.  The writer likely intended to use a different, correctly spelled and grammatically correct word to convey their intended meaning.
