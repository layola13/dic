overbumptiousnesses:/ˌoʊvərˈbʌmpʃəsˌnɛsɪz/| n. |傲慢自大的行为；自以为是的表现 |The word "overbumptiousnesses" is extremely rare and not found in standard dictionaries.  It's a nonce word, likely formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" (pluralizing a quality) to "overbumptious," which itself is an intensifying and somewhat informal variant of "bumptious."  "Bumptious" means self-assertive or obtrusive in a loud or aggressive way. Therefore, "overbumptiousnesses" refers to multiple instances of excessively assertive, presumptuous, and rude behavior. |例句：His overbumptiousnesses at the meeting alienated many of his colleagues.  他会议上的傲慢自大的行为疏远了许多同事。  |近义词：instances of arrogance, displays of presumption, acts of impertinence, exhibitions of conceit |反义词：humility, modesty, deference, respect |名词
