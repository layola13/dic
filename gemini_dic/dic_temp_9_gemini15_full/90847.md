词源:  The word "hungover" is a compound word. "Hung" is the past participle of the verb "hang,"  and "over" indicates a lingering effect.  The original meaning related to the feeling of being weighed down or burdened, similar to the feeling of being "hung up" on something. Over time, it became specifically associated with the after-effects of alcohol consumption.
