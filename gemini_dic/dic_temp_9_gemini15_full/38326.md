词源:
The word "conceited" comes from the Old French word "conceit," meaning "concept, thought, opinion," which in turn derives from the Latin word "concipere," meaning "to conceive, to take in."  Over time, the meaning shifted to emphasize an overly high opinion of oneself.

用法说明:

conceited 通常作形容词使用，修饰人或其行为。它强调的是一种过高的自我评价，通常伴随着自夸和对他人成就的轻视。  与vain的区别在于，vain更注重外在的炫耀和对他人赞美的渴望，而conceited更注重内在的自我感觉良好以及由此产生的优越感。

1.  He is so conceited that he believes everyone envies him. 他如此自负，认为每个人都嫉妒他。
