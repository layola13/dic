词源:

The word "infrastructures" is the plural form of "infrastructure."  "Infrastructure" itself is a relatively modern word, arising from the combination of the Latin prefix "infra-" (meaning "below," "beneath," or "under") and the Latin word "structura" (meaning "construction" or "structure").  Thus, "infrastructure" literally means "the underlying structure." Its usage to refer to fundamental systems emerged in the 19th century, gaining prominence in the 20th.
