词源:
The word "overreactivity" is a compound word.  "Over" is a prefix meaning "too much" or "excessive," and "reactivity" is derived from "reactive" (adj.) and ultimately from the verb "react," meaning "to act in response to something."  Therefore, "overreactivity" literally means "excessive reaction."  The root is found in the Latin "re-" (back, again) + "agere" (to do, to act).
