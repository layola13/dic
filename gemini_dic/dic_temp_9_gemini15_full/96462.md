词源:

The word "individualistic" is derived from the word "individual," which comes from the Late Latin word *individuus*, meaning "indivisible, undivided, single."  The suffix "-istic" is added to create an adjective meaning "characteristic of or relating to an individual."  The concept of individualism itself emerged in the Western world during the Renaissance and Enlightenment, emphasizing the inherent worth and autonomy of the individual.
