The word "sappare" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a different word?  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to suggest a possible correct spelling.

2. **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word, a word specific to a particular community or field, or slang.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **It's a word from another language:** It could be a word borrowed from another language and not yet widely adopted into English.


Without more information, I cannot provide a detailed analysis according to the requested format.  Please provide the context in which you saw "sappare."
