词源:  The word "referring" is the present participle of the verb "refer," which comes from the Latin word "referre," meaning "to carry back," "to report," or "to relate."  The Latin word is composed of "re-" (back) and "ferre" (to carry).  Over time, its meaning evolved to encompass the sense of directing attention to something or someone.
