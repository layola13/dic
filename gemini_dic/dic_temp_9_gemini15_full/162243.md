The word "pre-Syrians" does not exist as a standard English word.  There is no entry in major dictionaries.  It's likely a newly coined term or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need to understand the intended meaning.  Is it referring to:

* **People who lived in Syria before a specific historical event?**  If so, a more accurate term would be needed, specifying the event (e.g., "pre-Ottoman Syrians," "pre-Roman Syrians").

* **A specific ethnic group predating modern Syrians?** This would require historical and archaeological context.

* **A misspelling of another term?**  Please double-check the spelling.

Once the intended meaning is clarified, a proper analysis can be provided.
