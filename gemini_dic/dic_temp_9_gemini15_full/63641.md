The word "eor" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It's possible:

* **It's a misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **It's a very obscure word:**  It might be a technical term, a word from a dialect, or an archaic word.  If you can provide context (where you encountered this word), it would be helpful.
* **It's a newly coined word or abbreviation:**  It's possible the word is very recent and hasn't yet made it into dictionaries.

Please provide more information so I can assist you properly.
