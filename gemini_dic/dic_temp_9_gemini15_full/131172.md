nonbreeder:/ˈnɒnˈbriːdər/ | n. |不繁殖者，未繁殖者 |A nonbreeder is an animal or plant that does not breed or reproduce.  This term is often used in biology and ecology to describe individuals within a population that do not participate in reproduction.  The reasons for nonbreeding can be varied, including age, health, lack of suitable mates, or environmental factors. | Example:  The study focused on the proportion of nonbreeders within the penguin colony. 这项研究侧重于企鹅群体中不繁殖者的比例。 The high percentage of nonbreeders suggests a problem within the habitat. 高比例的不繁殖者表明栖息地存在问题。 |近义词：sterile, infertile  |反义词：breeder

This species has a high percentage of nonbreeders in its population. = 这种物种在其种群中具有很高比例的不繁殖者。


一般过去时:
Researchers observed the behavior of the nonbreeders during the breeding season. = 研究人员观察了繁殖季节期间不繁殖者的行为。
Last year, a significant number of nonbreeders were recorded in the study area. = 去年，在研究区域记录到大量的不繁殖者。


现在完成时:
Scientists have documented a decline in the number of nonbreeders over the past decade. = 科学家们已经记录了在过去十年中不繁殖者数量的下降。
We have observed that environmental stress can lead to an increase in nonbreeders. = 我们观察到环境压力会导致不繁殖者数量增加。


过去完成时:
Before the habitat restoration, the population had a higher proportion of nonbreeders. = 在栖息地恢复之前，种群中不繁殖者的比例更高。
The researchers had already identified several key factors influencing nonbreeding behavior before the study began. = 在研究开始之前，研究人员已经确定了几个影响不繁殖行为的关键因素。


将来时:

We predict that climate change will impact the breeding success and therefore the number of nonbreeders. = 我们预测气候变化将影响繁殖成功率，从而影响不繁殖者的数量。


虚拟语气:
If there were more resources available, there would be fewer nonbreeders. = 如果有更多资源可用，不繁殖者就会更少。

被动语态:
The nonbreeders were carefully monitored throughout the study. = 在整个研究过程中，对不繁殖者进行了仔细监测。
Several factors are believed to contribute to the high number of nonbreeders observed.  = 人们认为有几个因素导致了观察到的高数量的不繁殖者。


疑问句:
Are the nonbreeders exhibiting any specific behavioral patterns? = 不繁殖者是否表现出任何特定的行为模式？
Why are so many nonbreeders present in this particular population? = 为什么在这个特定种群中存在如此多的不繁殖者？


否定句:
The study did not find any significant differences between breeders and nonbreeders. = 该研究没有发现繁殖者和不繁殖者之间有任何显著差异。
The researchers were not able to identify all the reasons for nonbreeding in the population. = 研究人员无法识别该种群中不繁殖的所有原因。
