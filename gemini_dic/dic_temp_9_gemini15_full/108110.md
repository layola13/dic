The word "latia" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis with pronunciation, parts of speech, meaning, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in your format.  There is no entry for "latia" in major English dictionaries.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or looking word?
* **A proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (like a place name or person's name) not found in general dictionaries.  More context is needed.
* **A neologism or technical term:**  It might be a newly coined word or a term used within a specific field (like a scientific or technical discipline).  If so, providing that context would be helpful.
* **A word from another language:**  It could be a word borrowed from another language.  Specifying the language would assist in finding its meaning.


Please provide more information or context so I can help you.
