词源:

The word "earmark" originally referred to a mark made on an animal's ear to identify its owner.  This practice dates back centuries.  The modern usage, referring to a designated portion of a budget, developed later, drawing an analogy from the clear identification of ownership.  The "ear" part refers to the animal's ear, and "mark" denotes the identifying sign.
