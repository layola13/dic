enclitical:/ɛnˈklɪtɪkəl/| adj.| 附着语的；倚声词的 | An enclitic is a word that is phonetically attached to the preceding word.  It is typically a short word, often a pronoun or auxiliary verb, that loses its stress and is pronounced as part of the preceding word.  This contrasts with proclitics, which attach to the following word. | Example:  "He's" is an enclitic, where "is" is attached to "He" and loses its independent stress.  The pronunciation is closer to  /hiːz/ rather than /hiː ɪz/. | 近义词：clitic (a broader term encompassing both enclitics and proclitics) | 反义词：proclitic


Etymology:  The word "enclitic" comes from the Greek  ἐγκλιτικός (enklītikós), which is derived from  ἐγκλίνω (enklínō), meaning "I incline," "I lean upon," or "I bend."  This reflects the grammatical behavior of enclitics, which "lean upon" or attach themselves to the preceding word.


Usage:

Enclitics are a feature of morphology and phonology, particularly in languages with relatively free word order.  They don't have a grammatical function like tenses or moods, but rather describe a phonetic phenomenon.  Their meaning is unchanged, but their pronunciation is altered by their attachment.  Examples are frequently found in English contractions like "can't," "won't," "I'm," "you're," "he's," "she's," "it's," and "they're".  These are all examples of enclitics where the auxiliary verb is attached to the preceding pronoun.  Other languages have far more extensive uses of enclitics.


Examples in English:

* He's going home. (He is going home)
* She'll be there soon. (She will be there soon)


More examples of enclitics across languages (though a complete list is impossible due to the vast number of languages and their variations):

* Many languages utilize enclitic pronouns.  For example, in some Slavic languages, pronouns can attach to verbs.
* Certain particles or grammatical markers in many languages behave as enclitics.



Note:  The concept of enclitics is primarily relevant to the study of linguistics and phonetics; it is not a word that is frequently used in everyday conversation.  Its application is in analyzing the structure and sound changes of words within sentences.
