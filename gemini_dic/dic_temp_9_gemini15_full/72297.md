词源:

The word "flounder" in this context ultimately derives from the Old English word *flūndrian*, meaning "to stumble, to falter".  This is connected to the Old Norse *flúðra*, with a similar meaning.  The modern meaning as a clumsy person or one who struggles is a later development of this original sense of stumbling or wavering.
