词源:
The word "digestor" comes from the verb "digest," meaning to break down food or other substances into simpler forms.  The suffix "-or" is an agent suffix, indicating a person or thing that performs the action.  The word's roots trace back to the Latin verb "digerere," meaning "to distribute, arrange, carry off."  The connection to digestion comes from the sense of separating and rearranging components of food.
