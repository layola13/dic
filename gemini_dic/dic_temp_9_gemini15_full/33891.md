There is no such word in common dictionaries and corpora, suggesting it is not a frequently used or standard English word.  It's likely formed by adding "-ness" to "circumstantial,"  creating a noun form emphasizing the quality or state of being circumstantial.

词源：

* **circumstantial:**  derived from  "circumstance" (n.) + "-al" (adj. suffix).
* **circumstance:** from Old French *circonstance*, from Latin *circumstantia*, from *circumstare* "to stand around," from *circum* "around" + *stare* "to stand."

用法说明：

While not a standard word, its meaning can be inferred from its constituent parts.  It describes the state or quality of being dependent on circumstances, being contingent, or having a strong contextual element.  It implies a lack of certainty or predictability due to reliance on specific situations or conditions.
