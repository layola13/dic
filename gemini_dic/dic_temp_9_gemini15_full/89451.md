词源:
The word "honest" comes from the Old English word "honeste," meaning "honor," "good repute," or "decorum."  This in turn derives from the Latin word "honestus," which had a similar range of meanings, including "honorable," "respectable," and "worthy."  The evolution reflects a shift in emphasis from social standing to moral integrity.
