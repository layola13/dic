词源：
The term "cold sore" is a descriptive name, referring to the small sores that appear on the lips and the fact that they are sometimes associated with colds or other illnesses, although this is not necessarily the direct cause. The actual causative agent is the herpes simplex virus (HSV).  The term "fever blister" is also used, again reflecting the association with illness, even though it's not caused by a fever.
