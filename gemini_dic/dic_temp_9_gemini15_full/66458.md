词源:

The word "exemption" comes from the Latin word "exemptio," which means "a taking out," "a freeing," or "an exception."  The prefix "ex-" means "out" or "from," and the verb "emere" means "to take" or "to buy."  Therefore, "exemptio" literally means "a taking out from" or "a freeing from."  This etymological root clearly shows the core meaning of the word.
