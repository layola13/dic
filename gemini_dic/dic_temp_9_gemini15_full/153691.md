The word "peopler" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  It might be:

1. **A neologism or nonce word:**  A newly coined word used in a specific context or created for a particular purpose.  Without context, its meaning is undefined.

2. **A misspelling:** It might be a misspelling of another word, but without more information, it's impossible to determine what that word might be.

3. **A slang or dialect term:** It could be a slang term used within a particular community or region, but its meaning would need to be established through that community's usage.


Therefore, a complete analysis as requested in the format is impossible without further context or clarification on the intended word.
