The term describes something that causes or is related to the widening or enlarging of something, often a body part or opening. |例句：The dilatational waves caused by the earthquake were felt across the region. 地震引起的膨胀波在该地区被感受到。

The dilatational effects of the medication were immediately apparent.  药物的扩张作用立即显现。|近义词：expansive, enlarging, expanding |反义词：constrictive, contracting, compressing |词性：形容词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The dilatational force is significant. = 膨胀力很大。
This medicine has a dilatational effect. = 这药有扩张作用。


一般过去时:
The dilatational stress was relieved. = 膨胀应力得到了缓解。
The balloon underwent significant dilatational change. = 气球经历了显著的膨胀变化。


现在完成时:
The artery has undergone dilatational changes. = 动脉已经发生了扩张变化。
Significant dilatational damage has occurred. = 已经发生了严重的膨胀损伤。


过去完成时:
The pipe had already experienced dilatational failure. = 管道已经发生了膨胀性破坏。
Before the incident, the vessel had shown no sign of dilatational weakness. = 事故发生前，血管没有显示出膨胀性弱点。


将来时:
The material will experience dilatational strain under heat. = 该材料在受热时会发生膨胀应变。
The expansion will cause dilatational damage to the structure. = 膨胀会对结构造成膨胀性损坏。


虚拟语气:
If the pressure increased, dilatational failure would occur. = 如果压力增加，就会发生膨胀性破坏。
If the temperature were higher, the dilatational effect would be greater. = 如果温度更高，膨胀效果会更大。


被动语态:
The artery was dilated by the medication. = 动脉被药物扩张了。
The structure was damaged by dilatational forces. = 结构被膨胀力破坏了。


疑问句:
Is the dilatational effect temporary or permanent? = 膨胀效果是暂时的还是永久的？
Are there any signs of dilatational weakness in the material? = 材料是否有膨胀性弱点的迹象？


否定句:
The material did not exhibit any significant dilatational properties. = 该材料没有表现出任何显著的膨胀特性。
The drug did not have a noticeable dilatational effect. = 该药物没有明显的扩张作用。


PHRASE->
dilatational strain: 膨胀应变
dilatational waves: 膨胀波
dilatational strength: 膨胀强度
dilatational capacity: 膨胀能力
dilatational effects: 膨胀效应
