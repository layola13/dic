The term "precurriculum" is a relatively new addition to the educational lexicon. It reflects a growing awareness of the importance of early childhood education and the impact of pre-school experiences on a child's later academic success.  It is formed by combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") with the noun "curriculum" (a course of study).
