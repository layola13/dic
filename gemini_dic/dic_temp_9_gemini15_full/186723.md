rightwisely: /ˈraɪtwʌɪzli/ | adv. | 正确地，公正地 |  This word is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, a newly coined word, likely formed by combining "right" and "wisely".  It attempts to convey the sense of acting correctly and judiciously. However, because it's not established in common usage, its meaning might be ambiguous and its usage should be avoided in formal writing.  | The judge ruled rightwisely, considering all aspects of the case. (This sentence uses the word, but it's not recommended) | justly, fairly, equitably, properly | wrongly, unjustly, unfairly | adv.
