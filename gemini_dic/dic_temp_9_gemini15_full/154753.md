persuasivenesses:/pərˈsweɪsɪvnəsɪz/ | n. | 说服力；令人信服的各种因素 | The multiple persuasivenesses of the argument finally convinced the jury.  | 近义词：powers of persuasion,  influences, appeals | 反义词：lack of conviction, unpersuasiveness


英文解析：The word "persuasivenesses" is the plural form of "persuasiveness," which refers to the quality of being able to persuade someone or of being convincing.  It implies the existence of multiple factors or aspects that contribute to the overall persuasiveness of something, such as an argument, a presentation, or a piece of writing.  While grammatically correct, it's often considered overly formal and less common than using "persuasiveness" and specifying the multiple aspects separately.
