The word "mossi" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a proper noun (perhaps a name or a place name) or a word from another language.  To provide an analysis, I would need more context on where you encountered this word.


If you can provide more information about its source or usage, I can attempt to provide a more accurate description, including potential translations, origin, and usage examples.
