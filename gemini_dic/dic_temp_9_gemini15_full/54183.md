The word "dises" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a word from a very specialized or technical field not widely known.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following your requested format.  To help you, I need the correct spelling of the word you intended.
