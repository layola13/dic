词源:
The word "doppelganger" is of German origin.  It's a compound word formed from:
* "Doppel-" (double)
* "gänger" (goer, walker)

Literally translated, it means "double-goer" or "double-walker."  The word entered English in the 19th century, largely thanks to the growing interest in German Romanticism and Gothic literature, where the concept of a doppelganger frequently appeared.
