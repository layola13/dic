词源:
The word "realizability" is derived from the verb "realize," meaning "to achieve or bring about," combined with the suffix "-ability," indicating capacity or potential.  The root "real-" ultimately stems from Latin "res," meaning "thing."  Therefore, realizability signifies the capability of a thing to be made real or achieved.
