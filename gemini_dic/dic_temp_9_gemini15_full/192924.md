词源:  The word "seaworthiness" is a combination of "sea" (referring to the ocean) and "worthiness" (meaning fit or suitable).  "Worthiness" itself derives from the Old English word "weorþ" meaning "worth" or "value".  Thus, seaworthiness literally means the "worthiness" or "fitness" of something for the sea.
