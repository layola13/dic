Etymology: The word "salpicón" originates from the Spanish language.  It's believed to derive from the verb "salpicar," meaning "to sprinkle" or "to splash," referring to the way the ingredients are combined, often in a seemingly haphazard yet delicious manner.  The culinary use likely evolved from the more general sense of a mixture or medley.
