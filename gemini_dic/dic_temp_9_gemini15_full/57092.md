词源:
The word "doughtily" derives from the Middle English word "doughty," which meant "brave, valiant, strong."  "Doughty" itself has uncertain origins, but it's possibly related to an Old English word suggesting strength or prowess.  The "-ly" suffix transforms the adjective "doughty" into the adverb "doughtily," modifying verbs to indicate the manner in which an action is performed.
