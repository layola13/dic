词源:
The word "imperilment" is derived from the verb "imperil," which in turn comes from the Old French word "empirer," meaning "to worsen" or "to make worse."  The prefix "im-" (from Latin) adds a sense of "into" or "towards," intensifying the negative connotation.  The suffix "-ment" is a noun-forming suffix indicating a state or condition.  Therefore, "imperilment" signifies the state of being brought into or subjected to danger or peril.
