词源:

The word "demerit" is derived from the Old French word "demeriter," which itself comes from the Latin word "demereri," meaning "to deserve ill," or "to be deserving of punishment."  The prefix "de-" indicates negation or deprivation, while "mereri" means "to deserve" or "to earn."  Thus, "demerits" literally means "things that deserve ill" or "undeserved things".


用法说明:

Demerits is primarily used as a plural noun. While it can be used in the singular, it's less common and often sounds slightly formal or archaic.  It typically refers to a list of flaws, shortcomings, or faults.  It is often used in formal contexts like reports, assessments, or legal documents.  In more casual conversation, synonyms like "flaws" or "shortcomings" are usually preferred.
