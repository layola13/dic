词源:
The word "dependabilities" is derived from the noun "dependability," which in turn comes from the verb "depend" and the suffix "-ability," indicating capacity or capability.  The word "depend" has origins in Old French "dependre" and ultimately from Latin "pendere," meaning "to hang."  The sense of relying on something or someone is a later development.  The addition of "-abilities" makes it a plural form, suggesting multiple aspects or instances of dependability.
