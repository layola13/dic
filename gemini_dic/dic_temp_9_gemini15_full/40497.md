词源:

From "contrive" + "-able".  "Contrive" itself comes from Old French *contriver (from Latin *con- + *triv-, related to "tribe," suggesting a coming together), originally meaning "to devise, plan, scheme".  The sense of artificiality evolved later.


用法说明:

Contrivable is primarily used to describe things that are easily created or arranged, often implying a lack of naturalness or authenticity.  It can be used to describe plans, explanations, situations, or even pieces of writing.  The word often carries a slightly negative connotation, suggesting something is overly planned or artificial.  It suggests that something was deliberately created, often to achieve a particular effect, and might not be entirely believable or natural.
