centrifugal forces:/ˌsɛnˈtrɪfjuɡəl ˈfɔːrsɪz/ | n. |离心力 |Forces that tend to move an object away from the center of rotation.  These forces are apparent when a rotating object is viewed from a rotating frame of reference. For example, when a car turns a corner, the passengers feel a force pushing them outwards. This is the centrifugal force. The force is not a "real" force in the sense that it's not caused by an interaction with another object, but rather a consequence of inertia. |例句：The centrifugal force pushed the passengers outward as the car rounded the curve.  汽车转弯时，离心力将乘客向外推。


The centrifugal force acting on the spinning top keeps it upright.  作用在旋转陀螺上的离心力使其保持直立。|近义词： outward force, reactive force |反义词：centripetal force


WORD ORIGIN->
The word "centrifugal" is derived from the Latin words "centrum" (center) and "fugere" (to flee).  Thus, it literally means "fleeing from the center".


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The centrifugal force affects the spinning object. = 离心力影响旋转物体。
Centrifugal forces are always present in rotating systems. = 旋转系统中总是存在离心力。


一般过去时:
The centrifugal force threw the mud off the wheel. = 离心力将泥土甩出车轮。
The experiment demonstrated the effects of centrifugal forces. = 实验演示了离心力的作用。


现在完成时:
Engineers have used centrifugal forces in many applications. = 工程师们已在许多应用中使用了离心力。
Scientists have studied centrifugal forces extensively. = 科学家们已经广泛研究了离心力。


过去完成时:
The washing machine had used centrifugal force to dry the clothes. = 洗衣机已经利用离心力来烘干衣服。
They had calculated the centrifugal force before starting the experiment. = 他们在开始实验之前已经计算了离心力。


将来时:
The new design will reduce centrifugal forces. = 新的设计将减少离心力。
We will use centrifugal force to separate the components. = 我们将使用离心力来分离组分。


虚拟语气:
If the centrifugal force were greater, the object would fly off. = 如果离心力更大，物体就会飞出去。
I wish I understood centrifugal forces better. = 我希望我能更好地理解离心力。


被动语态:
Centrifugal forces are utilized in many industrial processes. = 离心力被应用于许多工业过程中。
The experiment was designed to measure centrifugal forces. = 该实验旨在测量离心力。


疑问句:
What causes centrifugal forces? = 什么导致离心力？
How strong are the centrifugal forces in this situation? = 在这种情况下离心力有多强？


否定句:
The machine did not generate enough centrifugal force. = 机器没有产生足够的离心力。
There are no significant centrifugal forces in this system. = 该系统中没有明显的离心力。


PHRASE->
centrifugal pump: 离心泵
centrifugal casting:离心铸造
centrifugal compressor:离心压缩机
centrifugal clutch:离心离合器
centrifugal separator:离心分离器
