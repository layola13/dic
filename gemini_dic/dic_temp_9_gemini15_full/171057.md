WORD ORIGIN->
The word "pseudozealously" is formed by combining the following elements:

* **pseudo-**:  A prefix of Greek origin meaning "false," "sham," or "pretended."
* **zealously**: An adverb derived from "zealous," meaning "filled with or showing zeal; fervent; ardent."  "Zealous" itself comes from the Greek word "zelos," meaning "zeal," "rivalry," or "emulation."
* **-ly**: An adverbial suffix indicating manner.

Therefore, "pseudozealously" literally means "in a manner that is falsely zealous."
