词源:

The word "parametrically" is derived from the word "parameter".  "Parameter" comes from the Greek word "παράμετρος" (paramétros), which means "something measured alongside".  The suffix "-ically" is an adverbial suffix indicating "in a manner of".  Therefore, "parametrically" means "in a manner of using parameters".
