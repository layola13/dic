The word "infought" does not exist as a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis according to the requested format.  To help, I need clarification on what word was intended.  Was it a misspelling of a similar-sounding word?  Or was it a word created for a specific context?
