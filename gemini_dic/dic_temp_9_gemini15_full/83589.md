近义词：blood-borne, hematogenous (American spelling) | 反义词：non-hematogenous, locally-originating


词源:  From "haemato-" (blood) + "-genous" (producing, originating).  "Haemato-" is a variant spelling of "hemato-," both deriving from the Greek word "haima" (αἷμα), meaning "blood." "-genous" comes from the Greek "-genēs" (γενής), meaning "producing" or "originating."  Therefore, haematogenous literally means "blood-producing" or "originating in the blood."
