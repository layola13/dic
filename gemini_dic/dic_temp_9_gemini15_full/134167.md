/ˌnɒnɪmˈpjuːtətɪvnəsɪz/ | n. | 非归咎性；不归咎的特性（复数） |  The word "nonimputativenesses" is extremely rare and not found in standard dictionaries. It's likely a newly coined word or a misspelling.  It appears to be formed by adding the suffix "-nesses" (indicating a plural of abstract qualities) to "nonimputative," which itself is formed from "non-" (not) + "imputative" (attributable; implying blame or responsibility). Therefore, it suggests multiple instances of the absence of blame or the inability to attribute something.  There are no readily available examples of its usage in literature or corpora.  Finding synonyms or antonyms is difficult due to its rarity. |  (No example sentence available due to the word's rarity.) | (No synonyms available) | (No antonyms available) | n.
