词源:

The word "medusoid" is derived from the Greek word "Medusa," one of the three Gorgons in Greek mythology, famed for her snakes for hair and the ability to turn onlookers to stone.  The name was applied to jellyfish due to their often hair-like tentacles and the potentially dangerous nature of their stings.  The suffix "-oid" means "resembling" or "having the form of," thus "medusoid" means "resembling a Medusa" or "jellyfish-like."
