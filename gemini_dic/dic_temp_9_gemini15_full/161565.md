词源:

The word "pottage" comes from the Old French word "potage," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "pōtum," meaning "drink."  This reflects the fact that many early forms of pottage were more liquid than the thicker versions common today.  The shift in meaning from a thin drink to a thicker stew occurred over time.
