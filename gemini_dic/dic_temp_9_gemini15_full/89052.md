词源:
From holo- (whole) + -graph (writing, image).  The term reflects the ability of holography to record and reconstruct a complete three-dimensional image.  For the handwritten document sense, it's a direct combination of "holo" (whole) and "graph" (written), emphasizing that the entire document is written by one person.
