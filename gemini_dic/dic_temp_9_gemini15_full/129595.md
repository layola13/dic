词源：

* **non-**:  prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of".
* **com-**: prefix indicating "together" or "with" (from Latin *cum*).  In this case, it's combined with "appear" to create a sense of "being present together" (in court).
* **appear**:  verb meaning "to be present," "to be visible," or "to seem."
* **-ance**: suffix forming nouns from verbs, indicating a state, action, or quality.


Therefore, "non-compearance" literally means "not being present together" (in a legal context, usually a court).
