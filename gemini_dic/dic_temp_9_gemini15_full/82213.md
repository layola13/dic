词源:

The word "grotesquery" is derived from the Italian word "grottesco," which itself originates from the Italian word "grotta," meaning "cave."  In the Renaissance, the term "grottesco" was used to describe the bizarre and fanciful decorations found in Roman grottoes (caves). These decorations often featured hybrid creatures and distorted human figures, hence the association with the unusual and the bizarre.  The suffix "-ery" adds the sense of a state or quality.
