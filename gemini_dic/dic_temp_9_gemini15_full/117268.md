词源:

The word "mechanism" comes from the Late Middle English word "mechanisme," which is derived from the Old French "mecanisme," and ultimately from the Greek "mēkhanē" (machine, device, contrivance).  The suffix "-ism" denotes a system, practice, or doctrine. Therefore, the word's core meaning has always revolved around a system or structure, whether it's a physical machine or an abstract process.
