polymerization:/ˌpɑːlɪməraɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. | 聚合；聚合反应 | The process of combining many small molecules (monomers) to form a large molecule (polymer).  This process often involves the creation of covalent bonds between the monomers.  Examples include the formation of plastics, rubbers, and many biological macromolecules. | Example: The polymerization of ethylene produces polyethylene, a common plastic.  聚乙烯的聚合反应产生聚乙烯，一种常见的塑料。


Example:  The polymerization of styrene produces polystyrene, used in many disposable products.  苯乙烯的聚合反应产生聚苯乙烯，用于许多一次性产品。


近义词：polymerisation (英式拼写) | 反义词：depolymerization (解聚)
