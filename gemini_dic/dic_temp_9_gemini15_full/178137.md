词源:  The word "recognizable" comes from the verb "recognize," which itself has roots in the Old French word "reconnoistre," meaning "to recognize, know again."  This further derives from the Latin prefix "re-" (again) and "cognoscere" (to know). Therefore, "recognizable" literally means "able to be known again."
