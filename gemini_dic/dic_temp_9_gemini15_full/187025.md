词源:
The word "ritualism" derives from the noun "ritual" + the suffix "-ism," which indicates a system, practice, or doctrine.  "Ritual" itself originates from the Latin word "rituale," meaning "a rite" or "ceremony," ultimately related to the Latin verb "ritus," meaning "rite," "religious ceremony," or "custom."
