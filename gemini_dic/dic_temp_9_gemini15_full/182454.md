renormalizations:/ˌriːˌnɔːrməlaɪˈzeɪʃənz/ | n. | 重正规化；重新归一化 | The process of repeatedly applying a renormalization procedure to a physical theory, often to eliminate infinities or divergences in calculations.  Renormalizations are crucial in quantum field theories like quantum electrodynamics (QED) to obtain finite and physically meaningful results. |  The intricate renormalizations involved in calculating the Lamb shift demonstrate the power and necessity of this technique in QED.  重正规化过程涉及计算兰姆位移，这证明了这种技术在量子电动力学中的强大和必要性。|近义词: rescaling, regularization |反义词:  (没有直接的反义词，但可以考虑“未正规化”或"unregularized")|名词
