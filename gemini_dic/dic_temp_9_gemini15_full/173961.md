* **quasi-:**  From Latin *quasi*, meaning "as if," "almost," or "seemingly."
* **socialistically:** From "socialism," ultimately derived from the Latin *socius* ("companion," "ally") and the suffix "-ism" (denoting a doctrine or system).

Therefore, "quasi-socialistically" means "almost," "seemingly," or "in a manner resembling" socialism.
