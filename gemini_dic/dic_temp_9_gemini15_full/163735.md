The word "predeficiently" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It seems to be a neologism (newly coined word), possibly a misspelling or a deliberate creation for a specific context.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  To provide analysis, we need a valid English word.
