They are generally free-living, aquatic organisms found in freshwater and marine environments.  Planarians are known for their remarkable regenerative abilities. | Example: The researcher observed the planarida's remarkable ability to regenerate lost body parts.  研究人员观察到涡虫再生失去的身体部位的非凡能力。|近义词: flatworm, turbellarian |反义词:  None specifically, but could be contrasted with organisms lacking regenerative abilities. |名词
