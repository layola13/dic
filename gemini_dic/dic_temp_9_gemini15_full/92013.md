hyperoxide:/ˈhaɪpərɒksaɪd/|/ˈhaɪpərɑːksaɪd/| n. |超氧化物|A compound containing the superoxide ion (O₂⁻).  Hyperoxides are a class of chemical compounds characterized by the presence of the superoxide anion (O₂⁻), which is a radical anion containing two oxygen atoms and a single unpaired electron. They are highly reactive and can readily undergo redox reactions.| Example: Potassium superoxide (KO₂) is a common example of a hyperoxide and is used in oxygen masks for emergency situations.|近义词：superoxide|反义词：None specifically, but compounds without the superoxide ion could be considered antonyms in a functional sense. |名词
