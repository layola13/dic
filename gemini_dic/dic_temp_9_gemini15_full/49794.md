词源:

The word "demonlike" is a compound word.  It combines "demon," from the Greek word "daimon," meaning a spirit, deity, or fate, and "-like," a suffix indicating resemblance.  The original Greek "daimon" was not inherently evil; it could be either good or bad, but the word later evolved in English, and especially in Christianity, to primarily refer to an evil spirit.  Therefore, "demonlike" implies a resemblance to the negative aspects associated with demons – evil, cruelty, and malevolence.
