词源:
The word "physiologist" comes from the Greek words "physis" (φύσις), meaning "nature," and "logos" (λόγος), meaning "study" or "science."  Therefore, "physiology" literally means "the study of nature," specifically the functions of living organisms. The suffix "-ist" denotes a person who practices or specializes in a particular field.
