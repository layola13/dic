precollapsable: /ˌpriːkəˈlæpsəbəl/ | adj. | 可预先折叠的，可预先坍塌的 |  Describes something that can be folded or collapsed before a certain event or process.  It implies a planned or designed capability for collapse or folding, rather than a spontaneous or accidental one.  There's no widely established usage for this word, and it's likely a newly coined or rarely used term. The word is formed by combining "pre-" (before), "collapse" (to fall down suddenly), and "-able" (capable of).
