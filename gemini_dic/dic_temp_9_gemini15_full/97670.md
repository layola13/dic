词源:  The word "inhive" is a relatively recent coinage, combining the preposition "in" indicating location within and the noun "hive," referring to a beehive, to create a descriptive adjective.  The meaning extends metaphorically beyond literal beehives to describe environments of intense activity and teamwork.
