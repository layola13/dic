quanti:/ˈkwɒntaɪ/ /ˈkwɑːnti/| n. | 量；量子；定量 | A quanti is a discrete unit or amount of something, especially in physics, referring to a minimum unit of a physical property (like energy or charge).  It often implies a specific, measurable amount rather than a continuous quantity. | Example:  The theory of quantum mechanics deals with quanti of energy. 量子力学理论处理能量的量子。  The experiment measured the quanti of light emitted. 实验测量了发射光的量子。 |近义词：quantum, unit, amount |反义词：continuum, whole
