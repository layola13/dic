USAGE->

This phrase is primarily used as an adjective phrase and doesn't have tense variations like verbs do.  It describes a state of being.  Therefore, traditional tense conjugations (present, past, future, etc.) don't apply.  Instead, the tense is implied by the context of the sentence.


Example of implied tense:


Present: We're on the same page about the marketing strategy. (现在) 我们在市场策略上意见一致。

Past: We were on the same page about the budget until the unexpected costs arose. (过去) 在出现意外成本之前，我们在预算上意见一致。

Future:  With more communication, we'll be on the same page by the end of the week. (将来) 通过更多的沟通，我们将在本周末达成一致。
