This request is impossible to fulfill.  The provided format is for analyzing a single word, and "cob's" is a possessive form of "cob," requiring analysis of both.  There's no single word "cob's" to analyze in isolation.  To provide a thorough analysis, we would need separate analyses for "cob" and then an explanation of the possessive apostrophe 's.

Here's how we could handle this if you want separate analysis for "cob":

/kɒb/ | n. | 粗壮的马；圆面包；玉米芯；雄鸟；（英）煤块 | A cob is a type of strong, sturdy horse, a type of bread, the central part of an ear of corn, a male bird or a lump of coal (British English). | The farmer rode his trusty cob across the field. | steed, nag, stallion |  (Antonyms depend on the context of "cob.") | noun


USAGE->
一般现在时:

The baker sells many cobs. = 面包师卖很多圆面包。


一般过去时:
The cob pulled the cart. = 这匹马拉车。
He ate a cob for breakfast. = 他早餐吃了一个玉米面包。


现在完成时:
The farmer has ridden this cob for years. = 农民已经骑了这匹马多年了。
She has baked several cobs today. = 她今天已经烤了好几个圆面包了。


过去完成时:
He had already fed the cob before I arrived. = 我到之前他已经喂过马了。
They had eaten all the cobs by the time I got there. = 我到的时候他们已经把所有的圆面包都吃光了。


将来时:

They will bake cobs for the festival. = 他们将为节日烤制圆面包。


虚拟语气:

被动语态:

The cobs were baked in a wood-fired oven. = 圆面包是在柴火烤箱里烤制的。


疑问句:
Is that a cob? = 那是匹马吗？
Are these cobs fresh? = 这些圆面包新鲜吗？


否定句:
That is not a cob. = 那不是匹马。
They did not bake cobs today. = 他们今天没有烤圆面包。


PHRASE->
cob loaf = 圆面包
cob of corn = 玉米棒子
cobblestone = 鹅卵石路面
corn cob = 玉米芯
a sturdy cob = 一匹健壮的马


Then, a separate section explaining the possessive 's would need to be added:

**Possessive 's:** The apostrophe-s ('s) is used to show possession. It indicates that something belongs to someone or something.  For example, "cob's" means belonging to the cob (horse, bread, etc.).  The usage is the same as with any other noun that adds an 's for possession.  No further grammatical analysis or examples are needed beyond the standard possessive usage.
