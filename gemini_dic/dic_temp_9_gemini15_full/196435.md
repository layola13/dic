serpulite:/ˈsɜːrpjuˌlaɪt/| n.|管状蠕虫化石|Serpulite refers to fossilized tubes or burrows created by serpulid worms. These worms are marine polychaetes that secrete calcareous tubes for protection.  Serpulites are common fossils found in various sedimentary rocks, providing valuable information about past marine environments.  They are often studied by paleontologists to understand ancient ecosystems and the evolution of marine life.|The exposed cliff face revealed numerous serpulites, indicating a shallow marine environment existed millions of years ago.|近义词：Fossil tube, worm tube|反义词：无
