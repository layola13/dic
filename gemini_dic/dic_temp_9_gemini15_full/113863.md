词源:
The word "madhouse" is a compound word.  "Mad" comes from the Old English "gemaad," meaning "having lost one's mind,"  and "house" has its usual meaning.  The term evolved as a colloquial and somewhat derogatory term for mental asylums, reflecting the often chaotic and inhumane conditions within them historically.
