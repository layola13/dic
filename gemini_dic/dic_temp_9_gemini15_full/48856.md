deformation:/ˌdiːfɔːrˈmeɪʃən/ | n. |变形，畸形，损坏 |The alteration of the form or shape of an object or material caused by stress, strain, or other external forces.  It can be temporary or permanent, and can involve changes in size, shape, or position. |例句：The earthquake caused significant deformation of the ground. 地震导致地面严重变形。

例句：The metal underwent plastic deformation under high pressure.  金属在高压下发生了塑性变形。


近义词：distortion, misshaping, malformation, warping |反义词：formation, restoration, reformation |词性: 名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The pressure deforms the material. = 压力使材料变形。
