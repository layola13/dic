词源:
The word "healings" is derived from the verb "heal," which has Old English roots ("hǣlan").  The suffix "-ings" denotes the action or process of healing, making it a noun.  The evolution reflects the development of the concept of healing from a purely physical act to encompass a wider range of physical, mental, and spiritual restoration.
