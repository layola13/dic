Etymology:

The word is a combination of "quasi" and "obedient."

* **quasi-**:  From Latin *quasi* meaning "as if," "almost," "seemingly," indicating something that resembles or approximates but isn't fully the thing it describes.

* **obedient**: From Old French *obeissant*, from Latin *obēdiens*, present participle of *obēdīre* "to obey," from *ob- "to" + *audīre* "to hear, listen".
