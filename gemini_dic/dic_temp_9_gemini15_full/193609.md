词源:

The word is a compound of "self-" (meaning "of or by itself") + "authenticating" (the present participle of "authenticate," meaning "to verify the identity or genuineness of").  "Authenticate" ultimately derives from the Latin word "authenticus," meaning "genuine," which itself is derived from "authenticus," a derivative of "authentos," meaning "author."
