词源:
The word "rely" comes from the Old French word "relier," meaning "to bind back," "to unite," or "to connect."  This reflects the sense of dependence and connection implied in the word's modern meaning.  The prefix "re-" indicates repetition or intensification, further emphasizing the dependence.
