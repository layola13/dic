This request is impossible to fulfill completely as the word "{english's}" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a misspelling or an attempt to create a possessive form of "English."  There's no established meaning or usage for it.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., as requested in the format.  To provide a helpful response, I need a valid English word.

If you meant "English's" (possessive of English),  I can offer some information, but it will not fit the provided format perfectly because it's not a standalone word in the way "what" is.  "English's" is only used as part of a larger phrase.


If you intended to ask about the word "English," please provide that word instead.  I can then happily provide the detailed analysis according to your requested format.
