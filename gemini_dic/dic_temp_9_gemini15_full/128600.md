词源:
The word "niceties" comes from the Old French word "nicete," meaning "foolishness," "subtlety," or "delicacy."  This in turn derives from the Latin word "nescius," meaning "ignorant" or "unaware." The meaning shifted over time, evolving from something delicate or subtle to something requiring careful attention or precision, often in the context of etiquette or social behaviour.
