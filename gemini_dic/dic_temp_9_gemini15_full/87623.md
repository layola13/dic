heuristically:/hjʊərɪˈstɪkli/ | adv. |启发式地；经验法则地 | Proceeding by trial and error or by rules of thumb;  using heuristics.  This approach often involves making educated guesses or using shortcuts to solve problems, rather than relying on a strictly logical or systematic method.  It often leads to an approximate solution, but it can be significantly faster and more efficient than other methods, especially when dealing with complex or ill-defined problems. | The program solved the puzzle heuristically, finding a solution quickly but not necessarily the most optimal one. | approximately, empirically, intuitively | systematically, rigorously | 副词
