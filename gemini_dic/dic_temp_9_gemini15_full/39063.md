词源:
The word "conform" comes from the Old French word "conformer," which means "to strengthen," "to confirm," or "to make firm."  This in turn derives from the Latin "conformare," a compound of "con-" (together, thoroughly) and "formare" (to form, to shape).  The meaning evolved over time to emphasize the act of bringing something into agreement with a standard or model.
