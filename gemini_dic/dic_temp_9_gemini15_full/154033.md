词源:  The word derives from "perfume," ultimately from the Latin "per fumum" meaning "through smoke."  Originally, perfumes were used in religious ceremonies and to mask unpleasant odors. The perfumatory sense evolved from the idea of using something superficially to cover up a lack of genuine feeling or substance, like using perfume to mask a lack of personal hygiene.  The "-tory" suffix indicates an adjective meaning "relating to" or "characteristic of."
