Etymology:  The word "glamour" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "grammaire," meaning "grammar" or "magic."  The connection lies in the medieval belief that incantations and spells (associated with the study of grammar) possessed magical power. Over time, the meaning shifted from magical enchantment to a more general sense of alluring attractiveness and fascination.
