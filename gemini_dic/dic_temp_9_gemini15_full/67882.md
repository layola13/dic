fabs: /fæbz/ | n. | 绝对值 | The function fabs() returns the absolute value of a number.  It takes a single argument, which can be of type float or double, and returns a value of the same type.  For example, fabs(-3.14) returns 3.14. | The fabs() function is commonly used in mathematical calculations where the magnitude of a number is important, regardless of its sign.  For example, it's used to calculate distances, magnitudes of vectors, or to prevent negative numbers from causing errors in certain algorithms. |近义词: absolute value, magnitude | 反义词: N/A |  名词


USAGE->
There is no verb conjugation for "fabs" as it's a function name in programming contexts, not a verb.  The usage is within programming code.

Example 1 (C++):

```c++
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  double x = -5.2;
  double abs_x = fabs(x);
  std::cout << "The absolute value of " << x << " is: " << abs_x << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Output: The absolute value of -5.2 is: 5.2


Example 2 (Python):

```python
import math

x = -7.8
abs_x = math.fabs(x)
print(f"The absolute value of {x} is: {abs_x}")
```

Output: The absolute value of -7.8 is: 7.8


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases associated with "fabs" as it's a technical term.  Its use is confined to programming and mathematical contexts.
