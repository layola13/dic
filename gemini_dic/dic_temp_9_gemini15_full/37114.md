combustibility:/ˌkɒmbʌstəˈbɪləti/| n. |可燃性，易燃性|The ability of a substance to undergo combustion.  Combustibility is determined by a substance's chemical composition and its reactivity with oxygen. High combustibility indicates a material easily ignites and burns rapidly.|例句：The high combustibility of gasoline makes it a dangerous fuel.汽油的高度可燃性使其成为危险燃料。

The combustibility of this material needs to be tested before it can be used in the building.这种材料的可燃性必须在用于建筑物之前进行测试。|近义词：flammability, inflammability|反义词：non-combustibility, fire resistance


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The wood possesses high combustibility. = 这木材具有高度的可燃性。
This material shows low combustibility. = 这种材料的可燃性低。

一般过去时:
The combustibility of the fabric was tested yesterday. = 昨天测试了织物可燃性。
Scientists studied the combustibility of the new polymer. = 科学家研究了新型聚合物的可燃性。

现在完成时:
Researchers have determined the combustibility of several new materials. = 研究人员已经确定了几种新型材料的可燃性。
We have assessed the combustibility of the fuel. = 我们已经评估了燃料的可燃性。

过去完成时:
They had already known the combustibility of the gas before the experiment. = 他们在实验前就已经知道这种气体的可燃性。
Engineers had underestimated the combustibility of the building materials. = 工程师低估了建筑材料的可燃性。

将来时:
We will test the combustibility of the sample next week. = 我们下周将测试样品的可燃性。
Scientists will determine the combustibility of this substance. = 科学家将确定这种物质的可燃性。

虚拟语气:
If the combustibility were higher, the fire would spread faster. = 如果可燃性更高，火势蔓延得更快。
I wish the combustibility of this material were lower. = 我希望这种材料的可燃性更低。

被动语态:
The combustibility of the fuel was measured accurately. = 燃料的可燃性被精确测量。
The combustibility is being studied by a team of scientists. = 一组科学家正在研究可燃性。

疑问句:
What is the combustibility of this plastic? = 这种塑料的可燃性是多少？
Does this material have high combustibility? = 这种材料的可燃性高吗？

否定句:
This material does not possess high combustibility. = 这种材料不具有高度的可燃性。
The tests showed that the substance had low combustibility. = 测试表明该物质的可燃性低。


PHRASE->
high combustibility = 高可燃性
low combustibility = 低可燃性
degree of combustibility = 可燃程度
test for combustibility = 可燃性测试
limit of combustibility = 可燃性极限

词源:
combust (燃烧) + -ibility (后缀，表示“能力”或“性质”)  源于拉丁语 *combūrere (燃烧)
