词源：

The word "objectionable" comes from the verb "object" and the suffix "-able."  "Object" ultimately derives from the Latin word "ob-," meaning "against," and "iacere," meaning "to throw."  Thus, the original sense was to throw something against something else, to oppose or resist. The suffix "-able" means "capable of being" or "worthy of being."  Therefore, "objectionable" literally means "capable of being objected to."
