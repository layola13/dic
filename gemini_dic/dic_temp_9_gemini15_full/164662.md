preexpirations:/ˌpriːˌɛkspɪˈreɪʃənz/| n.| 预先到期；提前到期 | The word "preexpirations" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism,  likely formed by combining "pre" (before) and "expirations" (the acts of expiring or coming to an end).  It would suggest instances of something expiring before its scheduled time.  Its meaning would depend heavily on context.  For example, it might refer to the early termination of multiple contracts or the premature end of several processes. There are no standard dictionaries listing this word. | 例句：The report detailed the preexpirations of several key contracts, leading to significant financial losses.  （这份报告详细说明了几份关键合同的提前到期，导致了重大的经济损失。）  |近义词: premature terminations, early expirations, pre-terminations |反义词: extensions, renewals |名词
