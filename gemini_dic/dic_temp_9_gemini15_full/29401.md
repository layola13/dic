catachrestic:/ˌkætəˈkrestɪk/| adj.| 滥用修辞的；牵强的；不恰当的 |  Using a word in a way that is not its usual or proper meaning; inappropriately metaphorical.  It describes a figure of speech where a word or phrase is applied to an object or action to which it is not literally applicable. This often results in a striking or unusual image but can also be considered strained or forced.  | Example:  The "leg" of a table is a catachrestic use of the word "leg," as a table doesn't have biological legs.  Another example is "the mouth of a river," a metaphorical extension. | 近义词: strained, forced, inappropriate, misused, improper | 反义词: apt, appropriate, accurate, precise |
