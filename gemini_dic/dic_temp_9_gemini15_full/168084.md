The word "priyam" is not an English word.  It's a word from Sanskrit. Therefore, a standard English word analysis is not possible.  However, I can provide information on its Sanskrit origins and meaning.

/priːjəm/ | n. |挚爱，所爱之人，珍爱之物 |  Priyam (प्रियम्) in Sanskrit means "beloved," "dear," "pleasant," or "object of affection." It is a noun, often used as a term of endearment or to describe something highly valued.  It's a masculine singular noun in the nominative case. |  Example:  This beautiful painting is my priyam. (This beautiful painting is my beloved/treasure.) |  Near Synonyms (depending on context): darling, sweetheart, treasure, favorite | Antonyms: hated, despised, loathed |  n.


USAGE->
This word doesn't have verb conjugations like "what" in English.  It's a noun and functions as such.  Example usages would center around its noun function.

Simple sentences:
मेरा प्रियम् पुस्तक है। (Merā priyam pustaka hai.) = My beloved book is.


Complex sentences:
मुझे अपना प्रियम् चित्र बहुत पसंद है। (Mujhe apnā priyam citra bahut pasand hai.) = I really like my beloved painting.


PHRASE->
Because "priyam" is a single word with a specific meaning, it doesn't readily form common phrases in the same way English words do.  Phrases would depend on how it's used in a sentence with other words.  For example, one might use it in a phrase like:

प्रियम् मित्र (priyam mitra) = beloved friend

यह मेरा प्रियम् है (yah merā priyam hai) = This is my beloved


Note: The romanization of Sanskrit words can vary.  The provided pronunciation is an approximation.  The examples given in Devanagari script (Hindi) are to show proper usage in a sentence.  Direct translation to English can often lose some of the nuance of the original Sanskrit.
