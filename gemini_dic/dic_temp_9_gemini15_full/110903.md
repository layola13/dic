The word "lipaya" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Please double-check the spelling.

2. **It's a proper noun:** It might be a name (person, place, or thing) specific to a certain region or culture.  More context is needed.

3. **It's a word from another language:**  It could be a word borrowed from another language, and its meaning would depend on its origin.  If you can provide the language of origin, I can try to help.

4. **It's a neologism or slang:** It might be a newly coined word or slang term not yet widely recognized.
