词源:

The word "pall-bearer" is a compound word.  "Pall" comes from the Old French "pal," meaning "cloth," referring to the cloth that covered a coffin. "Bearer" comes from the Old English "beran," meaning "to carry."  Therefore, a pall-bearer literally means someone who carries the cloth-covered coffin.
