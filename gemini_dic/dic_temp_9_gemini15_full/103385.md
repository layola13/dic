词源:The term "jingoistic" originates from a late 19th-century British patriotic song, "The Jingo," which celebrated British imperialism and promoted aggressive nationalism.  The word "Jingo" itself is of uncertain origin, possibly a slang term for a hawkish nationalist. The song popularized the term, and it quickly entered the lexicon to describe excessive or aggressive patriotism.
