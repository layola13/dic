siphuncle:/ˈsɪfʌŋkəl/| n. | 鹦鹉螺的虹管；(植物)筛管 | A siphon, especially the tube running through the chambers of a nautilus shell that is used for regulating the amount of gas in each chamber to control buoyancy.  In botany, it refers to sieve tubes in plants. |例句：The siphuncle in the nautilus shell is a remarkable example of biological engineering.  鹦鹉螺壳中的虹管是生物工程的杰出例子。

The siphuncle allows the nautilus to control its buoyancy by adjusting the gas and liquid in its chambers. 虹管允许鹦鹉螺通过调节腔室内的气体和液体来控制其浮力。|近义词：tube, conduit (in the context of function) |反义词：None specifically, but terms implying lack of internal structure or regulation could be considered opposites in context.
