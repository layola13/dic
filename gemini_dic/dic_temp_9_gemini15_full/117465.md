词源:
The word "medium-term" is a compound word formed from "medium" and "term."  "Medium" comes from the Old French *meien, from Latin *medius ("middle"). "Term" comes from Old French terme, from Latin terminus ("boundary, limit, end").  Therefore, "medium-term" literally means a "middle length of time."
