isomorphic:/ˌaɪsoʊˈmɔːrfɪk/ | adj. | 同构的；同形的 |  Exhibiting isomorphism; having the same structure.  Isomorphic structures or systems have the same underlying form or organization, even if their elements or components differ.  For example, two graphs are isomorphic if there is a one-to-one correspondence between their vertices and edges that preserves the adjacency relationships. In mathematics,  isomorphism refers to a structure-preserving map between two structures of the same type. | The two chemical compounds are isomorphic, despite their different names.  = 两种化学化合物尽管名称不同，但结构相同。


The chemical structures are isomorphic. = 这些化学结构是同构的。 | synonymous: structurally similar, equivalent (in structure) | antonyms: dissimilar, heteromorphic |
