The word "refrustrating" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  However, we can analyze its potential meaning and structure based on its components.

It appears to be a combination of "re-" and "frustrating."

* **re- (prefix):**  Meaning "again," "back," "repetition," or "reverse."

* **frustrating (adjective):**  Causing feelings of frustration; annoying, irritating, or disappointing.


Let's assume it's meant to imply "frustrating again" or "repeatedly frustrating."  If so, we can create a hypothetical entry:


refrustrating: /ˌriːfrʌˈstreɪtɪŋ/ | adj. |再次令人沮丧的；反复令人沮丧的 | Causing feelings of frustration repeatedly;  making someone feel frustrated again or anew.  This word is not found in standard dictionaries and should be avoided in formal writing.  Consider using synonyms like "repeatedly frustrating," "continuously frustrating," or "increasingly frustrating." |
