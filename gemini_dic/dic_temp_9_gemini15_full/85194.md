The word "hariali" is not an English word.  It's a word from Hindi and Urdu, meaning greenery or lush vegetation.  Therefore, a standard English word analysis is not applicable.  However, I can provide information about the word within its original language context.

hariali: /həriˈɑːliː/ | n. |绿意盎然，葱茏；翠绿 |  The word "hariali" refers to the vibrant green color of lush vegetation. It evokes a sense of freshness, vitality, and abundance in nature.  The word is commonly used to describe a landscape full of plants, trees, and fields.


例句:

The hariali of the valley was breathtaking.  山谷的绿意令人叹为观止。

The monsoon season brought a burst of hariali to the parched land. 季风季节给干旱的土地带来了勃勃生机。


近义词 (in Hindi/Urdu):  हरापन (haraapan), हरियाली (hariyali - a close synonym, sometimes used interchangeably),  पर्णहरित (parnahrit -  literally "chlorophyll", but conveys the same sense of greenness)


反义词 (in Hindi/Urdu):  सूखा (sookha - dryness), बंजर (banjar - barren), उजाड़ (ujaad - desolate)


词性:  Noun (feminine)


Note:  Because "hariali" is not an English word, there's no English word usage analysis possible in the same way as for English words.  The grammatical structures and tense variations described in your example would apply to English sentences *using* the word "greenery" as a translation, not to the Hindi/Urdu word itself.
