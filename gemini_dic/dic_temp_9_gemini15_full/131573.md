noncommutativities:/ˌnɒnkɒmjuːtəˈtɪvɪtiz/| n. |非交换性，不可交换性|The property of a mathematical operation or system where the order of the operands affects the result.  For example, in matrix multiplication, AB is not necessarily equal to BA. This contrasts with commutative operations, like addition, where the order doesn't matter (a + b = b + a).  Noncommutativities are often studied in abstract algebra and quantum mechanics.|Example:  The noncommutativities of matrix multiplication are crucial in quantum mechanics.|近义词：non-commutativity (singular)|反义词：commutativity
