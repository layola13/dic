pretrainings:/ˌpriːˈtreɪnɪŋz/ | n. | 预训练 | The process of training a machine learning model on a large dataset before fine-tuning it for a specific task.  Pretrainings often involve unsupervised learning techniques to learn general features from the data.  This allows the model to start with a strong foundation and requires less data and computational resources for the specific task. | Example: The researchers used extensive pretrainings on a massive text corpus before adapting the model for sentiment analysis.  研究人员在大型文本语料库上进行了广泛的预训练，然后才将模型用于情感分析。|近义词：pre-training, initial training | 反义词：finetuning


USAGE->

一般现在时:
Pretraining improves model performance. = 预训练提高了模型性能。
