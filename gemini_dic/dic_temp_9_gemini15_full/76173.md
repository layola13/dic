fusome:/ˈfjuːsoʊm/| n. |融合体，胞质桥|A fusome is a structure found in the cytoplasm of germline cells in many species, particularly in insects. It's a complex interconnected network of cytoplasmic bridges that connect the cells during oogenesis (egg development) or spermatogenesis (sperm development).  These bridges facilitate the exchange of cytoplasm and organelles, ensuring that all the cells receive the necessary components for development. The fusome plays a crucial role in coordinating cell division and differentiation during germline development.|Example: The fusome's intricate network ensures proper cytokinesis and cell fate determination during oogenesis.|近义词：cytoplasmic bridge, intercellular bridge|反义词：N/A
