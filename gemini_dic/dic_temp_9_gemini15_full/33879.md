WORD ORIGIN->
The word "circumspectness" is derived from the Latin word "circumspectus," which is the past participle of "circumspicere."  "Circum" means "around" or "about," and "spicere" means "to look" or "to see."  Therefore, "circumspicere" literally means "to look around" or "to look carefully."  The suffix "-ness" turns the adjective "circumspect" into a noun, indicating the quality or state of being circumspect.
