词源:
The word "sherbet" ultimately derives from the Persian word "sharbat," meaning "drink," or more specifically, a "sweetened drink."  Through Arabic (sharbat) and Turkish (şerbet), the word entered various European languages, eventually evolving into the English "sherbet," though the meaning shifted somewhat from a drink to a frozen dessert.
