nondispersions:/ˌnɒnˌdɪsˈpɜːʒənz/| n.|非分散；无色散|The absence of dispersion or scattering of light or other waves.|例句：The optical system exhibits excellent nondispersions, resulting in sharp images.  该光学系统表现出极好的无色散性，从而产生清晰的图像。|近义词：non-diffusion, homogeneity|反义词：dispersion, scattering|名词


USAGE->
This word is relatively uncommon and doesn't have typical verb conjugations like "what" does.  Its usage is primarily as a noun describing a lack of dispersion. Therefore, standard verb tense examples are inapplicable.

一般现在时:
Nondispersions are essential for high-resolution imaging. = 高分辨率成像需要无色散性。
The material shows excellent nondispersions properties. = 该材料表现出优异的无色散特性。


一般过去时:
Nondispersions were observed in the experiment. = 在实验中观察到无色散现象。
The researchers achieved high levels of nondispersions. = 研究人员实现了高水平的无色散。


现在完成时:
Scientists have demonstrated nondispersions in novel materials. = 科学家已经证明了新型材料中的无色散性。
We have observed consistent nondispersions throughout the testing. = 在整个测试过程中，我们观察到一致的无色散现象。


过去完成时:
Before the improvement, significant dispersions had been present, but now nondispersions are achieved. = 改进之前存在明显的色散，但现在已经实现了无色散。
They had expected dispersions, but the nondispersions surprised them. = 他们预料到会有色散，但无色散现象令他们吃惊。


将来时:
Future research will focus on achieving better nondispersions in optical fibers. = 未来的研究将集中在实现光纤中更好的无色散性。
We will see more applications of nondispersions in telecommunications. = 我们将在电信领域看到更多无色散的应用。


虚拟语气:
If we had better nondispersions, the images would be sharper. = 如果我们有更好的无色散性，图像就会更清晰。
It is essential that nondispersions be maintained for optimal performance. = 为了获得最佳性能，必须保持无色散性。


被动语态:
High levels of nondispersions were achieved by the new method. = 新方法实现了高水平的无色散。
Nondispersions are ensured by the precise alignment of the components. = 零件的精确对准确保了无色散性。


疑问句:
Are nondispersions crucial for this application? = 无色散性对这个应用至关重要吗？
What factors affect the degree of nondispersions observed? = 哪些因素会影响观察到的无色散程度？


否定句:
The system did not exhibit complete nondispersions. = 该系统没有表现出完全的无色散性。
There were significant dispersions; nondispersions were not achieved. = 存在明显的色散；没有实现无色散。


PHRASE->
There are few established phrases directly using "nondispersions".  The word's usage is largely within scientific and technical contexts.  Phrases would be built around the concept rather than a specific collocation. Examples below illustrate the contextual usage:

degree of nondispersions: 无色散程度
high level of nondispersions: 高水平的无色散
conditions for nondispersions: 无色散条件
absence of nondispersions:  无色散的缺乏 (implies dispersion is present)
achieve nondispersions: 实现无色散
