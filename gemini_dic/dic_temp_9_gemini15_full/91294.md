hydrolysis:/haɪˈdrɑːlɪsɪs/ | n. |水解|The chemical breakdown of a compound due to reaction with water.  Hydrolysis is a common type of reaction in which a molecule is cleaved into two or more smaller molecules by the addition of a water molecule.  It often involves the breaking of a bond and the addition of a hydrogen ion (H+) to one fragment and a hydroxyl ion (OH-) to the other. |Example: The hydrolysis of starch produces simple sugars.  淀粉的水解产生单糖。

The hydrolysis of proteins yields amino acids. 蛋白质的水解产生氨基酸。|近义词：decomposition, cleavage |反义词：dehydration synthesis, condensation

How is the hydrolysis monitored? = 如何监测水解？


否定句:
Hydrolysis did not occur under these conditions. = 在这些条件下没有发生水解。
The reaction did not proceed to complete hydrolysis. = 反应没有进行到完全水解。


PHRASE->
acid hydrolysis 酸水解
alkaline hydrolysis 碱水解
enzymatic hydrolysis 酶水解
hydrolysis reaction 水解反应
partial hydrolysis 部分水解


词源:
The word "hydrolysis" comes from the Greek words "hydro" (ὕδωρ), meaning "water," and "lysis" (λύσις), meaning "loosening" or "breaking down."  Therefore, hydrolysis literally means "breaking down with water."
