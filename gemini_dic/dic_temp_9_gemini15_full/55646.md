词源:
The word "dither" comes from the Middle English word "didderen," meaning "to tremble" or "to shake." This sense is still present in some modern uses.  The meaning of "to hesitate" or "to be indecisive" developed later.  The application to image processing (抖动) is a more recent development related to the effect of the process on the image.
