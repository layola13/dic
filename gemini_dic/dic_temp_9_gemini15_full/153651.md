pentosane:/ˈpentəseɪn/| n. |戊聚糖|A type of hemicellulose, a complex carbohydrate found in plant cell walls, particularly in cereals such as wheat, rye, oats, and barley.  It's a polymer composed of pentose sugars (five-carbon sugars). Pentosans are known for their water-holding capacity and their ability to form viscous solutions. They are used in various industrial applications, including food processing and the production of adhesives.|例句：The high pentosane content in this wheat variety contributes to its excellent dough-forming properties.  这种小麦品种的高戊聚糖含量使其具有优异的面团形成特性。|近义词：hemicellulose|反义词：N/A
