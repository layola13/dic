/mɪsˈtaɪd/| n.| 迷失的潮汐；(比喻)混乱时期 | A mistide is a period of confusion or disorder, often likened to a tide that has lost its way.  It's a relatively rare and literary word.  There are no direct examples of its usage in common corpora because it is not a frequently used word.  However, the meaning can be understood through its component parts: "mis-" (wrong, bad) and "tide" (a flow of water).  Therefore, a "mistide" suggests a disordered or erratic flow,  applicable to events or circumstances rather than just water. |  The political mistide left the nation adrift.  (政治动荡使国家四分五裂) | 近义词：turmoil, chaos, upheaval | 反义词：order, calm, stability | 名词
