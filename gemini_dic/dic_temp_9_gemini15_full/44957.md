cryptozoon:/ˈkrɪptoʊzoʊn/| n.|隐生动物|A cryptozoon is a fossil structure formed by the growth of colonies of organisms, especially cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), that creates a distinctive layered or concentric structure. These structures are often found in ancient sedimentary rocks and provide evidence of early life on Earth.|Example:  The researchers discovered numerous cryptozoans in the Precambrian rock formations.|近义词: stromatolite|反义词: N/A
