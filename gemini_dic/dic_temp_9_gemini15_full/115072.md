/mænˈiːθoʊ/ | n. | 曼涅托 | Manetho (/mænˈiːθoʊ/), or Manetone, was an Egyptian priest and historian who lived during the Ptolemaic period (332–30 BC).  He is best known for his Aegyptiaca, a now-lost history of Egypt in three books that covered the reigns of the gods and pharaohs, from the mythical beginnings to his own time. His work was a primary source for later Greek and Roman historians writing about Egypt, even though it is now largely known through fragments and summaries.  | Manetho's Aegyptiaca greatly influenced later accounts of ancient Egyptian history, though its accuracy is debated.  Many scholars believe his work reflects the biases and perspectives of his time and cultural context, rather than a completely objective historical account.  |  近义词: (no direct synonyms, as he is a specific historical figure) | 反义词: (no direct antonyms) | n.
