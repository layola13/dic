词源:
The word "posh" itself has an uncertain origin. One popular theory links it to the acronym "Port Out, Starboard Home," used by British sailors to indicate preferred cabins on ocean liners.  These cabins, located on the more sheltered sides of the ship during particular voyages, were considered more luxurious and thus associated with wealth and privilege.  "Poshness," therefore, is a noun derived from the adjective "posh," reflecting the quality or state of being posh.
