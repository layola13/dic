词源:
The word "lipothymic" comes from the Greek words  λίπος (lipos) meaning "abandonment," "desertion," or "fainting" and θυμός (thumos) meaning "soul," "spirit," "mind," or "anger."  The combination suggests a state of abandoning one's spirit or mind, leading to fainting.  The word entered English through Late Latin and Old French.
