cotransducing:/ˌkoʊtrænzˈduːsɪŋ/ | v. | 共同转导 | The process in which two or more genes are transferred together from one bacterium to another by transduction.  This occurs when the genes are located close together on the bacterial chromosome and are packaged into the same phage particle during transduction. | Example:  The researchers observed cotransducing of the antibiotic resistance genes.  研究人员观察到抗生素抗性基因的共同转导。 |近义词: cotransmission (in a broader context) | 反义词:  None directly opposite, but the opposite would be independent transduction where genes are transferred separately.


USAGE->

The frequency of cotransduction was determined by statistical analysis. = 共同转导的频率是通过统计分析确定的。

疑问句:
Do these genes cotransduce frequently in this bacterial strain? = 在这种细菌菌株中，这些基因是否经常共同转导？
