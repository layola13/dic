kilobit:/ˈkɪləbɪt/| n. |千比特；千位元|A kilobit (kb) is a unit of digital information equal to 1,000 bits.  It's often used to measure data transfer rates or storage capacity, although in some contexts, it might refer to 1024 bits (2^10 bits) due to the binary nature of computer systems.  The term is commonly abbreviated as kb or Kb.|例句：The modem transferred data at a rate of 56 kilobits per second. 调制解调器以每秒 56 千比特的速度传输数据。

The internet connection speed is advertised as 100 kilobits per second.  互联网连接速度宣传为每秒 100 千比特。|近义词：bit,  megabit (larger unit)|反义词：None (it's a unit of measurement)|名词


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The file size is 10 kilobits. = 文件大小是10千比特。
The download speed is 50 kilobits per second. = 下载速度是每秒50千比特。


一般过去时:
The data transfer rate was 20 kilobits per second. = 数据传输速率为每秒20千比特。
The old modem only supported 56 kilobits per second. = 旧调制解调器仅支持每秒56千比特。


现在完成时:
We have downloaded a file of 200 kilobits. = 我们已经下载了一个200千比特的文件。
The server has transferred more than 1000 kilobits of data. = 服务器已传输超过1000千比特的数据。


过去完成时:
They had already sent 500 kilobits before the connection dropped. = 在连接中断之前，他们已经发送了500千比特。
The system had processed over a million kilobits by the end of the day. = 到当天结束时，系统已经处理了超过一百万千比特的数据。


将来时:
The new network will support speeds up to 1000 kilobits per second. = 新网络将支持高达每秒1000千比特的速度。
We will need at least 500 kilobits of storage for this project. = 这个项目至少需要500千比特的存储空间。


虚拟语气:
If the download speed were 100 kilobits per second, it would be much faster. = 如果下载速度是每秒100千比特，它会快得多。
I wish the file size was only 1 kilobit. = 我希望文件大小只有1千比特。


被动语态:
The data was transmitted at 10 kilobits per second. = 数据以每秒10千比特的速度传输。
The information is being received at a rate of 50 kilobits per second. = 信息正在以每秒50千比特的速度接收。


疑问句:
How many kilobits are in this file? = 这个文件有多少千比特？
What is the maximum kilobits per second this connection can handle? = 此连接可以处理的最大每秒千比特数是多少？


否定句:
The file does not exceed 10 kilobits. = 文件不超过10千比特。
The transfer speed was not as high as 100 kilobits per second. = 传输速度不如每秒100千比特高。


PHRASE->
kilobits per second (kbps) = 每秒千比特
kilobit rate = 千比特率
kilobit storage = 千比特存储
data in kilobits = 千比特数据
transfer kilobits = 传输千比特
