The word "overnoble" is not a common word. It's a relatively rare compound adjective formed by combining the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessively") with the adjective "noble" (meaning having or showing fine personal qualities or high moral principles and ideals).  There is no specific etymological history beyond the simple combination of these two existing words.
