词源:

* **noneffervescently** is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adverb "effervescently".

* **effervescently** is derived from the adjective "effervescent", which comes from the Late Latin word "effervescere," meaning "to boil up, bubble." This in turn derives from "ex-" (out) + "fervere" (to boil).
