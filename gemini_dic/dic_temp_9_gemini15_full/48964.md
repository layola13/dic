词源:
The word "degenerate" comes from the Latin word "degenerare," which means "to deviate from the original type or standard."  The prefix "de-" means "away from" or "down from," and "generare" means "to produce" or "to beget."  Thus, the original meaning implied a decline from an original, superior state.
