词源:
The word "cribber" ultimately derives from the Middle English word "cribbe," meaning a manger or feeding trough for animals.  The sense of "copying" developed from the idea of secretly taking something, like a student secretly taking notes or answers from a hidden source, much like an animal feeding from a manger.  The association with a baby's crib might be a more recent development, linked to the idea of a safe and sheltered place, but the primary meaning remains connected to cheating.
