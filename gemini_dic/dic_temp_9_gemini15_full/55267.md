词源:

The word "dissipatedness" is derived from the adjective "dissipated," which itself comes from the verb "dissipate."

* **Dissipate:**  This verb originates from the Latin word "dissipare," which combines "dis-" (apart, away) and "sipare" (to scatter, disperse).  Therefore, the original meaning was to scatter or disperse something.  Over time, it acquired the figurative meaning of squandering resources or indulging in excessive pleasure.

* **Dissipated (adjective):**  This adjective describes someone or something characterized by this scattering or excessive indulgence.

* **Dissipatedness (noun):**  This noun is formed by adding the suffix "-ness," which transforms an adjective into a noun, denoting the state or quality of being dissipated.  The added 's' at the end indicates the possessive form, showing that something belongs to or is characteristic of dissipatedness.
