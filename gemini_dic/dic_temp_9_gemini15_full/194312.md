self-penetrabilities: /ˌsɛlf ˌpɛnɪtrəˈbɪlətiz/ | n. | 自我渗透性；自身穿透性 |  The ability of a substance or system to penetrate or permeate itself. This term is often used in specialized contexts, such as material science or physics, to describe the ability of a material to allow its own components to move through it.  For example, it might describe the ease with which water molecules move through a hydrogel, or the extent to which ions can migrate within a solid electrolyte.  The term is relatively uncommon and might require further context to fully understand its meaning in a specific scenario.  |  The high self-penetrabilities of the polymer allowed for rapid self-healing.  高分子材料的高自我渗透性使其能够快速自愈。|  self-diffusion, permeability |  impermeability | n.
