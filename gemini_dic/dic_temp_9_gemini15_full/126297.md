myodynamometer:/ˌmaɪoʊdaɪnæˈmɒmɪtər/ | n. |肌动力计 |A myodynamometer is an instrument used to measure the strength of muscles.  It typically involves applying resistance to a muscle group and measuring the force exerted in response. Different types of myodynamometers exist, each measuring strength in various ways. |The physiotherapist used a myodynamometer to assess the patient's leg strength after surgery.  物理治疗师用肌动力计评估病人术后腿部力量。  |近义词：muscle strength tester, dynamometer (more general)|反义词：N/A

词源:
The word "myodynamometer" is a combination of three Greek and Latin roots:

* **myo- (μυο-)**:  From the Greek word μυς (mys), meaning "muscle."
* **dynamo- (δύναμις)**: From the Greek word δύναμις (dynamis), meaning "power" or "strength."
* **-meter**: From the Greek word μέτρον (metron), meaning "measure."

Therefore, myodynamometer literally means "muscle strength measuring instrument."
