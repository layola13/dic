semirigorous: /ˌsɛmiˈrɪɡərəs/ | adj. | 半严密的；不完全严谨的 |  Relating to or characterized by a method or system that is partly rigorous but not entirely so;  approximating rigor but lacking complete precision or formality. It often implies a balance between thoroughness and practicality, sometimes accepting approximations or heuristics when complete rigor is unattainable or impractical. |  The professor's semirigorous approach to the proof allowed for a quicker understanding but sacrificed some mathematical precision.  | 近义词: approximate, inexact, loose, informal | 反义词: rigorous, exact, precise, formal

Should we employ a more rigorous or semirigorous method? = 我们应该采用更严谨的方法还是半严谨的方法？


否定句:
This is not a rigorous proof; it's only semirigorous. = 这不是一个严谨的证明；它只是半严谨的。
We did not use a completely rigorous methodology; our approach was semirigorous. = 我们没有使用完全严谨的方法；我们的方法是半严谨的。


PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases specifically using "semirigorous".  The word is primarily used as an adjective to describe a method or approach.  Phrases would instead describe the *method* itself,  e.g., "a semirigorous mathematical proof," "a semirigorous approximation,"  "a semirigorous analysis".
