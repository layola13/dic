USAGE->
This word is a relatively new coinage and doesn't have established grammatical usages like common verbs or nouns.  Its usage is primarily limited to academic and technical writing, where it describes the complex interwoven nature of multiple elements.  Therefore, standard grammatical tenses and moods are not directly applicable in the same way as with common words.  Instead, examples focus on how the noun "intercomplexity" is used in sentences.
