词源:

From Late Latin *encomium, from Greek ἐγκώμιον (enkōmion), from ἐγκωμιάζειν (enkōmiazein) "to praise," from ἐγκαίω (enkaiō) "I celebrate," from ἐν (en) "in" + καίω (kaiō) "I burn."  The original sense referred to a celebratory song or hymn, often performed at a festival.


用法说明:

Encomiums are typically plural, reflecting the abundance of praise.  While a single encomium is possible, it is less common.  The word implies a formal or elevated tone of praise, going beyond simple compliments.  It suggests a significant achievement or quality deserving of public acknowledgment.  Encomiums are often used in formal settings, such as literary reviews, award ceremonies, or obituaries.
