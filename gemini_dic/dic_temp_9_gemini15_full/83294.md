gynandromorph:/ˌɡaɪnænˈdrɒmɔːrf/|/ˌɡaɪnænˈdrɒmɔːrf/| n. |雌雄嵌合体|A gynandromorph is an organism that contains both male and female characteristics. This is usually due to a genetic mutation during development, resulting in a mosaic of male and female tissues.  The organism may display bilateral gynandromorphism, where one half of the body is male and the other half is female, or it can exhibit a more complex pattern of male and female traits throughout its body. |Example: The butterfly displayed striking bilateral gynandromorphism, with one wing exhibiting male coloration and the other female coloration.  这只蝴蝶展现出明显的两侧雌雄嵌合现象，其中一只翅膀呈现雄性颜色，另一只翅膀呈现雌性颜色。|近义词：hermaphrodite (but not a perfect synonym, as hermaphrodites possess both male and female reproductive organs, while gynandromorphs have a mosaic of male and female tissues)|反义词：monomorphic (having only one form)|名词
