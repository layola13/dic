注意事项:

The adjective "retarded" is highly offensive when used to describe a person with intellectual disabilities.  Avoid using this word entirely.  Instead, use person-first language and appropriate clinical terms like "person with an intellectual disability" or "person with a developmental delay." The word is acceptable when referring to slowing or delaying a process, such as growth or progress.
