词源:
From Middle English *riotousnesse, from riotous + -nesse.  Ultimately derived from Old French *riote, a variant of Old French *route, meaning "a breaking up or disturbance", ultimately from the Vulgar Latin *rupta, the past participle of rumpere, "to break".  The "-ness" suffix indicates a state or condition.
