词源:
The word "inevitable" comes from the Old French word "inevitable," which itself derives from the Latin word "inevitabilis."  "In-" is a negative prefix (meaning "not"), "vitare" means "to avoid," and "-bilis" is a suffix forming adjectives meaning "capable of being."  Therefore, "inevitabilis" literally means "not capable of being avoided."
