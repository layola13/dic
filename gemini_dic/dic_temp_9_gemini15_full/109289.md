lemuria:/ləˈmʊəriə/| n. |姆大陆，狐猴之乡|A hypothetical continent, now submerged, that was once thought to have existed in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar.  The name is associated with the lemur, a primate found on Madagascar and nearby islands.  The existence of Lemuria is not supported by geological evidence.  |例句：The theory of Lemuria, a lost continent in the Indian Ocean, captivated many scientists in the 19th century.  姆大陆，一个存在于印度洋的失落大陆的理论，在19世纪吸引了许多科学家。


The concept of Lemuria was initially proposed in the 19th century to explain the biogeographic distribution of lemurs, which are found primarily on Madagascar and nearby islands.  Scientists at the time hypothesized that these primates originated from a now-submerged landmass that connected Madagascar to other continents.  This concept, however, is largely rejected by modern geology, which doesn't support the existence of such a large continent. The idea of Lemuria has persisted in popular culture, often appearing in fictional works and pseudoscientific theories.
