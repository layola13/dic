词源:

From the verb "interfere," which comes from the Late Latin *interferre, a combination of *inter- ("between," "among") and *ferre ("to carry," "to bring").  The sense evolved to mean "to clash," "to collide," and then to "intervene" or "meddle." The "-ers" suffix indicates the plural form of the agent noun, denoting those who perform the action of interfering.
