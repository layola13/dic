词源：

The word "helter-skelter" originates from the Old English "hilder-skalder,"  a combination of "hilder" (meaning "hillock" or "small hill") and "skalder" (meaning "to slide or glide").  This suggests a connection to the image of sliding down a steep hill in a haphazard manner.  The addition of "-iness" creates a noun to describe the state or quality of being helter-skelter.  Over time, the original meaning has evolved to encompass a more general sense of disorder and confusion.
