prosyllogism:/ˌprɒsɪˈlɒdʒɪzəm/| n. |三段论的附带论证；附随论证|A prosyllogism is a syllogism that is used to prove a premise of another syllogism.  It's a subsidiary or secondary argument used to support a main argument.  Essentially, it's a smaller syllogism embedded within a larger one. |Example:  The main syllogism might be: All men are mortal, Socrates is a man, therefore Socrates is mortal.  A prosyllogism could then be used to prove the premise "All men are mortal," perhaps by arguing: All animals are mortal, all men are animals, therefore all men are mortal. |近义词: subsidiary argument, supporting argument |反义词: main argument, primary argument
