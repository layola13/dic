词源:
The word "disembarked" comes from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "away from" or "opposite of") and the verb "embark," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "embarquer," itself from "en" (in) + "barque" (a ship or boat).  Therefore, "disembark" literally means "to go away from a ship" or "to leave a ship."
