The word "landlouping" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a regional dialect word, or a newly coined term.  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown is impossible.  To provide a response in the requested format, I need a valid English word.  Please provide a different word.
