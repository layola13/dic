endosmotic:/ˌɛndoʊˈzmɑːtɪk/| adj.|内渗的；内吸的|Relating to or characterized by endosmosis, the passage of a fluid through a semipermeable membrane into a cell or other structure.|Example: The endosmotic pressure within the cell caused it to swell.  细胞内的内渗压导致其膨胀。|近义词：inward-flowing, inwardly directed|反义词：exosmotic


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The endosmotic pressure is high. = 内渗压很高。
Endosmosis occurs in many biological processes. = 内渗作用发生在许多生物过程中。


一般过去时:
The cell swelled due to endosmosis. = 细胞由于内渗而膨胀。
Endosmosis was observed under the microscope. = 在显微镜下观察到内渗作用。


现在完成时:
Endosmosis has significantly affected the cell's volume. = 内渗作用已显著影响了细胞的体积。
Scientists have studied endosmosis for many years. = 科学家们已经研究内渗作用多年了。


过去完成时:
The cell had already undergone significant endosmosis before the experiment. = 在实验之前，细胞已经经历了显著的内渗作用。
They had not anticipated the extent of endosmosis. = 他们没有预料到内渗作用的程度。


将来时:
The researchers will observe endosmosis in the next experiment. = 研究人员将在下一次实验中观察内渗作用。
Endosmosis will likely cause the cell to burst. = 内渗作用可能会导致细胞破裂。


虚拟语气:
If the membrane were permeable, endosmosis would occur rapidly. = 如果膜是可渗透的，内渗作用会迅速发生。
It is important that endosmosis be controlled in this experiment. = 在这个实验中控制内渗作用非常重要。


被动语态:
Endosmosis was observed in the experiment. = 在实验中观察到内渗作用。
The cell's volume is affected by endosmosis. = 细胞的体积受内渗作用影响。


疑问句:
Does endosmosis play a role in this process? = 内渗作用在这个过程中起作用吗？
What factors affect the rate of endosmosis? = 哪些因素会影响内渗作用的速度？


否定句:
Endosmosis did not occur in the control group. = 对照组没有发生内渗作用。
There was no significant endosmosis observed. = 没有观察到明显的内渗作用。
