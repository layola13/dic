词源:

The word "outgunning" is a combination of "out-" (meaning "to a greater extent than") and "gunning" (the act of firing guns or using weaponry).  The "-ing" suffix indicates a present participle, often used to form continuous tenses or gerunds.  The core meaning originates from the use of guns and firepower, but the term's application has expanded to include any situation of superior weaponry or force.
