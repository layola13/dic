词源：
The word "chagrin" comes from the French word "chagrin," meaning "vexation," "annoyance," or "grief."  It ultimately derives from the Old French "chagris," of uncertain origin, possibly related to a word meaning "rough" or "hairy," suggesting a feeling of irritation or unease.  The word entered English in the 17th century.
