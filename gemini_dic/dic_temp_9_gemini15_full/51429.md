词源:
The word "detestable" comes from the Old French word "detestable," which itself comes from the Latin word "detestabilis," meaning "worthy of being hated."  The prefix "de-" indicates "away from" or "completely," while "testabilis" is related to "testari," meaning "to bear witness" or "to testify," suggesting something that is so bad it evokes strong negative testimony.
