isosporic:/ˌaɪsoʊˈspɔːrɪk/ | adj. | 同孢子的；等孢子的 | Having spores of one kind only; uniform in spore production.  The term describes organisms that produce spores of a single type, all similar in size, shape, and function.  This is in contrast to heterosporic organisms which produce spores of two different sizes and types (megaspores and microspores). | Example:  Many ferns are isosporic, producing only one type of spore.  许多蕨类植物是等孢子的，只产生一种孢子。 | 近义词：homosporous | 反义词：heterosporic

The isosporic nature of the plant was determined by spore analysis. = 植物的等孢子性质是通过孢子分析确定的。


疑问句:
Is this species of fern isosporic or heterosporic? = 这种蕨类植物是等孢子还是异孢子？
Are all the spores in this sample isosporic? = 这个样本中的所有孢子都是等孢子吗？


否定句:
The plant is not isosporic; it produces two distinct types of spores. = 这种植物不是等孢子的；它产生两种不同类型的孢子。
