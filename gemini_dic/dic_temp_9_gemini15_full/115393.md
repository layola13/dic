manslaughterous: /ˈmænˌslɔːtərəs/ | adj. | 类似于非故意杀人的；与非故意杀人有关的 |  This word is not a standard English word. It's a non-standard or nonce word, formed by adding the suffix "-ous" (meaning "full of" or "characterized by") to "manslaughter."  While understandable based on its parts, it lacks established usage and is not found in standard dictionaries.  It would be inappropriate to use it in formal writing or conversation.  Instead, one should use more precise and established vocabulary to describe the relevant concept. |  *There is no example sentence as the word is not in common use.* |  近义词: murderous (if implying intent to kill, though manslaughter lacks this intent), culpable, criminal | 反义词: innocent, blameless
