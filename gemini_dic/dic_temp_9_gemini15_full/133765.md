The word "nongassier" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries or word databases. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a specific dialect or jargon.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered this term.
