The word "pubes's" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a misspelling or a non-standard usage.  A likely intended word is "pubes," which itself is a rarely used and somewhat informal term. Therefore, a detailed analysis in the requested format is not possible.  The correct word to use would depend on context.  If the intended meaning involves pubic hair, more appropriate and less informal terms should be used.
