hulotheism:/ˈhuːləθiːɪzəm/| n. |胡洛西斯教(一种古代宗教)|Hulotheism is a term used to describe a purported ancient religion, details of which are scarce and often debated by scholars.  It's often associated with pre-Greek or pre-Indo-European religious practices in the Aegean region, focusing on a deity or deities associated with the sun, sky, and perhaps the sea.  The evidence for its existence is primarily circumstantial, based on interpretations of archaeological finds and limited textual references.  There is no definitive agreement on what exactly constituted Hulotheism or even if it existed as a coherent religious system. |There is no widely accepted example sentence as the existence and nature of Hulotheism are debated.  Any sentence would be speculative.  |近义词:  (None readily available due to the debated nature of the term) |反义词: (None readily available due to the debated nature of the term)|名词
