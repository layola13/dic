词源:
The word "shrug" comes from the Middle English word "shruggen," which ultimately derives from Old Norse "hrjúga," meaning "to wrinkle or rumple."  The meaning evolved from a physical wrinkling or rumpling of the shoulders to the gesture of raising and lowering them to express a particular emotion or attitude.
