The word "eviller" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., following the requested format.  It might be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a fictional language.  If you could provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more helpful response.
