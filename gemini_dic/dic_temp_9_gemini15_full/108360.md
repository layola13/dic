词源:
The word "lavish" ultimately derives from the Old French word "laviss," meaning "to wash" or "to cleanse." This connection is somewhat obscure, but it's believed to have evolved through a sense of abundance or copiousness, as in washing something with an abundance of water.  Over time, the word shifted in meaning to describe something abundant and extravagant, leading to its current use.
