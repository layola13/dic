词源:

The word "churlishnesses" is derived from the adjective "churlish," which ultimately traces back to the Old English word "ceorl," meaning "freeman," "commoner," or "peasant."  Over time, "ceorl" took on connotations of rudeness and boorishness associated with the lower classes.  The suffix "-ish" was added to create the adjective "churlish," and the suffix "-ness" was added to create the noun "churlishness," with the final "-es" indicating the plural form.
