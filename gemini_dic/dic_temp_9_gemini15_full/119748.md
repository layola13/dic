词源:

The word "midwifing" comes directly from "midwife,"  which has Old English roots.  "Midwife" combines "mid" (meaning "with") and "wif" (meaning "woman").  Originally, it referred solely to women assisting in childbirth. The modern usage extends this to include the assistance in the development or birth of other things, such as ideas, projects, or initiatives.
