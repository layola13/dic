词源:
The word "railroading" originates from the act of working on or with railroads. The sense of "forcing something through quickly and without proper consideration" developed later, likely from the image of a powerful locomotive relentlessly moving forward, regardless of obstacles. The figurative use reflects the unstoppable nature of a train, implying a similar forcefulness in pushing through a decision or process.
