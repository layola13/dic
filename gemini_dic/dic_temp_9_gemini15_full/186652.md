词源:
The word "rigamarole" is believed to have originated in the 18th century.  Its etymology is uncertain, but it's likely a blend of various sources, possibly including "rig," meaning "to equip" or "to manipulate," and a suggestion of a repetitive or nonsensical element from a word like "marole."  The evolution of its meaning reflects the word's connection to long, complex, and often pointless processes or speeches.
