词源:

The word "loach" comes from the Middle English word *loche*, which in turn derives from Old English *lōce*.  The etymology is ultimately uncertain, but may be related to Proto-Germanic roots suggestive of  "something that leaps or jumps," though this connection is not definitively established.  The word's evolution reflects a long history of the fish being known and named in Germanic languages.
