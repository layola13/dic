The word "rindiest" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), slang, or dialectal term.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we would need more context about where you encountered this word.  Was it in a specific book, article, conversation, or other source?  Knowing the source might help determine its intended meaning and possible origin.
