英文解析：A desinence is a morpheme that is added to the end of a word stem to express grammatical relations such as tense, number, person, gender, case, or mood.  It's a significant part of morphology, the study of word formation.  Desinences are often suffixes, but can also be changes in the stem itself (such as vowel changes or consonant shifts) in some languages.


例句：

The "-ed" in "walked" is a desinence indicating past tense.  "walked"中的“-ed”是一个表示过去时的词尾。

The "-s" in "cats" is a desinence indicating plural number. "cats"中的“-s”是一个表示复数的词尾。
