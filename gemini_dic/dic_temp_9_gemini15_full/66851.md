词源:
The word "expectancy" comes from the Middle English word "expectance,"  derived from the Old French word "expectance," and ultimately from the Latin word "expectans," the present participle of "expectare," meaning "to await," "to look forward to," or "to wait for." The suffix "-ancy" indicates a state or quality.
