词源:
The word "mystified" comes from the verb "mystify," which itself derives from the noun "mystery."  The suffix "-fy" means "to make," so "mystify" means "to make mysterious" or "to puzzle."  The ultimate origin lies in the Old French word "mistere," meaning "mystery," which in turn comes from the Latin "ministerium," meaning "service," "office," or "mystery" in a religious context.  The shift in meaning from "service" to "mystery" reflects the association of mysteries with religious rites and secrets.
