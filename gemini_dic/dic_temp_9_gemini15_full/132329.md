/ˌnɒnˌdɪˈflɛkʃənz/ | n. | 不偏转，不挠度 | The absence of deflection or bending; a state of remaining straight or unbent.  It often refers to a structural element maintaining its shape under load. | Example: The bridge showed remarkable nondeflections under the extreme weight. 这座桥在极大的重量下表现出显著的不挠度。 | 近义词: straightness, rigidity, inflexibility | 反义词: deflection, bending, flexure


USAGE->

This word, "nondeflections," is a noun and doesn't typically conjugate like verbs.  Therefore, standard tense conjugation examples are not applicable.  Instead, we will show examples of how it's used in different sentence structures:


Simple Sentence:
The beam exhibited minimal nondeflections during the test. = 梁在测试期间表现出最小的不挠度。

Compound Sentence:
The building's design ensured nondeflections, and this prevented structural failure. = 建筑物的設計確保了不撓度，這也防止了結構性故障。


Complex Sentence:
Because of the reinforced steel, the significant nondeflections were observed even under high pressure. = 由于使用了钢筋加固，即使在高压下也观察到了显著的不挠度。


PHRASE->

Nondeflections are rarely used in common phrases.  It is primarily a technical term.  Instead of phrases, here are examples of usage in specific contexts:


Technical Report:  "The nondeflections measured were within the acceptable tolerance." = 测得的不挠度在可接受的公差范围内。

Engineering Specification: "Maximum allowable deflection: 1mm; therefore, ensuring sufficient nondeflections is paramount." = 最大允许挠度：1毫米；因此，确保足够的无挠度至关重要。

Scientific Paper: "The material's high tensile strength contributed to its remarkable nondeflections under stress." = 材料的高抗拉强度有助于其在应力作用下表现出显著的不挠度。

Analysis Report: "The analysis showed negligible nondeflections, indicating structural integrity." = 分析显示不挠度可忽略不计，表明结构完整。

Quality Control: "The component passed the nondeflections test, meeting the specified requirements." = 该部件通过了不挠度测试，满足规定的要求。
