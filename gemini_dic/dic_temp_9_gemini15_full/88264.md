The word "hink" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  There is no established pronunciation, meaning, etymology, or usage.  Therefore, I cannot provide a response following your requested format.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling:  Could you be thinking of a similar-sounding word?  Please double-check the spelling.
* It's a dialect word:  It might be a regional term or slang not widely known.  If you encountered it in a specific context (book, conversation, etc.), providing that context would be helpful.
* It's a newly coined word:  It could be a very recent invention or neologism.

Please provide more information or correct the spelling so I can assist you.
