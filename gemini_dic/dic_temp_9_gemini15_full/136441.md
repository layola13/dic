词源：

* **non-:**  prefix meaning "not"
* **reverence:** noun meaning "a feeling or attitude of deep respect tinged with awe; veneration."  It comes from Old French *reverence* and ultimately from Latin *reverentia* ("respect, awe").


用法说明：

Nonreverence is primarily used as an adjective to describe a lack of respect or veneration, often towards something considered sacred or important.  It is a relatively formal word and is not frequently used in everyday conversation.  It implies a deliberate disregard or contempt, rather than simple politeness.
