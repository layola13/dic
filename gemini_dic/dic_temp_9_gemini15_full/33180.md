chromogen:/ˈkroʊmədʒən/ | n. |显色剂，生色团 | A substance that produces color, especially when it reacts with another substance.  A chromogen is often used in staining techniques in microscopy and histology to visualize specific structures or cells. | Example:  The Gram stain uses crystal violet as a chromogen to differentiate between Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.  革兰氏染色法使用结晶紫作为显色剂来区分革兰氏阳性菌和革兰氏阴性菌。 |近义词：dye, stain, pigment |反义词：None specifically, but could be considered opposite to a "colorless substance" or a "decolorizer".

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The chromogen reacts with the cells. = 显色剂与细胞发生反应。
This dye acts as a chromogen. = 这种染料充当显色剂。

一般过去时:
The chromogen stained the tissue. = 显色剂将组织染色。
The scientist added the chromogen to the solution. = 科学家将显色剂添加到溶液中。

现在完成时:
The chromogen has produced a vibrant color. = 显色剂产生了鲜艳的颜色。
We have used this chromogen in many experiments. = 我们在许多实验中都使用了这种显色剂。

过去完成时:
The chromogen had already reacted before the observation. = 在观察之前，显色剂已经反应了。
They had selected the chromogen based on its properties. = 他们根据显色剂的特性选择了它。

将来时:
The chromogen will reveal the cell structure. = 显色剂将显示细胞结构。
We will use a different chromogen next time. = 我们下次将使用不同的显色剂。

虚拟语气:
If we used a stronger chromogen, we would see better results. = 如果我们使用更强的显色剂，我们将看到更好的结果。
I wish the chromogen had produced a clearer image. = 我希望显色剂能产生更清晰的图像。

被动语态:
The cells were stained by the chromogen. = 细胞被显色剂染色。
The chromogen was carefully applied to the sample. = 显色剂被小心地涂抹到样品上。

疑问句:
What chromogen are you using for this experiment? = 你在这个实验中使用什么显色剂？
Which chromogen is best suited for this application? = 哪个显色剂最适合这个应用？

否定句:
The chromogen did not react as expected. = 显色剂没有按预期反应。
We did not have the correct chromogen for the staining. = 我们没有用于染色的正确显色剂。


PHRASE->
chromogen group = 生色团
chromogen molecule = 显色剂分子
chromogen staining = 显色剂染色
chromogen precursor = 显色剂前体
chromogen solution = 显色剂溶液

词源:
From "chromo-" (color) + "-gen" (producing).  Therefore, it literally means "color-producing".
