hyperfunctions:/ˈhaɪpərˌfʌŋkʃənz/| n. |超函数|Hyperfunctions are a generalization of distributions that are particularly useful in the study of partial differential equations and complex analysis.  They extend the concept of functions to include objects that are not functions in the traditional sense, allowing for the representation of highly singular objects. Unlike distributions, hyperfunctions are defined on the boundary of an open set rather than within the set itself. This approach allows for a more natural treatment of boundary value problems.  They are often used to solve problems that are intractable using classical function theory. |Example:  The study of hyperfunctions provides a powerful framework for solving boundary value problems in partial differential equations.  研究超函数为求解偏微分方程中的边值问题提供了一个强大的框架。|近义词：distributions (in some contexts), generalized functions|反义词：N/A (no direct antonym)|词性:名词
