词源:

The word "disprovable" is formed from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of"), the verb "prove" (meaning "to establish the truth or validity of"), and the suffix "-able" (meaning "capable of").  Therefore, "disprovable" literally means "capable of not being proven true" or "capable of being proven false."  The root "prove" traces back to Old French "prover" and ultimately to Latin "probare" (to test, to try).
