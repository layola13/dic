词源:
The word "harassment" comes from the Old French word "harassement," meaning "to weary, to fatigue, to harass." This, in turn, derives from the verb "harasser," which has roots in the Old French "haras," meaning "a stud farm" (possibly implying the relentless work involved).  The modern meaning evolved to encompass the persistent, often aggressive, annoying, and distressing actions that constitute harassment today.
