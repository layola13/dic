The word "comelily" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or archaic dialect.  To provide the requested analysis, I need a valid English word.
