词源:

The word "frolicking" comes from the Middle English word "frolic," which itself has uncertain origins.  Some etymologists suggest a possible connection to Old French words related to "frollic" or "frivolous," implying a lighthearted and playful nature. The "-ing" suffix transforms the verb "frolic" into a present participle, acting as an adjective or a gerund.
