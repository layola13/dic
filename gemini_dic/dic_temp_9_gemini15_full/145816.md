overdeepening:/ˌoʊvərˈdiːpənɪŋ/ | n. | 超深挖掘，过度深挖 | The excessive deepening of a channel, valley, or other geological feature beyond the level expected from normal processes.  This often results from glacial activity or other erosional forces. | Example: The overdeepening of the valley floor created a deep, U-shaped profile.  超深挖掘的山谷底部形成了一个深U形的剖面。 |近义词：excessive deepening, profound erosion |反义词：shallowing, minimal erosion |

否定句:
The valley was not significantly overdeepened. = 山谷没有被显著地过度深挖。
