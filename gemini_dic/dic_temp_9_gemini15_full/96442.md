词源：

The word "indistinguishing" is formed from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the verb "distinguish," which comes from the Latin word "distinguere," meaning "to mark off," "to separate," or "to discern."  Therefore, "indistinguishing" literally means "not able to be distinguished."


用法说明：

"Indistinguishing" is primarily used as an adjective to describe something that is difficult or impossible to distinguish from something else. It often highlights a lack of clear differences or unique characteristics.  The things being compared might be similar in appearance, sound, function, or other qualities.  Note that while similar to "indistinguishable," "indistinguishing" focuses more on the inherent lack of distinction within the object itself rather than solely on the inability to distinguish between two separate objects.
