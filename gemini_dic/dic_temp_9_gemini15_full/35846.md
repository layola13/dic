词源:  Derived from "Cockney," referring to a native of the East End of London, particularly those born within earshot of the Bow Bells (the bells of St. Mary-le-Bow church). The term originally carried neutral connotations, but over time, it became associated with a particular dialect and working-class culture, which then influenced the adjective "cockneyish."  The "-ish" suffix adds a sense of resemblance or approximation.
