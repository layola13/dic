nitrify:/ˈnaɪtrɪfaɪ/| v.|硝化；使变成硝酸盐|To convert (ammonia or ammonium salts) into nitrates.  This process is crucial in the nitrogen cycle, converting ammonia, a form of nitrogen that is toxic to plants, into nitrates, a form of nitrogen that plants can use. |例句：Bacteria in the soil nitrify ammonia, making it available to plants. 土壤中的细菌将氨转化为硝酸盐，使植物能够吸收利用。|例句：The process of nitrification is essential for healthy plant growth. 硝化过程对于植物的健康生长至关重要。|近义词：oxidize (in this context)|反义词：denitrify
