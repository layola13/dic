词源:

The word "enduringness" is derived from the verb "endure," which comes from the Old French word "endurer" and ultimately from the Latin word "indurare," meaning "to harden."  The suffix "-ness" is added to create a noun, indicating a quality or state.  Therefore, "enduringness" literally refers to the quality or state of being able to endure or last.


用法说明:

Enduringness is typically used to describe the ability of something to withstand the passage of time, pressure, or hardship. It can refer to physical objects (like a building's enduringness), abstract concepts (like the enduringness of a belief), or even relationships (like the enduringness of a marriage).  The word implies strength, resilience, and longevity.  It focuses on the capacity to persist despite challenges.
