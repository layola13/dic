racemic:/reɪˈsiːmɪk/| adj.|外消旋的；消旋的|Containing equal amounts of both enantiomers of a chiral molecule, resulting in a mixture that does not rotate polarized light.|The drug is available as a racemic mixture.|近义词：racemate|反义词：enantiopure, optically active


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The solution is racemic. = 溶液是外消旋的。
This mixture contains a racemic compound. = 这种混合物含有外消旋化合物。


一般过去时:
The chemist prepared a racemic mixture. = 化学家制备了一种外消旋混合物。
The reaction produced a racemic product. = 该反应产生了外消旋产物。


现在完成时:
Scientists have synthesized many racemic drugs. = 科学家们已经合成了许多外消旋药物。
They have found that the compound is racemic. = 他们发现该化合物是外消旋的。


过去完成时:
Researchers had already determined that the sample was racemic. = 研究人员早已确定该样品是外消旋的。
Before the analysis, they had suspected the mixture was racemic. = 在分析之前，他们怀疑该混合物是外消旋的。


将来时:
We will obtain a racemic mixture after the reaction. = 反应后我们将得到外消旋混合物。
The experiment will likely yield a racemic product. = 实验很可能会产生外消旋产物。


虚拟语气:
If the reaction proceeded without stereoselectivity, it would produce a racemic mixture. = 如果反应没有立体选择性地进行，它将产生外消旋混合物。
It would be beneficial if we could separate the enantiomers from the racemic mixture. = 如果我们能够从外消旋混合物中分离出对映异构体，那将是有益的。


被动语态:
A racemic mixture was produced in the experiment. = 在实验中产生了外消旋混合物。
The racemic compound was characterized by its optical inactivity. = 外消旋化合物以其旋光性不活跃为特征。


疑问句:
Is the final product racemic? = 最终产物是外消旋的吗？
Is this mixture optically active or racemic? = 这种混合物是旋光活性的还是外消旋的？


否定句:
The product is not racemic; it is enantiomerically pure. = 产物不是外消旋的；它是对映体纯的。
The reaction did not produce a racemic mixture. = 该反应没有产生外消旋混合物。


PHRASE->
racemic mixture = 外消旋混合物
racemic modification = 外消旋体
racemic compound = 外消旋化合物
resolution of racemic mixture = 外消旋混合物的拆分
