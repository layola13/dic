词源:

The word "preascertained" is a combination of:

* **pre-**:  A prefix meaning "before" or "in advance."
* **ascertain**: A verb meaning "to find (something) out for certain; make sure of."  This comes from Old French *aseortir (to adjust, arrange) from *a- (to) + *seortir (to sort out, distinguish), from Latin *ex- (out) + *sortiri (to draw lots, choose).

Therefore, "preascertained" literally means "determined beforehand."
