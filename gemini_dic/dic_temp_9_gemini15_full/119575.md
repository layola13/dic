microvolt:/ˈmaɪkroʊvoʊlt/ | n. | 微伏 | A microvolt is one millionth of a volt, a unit of electromotive force.  It's a very small unit of electrical potential difference. | Example: The sensor detected a signal of only a few microvolts. 传感器检测到只有几微伏的信号。 |近义词:  (There aren't direct synonyms as it's a specific unit of measurement, but related units could be mentioned like millivolt) | 反义词: (Not applicable, as it's a unit of measurement, not a concept with an opposite) | 名词
