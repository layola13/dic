The word is a compound of "self" and "frictions".  "Self" is an old English word meaning "oneself," while "friction" derives from the Latin "frictionem" (a rubbing or chafing), ultimately from "fricare" (to rub).  Therefore, "self-frictions" literally means "rubbing or conflicts within oneself or a group."
