词源:

The word "disingenuity" is derived from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") and the word "ingenuity," which originally meant "native cleverness" or "ingenuousness."  Over time, "ingenuity" came to primarily mean "cleverness" or "inventiveness."  Thus, "disingenuity" signifies the opposite – a lack of genuine cleverness or a cleverness used deceptively.  The root is ultimately from the Latin "ingenium," meaning "natural talent" or "inborn quality."
