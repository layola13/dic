capillary-tube:/ˌkæpɪˈlɛri tuːb/| n. |毛细管|A capillary tube is a very thin, hollow tube with a small internal diameter, often used in scientific experiments and medical applications to demonstrate capillary action or to contain small amounts of liquid.  It's characterized by its narrow bore, which allows for the observation of surface tension effects and other phenomena related to fluid dynamics in confined spaces. |Example: The experiment used a capillary tube to measure the surface tension of the liquid.  实验使用毛细管来测量液体的表面张力。

The water rose in the capillary tube due to capillary action.  水由于毛细作用在毛细管中上升。|近义词：fine tube, narrow tube |反义词：wide tube, large bore tube

词源:
From "capillary," meaning "hair-like," referring to the narrowness of the tube, derived from Latin *capillaris, from capillus "hair."  "Tube" comes from Old French "tube," ultimately from Latin "tubus."
