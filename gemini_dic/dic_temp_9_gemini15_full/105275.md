The word "khoudarock" does not appear to be a word in standard English or any widely recognized dictionary.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (like a name or place), or a word from a niche vocabulary or dialect.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical explanation is impossible.  To provide the requested information, I need a correctly spelled word or more context about where you encountered this term.
