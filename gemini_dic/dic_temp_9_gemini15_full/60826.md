electroreduction:/ˌɪˌlɛktrəʊrɪˈdʌkʃən/| n. |电还原|The process of reducing a substance using electricity.  This typically involves applying a negative potential to an electrode in an electrochemical cell, causing electrons to be transferred to the substance, thereby reducing its oxidation state. |Example: The electroreduction of carbon dioxide to methane is a promising area of research in renewable energy. 电还原二氧化碳制甲烷是可再生能源领域一个很有前景的研究方向。|近义词:electrosynthesis,cathodic reduction|反义词:electrooxidation
