词源：

The word "exactness" derives from the adjective "exact," which comes from the Latin word "exactus," the past participle of "exigere," meaning "to demand," "to require," or "to drive out."  The sense of "exact" as meaning "precise" developed from the idea of something being precisely demanded or required.  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, indicating a quality or state.
