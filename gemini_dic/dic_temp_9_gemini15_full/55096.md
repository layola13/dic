The word "disrespective" is formed by adding the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") to the adjective "respective."  "Respective" originates from the Latin word "respectus," meaning "regard," "attention," or "consideration." Therefore, "disrespective" literally means "not showing respect."
