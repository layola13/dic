instantiation:/ˌɪnstænʃiˈeɪʃən/| n. |实例化，具体化，创建实例|The act of creating a specific instance of a class or template.  It involves allocating memory and assigning values to the object's attributes.  In simpler terms, it's the process of bringing an abstract concept into reality.|Example:  The instantiation of a new user object in a program requires allocating memory for its attributes like username and password.|近义词：creation, realization, embodiment|反义词：abstraction


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The program instantiates a new object every time a user logs in. = 程序每次用户登录时都会实例化一个新对象。
This factory method instantiates different types of objects based on user input. = 此工厂方法根据用户输入实例化不同类型的对象。


一般过去时:
The developer instantiated a database connection before querying the data. = 开发人员在查询数据之前实例化了一个数据库连接。
The system instantiated a new thread to handle the request. = 系统实例化了一个新线程来处理请求。


现在完成时:
The application has instantiated several worker threads to improve performance. = 该应用程序已实例化了多个工作线程以提高性能。
The framework has instantiated all the necessary components for the application to run. = 框架已实例化应用程序运行所需的所有组件。


过去完成时:
Before the function executed, it had instantiated all the required resources. = 在函数执行之前，它已实例化了所有必需的资源。
The process had instantiated multiple child processes before the error occurred. = 在错误发生之前，该进程已实例化了多个子进程。


将来时:
The next step will instantiate a new window to display the results. = 下一步将实例化一个新窗口来显示结果。
The system will automatically instantiate the necessary drivers when the device is connected. = 当设备连接时，系统将自动实例化必要的驱动程序。


虚拟语气:
If we instantiated a different object, the results might be different. = 如果我们实例化一个不同的对象，结果可能会不同。
It would be helpful if the program instantiated the object more efficiently. = 如果程序更有效地实例化对象，那将很有帮助。


被动语态:
A new object was instantiated by the constructor. = 一个新对象由构造函数实例化。
The required resources were instantiated before the program started. = 程序启动前实例化了所需的资源。


疑问句:
How many objects are instantiated during the program's execution? = 在程序执行期间实例化了多少个对象？
Where is the object instantiated in the code? = 对象在代码中的哪个位置实例化？


否定句:
The program did not instantiate the object correctly. = 程序没有正确实例化对象。
The system failed to instantiate the necessary drivers. = 系统未能实例化必要的驱动程序。


PHRASE->
class instantiation = 类实例化
object instantiation = 对象实例化
template instantiation = 模板实例化
generic instantiation = 泛型实例化
lazy instantiation = 延迟实例化
