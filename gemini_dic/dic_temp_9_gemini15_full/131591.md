词源:

The word "noncompetition" is a compound word formed from "non-" (meaning "not") and "competition."  "Competition" derives from the Latin word "concurrere," meaning "to run together." The prefix "com-" indicates "together," and "currere" means "to run."  Thus, "competition" originally referred to a running together, or a striving together, for something.  The addition of "non-" creates the antonym, indicating the absence of such striving.
