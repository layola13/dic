USAGE->
This word is unusual and rarely used.  It's generally better to use more specific terms like "electrical phenomena," "electric power," or types of electricity (e.g., "currents," "voltages").  Therefore, providing example sentences for various tenses would be artificial and unnatural. The word itself doesn't lend itself to typical grammatical constructions in the same way that common nouns do.


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "electricities".  The word is too uncommon for established phrasal use.
