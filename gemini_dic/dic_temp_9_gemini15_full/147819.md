词源:
The word "overprovokes" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or to a greater degree than is necessary) and the verb "provokes" (meaning to stimulate or excite).  The root of "provoke" comes from the Old French "provoquer" and ultimately from the Latin "provocāre," meaning "to call forth."
