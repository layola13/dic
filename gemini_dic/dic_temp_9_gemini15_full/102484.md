词源:
The word "jackstraws" is believed to derive from the obsolete word "jacks," which referred to small objects used in games, combined with "straws," referring to the slender sticks used in the game.  The exact origin of the "jacks" portion is uncertain but may be related to a similar game played with knucklebones.
