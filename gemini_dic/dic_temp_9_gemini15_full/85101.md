词源:
The term "hardcore" originated in the 1970s, initially within the punk rock subculture to describe music that was aggressive, uncompromising, and intense.  Later, it expanded its usage to other contexts, including pornography and other areas where intensity and dedication are prominent.  It combines "hard" (meaning difficult, strong, or extreme) and "core" (meaning central or essential).
