The word "nonsurfaces" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word, or a misspelling.  Therefore, a complete analysis following your requested format is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need to understand the intended meaning or context in which this word was used.  Was it meant to be a combination of words, a misspelling, or a technical term within a specific field?

If you can provide more context (e.g., the sentence it appeared in, the subject matter), I can attempt to offer a possible interpretation and a breakdown based on that.
