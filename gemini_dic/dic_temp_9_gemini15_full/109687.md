leucoxene:/ˈluːkɒksiːn/| n. |钛铁矿的次生矿物|A titanium-rich secondary mineral formed by the alteration of other titanium minerals, such as ilmenite.  It's typically composed of titanium dioxide (TiO2) and often contains other elements like iron and vanadium.  Leucoxene is usually found as an alteration product in various igneous and metamorphic rocks.|The beach sands contained significant amounts of leucoxene, indicating past titanium-rich mineral deposits.|近义词：pseudobrookite, rutile (in some contexts)|反义词：无


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in geology and mineralogy, so there aren't common usages in everyday speech like "what".  Therefore, standard grammatical tense examples are not applicable.  Instead, here are examples showing its usage within geological contexts:

一般现在时:
Leucoxene is a common alteration product of ilmenite. = 白钛矿是钛铁矿的常见蚀变产物。
Leucoxene occurs in various geological settings. = 白钛矿存在于各种地质环境中。


一般过去时:
The researchers identified leucoxene in the rock samples. = 研究人员在岩石样品中发现了白钛矿。
Geologists studied the formation of leucoxene from ilmenite. = 地质学家研究了白钛矿由钛铁矿形成的过程。


现在完成时:
Scientists have found leucoxene in many different locations. = 科学家们在许多不同的地方发现了白钛矿。
The analysis has shown a significant amount of leucoxene present. = 分析表明存在大量的白钛矿。


过去完成时:
Before the alteration, the primary mineral was ilmenite, which later transformed into leucoxene. = 在蚀变之前，主要矿物是钛铁矿，后来转变为白钛矿。
They had already identified leucoxene before beginning the detailed analysis. = 他们在开始详细分析之前就已经识别出白钛矿了。


将来时:
Future research will investigate the precise conditions for leucoxene formation. = 未来的研究将调查白钛矿形成的精确条件。
We will analyze the sample for the presence of leucoxene. = 我们将分析样品中是否存在白钛矿。
