/ˌpriːpɑːrˌtɪsɪˈpeɪʃənz/ | n. | 预先参与；事前准备 |  The word "preparticipations" is not a standard English word. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before) and "participations" (the act of participating).  Therefore, there's no established definition, usage, or etymology in standard dictionaries.  Its meaning would depend entirely on the context in which it's used.  One could infer that it refers to actions taken *before* participating in something, preparatory activities, or perhaps even the act of being involved in the planning stages before an event. |  Example:  "The preparticipations involved extensive research and logistical planning." (This sentence demonstrates a possible, but invented, usage.) |  近义词: preparations, preliminary activities, advance planning | 反义词: post-participation, aftermath, follow-up  | n.
