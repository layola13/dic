magmata:/ˈmæɡmətɑː/| n. |岩浆；熔岩 | Molten rock beneath the Earth's surface.  Magma is a complex mixture of molten rock, crystals, and dissolved gases. When magma reaches the Earth's surface, it is called lava. | 例句：The volcano erupted, spewing forth rivers of incandescent magma. 火山爆发，喷出炽热的岩浆。

The movement of magma beneath the Earth's crust causes earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. 地球地壳下岩浆的运动引起地震和火山爆发。|近义词：lava (when on the surface), molten rock |反义词：solid rock

USAGE->
一般现在时:
Magma flows beneath the Earth's surface. = 岩浆在地球表面以下流动。
The magma contains various minerals. = 岩浆含有各种矿物。

一般过去时:
Magma erupted from the volcano. = 岩浆从火山喷发出来。
The scientists studied the solidified magma. = 科学家们研究了凝固的岩浆。

现在完成时:
Volcanic eruptions have released vast amounts of magma over millions of years. = 数百万年来，火山喷发释放了大量的岩浆。
Geologists have mapped the underground magma chambers. = 地质学家已经绘制了地下岩浆室的地图。

过去完成时:
The pressure had built up in the magma chamber before the eruption. = 喷发前，岩浆室内的压力已经积聚起来。
Scientists had already predicted the magma flow. = 科学家们已经预测了岩浆的流动。

将来时:
Geologists predict that the magma will rise again. = 地质学家预测岩浆还会再次上升。
The volcano may erupt if the magma pressure increases. = 如果岩浆压力增加，火山可能会爆发。

虚拟语气:
If the magma had been less viscous, the eruption would have been different. = 如果岩浆粘度较低，喷发将会不同。
