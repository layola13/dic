The term "reach-to" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a phrasal verb formed by combining "reach" and "to," but it lacks established dictionary definition or common usage.  Therefore, a full analysis like the example provided is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, we need to understand the intended meaning within a specific context.  Is it meant to convey:

* **An attempt to reach something/someone:**  In this case, "reach for" or "try to reach" would be more appropriate and grammatically correct.

* **A connection or extension to something:** Here, alternative phrasing like "extend to," "connect to," or "relate to" might better capture the intended meaning.

If you can provide the sentence or context where you encountered "reach-to," I can offer a more precise analysis and suggest suitable alternatives.
