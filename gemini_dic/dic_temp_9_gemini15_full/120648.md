词源:

* **mis-**:  A prefix meaning "wrongly," "badly," or "incorrectly."  This comes from Old English *mis-,*  meaning "wrong," "ill," or "badly."

* **sampled**: The past participle of the verb "to sample," meaning "to take a small part of something to represent the whole."  This ultimately derives from Old French *sampli, sample*, from Latin *exemplāre* ("to take as an example").
