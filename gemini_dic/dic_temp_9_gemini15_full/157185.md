词源:
The word "pinhead" is a compound word.  "Pin" refers to a small, slender piece of metal with a sharp point used for fastening things, and "head" refers to the top part of something.  Therefore, "pinhead" literally means the head of a pin. Its figurative meaning of a stupid person developed later, likely due to the small size and perceived insignificance of a pinhead.
