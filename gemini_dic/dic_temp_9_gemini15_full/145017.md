The word "overadvancing" is a combination of the prefix "over-" (meaning excessively or to a degree exceeding what is normal or desirable) and the verb "advancing" (meaning to move forward or make progress).  The root of "advance" comes from the Old French word "avancer," ultimately deriving from the Latin "ad" (to) and "vanzare" (to go).
