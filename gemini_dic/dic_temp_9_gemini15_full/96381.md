词源:

The word "indiscreetness" is derived from the adjective "indiscreet," which itself comes from the prefix "in-" (meaning "not") and the word "discreet."  "Discreet" originates from the Old French word "discret," meaning "separate, distinct, discerning."  The evolution reflects a shift from the original sense of "separate" to the modern understanding of careful and prudent behavior.
