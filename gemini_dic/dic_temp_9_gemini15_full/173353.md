The word "quasi-difficultly" does not exist in standard English.  It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, possibly formed by combining "quasi" and "difficulty."  Therefore, a full lexical entry as requested is impossible. However, we can analyze the potential meaning and structure of this non-existent word.


/ˈkwɑːzaɪ ˈdɪfɪkəlti/ | adj. n. |  准困难；似是而非的困难 |  The word combines "quasi," meaning "seemingly," "apparently," or "to a certain extent," with "difficulty."  It suggests a situation or problem that presents some, but not all, of the characteristics of a true difficulty. It might be a minor obstacle, a perceived difficulty, or a difficulty that is easily overcome.  The word's grammatical function would depend on context; it could function as an adjective modifying a noun or as a noun itself.


Example (hypothetical):

"He experienced quasi-difficulty in solving the equation, finding it more time-consuming than challenging." = 他在解这个方程式时遇到了些许困难，发现它更费时而不是具有挑战性。


Near Synonyms (depending on context):

minor setback, slight challenge, apparent problem, perceived difficulty, trivial obstacle


Antonyms (depending on context):

ease, simplicity, straightforwardness


Word Class:  Potentially adjective or noun.

Because "quasi-difficultly" is not a real word, providing grammatical examples in various tenses and moods is meaningless.  The same is true for phrases.  The analysis above is based on a hypothetical understanding of the word’s intended meaning.
