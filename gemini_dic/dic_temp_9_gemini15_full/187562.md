词源:

The word "romantic" ultimately derives from the French word "romantique," which itself originated from the Italian word "romanzesco."  These words, in turn, are related to the Old French word "roman," meaning "romance" (a medieval narrative in verse or prose, often dealing with chivalric love and adventure).  The evolution reflects a shift in meaning from the narrative form itself to the qualities associated with those narratives – namely, idealized love, adventure, and often a sense of idealism.
