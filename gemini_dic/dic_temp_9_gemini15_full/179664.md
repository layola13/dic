词源:
The word "reenjoining" is formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") to the present participle "enjoining," which itself is derived from the verb "enjoin" (meaning "to order; to command; to urge").  Therefore, "reenjoining" literally means "joining again."  The root is the Old French "enjoindre," from Latin "injungere," meaning "to join in."
