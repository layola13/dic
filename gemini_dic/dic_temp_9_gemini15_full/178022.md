词源:
The verb "reckon" comes from Old English *reccan, meaning "to think, care, or heed."  The "up" in "reckon up" is a particle that intensifies the meaning, indicating a complete or thorough calculation.  The sense of calculation evolved gradually from the broader meaning of "to think" or "to consider."
