词源:The word "linchpin" comes from the Old English words "linch" (meaning "a piece of wood" or "a bolt") and "pin."  Originally, a linchpin was a pin that went through the end of an axle to keep a wheel on a carriage.  The metaphorical use of the word to describe something essential derives from this original meaning.  The wheel would be useless, and the carriage unable to function, without the linchpin.
