词源:

The word "disclose" comes from the Old French word "desclos," meaning "unclosed, open."  The prefix "dis-" means "apart" or "away," and the root "-close" is related to the Latin word "claudere," meaning "to close" or "to shut."  Therefore, "disclose" literally means "to open apart" or "to reveal what was closed or hidden."
