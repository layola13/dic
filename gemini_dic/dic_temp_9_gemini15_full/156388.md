/ˈfɪzoʊklɪst/ | n. |生理学家|A physoclist is a type of fish whose swim bladder is closed and doesn't connect to the esophagus.  These fish regulate their buoyancy by secreting or absorbing gases into the swim bladder. | Example: Many deep-sea fish are physoclists, allowing them to maintain depth without constant swimming.  许多深海鱼是闭鳔鱼，这使它们能够保持深度而无需持续游泳。|近义词：暂无精确近义词，可根据语境用“closed-bladder fish”等替代 |反义词：physostome (open-bladder fish) |名词
