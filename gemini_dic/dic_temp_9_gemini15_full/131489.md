noncollapsability: /ˌnɒnkəlæpsəˈbɪləti/ | n. |不可坍缩性，不可崩溃性 | The inability to collapse or be compressed into a smaller volume.  This term is often used in physics and engineering contexts, particularly when discussing materials or structures that resist compression or maintain their shape under pressure. | Example: The noncollapsability of the structure ensured its stability during the earthquake.  结构的不可坍缩性确保了其在地震中的稳定性。The high noncollapsability of the neutron star is a fascinating aspect of astrophysics. 中子星的高不可坍缩性是天体物理学中一个引人入胜的方面。| 近义词:  incompressibility, rigidity, stability | 反义词: collapsibility, compressibility, fragility |  词性: 名词


USAGE->

This word is primarily used in scientific and technical writing, and therefore doesn't have typical grammatical usages in the same way as common words.  It functions as a noun, and its usage revolves around describing properties of materials or systems.

Example sentences demonstrating its use in different contexts:

Statement of fact: The bridge's remarkable noncollapsability was a testament to the engineers' skill. 桥梁非凡的不可坍缩性证明了工程师们的技能。

Comparison:  The noncollapsability of this foam is significantly higher than that of the previous model.  这种泡沫的不可坍缩性明显高于之前的型号。

Explanation: The material's unique molecular structure accounts for its high noncollapsability. 材料独特的分子结构使其具有高不可坍缩性。

PHRASE->

Phrases using "noncollapsability" are largely context-specific and depend heavily on the scientific field being discussed.  There aren't common, idiomatic phrases built around this word.  Instead, it typically forms part of longer descriptive phrases like:

* high degree of noncollapsability
* structural noncollapsability
* ensuring noncollapsability
* limits of noncollapsability
* testing for noncollapsability
