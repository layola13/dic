词源:
The word "marginalized" comes from the word "margin," meaning the edge or border of something.  The suffix "-alized" indicates the process of being made marginal or placed at the margin.  Therefore, "marginalized" describes the process of being pushed to the edges of society or a particular system, resulting in exclusion and lack of power.
