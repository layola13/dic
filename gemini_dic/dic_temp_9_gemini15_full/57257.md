词源:
The word "download" is a compound word formed from "down" and "load."  "Load" has its roots in Old English "hlǣdan," meaning "to lead, carry, or guide."  The prefix "down" indicates movement downwards, reflecting the transfer of data from a remote source to a local device.  The verb form evolved in the context of computer technology, gaining widespread usage with the proliferation of the internet and digital file sharing.
