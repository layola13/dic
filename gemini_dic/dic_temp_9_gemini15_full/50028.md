词源:

The word "denominator" comes from the Late Latin word *denominatōr, meaning "one who names," or "one that gives a name."  This in turn is derived from the Latin verb *denomināre, meaning "to name," "to call by name," or "to give a name to."  The mathematical meaning evolved from the idea that the denominator "names" or specifies the kind of fraction (e.g., halves, thirds, fourths).
