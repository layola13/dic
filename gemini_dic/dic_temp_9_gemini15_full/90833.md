词源:

The word "hundred" ultimately derives from the Proto-Germanic word *hund, meaning "hundred". This reflects the common Germanic system of counting where "hundred" was based on the number 120 rather than 100. The Old English form was *hund, which evolved into the Middle English "hundred".  The modern English spelling and pronunciation are consistent with this historical evolution.  The connection to the number 120 is seen in the older Germanic languages, where the word for "hundred" sometimes referred to a larger grouping.
