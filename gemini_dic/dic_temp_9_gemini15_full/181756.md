词源:  The word "reliever" derives from the verb "relieve," which comes from the Old French "relevier," meaning "to raise up, lift up."  This further traces back to the Latin "relevare," composed of "re-" (again) and "levare" (to lift, raise).  The sense of "to relieve" evolved from the physical act of lifting a burden to the metaphorical sense of easing a burden, whether physical or emotional.
