词源:
The word "career" originates from the Old French word "cariere," which meant "race course" or "road."  The modern meaning evolved from the idea of a path or course one takes through life, particularly in their profession.  The shift in meaning reflects the increasingly structured and planned approach to professional life that developed over time.
