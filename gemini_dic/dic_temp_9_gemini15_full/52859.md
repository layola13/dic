* **di-**:  A prefix meaning "two".  Derived from Greek.
* **methyl**:  Referring to the methyl group (CH3). Derived from "methane" (CH4) and "-yl" which is a suffix indicating a hydrocarbon radical.  "Methane" itself comes from "meth-" (from wood alcohol, methanol) and "-ane" (a suffix for alkanes).


USAGE->
(Dimethyl itself doesn't function as a verb or noun in the same way as a typical word.  Its usage is primarily as a prefix in chemical nomenclature.  Therefore, typical grammatical tenses and voices are not applicable.)
