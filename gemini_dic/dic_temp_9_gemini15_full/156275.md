phyllodium:/faɪˈloʊdiəm/| n. |叶状柄|A flattened leaf-like petiole (the stalk of a leaf) that functions like a leaf blade in photosynthesis.  It is a modified petiole that resembles a leaf blade in shape and function.  Phyllodia are common in some acacia species, especially those adapted to arid or semi-arid environments. They reduce water loss by having a smaller surface area than a true leaf.|Example:  The acacia tree displayed numerous phyllodia, its modified petioles performing the role of leaves.|近义词：leaf (in function), modified petiole|反义词：None specifically, but the opposite would be a normal, non-modified petiole and leaf blade.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The acacia shows phyllodia. = 这种金合欢显示出叶状柄。
Phyllodia perform photosynthesis. = 叶状柄进行光合作用。

一般过去时:

疑问句:
Are these structures phyllodia or true leaves? = 这些结构是叶状柄还是真叶？
What is the evolutionary advantage of phyllodia? = 叶状柄的进化优势是什么？

否定句:
The plant does not have typical leaves, only phyllodia. = 这种植物没有典型的叶子，只有叶状柄。
This species does not develop phyllodia. = 这个物种不发育叶状柄。
