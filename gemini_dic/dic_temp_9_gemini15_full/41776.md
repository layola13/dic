词源:

From corrupt + -ness.  "Corrupt" ultimately derives from the Latin word "corruptus," the past participle of "corrumpere," meaning "to break, destroy, or ruin." This further breaks down into "cor-" (intensive prefix) and "rumpere" (to break).  Therefore, the original sense hinted at a breaking or destruction of something's integrity.
