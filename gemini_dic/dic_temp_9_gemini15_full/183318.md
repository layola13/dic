反义词：culpability, blameworthiness, guilt, reprehensibility


词源：reproach (v.) + -less (suffix) + -ness (suffix).  "Reproach" comes from Old French *reprochier, from Latin *repropinquare ("to draw near again"), from *prope ("near").  "-less" indicates the absence of something, and "-ness" forms nouns of quality or state.  Thus, "reproachlessness" means the state of being without reproach.
