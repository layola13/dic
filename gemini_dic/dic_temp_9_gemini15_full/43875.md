The word "cressy" is not a standard English word found in major dictionaries.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a regional dialect word, a proper noun (perhaps a name or place), or a newly coined term.  More context is needed to determine its meaning and usage.
