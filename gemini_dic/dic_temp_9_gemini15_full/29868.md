词源:
The word "cause" originates from the Old French word "cause," which in turn comes from the Latin word "causa," meaning "a thing that happens, a lawsuit, cause, reason."  The Latin word is related to the verb "cadere," meaning "to fall" or "to happen."  This connection suggests an original sense of something that "happens" or "falls" into place as a reason or origin of something else.
