词源:
The word "emissivity" is derived from the verb "emit," meaning "to send out," combined with the suffix "-ivity," which indicates a capacity or tendency.  Therefore, "emissivity" literally means "the capacity or tendency to emit."  The root "emit" traces back to the Latin verb *emittere, from *e- ("out") + *mittere ("to send").
