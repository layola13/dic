词源：The word "disconsolateness" is derived from the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of"), "con-" (meaning "together" or "with"), "sol" (meaning "alone" or "single"), and the suffix "-ness" (indicating a state or condition).  The root "sol" connects to the Latin word "solus," meaning "alone."  Therefore, disconsolateness literally signifies "the state of not being together with comfort or solace."  It suggests a feeling of being utterly alone and without comfort in one's sadness.
