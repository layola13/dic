The word "kusha" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a detailed analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* **A word from another language:**  It could be a word borrowed from another language. If you can provide the language of origin, I might be able to help.
* **A neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word or slang term not yet widely recognized.  More context is needed.


To provide the analysis you requested, I need a valid English word. Please provide the correct spelling or more information about the word's origin and context.
