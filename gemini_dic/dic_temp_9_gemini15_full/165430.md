The word "prelawfulness" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or common usage.  Therefore, a full analysis as requested is impossible.  The word appears to be a neologism (newly coined word) or a misspelling.  It might be intended to convey a meaning related to "pre-law" (studies before law school) or a concept of something existing *before* the establishment of law or legal order. However, without further context or intended meaning, a proper analysis cannot be provided.
