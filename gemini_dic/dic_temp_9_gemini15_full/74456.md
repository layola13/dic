词源:
From Old French franc, from Frankish *frank, from Proto-Germanic *frank-, meaning "free," "frank," "brave," "independent."  The adjective's meaning evolved from the sense of freedom of speech to denote honesty and openness. The name Frank is derived from the same root, historically referring to the Franks, a Germanic people.
