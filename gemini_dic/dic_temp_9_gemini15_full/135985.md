nonradioactive: /ˌnɒnˌreɪdiəʊˈæktɪv/ | adj. |非放射性的；不具放射性的 | Not emitting or exhibiting radioactivity.  Substances that are nonradioactive do not emit ionizing radiation. | Example:  The sample was confirmed to be nonradioactive after testing.  测试后确认样品是非放射性的。|近义词：inactive, inert |反义词：radioactive


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The substance is nonradioactive. =  该物质是非放射性的。
This material remains nonradioactive. =  这种材料仍然是非放射性的。

一般过去时:
The test showed the sample was nonradioactive. = 测试显示样品是非放射性的。
The reactor was shut down, and the core became nonradioactive. =反应堆关闭后，堆芯变得不具放射性。

现在完成时:
Scientists have confirmed that the waste is nonradioactive. = 科学家们已经证实该废物是非放射性的。
The area has remained nonradioactive since the accident. = 事故发生后，该地区一直保持非放射性状态。

过去完成时:
We had ensured that all materials were nonradioactive before starting the experiment. = 我们在开始实验之前已经确保所有材料都是非放射性的。
They had discovered that the source was nonradioactive, eliminating the radiation hazard. =他们发现该来源是非放射性的，消除了辐射危害。


将来时:
The waste will be nonradioactive after sufficient decay. = 充分衰变后，废物将变为非放射性。
The treated water will become nonradioactive. = 处理后的水将变成非放射性的。


虚拟语气:
If the material were nonradioactive, we wouldn't need protective gear. = 如果材料是非放射性的，我们就无需防护装备。
I wish the contaminated area were already nonradioactive. = 我希望受污染区域已经是非放射性的。


被动语态:
The sample was found to be nonradioactive. = 样品被发现是非放射性的。
The water is being treated to make it nonradioactive. = 正在处理水使其变成非放射性的。


疑问句:
Is the sample nonradioactive? = 样品是非放射性的吗？
Are all the components nonradioactive? = 所有组件都是非放射性的吗？


否定句:
The material is not nonradioactive; it is slightly radioactive. = 该材料并非非放射性的；它略微具有放射性。
The results indicated that the waste was not nonradioactive. = 结果表明废物并非非放射性的。
