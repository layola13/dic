词源:
The word "ogre" comes from the French word "ogres," which entered the English language in the 18th century.  The ultimate origin is uncertain, but some theories link it to the Slavic word "угор" (ugor), meaning "Hungarian," possibly reflecting a historical association of Hungarians with frightening or barbarian reputation in some Western European cultures.  Another possible origin is a connection to the Latin word "orcus," meaning "the underworld."
