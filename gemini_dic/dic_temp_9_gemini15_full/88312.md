词源:
The word "hip" meaning "stylish" or "fashionable" emerged in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) in the early to mid-20th century.  Its exact origins are debated, but it likely developed from earlier slang uses of "hip" related to being aware or knowledgeable, implying an understanding of underground or trendy culture. The superlative form "-est" is then added to create "hippest."
