The word "hingi" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's possible that:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  Please double-check the spelling.
2. **It's a word from another language:** It might be a word from a different language. If you can provide the language of origin, I might be able to help.
3. **It's a neologism or slang:** It could be a newly coined word or a slang term not yet widely recognized.  More context is needed.

To provide the analysis you request, I need the correct spelling or more information about the word's origin and context.
