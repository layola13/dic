The word "regiven" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized field.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.

To help you, I can offer some possibilities:

**Possibility 1: Misspelling**

It might be a misspelling of one of the following:

* **Regimen:** /ˈredʒɪmən/ | n. | 养生法；制度；政权 | A prescribed course of medical treatment, diet, or exercise for the restoration of health. | *He followed a strict fitness regimen.*  |近义词: routine, program, system |反义词: chaos, disorder


* **Regiven:** (If intended as a past participle of a verb)  This would imply something was given again.  However, "given" is already the past participle of "give".  The prefix "re" is redundant.  The correct usage would be "given again" or "re-given" (with a hyphen).


**Possibility 2: Neologism or Specialized Term**

If it's a newly coined word or a term from a specific field (e.g., technical jargon), more context is needed to understand its meaning and usage. Please provide the sentence or context in which you encountered this word.


**In short:** Without context or confirmation of its existence as a legitimate word, I cannot provide a complete analysis following your requested format.  Please provide more information.
