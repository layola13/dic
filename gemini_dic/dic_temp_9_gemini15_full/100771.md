USAGE->
This word is primarily used in behavioral psychology and doesn't typically appear in general conversation or writing.  Therefore, examples showcasing tense variations are not applicable in the same way as with common verbs.  The following demonstrate its usage within the context of behavioral analysis:


Example 1:
Stimulus: "What's the capital of France?"
Response: "Paris" (Intraverbal response)  =  刺激：“法国的首都是什么？” 回答：“巴黎”（言语内部反应）


Example 2:
Stimulus: "If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands."
Response: "Clap your hands." (Intraverbal response, though also an echoic response) = 刺激：“如果你快乐并且你知道，就拍拍手。”  回答：“拍拍手。”（言语内部反应，但也属于模仿性反应）


Example 3 (showing a failure of intraverbal behavior):
Stimulus: "What's the opposite of hot?"
Response: "Cold" (Correct intraverbal response) = 刺激：“热的相反是什么？” 回答：“冷”（正确的言语内部反应）


Example 4 (showing a failure of intraverbal behavior):
Stimulus: "What's the opposite of hot?"
Response:  "Fire" (Incorrect intraverbal response) = 刺激：“热的相反是什么？” 回答：“火”（错误的言语内部反应）
