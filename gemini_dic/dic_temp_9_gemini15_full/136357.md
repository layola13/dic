nonresonant: /ˌnɒnˈrezənənt/ | adj. | 非共振的，非谐振的 | Not exhibiting resonance; not capable of resonating.  Lacking resonance or vibrancy; dull or flat in sound. | The nonresonant cavity dampened the sound waves.  非共振腔体抑制了声波。 The nonresonant guitar strings produced a muted tone.  非共振吉他弦发出沉闷的声音。 | resonant, vibrant | muted, dull


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The material is nonresonant at this frequency. = 此频率下该材料是非共振的。
The speaker produces a nonresonant sound. = 扬声器发出非共振的声音。


一般过去时:
The experiment showed the cavity was nonresonant. = 实验表明该腔体是非共振的。
The singer's voice sounded nonresonant that night. = 那晚歌手的声音听起来很闷。


现在完成时:
The engineers have determined the structure to be nonresonant. = 工程师们已经确定该结构是非共振的。
The musician has noticed his instrument is becoming increasingly nonresonant. = 音乐家注意到他的乐器越来越不共振了。


过去完成时:
They had discovered that the earlier design was nonresonant. = 他们发现早期的设计是非共振的。
The researcher had found the material's nonresonant properties unexpectedly useful. = 研究人员意外地发现该材料的非共振特性非常有用。


将来时:
The new design will be nonresonant at the target frequency. = 新设计在目标频率下将是非共振的。
The updated software will likely minimize nonresonant frequencies. = 更新后的软件可能会最大限度地减少非共振频率。


虚拟语气:
If the material were nonresonant, the sound would be dampened. = 如果材料是非共振的，声音就会被抑制。

被动语态:
The frequencies were determined to be nonresonant. = 这些频率被确定为非共振的。
The sound quality is affected by nonresonant components. = 声品质受非共振组件的影响。


疑问句:
Is the cavity nonresonant at this frequency? = 此频率下该腔体是非共振的吗？
Are the nonresonant frequencies causing the problem? = 非共振频率是造成问题的原因吗？


否定句:
The material is not nonresonant; it actually resonates strongly. = 该材料并非非共振的；它实际上强烈共振。
The system isn't entirely nonresonant; there are some resonant peaks. = 该系统并非完全非共振的；存在一些共振峰值。


PHRASE->
