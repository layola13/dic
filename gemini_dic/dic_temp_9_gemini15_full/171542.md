词源:

The word "Pulitzer" is derived from the name of Joseph Pulitzer (1847-1911), a Hungarian-American newspaper publisher who established the Pulitzer Prizes in his will.  His surname, "Pulitzer," has its origins in the Hungarian language, though the precise etymology within Hungarian is not definitively established.  It's likely a family name with its own history of evolution and meaning within the Hungarian linguistic context.
