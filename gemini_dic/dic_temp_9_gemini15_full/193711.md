self-confirming:/ˌsɛlf kənˈfɜːrmɪŋ/ | adj. | 自证的；自我证实的 |  Describes a belief, prediction, or process that tends to produce evidence that confirms itself, even if it's initially false or based on flawed assumptions. This often happens because the belief influences actions or perceptions in a way that creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.  | Example:  The self-confirming prophecy of a failing business can lead to its actual collapse as employees lose morale and customers are hesitant to engage. = 一个失败企业的自我证实预言会导致其实际崩溃，因为员工士气低落，客户也不愿参与。


Example: His initial distrust of his colleagues led to a self-confirming cycle of suspicion and isolation. = 他最初对同事的不信任导致了猜疑和孤立的自我证实循环。| 近义词：self-fulfilling, self-reinforcing | 反义词：self-defeating, self-refuting |  adj.
