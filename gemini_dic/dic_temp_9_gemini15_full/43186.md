词源:  From Middle English *crabbed, from Old English *crabba "crab," referring to the crab's sideways movement and thus implying something difficult or awkward. The sense of "ill-tempered" likely developed from the association of the crab's pincers with irritability.  The connection to handwriting likely came from the association with something difficult to navigate or understand, like a crab's sideways movement.
