rain cats and dogs: /reɪn kæts ænd dɒɡz/ | idiom |下倾盆大雨 | This idiom means that it is raining very heavily.  The origin is uncertain, but several theories exist, none definitively proven.

Another points to a similar phrase from the 17th century, "raining cats and kittens". | It rained cats and dogs all afternoon.  = 下午下着倾盆大雨。
