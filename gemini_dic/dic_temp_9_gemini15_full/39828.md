词源:

The word "conspirator" comes from the Latin word "conspirator," which is formed from "conspirare," meaning "to breathe together," or "to plot together."  The prefix "con-" means "together," and "spirare" means "to breathe." The original sense implied a secret agreement, often whispered together, hence the connection to plotting.  Over time, the meaning evolved to specifically refer to those involved in illegal plots.
