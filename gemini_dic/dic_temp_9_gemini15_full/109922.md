词源：
From libel (n.) + -ist (suffix indicating a person who does something).  Libel itself comes from the Old French *libel*, from the Medieval Latin *libellus*, a diminutive of *liber* ("book").  The original sense was simply "a little book," but it evolved to refer to a defamatory written statement.
