extrabranchial: /ˌɛkstrəˈbræŋkiəl/ | adj. | 鳃外的；位于鳃外的 |  Relating to, situated outside, or occurring outside of the gills.  The term often refers to structures or processes that are associated with respiration or feeding but are not directly part of the gill apparatus itself. | Example: Extrabranchial organs are sometimes used in gas exchange in certain aquatic animals.  某些水生动物有时使用鳃外器官进行气体交换。 | 近义词: extragillar (less common)| 反义词: branchial
