clinometry:/klɪˈnɒmɪtri/| n. |斜度测量法；倾斜测量；坡度测量|The measurement of slope angles, typically of geological strata or other surfaces.  Clinometry is used in various fields, including geology, surveying, and construction, to determine the inclination or dip of a surface. |例句：The geologist used clinometry to determine the angle of the fault plane. 地质学家用斜度测量法确定断层面的角度。

例句：Precise clinometry measurements are crucial for the stability analysis of slopes in civil engineering projects.  精确的倾斜测量对于土木工程项目的边坡稳定性分析至关重要。


近义词：inclinometry, slope measurement, dip measurement|反义词：None directly applicable|词性：n.


词源:  From "clino-" (meaning "to slope" or "inclined," from Greek *klinein* "to lean, incline") + "-metry" (meaning "measurement," from Greek *metron* "measure").  Thus, clinometry literally means "the measurement of slopes."
