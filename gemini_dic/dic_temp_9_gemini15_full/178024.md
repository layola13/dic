词源:

The word "reckonable" derives from the verb "reckon," which ultimately comes from the Old Norse word "reikna," meaning "to calculate" or "to compute."  Over time, "reckon" evolved to encompass broader meanings, including "to consider" or "to estimate."  The addition of the suffix "-able" transforms the verb into an adjective, indicating something capable of being reckoned.
