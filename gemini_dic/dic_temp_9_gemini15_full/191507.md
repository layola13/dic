词源:

The word "schmaltz" comes from the Yiddish word "schmalz," meaning "rendered chicken fat."  Over time, its meaning evolved to describe anything excessively sentimental or overly rich, reflecting the richness and sometimes overwhelming nature of the fat itself.  The transition from a literal meaning of "chicken fat" to a figurative meaning of sentimental excess likely occurred due to the association of rich, fatty foods with indulgence and emotional excess.
