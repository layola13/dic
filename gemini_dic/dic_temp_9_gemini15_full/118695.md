metacausation:/ˌmɛtəˌkɔːˈzeɪʃən/| n. |元因果关系；间接因果关系|The study of metacausation explores indirect causal relationships, where one event influences another through a chain of intermediate events or processes.  It goes beyond simple cause-and-effect relationships to examine the complex web of influences that shape outcomes.| Example: The initial economic downturn (A) led to reduced consumer spending (B), which in turn resulted in factory closures (C) and increased unemployment (D). The relationship between A and D is a metacausation. |近义词：indirect causation, consequential causation |反义词：direct causation, immediate causation


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in academic and philosophical discussions, particularly in fields like systems theory, complexity science, and philosophy of causality.  There aren't common verb conjugations or other grammatical usages like those shown in the example for "what".  Instead, we'll explore how "metacausation" is used in different contexts.

Example 1 (Explaining a complex system):
The metacausation of climate change is intricate, involving not only greenhouse gas emissions but also feedback loops, deforestation, and societal structures.  = 气候变化的元因果关系错综复杂，不仅涉及温室气体排放，还涉及反馈回路、森林砍伐和社会结构。


Example 2 (Philosophical argument):
Some argue that free will is incompatible with a deterministic worldview due to the limitations of tracing metacausation throughout a complex system. = 有人认为，由于在复杂系统中追溯元因果关系的局限性，自由意志与决定论的世界观不相容。


Example 3 (Scientific analysis):
Researchers are investigating the metacausation of disease outbreaks, considering factors beyond immediate pathogens. = 研究人员正在调查疾病爆发的元因果关系，考虑了超出直接病原体的因素。


Example 4 (Discussing historical events):
The collapse of the Roman Empire wasn't a single event but a result of a complex metacausation involving economic instability, political corruption, and barbarian invasions. = 罗马帝国的崩溃不是单一事件，而是经济不稳定、政治腐败和野蛮人入侵等复杂元因果关系的结果。


PHRASE->
There aren't commonly used phrases directly involving "metacausation". The term itself is used as a standalone concept.  The following phrases might be used in sentences *about* metacausation:


Example 1:  "Understanding the chain of metacausation" = 理解元因果关系的链条
Example 2:  "Analyzing the levels of metacausation" = 分析元因果关系的层次
Example 3: "The complexity of metacausation" = 元因果关系的复杂性
Example 4: "Exploring the factors influencing metacausation" = 探讨影响元因果关系的因素
Example 5: "Modeling metacausation in complex systems" = 在复杂系统中模拟元因果关系
