sedimentations:/ˌsɛdəmənˈteɪʃənz/| n.|沉淀作用；沉积作用|The process of sediments settling out of a fluid, such as water or air.  It involves the gradual accumulation of solid particles at the bottom of a liquid or on a surface.|例句：The sedimentations in the riverbed are mainly composed of sand and silt. 河床中的沉淀物主要由沙子和淤泥组成。

例句：The slow sedimentations of the lake over thousands of years created layers of sediment.  湖泊数千年的缓慢沉淀作用形成了多层沉积物。|近义词：deposition, precipitation, settling|反义词：erosion, suspension
