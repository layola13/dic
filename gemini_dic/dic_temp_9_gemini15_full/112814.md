The word "luchador" is derived from the Spanish verb "luchar," meaning "to struggle" or "to fight."  The suffix "-dor" is a common Spanish suffix that forms nouns indicating a person who performs the action of the verb.  Therefore, "luchador" literally means "one who struggles" or "one who fights," perfectly fitting the profession of a wrestler.
