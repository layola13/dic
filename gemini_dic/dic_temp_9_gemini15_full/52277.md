dichogamous:/daɪˈkɒɡəməs/ | adj. | 雌雄异熟的；异时成熟的 |  Having the stamens and pistils of a flower maturing at different times, thus promoting cross-pollination.  This prevents self-pollination by ensuring that pollen is released when the stigma is not receptive, or vice versa. | Example:  Many plants exhibit dichogamous flowering, ensuring genetic diversity.  许多植物表现出雌雄异熟的开花方式，以确保遗传多样性。 | 近义词：heterogamous, protandrous, protogynous | 反义词：homogamous
