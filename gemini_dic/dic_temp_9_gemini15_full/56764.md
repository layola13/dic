The word "dop-wopper" does not exist in standard English dictionaries or common usage.  It's likely a neologism, a newly coined word, a misspelling, or a word specific to a very niche context (like slang within a particular community).  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide the requested analysis, I would need a valid word.
