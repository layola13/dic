The word "immensest" is the superlative form of the adjective "immense," meaning extremely large or great.  It indicates the highest degree of immensity.


词源:

The word "immense" comes from the Old French "immense," which itself derives from the Latin "immensus," a combination of the prefix "in-" (not) and "mensus" (measured).  Therefore, "immense" literally means "unmeasurable" or "boundless."  The suffix "-est" is the standard English superlative suffix added to adjectives.


用法说明:

While grammatically correct, "immensest" is rarely used in modern English.  Its use can sound overly emphatic or even slightly archaic.  In most cases, "immense" or "greatest," "largest," or other suitable superlatives will be preferred.  Its usage is generally confined to situations requiring strong emphasis on the extreme largeness or greatness of something.
