词源:  The origin of "knock for a loop" is uncertain but likely arose in the early to mid-20th century in American English.  The imagery suggests a forceful blow, like a punch, that sends someone reeling ("loop" referring to a circular motion or a dizzying sensation).  The precise path of its linguistic development is lost to history, but it's considered an idiom, meaning its meaning isn't literally derived from the individual words.
