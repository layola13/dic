词源:
From Old French *forestaler, from for- (expressing intensity) + estaler "to hinder, obstruct," of uncertain origin, possibly related to Old French estal "stall, stand," from Vulgar Latin *stabulum, from Latin stabulum "stable."  The sense evolved from "to obstruct a market" to the more general meaning of preventing or hindering.
