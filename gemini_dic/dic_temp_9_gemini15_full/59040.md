词源:
The word "dwarf" comes from Old English *dweorg, which itself has uncertain origins.  Some etymologists connect it to Proto-Germanic *twergwaz, suggesting a connection to words meaning "twisted" or "crooked," possibly referring to a perceived physical deformity.  Other theories propose links to Proto-Indo-European roots related to "to turn," suggesting a connection to the dwarves' often-portrayed skill in craftsmanship.  The modern spelling and pronunciation have evolved over time through various stages of English.
