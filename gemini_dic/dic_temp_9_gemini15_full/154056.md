词源:  The word "perhaps" is derived from the Middle English phrase "par aventure," meaning "by chance" or "by adventure."  "Par" is from Old French, and "aventure" ultimately comes from Latin "adventura," related to "advenire" (to arrive, to happen).  Over time, "par aventure" contracted into "peraunter" and then evolved into the modern "perhaps."
