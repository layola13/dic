词源:

The word "deritualizing" is formed by adding the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse") to the word "ritualizing," which in turn is derived from "ritual."  "Ritual" has its roots in the Latin word "rituale," meaning "a rite or ceremony."  Therefore, "deritualizing" literally means "removing the ritual" or "making something less ritualistic."
