词源:

The word "nightspot" is a compound word.  "Night" refers to the time of day, and "spot" in this context means a place or location.  Therefore, "nightspot" literally means "a place at night".  The word emerged in the 20th century as a convenient and evocative term for places of entertainment open during the evening and night.
