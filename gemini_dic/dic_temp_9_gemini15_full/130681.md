词源:

* **non-:**  prefix meaning "not"
* **affect-:**  from Latin *affectus*, past participle of *afficere* "to affect, influence" (related to *ad-* "to" + *facere* "to do, make").
* **-ive:**  suffix forming adjectives meaning "having the nature of" or "tending to".

Therefore, "nonaffective" literally means "not affecting" or "not influenced by affect (emotion)."
