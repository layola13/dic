词源:
The word "fagged" comes from the past participle of the now largely obsolete verb "fag," meaning "to tire."  This verb itself has a complex etymology, possibly stemming from Old French or a Middle English dialectal word with similar meaning.  The modern usage primarily retains the sense of extreme tiredness.
