词源:
The word "ketchup" has a long and interesting history, ultimately deriving from the Chinese word "kê-tsiap," referring to a fish sauce.  Over time, this term evolved through various iterations in Southeast Asia and eventually made its way to Europe, where it came to refer to a variety of sauces, including mushroom ketchup and walnut ketchup, before settling on its current tomato-based form in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
