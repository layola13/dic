词源:

The phrasal verb "go broke" is a fairly straightforward combination of the verb "go" (meaning to become or to enter a state) and the adjective "broke" (meaning without money, bankrupt).  "Broke" itself comes from the past participle of the verb "break," but in this context, it's evolved to function as an adjective describing a state of financial ruin. The precise etymology of this specific phrasal verb is difficult to pinpoint to a single historical moment, as its usage likely developed gradually through common speech.
