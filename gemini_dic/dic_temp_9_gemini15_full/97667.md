inhibitors:/ɪnˈhɪbɪtərz/| n.|抑制剂，阻滞剂|A substance that slows down or prevents a process.  Inhibitors are often used in chemistry and biology to control reactions or processes.|例句：Enzyme inhibitors are used to treat certain diseases by blocking the action of specific enzymes. 酶抑制剂通过阻断特定酶的作用来治疗某些疾病。|例句：The researchers discovered a new inhibitor that effectively prevents tumor growth. 研究人员发现了一种新的抑制剂，能有效阻止肿瘤生长。|近义词： suppressants, restrainers, blockers|反义词：activators, stimulants
