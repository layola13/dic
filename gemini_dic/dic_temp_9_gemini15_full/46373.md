词源:
The word "daddle" likely originated as a reduplication of a word related to "dabble," suggesting a light, unsteady movement.  Its precise etymological roots are somewhat obscure but are likely related to the onomatopoeic quality of the word, imitating the sound of someone moving slowly and unsteadily.
