The term "purge-off" is not a standard English word found in dictionaries or common usage.  It appears to be a compound word, possibly a newly coined term or a specific term within a niche context (e.g., technical jargon, slang).  Therefore, a complete etymological analysis and comprehensive grammatical breakdown as requested for a standard word is not possible.

However, we can analyze its potential meaning based on the individual components:

* **Purge:** /pɜːrdʒ/ | vt. | 清除；净化；清除（体内毒素）| To remove something completely; to cleanse or purify.  The word originates from Old French *purger* and ultimately from Latin *purgāre*.

* **Off:** /ɔːf/ | adv. | 关闭；离开；停止 | Away from; from a place; no longer active.  This word is of Old English origin.


Therefore, "purge-off" might imply an action of removing or eliminating something completely, resulting in a state of being "off" or deactivated.  This could apply to various contexts depending on the intended meaning.  For example:

* **In a computer context:** It might refer to the complete removal of data from a system or the shutting down of a process.
* **In a metaphorical context:** It could describe the complete removal of undesirable elements from a group or situation.


**Example (Hypothetical):**

"The system administrator performed a purge-off of all temporary files to free up disk space."  = 系统管理员执行了清除所有临时文件的操作以释放磁盘空间。

Without further context or confirmation of its usage within a specific field, a detailed grammatical analysis with examples across tenses and moods, as requested in the template, is not feasible for "purge-off."  It lacks the established grammatical structure and usage patterns of a standard English word.
