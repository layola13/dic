词源:

The word "controllability's" is derived from the word "controllable," which in turn comes from the verb "control."  The suffix "-ability" denotes the quality or state of being controllable, and the possessive 's' indicates possession or relationship (e.g., the characteristics of controllability).  The ultimate root lies in the Old French word "controille," meaning "counter-roll" or "check-roll," referring to a list used for supervision.
