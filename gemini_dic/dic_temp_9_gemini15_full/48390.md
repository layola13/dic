词源:
The word "dedecorous" is formed from the prefix "de-" (meaning "away from" or "opposite of") and the word "decorous," which means "proper" or "in good taste."  Therefore, "dedecorous" signifies the opposite of decorous, meaning "lacking decorum" or "improper."  The root ultimately traces back to the Latin word "decor," meaning "beauty" or "grace."
