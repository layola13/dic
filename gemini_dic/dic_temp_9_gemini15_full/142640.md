The word "ostosis" does not exist in standard English.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following your requested format.  It's possible there's a misspelling or it's a very specialized term from a specific field (e.g., a medical neologism). If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word), I might be able to offer some assistance.
