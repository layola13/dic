factorize:/ˈfæktəraɪz/ | vt. |因式分解；找出…的因素|To factorize a number or expression is to express it as a product of its factors.  This involves breaking down a number or expression into smaller parts that, when multiplied together, give the original number or expression. For example, factorizing 12 would result in 2 x 2 x 3.  In algebra, factorizing expressions involves finding common factors and rewriting the expression as a product of those factors. | Example:  The teacher showed the students how to factorize the quadratic equation.老师向学生展示了如何分解二次方程。

The equation x² + 5x + 6 can be factorized as (x + 2)(x + 3).  方程式x² + 5x + 6可以分解为(x + 2)(x + 3)。|近义词：factor, resolve into factors | 反义词：N/A

词源:
The word "factorize" is a combination of "factor" and the suffix "-ize," which means "to make or cause to be."  "Factor" comes from the Latin word "factor," meaning "doer, maker, agent."  Therefore, "factorize" literally means "to make into factors."
