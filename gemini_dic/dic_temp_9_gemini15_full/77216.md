gastraea: /ɡæsˈtriːə/ | n. |原肠胚|The gastraea is a hypothetical ancestral organism proposed by Ernst Haeckel to represent the common ancestor of all animals. It is characterized by a simple body plan with a single opening serving as both mouth and anus, and a two-layered structure consisting of an ectoderm and an endoderm.  This theory, while influential historically, is no longer widely accepted in its original form due to advances in evolutionary biology and genetics.  |The gastraea theory suggests that all animals evolved from a simple, two-layered organism.|The gastraea theory, once influential, is now largely superseded by more recent models of animal evolution.|近义词: protozoan (in a very loose sense, as a very early ancestor)|反义词: N/A


USAGE->

一般现在时:
The gastraea theory explains the development of animals. = 原肠胚理论解释了动物的发育。
This hypothesis posits a gastraea-like ancestor for all animals. = 这一假设认为所有动物都具有类似原肠胚的祖先。


一般过去时:
Haeckel proposed the gastraea theory in the 19th century. = 海克尔在19世纪提出了原肠胚理论。
Scientists debated the validity of the gastraea hypothesis for decades. = 科学家们几十年来一直在争论原肠胚假说的有效性。


现在完成时:
Researchers have challenged the original gastraea concept. = 研究人员已经对最初的原肠胚概念提出了质疑。
Modern biology has significantly refined our understanding of animal evolution since Haeckel's time. = 自海克尔时代以来，现代生物学已经大大完善了我们对动物进化的理解。


过去完成时:
Before the advent of molecular phylogenetics, the gastraea theory held considerable sway. = 在分子系统发育学出现之前，原肠胚理论具有相当大的影响力。
Scientists had long struggled to reconcile the gastraea hypothesis with the fossil record. = 科学家们长期以来一直在努力将原肠胚假说与化石记录相协调。


将来时:
Further research will likely refine our understanding of early animal evolution. = 进一步的研究可能会完善我们对早期动物进化的理解。
Future studies may uncover evidence supporting or refuting aspects of the gastraea concept. = 未来的研究可能会发现支持或反驳原肠胚概念某些方面的证据。


虚拟语气:
If the gastraea theory were entirely accurate, many questions about animal origins would be answered. = 如果原肠胚理论完全准确，许多关于动物起源的问题都将得到解答。
It is unlikely that the gastraea, in its original conception, would accurately represent the ancestor of all animals. = 原肠胚在其最初的概念中不太可能准确地代表所有动物的祖先。


被动语态:
The gastraea theory was initially widely accepted. = 原肠胚理论最初被广泛接受。
The implications of the gastraea hypothesis are still being debated today. = 原肠胚假说的含义至今仍在争论中。


疑问句:
What are the limitations of the gastraea theory? = 原肠胚理论的局限性是什么？
Does the current evidence support the gastraea hypothesis? = 当前的证据是否支持原肠胚假说？


否定句:
The gastraea theory is not universally accepted in its original form. = 原肠胚理论在其原始形式下并非普遍被接受。
The gastraea hypothesis does not fully explain the diversity of animal life. = 原肠胚假说并不能完全解释动物生命的多样性。
