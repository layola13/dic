pretimelinesses:/ˌpriːˈtaɪmlɪnəsiz/| n. |预先及时性；提前及时性|The word "pretimelinesses" is not a standard English word.  It appears to be a neologism,  a newly coined word, formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before) and "timelinesses" (the plural of timeliness, meaning the quality of being done or occurring at a favorable or opportune time).  Therefore, a precise definition and usage examples are difficult to provide without further context.  It suggests multiple instances of something being done ahead of schedule or appropriately early.  |例句：The study examined the pretimelinesses of various project milestones. (该研究考察了各个项目里程碑的提前及时性。)  The multiple pretimelinesses contributed to the project's overall success. (多次提前完成对项目的整体成功做出了贡献。) |近义词:  early completions, anticipatory actions, proactive measures |反义词: delays, latenesses, procrastination |n.
