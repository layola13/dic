recurse:/rɪˈkɜːrs/| v. |递归，反复出现 |To repeat or repeat itself, especially in a process or a system; to occur again. It often describes a function or algorithm that calls itself. |例句：The program recursed through the directory structure, processing each file.  程序递归地遍历目录结构，处理每个文件。

The function recursed until it reached the base case. 该函数递归调用直到达到基本情况。


近义词：iterate, reiterate, repeat |反义词：terminate, stop

USAGE->
一般现在时:
The program recurses through the data. = 程序递归遍历数据。
This function recurses until a condition is met. = 此函数递归直到满足条件。

一般过去时:
The algorithm recursed successfully. = 算法成功递归。
The function recursed many times before returning a result. = 该函数在返回结果之前递归调用多次。

现在完成时:
The process has recursed several times. = 该过程已经递归调用了几次。
The program has recursed through all the files. = 程序已经递归遍历了所有文件。

过去完成时:
The function had recursed before the error occurred. = 错误发生前函数已经递归调用。
The system had recursed deeply into the nested structure. = 系统已经深入嵌套结构进行递归调用。

将来时:
The function will recurse until it finds the solution. = 该函数将递归调用直到找到解决方案。
The program will recurse through the list. = 程序将递归遍历列表。

虚拟语气:
If the function were to recurse infinitely, it would crash. = 如果函数无限递归，它将会崩溃。
I wish the program hadn't recursed so deeply. = 我希望程序没有递归调用得这么深。

被动语态:
The data is recursed upon by the algorithm. = 数据被算法递归处理。
The problem was solved by a recursive function that recursed through the possibilities. = 这个问题通过一个递归函数解决，该函数递归遍历所有可能性。

疑问句:
Does the function recurse? = 该函数是否递归？
How many times does the algorithm recurse? = 算法递归调用多少次？

否定句:
The function does not recurse. = 该函数不递归。
The program did not recurse correctly. = 程序没有正确地递归。


PHRASE->
recursive function = 递归函数
recursive algorithm = 递归算法
recursive call = 递归调用
tail recursion = 尾递归
mutual recursion = 互相递归


词源:
The word "recurse" comes from the Latin prefix "re-" (again, back) and the verb "currere" (to run).  The concept of recursion in computer science emerged in the mid-20th century, built upon mathematical foundations laid earlier.  The modern usage reflects the iterative "running back" nature of the process.
