词源:

The word "light" has Old English roots, stemming from the Proto-Germanic *leukhtiz and ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European root *leuk-.  This root is associated with shining or brightness.  The various meanings of "light" (as a noun, adjective, and verb) developed over time from this core meaning of brightness and illumination.
