词源:  Derived from "reasonable" (adjective), which itself comes from "reason" (noun) + "-able" (suffix meaning "capable of"). The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective into a noun, signifying the quality or state.  The plural "-es" is added to indicate multiple instances or aspects of reasonableness.
