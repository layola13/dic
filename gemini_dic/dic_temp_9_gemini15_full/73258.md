词源:  The word combines "fore-" (meaning "before" or "in advance") and "gone" (past participle of "go," implying something that has already happened or is past).  The "-ness" suffix transforms the phrase into a noun, signifying the state or quality of being predetermined.  It essentially means "the state of being already determined or decided."
