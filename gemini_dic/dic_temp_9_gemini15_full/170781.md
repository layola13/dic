pseudocrystalline:/ˌsuːdoʊˈkrɪstəlɪn/ | adj. |似晶体的，准晶体的 |  Having a structure that resembles that of a crystal but lacks the perfect long-range order of a true crystal.  The material exhibits some crystalline properties, such as anisotropy and diffraction patterns, but these properties are not perfectly ordered throughout the entire structure. This is often due to defects, imperfections, or a disordered arrangement of molecules or atoms. | Example:  The polymer displayed a pseudocrystalline structure with regions of short-range order.  聚合物显示出具有短程有序区域的似晶体结构。|近义词:paracrystalline, semicrystalline |反义词:crystalline, amorphous
