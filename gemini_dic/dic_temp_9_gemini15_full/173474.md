词源：

* **quasi-**: This prefix comes from Latin, meaning "as if," "seemingly," or "apparently."  It indicates a resemblance or approximation to something but not a complete identity.

* **false**: This word also has Latin roots, deriving from the Old English "fals," meaning "deceitful" or "untrue."


用法说明：

`quasi-false` is primarily used as an adjective to describe statements, arguments, or information that are not entirely false but are nevertheless misleading or inaccurate because they present an incomplete or distorted picture of the truth.  It highlights the nuanced nature of deception, where the falsehood might be subtle or partial.  Unlike "false," which implies a complete lack of truth, "quasi-false" acknowledges the presence of some truth while emphasizing the overall misleading nature of the information.
