词源:  From *echelon* (a formation of troops, equipment, or personnel in a series of levels or stages) + *-ment* (a suffix forming nouns of action or state).  The word *echelon* itself has a French origin, ultimately deriving from the Old French word *eschelon*, meaning "rung of a ladder," reflecting the layered structure it describes.
