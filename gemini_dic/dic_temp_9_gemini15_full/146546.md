overgloominesses:/ˌoʊvərˈɡluːminɪsɪz/| n.|过度忧郁；极度悲观； |The word "overgloominesses" is not a standard English word. It's a nonce word, meaning it's created for a specific occasion and not part of common vocabulary.  It's formed by adding "-nesses" (a pluralizing suffix implying multiple instances of a state or quality) to "overgloominess," which itself is an intensification of "gloominess."  The word suggests an excessive or overwhelming amount of gloominess or depression.  Because it's not a standard word, there are no readily available synonyms, antonyms, or common phrases involving it.
