megafarad:/ˈmɛɡəˌfæræd/| n. |兆法拉,百万法拉|A megafarad (MF) is a unit of electrical capacitance equal to one million farads.  It represents a very large capacitance, typically found in specialized applications.|Example:  The supercapacitor bank has a total capacitance of several megafarads.  这个超级电容器组的总电容为几百万法拉。|近义词:  (None directly equivalent, as it's a unit of measurement)|反义词: (None directly opposite, but smaller units like microfarad are the opposite in magnitude)|


USAGE->
This word is primarily a unit of measurement and doesn't have verb conjugations or other grammatical variations like "hello".  The usage is purely descriptive.

Example 1: The experiment required a capacitor with a capacitance of at least 10 megafarads. 实验需要一个至少10兆法拉电容的电容器。

Example 2:  Modern supercapacitors can achieve capacitances in the megafarad range. 现代超级电容器可以达到兆法拉级的电容。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly involving "megafarad".  Its usage is confined to technical contexts.
