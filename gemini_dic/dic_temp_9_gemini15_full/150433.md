PHRASE->
There are no common idiomatic phrases specifically using "pansyish."  The word itself is generally used as a standalone adjective.  Phrases would need to be constructed around it, for example:  "a pansyish attempt," "remarkably pansyish," "somewhat pansyish."


词源:
The word derives from "pansy," a flower known for its delicate appearance. The association of the flower with effeminacy led to the pejorative use of "pansyish" to describe someone perceived as lacking masculinity.  This usage is considered offensive and should be avoided in most contexts.
