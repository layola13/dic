gneissic:/ˈnaɪsɪk/ | adj. |片麻状的，片岩状的 | Relating to or characteristic of gneiss; having a banded texture.  Gneiss is a metamorphic rock with a banded texture. The banding is due to the segregation of minerals during metamorphism.  | Example: The gneissic rock formations were a stunning sight. 片麻状岩石构造是一道令人惊叹的景象。 |近义词：banded, foliated | 反义词：unbanded, massive
