词源：

From Old English *fēorþa, from fēower "four".  The suffix "-th" is a common ordinal number suffix in English, denoting position in a sequence.


用法说明：

Fourth can be used as an adjective to modify a noun, indicating its position in a series:

The fourth floor is where the library is.  (第四层是图书馆所在地。)

It is also used as a noun, though less frequently:

She came in fourth. (她获得了第四名。)

It is important to note that fourth is not used in the same way as cardinal numbers (one, two, three, four). It’s not used to count items, but rather to describe the position of an item in a sequence.
