词源:
destitute comes from the Latin word "destituere," meaning "to forsake," "to abandon," or "to leave destitute."  The prefix "de-" means "away from" or "completely," and "stituere" means "to set," "to place," or "to establish."  Therefore, the original meaning points to a state of being completely abandoned or left without support.
