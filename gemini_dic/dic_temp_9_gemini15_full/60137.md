They can be muscles, glands, or other organs that carry out the instructions of the nervous or endocrine systems. | Example: Muscles are effectors that respond to signals from the nervous system, causing movement.  肌肉是响应神经系统信号而引起运动的效应器。 The glands are effectors that secrete hormones in response to hormonal or neural signals.腺体是响应激素或神经信号分泌激素的效应器。|近义词：actuator, executor, agent |反义词：receptor, sensor

将来时:
The effectors will respond quickly to the impending threat. = 效应器将迅速响应迫在眉睫的威胁。
The system will utilize different effectors depending on the situation. = 系统将根据情况利用不同的效应器。


虚拟语气:
If the effectors were more efficient, the response would be faster. = 如果效应器更有效率，反应就会更快。

词源:

The word "effector" comes from the Latin word "efficere," meaning "to bring about," "to accomplish," or "to effect."  The suffix "-or" indicates an agent or doer.  Therefore, an effector is something that brings about or accomplishes an effect.
