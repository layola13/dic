词源:
The word "ralliance" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a misspelling of "reliance," which comes from the Old French *reliéance,  from the verb *relier, meaning "to bind, to connect."  The prefix "re-" indicates "again" or "back," implying a strengthening or re-establishment of a connection.  The suffix "-ance" denotes a state or quality.
