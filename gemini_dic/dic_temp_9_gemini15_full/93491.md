词源:

Illustrious ultimately derives from the Latin word "illustrare," meaning "to make bright, to illuminate, to clarify."  The "il-" prefix is an intensifier, and "-lustrare" is related to the word "lux," meaning "light." Thus, the original sense implied making something bright or clear, and by extension, making someone famous and renowned.  The transition from "making bright" to "renowned" reflects the metaphorical association of brightness with fame and glory.
