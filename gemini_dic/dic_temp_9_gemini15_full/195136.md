semicured:/ˈsɛmɪkjʊrd/ | adj. | 半固化的；半熟的 | Partially cured; not fully hardened or set.  This term is often used in the context of materials science, particularly regarding polymers and rubber. | Example: The semicured rubber was still pliable enough to be molded. 半固化的橡胶仍然柔软到可以成型。 The semicured resin required further processing to achieve full hardness. 半固化的树脂需要进一步加工才能达到完全硬度。|近义词：partially cured, partially hardened | 反义词：fully cured, fully hardened
