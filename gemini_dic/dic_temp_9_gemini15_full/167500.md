previctorious: /ˌpriːvɪkˈtɔːriəs/ | adj. | 先胜的；预先取胜的 |  A previctorious adjective, not found in standard dictionaries, would describe something that ensures victory beforehand or suggests a certain victory before any contest.  It implies a decisive advantage or a situation where success is virtually guaranteed.  The word combines "pre-" (before) and "victorious" (having won a victory). Because it's a neologism (newly coined word), there are no established examples of usage in reputable sources. Therefore,例句，近义词，反义词，词性 are unavailable.  The word could be used hypothetically in a sentence like this, but its meaning depends entirely on the context:


例句(假设):  The team felt previctorious after their opponent's key player was injured. =  在对方关键球员受伤后，这支球队感到胜券在握。


近义词:  (There are no direct synonyms because the word is not established.  Possible related words depending on the intended nuance): assured of victory, certain to win, overwhelmingly favored


反义词: (Similarly, antonyms depend heavily on context):  doomed to fail, certain to lose, hopelessly outmatched


词性: adjective
