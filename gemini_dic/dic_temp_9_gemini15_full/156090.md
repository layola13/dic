photoregulator: /ˈfoʊtoʊˌreɡjʊleɪtər/ | n. | 光调节器；感光调节器 | A photoregulator is a device that regulates or controls a process or system in response to light.  It may involve sensing light intensity and adjusting a corresponding output, such as the brightness of a screen or the growth of a plant. | Example: The photoregulator in the street lamp automatically adjusts the brightness based on ambient light levels. 街灯中的光调节器会根据环境光线水平自动调节亮度。 |近义词: light sensor, light controller, photosensor |反义词:  (no direct antonym, but the opposite function would be a light amplifier or a system without light regulation)|名词
