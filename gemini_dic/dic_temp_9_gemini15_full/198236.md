词源:
The word "shorthander" is a relatively straightforward compound word.  It combines "shorthand" (a system of writing using abbreviated symbols) with the agentive suffix "-er" (indicating a person who performs an action).  Therefore, its etymology traces back to the development of shorthand systems themselves, which have roots in ancient methods of abbreviating writing, evolving over time into the more formalized systems used today.  The "-er" suffix is of Germanic origin.


用法说明:

This word is primarily used as a noun and is straightforward in its meaning.  It refers specifically to a person whose job or skill is shorthand writing.  While "stenographer" might be considered a more formal synonym, "shorthander" is perfectly acceptable and understandable in most contexts. There's no specific grammatical usage beyond basic noun usage.  You would use it as you would any other noun in a sentence—as a subject, object, or part of a noun phrase.
