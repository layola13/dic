词源:

The word "dippinesses" is derived from the noun "dippiness," which in turn comes from the verb "dip."  "Dip" has Old English roots, possibly related to the Old English word "dypan," meaning "to plunge" or "to immerse."  The "-ness" suffix transforms the adjective "dippy" (meaning slightly foolish or eccentric, also implying a state of being dipped) into a noun, indicating a state or quality.  The addition of "-es" creates the plural form.
