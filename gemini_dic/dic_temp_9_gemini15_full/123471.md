monosporous:/ˈmɒnəʊspɔːrəs/| adj.| 单孢子的 |  Relating to or characterized by having only one spore.  A monosporous culture is derived from a single spore. | Example: The monosporous culture allowed for the study of a genetically uniform population of fungi. 单孢子培养允许对遗传上均一的真菌群体进行研究。|近义词：unisporous |反义词：polysporous
