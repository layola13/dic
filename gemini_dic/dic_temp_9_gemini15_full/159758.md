polyembryony:/ˌpɒliɪmˈbraɪəni/ | n. |多胚现象 |The development of more than one embryo from a single fertilized ovum.  This phenomenon occurs naturally in some plants and animals, resulting in genetically identical offspring. |Example: Polyembryony is a common reproductive strategy in certain citrus fruits, leading to multiple seedlings from a single seed.  多胚现象在某些柑橘类水果中是一种常见的繁殖策略，导致单粒种子长出多个幼苗。|近义词：multiple embryogenesis |反义词：monoembryony
