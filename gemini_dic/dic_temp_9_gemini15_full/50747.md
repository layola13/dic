词源:The word "derringer" comes from Henry Deringer, a Philadelphia gunsmith who popularized a type of small-bore pistol in the early 19th century.  Although the spelling often varies (Deringer, derringer), the pronunciation and meaning remain the same.  The design was later copied and improved upon by others, but the name stuck.
