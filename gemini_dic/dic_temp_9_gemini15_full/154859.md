词源:
The word "perversely" derives from the adjective "perverse," which comes from the Old French "pervers" and ultimately from the Latin "perversus," meaning "turned away," "turned aside," or "wrong."  The "per-" prefix means "through" or "completely," and "versus" means "turned." Thus, the original sense relates to a turning away from what is right or expected.
