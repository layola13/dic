labialism:/ˈleɪbiəlɪzəm/| n. |唇音化；唇音使用|The use of sounds produced by bringing the lips together.  It is a feature of many languages, and can refer to the manner of articulation, the sounds themselves, or even the prominence of lip movements in speech.  The study of labial sounds and their role in phonology is a significant aspect of phonetics. | Example: The pronunciation of the English /p/, /b/, and /m/ sounds involves labialism.  唇音/p/、/b/和/m/的发音涉及唇音化。|近义词：labialization, lip rounding|反义词：None directly opposite, but could be considered the opposite of sounds made with other articulators (e.g., dental, alveolar)|
