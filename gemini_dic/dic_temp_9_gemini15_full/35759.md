PHRASE->
(This word is rarely used in phrases beyond its literal meaning.)

Note:  While "cock-a-doodle-doo" is onomatopoeia, representing the sound of a rooster, it doesn't fit neatly into traditional grammatical categories like nouns, verbs, or adjectives.  Its primary function is as an interjection, mimicking a sound.  Therefore, standard grammatical tense analysis is not applicable.
