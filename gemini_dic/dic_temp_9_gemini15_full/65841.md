词源:

From eviscerate + -ing.  Eviscerate comes from  Late Latin *eviscerāre, from Latin *e- "out" + viscera "entrails".  The original meaning related to disemboweling. The figurative use, meaning to severely criticize, developed later.


用法说明:

eviscerating 主要用作形容词，用来描述批评、评论或攻击的力度。它强调批评的彻底性和严厉程度，往往暗示着批评对象受到了极大的伤害或打击。

虽然eviscerating 源于“取出内脏”的字面意思，但在现代英语中，几乎只用于比喻意义。
