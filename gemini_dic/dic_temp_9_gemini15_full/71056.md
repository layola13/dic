词源:
The word "first-rateness" is a compound word. "First-rate" originally referred to a classification of ships in the British Royal Navy, with "first-rate" denoting the largest and most powerful ships.  This usage extended metaphorically to describe anything of the highest quality or standard.  The suffix "-ness" is added to create the noun form, indicating the state or quality of being first-rate.
