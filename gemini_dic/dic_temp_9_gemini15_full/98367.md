The word "insistency" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  If you meant a different word, please provide the correct spelling.

If "insistency" was intended as a combination of "insistence" and possibly a suffix, it would imply a strong or repeated emphasis on something.  However, without a proper definition or context, a detailed analysis is impossible.
