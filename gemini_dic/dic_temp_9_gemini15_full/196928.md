shadowmap:/ˈʃædoʊmæp/| n. |阴影贴图|A shadow map is a technique in computer graphics used to create realistic shadows in a 3D scene. It works by rendering the scene from the light's point of view, storing the results in a texture map (the shadow map), and then using this map to determine which parts of the scene are in shadow when rendering from the camera's point of view.  This is a more efficient method than calculating shadows directly for every polygon in the scene.|Example: The game uses shadow mapping to create realistic shadows, improving the overall visual quality.|近义词：shadow rendering, depth map|反义词：无


USAGE->
This word is a noun and doesn't have verb conjugations like "is," "was," etc.  Therefore, typical verb tense examples are not applicable.  The usage revolves around how it functions within a sentence as a noun.

Example 1: The quality of the shadow map directly impacts the realism of the shadows in the game.  = 阴影贴图的质量直接影响游戏阴影的真实感。

Example 2:  High-resolution shadow maps are computationally expensive but produce superior results. = 高分辨率阴影贴图计算量大，但效果更好。


PHRASE->
shadow map resolution: 阴影贴图分辨率
shadow map bias: 阴影贴图偏差
percentage closer filtering (PCF) shadow map: 百分比更近过滤（PCF）阴影贴图
shadow map filtering: 阴影贴图过滤
cascaded shadow maps: 级联阴影贴图
