PHRASE->
This word does not readily lend itself to common phrases.  Phrases using "nonirritable" would be more common.  Examples using related concepts:

a remarkable calmness =非凡的冷静
a surprising equanimity =令人惊讶的镇定
a state of placidity =平静的状态
an air of composure =镇定的神态
a display of patience =展现耐心


词源:
The word is formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not"), "irritable" (easily provoked to anger), and "-nesses" (a suffix forming abstract nouns of quality or state).  Therefore, it literally means "the states or qualities of not being easily provoked to anger."
