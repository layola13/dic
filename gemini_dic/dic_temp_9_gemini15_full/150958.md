paramagnetism:/ˌpæræmæɡˈnɛtɪzəm/| n. |顺磁性 |Paramagnetism is a form of magnetism whereby some materials are weakly attracted to an externally applied magnetic field. Unlike ferromagnetism, paramagnetic materials do not retain any magnetization in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field. This is because the magnetic moments of the atoms in a paramagnetic material are randomly oriented in the absence of a field, and only become aligned when a field is applied.  | Example: Oxygen is a paramagnetic substance, meaning it is weakly attracted to a magnetic field.  氧气是一种顺磁性物质，这意味着它会被磁场微弱地吸引。|近义词：weak magnetism|反义词：diamagnetism, ferromagnetism
