reemission's:/ˌriːɪˈmɪʃənz/| n. |再发射；再辐射；再排放|The process of emitting something again, such as light, radiation, or pollutants.  This is the possessive form of "reemission", indicating possession or belonging.  For example, "the reemission's intensity" refers to the intensity of the reemission.|The reemission's intensity was significantly reduced after the filter was installed. 再发射的强度在安装过滤器后显著降低了。 The study focused on the reemission's impact on the environment.  该研究侧重于再排放对环境的影响。|emission, radiation, discharge|absorption, retention|名词


USAGE->
