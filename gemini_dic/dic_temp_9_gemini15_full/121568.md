词源:
The word "misnavigated" is formed by adding the prefix "mis-" (meaning wrongly or badly) to the past participle of "navigate" (to steer a ship or aircraft, or to find one's way).  "Navigate" comes from the Latin "navigare,"  itself a combination of "navis" (ship) and "agere" (to drive or move).  Therefore, "misnavigated" literally means "to have steered a ship or found one's way incorrectly."
