词源:
The word "philanderer" comes from the verb "philander," which is ultimately derived from the Greek word "philandros," meaning "man-loving."  However, the modern usage has shifted significantly, now primarily associated with men having numerous casual sexual relationships, rather than the original broader meaning of being fond of love or company.
