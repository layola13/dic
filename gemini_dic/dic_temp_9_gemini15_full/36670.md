colliders:/kəˈlaɪdərz/| n.|碰撞器，对撞机|A collider is a machine that accelerates particles to very high speeds and then allows them to collide, allowing scientists to study the results of these collisions.  This is often used in particle physics experiments to discover new particles or to test theories about the fundamental forces of nature.|例句：The Large Hadron Collider is the world's largest and most powerful particle collider.  大型强子对撞机是世界上最大、最强大的粒子对撞机。

The experiment used a collider to study the behavior of protons at high energies. 实验使用对撞机研究高能质子的行为。|近义词：accelerator, smasher|反义词：无
