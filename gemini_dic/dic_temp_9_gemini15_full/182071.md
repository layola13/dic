remeshing:/ˌriːˈmɛʃɪŋ/| n. |重新网格化，重新划分网格|The process of creating a new mesh from an existing one, often to improve its quality or adapt it to a different purpose. This involves changing the geometry and topology of the mesh, such as the number and arrangement of vertices, edges, and faces.|Example: Remeshing the 3D model significantly improved its rendering performance.  重新划分三维模型的网格显著提高了其渲染性能。|近义词：re-meshing, mesh refinement, mesh reconstruction |反义词：mesh simplification
