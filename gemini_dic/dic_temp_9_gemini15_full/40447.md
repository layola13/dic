ETYMOLOGY->
The word "contrastiveness" is derived from the adjective "contrastive," which in turn comes from the verb "contrast."  "Contrast" originates from the Old French word "contraster,"  itself derived from the Latin prefix "contra-" (against, opposite) and the verb "stare" (to stand).  Therefore, "contrastiveness" ultimately signifies the quality of standing out against or in opposition to something else.
