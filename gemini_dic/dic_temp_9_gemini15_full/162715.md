prebarbarous:/ˌpriːˈbɑːrbərəs/| adj. | 半野蛮的，处于野蛮状态之前的 |  Describing a stage of society or culture that is transitioning from a primitive or savage state towards civilization, but still retains some aspects of barbarism. It implies a state of relative disorder and lack of refinement, but not entirely lacking in social structures. | The prebarbarous society lacked advanced technology but had established a system of social hierarchy and trade.  =  这个处于半野蛮状态的社会缺乏先进技术，但已经建立了社会等级制度和贸易体系。


The term suggests a period before fully developed barbarism, possibly characterized by nascent social structures, rudimentary forms of governance, and a blending of primitive and developing cultural elements.  It's a nuanced term not frequently used, often replaced by terms like "primitive," "uncivilized," or "early."
