词源:  The noun "enthrallment" is derived from the verb "enthrall," which itself comes from the Old English "þræl" meaning "slave" or "serf."  The prefix "en-" intensifies the meaning.  Therefore, the original sense implied being held captive by something, usually something pleasant, like a captivating story or performance.  Over time, the negative connotation of slavery faded, leaving the modern sense of being completely captivated and fascinated.
