hexandrous: /hekˈsændrəs/ | adj. | 六雄蕊的 | Having six stamens.  This term is primarily used in botany to describe flowers with six stamens, the pollen-producing part of a flower.  The word combines "hexa-" (six) and "-androus" (referring to stamens).


例句：

This species is characterized by its hexandrous flowers and vibrant petals.  该物种的特点是其六雄蕊的花朵和鲜艳的花瓣。


近义词：  There aren't direct synonyms, as it's a specific botanical term.  However, words describing flowers with a specific number of stamens could be considered related, e.g.,  tetradrous (four stamens),  pentadrous (five stamens), etc.


反义词：  No direct antonyms exist.  The opposite would imply a flower with a different number of stamens (e.g.,  a flower with fewer or more than six stamens).
