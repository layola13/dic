perite:/ˈpɛraɪt/| n. |包晶体；围岩；(矿物)闪锌矿|A perite is a mineral that occurs as a coating or encrustation on other minerals, often in cavities or fissures in rocks.  It is typically characterized by its radiating crystalline structure.  Perite can also refer to the surrounding rock or matrix in which a mineral or other inclusion is found.|例句：The geode contained beautiful crystals of quartz, surrounded by a layer of perite.|近义词：coating, encrustation, matrix|反义词：core, center


USAGE->
This word's usage is primarily limited to geology and mineralogy, so extensive grammatical examples across tenses are not applicable in the same way as a common word like "what".  The noun "perite" is usually used in simple declarative sentences.

一般现在时:
The perite surrounds the quartz crystals. = 包晶体包围着石英晶体。
This sample shows a significant perite layer. = 这个样本显示了一层明显的包晶体。


一般过去时:
The geologist identified the perite as calcite. = 地质学家将包晶体鉴定为方解石。
We found a cavity filled with perite and pyrite. = 我们发现了一个充满包晶体和黄铁矿的空洞。


现在完成时:
Researchers have studied the formation of perite in this region. = 研究人员已经研究了该地区包晶体的形成。
They have discovered a new type of perite mineral. = 他们发现了一种新型的包晶体矿物。


过去完成时:
Before the analysis, they had removed the surrounding perite. = 在分析之前，他们已经去除了周围的包晶体。
Geologists had already observed similar perite formations. = 地质学家已经观察到类似的包晶体构造。


将来时:
We will analyze the perite composition tomorrow. = 我们明天将分析包晶体的成分。
Scientists will likely discover more about perite in future studies. = 科学家们很可能会在未来的研究中发现更多关于包晶体的知识。


被动语态:
The perite was carefully examined under a microscope. = 包晶体在显微镜下被仔细检查。
The sample's perite layer was found to be quite thick. = 样本的包晶体层被发现相当厚。


PHRASE->
There are limited common phrases directly involving "perite" due to its specialized usage.  Phrases would typically involve descriptive adjectives or other geological terms. Examples:


massive perite = 块状包晶体
radiating perite = 放射状包晶体
perite layer = 包晶体层
type of perite = 包晶体类型
analysis of perite = 包晶体分析
