词源:
The word "pooch" is of uncertain origin. Some etymologists suggest it may be an alteration of the Middle English word "pouche," meaning "bag" or "pouch," perhaps referring to a dog's loose, baggy skin.  Others suggest it's a dialectal variant of "pup," a common term for a young dog.  Its use as a term of endearment for a dog solidified in the 20th century.
