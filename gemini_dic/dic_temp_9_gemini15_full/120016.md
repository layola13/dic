WORD ORIGIN->

The word "milling" comes from the Old English word "mylen," meaning "to grind," which itself is from the Proto-Germanic *malaną, which was also the root of the word "meal."  The modern meanings of milling have evolved to encompass both the original sense of grinding grain and also the later sense of machining metal.
