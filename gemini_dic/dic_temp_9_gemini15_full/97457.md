infusoria:/ˌɪnfuˈzɔːriə/| n.|纤毛虫；草履虫（复数）|Microscopic, single-celled organisms belonging to the phylum Ciliophora, characterized by their cilia (hair-like structures) used for locomotion and feeding.  They are often found in freshwater and are a significant part of the food chain.  The term is now largely considered outdated in scientific contexts, with more specific classifications preferred.|例句：The pond water teemed with infusoria.  池塘水里充满了纤毛虫。|例句：Early microscopists often studied infusoria to learn about single-celled life. 早期的显微镜学家经常研究纤毛虫来了解单细胞生物。|近义词：ciliates, protozoa|反义词：N/A

否定句:
The sample did not contain any infusoria. = 样本中没有任何纤毛虫。
He didn't believe that those were infusoria. = 他不相信那些是纤毛虫。


PHRASE->
types of infusoria = 纤毛虫的种类
culture of infusoria = 纤毛虫培养
study of infusoria = 纤毛虫的研究
distribution of infusoria = 纤毛虫的分布
observation of infusoria = 纤毛虫的观察


词源:
The word "infusoria" comes from the Latin word "infusum," meaning "infused" or "poured in."  Early microscopists used infusions (water containing decaying organic matter) to cultivate these microorganisms, hence the name.  The term reflects the historical method of observing these organisms, not a modern taxonomic classification.
