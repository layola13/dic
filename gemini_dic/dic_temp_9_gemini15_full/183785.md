词源:
The word "rescuer" comes from the verb "rescue," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "rescoure," meaning "to run back." This reflects the act of going back to retrieve or save something or someone.  The "re-" prefix emphasizes the action of returning to a previous place to perform the rescue. The "-er" suffix transforms the verb into a noun, denoting the person performing the action.
