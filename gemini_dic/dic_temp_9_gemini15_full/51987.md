diageotropic:/ˌdaɪədʒiːoʊˈtrɒpɪk/| adj. | 向地性（负向地性）的 | Growing or moving away from the earth; opposite of geotropic.  Diageotropic growth is characteristic of some plant parts, such as shoots that grow upwards against gravity. | Example:  The stems exhibited a strong diageotropic response, growing upward against the pull of gravity.  茎展现出强烈的负向地性反应，向上对抗重力生长。|近义词：negative geotropism,  apgeotropic| 反义词：geotropic


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The roots show a geotropic response. = 根显示出向地性反应。
This plant exhibits diageotropic growth. = 这植物展现出负向地性生长。


一般过去时:
The stem grew diageotropically. = 茎负向地性生长。
The roots responded geotropically to the gravity. = 根对重力作出了向地性反应。


现在完成时:
The seedlings have developed a strong diageotropic growth pattern. = 幼苗已经形成了强烈的负向地性生长模式。
The experiment has shown the geotropic nature of the roots. = 实验已经显示了根的向地性。


过去完成时:
The shoot had already established a diageotropic growth before the light was introduced. = 在引入光照之前，芽已经建立了负向地性生长。
The plant had already shown geotropic response to gravity before the experiment. = 在实验之前，植物已经对重力表现出向地性反应。


将来时:
The vine will grow diageotropically towards the sun. = 葡萄藤将向日生长，表现为负向地性。
The roots will respond geotropically to the pull of gravity. = 根将对重力的拉力产生向地性反应。


虚拟语气:
If the plant were grown in darkness, it would still show some diageotropic response. = 即使植物在黑暗中生长，它仍然会表现出一些负向地性反应。
If the roots were not geotropic, they would not grow downwards. = 如果根不是向地性的，它们就不会向下生长。


被动语态:
Diageotropic growth is observed in many plants. = 在许多植物中观察到负向地性生长。
Geotropic responses are influenced by various factors. = 向地性反应受多种因素影响。


疑问句:
Is the growth of this stem diageotropic? = 这茎的生长是负向地性吗？
Are the roots exhibiting a geotropic response? = 根是否表现出向地性反应？


否定句:
The roots are not diageotropically growing. = 根不是负向地性生长。
The plant's growth is not purely geotropic. = 植物的生长并非纯粹的向地性。


PHRASE->
diageotropic response = 负向地性反应
diageotropic growth = 负向地性生长
diageotropic movement = 负向地性运动
negative geotropism = 负向地性
apgeotropism = 向上生长 (同义词)
