词源:

The word "denationalizations" is derived from the verb "denationalize," which itself is formed from the prefix "de-" (meaning "to remove" or "to reverse") and the noun "nationalization."  "Nationalization" comes from "nationalize," which is built from "national" (relating to a nation) and the suffix "-ize" (meaning "to make" or "to become").  Therefore, "denationalizations" signifies the process of reversing or undoing nationalization.
