The word "preenforce" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information following the requested format.  The word might be a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or technical field.  If you can provide more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a more informed response.
