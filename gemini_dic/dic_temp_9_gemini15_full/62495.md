endosymbiotic: /ˌɛndoʊˌsɪmbaɪˈɑːtɪk/ | adj. |内共生的| Relating to symbiosis in which one organism lives within the body or cell of another.  It describes a close relationship between two organisms where one lives inside the other, and both benefit from the arrangement. This is a key theory in the evolution of eukaryotic cells, explaining the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts. | Example: The endosymbiotic theory explains the origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts in eukaryotic cells.  内共生理论解释了真核细胞中线粒体和叶绿体的起源。|近义词: symbiotic (but less specific)|反义词: parasitic (opposite relationship where one organism harms the other)
