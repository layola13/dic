oenanthyl: /oʊˈænθɪl/ | n. | 庚酰基 |  Enanthyl is a chemical group derived from heptanoic acid (also known as enanthic acid). It consists of a seven-carbon chain with a carboxyl group (-COOH) replaced by a carbonyl group (=O)  resulting in a -C₇H₁₅CO-  functional group. It's often found as a substituent in larger organic molecules. |  Example:  Oenanthyl derivatives are found in various natural products. 庚酰基衍生物存在于多种天然产物中。| 近义词:  heptanoyl (化学上等同) | 反义词:  None (no direct opposite) |  n.


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in chemistry and biochemistry, not in everyday language.  Therefore, typical grammatical examples like those shown for "what" are not applicable.  Instead, examples illustrating its usage in chemical contexts are provided below:


Chemical Naming:

The oenanthyl group is part of the name of many organic compounds. For example, oenanthyl chloride (C₇H₁₅COCl) is a derivative of heptanoic acid. 庚酰氯（C₇H₁₅COCl）是庚酸的衍生物。


Reactions:

Oenanthyl bromide can undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions. 庚酰溴可以发生亲核取代反应。


Synthesis:

The synthesis of oenanthyl esters involves the reaction of heptanoic acid with an alcohol.  庚酰酯的合成涉及庚酸与醇的反应。
