enums:/ˈiːnʌmz/| n.|枚举类型，枚举|English: In computer programming, an enum (short for enumeration) is a data type that consists of a set of named constants.  It's a way to give meaningful names to a set of integer values, making code more readable and maintainable.  Each named constant is assigned a unique integer value, often starting from 0 by default, but can be explicitly assigned other values.  Enums are often used to represent a fixed set of options or states.|例句：We used an enum to represent the days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.). 我们用枚举类型来表示一周中的日子（星期一、星期二、星期三等）。


The following example demonstrates the use of enums in C++:

```c++
enum class DayOfWeek {
  Monday,
  Tuesday,
  Wednesday,
  Thursday,
  Friday,
  Saturday,
  Sunday
};

int main() {
  DayOfWeek today = DayOfWeek::Monday;
  if (today == DayOfWeek::Monday) {
    // Do something specific for Monday
  }
  return 0;
}
```

This code defines an enum class called `DayOfWeek` with seven named constants representing the days of the week.  The `enum class` syntax introduces stronger type safety compared to traditional enums.
