近义词：coplanar, in the same plane | 反义词：non-coplanar


词源:  The word "coplanar" is derived from the prefix "co-" (meaning "together" or "jointly") and the words "plane" (a flat surface extending infinitely in all directions) and "-ar" (an adjectival suffix indicating "pertaining to" or "having the nature of").  Therefore, coplanar literally means "together in a plane".
