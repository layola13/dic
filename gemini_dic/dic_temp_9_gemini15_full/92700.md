The word "icei" is not a recognized word in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.  It's possible that:

* It's a misspelling: Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding word?
* It's a neologism or slang:  A newly coined word or a term used within a specific community.  If this is the case, please provide context for its use.
