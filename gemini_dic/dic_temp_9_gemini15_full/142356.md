orthomorphic:/ˌɔːrθoʊˈmɔːrfɪk/| adj. |正形的，等角的|Conformal; preserving angles.  In mathematics, particularly in map projections, an orthomorphic projection is one that preserves angles locally. This means that the angles between any two intersecting lines on the map are the same as the angles between the corresponding lines on the surface being mapped.  |例句：The Mercator projection is an example of an orthomorphic map projection.  墨卡托投影是正形地图投影的一个例子。

The Lambert conformal conic projection is another orthomorphic projection frequently used for mapping large areas.兰伯特等角圆锥投影是另一种常用于绘制大面积区域的正形投影。


近义词：conformal, isogonal|反义词：non-conformal, equiareal


词源:From Greek *orthos* ("straight," "right") + *morphe* ("form," "shape").  The term reflects the preservation of angles (right angles remaining right angles in the mapping).


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The map projection is orthomorphic. = 该地图投影是正形的。
This transformation preserves orthomorphism. = 此变换保持正形性。


一般过去时:
The cartographer used an orthomorphic projection. = 制图师使用了正形投影。
The angles were preserved because the projection was orthomorphic. = 角度得以保留，因为投影是正形的。


现在完成时:

虚拟语气:
If the projection were orthomorphic, the angles would be preserved. = 如果投影是正形的，则角度将被保留。
It would be ideal if we could find a perfectly orthomorphic projection for this area. = 如果我们能为该区域找到一个完美的正形投影，那就最好了。


被动语态:
An orthomorphic projection was used in the creation of this map. = 这张地图的制作使用了正形投影。
The angles are preserved because the transformation is orthomorphic. = 角度得以保留，因为变换是正形的。


疑问句:
