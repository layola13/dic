The word "exactingnesses" is the plural form of "exactingness," which itself is a noun derived from the adjective "exacting."

**Etymology:**

* **Exacting (adj.):**  Originates from the verb "exact," meaning "to demand" or "to require precisely."  The verb "exact" traces back to the Old French word "exacter," ultimately deriving from the Latin "exigere," meaning "to drive out," "to demand," or "to require."

* **Exactingness (n.):**  This noun is formed by adding the suffix "-ness," a common English suffix used to create nouns from adjectives, indicating a state, quality, or condition.  Thus, "exactingness" signifies the state or quality of being exacting.

* **Exactingnesses (n.):** This is simply the plural of "exactingness," referring to multiple instances or types of exacting demands or precision.


**Usage:**

The word "exactingnesses" is less common than "exactingness." It is used to emphasize the multiplicity or different facets of demanding precision or strict requirements.  Because it is a plural noun, it should be used when referring to more than one instance of exacting demands or precision.

For example:

The various exactingnesses of the project, from the tight deadlines to the meticulous detail requirements, proved to be overwhelming.  （项目的各种严苛要求，从紧迫的截止日期到细致的细节要求，都被证明是难以承受的。）

The multiple exactingnesses of her job left her feeling drained. (她工作的多重严苛要求让她感到精疲力尽。)


There is no specific grammatical tense associated with the word itself, as it is a noun. However, sentences using "exactingnesses" can be expressed in various tenses depending on the verb used in the sentence.  For instance:

* **Present Tense:**  The exactingnesses of the job are well known. (这份工作的严苛要求众所周知。)
* **Past Tense:** The exactingnesses of the task were underestimated. (这项任务的严苛要求被低估了。)
* **Future Tense:** The exactingnesses of the new regulations will be felt soon. (新规定的严苛要求很快就会被感受到。)


**Phrases:**

There aren't common idiomatic phrases directly using "exactingnesses," as it's a relatively uncommon word.  However, phrases using "exacting" or related words can be adapted:


* **The exacting demands of:**  (这项工作的严苛要求)
* **Under the exacting scrutiny of:** (在严格的审查下)
* **Meet the exacting standards of:** (达到严格的标准)
* **Subject to exacting rules:** (受严格规则约束)
