词源:
The word "overfastidious" is a combination of "over-" (meaning "excessively" or "too much") and "fastidious."  "Fastidious" comes from the Latin word "fastidiōsus," meaning "disdainful," "squeamish," or "difficult to please."  The evolution of the word shows a shift from a general sense of disdain to a more specific focus on meticulousness and being overly critical.
