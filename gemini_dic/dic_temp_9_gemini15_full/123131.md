monism: /ˈmɒnɪzəm/ | /ˈmɑːnɪzəm/ | n. | 一元论 | The philosophical view that there is only one substance or principle in the universe.  It contrasts with dualism and pluralism.  Monism can take many forms, depending on what that single substance or principle is considered to be. Examples include idealism (only mind exists), materialism (only matter exists), and neutral monism (a single substance that is neither mind nor matter). | Example:  Many physicists subscribe to a form of monism, believing that all phenomena are ultimately reducible to a single fundamental force.  许多物理学家都赞同某种一元论，认为所有现象最终都可以简化为单一的基本力。| 近义词:  unitarianism,  unity | 反义词: dualism, pluralism
