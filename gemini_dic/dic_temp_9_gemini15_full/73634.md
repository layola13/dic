词源:

The word "forfeitable" is derived from the verb "forfeit," which comes from the Old French word "forfaire," meaning "to do wrong," "to offend," or "to break faith."  The prefix "for-" implies a negation or deprivation, while "-faire" relates to doing or making.  The "-able" suffix transforms the verb into an adjective, signifying something capable of being forfeited.  The evolution of the word reflects its meaning of losing something due to wrongdoing or breach of contract.
