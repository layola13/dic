词源：

* **non-:**  prefix meaning "not"
* **feasibleness:**  from "feasible," which comes from the Old French *feasible* and ultimately from the Latin *facilis* ("easy to do").  "-ible" is a suffix forming adjectives meaning "capable of." "-ness" is a suffix forming nouns of state or quality.  Therefore, nonfeasibleness literally means "not easily doable-ness".
