enaliosauria:/ˌɛneɪliəˈsɔːriə/| n. |鳍龙类 |Enaliosauria is an extinct clade of mostly marine reptiles that lived during the Mesozoic Era. They were highly diverse, occupying various ecological niches in the oceans.  The group includes iconic creatures like plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and mosasaurs, though the exact phylogenetic relationships within Enaliosauria are still being debated by paleontologists. They are characterized by adaptations for aquatic life, such as streamlined bodies, flippers, and powerful tails. |The discovery of new enaliosaurian fossils continues to shed light on their evolution and diversity.  |近义词:marine reptiles(广义)|反义词: terrestrial reptiles
