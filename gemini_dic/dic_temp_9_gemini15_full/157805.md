placoderm:/ˈplækədɜːrm/| n. |盾皮鱼 |A placoderm is an extinct class of heavily armored jawed fishes that lived during the Devonian period (about 419 to 359 million years ago).  They were among the earliest known vertebrates with jaws. |The discovery of this placoderm fossil sheds new light on the evolution of early vertebrates.  这项盾皮鱼化石的发现为早期脊椎动物的进化提供了新的线索。|近义词: armored fish (though not a direct synonym as it's a broader term)|反义词:  (no direct antonym, as it refers to a specific extinct group)|
