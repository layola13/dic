The word "{sation}" is not a valid English word.  There is no word in standard English dictionaries that is spelled "{sation}". It's likely a misspelling or a fragment of a word.  To help you, I need the correct spelling of the word you intended.  For example, are you thinking of words like:

* **station:**  /ˈsteɪʃən/ | n. | 车站；电台；职位 | A place where vehicles stop regularly to pick up or set down passengers or goods; a broadcasting facility; a position or location. | Example: The train station is very busy. 火车站非常繁忙。| Near Synonyms: terminal, depot, post | Antonyms:  None directly, but depending on context, things like "movement," "journey" could be considered opposites.

* **satiation:** /ˌseɪʃiˈeɪʃən/ | n. | 饱足；满足 | The action or fact of satisfying a desire or need completely. | Example: He ate until satiation. 他吃到了饱。| Near Synonyms: satisfaction, fulfillment, repletion | Antonyms: hunger, deprivation, want


Please provide the correct spelling so I can give you a detailed analysis.
