词源:
Conveyancing derives from the verb "convey," meaning to transfer or transmit something, especially property.  The suffix "-ancing" denotes the act or process of doing something. Therefore, conveyancing literally means the act of conveying property.  Its roots lie in the Old French word "conveier" and ultimately the Latin "convehere," meaning "to carry together."
