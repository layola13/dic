词源:

* **quasi-**:  From Latin "quasi," meaning "as if," "as it were," or "almost."
* **irregularly**: From "irregular" (adjective), combining "ir-" (negative prefix) and "regular" (from Latin "regularis," meaning "according to rule").  "-ly" is an adverbial suffix.

The word combines the sense of "almost" or "approximately" with the concept of irregularity.  It's a relatively uncommon word, primarily used in scientific or technical contexts where a slight deviation from a regular pattern needs to be described.
