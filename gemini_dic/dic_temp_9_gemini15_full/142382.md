It contrasts with random genetic drift. | Example: Orthoselection is a key mechanism in adaptive evolution, leading to the development of traits well-suited to a particular niche. 正选择是适应性进化中的一个关键机制，导致了非常适合特定生态位的性状的发展。|近义词：directional selection, adaptive selection | 反义词：purifying selection, negative selection | 名词


USAGE->
This word is primarily used in the field of biology and genetics, so grammatical examples using the word itself are limited.  The word functions as a noun and is usually used in descriptive sentences or as the subject of a sentence discussing evolutionary processes.  Therefore, instead of demonstrating tense conjugations, here are examples of how to use "orthoselection" in different sentence structures:


Declarative Sentence:
Orthoselection drives the adaptation of species to their environments. = 正选择驱动物种对其环境的适应。

Interrogative Sentence:
Is orthoselection the primary mechanism behind the evolution of this particular trait? = 正选择是这种特定性状进化的主要机制吗？


Exclamatory Sentence:
The power of orthoselection in shaping biodiversity is remarkable! = 正选择在塑造生物多样性方面的作用是显著的！


Passive Voice:
The rapid evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is often attributed to orthoselection. = 细菌对抗生素抗性的快速进化通常归因于正选择。


Comparative Sentence:
Orthoselection is more effective at producing adaptations than genetic drift in stable environments. = 在稳定的环境中，正选择比遗传漂变更有效地产生适应性。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases directly using "orthoselection".  However, it is often used in conjunction with phrases like:

"evidence of orthoselection" = 正选择的证据
"mechanisms of orthoselection" = 正选择的机制
"the role of orthoselection" = 正选择的作用
"a case of orthoselection" = 正选择的一个案例
"orthoselection pressure" = 正选择压力


Note:  The provided examples illustrate the usage of the term "orthoselection" within the context of its definition and field of study.  Because it's a relatively specialized term,  verb conjugations or other grammatical structures wouldn't meaningfully apply in the same way as with more common words.
