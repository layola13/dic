USAGE->
The dative case is a grammatical concept, not a word with independent usage like "what."  It doesn't have tenses or voice in the way verbs do.  Instead, it describes the grammatical function of a noun or pronoun within a sentence.  The manifestation of the dative case varies across languages.  In some languages, it's marked by a specific case ending on the noun or pronoun.  In English, the dative case is often signaled by prepositions such as "to" or "for."


Examples illustrating the dative case in English:

Direct Object + Indirect Object:

He gave the book to his sister.  = 他把书给了他姐姐。(Sister is the indirect object, in the dative case)

She sent a postcard to her friend. = 她寄了一张明信片给她朋友。(Friend is the indirect object, in the dative case)

Prepositional Phrases Showing Dative Function:

I wrote a letter for my mother. = 我给我妈妈写了一封信。(Mother is the beneficiary, a dative function)

They prepared a meal for the guests. = 他们为客人准备了一顿饭。(Guests are the beneficiaries, a dative function)



PHRASE->
The dative case itself doesn't form phrases in the same way a verb or noun might.  However, phrases *containing* nouns or pronouns in the dative case are common.  Examples:


to him =给他
for her = 为她
to the children = 给孩子们
for my sake = 为了我
with them = 和他们


Word Origin:

From Latin *dativus*, from *dare* "to give".  This reflects the original function of the dative case in many Indo-European languages: indicating the recipient of something given.
