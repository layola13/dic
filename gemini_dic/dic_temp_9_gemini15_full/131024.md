英文解析:
Nonauthenticity refers to the quality or state of not being authentic; lacking genuineness or originality. It suggests something is fake, counterfeit, or not what it claims to be.  This can apply to various contexts, including art, documents, historical accounts, or even personal experiences.

词源:

The word is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the noun "authenticity."  Authenticity itself comes from the Latin word "authenticus," meaning "authoritative," derived from "auctor" (author).  Therefore, nonauthenticity literally means "not of authoritative origin" or "not genuine."
