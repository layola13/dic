词源:
The word "costar" is a combination of "co-" (meaning "together" or "jointly") and "star" (meaning a leading actor or performer).  It emerged as a natural extension of the existing term "star" to describe actors who share significant screen time and importance in a production, but are not necessarily the lead.
