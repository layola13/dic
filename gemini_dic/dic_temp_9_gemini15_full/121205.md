The word "mised" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a word from a very specialized or archaic context.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full analysis following the requested format.  To help, I need clarification:

* **Is it a misspelling?**  Could you possibly mean a different word?  If so, please provide the intended word.  Common possibilities include:
    * **missed:**  /mɪst/ | v. | 错过，想念 | To fail to catch or reach; to feel the absence of. | Example: I missed the bus. 我错过了公共汽车。 | Near synonyms: lost, overlooked | Antonyms: caught, attended
    * **mised (as a possible misspelling of "mixed"):** /mɪkst/ | v. | 混合，调配 | To combine or blend. | Example: She mixed the ingredients together. 她把配料混合在一起。 | Near synonyms: blended, combined | Antonyms: separated, unmixed


If "mised" is indeed a word from a specific field or a proper noun, please provide more context so I can assist you better.
