idioplasm: /ˈɪdiəʊˌplæzəm/ | n. | 本体质，遗传物质 | The inherent, heritable characteristics of an organism, distinct from its somatic characteristics.  It refers to the totality of factors that determine the organism's unique characteristics, passed down through generations. This term is largely obsolete in modern biology, having been superseded by more precise terminology related to genes and genomes. | Example:  The idioplasm of the plant determined its flower color and shape.  植物的本体质决定了它的花色和形状。| 近义词: germ plasm, genotype | 反义词: phenotype (somatoplasm)
