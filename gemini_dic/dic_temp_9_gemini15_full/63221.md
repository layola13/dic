The word "enteritides" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specialized or technical field.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.

To help you, I can suggest some possible correct spellings or related terms depending on what you intended to write:


* **Enteritis:** This is a common medical term referring to inflammation of the intestines.  I can provide information on this word if this is what you meant.

Please clarify the intended word, and I will be happy to provide the requested analysis.
