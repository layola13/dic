dactylozooid:/dækˈtɪləzoʊɪd/| n. |指状体，指状个体|A dactylozooid is a type of polyp in certain hydrozoan colonies, specialized for defense or prey capture.  They are typically small, slender, and have tentacles armed with nematocysts (stinging cells).|Example: The hydroid colony displayed numerous dactylozooids poised to capture passing plankton.|近义词：polyps (in a broader sense) |反义词：gastrozooid (feeding polyp)


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The colony displays many dactylozooids. =  群体显示许多指状体。
Dactylozooids capture prey efficiently. = 指状体有效地捕获猎物。

一般过去时:
The researchers observed several dactylozooids. = 研究人员观察到几个指状体。
The dactylozooids retracted their tentacles. = 指状体缩回了触手。

现在完成时:
Scientists have studied dactylozooids extensively. = 科学家们已经广泛研究了指状体。
The colony has developed numerous dactylozooids for defense. = 群体已经发展出许多用于防御的指状体。

过去完成时:
The dactylozooids had already captured the prey before the gastrozooids arrived. = 在胃状体到达之前，指状体已经捕获了猎物。
Before the observation, the scientists had not seen such large dactylozooids. = 在观察之前，科学家们没有见过这么大的指状体。

将来时:
The researchers will examine the dactylozooids under a microscope. = 研究人员将在显微镜下检查指状体。
We will observe how the dactylozooids respond to stimuli. = 我们将观察指状体如何对刺激做出反应。

虚拟语气:
If the dactylozooids were larger, they could capture bigger prey. = 如果指状体更大，它们就能捕获更大的猎物。
I wish I had observed the dactylozooids more closely. = 我希望我更仔细地观察了指状体。

被动语态:
The dactylozooids were observed using a high-powered microscope. = 指状体是用高倍显微镜观察到的。
The function of the dactylozooids is still being investigated. = 指状体的功能仍在研究中。

疑问句:
What is the role of the dactylozooids in the colony? = 指状体在群体中的作用是什么？
How many dactylozooids are present in this sample? = 这个样本中有多少指状体？

否定句:
The colony did not have many dactylozooids. = 该群体没有很多指状体。
The dactylozooids were not effective at capturing the large prey. = 指状体在捕获大型猎物方面并不有效。


PHRASE->
dactylozooid morphology = 指状体形态
dactylozooid development = 指状体发育
dactylozooid function = 指状体功能
dactylozooid structure = 指状体结构
dactylozooid distribution = 指状体分布
