semi-invariant:/ˌsɛmiˈɪnveəriənt/| adj.|半不变量，半不变式|A semi-invariant is a quantity that remains unchanged under certain transformations, but not all.  It is a weaker form of invariance. In mathematics, particularly in statistics and group theory, semi-invariants appear in various contexts where complete invariance is not required or possible. For example, in the context of moments, a semi-invariant might be a quantity that is invariant under certain shifts or scalings of the data.|The central moments of a distribution are semi-invariants under translation, meaning they remain unchanged when a constant is added to all data points.  However, they are not invariant under scaling.|近义词：partially invariant|反义词：invariant, variant


USAGE->
There is no common usage of "semi-invariant" in everyday conversational English.  Its usage is primarily within the context of advanced mathematics and statistics.  Therefore, examples illustrating grammatical tenses and moods are not applicable in a general sense.  Examples are better suited to demonstrating its mathematical application.

Example 1 (Mathematical Context):

The cumulants of a probability distribution are semi-invariants under changes of location. = 概率分布的累积量在位置变化下是半不变量。


Example 2 (Mathematical Context):

Under linear transformations, the central moments are not invariant, but are instead semi-invariant. = 在线性变换下，中心矩不是不变的，而是半不变的。



PHRASE->
There are no common phrases specifically using "semi-invariant".  The term is highly specialized.
