词源:
The word "discombobulating" is a relatively recent addition to the English language, appearing in the 20th century.  It's a humorous and informal word formed by combining the prefix "dis-" (meaning "not" or "opposite of") with "combobulate," which itself is a humorous and non-standard word of uncertain origin.  Some speculate it might be a playful alteration of words like "combustive" or "combine," suggesting a sense of being thrown into disarray or mixed up.  While there's no definitive etymological record for "combobulate," its use alongside "dis-" clearly creates a word signifying a state of confusion and disorientation.
