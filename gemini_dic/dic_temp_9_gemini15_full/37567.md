词源:
The word "commotive" derives from the Latin word "commovēre," which means "to move together," "to disturb," or "to excite."  The prefix "com-" indicates "together," and "movēre" is the root meaning "to move."  Thus, "commotive" literally signifies something that moves or stirs up many people together, leading to unrest or agitation.
