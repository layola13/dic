pseudopotential:/ˌsuːdoʊpəˈtɛnʃəl/| n. |赝势|A pseudopotential is a simplified potential used in physics and chemistry, particularly in electronic structure calculations, that mimics the effect of a real potential while being computationally less expensive.  It replaces the strong, rapidly varying potential near the nucleus of an atom with a weaker, smoother potential. This simplification allows for faster calculations without sacrificing much accuracy in predicting the valence electron properties, which are crucial for many physical and chemical properties of materials. | Example:  Researchers used a pseudopotential to model the electronic structure of silicon.  研究人员使用赝势来模拟硅的电子结构。|近义词: effective potential, model potential |反义词: real potential
