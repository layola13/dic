The word is formed by combining the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") with the noun "thinkings" (plural of "thinking," referring to thoughts or acts of thinking).  Therefore, it literally means "not thinkings."  The word is relatively uncommon and may be considered a neologism (newly coined word) or a less common usage depending on context.
