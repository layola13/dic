词源:

The word "experientialist" is derived from "experiential," which itself comes from "experience" + "-ial" (adjective-forming suffix) + "-ist" (noun-forming suffix indicating a person or adherent to a belief).  The root "experience" traces back to Old French "experience," ultimately from Latin "experientia," meaning "trial, proof, experience."
