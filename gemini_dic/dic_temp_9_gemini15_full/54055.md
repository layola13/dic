词源:

The word "disdaining" comes from the Old French word *desdaigner*, which itself derives from the Latin *dis dignari*, meaning "to deem unworthy".  The prefix "dis-" means "apart" or "not," and "dignari" means "to deem worthy."  Therefore, the original meaning points to considering something or someone as not worthy of respect or attention.
