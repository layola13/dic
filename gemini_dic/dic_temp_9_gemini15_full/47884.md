decemlocular: /ˌdɛsɪmˈlɒkjʊlər/ | adj. | 十眼的；具有十个眼睛的 | Having ten eyes.  This word is a rare and largely artificial construction, primarily found in specialized contexts or fictional works. It combines the Latin prefix "decem-" (ten) with the Latin root "-ocular" (related to eyes).  There are no common synonyms or antonyms as the word itself is uncommon.
