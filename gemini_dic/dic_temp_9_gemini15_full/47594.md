词源:
The word "debatement" is derived from the Old French word "debat," meaning "dispute" or "struggle," which in turn comes from the Latin word "battuere," meaning "to beat" or "to fight." The suffix "-ment" is a noun-forming suffix that indicates the action or result of the verb.  Therefore, "debatement" literally means "the act of disputing or debating."
