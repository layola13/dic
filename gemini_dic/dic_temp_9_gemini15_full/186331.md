rhotic:/ˈroʊtɪk/|/ˈrɒtɪk/| adj. |卷舌的；（指元音）后跟/r/的|  Referring to a dialect or accent in which the /r/ sound is pronounced after a vowel, even when it is not followed by another vowel.  This contrasts with non-rhotic accents, where the /r/ is silent in such positions. | Example:  General American English is a rhotic accent, while Received Pronunciation (RP) British English is generally non-rhotic.  In rhotic accents, words like "car" and "mother" have a pronounced /r/ sound at the end. In non-rhotic accents, the /r/ is silent, or at least very much reduced. |近义词: r-ful |反义词: non-rhotic
