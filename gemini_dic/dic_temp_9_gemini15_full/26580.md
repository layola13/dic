词源:The word "cabotage" comes from the Old French word "cabotaige," which ultimately derives from the Catalan word "cap de flota," meaning "head of the fleet."  This refers to the practice of coastal trade and the ships involved.  The term evolved to encompass not only sea transport but also air transport within a country's boundaries.
