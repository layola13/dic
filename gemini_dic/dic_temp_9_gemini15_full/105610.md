kinematics:/ˌkɪnəˈmætɪks/| n. | 运动学 | The branch of mechanics concerned with the motion of objects without considering the forces that cause the motion.  It deals with the description of motion, including displacement, velocity, acceleration, and their relationships over time. | Example:  Kinematics is fundamental to understanding how projectiles move through the air. 运动学是理解抛射物如何在空中运动的基础。

The study of kinematics often involves analyzing the motion of rigid bodies, which are objects that maintain their shape and size during motion.  It also extends to the analysis of deformable bodies, though this is more complex.  Kinematics is a crucial component of many engineering and physics disciplines. |近义词：dynamics (but focuses on forces), motion study |反义词：statics (study of objects at rest)
