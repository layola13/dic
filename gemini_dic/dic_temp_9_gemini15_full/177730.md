recaptor:/rɪˈsɛptər/| n. |受体，感受器|A receptor is a protein that receives and reacts to a specific chemical signal, such as a neurotransmitter or hormone.  It is a molecule on the surface of a cell or within a cell that binds to a specific substance (a ligand) and initiates a cellular response.|例句：Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic neuron. 神经递质与突触后神经元的受体结合。|例句：The cell surface receptors play a crucial role in cell signaling. 细胞表面受体在细胞信号传导中起着至关重要的作用。|近义词：sensor, detector |反义词：effector


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The receptor binds to the ligand. = 受体与配体结合。
This receptor mediates cell growth. = 此受体介导细胞生长。


一般过去时:
The researchers identified a new receptor. = 研究人员发现了一种新的受体。
The drug blocked the receptor. = 该药物阻断了受体。


现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered many different types of receptors. = 科学家们已经发现了许多不同类型的受体。
We have studied the receptor's function extensively. = 我们已经广泛研究了受体的功能。


过去完成时:
They had already activated the receptor before the experiment began. = 实验开始前，他们已经激活了受体。
The cell had down-regulated the receptor in response to the stimulus. = 细胞响应刺激已下调受体。


将来时:
We will test the effectiveness of the new receptor. = 我们将测试新型受体的有效性。
Researchers will investigate the receptor's role in disease. = 研究人员将调查受体在疾病中的作用。


虚拟语气:
If the receptor were mutated, the signal transduction would be impaired. = 如果受体发生突变，信号转导就会受损。
It is essential that the receptor maintain its structure for proper function. = 受体必须保持其结构才能正常发挥功能。


被动语态:
The receptor was activated by the ligand. = 受体被配体激活。
The signal was transduced after the receptor was bound. = 受体结合后，信号被转导。


疑问句:
What type of receptor is this? = 这是什么类型的受体？
Where is the receptor located on the cell? = 受体位于细胞的哪个部位？


否定句:
The drug did not bind to the receptor. = 该药物没有与受体结合。
This receptor does not respond to that ligand. = 此受体不响应该配体。


PHRASE->
receptor binding = 受体结合
receptor activation = 受体激活
receptor signaling = 受体信号传导
receptor downregulation = 受体下调
receptor tyrosine kinase = 受体酪氨酸激酶
