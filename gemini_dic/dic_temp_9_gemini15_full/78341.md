词源：The word "gerund" comes from the Latin word "gerundium," which is a participle used as a noun.  The Latin word itself is derived from "gerere," meaning "to carry," "to bear," or "to do."  This reflects the gerund's function of carrying or performing a verbal action while holding a noun-like role in the sentence.
