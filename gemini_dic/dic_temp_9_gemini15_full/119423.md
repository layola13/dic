microglia:/maɪˈkrɒɡliə/| n. |小胶质细胞|Microglia are specialized immune cells residing in the central nervous system (CNS), acting as the first and main form of active immune defense in the brain and spinal cord. They constantly survey their environment for pathogens, damaged cells, and other threats.  When they detect these threats, they become activated, migrating to the site of injury or infection and releasing various substances to eliminate the threat.  This process is crucial for maintaining the health and function of the CNS.  |Example:  Studies have shown that microglia play a critical role in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease.  研究表明，小胶质细胞在阿尔茨海默病的发展和进展中起着关键作用。|近义词：glial cell (a broader term)|反义词：N/A
