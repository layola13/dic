词源:
The word "premortifying" is a relatively recent coinage. It combines the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before" or "in anticipation of") with "mortifying," which comes from the Latin word "mortificare" (to subdue, deaden, or humiliate).  Therefore, "premortifying" describes something that causes the anticipation of intense embarrassment or humiliation before it even happens.
