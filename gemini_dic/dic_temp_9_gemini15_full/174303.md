The word "quey" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  It might be a misspelling of another word.  Could you please double-check the spelling or provide more context where you encountered this word?

2. **It's a proper noun:** It could be a proper noun (a name of a person, place, or thing), in which case it wouldn't have a standard dictionary definition.

3. **It's slang or jargon:** It might be slang or jargon used within a specific community or field.  Providing more context would be helpful.

4. **It's a newly coined word:**  It's possible the word is very new and hasn't yet made it into dictionaries.
