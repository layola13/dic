The word "duding" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a slang term, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word specific to a particular dialect or community.  Therefore, a full etymological and usage analysis is impossible.  To provide a helpful response, more context is needed.  Where did you encounter this word?  What was the surrounding text or conversation?
