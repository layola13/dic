词源:

The word "calends" comes from the Latin word "kalendae," which was the name given to the first day of the month in the ancient Roman calendar.  The term ultimately derives from the Proto-Italic word *kal- (meaning "to call" or "proclaim").  The first day was so named because it was the day on which announcements and pronouncements were made, including debt payment reminders.


用法说明:

由于"calends" 指的是古罗马历法中的第一天，其用法主要限于历史、考古学或古典文学的语境中。  它很少在现代英语中使用。
