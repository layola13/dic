diradiation:/ˌdaɪrˌeɪdiˈeɪʃən/| n. |辐射扩散，辐射分布|The spreading of radiation from a central point.  This term is less common than other terms describing radiation spread, such as diffusion or dispersion.  It often refers to the distribution of radiation across a surface or volume.|例句：The diradiation of sunlight across the landscape was responsible for the uneven heating of the ground.  阳光在景观中的辐射扩散导致地面受热不均。|近义词：irradiation, radiation distribution, dispersion, diffusion|反义词：concentration, focusing
