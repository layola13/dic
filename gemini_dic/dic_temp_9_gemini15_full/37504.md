词源:
From French *commode*, from Old French *commode*, from Latin *commodus* ("convenient, suitable").  The original meaning referred to a piece of furniture that was convenient or suitable for various uses.  The evolution of meaning to include toilets reflects a shift in usage, where such a piece of furniture became specifically associated with the function of a toilet.
