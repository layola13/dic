loxodromy:/ˈlɒksədrəmi/| n. |斜航线，恒向线|A rhumb line; a line on the surface of the sphere that crosses all meridians at the same angle.  It is a path of constant bearing, unlike a great-circle route which is the shortest distance between two points.  Loxodromes are useful in navigation because they maintain a constant compass heading.|The ship followed a loxodromy across the ocean.|近义词：rhumb line|反义词：great-circle route
