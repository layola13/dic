dereferencer: /ˌdiːˈrefərənsər/ | n. | 解引用器 | A dereferencer is a mechanism or component in a programming language or system that retrieves the value stored at a memory address represented by a pointer or reference.  It essentially "dereferences" the pointer, accessing the data it points to.  This is a crucial operation in many programming paradigms, including those using pointers extensively. | Example: In C++, the asterisk (*) operator acts as a dereferencer when used with pointers.  `int *ptr = &value;  int x = *ptr;`  This code declares a pointer `ptr`, assigns it the memory address of `value`, and then dereferences `ptr` to assign its value to `x`.  |近义词: pointer accessor, reference resolver | 反义词:  (no direct antonym, the opposite action would be to create a pointer without accessing the data) | n.
