The word "olibene" is not found in standard English dictionaries or etymology resources.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It might be:

1. **A misspelling:**  Could you double-check the spelling?  Perhaps you meant a similar-sounding or -looking word?

2. **A neologism:** A newly coined word, perhaps specific to a certain field or community.  If this is the case, more context is needed (where did you encounter this word?).

3. **A proper noun:** It could be a name (person, place, or thing). Again, context would be helpful.

4. **A word from another language:**  It might be a word borrowed from another language without common usage in English.  If so, please specify the language.


Without more information, I cannot provide the requested analysis. Please provide context or correct the spelling.
