The word "oughne" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information following the requested format.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very obscure dialect.
