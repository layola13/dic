nondesecrations: /ˌnɒnˌdesɪˈkreɪʃənz/ | n. |非亵渎；不神圣化；未被亵渎的事物 |  The word "nondesecrations" is not a standard English word. It's a neologism, likely formed by combining "non-" (meaning "not") and "desecrations" (the act of violating a sacred place or thing).  It implies a lack of desecration or something that has not been treated irreverently. There are no standard dictionary definitions or common usage examples.  The word would need context to understand its intended meaning. | Example: (Hypothetical) In the context of a discussion about ancient artifacts, one might say,  "The museum curator ensured the nondesecrations of the relics." (This implies the relics were kept safe and treated with respect).|近义词:  preservation, protection, safeguarding |反义词: desecration, profanation, violation |名词
