词源:  The word "prelibation" is a modern coinage, combining the prefix "pre-" (meaning "before") with "libation," which ultimately derives from the Latin word "libatio" (a pouring out, especially of a drink as an offering).  Therefore, a prelibation is literally a "before-pouring-out,"  referring to a drink taken before a more significant event or meal.
