词源:

The word "neglectfulness" is derived from the verb "neglect" + the suffix "-fulness".  "Neglect" itself comes from the Old French "negligere" (to disregard, neglect), which in turn is from the Latin "negligere" (to disregard, neglect), formed from "nec" (not) + "ligere" (to gather, choose).  The suffix "-fulness" indicates the state or quality of being.
