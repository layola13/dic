词源:  The word is a compound of "pseudo-" (meaning false or imitation) and "Bohemian," referring to the unconventional lifestyle associated with the artistic and intellectual communities of Bohemia (a historical region in Central Europe).  The term "Bohemian" itself derives from the name of the region and its association with artistic freedom and nonconformity.
