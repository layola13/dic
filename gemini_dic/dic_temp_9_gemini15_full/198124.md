The word "shopen" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to the requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a proper noun (like a name or place), or a word from a very specialized or non-standard dialect.  To provide the analysis you requested, I need a valid English word.
