词源:

* **re-**: prefix meaning "again" or "back"
* **appraisal**: from Old French *apriser*,  meaning "to appraise, estimate the value of".  Ultimately derived from Latin *appreciare*  ("to estimate the value of").


The word "reappraisal" thus literally means "to appraise again".  The 's indicates possessive case, showing that something belongs to or is associated with the reappraisal.
