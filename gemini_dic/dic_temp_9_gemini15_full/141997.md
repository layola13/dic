词源:

The word "organised" comes from the verb "organise" (or "organize" in American English), which itself originates from the Greek word "organon," meaning "tool" or "instrument."  The sense of arrangement and structure developed from the idea of using tools and instruments to achieve a specific purpose.  The suffix "-ised"/-ized" indicates the past participle form, signifying a state of being organised.
