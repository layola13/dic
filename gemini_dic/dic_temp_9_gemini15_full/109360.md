词源:
The word "leno" derives from the Italian word "leno," meaning "fine linen."  However, the modern usage refers to a stronger, coarser fabric than fine linen, often involving a specific type of weave.  The Italian word itself likely has origins in Latin or even earlier Indo-European roots related to flax or linen production.
