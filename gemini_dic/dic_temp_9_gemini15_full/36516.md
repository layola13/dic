colider:/ˈkɔːlaɪdər/ | n. |对撞机| A collider is a machine that accelerates charged particles to very high speeds and then forces them to collide.  This collision creates new particles and allows scientists to study the fundamental building blocks of matter.  |Example: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the world's largest and most powerful particle collider.|近义词：accelerator (in this context)|反义词：None.


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The collider accelerates particles to near light speed. = 对撞机将粒子加速到接近光速。
Scientists use the collider to study subatomic particles. = 科学家们利用对撞机研究亚原子粒子。

一般过去时:
The collider produced some unexpected results. = 对撞机产生了一些意想不到的结果。
Researchers analyzed data from the collider experiment. = 研究人员分析了对撞机实验的数据。

现在完成时:
Scientists have discovered new particles using the collider. = 科学家们利用对撞机发现了新的粒子。
The collider has been upgraded several times. = 对撞机已经升级过几次了。

过去完成时:
Before the experiment, they had calibrated the collider precisely. = 在实验之前，他们已经精确地校准了对撞机。
The data analysis had already begun before the collider shut down. = 在对撞机关闭之前，数据分析就已经开始了。

将来时:
The collider will continue to operate for many years. = 对撞机将继续运行许多年。
They will use the collider to search for dark matter. = 他们将利用对撞机来寻找暗物质。

虚拟语气:
If the collider had worked better, we would have seen different results. = 如果对撞机运行得更好，我们会看到不同的结果。
It is important that the collider be maintained properly. = 对撞机必须得到妥善维护。

被动语态:
The particles are accelerated by the collider. = 粒子由对撞机加速。
The experiment was conducted using the collider. = 实验是使用对撞机进行的。

疑问句:
What kind of particles does the collider accelerate? = 对撞机加速什么类型的粒子？
How powerful is the collider? = 对撞机有多强大？

否定句:
The collider didn't function properly yesterday. = 对撞机昨天运行不正常。
They haven't yet analyzed all the data from the collider. = 他们还没有分析对撞机的所有数据。


PHRASE->
particle collider = 粒子对撞机
hadron collider = 强子对撞机
electron-positron collider = 电子正电子对撞机
linear collider = 线性对撞机
collider ring = 对撞环
