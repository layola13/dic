The word "inwork" does not exist as a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a phonetic transcription, grammatical classification, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc., following the requested format.  It's likely a misspelling, a newly coined term (neologism) with limited usage, or a term specific to a particular field or jargon.  If you could provide context where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer a better understanding of its intended meaning.
