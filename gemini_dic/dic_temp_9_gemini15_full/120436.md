词源:
The name "Minneapolis" is derived from the Dakota word "Mní Sóta Makočé," meaning "the city of the minnesota."  The name was created by combining the Greek word "polis" (city) with the Dakota word "mini" (water).  It's a somewhat artificial creation combining Greek and Dakota elements to create a name that reflects both the city's location and its European settlement.
