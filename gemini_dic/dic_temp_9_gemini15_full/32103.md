The word "chesteyn" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's possible:

1. **It's a misspelling:**  Could you be thinking of another word?  Perhaps a proper noun (a name or place), or a word with a similar spelling?  Providing more context (where you encountered this word) would be helpful.

2. **It's a dialect word or archaic word:** It might be a word used in a specific region or a very old word no longer in common use.  Again, context is crucial.

3. **It's a neologism or invented word:** Someone might have created this word for a specific purpose (e.g., in fiction, a game, or as a technical term).

4. **It's a foreign word:** It could be a word borrowed from another language. If so, specifying the language would aid identification.


Because "chesteyn" is not a recognized English word, I cannot provide the requested analysis including pronunciation, word class, definition, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, etc. Please provide more information about the context in which you found this word.
