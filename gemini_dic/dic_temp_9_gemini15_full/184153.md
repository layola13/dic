The word "resites" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need to consider possible intended words.  Is it perhaps one of the following?


* **Resits:**  This is the most likely intended word.

* **Resists:** This is another possibility, depending on context.
