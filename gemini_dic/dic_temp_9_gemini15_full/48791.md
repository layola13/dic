deflections:/dɪˈflɛkʃənz/| n.|偏转；挠度；偏差|The changes in direction or position, often slight;  a turning aside from a straight course.|例句：The deflections of the needle indicated a change in the magnetic field. 指针的偏转表明磁场发生了变化。

例句：The engineer calculated the deflections of the bridge under heavy load. 工程师计算了桥梁在重载下的挠度。


近义词：deviation, divergence, deflection, displacement, aberration|反义词：straightness, alignment|词性:名词


词源:  From Middle English *defleccion, from Old French defleccion, from Latin deflectere (to turn aside), from de- (away) + flectere (to bend).


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The needle shows small deflections. = 指针显示微小的偏转。
These measurements reveal significant deflections. = 这些测量结果显示出明显的偏差。


一般过去时:
The beam experienced large deflections during the test. = 梁在测试过程中经历了大的挠度。
Strong winds caused noticeable deflections in the power lines. = 强风导致电力线出现明显的偏转。


现在完成时:
The bridge has shown considerable deflections over the years. = 这座桥多年来已经显示出相当大的挠度。
The experiment has yielded unexpected deflections. = 实验产生了意想不到的偏差。


过去完成时:
The structure had already experienced significant deflections before the collapse. = 结构在倒塌之前就已经经历了明显的挠度。
The satellite had undergone several course deflections before reaching its orbit. = 卫星在到达轨道之前已经进行了几次航向偏转。


将来时:
The new design will minimize deflections under stress. = 新的设计将在压力下最大限度地减少挠度。
The engineers predict that the tower will exhibit minimal deflections. = 工程师预测塔楼将表现出最小的偏转。


虚拟语气:
If the deflections were larger, the structure would be unstable. = 如果偏转更大，结构将不稳定。
If the deflections had been greater, we would have noticed sooner. = 如果偏转更大，我们会更早注意到。


被动语态:
The deflections were measured using a sensitive instrument. = 偏转是用灵敏仪器测量的。
The data are analyzed to determine the deflections. = 数据被分析以确定挠度。


疑问句:
What are the typical deflections for this material? = 这种材料的典型挠度是多少？
How significant are the measured deflections? = 测得的偏转有多大？


否定句:
The structure showed no significant deflections. = 结构没有显示出明显的挠度。
There were no noticeable deflections in the experimental results. = 实验结果没有明显的偏差。


PHRASE->
beam deflections = 梁的挠度
structural deflections = 结构挠度
deflection angle = 偏转角
deflection limit = 挠度极限
maximum deflection = 最大挠度
