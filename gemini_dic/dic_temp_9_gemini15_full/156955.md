词源:  From "pilgrim" + "-atic,"  The word "pilgrim" itself derives from the Old French "pelegrim" and ultimately from the Latin "peregrinus," meaning "foreigner" or "stranger."  The suffix "-atic" forms adjectives.  Therefore, "pilgrimatic" literally means "relating to a foreigner's journey," although its modern usage is strongly associated with religious pilgrimage.
