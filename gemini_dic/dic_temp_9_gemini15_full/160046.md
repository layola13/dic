polytomy:/pɒˈlɪtəmi/ | /pɑːˈlɪtəmi/ | n. |多分支; 多系发生; 多歧聚合|A polytomy in phylogenetics is a node in a phylogenetic tree that depicts an evolutionary relationship where more than two lineages diverge at the same time.  It represents uncertainty in the evolutionary relationships among several species.  A polytomy can be due to insufficient data to resolve the branching order, or it may reflect a true simultaneous divergence of multiple lineages (a hard polytomy).|


例句：

The phylogenetic tree showed a polytomy among three species, indicating that their evolutionary relationships are uncertain.  = 系统发育树显示三个物种之间存在多分支，表明它们之间的进化关系是不确定的。

The researchers resolved the polytomy by incorporating additional genetic data. = 研究人员通过加入额外的遗传数据解决了多分支问题。
