USAGE->
This word is primarily used in specific contexts, notably philosophy (especially Leibnizian metaphysics) and functional programming in computer science.  Therefore, providing extensive grammatical examples like those for a common word like "what" is not applicable.  Instead, I will provide examples showcasing its usage in these fields.

Philosophy:
"Leibniz's monadology presents a monadical view of reality, where each monad is a self-contained, indivisible unit." = “莱布尼茨的单子论提出了对现实的单子观点，其中每个单子都是一个自包含的、不可分割的单元。”

"His philosophical system is fundamentally monadical, rejecting any notion of external relations between substances." = “他的哲学体系从根本上说是单子的，拒绝任何关于物质之间外部关系的概念。”


Computer Science:
"The monadical design pattern in Haskell allows for elegant composition of functions." = “Haskell 中的单子设计模式允许函数的优雅组合。”

"Understanding monads is crucial for mastering functional programming paradigms." = “理解单子对于掌握函数式编程范式至关重要。”


PHRASE->
There are not common idiomatic phrases using "monadical."  The word is used primarily as a technical term.  Instead, here are some related terms often used in conjunction with "monadical":

monadical computation
monadical function
monadical structure
monadical category
monadical transformation
