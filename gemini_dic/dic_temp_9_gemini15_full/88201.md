The word "hims" does not exist as a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a very specific dialect or context not widely recognized.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.
