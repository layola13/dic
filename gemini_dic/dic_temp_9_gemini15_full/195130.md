semicrystalline:/ˌsemiˈkrɪstəlɪn/| adj.|半结晶的|Semi-crystalline materials possess a structure that is partly crystalline and partly amorphous.  This means they contain regions of ordered molecular arrangement (crystals) interspersed with regions of disordered arrangement (amorphous). The properties of a semi-crystalline material are a balance between the properties of its crystalline and amorphous phases.  Examples include many polymers, like polyethylene and polypropylene.|The plastic bottle is made of a semicrystalline polymer.|近义词：partially crystalline|反义词：amorphous, fully crystalline
