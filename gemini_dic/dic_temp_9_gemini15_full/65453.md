The word "eurhipidurous" is not a recognized word in English.  There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries or etymology resources.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), or a word from a fictional language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis following the requested format.
