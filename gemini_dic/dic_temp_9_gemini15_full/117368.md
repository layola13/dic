/ˌmiːdiˈeɪtənəsɪz/ | n. | 中介性；调停性质；中间状态 | The word "mediatenesses" is not a standard English word.  It's a possible but highly unusual formation, attempting to create a plural noun form suggesting multiple instances of mediation or mediating qualities.  It's grammatically incorrect to simply add "-nesses" to "mediate."  To express the idea of multiple instances of mediation, one would use phrases like "various mediations," "multiple acts of mediation," or "different mediating factors." |  There are no standard examples as the word is not established. A possible contrived example would be:  "The peace talks explored the various mediatenesses involved in the conflict resolution." (This sentence is grammatically questionable and unnatural.) |  mediation, arbitration, intervention |  direct confrontation, unilateral action |  n.
