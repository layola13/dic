词源: The word "douchebag" originates from the word "douche," which refers to a vaginal or anal irrigation device.  The addition of "bag" likely serves to further emphasize the negativity and unpleasantness associated with the term.  The pejorative use of "douchebag" emerged as a slang term in the late 20th century.  Its use is primarily focused on negative character traits and behavior, rather than the literal meaning of its component words.
