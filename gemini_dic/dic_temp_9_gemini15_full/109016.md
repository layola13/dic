词源:
The word "leftover" is a compound word combining "left" (remaining) and "over" (remaining, exceeding).  It emerged in the late 19th century as a natural combination reflecting the common usage of "left over" (two words) to describe remaining things.  The single-word form "leftover" developed as a more concise and convenient way to express the same idea.
