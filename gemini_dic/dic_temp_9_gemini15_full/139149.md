词源:
obeyingly is derived from the verb "obey" + the adverbial suffix "-ingly".  "Obey" itself has origins in Old French "obeir" and ultimately from Latin "obēdīre," meaning "to obey, listen to."  The "-ingly" suffix transforms the adjective "obeying" into an adverb, indicating the manner in which the action is performed.
