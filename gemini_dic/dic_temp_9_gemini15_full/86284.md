词源:  The term is a compound adjective, combining "heavy" (meaning significant weight or force) and "duty" (referring to a task or function). The phrase originally described equipment built to handle heavy workloads, but its meaning has broadened to encompass any item designed for intense, prolonged use.  The "duty" in this context refers to the amount of work or stress the item is expected to endure.
