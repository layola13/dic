词源:  The word "enticing" comes from the verb "entice," which is derived from the Old French word "enticier," meaning "to allure" or "to tempt."  This, in turn, has roots in the Latin word "inducere," meaning "to lead in" or "to induce."  The suffix "-ing" transforms the verb into its adjectival form.
