词源:
The word "coxswain" comes from the older word "coxon," which was a shortened version of "cockswain."  "Cock" here referred to a small boat, and "swain" meant a servant or attendant.  Therefore, a coxswain was originally the servant who steered a small boat. Over time, the word evolved to encompass the role of steering larger vessels, particularly racing shells.
