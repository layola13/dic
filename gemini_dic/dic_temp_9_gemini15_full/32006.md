The word "chenod" is not a standard English word.  Therefore, I cannot provide a phonetic transcription, definition, etymology, usage examples, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical information as requested.  A word like this might be:

* **A misspelling:**  Perhaps you meant a different word.  Could you double-check the spelling?
* **A neologism:** A newly coined word not yet in common usage.
* **A technical term:**  Specific to a certain field (e.g., scientific, medical).
* **A proper noun:** A name, possibly misspelled.


If you can provide more context or clarify the spelling, I may be able to help.
