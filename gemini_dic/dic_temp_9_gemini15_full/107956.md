词源:  The word "lascious" comes from the Old French word "lascif," meaning "lustful" or "lecherous."  This, in turn, derived from the Latin word "lascivus," which also meant "lustful" or "wanton."  The root is likely related to the Proto-Indo-European root "*leik-", meaning "to lick" or "to play," hinting at a playful or sensual connotation.
