词源:
The word is a combination of "locked" (past participle of the verb "to lock," from Old English *luc, meaning "lock, bolt") and "up," an adverb indicating a position or state of being enclosed or confined.  The "up" adds emphasis to the completeness of the locking action and the state of confinement.
