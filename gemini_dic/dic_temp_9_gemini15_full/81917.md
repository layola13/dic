词源:

The word "grille" comes from the Old French word "grille," meaning "lattice," "grating," or "grill."  This, in turn, derives from the Latin word "cratis," meaning "wickerwork," "hurdle," or "lattice."  The evolution reflects the use of various materials – initially wicker, then metal – in creating these structures.
