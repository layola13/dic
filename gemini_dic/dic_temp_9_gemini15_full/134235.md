USAGE->
This word is quite complex and uncommon.  Its usage would be highly specialized, likely within scientific or technical contexts.  Therefore, providing example sentences across various grammatical tenses would be artificial and unhelpful.  The word itself is a plural noun and would require a contextually appropriate verb.

Example Sentence:

The researchers observed several unexpected noninertnesses during the experiment.  研究人员在实验中观察到一些意想不到的非惰性现象。


PHRASE->
There are no common phrases using "noninertnesses".  The word is too specialized for common phrasal usage.
