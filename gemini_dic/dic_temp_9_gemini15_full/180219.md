WORD ORIGIN->

The word "refractedly" is derived from the verb "refract," which comes from the Latin word "refractus," the past participle of "refractare," meaning "to break." The suffix "-ly" transforms the adjective "refracted" into an adverb.  The root meaning points to the bending or breaking of light waves.
