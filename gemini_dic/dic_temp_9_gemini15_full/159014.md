Plymouth is a proper noun referring to several places, most notably:

* **Plymouth, England:** A major port city in Devon, England. It is historically significant as the departure point of the Mayflower in 1620, carrying the Pilgrims to the New World.

* **Plymouth, Massachusetts:** A city in Plymouth County, Massachusetts, USA.  It is also historically significant as the site of the Pilgrims' first settlement in North America.

The name "Plymouth" originates from the English town of Plymouth.  The name is derived from the Old English "Plym" (the river Plym) and "mouth" (the mouth of a river). Therefore, it literally means "the mouth of the Plym river".

The name was then carried over to the New World settlement by the Pilgrims.

There isn't a verb or adjective form of "Plymouth" in standard English usage.  It functions solely as a proper noun.  Therefore, grammatical tenses, voices, and negations do not apply to the word itself.  Instead, they would apply to verbs used in sentences containing the word "Plymouth".



Examples of usage in sentences:

* **Plymouth, England:**  I visited Plymouth, England, and saw the Mayflower II. 我参观了英国的普利茅斯，看到了五月花二号。

* **Plymouth, Massachusetts:** We took a historical tour of Plymouth, Massachusetts, learning about the Pilgrims. 我们参加了马萨诸塞州普利茅斯的历史之旅，了解了清教徒。
