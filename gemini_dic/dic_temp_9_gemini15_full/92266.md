词源:
The word "hypervigilant" is a combination of "hyper-" and "vigilant."

* **hyper-**:  A prefix meaning "excessive," "above," or "beyond."  It comes from Greek ὑπέρ (hupér), meaning "over," "above," or "beyond."

* **vigilant**:  Meaning "alertly watchful and attentive to danger or trouble." This word originates from the Latin word "vigilans," the present participle of "vigilare," meaning "to keep watch," "to be awake."  "Vigil" itself derives from the Latin "vigilia," meaning "watch," "wakefulness."
