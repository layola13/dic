词源:
The word "cankered" comes from the Middle English word "cankren," meaning "to become ulcerated or diseased."  This, in turn, has roots in the Old French word "chancre," referring to a malignant ulcer or sore.  The connection to the disease of trees and plants called canker is direct, with the figurative use of the word extending from the literal meaning of decay and corruption.
