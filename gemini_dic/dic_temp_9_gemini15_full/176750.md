词源:
The word "readaptiveness" is a relatively modern coinage, combining "re-" (again, anew), "adapt" (to adjust or modify), and "-ive" (having the nature of) with the noun suffix "-ness" (state or quality of).  It suggests the ability to adapt *again* or repeatedly, implying a dynamic and ongoing process of adjustment.
