inductors:/ɪnˈdʌktərz/| n. |电感器|A passive electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it.  It is typically a coil of wire wound around a core material. Inductors are used in various electronic circuits to filter signals, store energy, and create resonant circuits. |Example: The circuit included several inductors to smooth out the power supply.  这个电路包含几个电感器以平滑电源。

The inductor in the radio circuit helps to tune the frequency.  收音机电路中的电感器有助于调谐频率。|近义词：choke, coil, reactor |反义词：capacitor (stores energy in an electric field)|名词
