词源:
The word "conceptualistically" is derived from the adjective "conceptual," which comes from the noun "concept" (a general notion or idea).  The suffix "-istic" transforms the adjective into an adverbial form, adding the meaning "in a manner characteristic of."  The further addition of "-ally"  reinforces the adverbial function.  Therefore, "conceptualistically" means "in a manner characteristic of concepts" or "in a conceptual manner."
