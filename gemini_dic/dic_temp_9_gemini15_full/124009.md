The word "morogo" is not a standard English word.  It's likely a word from another language, possibly a dialect or a proper noun.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown as requested is impossible without knowing its origin.  To provide the information you requested, I need the language of origin for "morogo".
