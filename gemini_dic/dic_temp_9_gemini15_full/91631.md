hyperbola:/haɪˈpɜːrbələr/| n. |双曲线；夸张法|A hyperbola is a type of conic section, a curve formed by the intersection of a plane and a double cone.  In geometry, it's defined as the set of all points such that the difference of the distances to two fixed points (foci) is constant. In rhetoric, it refers to a figure of speech that uses extreme exaggeration to create emphasis or humor. |例句：The parabolic reflector focuses the light, unlike a hyperbola which spreads it. = 抛物面反射器聚焦光线，不像双曲线那样散射光线。

The comedian's jokes relied heavily on hyperbole. = 喜剧演员的笑话很大程度上依赖于夸张。
