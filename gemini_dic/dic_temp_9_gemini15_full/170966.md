pseudopodium:/suːdəʊˈpɒdiəm/|/ˌsudoʊˈpoʊdiəm/| n. |伪足；伪足状突起 |A pseudopodium is a temporary protrusion of the cytoplasm of a cell, used for locomotion or engulfing food.  It's a temporary extension of a cell's body, usually found in amoeboid cells. |Example: Amoebas use pseudopodia to move and capture prey.  变形虫利用伪足移动和捕获猎物。|近义词：false foot, cytoplasmic projection |反义词：无


USAGE->
一般现在时:
The amoeba extends its pseudopodia to move. = 变形虫伸出伪足移动。
The cell forms pseudopodia to engulf bacteria. = 细胞形成伪足吞噬细菌。


一般过去时:
The amoeba used its pseudopodia to capture food. = 变形虫用伪足捕获食物。
The cell extended pseudopodia and surrounded the particle. = 细胞伸出伪足并包围了颗粒。


现在完成时:
The amoeba has used its pseudopodia to travel a considerable distance. = 变形虫已经用伪足移动了相当远的距离。
The phagocyte has engulfed the bacteria using its pseudopodia. = 吞噬细胞已经利用伪足吞噬了细菌。


过去完成时:
The amoeba had already extended its pseudopodia before I observed it. = 在我观察到变形虫之前，它已经伸出了伪足。
The cell had formed pseudopodia to enclose the food particle before it digested it. = 细胞在消化食物颗粒之前已经形成伪足将其包围。


将来时:
The amoeba will extend its pseudopodia to move towards the food source. = 变形虫将伸出伪足向食物来源移动。
The cell will likely form pseudopodia to ingest the foreign material. = 细胞可能会形成伪足来吞噬异物。


虚拟语气:
If the amoeba had more pseudopodia, it would move faster. = 如果变形虫有更多伪足，它就会移动得更快。
If the cell formed more pseudopodia, it could engulf more bacteria. = 如果细胞形成更多伪足，它就能吞噬更多细菌。


被动语态:
The bacteria were engulfed by the pseudopodia of the phagocyte. = 细菌被吞噬细胞的伪足吞噬了。
The food particle was surrounded and ingested by the extending pseudopodia. = 食物颗粒被伸出的伪足包围并吞噬了。


疑问句:
How many pseudopodia does this amoeba have? = 这个变形虫有多少个伪足？
Do all amoeboid cells use pseudopodia for movement? = 所有变形虫细胞都用伪足来移动吗？


否定句:
The amoeba did not form pseudopodia in the absence of stimuli. = 在没有刺激的情况下，变形虫没有形成伪足。
The cell failed to extend its pseudopodia to capture the prey. = 细胞未能伸出伪足捕获猎物。


PHRASE->
formation of pseudopodia  伪足的形成
extension of pseudopodia 伪足的伸展
retraction of pseudopodia 伪足的回缩
locomotion by pseudopodia 用伪足运动
amoeboid movement with pseudopodia  利用伪足的变形虫运动
