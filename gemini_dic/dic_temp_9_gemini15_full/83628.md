haemocytotrypsis:/ˌhiːməʊsaɪtəˈtrɪpsɪs/| n. |血细胞破坏；血细胞崩解|The destruction or disintegration of blood cells.  This term is less common in modern medical literature and is often replaced by more specific terms depending on the type of blood cell affected and the cause of the destruction.|例句：The study investigated the haemocytotrypsis caused by the novel toxin.  这项研究调查了这种新型毒素引起的血液细胞破坏。

例句：Excessive exposure to radiation can lead to haemocytotrypsis in bone marrow.  过度暴露于辐射会导致骨髓中血细胞破坏。


近义词：haemolysis (if referring specifically to red blood cells), leucopenia (if referring to white blood cells), thrombocytopenia (if referring to platelets), cytolysis |反义词：haemopoiesis (blood cell formation)


词源:
* **haemo-**:  from Greek *haima* (αἷμα), meaning "blood".
* **cyto-**: from Greek *kytos* (κύτος), meaning "cell".
* **-trypsis**: from Greek *tripsis* (τρίψις), meaning "a rubbing, grinding, crushing".  This suffix often indicates a process of destruction or disintegration.

一般现在时:
Haemocytotrypsis is a serious complication of some diseases. = 血细胞破坏是某些疾病的严重并发症。
The level of haemocytotrypsis correlates with disease severity. = 血细胞破坏程度与疾病严重程度相关。


一般过去时:
Significant haemocytotrypsis was observed after the treatment. =  治疗后观察到明显的血细胞破坏。
Haemocytotrypsis occurred in a significant portion of the patient population. = 在很大一部分患者中发生了血细胞破坏。


现在完成时:
Researchers have identified several factors contributing to haemocytotrypsis. = 研究人员已经确定了导致血细胞破坏的几个因素。
The patient has experienced haemocytotrypsis following the drug administration. = 服药后，患者出现了血细胞破坏。


过去完成时:
By the time the diagnosis was made, significant haemocytotrypsis had already occurred. =  确诊时，严重的血液细胞破坏已经发生了。
The researchers had hypothesized that the toxin would induce haemocytotrypsis. = 研究人员假设这种毒素会诱导血细胞破坏。


将来时:
Further research will investigate the mechanism of haemocytotrypsis. = 进一步的研究将调查血细胞破坏的机制。

被动语态:
Haemocytotrypsis was observed in the experimental group. = 在实验组中观察到血细胞破坏。
The haemocytotrypsis was attributed to the toxic effects of the drug. = 血细胞破坏归因于药物的毒性作用。


疑问句:
Is haemocytotrypsis a common side effect of this treatment? = 血细胞破坏是这种治疗的常见副作用吗？
What are the main causes of haemocytotrypsis in this context? = 在这种情况下，血细胞破坏的主要原因是什么？


否定句:
No significant haemocytotrypsis was detected in the control group. = 在对照组中未检测到明显的血液细胞破坏。
