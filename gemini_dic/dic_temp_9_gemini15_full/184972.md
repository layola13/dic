词源: The word "retecious" is not a standard English word.  There is no established etymology or common usage. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  The closest existing word with similar meaning is "reticent," which derives from the Latin "reticēns," the present participle of "reticēre," meaning "to be silent."
