词源:
The word "outsumming" is a relatively modern creation, a blend of "out" (meaning exceeding or surpassing) and "summing" (meaning totaling or summarizing).  It doesn't have a long etymological history like some words.  It's a semantically transparent word, meaning its meaning is easily understood from its component parts.
