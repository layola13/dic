oversteadinesses:/ˌoʊvərˈstedinəsiz/| n. |过度稳定性；过分稳定的事态|The word "oversteadinesses" is not a standard English word. It's a nonce word, meaning it's created for a specific occasion and is not found in dictionaries. It's formed by adding the prefix "over-" (meaning "too much" or "excessive") to the plural noun "steadinesses" (the plural of "steadiness," meaning a state of being steady or stable).  Therefore, it implies an excessive or undesirable degree of stability or a situation where things are too stable.  There are no standard examples of its usage because it's not a real word.  You would need to provide context to understand its intended meaning in a specific situation.  |近义词: excessive stability, undue constancy, over-stability|反义词: instability, volatility, changeability|n.
