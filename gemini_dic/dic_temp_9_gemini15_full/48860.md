词源:

The word "deformed" comes from the Old French word *deforme*, which is a combination of the prefix "de-" (meaning "away from" or "reverse") and the word "forme" (meaning "form" or "shape").  Therefore, the original meaning literally implies a "removal from form" or an alteration of the original form.  This etymology clearly shows the word's connection to a change from a proper or expected shape.
