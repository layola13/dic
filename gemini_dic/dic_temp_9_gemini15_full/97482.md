The word "ingenit" does not exist in standard English.  There is no entry for it in major dictionaries.  Therefore, I cannot provide a detailed analysis as requested.  It is possible that:

* It is a misspelling of another word.  Could you please double-check the spelling?
* It is a neologism (newly coined word) or a word from a very specialized field.  If so, please provide context where you encountered this word.
* It is a word from a different language. If so, please specify the language.


Please provide more information so I can assist you better.
