cryogens:/ˈkraɪədʒənz/| n. |制冷剂；极低温物质|Substances used to produce very low temperatures, typically below -150°C (-238°F). Cryogens are often gases liquefied under high pressure, such as nitrogen, oxygen, helium, and hydrogen. They are used in various applications, including cryosurgery, MRI, and the preservation of biological samples.|Liquid nitrogen is a common cryogen used in many scientific and industrial applications. 液氮是一种常用的制冷剂，广泛应用于许多科学和工业领域。|近义词：refrigerants, coolants|反义词：heat sources
