The word "laft" is not a standard English word.  There is no entry for it in major English dictionaries.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling, a dialect word, a neologism, or a word from another language.  To provide an analysis, I would need more context on where you encountered this word.
