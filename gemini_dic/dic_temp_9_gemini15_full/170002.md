词源:  Comes from the verb "protect,"  which originates from Old French *protegere (to protect), from Latin *protegere (to protect, cover, defend).  The prefix "pro-" means "before" or "in front of," and "-tegere" is related to the word "tegmen" (covering).  Therefore, the original meaning implies something covering or shielding from the front.
