词源:

The word "non-interventionism" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not"), the noun "intervention" (meaning "interference"), and the suffix "-ism" (meaning "doctrine" or "policy").  "Intervention" itself comes from the Latin verb *intervenire*, meaning "to come between". Therefore, non-interventionism literally means "the doctrine or policy of not interfering".
