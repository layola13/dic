parasynthetic:/ˌpærəsɪnˈθɛtɪk/| adj.| 并合的；兼并的 | Formed by combining elements from different word formations.  Parasynthetic words are created by adding both a prefix and a suffix to a base word, resulting in a new word with a meaning distinct from the base word or its prefixed/suffixed forms. This process is distinct from simply adding a prefix or suffix alone. | Example:  The word "unbreakable" is parasynthetic because it combines the prefix "un-" and the suffix "-able" to the base word "break," creating a new meaning not present in "break," "unbreak," or "breakable." | 近义词：derivational, compounded | 反义词：simple, primitive
