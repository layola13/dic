The word "outhiring" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a newly coined word or a misspelling.  Therefore, a full etymological analysis and grammatical breakdown are impossible.  However, based on its structure, we can infer its potential meaning and provide a possible analysis.


If "outhiring" were intended to exist, it would likely be a verb, formed by combining "out-" (meaning "to surpass" or "to exceed") and "hiring."  In this case, it would mean to hire more people than a competitor or to surpass someone in hiring practices.


Let's create a hypothetical entry based on this interpretation:


outhiring: /ˌaʊtˈhaɪərɪŋ/ | v. | 超越招聘；招聘人数超过 | To hire a greater number of people than a competitor or to surpass someone in hiring practices.  It implies a competitive aspect, focusing on the quantity or scale of hiring. |
