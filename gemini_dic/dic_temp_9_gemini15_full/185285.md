词源:
The word "retreaded" comes from the verb "retread," which is formed by adding the prefix "re-" (meaning "again") to the word "tread."  "Tread" originally referred to the act of walking or stepping, but in the context of tires, it refers to the grooved surface of the tire that makes contact with the road. Therefore, "retread" means to renew the tread of a tire.
