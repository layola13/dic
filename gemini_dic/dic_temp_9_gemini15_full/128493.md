newspeak: /ˈnuːˌspiːk/ | n. | 新话；政治语言 |

英文解析：Newspeak is a controlled language in George Orwell's dystopian novel *Nineteen Eighty-Four*.  It's designed to limit thought and expression by reducing vocabulary and eliminating words that might encourage independent thinking or rebellion against the ruling Party.  The aim is to make rebellious thoughts literally unthinkable.  The term is now used more broadly to describe any kind of intentionally misleading or manipulative language, often used by political figures or institutions to control information and public opinion.
