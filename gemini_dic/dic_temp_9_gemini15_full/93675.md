imesatin:  /ˌaɪmɛˈsætɪn/ | n. | 依美沙坦 |  Imesatin is not a recognized English word. There is no entry for it in standard dictionaries or medical terminology databases.  It's possible this is a misspelling, a newly coined term, or a term specific to a certain field not widely known.  Therefore, I cannot provide a full etymology, usage, synonyms, antonyms, or grammatical examples.
