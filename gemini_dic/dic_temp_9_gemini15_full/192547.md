词源:
The word "scuffle" comes from the Middle English word "scuffelen," meaning "to shuffle the feet."  This in turn may be related to the Old Norse word "skufla," meaning "to shovel." The sense of a confused fight developed later, likely from the image of people pushing and shoving with their feet.
