phototrophically:/ˌfoʊtoʊˈtrɒfɪkli/ | adv. | 光养地，利用光能自养地 |  Describes an organism that obtains energy from light to synthesize its own food.  This process is called phototrophy. | Example:  Cyanobacteria grow phototrophically, using sunlight to produce energy.  蓝细菌通过光合作用利用阳光产生能量。  | 近义词: photosynthetically (more specific to photosynthesis) | 反义词: chemotrophically (obtaining energy from chemicals)
