preindulgences: /ˌpriːɪnˈdʌldʒənsɪz/ | n. | 事先放纵；预先纵容 |  The word "preindulgences" is not a standard English word found in common dictionaries. It appears to be a neologism, a newly coined word, formed by combining "pre-" (meaning before or in advance) and "indulgences" (acts of indulging or giving in to desires).  Therefore, a precise definition and usage examples require contextual understanding.  The intended meaning likely refers to acts of self-indulgence or permissive behavior that occur before a specific event or period. |  Example:  His preindulgences in rich foods led to discomfort during the long hike. (他的暴饮暴食导致他在长途跋涉中感到不适。) | 近义词:  preliminary excesses, prior self-indulgence, anticipatory gratification | 反义词:  preemptive abstinence, prior restraint, self-denial | n.
