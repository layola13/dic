词源:
The word "delegating" comes from the verb "delegate," which originates from the Latin word "delegatus," the past participle of "delegare."  "Delegare" itself is composed of "de-" (away, from) and "legare" (to send, appoint, commission).  Therefore, the core meaning is "to send away" or "to appoint someone to represent."
