presmoothing:/ˈpriːˌsmuːðɪŋ/| n. |预平滑|The process of smoothing data before further processing, typically to reduce noise or other artifacts.  This often involves applying a smoothing filter or algorithm to the data before other operations are performed.  It's a preprocessing step aimed at improving the quality or accuracy of subsequent analyses. |Example: Presmoothing the image significantly reduced the noise and improved the clarity of the details. 预平滑图像显著降低了噪声并提高了细节清晰度。|近义词：pre-processing, filtering, smoothing |反义词：sharpening, enhancing
