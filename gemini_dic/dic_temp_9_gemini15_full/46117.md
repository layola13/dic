cylindricity:/ˌsɪlɪnˈdrɪsɪti/| n. |圆柱度，圆柱形|The degree to which a physical object approximates the shape of a geometric cylinder.  It refers to the variation in diameter along the length of a cylindrical object.  Imperfect cylindricity is often measured using a cylindricity gauge.|The cylindricity of the piston was within the acceptable tolerance.|近义词：roundness, circularity|反义词：irregularity, non-cylindrical shape
