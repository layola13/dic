diluvium:/dɪˈluːviəm/| n. |洪积层；洪积物；大洪水|A diluvium is a deposit of sediment laid down by a catastrophic flood, often associated with glacial meltwater.  It typically consists of a heterogeneous mixture of poorly sorted gravel, sand, silt, and clay. The term is now largely obsolete in scientific usage, replaced by more precise geological terms.|The diluvium was characterized by large boulders scattered amongst finer sediments.|alluvium, glacial deposits|none|名词

PHRASE->

There are not many common phrases directly using "diluvium" due to its limited usage in modern geology.  Instead, phrases would describe the characteristics or processes related to diluvium:

1. diluvium deposit: 洪积层沉积物
2. diluvial gravels: 洪积砾石
3. diluvial fan: 洪积扇 (though less common, as "alluvial fan" is preferred)
