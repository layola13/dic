The word "predoubts" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling or a newly coined word.  Therefore, a full analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  To provide helpful information, we need to consider possible intended words.  Did you perhaps mean one of the following?

* **Predoubts (as a potential neologism):** If "predoubts" was intended as a novel word, it could be interpreted as meaning "doubts that precede something" or "preemptive doubts."  However, without context or established usage, its meaning would be highly ambiguous and its grammatical function uncertain.


* **Pre-doubts (hyphenated):** This is a more likely interpretation, suggesting doubts that exist *before* something else.  Again, context is key.


* **Prejudices:** This word shares a semantic overlap with the concept of having doubts beforehand.  It refers to preconceived opinions that may not be based on reason or actual experience.


* **Preconceptions:** Similar to prejudices, preconceptions are ideas formed in advance of adequate knowledge or experience.


If you could clarify the intended word or provide the context in which you encountered "predoubts," a more accurate analysis could be provided.  For example, providing the sentence where you saw the word would help determine its intended meaning and grammatical function.
