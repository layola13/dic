词源:  The word "nondiffuse" is a combination of the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "diffuse" (meaning "spreading widely").  Therefore, "nondiffuse" literally means "not spreading widely."  The root of "diffuse" traces back to the Latin word "diffundere," meaning "to pour out" or "to spread."
