词源:
The term "natural gas" is a compound word. "Natural" comes from the Latin word "naturalis," meaning "of or pertaining to nature."  "Gas" originates from the Dutch word "gas," coined by the Flemish chemist Jan Baptista van Helmont in the 17th century, possibly derived from the Greek word "chaos" meaning "emptiness". The term refers to its gaseous state and its occurrence in nature.
