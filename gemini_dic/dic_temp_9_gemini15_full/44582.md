词源:
The word "croupier" comes from the French word "croupier," which ultimately derives from the Old French word "croupe," meaning "rump" or "buttocks."  In the context of gambling, it originally referred to the position of the dealer sitting behind the table, closer to the "rump" of the table.  The word's evolution reflects the physical arrangement of early gambling tables.
