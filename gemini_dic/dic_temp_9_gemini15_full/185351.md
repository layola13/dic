词源:  The word "retroactively" is derived from the prefix "retro-" (meaning "backward" or "back") and the word "active."  The "-ly" suffix indicates an adverb.  The root "retro-" comes from the Latin "retro," meaning "backward."  The word thus literally means "acting backward" or "applying backward in time."
