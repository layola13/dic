nautiloids:/ˈnɔːtɪlɔɪdz/| n.|鹦鹉螺类（软体动物）|Extinct and extant cephalopod molluscs characterized by a shell that is typically coiled and chambered.  Nautiloids are a diverse group, with some species living in deep ocean waters and others inhabiting shallower environments. They are known for their complex shell structures and unique ways of controlling buoyancy.|例句：The fossil record shows a remarkable diversity of nautiloids throughout geological history.  化石记录显示鹦鹉螺类在整个地质历史上具有显著的多样性。

例句：Modern nautiloids, such as the chambered nautilus, are relatively few in number compared to their extinct relatives. 现代鹦鹉螺，例如鹦鹉螺，与它们已灭绝的亲属相比数量相对较少。


近义词：cephalopods (a broader term)|反义词：无
