词源:  The word "nondigestible" is formed from the prefix "non-" (meaning "not") and the adjective "digestible," which comes from the verb "digest" (from Latin *digerere, meaning "to distribute," "to arrange," or "to digest").  The suffix "-ible" indicates something capable of being done.  Therefore, "nondigestible" literally means "not capable of being digested."
