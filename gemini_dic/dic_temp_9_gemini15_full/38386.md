词源:
The word "conceptualises" is derived from the noun "concept" and the suffix "-alise" (or "-ize").  "Concept" comes from the Latin word "conceptum," the past participle of "concipere," meaning "to conceive, to take in, to understand." The suffix "-alise" is a verb-forming suffix indicating "to make or become."  Therefore, "conceptualise" means "to form into a concept" or "to make conceptual."
