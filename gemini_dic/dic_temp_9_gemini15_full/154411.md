词源:
The word "permissiblenesses" is derived from the adjective "permissible," which in turn comes from the verb "permit."  "Permit" traces its origins back to the Old French word "permettre," which is a combination of the prefix "per-" (through, thoroughly) and "mettre" (to put, place).  The "-nesses" suffix is a pluralizing suffix that indicates multiple instances or aspects of a quality or state.  Therefore, "permissiblenesses" signifies the multiple aspects or instances of what is permissible.
