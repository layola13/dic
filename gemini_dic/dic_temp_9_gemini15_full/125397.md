multinomial:/ˌmʌltiˈnoʊmiəl/ | adj. | 多项式的；多项的 | Relating to or denoting a polynomial of more than one term.  A multinomial distribution is a probability distribution that describes the probability of observing a certain combination of outcomes when there are more than two possible outcomes. | Example:  The equation is a multinomial expression. 这个方程是一个多项式表达式。 The survey results followed a multinomial distribution. 调查结果遵循多项分布。 | 近义词：polynomial (in the mathematical sense) | 反义词：monomial (单项式)


USAGE->
This word is primarily an adjective, so it doesn't conjugate like a verb.  Its usage is primarily descriptive within mathematical or statistical contexts.  There's no tense to conjugate.

Example 1 (descriptive):
The multinomial theorem is crucial for understanding probabilities in complex scenarios. 多项式定理对于理解复杂情况下的概率至关重要。

Example 2 (descriptive):
This statistical model employs a multinomial distribution to analyze categorical data.  这个统计模型采用多项分布来分析分类数据。


PHRASE->
There aren't common phrases directly using "multinomial" as it's a technical term.  Phrases would be built around the concept, rather than the word itself.  For example:

multinomial distribution 多项分布
multinomial theorem 多项式定理
multinomial coefficient 多项式系数
multinomial logistic regression 多项逻辑回归
multinomial probit model 多项概率模型
