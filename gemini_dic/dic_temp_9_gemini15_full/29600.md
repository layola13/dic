The word "cated" does not exist as a standalone word in standard English.  Therefore, a complete analysis according to your requested format is impossible.  It's likely a misspelling or a part of a larger word.  To provide a helpful response, I need more context.  Where did you encounter this word?  Knowing the surrounding words or sentence would help determine its intended meaning and allow for a proper analysis.
