词源:

The word "legitimizer" is derived from the verb "legitimize," which in turn comes from the Late Latin word "legitimare," meaning "to make lawful" or "to declare legitimate."  "Legitimare" itself is composed of "legitimus" (lawful, rightful) and the suffix "-are" (to make).  Therefore, the root of the word lies in the concept of lawfulness and rightfulness.
