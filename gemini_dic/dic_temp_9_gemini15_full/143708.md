词源:

The word "outlier" is a relatively modern term. It's a compound word formed from "out" (meaning outside or beyond) and "lier" (a suffix related to words like "idler" and "idler," suggesting something that stands apart).  The term gained prominence in statistics and data analysis in the 20th century.  Its roots are in the broader concept of exceptional or unusual data points, which have been recognized in various fields long before the term itself was coined.
