词源:
The word "humbug" originated in the late 18th century, likely a combination of "hum" (meaning to make a low, indistinct sound, often associated with deception or trickery) and "bug" (meaning a small, annoying insect or a problem). It evolved to describe something deceptive, nonsensical, or generally annoying.  The exact etymology remains debated.
