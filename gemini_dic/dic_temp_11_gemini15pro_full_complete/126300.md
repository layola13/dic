词源：  "myo-" (muscle) + "-galid" (milk).  The exact etymology is unclear and likely related to the calming effect some of these drugs have, possibly likened to the soothing effect of milk.  However, this is speculative, and a definitive etymology is hard to come by.  The term is primarily used in a pharmaceutical context and is not a common word in everyday conversation.
