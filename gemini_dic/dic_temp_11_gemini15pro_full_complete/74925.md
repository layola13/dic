From Middle English *fretten*, from Old English *fretan* (“to devour, consume”), from Proto-Germanic *fretaną* (“to gnaw, eat”), from Proto-Indo-European *ǵʰer- (“to rub, grind”).  Related to Old Norse *freta* (“to gnaw”), German *fressen* (“to eat (of animals)”), Dutch *vreten* (“to eat greedily”).
