词源：This word is considered a slur, derived from "gypsy," an outdated and offensive term for the Romani people. Its usage perpetuates negative stereotypes and is therefore discouraged.  The connection likely stems from prejudiced assumptions that Romani people were prone to dishonesty.  More appropriate and neutral synonyms should be used instead.
