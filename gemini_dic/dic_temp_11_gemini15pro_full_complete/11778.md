From French *arpentateur*, from *arpenter* "to survey land," from Late Latin *arpentare*, from *arepennis* "acre," from Latin *area* "area" + *penna* "wing, feather."  The original meaning referred to a measure of land, approximately an acre, which was likely based on the area a person could plow in a day.
