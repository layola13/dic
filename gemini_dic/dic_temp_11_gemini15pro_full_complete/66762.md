exospore:/ˈeksoʊspɔːr/ | n. |外生孢子; (蓝藻的) 外壁孢子 |A resistant spore formed outside a cell, especially in certain algae and fungi.  |Example 1: The exospores of the algae were resistant to the harsh environmental conditions. 这些藻类的外生孢子对恶劣的环境条件具有抵抗力。

Example 2: The scientist studied the formation of exospores in the fungal sample. 科学家研究了真菌样本中外生孢子的形成。 |近义词: spore,  |反义词: endospore |词性: 名词
