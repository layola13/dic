From Late Latin *attributum*, neuter of attributus, past participle of attribuere “to assign, bestow, attribute,” from ad- “to” + tribuere “to allot, bestow.”

Synonyms->
(n.) characteristic, trait, quality, feature, property, aspect
(v.) ascribe, assign, credit, impute

Antonyms->
(n.)  It's difficult to establish a direct antonym for "attribute" as a noun. The opposite of a specific attribute would depend on the attribute itself (e.g., the opposite of "kindness" is "cruelty").
(v.) deny, refute, disclaim
