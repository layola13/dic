##详细解析英文单词 {oversquare}vərˈskwɛr/| adj. | 过方的，边长大于宽度的 | 超过正方形的；指形状上比正方形更宽 |  An oversquare engine has a larger bore than stroke.一个过方形发动机的气缸直径大于冲程。 | 近义词：wide, broad | 反义词：undersquaremeaning is therefore directly derived from these two components, indicating a shape or ratio that exceeds the proportions of a square.  The specific application in engineering (referring to engine design) developed later.of "oversquare" is in relation to engine design. In this context, an "oversquare engine" is one where the bore (the diameter of the cylinder) is larger than the stroke (the distance the piston travels). This design choice has implications for engine performance, often resulting in higher horsepower at higher RPMsbut potentially less torque at lower RPMs.  It's a technical term understood primarily by those in the automotive or engineering fields. Beyond this specialized use, it can describe any shape that is broader than it is tall or long, exceeding the proportions of a perfect square. However, this generalized application is far less common.an oversquare engine design for improved performance. (我们目前正在测试一种过方发动机设计以提高性能。)technology for the past five years. (过去五年来，我们一直在开发过方发动机技术。)components. (他们当时正在检查过方发动机的部件。)for years before finding success. (他们在取得成功之前已经研究过方设计多年了。)will be testing the new oversquare engine next week.  (他们下周将测试新的过方发动机。)时:**  By the end of the project, they will have been developing oversquare engine technology for a decade.  (到项目结束时，他们将已经研发过方发动机技术十年了。)related terms often used include):at the bottom of the stroke to the volume at the top of the stroke.showing the engine's torque output across different engine speeds (RPM).  Oversquare engines often have distinct torque characteristics compared to undersquare engines.
