bacteroid:/ˈbæktərɔɪd/| n. |类菌体；拟杆菌|A bacteroid is a modified bacterial cell, often pleomorphic (variably shaped), that is involved in nitrogen fixation in the root nodules of legumes.  |Example 1: The bacteroids in the root nodules convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia. 类菌体在根瘤中将大气中的氮转化为氨。

Example 2:  Scientists are studying the specific genes involved in bacteroid development. 科学家们正在研究参与类菌体发育的特定基因。|Synonym: rhizobium (specifically for nitrogen-fixing bacteria in legume nodules)|Antonym:  (No direct antonym exists, as it describes a specific cell type.)|noun
