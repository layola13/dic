cephalotrocha:/ˌsɛfələˈtroʊkə/ | n. | 头感器，头感器官 |A sensory organ located on the head, typically associated with aquatic invertebrates.  It often bears cilia and is involved in feeding and locomotion. | Example: The cephalotrocha of the rotifer beat rhythmically, creating a current that draws food particles towards its mouth.  轮虫的头感器有节奏地跳动，产生一股水流，将食物颗粒吸向它的嘴。

Example: Researchers studied the structure of the cephalotrocha to understand its role in the organism's sensory perception. 研究人员研究了头感器官的结构，以了解它在生物体感觉感知中的作用。| 近义词:  corona (in rotifers) | 反义词: N/A | 词性: noun

Etymology:  cephalo- (Greek: κεφαλή, kephalḗ, "head") + -trocha (Greek: τροχός, trokhós, "wheel")
