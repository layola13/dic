Etymology:
From nymph + -like.  "Nymph" comes from the Late Middle English *nymfe*, borrowed from the Old French *nimphe*, and ultimately from the Latin *nympha*, which itself comes from the Greek *νύμφη (nýmphē)*. The suffix "-like" is a native English suffix used to form adjectives indicating resemblance.
