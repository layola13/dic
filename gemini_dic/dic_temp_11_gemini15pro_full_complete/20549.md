ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English *blæc "dark," from Proto-Germanic *blakaz "burned" (source also of Old Saxon blak, Old Norse blakkr, Dutch blaken "to burn," Old High German blah "black," German bleich "pale"), from PIE root *bhleg- "to burn, gleam, shine, flash."  The meaning evolution is from "burned" to "darkened by burning" to "dark."
