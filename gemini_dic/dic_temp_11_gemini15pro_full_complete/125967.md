注意事项:

*  "Musimon" is a neologism, a newly coined word.  While grammatically correct in its formation, it's not a recognized or standard English word. Its meaning is inferred from its construction (museum + person).  It's crucial to understand that using this word in real-world contexts might lead to confusion as people are unlikely to be familiar with it.  Consider using existing terms like "museum enthusiast," "museum professional," or "museumgoer" instead.

* The etymology is simply derived from "museum" and the suffix "-on" which is used to form nouns denoting persons associated with something (e.g., liaison, politician).
