Etymology:
From concerted + -ness + -'s (possessive).  Concerted comes from the late Middle English word *concerten*, from the Old French *concerter*, meaning "to agree, arrange together." Ultimately derived from the Latin *concertare*, "to contend, contest," from *com-*, "together," + *certare*, "to strive, contend."  The suffix *-ness* forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.  The final -'s indicates possession.
