mutexes:/ˈmjuːtɛksɪz/
|n.|互斥锁，互斥体|A mutex (mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive that enforces limits on access to a resource.  It ensures that only one thread or process can hold the mutex at a time, preventing race conditions and ensuring data integrity when shared resources are accessed.|The application uses mutexes to protect shared data structures from concurrent access.|近义词：locks, semaphores|反义词:|名词
