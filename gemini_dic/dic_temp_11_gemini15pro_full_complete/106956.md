lack-in:/lækˈɪn/ | n. | 缺乏，不足 | A lack-in of essential vitamins can lead to health problems. |  A lack-in of funding prevented the project from completion. | deficiency, shortage, dearth | sufficiency, abundance | noun

Etymology:  "Lack-in" is a relatively recent formation, likely arising in the late 20th or early 21st century. It's formed from the noun "lack" (from Middle English *lakke*, from Old Norse *lakkr* "defect, failure") and the preposition "in," suggesting a deficiency or shortage "in" something.  It's less common than "lack of" but follows a similar pattern of formation as other compound nouns with "in" indicating a location or area of deficiency (e.g., "drop-in," "built-in").
