PHRASE->
(Phrases with "are not" are less common, the full form "are not" is generally preferred over contractions in formal writing.  Here are some possibilities using similar contractions)

aren't you coming? = 你不来吗？
aren't they ready yet? = 他们还没准备好？
aren't we going together? = 我们不一起去吗？
We aren't friends anymore. = 我们不再是朋友了.
They aren't happy about the situation. = 他们对情况不满意.


注意事项:

"aren't" is the common contraction for "are not."  "Ain't" is a highly informal and grammatically incorrect contraction often used in some dialects to represent "am not," "is not," "are not," "has not," and "have not." While widely understood, it's generally best to avoid using "ain't" in formal writing and speech.
