The word "bolye" does not appear to be a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a regional dialect word, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard linguistic analysis.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word or what you believe its meaning to be, I might be able to offer some further assistance.  For example, perhaps it's a variant spelling of "boil" or "bole."

However, as requested, I can demonstrate the requested format using the word "what" as an example:

what /wɒt/ (UK) /wʌt/ (US) |pron. det. adv. int.| 什么，多么，何等 |Used to ask for information specifying something. | What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ |  which, how | N/A | pronoun
what /wɒt/ (UK) /wʌt/ (US) |pron. det. adv. int.| 什么，多么，何等 |Used to ask for information specifying something. | What do you want? 你想要什么？ |  which, how | N/A | determiner
