词源:  "Face" comes from Old French "face" and Latin "facies" (form, appearance, face). "Up" is from Old English "up" (upwards, above). "To" is from Old English "to" (towards, in the direction of).  The phrasal verb "face up to" developed its figurative meaning of confronting something difficult relatively recently, in the early 20th century.
