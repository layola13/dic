argand:/ˈɑːrɡænd/| adj. n.| 阿甘的，阿甘图;|Relating to or denoting a diagram in which complex numbers are represented by points in the plane, the complex number  x + iy  being represented by the point (x, y).  Also called Argand diagram.|The students were taught how to plot complex numbers on an Argand diagram. 学生们被教导如何在阿甘图上绘制复数。|近义词:complex plane, Gaussian plane|反义词: N/A|词性:adjective, noun

Etymology->
Named after Jean-Robert Argand (1768-1822), a Swiss amateur mathematician.  Although the representation of complex numbers as points in the plane was used earlier by Caspar Wessel (1797) and Carl Friedrich Gauss (1799), Argand's independent publication in 1806 made the concept more widely known.
