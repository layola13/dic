ETYMOLOGY->
From ion + -ize.  "Ion" comes from Greek "ion" (going), present participle of "ienai" (to go). "-ize" is a suffix forming verbs meaning "to cause to be or become," "to treat with," "to subject to the action of," from Greek "-izein," a verb-forming element denoting action, state, or condition.
