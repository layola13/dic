ETYMOLOGY->
"Come" comes from Old English "cuman," meaning "to come, approach, arrive." "Terms" comes from Old French "termes" and ultimately from Latin "terminus," meaning "limit, boundary, end, term." The phrase "come to terms" originally referred to reaching an agreement on specific terms or conditions.  Over time, it broadened to encompass the idea of accepting or adapting to difficult situations.
