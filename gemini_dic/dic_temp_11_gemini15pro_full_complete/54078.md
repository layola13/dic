ETYMOLOGY->
From dis- + elder (comparative of old), implying a state of being "worse than old" or "broken down."  This is a constructed word, likely intended to evoke a sense of decay and disorder, and is not a standard English word.  While "dis-" is a common prefix indicating negation or reversal, "elder" being used in this way is non-standard.  It's likely modeled on words like "dismember" or "disable."
