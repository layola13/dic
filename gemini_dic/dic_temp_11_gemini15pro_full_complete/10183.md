apoptosis:/ˌeɪpɒpˈtoʊsɪs/ /ˌæpəpˈtoʊsɪs/
n.|细胞凋亡|Programmed cell death, a natural process of cell self-destruction.  The word comes from the Greek "apo" (from, away) and "ptosis" (falling).|The researchers studied the role of apoptosis in cancer development. 研究人员研究了细胞凋亡在癌症发展中的作用。|synonyms: programmed cell death, cell suicide|antonyms: cell proliferation, necrosis|noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From Ancient Greek ἀπόπτωσις (apóptōsis, “a falling off”), from ἀπό (apó, “from, off, away”) + πτῶσις (ptôsis, “a falling, fall”). Coined in 1972 by John F. Kerr, Andrew H. Wyllie, and Alastair R. Currie.
