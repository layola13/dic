ETYMOLOGY->
From Italian *marzapane*, from earlier *matapan*, from Medieval Latin *matapanus*.  This is probably from Arabic مَرْطَبَان‎ (marṭabān), meaning "Martaban jar," a type of ceramic jar, in which the confection was originally stored and sold. The jar's name in turn comes from Martaban, a port in Burma (now Myanmar).
