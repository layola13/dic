ichorhaemia:/ˌaɪkɔːrˈhiːmiə/
noun
脓血症
The presence of ichor, a watery discharge, in the blood.  This term is largely archaic and rarely used in modern medical terminology.
Septicemia is a more common and accurate term to describe a systemic infection in the bloodstream.  Ichorhaemia implies a thin, watery discharge in the blood, which isn't a precise description of what happens in sepsis.

There are no common examples of ichorhaemia used in modern English, as the term is archaic.  An example using the more accurate term, septicemia, would be: "The patient developed septicemia after the surgery."

近义词:septicaemia, blood poisoning
反义词: (No direct antonym, as it represents a pathological state.  One could consider "health" or "wellness" as antonyms in a broader sense.)
