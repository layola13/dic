注意事项:

Hawaiian grammar and tenses are significantly different from English.  The examples given aim to convey the closest approximations, but nuances and context are crucial in Hawaiian. Direct translations often don't capture the full meaning.

The use of "kau" is primarily informal and can be considered dialectal.  "ʻOe" is the more commonly used and formally correct pronoun for "you."  However, "kau" is still used in certain contexts, especially in songs and older forms of Hawaiian.
