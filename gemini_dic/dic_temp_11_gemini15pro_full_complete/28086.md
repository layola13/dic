capillary:/ˈkæpɪˌleri/
adj.|毛细血管的, 毛细管的|Relating to capillaries or a capillary tube.|Capillary action causes the water to rise in the tube.|近义词:minute, fine, hairlike|反义词:large, wide|词性:形容词
tube:/tuːb/
n.|管, 管子|A hollow cylinder, typically made of metal, plastic, or glass, used to convey fluids or other substances.|The plumber replaced the damaged tube.|近义词:pipe, conduit, hose|反义词:solid, block|词性:名词


ETYMOLOGY->
"capillary-tube" is a compound word. "Capillary" comes from the Latin "capillaris," meaning "hair-like,"  related to "capillus" (hair). "Tube" comes from the Old French "tube" and ultimately the Latin "tubus" (pipe).
