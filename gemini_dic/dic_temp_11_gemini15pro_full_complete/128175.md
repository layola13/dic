ETYMOLOGY->
From network + -ing (present participle suffix) + -s (plural marker).  "Network" itself comes from "net" (meaning a woven fabric) and "work" (meaning labor or construction).  The original meaning referred to a physical network of interconnected things. The modern sense of social and professional connections developed later.
