iasu is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, an acronym, a slang term, or a word from a specialized field.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you could provide more context, like where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance. For example, is it from a specific region, a technical document, or a fictional work?
