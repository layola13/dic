词源： "Aqua-" comes from Latin, meaning "water." "-sco" is a less common suffix suggesting relation or connection.  Therefore, "aquasco" literally translates to "related to water."  While not a standard dictionary word, it's understandable based on its Latin roots and is sometimes used in specialized contexts related to aquariums or aquatic life.
