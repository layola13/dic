注意事项:

"He's" cannot be used in past tenses.  It always implies a present or perfect tense.  Attempting to use it with past tense verbs results in grammatically incorrect sentences.

While "he's" can contract "he has," it cannot contract "he had."  "He had" contracts to "he'd," which can also contract "he would."  This can cause ambiguity.
