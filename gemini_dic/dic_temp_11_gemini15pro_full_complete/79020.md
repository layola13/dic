The word "gittith" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling or a word from a specialized vocabulary or dialect.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard analysis.  However, if you meant "getteth" (an archaic form of "gets"), I can provide information for that:


getteth: /ˈɡɛtɛθ/ | v. (archaic) | 得到，获得 |  An archaic third-person singular present form of the verb "get," meaning to obtain, acquire, or receive something. | Example: He getteth the prize for his bravery. 他因勇敢而获得奖品。| Synonym: obtains, acquires, receives | Antonym: loses, forfeits | Verb
