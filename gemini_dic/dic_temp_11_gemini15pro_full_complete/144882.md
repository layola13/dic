词源： "over-ride" comes from "over" + "ride".  "Over" implies exceeding or going beyond, while "ride" originally meant to travel on horseback.  Thus, "over-ride" initially meant to ride over something, and figuratively, to dominate or suppress. The "-ing" form, "over-riding,"  functions as an adjective describing something dominant or prevailing.
