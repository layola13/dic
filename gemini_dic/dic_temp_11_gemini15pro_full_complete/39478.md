词源:
From connive + -ing + -ly.  Connive comes from the Latin word *connivēre*, meaning "to close the eyes, wink at," from *com-* (together) + *nīvēre* (to wink).  The original sense was "to overlook or pretend not to see something wrong," which evolved into the current meaning of "to secretly conspire or plot."
