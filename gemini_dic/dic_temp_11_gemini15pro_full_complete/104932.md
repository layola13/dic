"Kellor" isn't a standard English word. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a surname, a place name, or a newly coined word.  Since there's no established definition, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

However, if you meant **"Keller,"** which is a common surname, or perhaps "caller," which is a standard English word, I can provide analyses for those.  Please clarify which word you intended.

**If you meant "Keller":**

/ˈkɛlər/ | n. |凯勒（姓氏）| A surname, likely of German origin. | Example: Helen Keller was an inspiring author and activist. 海伦·凯勒是一位鼓舞人心的作家和活动家。| Example: My neighbor's name is Mr. Keller. 我的邻居叫凯勒先生。 | Synonym: (As a surname, no direct synonyms) N/A | Antonym: (As a surname, no direct antonyms) N/A | proper noun


**If you meant "caller":**

/ˈkɔːlər/ | n. |打电话的人；呼叫者| Someone who makes a telephone call. | Example: The caller identified himself as a police officer. 打电话的人自称是警察。| Example:  The caller hung up before I could answer. 打电话的人在我接电话之前就挂断了。| Synonym:  phone user, dialer | Antonym: receiver, recipient | noun



**USAGE (for "caller"):**  (Note:  "Keller" as a surname wouldn't have usage examples like a regular noun.)
