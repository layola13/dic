The word "kimu" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible that it's a misspelling, a slang term, a technical term within a specific field, a name, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you can provide more context, such as the language it's from or the situation in which you encountered it, I may be able to offer more assistance.

For example, if "kimu" is meant to be "kimono," then the analysis would be as follows:

kimono:/kɪˈmoʊnoʊ/| n.|和服|A traditional Japanese garment.|例句：She wore a beautiful silk kimono to the festival. 她穿着美丽的丝绸和服参加节日。|例句：Kimonos are often passed down through generations. 和服通常是代代相传的。|近义词：garment, attire|反义词: (No direct antonym, perhaps "Western clothing")|noun
