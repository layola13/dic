词源:
From Italian *bravo* (meaning “brave, excellent”), ultimately from Latin *bravus* (meaning “fierce, wild, savage”).  The plural form *bravi* is also sometimes used, especially in formal contexts.  However, *bravos* is now more common in English.
来源于意大利语 *bravo*（意思是“勇敢的，优秀的”），最终来自拉丁语 *bravus*（意思是“凶猛的，野蛮的”）。 复数形式 *bravi* 有时也使用，尤其是在正式场合。 然而，*bravos* 现在在英语中更常见。
