##parallaxes. |视差（复数）|视差是指观察者从两个不同位置观察同一个物体时，该物体相对于背景位置变化的现象。它在天文测量中被用来计算恒星的距离。|Parallaxes are used in astronomy to determine the distances to stars. 视差被用于天文学中来确定恒星的距离。  The parallaxes of nearby stars are relatively easy to measure. 附近恒星的视差相对容易测量。| parallax (单数) | distance, perspective |"παράλλαξις" (parallaxis), meaning "alteration," "change," or "deviation."  The term reflects the apparent shift in an object's position when viewed from different perspectives. This root is further brokendown into "παρά" (para), meaning "beside" or "alongside," and "ἀλλάξις" (allagis), meaning "change" or "exchange."  Therefore, the etymological meaning points directly to the observable change in position.  The word entered English scientific terminology throughLatin and French.the parallax angle, the closer the star.  Techniques for measuring parallaxes have become increasingly refined over time, allowing for more precise distance calculations.  The concept of parallax also finds application in other areas where perspective and relative positioning are crucial, such as surveying and photography.  However, its most prominent usage remains withinastronomy.三角视差法是确定恒星距离最直接的方法。"parallax" 单数形式，因为题目要求24个例句，而"parallaxes"用在例句中显得冗余):**This technique calculates the parallax using precise measurements. 此技术利用精确测量来计算视差。affects the accuracy of our observations. 我们正在研究视差如何影响我们观测的准确性。accuracy of parallax measurements. 我们已经成功地提高了视差测量的准确性。to map the nearby stars. 天文学家一直在使用这种技术来绘制附近恒星的地图。视差。were using a new telescope to improve our parallax calculations. 我们正在使用一台新的望远镜来改进我们的视差计算。办法测量视差。研究视差测量多年了。恒星的视差。十年我们将测量许多恒星的视差。. 到年底，我们将完成视差分析。they will have been studying parallax for over twenty years. 到2030年，他们将已经研究视差超过20年了。
