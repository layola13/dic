注意事项:

"Criming" is not a standard English word. While it's grammatically correct as a present participle of the verb "crime," it's infrequently used and might sound awkward in many contexts.  "Committing crimes," "engaging in criminal activity," or other more specific terms are generally preferred.  However, it sees some use in informal contexts.
