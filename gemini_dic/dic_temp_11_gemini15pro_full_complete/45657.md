ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *curtaillen*, from Old French *curtailler* "to dock, to shorten," from *curtail* "short, docked," from Vulgar Latin *curtus* "short," from Latin *curtus*, variant of *cors*, *cordis* "heart," so called because the heart is relatively short.  The sense development is from "shortened" to "dock (an animal's tail)" to "reduce."
