microperthitic:/ˌmaɪkroʊpərˈθɪtɪk/
adjective
微斜长石的
Characterized by microperthite, an intergrowth of two feldspars (usually albite and orthoclase) where the albite forms microscopic lamellae within the orthoclase.
The rock sample exhibited a microperthitic texture.  这块岩石样品呈现出微斜长石结构。
Synonyms: none specifically for this technical term.  Consider using terms like "intergrown," "lamellar" to describe the texture.
Antonyms: N/A (This term describes a specific texture; there's no direct opposite.)
詞性: adjective
