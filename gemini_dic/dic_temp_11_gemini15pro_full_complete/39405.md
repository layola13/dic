词源：
Possibly from the obsolete *conch*, meaning a nose or shell, later extended to the head. The sense of hitting someone on the head led to the meanings of "to knock unconscious" and "to die." The meaning related to hair straightening likely arose from the use of harsh chemicals that could damage or "kill" the hair's natural curl.
