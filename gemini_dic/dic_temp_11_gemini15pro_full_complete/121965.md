注意事项:  This word is considered informal and even somewhat old-fashioned.  Using "Mrs. [Last Name]'s" is generally preferred in formal or standard English.  The use of "missis" without the possessive 's is also less common than "Mrs."  Therefore, while grammatically correct,  "missis's" is not frequently encountered in modern English.
