词源:  "gero-" (Greek: γέρας, geras, "old age") + "-piga" may be inspired by words like "orthopigia" meaning correct posture and thus implying a healthy uprightness.  It's a relatively modern coinage and not found in traditional dictionaries.  Its usage primarily appears in academic or scientific contexts related to aging and health.
