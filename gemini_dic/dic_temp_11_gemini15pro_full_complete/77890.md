ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin genialis "festive, cheerful, marriage-," from genius "guardian deity or spirit which watches over each person from birth; a person's natural inclination."  Meaning "conducive to growth or comfort; pleasantly warm; kindly, sympathetic" developed in English c. 1600.  The noun geniality followed soon after.
