词源：harm (n.) + -ful (suffix) + -ness (suffix) + -es (plural suffix)

From Old English *hearm "injury, hurt, grief, pain," from Proto-Germanic *harmaz (source also of Old Saxon harm, Old Norse harmr, Old Frisian herm, Dutch harm, German Harm "harm, grief, sorrow"), from PIE root *ker- (1) "to grieve, cry." The -ful suffix transforms the noun "harm" into the adjective "harmful," and the -ness suffix further transforms it into the noun "harmfulness."  Finally, "-es" creates the plural form "harmfulnesses."
