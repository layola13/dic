correlator:/ˈkɒrəleɪtə(r)/ (US) /ˈkɔːrəleɪtər/ (UK)| n. |相关器，关联器|A device or program that compares two or more signals or data sets to determine the degree of correlation between them.  It finds relationships or dependencies.|例句：The correlator identified a strong link between smoking and lung cancer. 相关器发现了吸烟和肺癌之间的强关联性。

例句：The engineers used a digital correlator to analyze the radar signals. 工程师们使用数字相关器来分析雷达信号。|近义词：comparator, analyzer|反义词: N/A|词性:noun


Etymology: From the verb "correlate" + "-or" (suffix forming nouns denoting an agent or instrument).  "Correlate" comes from the Latin "correlātus," past participle of "correlāre" (to bring into mutual relation), from "com-" (together) + "relātus" (related).
