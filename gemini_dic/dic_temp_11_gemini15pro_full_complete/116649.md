词源:  "Matter-of-fact" originates from the late 16th century, combining "matter" (meaning "subject of discourse or concern") and "fact" (meaning "something that has actually occurred").  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "matter-of-fact" into the noun "matter-of-factness," denoting the quality or state of being matter-of-fact. The plural form, "matter-of-factnesses," is less common but grammatically correct, referring to multiple instances or types of this quality.
