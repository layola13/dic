ETYMOLOGY->
From anti- (against) + vaccination + -ist (one who does or believes in).  "Anti-" comes from Greek "anti" meaning "against, opposite of, instead of, in return for, in place of." "Vaccination" comes from Latin "vaccinus" meaning "from cows," originally referring to cowpox, which was used to inoculate against smallpox. "-ist" is a suffix forming agent nouns from verbs or other nouns, ultimately from Greek "-istes."
