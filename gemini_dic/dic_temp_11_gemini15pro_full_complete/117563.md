megadyne: /ˈmɛɡədaɪn/ | n. | 百万达因 | A unit of force equal to one million dynes.  A dyne is the force required to accelerate a mass of one gram at a rate of one centimeter per second squared.  It is used in the CGS (centimeter-gram-second) system of units. | The force required to lift a small object can be measured in megadynes.  | Near synonyms:  Newton (SI unit of force, 1 megadyne = 10 Newtons) | Antonyms:  (Force doesn't have a direct opposite, but one might consider forces in opposing directions.) | noun
