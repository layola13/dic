**(Note:  The original prompt requested analysis of "hydrognosy."  While "hydrognosy" is a valid, though rarely used, term, it appears the user might have intended "hydroscopy" or even "hydrogeology," given the provided definition.  Therefore, both "hydrognosy" and the more common "hydroscopy" are analyzed below.)**
