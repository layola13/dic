Etymology:
over- + coil

over-:  Old English *ofer, of Germanic origin; related to Dutch over and German über, from an Indo-European root shared by Latin super and Greek hyper.

coil:  Middle English coilen, from Old French coillir ‘collect, gather’, based on Latin colligere (see collect). The original sense was ‘gather, assemble’, hence ‘wind or twist into a continuous circular or spiral shape’.
