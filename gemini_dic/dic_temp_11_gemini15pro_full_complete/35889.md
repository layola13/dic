注意事项:

"Cocono" is not a standard English word.  The standard English terms are "cacao" (referring to the plant and its products in a more raw and unprocessed state) and "cocoa" (typically referring to the processed powder).  While "cocono" may be used informally or regionally, it's essential to be aware of the more commonly accepted terminology.
