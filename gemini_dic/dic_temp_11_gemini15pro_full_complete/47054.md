词源:  "datas" is a less common plural form of "data". "Data" comes from the Latin word "datum," meaning "something given."  Its plural in Latin is "data".  In modern English, "data" is often treated as a singular mass noun, similar to "information". Therefore, while "datas" is grammatically correct as a Latin plural, it's less frequently used than just "data" in modern English, especially in technical contexts.
