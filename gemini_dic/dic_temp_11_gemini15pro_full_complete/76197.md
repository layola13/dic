词源: From Middle French *fustaigne* (modern *futaine*), from Old Italian *fustagno*, from Medieval Latin *fustaneum*, perhaps from Fostat, Egypt, where the cloth originated. Originally referring to a type of coarse cloth, the word later came to describe language that was similarly coarse or inflated.
