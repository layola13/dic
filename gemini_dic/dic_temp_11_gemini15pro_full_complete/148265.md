Etymology:
From "over" + "slowness" + "-es" (plural suffix). "Over" acts as an intensifier, "slowness" is derived from "slow" with the suffix "-ness" indicating a state or quality, and "-es" marks the plural form.  源自“over” + “slowness” + “-es”（复数后缀）。 “over”作为增强词，“slowness”源自“slow”加上后缀“-ness”表示状态或性质，“-es”标记复数形式。
