ETYMOLOGY->
"fand" appears to be a misspelling of "fan".  The word "fan"  originates as a shortened form of "fanatic". "Fanatic" comes from the Latin "fanaticus," meaning "inspired by a deity, frenzied, enthusiastic," related to "fanum" ("temple").  The sense of "enthusiast" for something secular developed in the late 18th century.
