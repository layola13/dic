The word "manid" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a technical term, a slang word, or a word from a language other than English.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

If you can provide more context, such as where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more assistance.  For example, is it a name, an acronym, or part of a larger phrase?

However, since the prompt requested examples of grammar structures using "what," I will provide those below, assuming "what" is the word you'd like analyzed:

what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) | pronoun, determiner, adverb | 什么 | used to ask for information about something | Example: What is your name? 你叫什么名字？ | Synonyms: which, whatever | Antonyms: N/A | Pronoun, Determiner, Adverb

what: /wɒt/ (British) /wʌt/ (American) | interjection | 什么（表示惊讶或不相信） | used to express surprise or disbelief | Example: What! You won the lottery? 什么！你中彩票了？ | Synonyms: huh, really | Antonyms: N/A | Interjection
