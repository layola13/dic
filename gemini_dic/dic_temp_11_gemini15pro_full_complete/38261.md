comrogue is not a valid English word. It's likely a misspelling or a neologism (newly coined word).  If it's meant to be two words like "com rogue," it could refer to someone dishonest in the realm of "com," which might stand for "communications," "commerce," or "community."  However, without more context, it's impossible to give a definitive meaning.  I'll instead analyze a similar and more common word: **rogue**.
