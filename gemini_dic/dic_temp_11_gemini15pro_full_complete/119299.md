microa: /maɪkroʊˈeɪ/ |n.| 微A |  There doesn't seem to be a recognized English word "microa".  It's likely a misspelling or a specialized term. If referring to a very small unit of electrical current, it might be intended as "microamp" (µA), short for microampere. |  (Assuming intended word is microampere) The sensor detected a current of only 5 microamps. 传感器只检测到5微安的电流。 | Near Synonyms: (If referring to microampere) microampere, µA | Antonyms:  (If referring to microampere)  N/A | noun
