darcy:/ˈdɑːrsi/| n.|达西|A unit of permeability of porous media (such as rocks) to fluids, equal to the flow rate of one cubic centimeter per second of a fluid with one centipoise viscosity through a cross section of one square centimeter under a pressure gradient of one atmosphere per centimeter.|The permeability of the sandstone was measured in darcys.|近义词: permeability unit |反义词: (no direct antonym exists, could consider impermeability as a contrasting concept)| noun
