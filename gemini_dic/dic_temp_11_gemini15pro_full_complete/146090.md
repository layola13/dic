overeducatively (This word is not commonly used and might be considered non-standard.) It is formed from "over," "educate," and the adverbial suffix "-ly."  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "excessively" or "too much." "Educate" comes from the Latin "educatus," past participle of "educare" (to bring up, rear, educate), from "ex-" (out) and "ducere" (to lead).
