词源: From leech (n.), from Old English lǣce "physician," later also "bloodsucking worm," related to Old Norse læknir "physician," both perhaps from a Proto-Germanic *lekjaz "one who heals," from PIE root *leg- (1) "to collect, gather," with derivatives meaning "to speak (to 'pick out words')," also "to lay." The notion is perhaps of gathering herbs or ingredients for remedies.  The verb sense of "to drain, exhaust" developed from the bloodsucking worm's action.
