geometry: /dʒiˈɒmɪtri/ (British) /dʒiˈɑːmətri/ (American) | n. | 几何学 | A branch of mathematics that deals with the measurement, properties, and relationships of points, lines, angles, surfaces, and solids. | Example:  Euclidean geometry is the study of plane and solid figures. 欧几里得几何学是对平面和立体图形的研究。

Example: She excels in geometry and algebra. 她在几何和代数方面很出色。| 近义词: mensuration | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, but perhaps "amorphousness" in a philosophical context) | 词性: noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French geometrie, from Latin geōmetria, from Ancient Greek γεωμετρία (geōmetría, “geometry, land-measuring”), from γῆ (gê, “earth, land”) and μέτρον (métron, “measure”).
