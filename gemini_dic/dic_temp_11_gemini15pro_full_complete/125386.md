multimolecular:/ˌmʌltiˈməˈlɛkjʊlər/
| adj. |多分子的；由许多分子组成的|Formed by the aggregation of many molecules.  Composed of many molecules.|The formation of a multimolecular micelle involves the aggregation of many surfactant molecules.|多分子胶束的形成涉及许多表面活性剂分子的聚集。|polymolecular|monomolecular|adjective


ETYMOLOGY->
From multi- + molecular.  "Multi-" is a combining form meaning "many," derived from Latin *multus* "much, many." "Molecular" relates to or consists of molecules, from molecule + -ar.  The word "molecule" comes from French *molécule*, a diminutive of Latin *moles* "mass, barrier."
