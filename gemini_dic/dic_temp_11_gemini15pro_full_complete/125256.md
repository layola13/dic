ETYMOLOGY->

From multi- + drug.  "Multi-" is a combining form meaning "many," "multiple," or "occurring many times," derived from Latin "multus" meaning "much" or "many." "Drug" comes from Old French "drogue" of uncertain origin, possibly related to Middle Dutch "droge vate," meaning "dried barrel," referring to dried herbs and other medicinal substances stored in barrels.
