PHRASE->
(This word is not commonly used in phrases in modern English, especially outside of legal contexts.  Therefore, providing common phrases is difficult and potentially misleading.  Focusing on its legal usage is more accurate.)

  However, one could construct phrases like:

"The report detailed how the defendant devastavit the trust fund." = 报告详细说明了被告如何挥霍了信托基金。
"The legal team argued that the executor had devastavit the estate." = 法律团队辩称执行人浪费了遗产。
"He was accused of devastavit, having mismanaged the company's finances." = 他被指控挥霍，管理公司财务不善。

注意事项:

This word is archaic and primarily found in legal contexts.  Its modern usage is extremely limited.  While grammatically correct example sentences can be constructed for various tenses, they often sound unnatural and forced.  It is crucial to understand its specific legal meaning related to the mismanagement and wasting of assets.
