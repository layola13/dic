nonresiduals:/nɒn.rɪˈzɪdʒ.u.əlz/ | n. | 非残差，非残值 |  Values that are not residuals, often representing the predicted values in a statistical model.  They are the opposite of residuals, which represent the difference between observed and predicted values. | The nonresiduals, representing the model's predictions, closely followed the actual sales figures. 非残差，代表模型的预测，与实际销售数据非常接近。

The nonresiduals showed a clear upward trend, indicating the model captured the underlying growth pattern. 非残差显示出明显的上升趋势，表明该模型捕捉到了潜在的增长模式。| 近义词: predicted values, fitted values | 反义词: residuals | 词性: 名词
