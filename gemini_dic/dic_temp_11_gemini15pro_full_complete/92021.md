hyperoxymuriate:/ˌhaɪpərˈɒksɪˈmjʊəriˌeɪt/ /ˌhaɪpərˈɑːksiˈmjʊəriˌeɪt/
noun|高氯酸盐|A salt of chloric acid, containing the ClO4− anion.  Specifically, it refers to potassium perchlorate (KClO4) when used in older texts.|Potassium hyperoxymuriate was used in early pyrotechnics.|Synonym: perchlorate|Antonym: N/A|n.

ETYMOLOGY->
From hyper- (Greek: 'over, beyond') + oxy- (Greek: 'sharp, acid') + muriate (from muriatic acid, an old name for hydrochloric acid). The term reflects an outdated understanding of chlorine's oxidation states.
