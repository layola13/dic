ETYMOLOGY->
From mis- (prefix meaning 'wrongly' or 'badly') + fielding (from field (v.) meaning 'to catch or stop a ball in a sport').  The prefix "mis-" comes from Old English "mis-" meaning "wrongly, badly, astray," from Proto-Germanic "*missa-" (source also of Old Saxon "missi," Old Frisian "miss-," Old Norse "mis-," Dutch "mis-," German "miß-," Gothic "missa-"). The word "field" comes from Old English "feld" meaning "open country, piece of land free from wood."
