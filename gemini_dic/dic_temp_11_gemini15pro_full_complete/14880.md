ayenward: /ˈeɪənwərd/ | adv. | 向前，朝着前方 |  This word appears to be a non-standard or archaic variant of "forward" or "onward," meaning in a direction to the front or ahead.  Its etymology likely combines "a" (a preposition often meaning "on" or "to") with "yen" (an archaic word meaning "eager" or "desirous") and "ward" (a suffix indicating direction). However, this is speculative due to the word's rarity. |  He looked ayenward to the future with hope. 他满怀希望地展望未来。 |  The ship sailed ayenward through the storm.  这艘船顶着风暴向前航行。 | 近义词: forward, onward, ahead | 反义词: backward, astern | 词性: 副词
