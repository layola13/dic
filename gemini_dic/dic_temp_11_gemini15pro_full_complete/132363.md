PHRASE->
(This word doesn't typically appear in common phrases. It's more often used in formal contexts discussing decision-making processes.)

词源:
"Non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "deliberation" (from Latin "deliberationem," meaning "weighing out, considering").  Therefore, "nondeliberations" signifies the absence of deliberation.
