词源：From the verb "bitch," which originates from the Old English word "bicce," meaning "female dog."  The pejorative use of the term to refer to a woman likely developed later. The noun and adjective forms, "bitching," likely evolved from the verb, referring to the act of complaining or scolding like a dog's persistent barking.
