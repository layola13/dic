euganoidei:/ˌjuːɡəˈnɔɪdiːaɪ/ | n. | 硬鳞鱼类 | An archaic taxonomic group of ray-finned fishes characterized by ganoid scales, now considered paraphyletic and typically divided into several distinct orders.  These fish often have thick, diamond-shaped scales and some primitive skeletal features. | Example: Euganoidei were once thought to be a single, unified group, but modern research has revealed their more complex evolutionary history. 硬鳞鱼类曾被认为是一个单一的统一群体，但现代研究揭示了它们更复杂的进化史。

Example:  The group formerly known as Euganoidei includes fishes like gars and sturgeons.  以前被称为硬鳞鱼类的群体包括雀鳝和鲟鱼。 | 近义词: ganoid fishes | 反义词:  (No direct antonym; could use teleosts (真骨鱼类) for contrast as a more derived group) | 词性: noun
