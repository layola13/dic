orthogneiss: /ˈɔːrθoʊnaɪs/ | n. | 正片麻岩 | A metamorphic rock formed by the alteration of igneous rock, typically granite.  It is characterized by banded texture and a mineral composition similar to the original igneous rock. | The geologist identified the sample as orthogneiss due to its granitic composition and banded structure.  地质学家根据其花岗岩成分和带状结构将样品鉴定为正片麻岩。

The orthogneiss cliffs provided a challenging climb for the experienced mountaineers.  正片麻岩峭壁为经验丰富的登山者提供了具有挑战性的攀登。 | 近义词: gneiss(泛指片麻岩) | 反义词: None (没有直接的反义词，可以考虑一些沉积岩如sandstone 砂岩, limestone 石灰岩) | 词性: noun
