The word "lyden" does not appear to be a standard English word. It might be a misspelling, a regional variation, a slang term, or a word from another language.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  However, if you meant "lidden," which is an archaic past participle of "lide" (meaning "to travel"), I can provide information on that.

PHRASE->
"Lidden" is archaic and doesn't have common modern phrases associated with it.  The original verb, "lide," might have been used in phrases related to travel or journeys, but these would also be archaic.


注意事项:  As "lidden" is archaic, its usage is extremely limited in modern English.  You would likely only encounter it in very old texts.
