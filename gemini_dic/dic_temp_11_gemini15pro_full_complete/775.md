词源：  Although listed in some dictionaries, "absonous" is likely a relatively recent coinage and not widely used.  It appears to be formed by analogy with words like "absurd" and "sonorous," perhaps implying a notion of something sounding foolish or unreasonable.  It does not have a recognized etymology in established sources like the Oxford English Dictionary.  Therefore, while usable, it is advisable to use more established synonyms like "absurd" or "ridiculous" in formal writing.
