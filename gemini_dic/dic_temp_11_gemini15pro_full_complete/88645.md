ETYMOLOGY->
The origin of the word "hoagie" is uncertain, but the most widely accepted theory connects it to the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard during World War I.  Workers there, known as "hoggies" because they ate so much, would buy large sandwiches from Italian vendors. These sandwiches eventually became known as "hoagies."  Another theory suggests a connection to the Hog Island shipyard, also in Philadelphia.
