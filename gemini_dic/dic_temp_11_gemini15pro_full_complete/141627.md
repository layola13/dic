optics's:/ˈɒptɪksɪz/ | n. | 光学（的）|  A possessive form of "optics," which itself is generally treated as singular and uncountable, referring to the branch of physics concerned with the properties and behavior of light.  The use of "optics's" is grammatically questionable and generally avoided; "of optics" is preferred. | The optics's principles are fundamental to understanding vision. (Generally avoided - better: The principles of optics are fundamental...) | 近义词:  (None for the possessive form, but for "optics": optical science) | 反义词: (None) | 词性: Noun (possessive, though non-standard)
