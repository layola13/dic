mannide:/ˈmænɪdaɪd/ | n. | 甘露醇酐 | A white crystalline anhydride of mannitol, C6H10O4, formed by the removal of two molecules of water from mannitol. It is used in the manufacture of resins and plasticizers. | Mannitol can be dehydrated to form mannide. 甘露醇可以脱水形成甘露醇酐。|  Mannitol is used as a diuretic, while mannide is used in polymer synthesis. 甘露醇用作利尿剂，而甘露醇酐用于聚合物合成。 | synonyms: 1,4:3,6-dianhydro-D-mannitol | antonyms:  (No direct antonyms exist for a chemical compound. One might consider mannitol as a related opposite since it is the hydrated form.) | noun
