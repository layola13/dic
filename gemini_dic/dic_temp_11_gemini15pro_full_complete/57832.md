词源:  The origin is uncertain, but it's thought to be related to the highest level of quality or perfection.  One theory connects it to the nine Muses of Greek mythology, representing the pinnacle of artistic inspiration. Another theory points to tailors requiring nine yards of fabric to make the finest suits.  While the exact etymology remains a mystery, the phrase clearly denotes a high degree of formality and stylishness in dress.
