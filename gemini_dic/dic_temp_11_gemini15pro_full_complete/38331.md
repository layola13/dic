注意事项: "Conceiting" as a verb is becoming archaic and rarely used in modern English.  The noun form "conceit" and the adjective "conceited" are much more common.  Therefore, many of the example sentences, especially in the future tenses, sound unnatural and are provided only to fulfill the prompt's requirements.  In actual usage, alternative phrasing with "conceited" or other synonyms would be preferred.
