-ller (This is not a standalone word in English.  It is usually a suffix or part of a larger word)

Since "-ller" isn't a word itself, I can't provide definitions, synonyms, antonyms, etc.  However, I can explain its common usage as a suffix and provide examples of words containing it, along with their etymologies and usage.

"-ller" often comes from the agentive suffix "-er" added to words ending in "l," sometimes with a doubling of the "l" for pronunciation or emphasis. The suffix "-er" transforms verbs into nouns signifying the person or thing that performs the action.
