Etymology:  brain + dead.  "Dead" has its origins in Old English "dēad," meaning "dead, lifeless."  "Brain" comes from Old English "brægen," meaning the organ inside the head. The compound term "brain-dead" emerged in the mid-20th century with advancements in medical technology that allowed for the determination of brain death.
