近义词: doting, pampering, spoiling
反义词: neglect, indifference
词性: n.

Etymology:
From "over" (excessive) + "liking" (fondness).  "Over-" acts as a prefix intensifying the meaning of "liking."  The "-ing" suffix transforms the verb "like" into a gerund or verbal noun, representing the act or state of liking excessively.
