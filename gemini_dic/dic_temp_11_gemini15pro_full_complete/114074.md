magnetomotive:/ˌmæɡˌniːtəˈmoʊtɪv/
adjective|磁动势的|Relating to or producing magnetomotive force, which is the force that produces magnetic flux. |The magnetomotive force is the driving force that establishes the magnetic flux in a magnetic circuit. 磁动势是在磁路中建立磁通量的驱动力。|Synonym: magnetizing|Antonym: Non-magnetizing
word type: adjective

Etymology:
From magneto- + motive.  "Magneto-" comes from the Greek "magnēs" meaning magnet. "Motive" comes from Latin "motivus," meaning "moving, impelling."
