dereferencing:/ˌdiːˈrɛfərənsɪŋ/
|n.|解引用，指针取值|Accessing the value stored at the memory location pointed to by a pointer.  It involves retrieving the data that a pointer "points" to.|`int x = 10; int *ptr = &x; int value = *ptr; // dereferencing ptr to get the value of x`  `value` now holds 10, which is the value at the memory location pointed to by `ptr`.| 中文：`int x = 10; int *ptr = &x; int value = *ptr; // 解引用 ptr 以获取 x 的值` `value` 现在保存 10，这是 `ptr` 指向的内存位置的值。|Synonyms: indirection, pointer access|Antonyms: referencing, address-of|noun
