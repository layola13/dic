butteriness's:/ˈbʌtərɪnɪsɪz/ | n. | 奶油味；油腻感；黄油味 | The quality of resembling or containing butter, often referring to taste, texture, or appearance. | The butteriness's of the croissant was exquisite.  牛角面包的奶油味真是棒极了。 | 近义词: richness, creaminess, fattiness | 反义词: dryness, staleness | 词性: 名词


词源: butter (n.) + -y (adj. suffix) + -ness (n. suffix) + -'s (possessive suffix)

From "butter" (Old English butere, from Latin butyrum, from Greek boutyron), meaning a fatty food churned from milk or cream. The suffix "-y" forms an adjective meaning "having the qualities of butter,"  "-ness" creates the noun form of this adjective, and "-'s" indicates possession, though in this unusual case it likely implies a further emphasis or nuance of the quality.  While grammatically possible, "butteriness's" is rarely used and often considered redundant or awkward.  "Butteriness" itself effectively conveys the intended meaning.
