Etymology:
From far-reaching + -ness.  Far-reaching itself comes from far + reaching (present participle of reach).  "Far" traces back to Old English "feorr," meaning "at a distance." "Reach" comes from Old English "rǣcan," meaning "to stretch, extend." The suffix "-ness" forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
