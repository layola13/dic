ETYMOLOGY->
The etymology of "chav" is uncertain, but one popular theory links it to the Romani word "chavi," meaning "child." This connection might reflect the perceived youthfulness of those labelled as "chavs." Another theory suggests a link to the Chatham area of Kent, England, where the term may have originated.  The origin remains a subject of debate among etymologists.
