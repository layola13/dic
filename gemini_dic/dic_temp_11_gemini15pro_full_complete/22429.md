ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *boken*, from Old English *bōcian* (“to grant by charter, to convey by writing, to book”), from *bōc* (“book, writing, charter”), from Proto-Germanic *bōkō* (“beech, writing tablet, book”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰeh₂ǵos* (“beech”). Cognate with Dutch *boeken* (“to book”), German *buchen* (“to book, to register”), Old Norse *bók* (“book”).  The original sense was "to register in a book," hence "to engage or reserve."
