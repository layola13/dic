monothetic:/ˌmɒnəˈθɛtɪk/ | adj. | 单系的，单性状的 | Formed by or relating to a single defining property; characterized by having a single shared characteristic that defines the group. | Example: A monothetic group is defined by having a single shared characteristic. 单系群体的定义是具有单一的共同特征。

Example: The classification of bacteria based solely on gram staining would be a monothetic approach.  仅仅基于革兰氏染色的细菌分类将是一种单性状的方法。 | 近义词: homogeneous, uniform | 反义词: polythetic, heterogeneous | 词性: adjective

词源: From Greek *monos* "single" + *thesis* "placing, position."
