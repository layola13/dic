ETYMOLOGY->

From Old English *friþu (peace), from Proto-Germanic *friþuz (peace), from Proto-Indo-European *prī-tu- (free).  Cognate with Old Norse friðr (peace), Old High German fridu (peace), Gothic freidu (peace). The sense of "wooded area" likely developed from the idea of a place of peace and safety.
