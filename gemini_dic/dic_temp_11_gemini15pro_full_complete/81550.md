ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *greihound, *grehound, from Old English grīghund. The first element is of uncertain origin.  The second element is from Old English hund (“dog”).  A popular, but now discredited, theory is that the name comes from its original use in hunting the grey crane (as opposed to the common crane).  More likely related to Old Norse grey (“bitch, female dog”).
