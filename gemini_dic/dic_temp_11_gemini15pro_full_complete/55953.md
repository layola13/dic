词源:  The name "Djibouti" is of uncertain origin.  Some believe it derives from the Afar word "gabouti," meaning "flat basket," referring to the flat coastal plain. Others suggest it comes from the Somali word "jabuuti," which could mean "place of the djinn" or "the devil's cauldron," perhaps referring to the geothermal activity in the area.
