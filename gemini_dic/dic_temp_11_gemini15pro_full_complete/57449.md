Etymology:
From "Dracula," the name of the titular vampire in Bram Stoker's 1897 novel. The name "Dracula" itself is derived from the Romanian word "dracul," meaning "dragon" or "devil," originally a surname meaning "son of Dracul" (Vlad Dracul being the father of Vlad the Impaler, the historical figure who inspired Stoker's character).  The plural form "draculas" simply adds "-s" to denote multiple Draculas.
