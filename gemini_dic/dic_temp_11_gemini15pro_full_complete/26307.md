Etymology:
From Middle English *buxom, from Old English *būhsum (“pliant, obedient, obliging”), from *būgan (“to bend, bow, submit”) + *-sum.  The original meaning was "obedient, submissive," later evolving to "kind, cheerful, lively," and finally settling on the current meaning related to physical appearance, likely influenced by the association with a healthy and thriving body.
