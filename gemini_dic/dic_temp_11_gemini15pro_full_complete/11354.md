注意事项:
"Aren't" is specifically the contraction of "are not" and cannot be used with other pronouns like "I," "he," "she," or "it," nor with plural nouns in standard English.  While "aren't I" is sometimes used informally in questions like "Aren't I clever?", it's grammatically incorrect and should be avoided in formal writing.  The correct form is "Am I not...?" although it sounds very formal.
