Etymology: A blend of "business" and "buzz."  "Business" traces back to Middle English "bisinesse" meaning "anxiety, occupation, diligence," ultimately from Old English "bisig" meaning "busy, anxious, careful." "Buzz" originated in the 16th century, imitating the sound of bees, and later came to mean a low murmur or hum, extending to excited talk or gossip.
