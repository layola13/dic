Etymology: From Middle English *dister*, from Old French *destrier* "war-horse", from Late Latin *dextrarius* "right-handed, on the right side" (because the war-horse was led on the right), from Latin *dexter* "right, skillful". The semantic shift from "war-horse" to "disaster" occurred through the influence of Italian *disastro* "ill-starred, unfavorable," ultimately from Latin *dis-*, "apart, away" + *astro* "star."  Originally referring to an unfavorable astrological aspect, it broadened to encompass any great misfortune.
