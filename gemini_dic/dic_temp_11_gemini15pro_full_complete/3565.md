词源：
From Ancient Greek ἀγάπη (agápē, “love”).

用法说明:

"Agapae's" is the possessive form of "agapae," which itself is the plural of "agape."  "Agape" refers to a love feast, especially one held by early Christians in connection with the Eucharist. Therefore, "agapae's" means "belonging to the agapae" or "of the agapae."  It is rarely used in modern English.  The singular possessive, "agape's," is more common.
