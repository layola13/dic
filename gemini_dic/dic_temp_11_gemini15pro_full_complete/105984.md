ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *knakeren, from Old Norse *hnakkari (“saddle maker”), from hnakki (“nape of the neck”).  The original meaning referred to a harness maker and later evolved to include horse slaughterers. The meaning then broadened to encompass dealing in scrap and finally to general exhaustion or breakdown.
