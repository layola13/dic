PHRASE->
(Since Mendes is a proper noun, particularly a surname,  it doesn't typically have common phrase pairings. The examples below are contrived to illustrate hypothetical usage, particularly if "Mendes" referred to something other than a surname, which is unlikely.)

注意事项:

As Mendes is primarily a surname, its grammatical usage is limited to the contexts of naming and referring to individuals or families bearing that name.  It would be unusual to use "Mendes" in verb tenses, unless in a context where the name has been adopted for something else (e.g., a company, a product, a technique).
