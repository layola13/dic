ETYMOLOGY->
From "camp" (adjective and noun), meaning something so outrageously artificial, affected, theatrical, or out-of-date that it's considered amusing. "Camp" likely originated in gay subculture and became more mainstream in the mid-20th century.  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "campy" into the noun "campiness," indicating the quality or state of being camp.
