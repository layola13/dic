词源：
From Middle English *masti, *mastif, from Old French mastin, from Late Latin *mansutinus (“house-guard dog”), from Latin mansio (“staying, dwelling”).  Influence from Old English māstiġ (“fattened, crammed”) is possible.  Meaning "stale, musty" is perhaps from "masty dog" (a hunting dog kept in a kennel), hence associated with unpleasant smells.  Obscene sense is from 1920s.
