注意事项:
词源：The origin of "muggins" is uncertain, but it is thought to be related to "mug," meaning "face," and may have originally referred to a person with a foolish or gullible expression.  Another theory connects it to the game of cribbage, where "muggins" is a scoring term.  It entered common usage in the late 19th century.
