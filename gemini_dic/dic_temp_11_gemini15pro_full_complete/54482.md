词源:

From dis- + interesting.  "Dis-" is a prefix meaning "not" or "opposite of".


注意事项:  Disinteresting is often confused with disinterested, which means impartial or unbiased. While some dictionaries list "not interested" as a definition of disinteresting, this usage is often considered incorrect and can lead to ambiguity.  It is generally better to use "uninterested" if you mean "not interested".
