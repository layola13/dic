词源：Derf is back slang for "fred," a common name, which in turn might be related to "fraid," meaning timid or shy.  The inversion of the letters implies a reversal of the usual qualities associated with the name, leading to the meaning of "awkward" or "clumsy." derf是fred（一个常见的名字）的反向俚语，而fred可能与fraid（意为胆怯或害羞）有关。字母的倒置意味着与名字相关的通常品质的逆转，导致“笨拙”或“粗俗”的意思。
