hypodicrotous:/ˌhaɪpəˈdɪkrətəs/
adjective
次摆线分支的;近似次摆线的
having or relating to a secondary pulse or dicrotism in the arterial pulse wave.
A hypodicrotous pulse is characterized by a secondary upstroke on the descending limb of the pulse wave. This secondary wave is less pronounced than the primary wave.  This can be indicative of certain cardiovascular conditions.
The physician noted a hypodicrotous pulse in the patient, suggesting a possible issue with aortic regurgitation.
近义词: dicrotic (although dicrotic implies a more pronounced secondary wave)
反义词: monocrotous (having a single pulse wave)
