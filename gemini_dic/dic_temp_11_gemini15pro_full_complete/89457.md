词源:  From Middle English *honestee, honeste, from Old French onesteté, honesté, from Latin honestās (“honor, respectability, reputation, virtue”), from honestus.

注意事项:
* "Honesties" is not commonly used.  "Honesty" is usually uncountable.  Using the plural can sound unnatural or slightly archaic in modern English.  It is more natural to talk about "acts of honesty" or "demonstrations of honesty".
