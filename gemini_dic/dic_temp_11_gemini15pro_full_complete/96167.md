词源:
From independent + -s (plural suffix).  "Independent" traces back to the late Middle English "independant," borrowed from the Medieval Latin "independentem," the accusative singular of "independens," meaning "not dependent."  This Latin word is formed from "in-" (meaning "not") + "dependens" (meaning "hanging down" or "dependent").
