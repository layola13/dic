##parapectin:/ˌpærəˈpɛktɪn/ | n. | 半乳糖醛酸聚糖 |  果胶质的一种，在果胶酸盐中发现的中间产物 | Parapectin is a type of pectin found as an intermediate product in pectate.  It differsslightly in structure from ordinary pectin. | 近义词：pectin (果胶) | 反义词：无ectin is a complex carbohydrate, specifically a type of pectin.  Pectins are a family of polysaccharides (long chains of sugar molecules) that occur naturally in the cell walls of plants, particularly in fruits and vegetables.  They contributeto the firmness and structure of plant tissues. Parapectin is an intermediate product formed during the breakdown or processing of pectin.  While the exact chemical structure can vary slightly depending on the source and processing, it's generally characterized as apartially degraded form of pectin, often lacking some of the methyl ester groups found in fully methylated pectins. Its properties, therefore, might differ from the standard pectin.   Chemically, parapectin is closely related to pectinic acid and pectic acid, representing a stage in the progressive hydrolysis (breakdown) of thepectin molecule.the amount of parapectin present influences the texture and gelling properties of the final product in jam production. (研究表明，果酱生产中存在的半乳糖醛酸聚糖的量会影响最终产品的质地和胶凝特性。)derived from "pectin" (果胶) and the prefix "para-," which in this context indicates a similar or related substance, but not identical.  The term implies a substance that is alongside or closely associated with pectin, exhibiting related chemical properties but differing subtly in structure or function.  Pectin itself derivesfrom the Greek word  πήκτωσις (pēktos), meaning “concocted” or “curdled,” reflecting its ability to form gels.  Therefore, the entire evolution shows a connection to the traditional understanding of a substance within the broader pectin family, possessing a comparable chemical nature.用法说明:**or modification.  The context in which it appears often involves discussions on enzymatic activity, degradation pathways of pectin, or the chemical properties of various pectin components.
