aciculite: /əˈsɪkjʊˌlaɪt/
n.
针状沸石岩
A rock composed of acicular crystals, often zeolites.
Aciculite is a type of rock formed from needle-like crystals, often zeolites, which are hydrated aluminosilicate minerals.  针状沸石岩是一种由针状晶体组成的岩石，通常是沸石，即水合铝硅酸盐矿物。
This geological formation is primarily composed of aciculite. 这种地质构造主要由针状沸石岩组成。
The aciculite in this area is known for its unique crystal formations.  该地区的针状沸石岩以其独特的晶体结构而闻名。
近义词: needle stone (非专业术语)
反义词: N/A (没有明确的反义词)
词性: noun


词源:
From Latin acicula ("small needle") + -ite (suffix forming nouns denoting rocks or minerals). 由拉丁语acicula（“小针”）+ -ite（构成表示岩石或矿物的名词的后缀）组成。
