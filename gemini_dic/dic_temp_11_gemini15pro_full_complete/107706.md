lantanuric: /ˌlæntəˈnjuːrɪk/
adjective
镧尿的
Relating to or characterized by the presence of lanthanum in the urine.  Lanthanum is a rare earth element.  Its presence in urine is typically unusual and could be indicative of exposure to lanthanum compounds.
Example: Lantanuric excretion was observed in the test subjects after administration of lanthanum carbonate.  服用碳酸镧后，在测试对象中观察到镧尿排泄。
Example: Further research is needed to fully understand the implications of lantanuric findings. 需要进一步研究以充分理解镧尿发现的意义。
Near Synonyms:  (No direct synonyms exist due to the specific nature of the term.  One could consider synonyms related to the broader concept of the presence of metals in urine, but these would not be precise.)  例如：metallicuria (金属尿), but this is a much broader term.
Antonyms: (No direct antonyms exist)
词性: adjective
