ETYMOLOGY->
From mis- + focussing, where mis- is a prefix indicating "wrongly" or "badly," and focussing comes from "focus," ultimately derived from the Latin "focus" meaning "hearth, fireplace." The semantic shift occurred as the term came to represent a point of convergence, like light rays or attention.
