nonsynchronic:/ˌnɒnˌsɪŋˈkrɒnɪk/ | adj. | 非同步的，不同时的 | Not occurring at the same time; not synchronized. | Example: The two events were nonsynchronic, happening days apart. 这两个事件是非同步的，相隔数天发生。 | Example:  Nonsynchronic data collection can lead to inaccurate results. 非同步的数据收集会导致结果不准确。 | 近义词: asynchronous, nonsimultaneous | 反义词: synchronous, simultaneous | 词性: adjective

Etymology:  "non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "synchronic" (from Greek "syn-" meaning "together" and "chronos" meaning "time").  Therefore, it literally means "not together in time."
