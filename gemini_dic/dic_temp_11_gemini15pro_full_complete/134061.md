nonignitibilities:/ˌnɒnɪɡˌnɪtɪˈbɪlɪtiz/| n.|不可燃性；不燃性|The nonignitibilities of these materials make them suitable for use in fire-resistant clothing.|These new materials boast high nonignitibilities, making them ideal for construction in fire-prone areas.|近义词：incombustibility, fire resistance|反义词: flammability, combustibility|词性:noun


词源:
From non- + ignitibility.  "Ignitibility" comes from the Late Latin "ignitibilitas,"  from Latin "ignitus" (set on fire), past participle of "ignire" (to set on fire), from "ignis" (fire).
