nonpotentials:/ˌnɒnpəˈtɛnʃəlz/ | n. | 非势函数，非位函数 |  Functions that cannot be expressed as the gradient of a scalar field. These often arise in areas like electromagnetism when dealing with non-conservative forces. |  The magnetic vector potential, while useful, is a nonpotential because the magnetic field is not a conservative force.  | Non-conservative fields are described by nonpotentials. | Near synonyms: non-conservative fields, non-gradient functions | Antonym: potentials, conservative fields | noun

nonpotential:/ˌnɒnpəˈtɛnʃəl/ | adj. | 非势的，非位的 | Describing a vector field that cannot be expressed as the gradient of a scalar field.  | The electric field within a battery is nonpotential. | The induced electric field due to a changing magnetic field is nonpotential. | Near synonyms:  non-conservative, non-gradient, rotational | Antonym: potential, conservative, irrotational | adjective
