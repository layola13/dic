ETYMOLOGY->
From Old North French *gaviel, diminutive of Old French gavele "mallet" (Modern French javelle "bundle of stalks, sheaf"), from Frankish *gabila, from Proto-Germanic *gabulō.  Related to Old English gafol "tax, tribute, rent" (from which modern English gavelkind "equal division of property among heirs" is derived). The sense shifted from "mallet" to specifically the mallet used by a presiding officer.
