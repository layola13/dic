词源:
cockney + -fied.  "Cockney" originally referred to a "cock's egg," a misshapen or abnormal egg, and later came to be associated with city dwellers, particularly those in London's East End.  The suffix "-fied" means "to make or become."  Thus, "cockneyfied" means to have become like a Cockney, or to have adopted Cockney characteristics.
