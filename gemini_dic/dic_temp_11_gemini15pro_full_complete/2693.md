ETYMOLOGY->
From French *adroit*, from Old French *a droit* "according to right, properly," from *a* "to" (from Latin *ad*) + *droit* "right," from Latin *directum* "straight," past participle of *dirigere* "to direct," from *dis-* "apart" + *regere* "to guide, rule."  The sense evolution was from "right, correct" to "skillful, dexterous."
