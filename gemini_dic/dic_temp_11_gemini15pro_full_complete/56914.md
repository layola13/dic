The word "dotary" does not exist in standard English dictionaries.  It's possible there's a misspelling, or it's a very niche technical term. Did you perhaps mean "dotiary," "dottery," or "rotary"?  I can provide analyses for these words.

Assuming you meant **"dotary,"** and treating it as a hypothetical word related to "dote" (to be excessively fond of), here's a possible analysis:

**If you meant "dottery":**

dottery: /ˈdɒtəri/ | adj. |  老糊涂的，衰老的 | Showing signs of mental decline associated with old age.  |  His dottery uncle often forgot where he put his glasses. 他那老糊涂的叔叔经常忘记把眼镜放在哪里了。 | She became increasingly dottery in her later years.  晚年她越来越老糊涂了。 | 近义词: senile, confused, forgetful | 反义词: lucid, sharp | 词性: adjective

**If you meant "rotary":**

rotary: /ˈroʊtəri/ | adj. | 旋转的，转动的 | Turning or capable of turning around a central point or axis. | The rotary motion of the blades created a strong wind. 叶片的旋转运动产生了一股强风。 | The rotary engine is a type of internal combustion engine. 转子发动机是一种内燃机。 | 近义词: rotating, revolving, circular | 反义词: stationary, fixed | 词性: adjective
