nonseptate:/nɒnˈsɛpteɪt/
adjective
无隔膜的，无隔的
Lacking septa or partitions.  A nonseptate fungus, for example, has hyphae that lack internal cross-walls.
The fungus was identified as nonseptate, meaning its hyphae lacked dividing walls.  这种真菌被鉴定为无隔膜的，意味着它的菌丝缺乏分隔墙。
Nonseptate hyphae allow rapid cytoplasmic streaming throughout the mycelium. 无隔菌丝允许细胞质在整个菌丝体中快速流动。
synonym: aseptate, coenocytic
antonym: septate
adjective
