cornific:/kɔːrˈnɪfɪk/
adjective
producing horns; horn-making
Capable of producing horns or horn-like growths.  This word is very rarely used.
There is no widely accepted scientific literature that uses "cornific" in the context of actual horn production. It is more of a theoretical or literary term.  Consider using "keratinizing" or a phrase like "horn-producing" instead.
No common examples exist due to the word's rarity. A contrived example:  "The cornific properties of the creature's cells allowed it to regrow its broken horn."
Near Synonyms: keratinizing, horn-producing
Antonyms:  None readily available.
word type: adjective
