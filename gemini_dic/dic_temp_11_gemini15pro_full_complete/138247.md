Note:  The word "nostrum's" is grammatically incorrect as "nostrum" itself implies a possessive sense ("our remedy").  Using the possessive "s" is redundant. The correct form is simply "nostrum" or "nostrums" for the plural.  However, the prompt specifically requested the analysis of "nostrum's", so this analysis accommodates that request while acknowledging the grammatical redundancy.
