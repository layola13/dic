actinosome: /ˈæktɪnəˌsoʊm/
n.
放射体，轴丝体
A radiating structure found in certain heliozoans, composed of microtubules that extend outward from the cell body.
Actinosomes, radiating from the heliozoan, help it capture prey.  放射体从太阳虫的身体辐射开来，帮助它捕获猎物。
Synonyms: axopodia (though not entirely synonymous as axopodia refer to the individual projections, while actinosome refers to the entire structure)
Antonyms: N/A (lack of a structure isn't a direct antonym)
noun
