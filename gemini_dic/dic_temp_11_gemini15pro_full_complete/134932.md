nonmyelinated:/ˌnɒnˈmaɪəlɪneɪtɪd/ | adj. | 无髓鞘的 | lacking a myelin sheath (a fatty insulating layer that surrounds the axon of some nerve fibers and increases the speed of nerve impulse conduction) |  Nonmyelinated nerve fibers conduct impulses more slowly. 无髓神经纤维传导冲动更慢。| 近义词: unmyelinated | 反义词: myelinated | 词性: 形容词

词源:
non- (prefix):  meaning "not"  来自拉丁语 non
myelin (noun): referring to the fatty substance forming the myelin sheath  来自希腊语 myelós, meaning "marrow"
-ated (suffix): forming an adjective, meaning "having" or "provided with"
