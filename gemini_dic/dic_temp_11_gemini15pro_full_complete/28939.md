PHRASE->
(This word is not commonly used in phrases.  Here are some examples of how it *could* be used, but they sound unnatural and are not recommended.)
a carroted hue =  胡萝卜色
carroted vegetables = 加了胡萝卜的蔬菜
a dish carroted with spices =  加了胡萝卜和香料的菜
carroted juice = 胡萝卜汁 (though "carrot juice" is much more common and natural)

注意事项: "carroted" is not a frequently used word. While grammatically correct, it often sounds less natural than alternatives like "carrot-colored" or phrases like "flavored with carrots."  It's most commonly used to describe color.  Using it to describe adding carrots to something is less common and may sound awkward.
