ETYMOLOGY->
"overnearnesses" is derived from "overnearness," which itself is formed by the prefix "over-" (meaning "excessive" or "too much") and the word "nearness" (meaning "the state of being near").

"over-" comes from Old English "ofer," meaning "above, beyond, across."

"nearness" comes from Old English "nēarness," derived from "nēah" (near) and the suffix "-ness" (denoting a state or quality).
