注意事项:  "bella" itself isn't commonly used as a standalone word in English. Its primary usage is as a term of endearment, often within Italian phrases or by those familiar with Italian culture. While it translates to "beautiful," it’s more nuanced than simply calling someone beautiful. It carries a sense of affection and admiration.
