词源：
The word "cod" for the fish comes from the Middle English *codde* and Old Norse *koddi*.  The verb "to cod" meaning to deceive or joke likely developed from the idea of telling tall tales about fishing expeditions, similar to how "fishing for compliments" implies seeking praise through indirect means.  The precise connection is uncertain, but this is a plausible theory.
