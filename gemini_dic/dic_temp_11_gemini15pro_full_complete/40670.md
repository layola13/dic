PHRASE->
Not applicable. "Conversably" is an adverb and doesn't typically form set phrases.  It describes the manner of speaking, rather than forming a specific idiomatic expression.


词源：From "converse" + "-ably". "Converse" comes from Old French "converser," from Latin "conversari" meaning "to keep company with, dwell with, live with."  "-ably" is a suffix meaning "in a manner that can be."
