famoused:/ˈfeɪməst/| adj.|著名的，有名的 (非标准用法，建议使用 famous)|This usage is considered non-standard. It's better to use "famous".  This word is likely a mistaken back-formation from the noun "famousness".|He was famoused for his bravery. (Non-standard) 他因其勇敢而出名。|近义词：famous, renowned, celebrated|反义词：unknown, obscure|词性:形容词

Etymology:  Likely a back-formation from "famousness," meaning the state of being famous. The suffix "-ed" is typically used to form adjectives from verbs (e.g., "walked," "learned"), but in this case, it's incorrectly applied to a noun.
