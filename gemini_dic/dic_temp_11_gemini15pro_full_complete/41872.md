cosecant: /koʊˈsiːkənt/| n.|余割|The cosecant of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the hypotenuse to the length of the side opposite the angle. (直角三角形中一个角的余割是斜边长度与该角对边长度的比值).|The cosecant of 30 degrees is 2. (30度的余割是2).|
The cosecant of angle A is denoted as csc A. (角A的余割表示为csc A).|Synonyms: reciprocal of sine|Antonyms: sine|noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *cosecans*, present participle of *cosecare* "to cut off," from *co-* "together" + *secare* "to cut."  The term likely arose from considering how the secant and cosecant lines "cut off" the tangent line to a circle.
