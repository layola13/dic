nonunity:/nɒnˈjuːnɪti/ |adj.| 非单位; 非统一性 |Lack of unity; not equal to one.| The nonunity feedback gain can lead to instability in the system. 非单位反馈增益会导致系统不稳定。| The experiment demonstrated the nonunity of the sample.  实验表明了样本的非统一性。| 近义词: disunity, division, incoherence | 反义词: unity, coherence, oneness | 词性: 形容词

词源:  "non-" (prefix meaning "not") + "unity" (noun meaning "the state of being one; oneness").  由表示“不”的前缀“non-”和表示“统一性”的名词“unity”组合而成。
