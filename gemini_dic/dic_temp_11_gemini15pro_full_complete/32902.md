词源:  The name "Chongqing" (重庆) literally translates to "double celebration" or "repeated joy".  It was given this name in 1189 when the future Emperor Guangzong celebrated twice in one year – first his appointment as Prince of Gong, and then his father's ascension to the throne.  The older spelling "Chungking" is based on the Wade-Giles romanization system, while "Chongqing" uses Pinyin.
