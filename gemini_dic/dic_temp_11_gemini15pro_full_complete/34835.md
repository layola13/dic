词源：
"clingingnesses" comes from "cling" + "y" + "-ness".  "Cling" originates from Old English "clingan," meaning "to stick, adhere."  The suffix "-y" turns it into the adjective "clingy," meaning "inclined to cling." Finally, the suffix "-ness" transforms it into the noun "clingingnesses," representing the state or quality of being clingy.
