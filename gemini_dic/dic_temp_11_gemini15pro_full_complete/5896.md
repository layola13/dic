ETYMOLOGY->
From Latin *ambidexter "having two right hands" (from ambi- "both" + dexter "right, skillful"), from Proto-Italic *ambidexteros, from Proto-Indo-European *ambhi- "around" + *deks- "right; south".  The figurative sense of "double-dealing" arose from the notion that such a person could work on both sides.
