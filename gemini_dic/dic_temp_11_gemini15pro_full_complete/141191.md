oomiac:  This word does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It's likely a misspelling, a neologism, or a technical term specific to a very narrow field.  Therefore, it's impossible to provide a standard linguistic analysis.  If you have more context about where you encountered this word, I might be able to offer more specific guidance.

Since I cannot analyze "oomiac," I will demonstrate the requested format with the word "axiom":

axiom: /ˈæksiəm/ | n. | 公理；格言；自明之理 | A statement or proposition which is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. | Example:  It is a widely held axiom that governments should not negotiate with terrorists.  政府不应该与恐怖分子谈判，这是一个被广泛接受的公理。

Example:  One of the key axioms of the theory of relativity is that the speed of light is constant. 相对论的一个关键公理是光速恒定。 | Synonym:  principle, maxim, truism, postulate | Antonym:  paradox, absurdity | Noun
