词源：From Middle English *burne, *borne, from Old English burna (“stream, brook, fountain, spring, well”), from Proto-Germanic *brunnō (“spring, well, source”). Cognate with West Frisian boarne (“spring”), Dutch born (“well, spring”), German Brunnen (“well, fountain”). More distantly related to Latin fons (“fountain, spring”).  The meaning "destination, realm of experience" arose from a metaphorical extension of the "stream" sense, influenced by the archaic past participle form of "bear" (meaning "carry").
