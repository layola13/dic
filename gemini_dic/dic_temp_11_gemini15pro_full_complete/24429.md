ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *bristelen, frequentative of brisen (“to break, burst”), from Old English *brysan (“to break, bruise, crush”), from Proto-Germanic *brustaną (“to burst, break”), from Proto-Indo-European *bʰrews- (“to swell, sprout”).  Cognate with Dutch brisselen (“to crackle, rustle”), German bersten (“to burst”). The sense development is from the image of short, stiff hairs standing up like broken pieces.
