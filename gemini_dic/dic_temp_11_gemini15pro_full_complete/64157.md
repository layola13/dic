ETYMOLOGY->
From late Middle English *equalis(en)*  "make equal," from Latin *aequalizare*, from *aequalis* "equal," from *aequus* "level, even, equal." The "-ize" suffix is a common verb-forming suffix in English, often borrowed from French *-iser* or directly from Latin *-izare*.  The "-ing" suffix transforms the verb into a present participle or gerund.
