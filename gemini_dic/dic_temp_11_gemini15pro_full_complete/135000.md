Etymology:
From non- + nebulous + -ness.  Non- is a prefix meaning "not." Nebulous comes from the Latin word "nebula," meaning "cloud" or "mist." The suffix -ness forms nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality. Thus, nonnebulousness literally means "the state of not being cloudy or misty," figuratively extending to clarity and explicitness.
