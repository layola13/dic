USAGE->

"Him's" is considered nonstandard English and grammatically incorrect. The correct possessive form is "his."  It arises from overgeneralizing the possessive 's, which is typically used with nouns (e.g., "the dog's bone").  Avoid using "him's" in formal writing and speech.  While it might be heard in some dialects or casual conversation, it's generally perceived as uneducated.
