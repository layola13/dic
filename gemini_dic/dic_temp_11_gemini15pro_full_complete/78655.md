词源:
From Middle English gidi, gydi (“foolish, mad, possessed by a god”), from Old English gīdig (“insane, possessed by a god”), from Proto-Germanic *gōdīgą (“possessed by a god”), from Proto-Indo-European *ǵʰu̯et- (“to invoke, implore”). Cognate with Old Norse geðigr (“insane”).  More literally, "god-possessed," from the same root as god.  The sense of "dizzy" developed later.
