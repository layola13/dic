词源:  Likely a back-formation from the verb "colluctate," meaning "to struggle with," which itself is derived from the Latin "colluctari," meaning "to wrestle, struggle."  However, "colluctate" is also rare and "colluctancy" even more so.  It's possible this word was formed through a misunderstanding or mishearing of "reluctance."
