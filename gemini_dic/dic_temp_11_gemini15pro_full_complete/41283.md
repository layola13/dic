ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *cordiālis "of or for the heart," from Latin cord- "heart."  The original sense in English was "invigorating or reviving the heart," hence "cheering, stimulating." The sense of "hearty, sincere" developed from this.  The noun meaning "liqueur" arose from the use of such drinks as restoratives.
