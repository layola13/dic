monatomic:/ˌmɒnəˈtɒmɪk/ /ˌmɑːnəˈtɑːmɪk/| adj.|单原子的|Consisting of single atoms, not combined with others to form molecules.|Helium is a monatomic gas. 氦是单原子气体。|近义词:monoatomic|反义词:polyatomic|词性:形容词

Etymology->
From mono- (one) + atomic.  "Mono-" comes from the Greek "monos" (μόνος), meaning "alone," "single," or "solitary." "Atomic" derives from the Greek word "atomos" (ἄτομος), meaning "indivisible" or "uncuttable," reflecting the ancient belief that atoms were the smallest possible units of matter.
