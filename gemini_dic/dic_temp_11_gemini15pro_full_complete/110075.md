lichenization:/ˌlaɪkənɪˈzeɪʃən/ | n. |地衣化，地衣共生| The symbiotic association of a fungus and an alga to form a lichen.  The process by which a surface becomes covered with lichens. | Example 1: Lichenization of the rocks indicated the clean air quality of the region.  岩石的地衣化表明该地区空气质量良好。

Example 2: The degree of lichenization can be used to estimate the age of the rock surface. 地衣化的程度可以用来估计岩石表面的年龄。| 近义词: symbiosis,  lichen growth | 反义词:  (No direct antonym, possibly lichen death or removal) | 词性: noun


lichenized:/ˈlaɪkənaɪzd/ | adj. | 地衣化的 | Covered with lichens; having undergone lichenization. | Example 1: The lichenized rocks provided a habitat for various insects. 地衣化的岩石为各种昆虫提供了栖息地。

Example 2:  The researchers studied the lichenized bark of old-growth trees. 研究人员研究了老龄树木的地衣化的树皮。 | 近义词: moss-covered,  lichen-encrusted | 反义词: bare,  uncolonized | 词性: adjective


词源: From lichen + -ization. Lichen comes from Greek *leikhēn* meaning "to lick," referring to the way some lichens appear to adhere to surfaces.
