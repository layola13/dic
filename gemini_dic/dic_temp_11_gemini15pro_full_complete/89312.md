homogangliate:/ˌhoʊmoʊˈɡæŋɡliɪt/
adjective
同神经节的
Having or characterized by ganglia of similar form or structure.
The nervous system of the earthworm is homogangliate, meaning its ganglia are similar in structure along the length of its body. 蚯蚓的神经系统是同神经节的，这意味着它的神经节沿着身体的长度结构相似。
The homogangliate structure allows for coordinated movement along the body.  同神经节的结构允许沿着身体进行协调运动。
Synonym: isoganglionic
Antonym: heterogangliate
词性: adjective

Etymology:
