dissipativities:/ˌdɪsɪˈpeɪtɪvɪtiz/ | n. | 耗散性，消散性 | The property of a system that leads to the dissipation or scattering of energy, often as heat.  It is a plural form of "dissipativity".  In physics and engineering, it refers to the inherent tendency of dynamic systems to lose energy over time due to factors like friction, resistance, or radiation. | The analysis of the system's dissipativities revealed significant energy losses. 系统耗散性的分析揭示了显著的能量损失。|  Near synonyms: damping, attenuation, losses | Near antonyms: amplification, gain | noun
