注意事项:

* "Amar" is not a standard English word.  It is likely borrowed from another language, possibly Spanish, Portuguese, or Italian, where it translates to "to love."  While understandable in context, using "amar" in English might sound unusual or archaic.  "Love" is the more common and appropriate word in most situations.
* This detailed breakdown assumes that "amar" is being used as a verb meaning "to love."  If it is intended as a different part of speech or has a different meaning, the analysis would need to be adjusted accordingly.
