词源: "Chibo" is likely a loanword from Japanese, where "cibo" ( cibo) refers to food or provisions.  However, the specific usage to denote a small snack, especially a fried one, might be a regional or even more recent development, and its exact etymology is difficult to confirm without further context. It's possible this word is slang, regional dialect, or even a recently coined term.
