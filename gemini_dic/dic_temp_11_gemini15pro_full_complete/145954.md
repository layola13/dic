overdispersion:/ˌoʊvər dɪˈspɜːrʒən/ | n. | 过度离散 |  In statistics, overdispersion is the presence of greater variability (statistical dispersion) in a data set than would be expected based on a given statistical model.  It means the variance of the data is higher than predicted by the model. | The researchers observed overdispersion in the data, suggesting the Poisson model was not appropriate. 研究人员观察到数据中存在过度离散，表明泊松模型不适用。

Overdispersion was evident in the number of accidents per month. 每月事故数量明显存在过度离散。 | 近义词: extra-Poisson variation, heterogeneity | 反义词: underdispersion | 词性: noun
