词源：disconnect + -ed + -ness + -es (plural)

"disconnect" comes from the Latin "dis-" (apart, asunder) + "connectere" (to bind together).  "-ed" forms the past participle and adjective. "-ness" turns the adjective into a noun denoting a state or quality.  "-es" creates the plural form, indicating multiple instances of this state.
