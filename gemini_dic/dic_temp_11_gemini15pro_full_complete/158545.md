##plesiomorphous 的详细解析pliːziəˈmɔːrfəs/ | adj. |祖征的；原始特征的 |  Referring to a characteristic that is present in the ancestor of a group.  A plesiomorphy is aprimitive character.  It is a trait that is inherited from a distant ancestor and is therefore shared by many related groups.  It’s important to distinguish plesiomorphies from apomorphies (derived characteristics). |  The presence of five fingers is a plesiomorphous trait in mammals.  | 近义词：ancestral, primitive | 反义词：apomorphic,derived(μορφή):** meaning "form" or "shape"iomorphous is primarily used in cladistics (phylogenetic systematics) and evolutionary biology. It is a crucial concept when constructing phylogenetic trees and understanding the evolutionary relationships among organisms.  A plesiomorphy, while shared by members of a group, does not necessarily indicate a close relationship *within* that group. The characteristic could have been inherited from a very distant common ancestor.and a human in terms of their closest relatives.  Other, more recently evolved characteristics are needed to resolve finer evolutionary relationships. The analysis requires distinguishing primitive (plesiomorphous) characteristics from derived (apomorphic) ones to build an accurate evolutionary tree.plesiomorphous characteristic found in many reptile groups, but it doesn't tell us much about the relationships between different reptile species.  (鳞片是许多爬行动物群体中的一种祖征，但这并不能告诉我们关于不同爬行动物物种之间关系的太多信息。)and birds possess a four-chambered heart, this is an example of convergent evolution, not a shared derived characteristic.  Both inherited that feature separately from different ancestors than a four-chambered heart would be shown to be a plesiomorphy for the entire group. (虽然鳄鱼和鸟类都拥有四腔心，但这却是趋同进化的例子，而不是共享的衍生特征。事实上，这可能表明四腔心是这整个组的祖传特征。)lesiomorphy:** An ancestral character inherited from a distant ancestor. Shared by many taxa (groups of organisms).  Does not necessarily indicate close relatedness within the group.de).  Used to define monophyletic groups (groups that include a common ancestor and all of its descendants).baseline, indicating traits inherited from earlier ancestors which are common, but not definitively helpful to clarify recent evolutionary divergences within a group.
