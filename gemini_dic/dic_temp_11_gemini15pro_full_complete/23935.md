词性

Etymology:
From Old English *brēamian (unattested), from brēam "bright, glorious, famous," from Proto-Germanic *brōmijaz.  Cognate with Old High German brāmi "famous" and Old Norse brjámi "fire." The original sense was "to be radiant, shine brightly," later "to glow with emotion, be exuberant."  The modern sense of "to be full to the brim" developed from the idea of overflowing with emotion or energy.
