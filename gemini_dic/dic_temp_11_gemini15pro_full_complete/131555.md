ETYMOLOGY->
From non- + commodious + -ness + -es.  "Commodious" comes from the Late Latin "commodiosus," meaning "advantageous, suitable," from "commodus" ("convenient, proper").  The prefix "non-" negates the meaning, and the suffix "-ness" forms a noun indicating a state or quality.  The final "-es" marks the plural form.
