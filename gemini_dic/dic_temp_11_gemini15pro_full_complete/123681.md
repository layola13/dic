词源:
From Old English *mōd (unattested), from Proto-Germanic *mōdaz ("mood, mind, spirit, courage"), from Proto-Indo-European *meh₂- ("to measure, limit"). Cognate with Old Saxon mōd ("mind, mood, courage, arrogance"), Old Frisian mōd ("mind, mood, courage, pride"), Dutch moed ("courage"), Old High German muot ("mind, mood, spirit, courage"), German Mut ("courage"), Old Norse móðr ("wrath, anger"), Gothic 𐌼𐍉𐌸𐍃 (moþs, "anger, wrath").  The sense shifted from "heart, spirit" to "temporary state of mind" in Middle English.
