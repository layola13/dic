flowability:/ˌfloʊəˈbɪləti/| n.|流动性，流易性|The flowability of the powder is crucial for the manufacturing process.  这种粉末的流动性对生产过程至关重要。|The concrete mix had good flowability, making it easy to pour.  这种混凝土混合物的流动性很好，很容易浇筑。|近义词：fluidity, pourability|反义词：viscosity, stickiness|词性:noun

Etymology:
From flow + -able + -ity.  Flow (from Old English *flōwan) meaning "to glide along," related to float.  -able (from Latin -abilis) forms adjectives meaning "capable of being." -ity (from French -ité, from Latin -itas) forms nouns of quality or condition.
