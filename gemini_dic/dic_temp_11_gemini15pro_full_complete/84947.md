注意事项:  已按要求完成所有内容。  "Hap" is an archaic word, and its verb form is rarely used in modern English.  The noun form is more common, but still less frequent than synonyms like "chance," "fortune," or "accident."  Therefore, some of the tense examples, especially the continuous tenses, feel somewhat unnatural because they are not typical usages of the word.
