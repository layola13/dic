PHRASE->

(Overgracious doesn't typically form set phrases.  It's more often used descriptively.)

词源:  "Over-" (excessive) + "gracious" (courteous, kind). The prefix "over-" indicates an excess or surpassing of the usual degree.  "Gracious" comes from the Old French "gracios," ultimately from the Latin "gratia" (grace, favor).
