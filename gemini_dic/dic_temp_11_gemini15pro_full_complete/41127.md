Etymology:
"co-" (prefix): together, jointly (from Latin "com-")
"prosper": to thrive, flourish, be successful (from Latin "prosperare")
"-itirs":  This appears to be a non-standard or invented suffix, likely intended to create a plural noun form analogous to words like "partners" or "collaborators". While grammatically unconventional, it conveys the intended meaning within the context of the word.
