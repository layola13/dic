illustration (noun): from Late Latin illustratio, from Latin illustrare "light up, illuminate, make clear," figuratively "make illustrious, famous," from assimilated form of in- "in, into" (from PIE root *en "in") + lustrare "make bright," from lustrum "purification, expiatory offering," perhaps from luere "to purify, atone for."
