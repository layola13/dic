ETYMOLOGY->
From French *cavalier*, "horseman, knight," from Late Latin *caballarius*, "horseman," from Latin *caballus*, "horse." The sense of "disdainful" arose from the perceived arrogance of aristocratic horsemen.  The suffix "-ness" transforms the adjective "cavalier" into the abstract noun "cavalierness," denoting the quality or state of being cavalier.
