oracus: /ɔːˈreɪkəs/ | n. | 神谕，预言 |  A divine communication or revelation, often ambiguous or obscure. It can also refer to the place where such revelations are received or the person or medium through which they are delivered.  Derived from Latin "oraculum." While not a standard English word, it appears to be a constructed term based on Latin roots, likely intended to evoke a sense of ancient prophecy or mystical knowledge. | The sibyl delivered her oracus from the depths of the cave. 西比尔从洞穴深处传达了她的神谕。| The oracus foretold a time of great upheaval. 神谕预言了一个动荡不安的时代。 | synonym: prophecy, prediction, oracle | antonym:  - | noun
