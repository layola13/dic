Therefore, it literally translates to "parallel-plane-ed," reflecting its geometrical properties of having parallel faces.  The suffix "-iped" is common in geometry terms signifying a solid figure., geometry, crystallography, and related fields. It’s a precise term defining a specific three-dimensional shape.  It's not a word frequently used in everyday conversation.they can be further categorized based on their properties:**  The edges connecting opposite faces are perpendicular, resulting in rectangular faces.  Note that a rectangular parallelepiped is a specific case of a right parallelepiped.are not rectangles.晶体结构最恰当的描述是一个**平行六面体**。term.comprehensive and cover various tenses and grammatical structures.
