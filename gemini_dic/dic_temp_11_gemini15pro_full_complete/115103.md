manganite:/ˈmæŋɡənaɪt/ | n. |锰矿; 水锰矿 |A mineral consisting of hydrous manganese oxide, MnO(OH), occurring as black prismatic crystals or masses.|Manganite is often found in association with other manganese minerals. 水锰矿经常与其他锰矿物伴生。| Synonyms:  pyrolusite, psilomelane | Antonyms: None | Noun

ETYMOLOGY->
From *manganese* + *-ite* (suffix forming names of minerals).  Manganese ultimately derives from Latin *magnes* (magnet) due to the confusion between two black minerals, pyrolusite (manganese dioxide) and magnetite (magnetic iron oxide).
