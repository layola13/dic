ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle French *cifre*, from Medieval Latin *cifra*, from Arabic *صِفْر* (*ṣifr*, “zero, empty”), from *صَفَرَ* (*ṣafara*, “to be empty”).  The sense development from "zero" to "cipher" arose from the use of Arabic numerals, where zero was a novel concept.  This then broadened to mean any numeral and eventually to secret writing.
