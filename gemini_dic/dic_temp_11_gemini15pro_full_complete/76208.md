Etymology (词源):

From Middle English *fusti, from Old French fusté "tasting of the cask," from fust "cask, wine cask," from Late Latin fustis "cudgel, club; tree trunk," from Latin fustis "staff, club." The semantic development likely progressed from "tasting of the cask" to "stale" and then to "old-fashioned."
