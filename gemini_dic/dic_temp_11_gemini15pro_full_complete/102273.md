PHRASE->
(Not applicable for suffixes. Phrases are formed with words, not suffixes.)

注意事项:
The suffix "-itive" is derived from Latin. It often signifies "tending to" or "serving to".  It doesn't function as an independent word. It's always attached to a root word to create an adjective.  Examples: sensitive, competitive, acquisitive.
