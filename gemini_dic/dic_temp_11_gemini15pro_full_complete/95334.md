Etymology:
From Old French encensement, from encenser "to burn incense, kindle," from en- "in" + censer "to burn incense," from Latin incensum "something burned," past participle of incendere "to set on fire, kindle," from in- "in, on" + candere "to shine, glow."  The meaning "state of being incensed (angered)" arose from the notion of "inflaming" someone's passions.
