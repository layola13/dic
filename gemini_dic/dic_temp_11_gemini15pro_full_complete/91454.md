hygroscopic:/ˌhaɪɡrəˈskɒpɪk/ | adj. | 吸湿的；吸水的 | Readily absorbing moisture from the air. |  Example 1: Table salt is hygroscopic and will clump together if left exposed to humid air. 食盐具有吸湿性，如果暴露在潮湿的空气中会结块。

Example 2: Hygroscopic materials are used in desiccators to keep other substances dry. 吸湿性材料用于干燥器中以保持其他物质干燥。 | 近义词: absorbent, moisture-absorbing | 反义词: waterproof, water-repellent | 词性: adjective

Etymology: From Greek *hygros* (wet, moist) + *-skopikos* (observing, examining).  "Hygro-" relates to moisture, and "-scopic" relates to observing or tending towards.
