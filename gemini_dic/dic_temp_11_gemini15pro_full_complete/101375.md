ionospheres:/aɪˈɒnəsfɪəz/ | n. | 电离层 | The region of the earth's atmosphere containing a high concentration of ions and free electrons and extending from about 50 to 600 miles (80 to 1,000 km) above the earth's surface.  It is capable of reflecting radio waves. |  Shortwave radio signals can bounce off the ionosphere and travel long distances. 短波无线电信号可以从电离层反射并传播很长的距离。 |  synonyms: thermosphere (although not perfectly synonymous, as the thermosphere encompasses a larger region), upper atmosphere | antonyms:  (No direct antonym, as it is a specific atmospheric layer. One could perhaps consider "lower atmosphere" as a contrasting concept.) | noun
