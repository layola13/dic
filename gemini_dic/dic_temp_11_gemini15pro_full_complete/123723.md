词源:  This word originated in Wiltshire, England.  A folk tale tells of villagers trying to rake the reflection of the moon from a pond, believing it to be a round cheese.  This led to the term being used for simple-minded people and later smugglers who would attempt to retrieve contraband thrown in ponds.
