ETYMOLOGY->
From over- + fastidious + -ness.  "Over-" is a prefix meaning "excessively" or "too much." "Fastidious" comes from the Latin "fastidium," meaning "loathing" or "disgust," later evolving to mean "squeamish" and then "excessively particular."  "-ness" is a suffix used to form nouns from adjectives, indicating a state or quality.
