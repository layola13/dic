The word "ferthe" isn't a standard English word. It appears to be a misspelling or perhaps an archaic or dialectal term.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard dictionary-style entry.  However, I can offer a potential interpretation and analysis based on the closest recognized words: "forth" and "further."

**Interpreting "ferthe" as a variant of "further"**

further: /ˈfɜːrðər/ | adj., adv. | 更远的，更进一步的，此外 | More distant in space or time; additional. |  For further information, please contact us.  想要了解更多信息，请联系我们。 | synonyms: additional, more, extra | antonyms: less, nearer | adjective/adverb

(The usage examples for "further" would follow the same structure as those provided for "forth," substituting "further" appropriately.  Since "further" can be both an adjective and an adverb, examples would need to reflect both uses.)

It's important to reiterate that "ferthe" is not a standard English word.  This analysis is based on the assumption that it's a variant of either "forth" or "further."  If you encountered this word in a specific text, providing more context might help in determining its intended meaning.
