##oxyphenolˌɑːksiˈfiːnɒl/ | n. |羟基苯酚 |  Oxyphenol refers to a group of organic compounds containing both a hydroxyl (-OH) group and a phenol group (-C₆H₅OH) attached to a benzene ring.  They are derivatives of phenol where one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by a hydroxyl group. Oxyphenols exhibit diverse chemicalproperties and biological activities depending on the number and position of the hydroxyl groups. They are found in various natural products and are also synthesized for industrial applications.  The most well-known oxyphenol is bisphenol A (BPA), a widely usedindustrial chemical with potential endocrine-disrupting effects. Other examples include hydroquinone and catechol. |  Many oxyphenols, like bisphenol A (BPA), are used in the production of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins.  These arecommonly found in food packaging and consumer products. | 近义词: dihydroxybenzene (depending on the specific structure) | 反义词:  This is difficult to define as it depends on the context and its relation to other compounds.
