现在完成进行时 (Present Perfect Continuous):
The program has been going to that specific subroutine repeatedly. 程序一直在重复地跳转到那个特定的子例程。
The debugger has been showing that the execution has been going to the wrong function.  调试器一直显示执行过程一直在跳转到错误的函数。

一般过去时 (Simple Past):
The program went to the designated line without any issues. 程序顺利跳转到指定行。
The code went to the wrong label, causing the program to crash. 代码跳转到了错误的标签，导致程序崩溃。

过去进行时 (Past Continuous):
The program was going to the next function when the error occurred.  发生错误时，程序正在跳转到下一个函数。
The debugger was showing where the control flow was going to. 调试器正在显示控制流将跳转到哪里。

过去完成时 (Past Perfect):
The program had gone to the error handling routine before the crash. 在崩溃之前，程序已经跳转到错误处理例程。
The code had gone to the wrong subroutine, which caused the unexpected output.  代码跳转到了错误的子例程，这导致了意外的输出。

过去完成进行时 (Past Perfect Continuous):
The program had been going to that section of code for some time before the error manifested.  在错误显现之前，程序已经有一段时间一直在跳转到那段代码。
The debugger had been showing that the execution had been going to an infinite loop. 调试器一直显示执行过程一直在进入一个无限循环。


一般将来时 (Simple Future):
The program will go to the specified line after completing this loop.  完成此循环后，程序将跳转到指定行。
If the condition is met, the code will go to the next function.  如果满足条件，代码将跳转到下一个函数。

将来进行时 (Future Continuous):
The program will be going to the next subroutine at that point. 届时，程序将跳转到下一个子例程。
The debugger will be showing where the execution will be going to next. 调试器将显示执行过程接下来将跳转到哪里。

将来完成时 (Future Perfect):
By the end of this process, the program will have gone to that function multiple times. 到此过程结束时，程序将已经多次跳转到该函数。
The control flow will have gone through several branches by then. 到那时，控制流将已经通过多个分支。

将来完成进行时 (Future Perfect Continuous):
The program will have been going to that subroutine repeatedly for several minutes by the time the error is detected.  到检测到错误时，程序将已经重复跳转到该子例程几分钟了。
By then, the execution will have been going to the wrong part of the code for a considerable amount of time. 到那时，执行过程将已经相当长一段时间跳转到代码的错误部分了。
