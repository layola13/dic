Etymology:
From deform + -ly. Deform comes from the Old French *deformer* and ultimately from the Latin *deformare*, meaning "to disfigure, put out of shape," from *de-* "from, away" + *formare* "to shape."  The suffix *-ly* is a common adverbial ending in English, derived from Old English *-lice*.
