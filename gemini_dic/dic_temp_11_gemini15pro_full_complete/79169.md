词源:
From the verb "glamorize," which comes from "glamour" (meaning magic, enchantment) + "-ize" (a suffix that turns nouns into verbs meaning "to make or become").  "Glamour" ultimately derives from the Scottish word "gramarye," meaning magic, which is related to the word "grammar."  The association arose because learning was once considered a form of magic.  "-er" is a suffix denoting a person who performs an action.
