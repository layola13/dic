Etymology: From "absolute" + "-ness"

"Absolute" comes from Late Latin *absolūtus*, past participle of *absolvĕre* "to absolve, set free, finish," from *ab* "off, away from" + *solvĕre* "to loosen, release."  "-ness" is a native English suffix forming nouns from adjectives, expressing state, quality, or condition.
