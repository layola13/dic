Etymology:
From "over" (Old English *ofer) + "merciful" (from "mercy" (Old French merci) + "-ful" (Old English -full)) + "-ness" (Old English -nes).  "Over-" signifies "excessive" or "too much."  "Merciful" stems from "mercy," ultimately derived from Latin "merces" meaning "reward, price, wages." The suffix "-ness" forms nouns denoting a state or quality.
