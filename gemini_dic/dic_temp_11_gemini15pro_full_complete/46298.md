d-glucose:/ˈdiː ˈɡluːkoʊs/ /ˈdiː ˈɡluːkəʊs/| n. |右旋葡萄糖|A simple sugar (monosaccharide) and an important carbohydrate in biology.  It is an aldohexose and is also known as dextrose. D-glucose is the most abundant monosaccharide, a subcategory of carbohydrates. D-glucose is mainly made by plants and most algae during photosynthesis from water and carbon dioxide, using energy from sunlight, where it is used to make cellulose in cell walls, the most abundant carbohydrate.|D-glucose is the primary source of energy for living organisms. 右旋葡萄糖是生物体主要的能量来源。|Glucose, dextrose|Fructose (fruit sugar)|noun
