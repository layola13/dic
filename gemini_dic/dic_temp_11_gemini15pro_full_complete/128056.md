The word "nerre" does not exist in standard English dictionaries. It's possible that it's a misspelling, a regional dialect word, a slang term, or a newly coined word.  Please double-check the spelling.  If you can provide more context (where you encountered this word, what you think it might mean), I might be able to offer a better answer.


Since I can't analyze "nerre", I'll demonstrate the requested format with the word "axiom":

axiom: /ˈæksiəm/ | n. | 公理；格言；自明之理 | A statement or proposition that is regarded as being established, accepted, or self-evidently true. | Example:  The axiom that supply and demand determine prices. 供求关系决定价格的公理。 | Example:  It is a widely held axiom that governments should not negotiate with terrorists. 政府不应该与恐怖分子谈判是一个被广泛接受的公理。 | Synonym:  principle, theorem, law, rule | Antonym:  paradox, absurdity | Noun
