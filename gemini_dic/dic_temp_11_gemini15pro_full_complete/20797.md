ETYMOLOGY->

The word "blarney" comes from Blarney Castle, near Cork, Ireland.  There is a stone there, the Blarney Stone, which is said to give the gift of eloquence (or "the gift of gab") to those who kiss it.  Over time, "blarney" came to refer to the kind of persuasive, flattering talk associated with getting people to kiss the stone, and "blarneyer" refers to someone who engages in such talk.
