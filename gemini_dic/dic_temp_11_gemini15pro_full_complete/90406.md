PHRASE->
(Howso is not typically used in phrases. It is a standalone adverb.  It's more common in older or more formal styles of English. Modern equivalents are generally preferred.)
Instead of using "howso" in phrases, you'd likely use "how":

How about this? = 这个怎么样？
How come? = 为什么？ 怎么会这样？
How is it going? =  进展如何？
How's that? = 怎么样？(用于确认对方是否听到或理解)
How so? =  怎么会这样？(询问原因或解释) (This is the closest phrase and is a separate word, not a contraction of howso.)


注意事项:

Howso is considered archaic or dialectal in modern English and is rarely used.  "How" is the preferred and more common word in contemporary usage.
