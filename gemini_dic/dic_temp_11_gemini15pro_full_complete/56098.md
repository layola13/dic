词源:  From doctor (n.) + -ed.  Ultimately from Latin doctor "teacher," from docere "to teach."  The meaning shifted from "learned man" to "physician" in the Middle Ages. The verb sense of "to tamper with" arose in the 19th century, likely from the idea of altering something to improve its appearance or function, as a doctor might do.
