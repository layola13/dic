monotrophic:/ˌmɒnəˈtrɒfɪk/ | adj. | 单食性的，单养性的 | Obtaining nourishment from only one kind of food or host.  Relating to or characterized by dependence on a single source of energy or nutrition. |  Example 1: The fungus is monotrophic, meaning it derives its nutrients from a specific tree species. 这种真菌是单食性的，意味着它从特定树种中获取营养。

Example 2: Monotrophic plants lack chlorophyll and rely entirely on mycorrhizal fungi for their carbon. 单食性植物缺乏叶绿素，完全依赖菌根真菌获取碳。 | Near synonyms:  specialized, monophagous | Antonyms:  polyphagous, omnivorous | Word type: Adjective
