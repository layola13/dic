ETYMOLOGY->
fire (n.) + proof (n.)

"fire" comes from Old English "fyr," meaning "fire, flame."

"proof" comes from Old French "prove," meaning "evidence, test," ultimately from Latin "probare," meaning "to test, to prove."

The combination "fireproof" literally means "tested by fire" or "resistant to the effects of fire."
