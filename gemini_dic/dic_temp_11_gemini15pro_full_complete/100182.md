词源:
From inter- + relate.  "Inter-" is a prefix meaning "between," "among," or "reciprocally." "Relate" comes from the Latin "relatus," the past participle of "referre," meaning "to carry back" or "to bring back." Thus, "interrelate" literally means to "bring back between" or "connect reciprocally."
