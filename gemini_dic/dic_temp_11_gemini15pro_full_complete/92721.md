ETYMOLOGY->
From New Latin *Ichneumonidae, from Ichneumon (a genus of these wasps) + -idae (a taxonomic suffix denoting a family). Ichneumon comes from Ancient Greek ἰχνεύμων (ikhneúmōn, “tracker”), from ἰχνεύω (ikhneuō, “I track, trace”), from ἴχνος (íkhnos, “track, footprint”).  The name refers to the wasp's habit of searching for its host.
