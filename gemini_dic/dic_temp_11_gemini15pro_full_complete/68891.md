词源:  "fast forward" originated as a verb phrase, combining the adverb "fast" (meaning quickly) with the verb "forward" (meaning to move ahead).  It initially referred to the function on tape recorders and VCRs that allowed users to quickly advance the tape. The phrase later became a noun to describe the button or function itself, and also gained a metaphorical meaning of quickly advancing through time or a process.
