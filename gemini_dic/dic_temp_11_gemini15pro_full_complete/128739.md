注意事项:

This word is considered offensive and should be avoided.  Its etymology is linked to a racial slur, and even though it originally meant "stingy" or "miserly," its use is unacceptable in modern English.  Using synonyms like "stingy," "miserly," "parsimonious," or "penurious" is strongly recommended.  This explanation includes the word only for etymological and historical context.
