注意事项:

*dehorter* is a relatively uncommon word, even in French.  While its literal meaning is "to evict" or "to expel," it carries a stronger connotation of forced removal, often related to undesirable or illegal activities.  It is not typically used for everyday evictions related to rent or property disputes.
