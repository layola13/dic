词源：From hunch (n.) + -ed. The verb is from 1859, from the noun meaning "lump, protuberance," also "a strong, intuitive feeling" (1821), of uncertain origin.  Perhaps related to Middle Dutch hunk "lump, piece," or to Old English huncettan "to limp."  The figurative sense of "intuitive feeling" is from 1908.
