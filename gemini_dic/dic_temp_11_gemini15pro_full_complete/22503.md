The word "boomdas" is not a recognized word in English.  It appears to be a neologism or a misspelling.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.  However, if you meant "boom" followed by "das" (which could be the German definite article, but is unlikely in this context without more information), I can analyze "boom".
