PHRASE->
(Since "Barth" is a proper noun, surname, it doesn't typically have common phrases associated with it.  Phrases would be more context-specific, like "the Barth family history" or "the theological works of Karl Barth.")


注意事项:  As noted, since "Barth" is a surname, many of the grammatical examples are somewhat contrived to illustrate the usage.  In real-world usage, it would most commonly be used as a part of a person's full name (e.g., "John Barth," "Karl Barth").
