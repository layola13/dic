PHRASE->
(It is difficult to make natural-sounding phrases with "neuterings" as it's not typically used in casual conversation in the plural form.)
Low-cost neuterings are available. 提供低价绝育服务。
Free neuterings are offered by the clinic. 诊所提供免费的绝育服务。


注意事项:
* As noted throughout the examples, "neuterings" while grammatically correct as a plural noun, is less commonly used compared to the singular "neutering" or using the verb "to neuter."  It sounds more natural to say "They are performing several neuterings" than "They are neuterings several cats."  It is even more common and natural to use passive voice constructions like "The cats are being neutered."
