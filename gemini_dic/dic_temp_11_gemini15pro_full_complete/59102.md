ETYMOLOGY->
"dying-out" is a compound word formed from the present participle of the verb "die" (meaning "to cease living") and the adverb/preposition "out" (meaning "to completion or extinction").  The combination creates the sense of a process of ceasing to exist. The word "die" has its roots in Old English "dēaþ" and Proto-Germanic "*dawjaną," ultimately from Proto-Indo-European "*dheu-," meaning "to die, disappear, become extinct."
