cambia:/ˈkæmbiə/ (plural of cambium)| n.|形成层（复数）|Multiple layers of cells in a plant that produce new phloem and xylem cells.|The cambia are responsible for the increase in girth of trees.|Synonyms: generative layers, growth layers|Antonyms: N/A|Noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *cambium "exchange, change," from cambiare "to exchange," related to Latin cambire "to barter."  The botanical sense arose from the notion of the cambium "changing" into new wood and bark.
