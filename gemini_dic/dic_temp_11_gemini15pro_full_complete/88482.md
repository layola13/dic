词源：
From Middle French *historique (attested in Old Occitan istoric), from Latin historicus, from Ancient Greek ἱστορικός (historikós, “knowing by inquiry, learned in history”), from ἱστορία (historía, “inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation, account, history”).  The noun use in English is a shortening of historical novel, first recorded 1821.

注意事项:
historical和historic都可以表示“历史的”，但用法有所区别。historic指具有重大历史意义的，而historical指与历史有关的，或基于史实的。
