ETYMOLOGY->
From Late Latin *genialis "of or belonging to marriage, nuptial, productive, pleasant," from Latin genius "guardian deity or spirit which watches over each person from birth; innate ability or inclination," from PIE *gen- "give birth, beget."  The sense evolution is from "festive, pertaining to birth or generation" to "pleasant, kindly."  The noun form "genialness" arises from the adjective "genial" with the suffix "-ness."
