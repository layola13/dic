ETYMOLOGY->

From Middle English *chappen*, from Old English *ceapian* (“to buy, sell, bargain”), of uncertain origin. The sense development is unclear; perhaps originally referring to the splitting or cracking of chapped skin resembling cracks in dried mud or earth, or perhaps from a sense of "to exchange" (skin for a rough, dry state).
