nondegenerate:/ˌnɒndɪˈdʒɛnərət/ | adj. | 非退化的，非简并的 | Not degenerate; having a full set of distinct eigenvalues or eigenvectors (in mathematics); not deteriorated or degraded (in general). |  The matrix is nondegenerate, meaning its determinant is nonzero.  这个矩阵是非退化的，意味着它的行列式不等于零。

The nondegenerate energy levels of the system are well-separated.  系统的非简并能级是良好分离的。 | Near synonyms:  distinct, typical, normal, standard | Antonyms: degenerate, atypical, abnormal, deteriorated | adjective


nondegenerates:/ˌnɒndɪˈdʒɛnərəts/ | n. | 非退化物，非简并物 | Plural form of "nondegenerate," referring to a group of nondegenerate things or entities. | The nondegenerates in the sample showed a clear pattern. 样本中的非退化物显示出清晰的模式。

The scientist focused their study on the nondegenerates of the species. 科学家将他们的研究集中在该物种的非退化物上。 | Near synonyms: normal entities, standard examples, typical specimens | Antonyms: degenerates, atypical entities | noun


Etymology:

"Non-" is a prefix meaning "not."

"Degenerate" comes from the Latin "degenerare," meaning "to decline from its kind, deteriorate," from "de-" (down from) + "genus" (birth, race, kind).
