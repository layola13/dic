nondistributivenesses:/ˌnɑːndɪˌstrɪbjʊˈtɪvnɪsəz/ | n. | 非分配性 | The lack of distributiveness, meaning a property or operation does not distribute over another operation.  This is a complex mathematical concept related to logic and set theory. | The nondistributivenesses of the logical operators caused complications in the proof. 这些逻辑运算符的非分配性给证明带来了复杂性。| The theorem highlights the nondistributivenesses inherent in certain algebraic structures.  该定理突出了某些代数结构中固有的非分配性。 | synonyms: non-distributivity (more common singular form),  | antonyms: distributivity | noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From "non-" (not) + "distributive" (relating to distribution) + "-ness" (forming nouns expressing state or quality) + "-es" (plural suffix). "Distributive" ultimately comes from Latin "distributivus."
