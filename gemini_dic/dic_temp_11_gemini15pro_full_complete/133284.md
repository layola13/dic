nonexpansivenesses:/ˌnɒnɪkˈspæn.sɪv.nəs.ɪz/
noun
非扩张性（复数）
The quality or state of being nonexpansive.  This refers to a mathematical concept, usually applied to functions or mappings, where the distance between the images of two points under the mapping is no greater than the distance between the original points.
The nonexpansivenesses of these functions allow for stable solutions in iterative algorithms.  这些函数的非扩张性允许在迭代算法中获得稳定的解。
Near Synonyms:  non-expansivity,  contractiveness (in some contexts)
