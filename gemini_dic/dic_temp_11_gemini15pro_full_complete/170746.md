##pseudobiological: /ˌsuːdoʊbaɪəˈlɑːdʒɪkəl/ | adj. | 似生物的；伪生物的 |  伪生物学的；貌似生物学的 |" (meaning false or pretended) and "biological" (relating to biology or living organisms).  It describes something that appears to be biological or related toliving organisms but is not genuinely so. This could refer to processes, structures, or systems that mimic biological features but lack the underlying biological mechanisms.  For example, a computer simulation of a biological system would be considered pseudobiological as itimitates biological behavior without being truly alive.  Similarly, artificial constructs designed to mimic aspects of biological life, such as artificial cells or synthetic biology projects that use biological components, could fall under the umbrella of pseudobiological, depending on thecontext and degree of biological authenticity. The term emphasizes the appearance of biological characteristics without the underlying biological reality.impressive, was ultimately considered pseudobiological due to its reliance on non-organic components.  尽管令人印象深刻，但由于依赖于无机成分，人工生态系统最终被认为是伪生物的。in the sense of imitation)"bios" (βίος), meaning "life," and "logos" (λόγος), meaning "study" or "word". Therefore, the word literally means "falsely relating to life" or "falsely relating to the study of life."used primarily in scientific and technical contexts, particularly in fields such as artificial intelligence, computer science, and synthetic biology, where systems are created to imitate biological processes.  It is often used to highlight the distinction between artificial and natural biological systems.  While the term is less common in everyday language, its understanding is essential forresearchers working at the intersection of biology and technology.  The word's usage generally implies a degree of sophistication in the mimicry, distinguishing it from simply "artificial" or "synthetic." It suggests a deliberate attempt to create something resembling a biological system, even if that system doesn't fully possess the complexity or characteristicsof living organisms.
