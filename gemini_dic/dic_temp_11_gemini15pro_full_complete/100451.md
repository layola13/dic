intertubular:/ˌɪntərˈtjuːbjʊlər/ | adj. |小管间的；肾小管间的|Located between tubules, especially referring to the capillaries in the kidney located between the renal tubules.|The intertubular capillaries reabsorb essential substances filtered by the glomerulus. 肾小管周围的毛细血管重新吸收由肾小球过滤出的必需物质。|Example: Intertubular dentin is less mineralized than peritubular dentin. 小管间牙本质的矿化程度低于小管周牙本质。|Synonym: peritubular (often used interchangeably, but peritubular specifically refers to *around* the tubules) |Antonym:  (No direct antonym, perhaps "intratubular" meaning "within the tubules" could be considered contextually opposite)
