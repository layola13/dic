```rmɪti/ | n. |不整合面，假整合 |英文解析：In geology, a paraconformity is a type of unconformity where the strata above and below the unconformity surface are parallel, butthere is a significant time gap represented by the missing strata. Unlike disconformities which show erosion, paraconformities may show little or no evidence of erosion.  The missing time is normally represented by a gap in the fossil record.  Identification can often be challenging as they necessitate detailed geologic mapping and analysis. |例句：The geologists identified a paraconformity between the Devonian and Carboniferous strata. 地质学家在泥盆纪和石炭纪地层之间发现了一个不整合面。The paraconformity was initially difficult to detect due to the lack of obvious erosional features. 由于缺乏明显的侵蚀特征，该不整合面最初很难被发现。|近义词：unconformity (更广泛的术语) |反义词：conformity (整合)noun "conformity."refers to the agreement or correspondence in form or character. In geology, it specifically refers to sedimentary layers that are laid down in a continuous sequence without significant interruptions.geologic record.  Understanding paraconformities is crucial for interpreting the geologic history of a region, including determining the timing of tectonic events,  paleoclimatic changes, and the evolution of life.  Geologists use various techniques to identify paraconformities, including:Examining the sequences of sedimentary layers for any missing intervals.-deposition.conformities,  paraconformities lack prominent erosional features.  The parallel stratification above and below the unconformity can mask the significant temporal gap.  Therefore, meticulous examination and multiple lines of evidence are needed for confirmation.
