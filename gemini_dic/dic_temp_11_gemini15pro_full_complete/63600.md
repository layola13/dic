词源：Old English scip "ship, boat," from Proto-Germanic *skipam (source also of Old Saxon, Old Norse, Old Frisian skip, Middle Dutch schip, Dutch schip, Old High German skif, German Schiff), from PIE root *(s)keip- "to cut, split, separate" (of wood for a boat). The suffix "-ship" originates from Old English -scipe, denoting "state, condition, office, dignity, skill, art".  Therefore, "envoyship" combines "envoy" with "-ship" to indicate the state or office of being an envoy.
