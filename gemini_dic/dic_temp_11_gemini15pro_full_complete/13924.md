The word "auln" isn't a standard English word. It's likely a misspelling or a word from a different language/dialect.  If you meant "awln" (also not a standard word), "all one" or another word, please clarify. I will proceed with the closest possible standard word: **all one**.  Since "all one" is a phrase, some parts of the requested format are not applicable.

all one: /ɔːl wʌn/ | adj. | 全部相同，无关紧要 |  Meaning it makes no difference; it's all the same. | It's all one to me whether we go by train or bus. 我们坐火车还是公共汽车对我来说都一样。 | It's all one to him whether he wins or loses. 他输赢都无所谓。| 近义词: the same, immaterial, indifferent | 反义词: different, matters | phrase
