ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French "contrition" and directly from Latin "contritio," meaning "a rubbing together, a bruise," from "contritus," past participle of "conterere" "to rub together, bruise, grind," from "com-" (together) + "terere" (to rub).  The sense evolution is from "physical crushing" to "crushing of the spirit."
