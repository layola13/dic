注意事项:

"Gotone" is primarily considered slang or informal.  While understood in some regions, using "bathroom," "restroom," "toilet," or "lavatory" is generally preferred in formal settings or when speaking to someone unfamiliar with the slang term.  It might even be considered impolite in some contexts.  Furthermore, its etymology is simply a shortened and slightly altered pronunciation of "go to one" referring to going to the bathroom. It doesn't have a complex etymology like words derived from Latin or Greek.
