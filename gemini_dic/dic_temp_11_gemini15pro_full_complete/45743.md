curvity: /ˈkɜːrvɪti/ | n. | 曲率，弯曲度 | The degree of curvature or the state of being curved.  The curvity of the lens affects the focus. | 例句：The road's curvity made it difficult to drive. 这条路的弯曲度使得难以驾驶。

例句：The artist explored the curvity of the human form in his sculptures.  这位艺术家在他的雕塑中探索了人体的曲线美。 | 近义词：curvature, bend, curve | 反义词：straightness, linearity | 词性: noun

词源: From "curve" + "-ity" (suffix forming abstract nouns denoting state or quality).  Ultimately from Latin "curvus" (bent, curved).
