"daswe" is not a recognized word in English. It's likely a typo or a neologism (newly coined word).  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard dictionary entry for it.  If you meant a different word, please provide it.

However, since you've requested detailed information about word analysis, I will use the word "**what**" as an example to demonstrate the requested format.
