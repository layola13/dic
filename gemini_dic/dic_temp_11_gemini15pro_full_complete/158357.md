##plc 词汇详解/ | n. | 可编程逻辑控制器 | Programmable Logic Controller |  用于工业自动化控制的电子设备**as control of machinery on factory assembly lines.  PLCs are used in many industries, including manufacturing, automotive, food and beverage, and pharmaceuticals. They areruggedized to withstand harsh industrial conditions, such as extreme temperatures, vibration, and electromagnetic interference. PLCs can control a wide range of devices, including sensors, actuators, and motors.  They typically use ladder logic programming, although other programminglanguages are also available.  PLCs have replaced many hardwired relays and timers in industrial control systems thanks to their flexibility and programmability.  They also offer features like data logging, monitoring, and remote access, greatly improving the efficiency andmaintainability of industrial control systems.以监控温度并相应地调整生产过程。源:**their widespread adoption in industrial automation. The development of PLCs was driven by the need for more flexible and programmable control systems that could be easily reconfigured to handle different tasks and processes.**Manufacturing:** Controlling assembly lines, robots, and other automated equipment.The core functionality of a PLC involves:ladder logic, which is a graphical programming language that resembles the diagrams used to represent relay-based control systems.  However, many modern PLCs also support other programming languages, such as structured text and function block diagrams.
