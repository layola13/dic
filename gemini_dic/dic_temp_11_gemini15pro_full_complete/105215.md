Etymology:  "keypad" comes from "key" (referring to a button) and "pad" (a flat surface).  The "-'s" is the possessive suffix, indicating ownership or belonging.  "Key" has Old English origins (cæg, meaning "key"), and "pad" comes from Middle Dutch (padde, meaning "toad," later referring to anything flat and squat).
