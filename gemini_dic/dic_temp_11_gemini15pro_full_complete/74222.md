注意事项:

This word is highly offensive and should be avoided in polite conversation. Its usage is primarily limited to informal settings among close friends or when expressing extreme anger or frustration.  Even then, it's considered vulgar.  Be extremely cautious about using this word, as it can be highly offensive to Portuguese speakers.  There are much less offensive ways to express anger or frustration.
