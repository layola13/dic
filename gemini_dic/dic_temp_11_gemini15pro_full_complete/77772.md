generability:/ˌdʒɛnərəˈbɪləti/
n.|可生成性，可概括性|The generability of the findings to other populations is questionable.  这些发现对其他人群的概括性值得怀疑。|例句：The study questioned the generability of the results. 这项研究对结果的普遍性提出了质疑。|近义词：generalizability, applicability, universality|反义词：specificity, particularity|词性:名词
Etymology: From "generable" + "-ity". "Generable" comes from "generate" (from Latin "generare," meaning "to beget, produce") + "-able".
