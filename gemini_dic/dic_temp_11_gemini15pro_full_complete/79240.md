PHRASE->
N/A  (It's unusual to have set phrases with "glass's" specifically.  Phrases would more likely use "glass" or "glasses.")

注意事项:
Although grammatically correct, "glass's" can sound awkward, especially with longer words.  "The glass's reflection" is more naturally expressed as "the reflection in the glass" or "the glass's reflection." Using "of the glass" is often smoother.  For plurals ending in -s, like "glasses," using "glasses'" (or "of the glasses") is generally preferred to "glass's" in cases where you're referring to multiple glasses.
