ETYMOLOGY->
From Old English "gast" (meaning "spirit, ghost"), with the possessive suffix "-s."  The word "gast" is related to Old High German "geist" (meaning "spirit, ghost") and Old Norse "geisl" (meaning "ray of light").  The concept likely stems from the idea of a spirit as an ethereal or shadowy presence.
