词源:
From Old French *baster (Modern French bâtir "to build"), from Frankish *bastjan, from Proto-Germanic *bastjaną "to sew with bast" (also source of Old High German besten "to patch, mend," German besten), from *bastą "bast" (inner bark of trees, used for tying). The cooking sense is from the notion of "soaking" the meat. The "beat" meaning developed in 19th-century American English slang.
