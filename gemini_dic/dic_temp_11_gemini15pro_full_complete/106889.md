labyrinthodonta:/ˌlæbərɪnθəˈdɒntə/ | n. | 迷齿螈类 | An extinct subclass of  amphibians, characterized by complex tooth structure and often large size, that flourished from the Devonian through the Triassic periods.  They are considered ancestral to modern amphibians and reptiles. | Example: Labyrinthodonta were among the first vertebrates to truly colonize land.  迷齿螈类是最早真正殖民陆地的脊椎动物之一。

Example:  The study of Labyrinthodonta fossils provides valuable insights into the evolution of terrestrial vertebrates. 对迷齿螈类化石的研究为了解陆生脊椎动物的进化提供了宝贵的见解。| 近义词:Stegocephalia (another name for the group, sometimes used interchangeably, though technically Stegocephalia is a broader term) | 反义词: N/A | 词性: noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From Greek *labyrinthos* "labyrinth" + *odont-*  "tooth," referring to the complex, folded enamel structure of their teeth.
