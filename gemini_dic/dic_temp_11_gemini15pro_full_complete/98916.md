PHRASE->

注意事项:  Using "intent's" is grammatically unusual and often a typo for "intentions." It's recommended to use "intentions" instead.  While possessive forms of "intent" are possible (e.g., "the intent of the law"), the use of "intent's" is rare and can sound awkward.  Therefore, the examples above reflect how it might be used, but using "intentions" is generally preferred.
