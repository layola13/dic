ETYMOLOGY->
From Old French *contenance* "bearing, demeanor, appearance," from *contenir* "to contain, hold," from Latin *continere* "to hold together, enclose," from *com-* "together" + *tenere* "to hold." The original sense referred to a person's overall demeanor, later narrowing to facial expression and then to the more abstract sense of "support" or "approval."
