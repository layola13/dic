chiasma: /kaɪˈæzmə/ /kiˈæzmə/ | n. | 交叉, 交错, (遗传学)交叉 | A point at which paired chromosomes remain in contact during the first metaphase of meiosis, and at which crossing over and exchange of genetic material occur between the strands.  |  The chiasma formation between homologous chromosomes during meiosis is crucial for genetic diversity. 在减数分裂过程中，同源染色体之间的交叉形成对于遗传多样性至关重要。

Chiasma can also refer to the crossing of two optic nerves.  视交叉也指两条视神经的交叉。 | 近义词: crossing, intersection, decussation | 反义词:  N/A | 词性: noun

Etymology: From Late Latin *chiasma, from Greek khiasma "two lines crossed," from khiazein "to mark with a chi," from khi, the name of the 22nd letter of the Greek alphabet (X).
