ETYMOLOGY->
From Middle English *foxesglove, *foxesglofe, from fox + glove.  The "glove" part likely refers to the shape of the flowers, which resemble the fingers of a glove. The "fox" part is of uncertain origin.  Folklore suggests various connections, including foxes using the flowers to silently pad their paws when hunting, or a belief that fairies gave the flowers to foxes to wear as gloves.  The connection to foxes may be entirely fanciful.
