词源:  "Bowgrace" is a relatively modern word, likely a combination of "bow" (from Old English *būgan, meaning "to bend") and "grace" (from Old French grace, meaning "favor, thanks, virtue").  It describes a bow performed with grace and elegance.  While not a common word, it is understandable and evocative.
