ascidiozooid:/əˌsɪdiəˈzoʊɔɪd/ | n. |  个体海鞘；海鞘群体的单个成员 | An individual zooid of a colonial ascidian (sea squirt).  A single member of a compound ascidian colony. |  Example: The ascidiozooids are interconnected by a common stolon.  这些个体海鞘通过共同的匍匐茎相互连接。

Example:  Researchers studied the reproductive cycle of the ascidiozooids. 研究人员研究了个体海鞘的繁殖周期。 | 近义词: zooid, individual (in the context of colonial organisms) | 反义词: colony (in the context of individual organisms) | 词性: noun

Etymology:  From "ascidian" + "-zooid". "Ascidian" comes from the Greek "askidion," meaning "little bag," referring to the sac-like body of these animals. "-zooid" is a suffix denoting an individual animal forming part of a colony.
