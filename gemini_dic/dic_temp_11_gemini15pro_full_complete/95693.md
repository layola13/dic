incondensibility:/ɪnkɒndɛnsɪˈbɪlɪti/ | n. | 不可浓缩性，不可压缩性 |  The incondensibility of certain gases makes them difficult to store efficiently.  Certain gases exhibit incondensibility under normal conditions, meaning they cannot be easily converted to a liquid state. | 例句：The incondensibility of helium at room temperature makes it difficult to liquefy. 氦在室温下的不可浓缩性使其难以液化。

The incondensibility of the gas posed a challenge for the engineers designing the storage tank.  这种气体的不可压缩性给设计储罐的工程师带来了挑战。 | 近义词：incompressibility, noncondensability | 反义词：condensability, compressibility | 词性: noun


ETYMOLOGY->
From in- (not) + condensable + -ity (suffix forming nouns of quality or state).  Condensable comes from condense, ultimately from Latin condensare "to make dense," from com- "together" + densare "to make thick," from densus "dense, thick."
