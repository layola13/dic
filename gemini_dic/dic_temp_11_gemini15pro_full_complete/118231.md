mercator projection: /mərˈkeɪtər prəˈdʒekʃən/ | n. | 墨卡托投影 | A cylindrical map projection presented by the Flemish geographer and cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569. It is widely used for navigation charts because it represents lines of constant course as straight segments, but it distorts areas and distances away from the equator.  | Example: Navigators rely heavily on Mercator projections. 航海家非常依赖墨卡托投影。

Example: The Mercator projection makes Greenland appear much larger than it actually is. 墨卡托投影使格陵兰岛看起来比实际大得多。

| 近义词: cylindrical projection 圆柱投影 | 反义词: (No direct antonym, but other map projections like Gall-Peters or Robinson are often contrasted with it)  没有直接的反义词，但其他地图投影，如高尔-彼得斯或罗宾逊投影，经常与之对比 | 词性: noun
