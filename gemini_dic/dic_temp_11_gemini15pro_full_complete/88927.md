注意事项:

“Holden” as an adjective is archaic and rarely used outside of specific contexts like the name Holden or the phrase "holden against" meaning "resisted or withstood."  Its primary contemporary usage is as a proper noun (surname or given name, often Australian).  Therefore, constructing grammatically correct sentences using "holden" as an adjective in various tenses can feel forced and unnatural.  The examples provided are for illustrative purposes to fulfill the prompt's requirements, but they might not reflect common usage.
