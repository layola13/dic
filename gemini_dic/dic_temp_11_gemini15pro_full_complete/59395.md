词源:
From Middle English *erst, from Old English ǣrest (“first, at first, firstly, for the first time, soonest, most readily”), from Proto-Germanic *airistaz (“earliest”), superlative of *air (“early”). Cognate with Old Frisian ērest, ērst (“first”), Old Saxon ērist (“first”), Old High German ērist (“first”), Gothic 𐌰𐌹𐍂𐌹𐍃𐍄𐍃 (airists, “first”).  More at erst.  The -t ending arose by analogy with superlatives in -st (such as latest, nearest).
