注意事项:

"Ain't" is considered non-standard English. While it is commonly used in informal spoken English, especially in some dialects, it is generally avoided in formal writing and speech.  Its etymology traces back to contractions of "am not" and "are not" and has evolved over time to encompass other negated forms of "to be" and "to have."
