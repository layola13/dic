ETYMOLOGY->
From the early 17th century. Origin uncertain, possibly from a playful alteration of *bandling, from band ("bond") + -ling, referring to a child wrapped in swaddling bands.  Alternatively, it could be related to the obsolete verb bant ("to bounce or toss a child playfully").  The derogatory sense of "illegitimate child" arose later.
