counteradaptation:/ˌkaʊntərˌædæpˈteɪʃn/ | n. | 反适应，对抗适应 | An adaptation in one species that evolves in response to an adaptation in another species with which it interacts. This process can lead to an evolutionary arms race. | Example 1: The rough-skinned newt developed a powerful toxin as a counteradaptation to the garter snake's resistance to toxins. 粗皮蝾螈进化出一种强大的毒素，作为对袜带蛇毒素抵抗力的反适应。

Example 2: The evolution of camouflage in prey animals is often a counteradaptation to the improved hunting skills of predators. 猎物动物的伪装进化通常是对捕食者狩猎技能提高的反适应。 | 近义词: countermeasure, counterstrategy | 反义词: adaptation | 词性: noun
