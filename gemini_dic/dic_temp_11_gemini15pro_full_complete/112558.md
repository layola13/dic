词源:  "lovelify" is a relatively modern word formed by combining "lovely" (meaning beautiful or attractive) with the suffix "-ify" (meaning to make or cause to become).  "Lovely" itself comes from the Old English word "luflic," meaning "loving" or "worthy of love." The suffix "-ify" is derived from the Latin "-ficare" and ultimately from "-facere," meaning "to make" or "to do."
