注意事项:  This word is rarely used in the plural form.  The singular "inconvenience" is much more common.  The possessive form "inconvenience's" would typically only be used if the inconvenience "possesses" something,  for instance "the inconvenience's impact on traffic was significant."  Even then, rephrasing to "the impact of the inconvenience on traffic" would be more natural.
