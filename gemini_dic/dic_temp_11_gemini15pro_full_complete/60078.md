The word "eejity" is not a recognized word in standard English dictionaries.  It's likely a misspelling, a neologism (newly coined word), slang, or a word from a specific dialect.  Therefore, I cannot provide a standard lexical analysis.

However, if you meant "identity," here's the analysis:

identity: /aɪˈdɛntɪti/ | n. | 身份；同一性；一致；特性 | The state or fact of being the same one as described.  |  He struggled with questions of identity. 他一直在努力探寻自身的身份认同。 | Example: The police are trying to establish the identity of the victim. 警方正试图确认受害者的身份。| Synonyms: individuality, personality, character | Antonyms: anonymity, difference | Noun

identity: /aɪˈdɛntɪfaɪ/ | v. | 确定；识别；使等同于| To recognize somebody or something and say or prove who or what they are. | Example:  The witness identified the suspect in the lineup. 目击者在队列中认出了嫌疑人。 | Synonyms: recognize, pinpoint, distinguish | Antonyms: confuse, mistake | Verb
