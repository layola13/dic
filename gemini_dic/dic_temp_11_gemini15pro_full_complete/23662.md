注意事项:  Brandt can be used both literally (as a physical mark) and figuratively (as a mark of disgrace or distinction).  It's important to consider the context to understand the intended meaning.  Additionally,  while "brandt" exists as a surname, its usage as a common noun meaning "brand" or "mark" is archaic and less common.  The modern spelling for this meaning is "brand."
